[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"EXPLAINING HUMAN ORIGINS MYTH, IMAGINATION AND CONJECTURE In this revised version of the French original, Wiktor Stoczkowski, an anthropologist, argues that the theories of human origins de- veloped by naturalists, archaeologists and physical anthropologists from the early nineteenth century to the present day are structurally similar to modern popular theories, and to the speculations of ear- lier philosophers. Reviewing a r emarkable range of thinkers writing in a variety of European languages, he makes a convincing argu- ment for this case. Even though the book highlights the paucity of development in scientific explana tions of human origins, it ends with an optimistic conclusion about the power of the scientific ap- proach to deliver more reliable theories – but only if it is conscious of the baggage it carries over from popular discourse.

C. A. Sainte-Beuv e, Portraits litt ́ eraires  Custom requires famous scholars to be depicted alongside their preferred instruments o fobservation: Copernicus with an astrolabe in his hand, Galileo looking through a telescope, Pasteur bending intently over a microscope. In the common-sense imaginary, the scientist is first and foremost an observer of the world, and all his knowledge can proceed only from observation. The history and sociology o fscience have importantly rectified this na ̈ ıve picture, by demonstrating that scientific thought is subject not only to the force of the empirical  but also, and sometimes even more so, to social constraints. However, are empirical and social elements sufficient to explain the content o fscientific theories? Can scholarly knowledge be reduced to the results o fa more or less complicated interplay bet- ween ‘facts’ and various ‘social’ factors, such as fashionable theories, paradigms, ideologies and power relations within the scientific commu- nity? It seems the answer must be negative, for although the empirical and the social may explain why the scientist favours a particular concep- tion to the detriment o fsome other, this does not tell us how the ideas, whether accepted or rejected, are formed, and why they are as they are. Imagination is the true source o fscientific theories. But what kind o fimagination? One deemed appropriate for mod- ern art: free, indomitable, allied to pure fantasy? Or one described by Emile Zola: disciplined, exploring the territory conquered by science,  Sainte-Beuve  /  , II :  .  The term empirical has two main meanings today: in everyday language it means knowledge that remains on the spontaneous or common-sense level; in philosophy, it is applied to knowledge founded on experience or on factual data. It will be used here systematically in the second sense. "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" Introduction and resorting to intuition only when faced with the unknown, clearing the way for science? The answer is neither of these types of imagination, both invented, illusory, mere creations o fa third type o fimagination, the only one that really exists. This imagination, familiar to ethnologists, is not a faculty that enables us to step outside the conceptual box in which we are confined; on the contrary, it actually creates the box itself, and it is inside its enclosed space that – as Paul Veyne says  – religions and litera- tures are moulded, as are politics, behaviours and theories. The sides of this conceptual box, while not eternal and unchanging, can nevertheless remain fixed over long periods o ftime and o ften seem so transparent that we are not even aware o ftheir existence, just like a fly that keeps coming up against a glass pane and remains oblivious o fthe obstacle. We have already learnt to study the boxes o fothers, those distant from us in space or time: this is done very skilfully by ethnologists and by historians. But would the fly itsel fbe able to study the invisible pane which impedes its own flight? In taking up such a challenge, the author, an anthropologist by training, has been quite naturally concerned with the conditioning undergone by the imagination o fthe academic tribe o f which he is part. The problem o forigins o fhumanity and culture, cons- tantly pondered over millennia, provides a convenient opportunity for reconstructing a na ̈ ıve anthropology widely accepted in western culture. This may enable us to retrace the influence exerted by this shadowy knowledge on present-day scholarly thought. But let there be no mistake. My intention is not to disparage anthro- pological thinking, but rather to understand it and to explain some o fits mechanisms. In such a task, a critical approach is often as useful as it is natural and inevitable; we must not forget that the methodical exercise o fdoubt is the very essence o fscientific thought. To the reader who may find too much scepticism here, I dedicate the ironic recollection which Giovanni Giacomo Casanova (who was also a witty man o fletters) had o f his first tutor: ‘He said that nothing was more uncomfortable than uncer- tainty, and for that reason he condemned thought because it engendered doubt.’   Veyne  :  .  Casanova  /  –  :  ."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"CHAPTER  Prehistory and the conditioned imagination THE INVENTION OF PREHISTORY On n’ouvr e pas un livre de voyages o` u l’on ne trouve des descriptions de caract` eres et de mœurs: mais on est tout ́ etonn ́ e d’y voir que ces gens qui ont tant d ́ ecrit de choses, n’ont dit que ce que chacun savoit d ́ej` a.

The first descrip- tions of this world were in no way new however, so much so that today they provide us with one of the most astonishing testimonies of the power by which a conceptual tradition conditions the observation of new phe- nomena. Throughout the century following Columbus’ first expedition, the conquistadors and colonisers remained strongly attached to every- thing that had previously been imagined concerning the existence of some possible other world; the first representations of America were therefore inspired by images that preceded its discovery.  The River Amazon was so called by Carvajal because, he asserted, women similar to those described by Homer had fought heroically against Orellana’s soldiers at the mouth of the Rio Negro. The freakish Ewaipanomas, de- picted by Raleigh as having eyes on their shoulders and mouths between their breasts, came straight out of Pliny’s Natural History , having adorned many of the fanciful geographies of ‘Ethiopia’, Asia and the Far East. Towns and exploits that had figured in the tales of chivalry, Old Testa- ment prophecies, Greco-Roman myths – such as that of Atlantis and of the Hesperides – catalogues of fantastic bestiaries, medieval legends like the kingdom of Prester John, all were in turn transplanted to American soil, thus colouring these ancient reveries with a semblance of reality.

For it had in fact existed for centuries in Tradition: Columbus evokes the Greeks and Romans. What was sought for was something “known” that had never been seen.’  In this respect, the discoverers of the New World remind us of the first explorers who, a few centuries later, would set off in search of prehistory. ‘The unknown surrounds the scientist who ventures into the ocean of prehistori cages’: Emile Cartailha c’s remark, written in  , is redo- lent of adventure, with all the romance and the unpredictability that it conjures.  The science of prehistory had only just been born, but already the unknown evoked by Cartailha cwas thoroughly relative: the tradi- tional view of the human past projected from the very outset a curious light on everything that met the pioneers ’ eyes. The most eloquent ex- amples of this – because of their simplicity – date from the eighteenth century. When John Bagford in  reported the discovery in London of a biface tool beside the molar of a mastodon, it seemed obvious to him that this could only be the spearhead of an Ancient Briton, lying with the remains of an elephant brought to the Island by the legions of the Emperor Claudius.  In a similar vein, the mammoth tusks uncovered in Siberia at the same period were often interpreted as the remains of ele- phants that had reached north either with an invading Greek or Roman army, or carried there by the biblical Flood.  In both cases, enigmatic fossils have been easily fitted into the framework of a pre-established view of the past; a past considered as known, familiar and domesticated, made up of biblical themes and references to ancient history.  The tendency to explain new phenomena in terms of traditional con- cepts can be seen with the same clarity in the discovery of prehistory as in that of America, but an important difference precludes pushing this analogy too far. Voyages across the Atlantic were preceded by countless ‘dream peregrinations’ which made of America a confused reflection of imaginary prefigurations of the ‘Antipodes’. The New World was thus invented before it was discovered, whereas prehistory seems at first sight to have emerged out of nothing: at the time of the first discoveries, all  Eliade  :  ; Mahn-Lot  :  ; Greenblatt  .  Kappler  :  .  Cartailhac  : iii.  J.

Interpreters of the tradition asserted that the world and hu- manity were created but a few millennia ago, and that History was fully accounted for in the Bible and in the texts of classical Antiquity. It seems that there was apparently no room in the western imagination for a dreamed prehistory, which preceded the discovery of traces of the real prehistory. The first non-mythical conception of human existence be- fore History would be that put forward by archaeologists and geologists, arising from a void to replace the religious dogmas. ‘Attempts to ex- plain human origins’, certain palaeoanthropologists say today, ‘go back at least several thousand years, but only in the past hundred years or so have scientific methods begun to make headway against mythical and theological versions of creation.’  According to this point of view, scientists set out to conquer a pre- historic past that had been recently rediscovered. Having as their only enemy the errors of religious beliefs, all they had to do was to choose: either they could reject the biblical Genesis, which might ultimately be transformed into an allegory of obscure significance, or they could adopt a hostile stance towards the naturalist view, in defence of the Christian doctrine. Many pages have been written on the role of prehistory and palaeon- tology in the conflict between science and religion. We are not going to linger here over that question, although it deserves a much more thorough analysis than it usually receives. This is to emphasise that the biblical narrative still frequently passes for the only imaginary prefigu- ration of the origins of man produced by western culture before science seized the issue. For many, the burgeoning naturalist view, which collided head on with that of the book of Genesis, was developed in a kind of conceptual vacuum, and the imagination of the scientists had been thus free of the kind of conditioning that had influenced the first explorers of America. The habit of reducing scientists’ statements on the subject of pre- history to mere inferences from archaeological data seems to be one of the considerable consequences of this view of the beginning of pre- historic research: since all knowledge derives from the empirical, the empirical should explain everything. It is easy to accept that in order to understand conquistadors’ accounts of men with their mouths between their breasts, even the most profound knowledge of sixteenth-century  Zihlman and Lowenstein  :  ."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" Explaining human origins Amazonian peoples is insufficient. On the other hand, the knowledge of archaeological and palaeontological remains is deemed sufficient to explain what scholars say about the origins of man, and these vestiges are constantly invoked whenever differences and controversies arise in the numerous debates of prehistorians and palaeontologists. But the naturalist conception of the origins of humankind and culture did not emerge like a deus ex machina thanks to the first discoveries of the material remains of the prehistori cpast. It is true that the s cienti fi cview of anthropogenesis is, up to a point, the fruit of those discoveries, but it is not satisfactorily explained by them in its totality. In order to understand its distinctive features and its peculiar logic, we have to reconstruct an ‘imaginary’ prehistory that preceded the blossoming of scientific prehis- tory and yet did not belong in the domain of religious thought. To grasp the anthropological interest of this recourse to history, we could start with a detour that compels us first of all to go ‘back to school’. WHAT EVERY SCHOOLCHILD KNOWS In primary school, we learn that ‘only archaeological excavations ... enable us to know about the life of prehistori cpeople’.  Oddly enough, schoolbooks promptly make the explanation suspect by putting forward a host of conjectures and explanations which can hardly be derived from the modest material remains spared by time and discovered by the archaeologist through excavations. Not surprising, you may say: the distortions that schoolbooks purvey are well known. Historians, ethnologists and sociologists have already shown that history as taught in school is often swayed by the demands of ideologies, fashions and local intellectual traditions.  But what is true of the teaching of historical periods is not necessarily true of prehistory. It is surprising to find that conceptions of prehistory in school manuals display a remarkable uniformity from one country to another, even though views of historical periods may differ widely. It might perhaps be tempting to conclude that ancient and little-known times are not a fertile ground for ideological didacticism, and therefore that prehistory is spared, present- ing the same objective image everywhere. But to assume that an image is objective merely because it is shared seems to jump to unwarranted con- clusions. And such is indeed the case: prehistorians recognised long ago  Milza et al.  :  ; also Korovkin  :  ; Bazylevic et al.  :  ; Ourman et al.  :  ; Gralhon  :  ; Chambon and Pouliqueu  :  .  E.g.

Its analysis offers us therefore a priceless opportunity to reconstitute the knowledge that we have been innocently imbibing from very early childhood. The view of the Palaeolithic, the pe- riod considered to be that of human and cultural origins, will be the main subject of my analysis.  I shall restrict it to schoolbooks from France and the former Soviet Union, chosen to represent two poles of European tradition. Genesis according to schoolbooks Palaeolithi cpeople are presented to children as the embodiment of our first ancestors. Starting with a description of the natural environment, all the schoolbooks paint the same picture of prehistoric life. Soviet children learn, as do French children, that it was very cold then and that nature was hostile, teeming with savage animals: ‘The mountains and caves sheltered the most fearsome enemies of men – lions, bears and hyena.’  Our earliest ancestors roamed the sinister ‘icy desert’  inhabited by wild beasts actively seeking human flesh, or at the very least threatening, if only because of their huge size. It is easy to guess the unenviable fate of people living in such a terri- fying world. Indeed, schoolbooks provide a spectacle full of dread. Our ancestors led a difficult existence, exposed to the constant dangers of cold and hunger. Fear was their daily companion, death stalked them: ‘Some perished under the claws of predators, others – from disease and cold.’  So they were all doomed to atrocious suffering and their lives were necessarily reduced to the most basic needs: ‘People had one con- cern only – the search for food.’  Hence the descriptions of desperate, starving bands roaming about in a wearisome quest for prey. The schoolbooks are unanimous in stressing that the Palaeolithic was the period of human origins. It was then that humankind ‘learnt’, ‘began’,  E.g. Perl` es  .  Given the strong resemblances between the first chapters of history books in every country, we can restrict our analysis to a few French and Soviet schoolbooks, representing two traditions fairly remote from each other: USSR: Korovkin  ; Nieckina and Lejbengrub  ; Bazylevic et al.  ; France: Milza, Bernstein and Gauthier  ; Ourman et al.  ; Vincent et al.  ; Gralhon  .  Bazylevic et al.  :  .  Nieckina and Lejbengrub  :  .  Korovkin  :  .  Gralhon  :  ; see also Ourman et al.  :  ."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" Explaining human origins ‘discovered’, ‘noticed’, ‘invented’ – these are the verbs that punctuate their narratives. In particular, humankind ‘learnt’ to make tools, to mas- ter fire, to live in groups and to build shelters. Occasionally added to this list are clothmaking and the invention of religion and magic. So the list comprises technology, social organisation and religion – in short, culture. It is the origin of culture that the schoolbooks set out to explain. Let us then examine the ‘causal’ relations put forward to elucidate the origin of tools, of the use of fire, of social organisation and of religion, not just in order to criticise their assuredly frequent inaccuracies or to poke fun at their very flagrant na ̈ ıvet ́ e: these inaccuracies and na ̈ ıvet ́ es are interesting in so far as they reveal the tacit principles that govern the commonsense view of prehistory and give it great coherence. We shall start with the origin of tools, explanations for which are highly consistent. Here are a few examples: Men did not have powerful paws, or claws and teeth as strong as those of the big ferocious animals. But a tool was harder than teeth and claws, and a blow with a club more fearsome than a blow from a bear’s paw.  In order to defend themselves more effectively, men made weapons and tools.  The axe ... increased their strength tenfold.  So our forebears would have started making tools simply because they were exposed to attacks from powerful animals and because nature had denied them the weapons with which other creatures were endowed. To confront an animal in the struggle for survival, our ancestor was obliged to ‘increase his strength tenfold’; the tool became an extension of his body, a substitute for claws and teeth. The origin of the mastery of fire is explained along similar lines: However, people noticed that this awesome fire could also be a loyal friend: it gave warmth in bad weather and protection against carnivorous animals ... At night, ferocious beasts dared not attack people sitting round a fire.  Fire – was of major importance. Without fire men risked dying of cold ... The use of fire made the life of men easier. They could warm themselves at the hearth and protect themselves from the cold; with the help of fire they could ward off wild animals.  Fire was in demand because it lighted the cave, putting the bears to flight.   Korovkin  :  .  Ourman et al.  :  .  Milza et al.  :  .  Korovkin  :  .  Nieckina and Lejbengrub  :  –  .  Milza et al.  :  ."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Prehistory and the conditioned imagination  This amazing discovery would bring them warmth and light, but also a means of defence against wild beasts who are in fear of fire.  Protection against cold or fierce beasts is the common point of all these rationalisations. As in the case of tools, the use of fire is explained by the postulated conditions of the natural environment: cold and the menace of animals. Schoolbooks devote a lot of space to explaining the origins of social life. Here too we find highly repetitive formulae: The first men could not live a solitary existence: they wouldn’t have been able to get food or preserve fire. They would have died of hunger or become the prey of ferocious beasts.  People lived and worked in groups. This was very important. They would have perished if they had lived alone. They wouldn’t have been able either to defend themselves against wild beasts or to find food.  Having only a club, a hunting spear and rudimentary tools at their disposal, men couldn’t struggle alone against a hostile nature and carnivorous beasts. Danger lurked at every step. It was only by cooperation that men were able to defend themselves against attacks by animals and acquire essential food.  To protect themselves against cold, these people lived in groups.  Men grouped together for hunting.  Living in groups, according to the schoolbooks, was thus a necessity imposed by the constraints of the environment and the weakness of our ancestors, unable to survive without the constant assistance of their fellows. The emergence of religion is commented on at length in the Soviet schoolbooks: Man ... experienced fear in the face of nature ... Unable to understand the causes of natural phenomena, he explained them by the intervention of mysterious, supernatural forces ... Religious beliefs prevented him from seeking the true explanation of natural phenomena.  More than once man had found himself powerless in the struggle against nature, on which he was totally dependent. Fear of the menacing and incomprehensible forces of nature gave rise to a belief in the supernatural power of the spirits of nature and then a belief in gods.

It impeded the search for truth, leading man along a path where he could find neither instruction nor knowledge.  French schoolbooks do not comment directly on the origin of religion but they devote some attention to the function of Palaeolithic art which, in their view, would have constituted one of the chief manifestations of Palaeolithic religion, frequently associated with magic: What, in fact, is the significance of the paintings of animals on the walls of the caves at Niaux, at Lascaux and at Altamira (Spain)? It was to ensure the success of the hunt: the animal to be killed was represented in as lifelike a way as possible, then it was killed with three arrows in the drawing. This cast a ‘spell’ which should ensure a fruitful hunt.  On the walls of their caves,  ,  years ago, the men of Niaux and Pech-Merle drew the animals they hunted, perhaps in order to secure a more fruitful hunt.  To explain the birth of religion, Soviet schoolbooks claim that ‘feeble humans’ invented religion as a solace, searching in the creations of their imagination for an escape from the fears inspired by a ‘hostile nature’. Represented as primitive and unsound science, Palaeolithic religion as- sumes a utilitarian character. In France also, the emphasis put on the utilitarian function reduces art and magic to problems of subsistence. Art would thus have been so close to the elementary needs of Palae- olithic people that its principles seem to prefigure social realism: ‘Man endeavoured to represent what he saw around him. Usually he depicted hunting which supplied food.’  So, in both France and Russia magic and religion are presented to pupils as a creation of hungry hunters trying to satisfy needs far removed from any cultural dimension. Whatever the area of culture may be, its origins are accounted for by one rationalisation and one only: our ancestors created culture because they were cold, hungry and frightened. Moreover, the verb ‘to create’, suggesting inventiveness and a spirit of enterprise, does not appear. One should rather say: the first humans ‘began’ and ‘learnt’. That being so, it was because they were constrained to ‘begin’ and ‘learn’; otherwise they could not have survived. The schoolbooks are not alone in propagating this view. Comic strips offer a similar picture of the life of our Palaeolithic forebears. In France this can be seen in a popular series narrating the fortunes of the young hunter Rahan.

Rosny Aˆ ın ́ e’s romans pr ́ ehistoriques have recently benefited from the success of a movie version of La guerre du feu , by Jean-Jacques Annaud, who has not omitted a single one of the classic attributes of our pitiful origins. This view is so widespread and so popular that we are tempted to consider it credible and vouched for by science. Although the authors of schoolbooks assure us that their picture of prehistory is the outcome of meticulous work by archaeologists, it is difficult to accept that prehis- toric vestiges can justify such statements about a diabolically menacing nature, the feebleness of the first humans and the resulting origins of cul- ture. The true sources of this vision must undoubtedly be sought outside archaeology. THE PREHISTORY OF THE PHILOSOPHERS In order to understand the roots of this view, we must consider a prehis- tory that predates the prehistorians, and go back to times when nobody yet suspected the wealth of material vestiges of the human past lying buried in geological strata. The second half of the eighteenth century, before the emergence of prehistory as an academic discipline, seems to be the ideal period for such a study, because a host of thinkers were then pondering on the life of the first humans and the origin of culture. This subject was of special interest to French and Scottish philosophers and it is to their writings that we shall turn our attention. It is often thought that the ‘noble savage’ was one of the main char- acters in the anthropological conjectures of the Enlightenment. Indeed ‘noble savages’ then peopled the pages of travellers’ narratives and philo- sophical treatises, in which descriptions of the virtues of ‘primitives’ jostle with criticism of those who are ‘civilised’. However, even if the educated European of the day indulged in stern self-examination, he remained an optimist, often believed in progress and would have felt no great en- thusiasm for a return to an original state of ‘pure nature’.

In works of the eighteenth-century thinkers, the origin of culture usu- ally opens up the history of humanity,  although this epoch of origin may be preceded by a more perfect,  even paradisal  kind of existence that ends in a cataclysm, reducing our species to the precultural state. So the history of culture starts, or restarts, from scratch. Let us stay with this view of the beginning, in order to study the attributes com- monly ascribed then to the natural environment and to early human existence. Buffon provides this image of our ancestors’ environment: they ‘were witnesses of the convulsive motions of the earth, which were then fre- quent and terrible. For a refuge against inundation they had nothing but the mountains, which they were often forced to abandon by the fire of volcanoes. They trembled on the ground which shook under their feet. Naked in mind as well as in body, exposed to the injuries of every element, victims to the rapacity of ferocious animals.’  Similarly, Nicolas-Antoine Boulanger sketches a frightening picture of the nature in which the few survivors of the Flood lived: ‘So it was a time when the wretched inhabitants of the earth had to look with disgust on their dwelling place, which was the scene of the most terrible catastro- phes’ and when man had ‘so many legitimate reasons to hate a nature that denied him everything, that destroyed even his hut, that constantly alarmed him and satisfied hardly any of his needs’.  Voltaire, in his Essai sur les mœurs , says that in the beginning, ‘carnivorous beasts ... must have covered the earth and devoured a portion of the human species’,  an opinion shared by James Burnet, who speaks of ‘a time when the wild beasts disputed with us the empire of the earth’.   See Lovejoy  .  Condorcet  /  ; Ferguson  ; Holbach  /  ; Home  ; Millar  /  ; Rousseau  /  ; Voltaire  /  .  Boulanger  .  E.g.

The view our philosophers had of the way our an- cestors lived also reminds us of the school image. Buffon presents the first humans ‘penetrated with the common sentiment of terror and pressed by necessity’.  Boulanger conjures up ‘a life of wretchedness and terror’, ‘the harsh and unbearable existence’, ‘the uncertain, anxious, wandering life’ which plunges humankind into ‘a profound melancholy’.  Holbach depicts primordial man as ‘a child without resources, experience, reason or industry, continually suffering hunger and destitution, who finds him- self constantly obliged to fight against wild animals’.  In L’esprit des lois , Montesquieu assumes that our ancestors experienced first and foremost ‘a sense of their own weakness’, which must inevitably have been allied with the distressing ‘sense of their needs’.  In this sad state, ‘men were chiefly concerned with obtaining the means of survival and with going about the tasks directly essential to their existence’.  To satisfy those needs, they had to create culture. That is in a nutshell how the Enlightenment philosophers explain the origin of tools, of social life and of religion. According to Voltaire, ‘men could defend themselves against fierce ani- mals only by hurling stones and arming themselves with great branches of trees’.  Stones and clubs would have been their first weapons, and primitive combat against a fierce animal is sufficient to explain their origin.  Helv ́ etius settled for a similar argument when he tried to throw light on the origin of social life: ‘men joined forces against the animals, their common enemies’.  James Burnet takes the same line: ‘Another motive which I mentioned as inducing men to enter into society, was self-defence; the necessity of which will appear the greater if we consider two things: first, that man is by nature weaker and not so well armed as many of the beasts of prey, and secondly that he is the natural prey of all those beasts.’  Broad justifications for the genesis of religion are particularly worthy of attention.

Men filled nature with spirits because they were almost always ignorant of the true causes.’  Voltaire appealed to introspection to support the same argument: In order to know how all these cults or superstitions became established, it seems to me that we must follow the march of the human spirit left to itself. A settlement of virtual savages sees the fruits that feed it die; a flood destroys some huts; others are burned by thunder. Who has done them this evil? It cannot be one of their fellow beings, because all have suffered equally: it must therefore be some secret power that has harmed them, so it must be appeased.  This way of reasoning would be followed later by the authors of school- books. The oppression of the first humans helps to explain the birth of religion, but religion’s very existence is already seen as proof of our an- cestors’ misfortunes. Nicolas-Antoine Boulanger was convinced of this when he wrote: ‘If men had been happy, they would have had no motive for thus plunging into sadness, their worship would have been made up of joy, of praise, of gratitude for the blessings of nature and admiration for the works of the Creator; they would not have invented thousands of devices to cast down the soul, to poison their days with perpetual weeping, and to make their existence miserable.’  Thus, the philosophical vision of the ‘earliest times’ corresponds al- most exactly to prehistory as taught in schools. Without embarking on research that would demand a thorough historical investigation into the possible influences of Enlightenment philosophy on today’s schools pro- grammes, we need only observe that both of these, separated by two centuries, mobilise the same stock of images to reconstruct the life of our first ancestors and the origin of culture. It is possible, though more difficult, to retrace the history of this im- agery by going further back in time. In Lucretius’ poem De rerum natura (first century BC ) we find a conception whose principal lines are curiously similar. Here is how the philosopher-poet imagined the existence of the earliest humans: But what gave them trouble was rather the races of wild beasts which would often render repose fatal to the poor wretches. And, driven from their home, they would flee from their rocky shelters on the approach of a foaming boar or a strong lion ... They would ... shelter in the brushwood their squalid limbs when driven to shun the buffetings of the winds and rains.  So humans led a miserable existence, ‘wandering terror stricken’.  ‘It was a necessity that mortal men ... should have been able to denote  Holbach  /  :  .  Voltaire  /  , I :  .  Boulanger  , I :  .  Lucretius, trans.

The opinions of Lucretius on religion and its origins also resemble those that would mark the Enlightenment philosophy and modern common sense: ‘And now what cause has ... implanted in mortals a shuddering awe which raises new temples of the gods?’  Lucretius explained it by the action of imagination which presented people with images of perfect beings, but, chiefly, by ignorance: ‘They would see the system of heaven and the different seasons of the year come round in regular succession and could not find out by what causes this was done; therefore they would seek a refuge in handing over all things to the gods.’  That,hesays,is how religion was born, ‘subjugating’ people by a kind of ‘superstitious terror’. And the Roman poet exclaims pathetically: ‘O hapless race of men, when that they charged the gods with such acts and coupled with them bitter wrath! What groaning did they beget for themselves, what wounds for us, what tears for our children’s children!’  We are often reminded that Lucretius’ poem was favourite reading of Enlightenment philosophers. A study of the relations – rich in borrow- ings, reworkings and transformations – interwoven between Antiquity and the eighteenth century would require a separate and more far- reaching survey than the limited ambitions of my undertaking. Suffice it to say that Lucretius, still republished in large printruns in our own day, was not the only ancient author whose texts, in the eighteenth century, provided ideas useful to feed the conjectural reconstructions of miser- able human origins. We can find different ingredients of this vision in the second century BC in Polybius,  in the first century BC in Diodorus Siculus,  Vitruvius  and Cicero.  Later, in the fourth century, they would re-emerge in the writings of Gregory of Nyssa  and Nemesius;  a belated medieval trace appears in the eleventh century with the Byzantine monk Tzetzes.  Fierce beasts threatening the first humans is, moreover, a widespread motif in ancient literature from the fifth century  Ibid .:  .  Ibid .:  .  Ibid .:  .  Ibid .:  .  Ibid .:  .  Polybius  , book VI .  Diodorus Siculus  :  .  Vitruvius  , book II .  .  De republica , reproduced in Lovejoy and Boas  /  :  .  Gregory of Nyssa  :  –  .  Nemesius  :  –  .  Cole  :  ."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" Explaining human origins BC on, as is the theme of the physical inferiority of humans in relation to animals.  So the ideas concerning human weakness and the hostility of nature are ancient (‘ natura non mater, sed noverca ’, wrote Cicero).  They were often used as commonplaces, together or singly, to construct var- ied theories, sometimes far removed from the view of miserable origins. They would later be found on different occasions in theological con- ceptions, despite the fact that the Christian doctrine places the earliest humans, strong and perfect, in the welcoming environment of Eden; the same topoi can be used as stereotypical raw material in discourses whose principal theses might be strongly original and oppose one another on philosophical or theological planes. Despite its fluctuating popularity over the centuries, the components of what would become in the eighteenth century the view of the miserable origins has persisted in European culture for more than two millennia. These basic images of conjectural prehistory, recurring in nat- uralist thought from the middle of the eighteenth century, triumphed in the following century and became the very kernel of evolutionist theory; they are easy to find in the works of Herbert Spencer, Charles Darwin, Alfred R. Wallace, Lewis H. Morgan, John F. McLennan, John Lubbock and Edward B. Tylor, to mention only the names of the most eminent and well-known scholars. In the twentieth century, as we have seen, traces of the same conceptions are still present in Western culture. CONJECTURAL HISTORY : A METHOD Although the vision of prehistory held by the Enlightenment philoso- phers seems dubious today, it nevertheless remains coherent, the end result of reasoning that follows sufficiently well-defined rules to lead its users, in different social and historical contexts, to similar conclusions. The image of feeble man and hostile nature remains its starting point, from which it is inferred that the life of the first human beings was de- voted entirely to the struggle for survival; the emergence of culture, an instrument in that fight, would simply be a consequence of it. Such a de- duction implies a few complementary assumptions, almost always passed over in silence as if they were self-evident. Here are the most important:  . Environmental determinism . The behaviour of primitive humans would stem principally from stimuli in their environment. This principle  Anaxagoras, Fragments  b, reproduced in Lovejoy and Boas  /  :  ; Plato  a:  –  .  See also Stoczkowski  ; Blundell  ."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Prehistory and the conditioned imagination  allows no room for conduct imposed by the arbitrary character of cultural conventions, at times running counter to natural constraints.  . Materialism . An assumption closely linked to the previous axiom: it is not just a moderate materialism that is postulated, according to which human existence is not entirely determined by culture, but a very extreme materialism, asserting that material existence fully defines culture and cognition. Our ancestors would have spent their entire time in the search for food,  and it was only rarely, when fortune had smiled on them and the hunting was good, that they had time to think.  These brief moments aside, it is assumed that people did not really think, so cognition could play no part in the genesis of culture.   . Utilitarianism . Everything which humans did would have been an ex- pression of basi cneeds and would always have been dire cted towards practical ends. Tools were nothing more than substitutes for claws and fangs, society was the result of economic cooperation, and religion a means, however imperfect, of combating fear and uncertainty in the face of a mysterious and menacing nature.  . Individualism . The origin of culture would be explained by reference to individual needs alone. It was the individual who was cold, hungry, frightened; he it was who was a prey to terror. The social dimension of culture is thus neatly obliterated. The assumptions of environmental determinism and materialism allow human cognition – believed to be indeterminate and unpredictable – to be eliminated from the anthropological vision, while the assumptions of utilitarianism and individualism banish the equally awkward role of social conventions, the arbitrary and local character of which would get in the way of huge generalisations and historical retrospect. So, what re- mains active is an ecological and biological determinism which provides apparently solid foundations for a deductive reasoning. What could be more simple than reconstructing prehistory! Since it is obvious that in the beginning was the individual, that the individual was weak, determined by nature, and that nature was hostile, nothing could be easier than to foresee, or rather to ‘retrospect’, the behaviour of the first humans and the way culture must have come into being.  See, for example, Korovkin  :  ; Gralhon  :  .  Gralhon  :  .  See, for example, Burnet  –  , I :  ; Boulanger  , II :  ; Condorcet  /  :  ; Home  :  ; Millar  /  :  ; Goguet  , I :  ; Voltaire  /  , I :  ; Virey,  , I :  –  ."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" Explaining human origins This deductive procedure enjoyed a great success in the eighteenth century: ‘when we cannot trace the process by which an event has been produced’, explained Dugald Stewart in  , ‘it is often of importance to be able to know how it may have been produced by natural causes’.  Stewart was one of the first to give a name to this method: To this species of philosophical investigation, which has no appropriated name in our language, I shall take the liberty of giving the title Theoretical or Conjectural History; an expression which coincides pretty nearly in its meaning with that of Natural History as employed by Mr. Hume and with what some French writers have called Histoire Raisonn ́ ee .  The ambitions and rules of the method are very clear. Its aim is to determine the causes of genesis, and the data base on which the explanations must rest are the following:  . A list of elements whose origin calls for explanation (tools, religion, society, etc.).  . The principles of plausible explanations: in accordance with our four axioms, the genesis of a character should be the result of its usefulness for the basi cneeds of the individual, those needs being determined by stimuli from the natural environment.  .

TRANSFORMATIONS OF A MYTH Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this. Ecclesiastes VII .  Let us return to those conceptions which served as a starting point for the arguments of those philosophers who conjectured about the origin of culture. Neither the principles of histoire raisonn ́ ee nor determinist views of human nature are able to clarify the source of the ideas of a ‘hostile nature’ and a ‘weak and suffering primordial man’. These two funda- mental premises of the ‘prehistory’ of the philosophers seem to lead an autonomous existence. The time has come to resort to the term myth, even though its excessive use these days has made it a masker word, lacking any precise meaning.  Stewart  /  : xlii.  Ibid .

While having no sympathy for the fashion that requires us to introduce the word at every turn, I must nevertheless acknowledge that the philosophical and school texts we have just been scanning have some features in common with those traditional myths that are summarily consigned to the category of myths of origin. These myths, when narrating how things came into being, used to answer indirectly another question: why did things come into being?  The same goes for histoire raisonn ́ ee . As Helv ́ etius said, it tells us what happened in ‘the first days of the world’ and attempts to imagine how culture came into being, while trying simultaneously to explain why it did so. However, we must also take into account divergences – no less interest- ing – that separate conjectural ‘prehistory’ from myths of origin. In our culture, a substantial number of traditional narratives situate the begin- nings of humankind in a paradisal world of perfect harmony, free from all the conflicts and heartbreaks that later ages would have to endure. In this primordial period, myths tell us, nature was kind to humans, no seasons interrupted everlasting spring,  the Earth spontaneously pro- vided all creatures with food in such abundance  that neither humans nor animals needed to kill in order to eat; the wolf cropped grass beside the lamb and both were equally mild and obedient to humans, whose hands were unstained not only by the blood of animals but also by that of their fellows.  Mankind lived, shielded from disease and unhappiness, with hearts free from sorrow and full of love.  A comparison between those attributes that a significant part of our cultural tradition associates with a paradisal existence and those attributes claimed by naturalist thought for the period of origins is very instructive.

Until the eighteenth century, the Bible preserved its status as a funda- mental historical work and Moses, the presumed author of the first five books, including Genesis, was called ‘the most ancient of historians, the most sublime of philosophers’.  It was through the Bible, together with Greek and Latin texts, that the myth of original bliss became, in post- classical Europe, the main source of the representations of earliest times. J.-B. Bossuet, who, in his position as tutor to the Dauphin in the years  to  , developed his Discours sur l’histoire universelle , painted this picture of the origins: ‘[Moses] shows us ... the Perfection and Power of Man, how much he bore of the Image of God in his entirety; his Empire over all Creatures; his innocence, together with his Felicity in the Garden of Eden, whose memory is conserv’d in the Golden Age of the Poets’.  The myth of primordial felicity, rooted as much in the biblical tra- dition as in parts of the Greco-Roman legacy, steered people’s dreams towards the earliest times, towards an original perfection that subsequent periods have debased, leaving them little to be proud of in what has been accomplished on Earth; they would have to wait for this world to be destroyed in an apocalypse that would restore a new paradise. It is true that theologians have never been prone to condemn terrestrial toil or practical knowledge. However, the latter, ‘ scientia ’, was in their teaching merely an ‘inferior part of the reason by which humans manage their earthly affairs and profane occupations and try to live correctly in this depraved world’.  No Christian should forget the question in Ecclesiastes I .  : ‘What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?’ The classical mind, inspired by the Bible and the Greco-Roman tra- dition, seems enamoured of immutability, while the rebellious spirit of the Enlightenment, in complete contrast, desires change: change that claims to be development and progress.

Authors who insisted on respecting the authority of the Bible and the Ancients were circumspect in their references to the age of Eden,  but free thinkers could not refrain from bitterness when describing the supposed original happiness of humanity. For Holbach, ‘the savage life or the natural state, to which disgruntled speculators have wanted to return humanity, the Golden Age so praised by the poets are, in truth, nothing but states of wretchedness, imbecility, irrationality. To invite us to return to them is to tell us to return to infancy , to forget all we know, to relinquish the enlightenment our minds have succeeded in acquiring.’  For the generation that was fascinated by the creative power of the human spirit, for the century that would see the goddess of Reason set up on the altar of Notre Dame in Paris, the myth of the Golden Age could easily become an insult. And so Buffon, at the end of his ironic sketch of the comforts of the Golden Age, asked sarcastically: ‘To be happy, what is needed, other than to desire nothing?’ And he continued passionately: ‘If that is so, let us say at the same time that it is sweeter to vegetate than to live, to crave nothing than to satisfy our craving, to lie in apatheti csleep than to open our eyes to see and to feel; let us consent to leave our soul in torpor, our mind in darkness and never to use either, to place ourselves below the animals, in the end to be nothing but masses of crude matter attached to the earth.’  The picture of paradise is presented as a mere eulogy to passivity and inertia. Against this, the Enlightenment set the apotheosis of the active life that must be led down here by humans, as pilgrims seeking truth and happiness by building a civilisation based on reason.

A thousand other monuments of power and of glory sufficiently demonstrate that man is the lord of the earth; that he has entirely changed and renewed its surface; and that from the remotest periods of time, he alone has divided the empire of the world between him and Nature.  So, human beings succeeded, by dint of hard work, in planting with their own hands the Garden of Paradise. For the landscape Buffon paints for us has all of its attributes: ‘Uncultivated nature is hideous and lan- guishing’ and only man can ‘render her agreeable and vivacious.’ Thus will ‘Nature acquire redoubled strength and splendour from the skill and industry of man.’  It is certainly paradise, but transferred from the beginning of History to its end.

At the other extreme, the Golden Age then finds itself replaced by its reverse image. This is how, in the eighteenth century, conceptions were formed that served as the starting point for the deductive reasoning of histoire raisonn ́ ee . The idea of redemption by civilisation is modelled on the well-known pattern of Christian thought. The hope that progress will bring to the people their longed-for bliss revives periodically in the western tradi- tion. Already present among the Epicureans, this hope grew stronger in the eighteenth century and saw its greatest triumph in the century that followed. Charles Fournier, to cite just one example among oth- ers, prophesied the construction of the boreal corona that would supply warmth and light to the arctic regions; the formation of liquid citric acid which, combined with salt, would make the sea taste of lemonade; the destruction of monsters and the  .  degree shift in the axis of the earth so that everlasting spring should reign everywhere.  This kind of technical (or social) utopia is often very hostile to the myth of paradisal origins and displays a marked leaning towards the concep- tion of humble origins; in order to be convinced of this we have only to read the critique of the vision of the Golden Age by Lenin,  or the flamboyant discourse on our pitiful origins included in the programme of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.  It seems that hopes for the future are proportional to pride in the achievements of the past: ‘If it is true that we had brutes for ancestors’, wrote Cl ́ emence Royer in  , ‘the progress already achieved by our race gives us the measure of what we may still achieve, and our humble past shall serve only to give us more magnificent hopes for the future.’  Every time doubt starts gnawing at these hopes, the notion of our mis- erable origins is immediately affected and its popularity rapidly declines. It was in the momentous year of  that Marshall Sahlins, in his famous article ‘The original affluent society’,  proposed to reject the traditional conception of our ancestors’ miserable existence in order to demon- strate that primitive hunters lived in a state of well-being, highly con- trasted with the discomforts of decadent industrial civilisation (Table  ).  Duchet  :  .  Fournier  , I :  .  Lenin, ‘The agrarian question and the “critique” of Marx’, quoted from Boriskovski  :  .  Extracts quoted in Mongait  :  .  Royer  :  .  Sahlins  a."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" Explaining human origins Table  .

And we, of industrial civilisation, want too many things. We produce a lot and want to possess more than we make; this thirst accelerates the senseless rhythm of production, and its demands sentence us to ‘life at hard labour’. So we founder in frustration because consump- tion begins in inadequacy and ends in deprivation.  To this are added inequalities, exploitation and famine, the latter being, in the author’s eyes, the very symbol of the twentieth century. Only primitive hunters are seen as safe from these scourges, and for a very simple reason: they are content with little. So it is easy for them to satisfy all their needs without effort and then to enjoy unrestricted leisure in a free and egali- tarian society. Sahlins speaks with conviction of an original existence in which people enjoyed their food and gave themselves over to carefree digestion.  Ibid .:  –  ."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" Explaining human origins So, alongside a pessimistic view of contemporary civilisation, an idyl- li cvision of the life of primitive hunters reappears. This juxtaposition is based on binary contrasts that bring the classic attributes of paradisal ex- istence and their reverse images into play: material abundance/penury, limited needs/infinite needs, not much work/hard labour, leisure/ absence of leisure, confidence/anxiety, equality/inequality, freedom/ enslavement. Towards the end of the  s, a decade that saw the flow- ering of the counter-culture, no one wanted to reproach Sahlins for the na ̈ ıvet ́ e of his critique of contemporary civilisation. On the other hand, his idealised picture of hunter-gatherers’ life was immediately attacked by ethnologists.  Sahlins had based his bucolic view of primitive existence almost exclusively on highly unrepresentative data furnished by three weeks’ observation of a !Kung group and by three weeks’ observation of two Aboriginal groups in Arnhem Land; the generalisation of those data to all hunter-gatherers, including those of prehistory, is a product of the usual procedures of conjectural history, traditionally rich in fragile extrapolations and unconcerned with providing a sufficient empirical basis for its assertions. This weakness deserves to be emphasised, but it seems of greater interest to observe that Sahlins’ argument, unsatisfactory as it is from an epistemological standpoint, at the same time conforms perfectly well to the rules of transformation of conjectural theories. His description of hunter-gatherers’ way of life corresponds to the vision of the Golden Age, and contemporary civilisation becomes a new avatar of the state of savagery. There is nothing original in that. In particular, the main idea that excessive needs are the chief source of our torments is hardly recent. ‘ Multa potentibus, desunt multa ’, as Horace had written ( Odes III .  ). Besides, it was a central tenet of the Cynics, who maintained that to achieve happiness we must reject artificial desires and confine ourselves to a very few natural needs. And it is precisely those Cynics who have left the first testimony of the revolt of the civilised against civilisation. We might say that they were the first exponents of the counter-culture ethos.  Similar ideas have been formulated again and again, for example at the beginning of the nineteenth century in Romantic literature. The end of the decade of the sixties saw a new flowering of this tradition which does not believe in ‘redemption’ by technical means and dreams of a paradise supposedly destroyed by civilisation.  See ‘Does hunting bring happiness?’ in Lee and DeVore  :  –  .  Lovejoy and Boas  /  :  ."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Prehistory and the conditioned imagination  Sahlins’ article enjoyed a huge success and created a considerable echo, the range of which can notably be measured by the number of its translations. A recent French schoolbook refers to it explicitly, and a subheading in one of its chapters takes the form of this question, long absent from such manuals: ‘The Palaeolithic: a paradise lost?’  There is, of course, no question of the Palaeolithic here, but of ourselves, of the anxieties and hopes inspired by our times. The transformations of conjectural prehistories follow our collective moods, and the image of the primordial period slides towards either the positive or the negative pole of the conventional system of binary oppositions. Yet it would be trivial to conclude that ‘ideology’ or Zeitgeist alone determines visions of our origins. That is true to some extent, in so far as the popularity of different versions of prehistory matches the rhythm of change in social representations. But it is more important to note that these various versions of the conjectural theory of human origins are constructed by permutations of the same generative scheme, limited to a list of Eden-like attributes, twinned with their opposites in binary con- trasts. Spontaneous speculation about our origins is a hotchpotch of pre- fabricated elements that provide the basic data for deductive reasonings whose course thus becomes determined, in large measure, by the nature of this conceptual material, which is always the same. Although each of the visions of earliest times – and the causal explanations flowing from it – has a more or less local character, subject to the moving constraints that are of interest to the historian, their underlying matrix has been un- changing for more than two millennia, serving equally as a foundation for ancient philosophical conjectures and for modern common-sense rep- resentations. Through these divergences, there emerges a genuine longue dur ́ ee structure of western anthropological imagination, partly indepen- dent of changing social and historical circumstances. When pondering on our origins, we have a tendency to move in a limited field of possibilities, where innovations are most often restricted to combinations of conven- tional elements, that can also be arranged into broader compositions; for example, the ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ periods can be multiplied at will and linked together in complex historico-philosophical constructions – decadence, fall and redemption, progress, perverted progress, cycles of progress and decadence, etc. – like letters in an alphabet, whose lim- ited number enables countless words to be formed, or like words, the  Wytteman  :  ; see the image of Eden in a schoolbook of the second half of the nineteenth century, Bachelet  /  :  –  ."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" Explaining human origins raw material of possible sentences infinitely more numerous than the words.

Yet the struggle of humans against di- nosaurs, a very popular image in Europe as well, coul dbe consi dere dnot simply as the manifestation of ignorance, but also as a kin dof knowle dge – one that is erroneous. An erroneous idea does not become less absurd merely for being share dby half the population; it becomes nevertheless interesting as a social phenomenon. In fact, the image of the caveman fighting dinosaurs is not entirely devoid of factual elements: nobody will deny that the dinosaurs really existed, just as prehistoric humans did. On the other hand, the origin of the deep-seated conviction that our ancestors share dthe Earth with the dinosaurs remains obscure, because human remains have never been foun din the same geological forma- tions as dinosaur bones, and no scholar has risked suggesting that our forebears live dalongsi de these giant reptiles. It was laypeople, rather than scientists, who forge dthis i dea, thus bequeathing us an excellent illustration of ordinary thinking at work.  Jacob  :  .  From the results of a survey conducted between  and  , Almquist an dCronin  : Table  . "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" Explaining human origins We shoul dremember that alrea dy Buffon was imagining the worl dof the first humans as ‘a vast desert peopled with monsters’ of which our ancestors ‘often became the prey’; it was only with time that they ‘made the wil dbeasts gra dually retire ... purge dthe earth of those gigantic animals, whose enormous bones are still to be found’.  This passage is very instructive, for it enables us to grasp one of the earliest moments of the encounter between conjectural prehistory an dprehistoric vestiges: on one side, the ‘wild beasts’ which have peopled the imagination for millennia; on the other, the ‘enormous bones’, recently discovered in ancient geological strata. The spontaneous linking of the two as syno- nymous, for which Buffon is not responsible, le dlater to an inevitable identification. Traditional imagery required the rivals of primitive hu- mans to be ‘huge, fierce an dmenacing’.  The size of some of the bones woul dhave been enough in itself to cast animal fossils in that role. When, in the first half of the nineteenth century, palaeontology described the first dinosaurs as enormous, their jaws equipped with long teeth, they be- came ready-made candidates for completion of the prehistoric tableau. Theirimpressivedimensionsandtheterrifyingappearancegiventhemin popular literature fully measured up to the demands of na ̈ ıve imagery, and embarrassing details were scrupulously avoided. What did it mat- ter that the dinosaurs were often vegetarian, that their remains lay in deep strata where there were no traces of humans? Lay thinking chooses from the data only those facts which seem useful and familiar, and these become like actors cast in advance for the roles in a ready-made scenario. The ‘caveman’ image, familiar to every reader because of the scientific backing it receive dfrom the first excavations in the nineteenth century, provides us with another illustration of the same propensity to seek in known data only facts which confirm preconceived ideas. It is commonly admitted that prehistorians were unanimous in thinking that the first humans live dmainly in caves, because they ha dstarte dtheir excavations in caves, easier to locate than open-air sites. However, while discoveries of Palaeolithic remains were for a very long time more numerous in caves than in the open air, the idea of a ‘caveman’ was not necessarily a conclusion drawn from the uneven distribution of archaeological finds. Causality seems to have operate din reverse here: it was the i dea of ‘caveman’ that induced the early prehistorians to explore caves in the first place.

The idea of the caveman, to take just one example, was put to the test not by excavations in caves, which coul dbring only confirma- tion of it, but by counter-evidence found outside caves. However, or- dinary thinking demonstrates a strong tendency to seek confirmation; this is indicated by numerous experiments on the common-sense vali- dation of hypotheses.  When people persist in looking for confirmation without bothering about counter-evidence, empirical data are left with the role of mere illustration: this is a typical procedure of layperson thinking.  A science which takes the same approach runs the risk of remaining confine dto the universe of na ̈ ıve imagery, where novelty finds a place only if it fits in with traditional opinions, and where scholarly hypotheses, conditioned by old ideas, evolve like living species, whose forms are restricte dby a morphological heritage resulting from their long history.

They represent the research traditions of different disciplines and different countries: the Unite dStates, Great Britain, France an dthe for- mer Soviet Union. The American publications are the most numerous: this can be seen either as proof of the important contribution made by American researchers to studies on human origins or else as a sign of their predilection for this particular kind of anthropological literature – the hominisation scenario. In order to have a complete spectrum of diversity, I have included different methodological and even ideological options in the sample: Lamarckism, classic Darwinism, neo-Darwinism, classic Marxism, or- thodox Soviet Marxism, the western version of Marxism, the ecological approach inspired by optimisation models, economic determinism, technical determinism, and demographic, sociobiological and femi- nist approaches. The pre-Darwinian, Darwinian an dneo-Darwinian conceptions are thus represented; as are works belonging to the period preceding the crucial discoveries in East Africa and the period that fol- lowe dthem. However, it is worth stressing that although the various hypotheses testify to a great abundance of ideas, the scenarios I have selecte d do not reflect the entire state of palaeoanthropological knowl- edge. It must not be forgotten that I shall be examining just one type of anthropological literature here, an dnot the discipline in general. (a) Ardrey is only one of the eighteen authors who identify the characteristics of the human ancestor with those of apes; (b) the logical structure of Ardrey’s scenario differs in no way from those of the other texts analysed; (c) Ardrey is one out of some twenty authors who hold ecological change to be the first cause of hominisation an done of fourteen who opt for the classic view of a hostile nature; (d) nofewerthanathirdoftheeighteenmostwidespreadcausalrelationshipsinallthetextsare foun din Ar drey; the explanations in his scenario are most common in the scholarly works; (e) the presence of Ardrey’s scenario does not appreciably change the ratio between the different types of explanation in our sample as a whole (cf. chapter  ): Type of explanation Including Ardrey Excluding Ardrey ‘Traditional’  .  %  .  % ‘Lamarckian’  .  %  .  % ‘Darwinian’  .  %  .  % So it is clear that the inclusion of Ardrey’s book does not significantly change the image of my sample as a whole; on the other hand, it provides an opportunity to demonstrate that this book, universally disparaged, offers explanations which are in fact entirely analogous with those foun din un deniably scholarly works."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"SCENARIOS CHARACTER I II III IV V VI VII VIII IX X XI XII XIII XIV XV XVI XVII XVIII XIX XX XXI XXII XXIII XXIV Tools X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X Bipedalism X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X Free hands X X X X X X X X X X X X X X Language X X X X X X X X X X X X X X Social life X X X X X X X X X X X X X X Voluminous brain X X X X X X X X X X X X X Superior mental X X X X X X X X X X X X faculties Reduced canines X X X X X X X X X X X Cooperation X X X X X X X X Sexual division X X X X X X X X X X of labour Food-sharing X X X X X X X X X X X Hunting X X X X X X X X X X X Perfectibility X X X X X X Family organisation X X X X X Reproductive success X X X X Prolonge dchil dhoo d X X X X Absence of oestrus X X X X Carnivorous diet X X X X X Table  .

It would be difficult to understand the meth- ods and structures of the scenarios that attempt to answer this question without first explaining what their authors understand by ‘humans’. ‘Humans’ are defined by a conglomeration of characteristics that are given the status of distinguishing features of our biological family. Conse- quently, to explain anthropogenesis means to explain the origins of these human characteristics. These are considered to be mutually dependent, an dthe links between them acquire a particular quality in our scenarios, namely that of the relation of cause to effect; the appearance of one ‘human’ characteristic is deemed to lead to the emergence of another, which gives rise to the next one, an dso on, until this etiological sequence reaches the ‘end’ of the hominisation process. If we standardise the terminology which designates ‘human’ charac- teristics in our twenty-four texts, their profusion can be reduced to a list of thirty-eight properties (Table  ). Among them we find, alongside fea- tures suppose dto distinguish humans, a few characteristics (carnivorous or omnivorous diet, scavenging) attributed only to the earliest hominids in comparison with their ancestors, an dplaying, we are tol d, a major role in anthropogenesis. So the human condition in general, or that of the first hominids in particular, is defined by eleven anatomical and five reproductive characteristics, by the use and manufacture of tools, the type of subsistence (four properties) an dsocial life (six properties),"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Anthropogenesis and science  articulate language, the level of mental capacities, spiritual life (three properties), the faculty of perfectibility, mastery of fire and, in general, moral sense an dculture. It is striking that the core of this list, consisting of the most frequently mentione dcharacteristics, has change dvery little over  years. The leading roles are constantly played by attributes such as tools, bipedalism, free hands, language, social life and cooperation. The pair ‘sexual divi- sion of labour’ an d‘foo d-sharing’ makes its appearance in  ,  be- comes fashionable in the seventies an dafterwar ds is one of the recurring elements in the conceptions of hominisation. From  , the list is aug- mente dby other acquisitions: ‘large cranium’ an d‘prolonge dinfancy’, then, in  , ‘disappearance of oestrus’. However, the impression of the novelty of these additions derives only from the limited number of works analysed. All these characteristics had already been brought into play in speculation on anthropogenesis: the pair ‘sexual division of labour’ an d‘foo d-sharing’ is foun din Rousseau;  similarly ‘large cranium’ and ‘prolonge dinfancy’ in Virey in  .  Prolonge dinfancy is mentione d as a typically human characteristic as early as the eighteenth century;  Aristotle himself,  followe dby the whole tra dition of naturalist thought, was already stressing the absence of oestrus in the human species. On the other hand, scavenging is indisputably an innovation on this list. As far as I have been able to establish, our ancestors were first represente das scavengers in  , by G. A. Bartholomew an dJ. Birdsell.  Taken up by K. Oakley  an dJ. D. Clark,  the idea became very popular in the eighties. One curious fact: traditional speculation never envisage dthat the first humans coul dhave been scavengers. It is worth noting that in the western tradition carrion and scavenging have long carrie dextremely negative connotations; the me dieval penitentials, for example, counte dcarrion ( morticina ) among the particularly impure substances, an dthe penance impose dfor consuming it was as long as it was severe.  Right down to the present, carrion has remained unclean for westerners, so it is possible that its symbolic charge may long have helpe dto keep the scavenging hypothesis systematically on the si delines: the accurse dfoo dwas unworthy of our ancestors. Other new attributes, added to the list of ‘human characteristics’ in recent decades, are chiefly concerned with dentition (reduced incisors,  Oakley  .  Rousseau  /  :  .  Virey  , I :  .  E.g.

It remains to this day the prolongation of a deep-rooted tradition. It is a curious tradition. The characteristics it attributes to humans are deemed to distinguish them from the animal world. And yet we have only to take this statement literally for a goo dmany inconsistencies to emerge. Bipeds, humans? Yes, but penguins and ostriches, not to mention chickens, are also bipeds. Demosthenes dodged this difficulty by calling humans ‘featherless bipeds’, but our situation is more complicated because we know that some dinosaurs – also featherless – walked on their two hin dfeet. In the nineteenth century, such objections were alrea dy being labelle d‘frivolous’.  Yet it woul dbe unfair to consi der them out of place an dgratuitous, for they have the merit of highlighting the nee d to define the unique human mode of locomotion not by the vague term of bipedalism but by the precise feature of our particular bipedalism (one bipedalism among others); physical anthropologists have long been capable of doing this, but our scenarios, curiously, neglect to do so. The ‘brain size’ criterion is unsatisfactory too: shoul dwe be prou d of the weight of our brains (  –  kg) compare dwith those of elephants (  –  kg) or whales (more than  kg)? Even if we resort to certain relative measurements, like the ratio of cerebral volume to body weight, the difficulty by no means disappears, for certain small mammals achieve more advantageous ratios than ours.  In order to mark out humans by the size of their brain, we woul dhave to use very complex metho ds of measurement (for example, allometric analysis) an dthese results are not unambiguous either.  Nor is discrimination between humans and animals more firmly establishe dby properties such as ‘social life’, ‘sexual division of labour’, ‘food-sharing’, ‘family organisation’, so long as they continue to be designated in non-quantitative terms so general that they coul djust as well apply to certain animal species. In reply to such criticisms, it can be sai dthat this list of characteristics does not define humans as opposed to animals but, more specifically,  Virey  , I :  .  Cartmill  :  .  Ibid. :  –  ."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Anthropogenesis and science  the contrast between humans an dapes, an dcertain scenarios do state this.

In  , when Linnaeus placed humans alongside apes in the same order of Anthropomorpha, he was merely continuing a long tradition going back to Antiquity.

So this image, too, woul dbe a counter-image of ‘humanity’, an dhumans woul d deny the ape what they wishe dto re- strict for themselves: the use of tools, social life, food-sharing, division of labour, cooperation, hunting, family organisation, etc. Besides, the figure of the ape, as a negative portrait of man, especially of ‘civilised’ man, is a recurrent theme in European culture; it can equally be foun din the imagery of the Middle Ages  as in products of modern mass culture (for example in the film Planet of the apes , base don a novel by Pierre Boulle). These conceptions are not without consequences for the theories of hominisation, since, in most of the scenarios, the ape becomes an actual embodiment of our ancestor, an image of the primordial creature from whom we are descended. This concurs with the very popular idea, ex- presse din the terse formula attribute dto Darwin, that ‘man descen ds from the ape’. Darwin himself, in fact, never did accept this unseemly simplification an dspoke only of the ‘ape-like progenitors of man’.  The authors of our scenarios seem less cautious, or less precise: nineteen of the twenty-four texts analyse di dentify the original state of humans with that of simians and push the analogy very far indeed, not only with regards to anatomy and behaviour but also to social organisation and subsistence. Only five of our authors exercise more restraint, suggesting common ancestors for both the great apes an dhumans, a more appro- priate but much less gratifying opinion since it imposes constraints on the deployment of analogies.  It is easier now to understand why the list of ‘human’ characteristics has changed little despite the discoveries of fossil hominids: the ape – an imaginary ape – continues as before to serve as a model for the portrayal of our ancestor. The definition of humanity is constructed in such a way as to cast the differences between humans and apes in a system of bi- nary oppositions of ‘presence/absence’; so if the ape does not think or cooperate or hunt, it is simply because humans do think, cooperate and hunt.

None the less, even philosophers who practised histoire raisonn ́ ee came to perceive the weaknesses of this type of argument; thus Adam Ferguson, the eighteenth-century Scottish philosopher, wrote: ‘our method, notwithstanding, too frequently is to rest the whole on conjec- ture ... to imagine that a mere negation of all our virtues is a sufficient description of man in his original state’.  This sagacious caution did not however preserve the learne dScot from the trap of which he was well aware.

If the diversity of ideas they put forward is disturbing at first, reading them all together soon produces the same feeling of tedium as we get from the stereotypical uniformity of the products of mass culture. Take the movie genre of Westerns as an example. Each one presents its own story an duses a narrative style of its own, which prevents us confusing the Wil dWest a dventures tol dby John For dwith those filmed by Sergio Leone. An dyet, after watching no more than a dozen films of the genre, each new Western will leave us with a sense of d ́ej`avu as far as the general framework of the scenario is concerned. This is because, as a narrative form, the Western always resorts to the same basic pattern, which, for all its invariability, leaves the fiel dopen to a host of permuta- tions, within certain limits. The model is simple. First comes an agreed list of classic characters: the law upholder, his inexperienced auxiliary, the outlaw, the sheriff, the local despot corrupting the town, the citizens – respectable but frightene d– a barman behin dhis counter an dthe in- evitable saloon girl.

Such are the ingredients that can be use dto concoct a story of the Wil dWest, in which invention an d dramatic art are mere seasonings, pleasant but not absolutely necessary to make the dish palatable. This comparison of hominisation scenarios with Westerns is not merely a jest. Underlying these two genres (and a host of others), we fin da similar type of generative pattern. ‘Human’ characteristics are the ingredients of the hominisation scenario, just as the sheriff and the out- law are of the Western, an dwe can bring them together in a list, in which stereotype dpositions mark the ‘principal roles’, such as bipedalism , tools or free hands , an dthe place of the secon dary characters, such as prolonged infancy or disappearance of oestrus (Table  ). The whole of these relations, which are frequently put to use an dwhich establish the connections be- tween these characteristics, is just as schematic (from now on I shall call them simply ‘relations’, but we must remember that these scenarios give them a causal status).

The traditional rhetoric of the human sciences, on which our scenarios draw, gives their content a rather blurred form of expres- sion: scraps of facts merge with methodological statements, inferences lie beside a display of erudition, ideological confessions are mingled with statistical data. The texts, often unduly lengthy – as custom demands – form a coherent whole only from the standpoint of the constraints of the rhetoric. This presentation does not facilitate analysis of the logical struc- ture of the texts. So the first task consiste din giving a clearer form to the content of the scenarios, so as to express their basic logical articulations. I have therefore subjecte dthem to a rewriting in accor dance with the principles of logicist analysis developed by Jean-Claude Gardin.  The logicist analysis consists in envisaging the text as a construction, the skeleton of which is lai dout between a starting point an dan arrival point. The analyst tries, first of all, to identify in the text all the initial propositions, that is to say, those with no explicit antecedents in the au- thor’sargumentation,an danassemblageofterminalpropositions,which themselves give rise to no subsequent inference in the construction. The next stage aims to reconstruct the chain of intermediary propositions which establish a bridge between the starting and arrival points, the intermediary propositions being linked together by operations of infer- ence. Thus the logicist reconstruction allows a long text, full of rhetoric, to be transforme dinto a series of derivations in the form of operations of the type ‘if a , then b ’. This form of representation is enormously helpful in studying the representations that lie at the basis of the explanations advanced in the hominisation scenarios. The long labour of analysis to which each of these scenarios an dits results has been submitte dwill not be relate din detail here.  I will rather concentrate my attention on the rules of infer- ence that appear most frequently in these works, a recurrence of which indicates a widely shared confidence in their validity.

All the explanatory relations observe din our twenty-four scenarios can be reduced to  simple binary sequences of the type ‘if x then y ’. Since these bring a total of forty-one elements into play, it is easy to calculate the number of possible binary permutations, equal to  (n(n −  )) sequences, that is to say almost twelve times as many as the number which actually turn up in the analyse dtexts. The difference mightbeexplained,atleastinpart,bythefactthatourchoiceofscenarios is very limited; it is unlikely that twenty-four texts could exhaust all the possibilities for combinations that might be made from the underlying conceptual matrix. However, certain indications suggest that a portion of these relations has been deliberately discarded a priori , while others, for reasons that require an explanation, enjoy a considerable success. Certain elements are thus ascribe dgreat explanatory power, which coul d be measure dby the number of ‘human’ properties of which they are deemed to explain the origin: for example, tools play a part in generating some twenty characteristics, whereas disappearance of oestrus explains only one.

These explanations, of which there are twenty-one, drawn from all our texts, are interlinke dan dcan be represente din the form of a synthetic scheme (Fig.  ), which defines the cardinal axes along which the hominisation scenarios can be generated. For the majority of them, a change in the natural environment func- tions as the prime mover that triggers the process of hominisation (see the next chapter). From there, three main pathways mark the beginning of the divergences between the scenarios and lay the foundations of part of their variety (Table  ). Depending on the importance the authors attach to anatomy, technology an dsubsistence activities, change in the environment is thought to lead sometimes to the adoption of bipedalism, sometimes to the origin of tools, sometimes to the transition to a hunting subsistence. Then, each of these three initial characteristics (bipedalism, tools, hunting) serves to set a whole ‘causal’ chain in motion. If our ancestors adopted an upright posture, their hands were freed from loco- motion; the free hand made it possible to produce and use tools; the tools replace dthe canines in a great many functions an dconsequently the ca- nines were reduced in size; learning to make tools required a complex means of communication, so language was created, and so on. When an author favours the view that it was hunting that playe da decisive role in anthropogenesis, we see the explanations evolve in a different direc- tion: hunting implies sexual division of labour which means the division of economic tasks between the two sexes; that establishes the custom of food-sharing and duties of reciprocity; thus the germ of social life is formed; a social existence gives rise to the need for communication, immediately generating language; the use of words enables the mental faculties to blossom; they, in turn, lea dthe early humans to perfect their culture, etc. Whichever path is followed, the network of conventional relations al- lows some fifteen chief ‘human’ characteristics to be ‘explained’ at the en dof the operation.

Since I shall frequently make use of texts from the past, samples of which stretch from Antiquity to our own times, the reader might suspect that the author’s intention is to prove insidiously that in palaeoanthro- pology there is ‘nothing new under the sun’, and that the reflection of specialists on the origins of humanity have hardly evolved over cen- turies.

The observation that there are historical continuities in this domain is not a conclusion that would ensue from my analyses, but actually an empirical observation that gave rise to them, their starting point rather than their en dresult.

It may be, still according to the same view, that certain ideas pass from one context to another, but that woul dbe possible only for i deas possesse dof such firm empiri- cal foundations that even a change of paradigm is incapable of casting doubt on them.

At a perio d, the precise dating of which varies from one text to another depending on the data of the moment, a great drought ravaged East Africa, bringing in its train the replacement of tropical forest by open savannah, thereby  The idea of environmental change is absent from Lamarck (  ), Engels (  /  ) and Leroi-Gourhan (  ). Only Glynn Isaac (  a,  b), of all the authors of the texts analysed, emphasise dthat an ecological crisis, although plausible, is not really necessary from a theoretical point of view in order to explain hominisation. Indeed, the theory of evolution, especially in its Darwinian version, allows the transformations of the species to be conceive das a process that may at times be independent of environmental change.  Palaeoanthropological scenarios describe our ancestors’ new environment as having a remark- ably standardised assemblage of attributes. These can be divided into three groups: (a) Negatives: drought, absence of vegetable food, shortage of water and food in general, attacks by predators, competition from carnivores, ecological factors inducing mortality. (b) Positives: abundance of game, abundance of food, diversity and density of game species, absence of predators. (c) Neutrals: savannah, open country, patchy environment, ecological change. More than half the scenarios (  out of  ) ascribe negative properties to the new environment of the Hominidae, two give it positive features (Hill  ; Kelso an dQuiatt  ), one text uses both simultaneously (Tanner an dZihlman  ), while only two mention only neutral attributes (Lumsden and Wilson  ; Kurlan dan dBeckerman  ).

The forests, rich in plant resources (especially fruit), gave way – according to the majority of our scenarios – to an ari dsavannah teeming with car- nivores, from which flight into the trees was impossible, since there were no more trees around. As a consequence, our forebears are believed to have entere don a difficult perio dof ecological crisis. In or der to survive, they ha dto take up nature’s challenge an daban don an ancient way of life that allowe dthem to satisfy their nee ds in the hospitable milieu of the forest, but that prove duseless in the hostile savannah.

This is how, in the struggle against a hostile environment, the first hominids would have laboriously moulded their nature. Is this view the fruit of empirical data? Admittedly, climatic changes of the Plio-Pleistocene in East Africa, marke din the long term by an expansion of open environments at the expense of tree cover, seem to be well attested.  On the other hand, we cannot say the same for the vision of a sharp transition from forest to savannah, nor for the actual image of the savannah, painted in such dark terms. Indeed, the zones of covered environment (forests, savannah woodland) and the open zones (shrub savannah, grass savannah) ha dalways coexiste din the lan dscape of the period, and it was only their proportions that were subject to changes. The climatic variations of the Plio-Pleistocene in East Africa consisted of cool periods, accompanied by a reduced rainfall and expansion of the open environments, alternating with periods of warm, dry climate, marke dby an expansion of the tree cover.   E.g. texts assemble din Coppens  .  E.g.

Since the first French edition of this book in  , new data have strongly supported my doubts about the habitual view of climatic change in East Africa during the late Miocene, while weakening the climate-change theory of hominisation. First, analysis of carbon residues in ancient soils of the Rift Valley in Kenya have indicated that a heterogeneous environment, in which open savannahs existed alongside denser vegetation, had dominated in this region of Africa for  million years, with the first traces of drying out dating from  million years ago (Kingston, Marino an dHill  ). Second, more exhaustive studies of climate change, as revealed in deep-sea cores, made it possible to demonstrate that these bear no correlation to the dates for the emergence of the successive taxons of Hominidae (Foley  ).

Likewise, it is not certain tha t the move from life in the forest to life on the savannah must systematically imply a greater threat from predators. Since the authors of the scenarios often claim to construct the image of the savannah on the basis of present-day ecological analogies, let us re- member that, today, a leopard ( Pantheraparadus ) in the forest can be just as dangerous as a lion in the savannah.  Moreover, in neither environment does this danger seem to be the main threat to primates. Chimpanzees living in the trees are not excessively worrie dby leopar ds;  in the event of a chance encounter on the same branch, a solitary chimpanzee is usually capable of intimidating the predator and seeing it off.  Nor does the threat from carnivores appear to be troublesome in an open environ- ment: observations of chimpanzees for forty-four months in the national park of Niokolo Koba (Senegal), where forests constitute only  per cent of the plant cover, have reveale dnot a single case of aggression by carni- vores like lions, leopards, hyenas or wild dogs, yet all these are present in the region.  Adrian Kortland, who took the trouble to review a consi- derable literature on the great apes of Africa in order to find confirmation of the ever-present threat to primates from predators, encountered only one case of the death of an ape at the claws of an attacker.  One can, Valley, reminds us of the continuing uncertainty surrounding the designation of the cradle of the homini ds, too hastily associate dwith a region where it is hope dto fin dtraces of an appropriate climatic crisis which woul dhave coinci de dwith the key moment of anthropogenesis (Brunet et al.  ).  Hamilton an dCurt  .  Pianka  : table  .  ; Hart an dHart  .  Brain  :  –  ; Clark  .  Tutin, McGrew an dBal dwin  .  Bandini and Baldwin  .  Tutin, McGrew an dBal dwin  .  Kortland  :  ; see also Goodall  :  –  ."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Anthropogenesis and science  of course, reply that today’s primates offer a very poor analogy with the situation of our ancestors, who live din a somewhat different environ- ment, where the carnivores known today were accompanied by extinct Felidae like Dinofelis , Homoterium , Pantera speleus , Actionyx an dtwo species of Hyenidae .  Consequently, this greater diversity and concentration of carnivore population may have been reflecte din greater pre dation pres- sure.

A goo dmany of the scientific scenarios seem to accept this model. The earliest of those works, such as Cl ́ emence Royer’s book, explicitly call period A ‘the Edenic age’ or the ‘golden age’.  In the more recent scenarios, the tropical forest, with its amazing abundance, absence of predators and the vegetarian diet of its inhabitants, is en- dowed with paradisal attributes. The savannah, with its lack of sufficient food, which made it necessary to hunt and therefore to kill, with all the predators thirsty for human blood that teem in it, becomes a new avatar of the Cursed Ground. For Robert Ardrey, who believed (as the subtitle of his book indicates) that he was proposing a ‘personal hypothesis’, this dual identification becomes quite deliberate, and the author compares life in the Miocene forests with a paradisal existence (‘every indication of science points to Miocene Kenya as the Eden of the human stock ’), while speaking of the advent of ‘the terrible Pliocene’ as the expulsion from paradise.  The majority of anthropologists have refuse dto acknowl- edge any scientific value in Ardrey’s speculations; but it is worth noting that his view of the ecological transformation seems ‘personal’ more for the excesses of his flori dstyle than for its content.

While preserving its principal idea of the close relationship between the extent of human progress an dthe magni- tude of the obstacles to be faced, Darwin’s chief innovation on that point is to dissociate progress from the struggle against a hostile nature alone an dassociate it equally an dabove all with the struggle an dcompetition against fellow creatures, in the process of natural selection.  The au- thors of most of the scenarios have not considered it necessary to make use of Darwin’s innovation an dpreferre dto remain faithful to the ol d idea of the hostility of original nature. Development, for conjectural anthropology, is simply the outcome of afflictions, distresses and perils; thus the absence of cataclysms becomes synonymous with stagnation.

For Virgil, the Golden Age ends with the intervention of Jupiter, who orders humans to brave a hostile nature and create the ‘crafts’. According to the conjectures of naturalists of the late eighteenth an dearly nineteenth centuries, culture appears when the proliferation of species destroys the harmony of original existence and obliges humans to mobilise their forces in a struggle for increasingly scarce resources. In a goo dmany of our scenarios, it is climatic change that transforms a fertile andhospitableforestintoathreateningsavannah,whereculturebecomes indispensable for our forebears. Throughout these transformations, the ‘two epochs’ model keeps its habitual place, and the same goes for the attributes ascribe dto it, base dinvariably on pairs of opposites such as: ‘abundance of food/shortage of food’, ‘threat of predators/absence of predators’, ‘peaceful existence/struggle for survival’, etc. A few scenarios have shaken off this vision of the transition from friendly nature to hostile nature. Two of the texts analysed present the new savannah environment of the hominids as a habitat without threat from predators, and with an abundance of game and all kinds of food  (Table  ). The American anthropologist Kim Hill gives to this picture the status of a hypothesis, without trying to test it against data or at least imagining a possibility of some empirical verification.  J. Kelso an dD.

However, the validity of this argument by analogy has not been teste dwith palaeoecological data. What is more, the claim of no threat from predators is put in question by the traces of predation on certain fossil bones of Hominidae.  These inconsistencies shoul dnot be too surprising: this new image of the savannah is incoherent only from an empirical point of view, while its form matches up well to the rules of transformation typical of na ̈ ıve anthropology.

The mere inversion of periods A and B does not, even so, change the principle of the explanation. In the traditional version, it is the hostile environ- ment that forces our ancestors into an activity that ends in the great transformation. The environment fashions the human being; it alone determines his behaviour. This role of the environment is preserved in the new version, which in fact corrects only the view of human nature. The latter is conceive din line with the premises of Optimal Foraging Theory, very fashionable with certain American anthropologists at the en dof the  s an dthe beginning of the  s. In conformity with the axioms of this theory, the principle of human behaviour is first and foremost the optimisation (even maximisation) of economic yield. Our ancestor, placed suddenly in a new environment with plentiful resources, abides by this universal law and acts like a model capitalist, adopting a new strategy to ensure greater economic efficiency.  As a consequence, the process of hominisation is launched. It is paradoxical that, while at- tributing abundant resources to the hominids’ milieu, K. Hill at the same time calls on Optimal Foraging Theory, the principles of which, by def- inition, apply only to situations where resources are scarce.  Thus the premises of an ecological theory with a restricte d domain of application are misrepresente das ‘universal laws’ vali dat all times an din all places.

The justifications of causal relations, moreover, are as stereotyped as the relations themselves and most often take the form of extreme gen- eralisations. To come back to our example, the thesis in which hunting always implies a sexual division of labour (hunting masculine and gath- ering feminine) is frequently founded on the following premises: (a) Hunting requires great mobility and great strength.

When looking for the historical antecedents of propositions devoid of empirical foundations, I shall not operate like the historians, who are often concerned with retracing the vicissitudes of the ideas and then reconstructing their emergence, metamorphoses and ‘social con- text’. This analysis of the scenarios of anthropogenesis will not be a scenario of the genesis of ideas. My task is quite different: it is to deter- mine whether the success of persistent ideas in scholarly anthropology is better explained by their empirical and logical foundations, or rather by their conformity with the long-term structures of common-sense anthropology. FROM ECOLOGICAL CHANGE TO HUNTING The causal relation ‘ecological change → hunting’ occurs in eight scenarios.  In order to portray our ancestors’ environment, seven of them resort to the vision of ‘hostile nature’ while only one  uses the im- age of ‘edenic nature’.

The hypothesis of original vegetarianism had been based largely on analogies with modern primates, who were formerly believed not to eat flesh.

Later philosophical specula- tion has picked up the same sequence of events, while adding materialist significance. Naturalists like Delam ́ etherie  or Virey  placed the first humans in ‘a fair land’ where gathering easily sufficed to satisfy all their needs; it was population growth that would force our ancestors later to supplement their diet with meat. These notions foreshadow the view we find in our palaeoanthropo- logical scenarios: the peaceab le vegetarians are obliged, by an event that comes along to disturb the balance of their habitat, to hunt and kill. This conceptual infrastructure remains invariable, hypotheses competing to find naturalist explanations, illustrated by a few data chosen at random, that agree with the mythical theme of a transition from original vegetar- ianism to the cruel hunt. So new ecological data on the Plio-Pleistocene environment, cited today by scientific scenarios, merely provide some minor accessories to make the old mythical theme more credible. Anthropologist Kim Hill  differs from other authors by attributing paradisal features to the hominids’ new milieu: abundance of animal re- sources and absence of predators. In these conditions, the author asserts, hunting made it possible to maximise yields from efforts invested in pro- visioning, so that ecological change drove our ancestors, as unrepentant maximisers, to become hunters. I have stated my reservations concerning that particular ecological view and the use of Optimal Foraging Theory by this author. I must now add that Hill’s argument, with its ‘new’ image of the environment, is limited to reversing the chronological positions of ‘mother nature’ and ‘stepmother nature’, while maintaining the traditional sequences of the shift from vegetarianism to meat eating and from gathering to hunting. How changes in the way of life and of feeding are explained also re- main the same: just as shortage of food in a hostile environment forced humans to become hunters, so abundance in a hospitable environment obliges them now to start living by hunting. So, whatever the environ- ment, its impact on our ancestors is the same, and the logic of ecological determinism remains safe.  Delam ́ etherie  :  .  Virey,  , I :  .  Hill  ."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"In search of causes  FROM ECOLOGICAL CHANGE TO BIPEDALISM No fewer than twenty-one scenarios in my sample consider bipedalism to be a distinctive characteristic of human species; the best illustration of its significance in scenarios of hominisation is that bipedal locomotion becomes sufficient in itself to explain the origin of eight other important ‘human’ characteristics. Speculations about upright posture have a long history. When Plato spoke of the vertical posture of man, he said that the head, being the seat of the most noble of souls, has to be turned upwards as evidence that the human being is ‘the heavenly plant’, and as a sign of his ‘affin- ity with heaven’.  This symbolic use of high and low, of vertical and horizontal positions, which serves to connote the distinction between humans and animals, occurs also in Xenophon,  Aristotle,  Pliny  and Vitruvius.  Ovid returns to it by developing its allegorical mean- ing: man was allowed to be upright and to turn his face up so that he might gaze at the sky.  Cicero declares that only man adopts the vertical posture, so that by contemplating the heavens he may come to know the gods.  This tradition was perpetuated by Christian authors. Prudentius has God speak in these terms: ‘I had created man perfect and I had com- manded him to gaze on heavenly things, turned towards me in all his senses, to hold himself erect, to stand upright, to look upwards.’  For Gregory of Nyssa, the vertical attitude is the sign of the royal power of humans over all the other creatures, bent earthwards.  The same terms still appear at the beginning of the nineteenth century, although then they seem to be no more than vague metaphors, whose origi- nal significance has already been lost to an ornamental function; thus the naturalist J.-J. Virey is echoing the Ancients when he says that ‘the human brow is raised heavenwards’,  soon followed by Lamarck, for whom ‘humans endeavoured to stand upright, moved by the need to dominate’.   Plato  :  a.  Xenophon  : I .

To illustrate how this symbolic system functions, remember the biblical story of King Nebuchadnezzar, related in the Book of Daniel ( IV .  –  ). The proud monarch, driven from men, dwelled a long time with the beasts of the field and ended up resembling them and taking on different animal traits, among them, as the text suggests and me- dieval iconography depicts,  the horizontal posture on all fours. But Nebuchadnezzar regained the human condition when he was able to stand upright again and lift up his eyes unto heaven. It is in this symbolic sense that ‘upright posture/bipedalism’ creates humans, by turning them towards the heavens, whence they draw the strength necessary to rise above the animal state. That said, there is no reason to underestimate the criteria of upright posture and bipedalism, whichindeedarefairlyrarepropertiesoutsideourbiologicalfamily.This fact has not only been noted in the West: the ethnologist J.-P. Chaumeil reports that among the Amazonian Yagua, the criterion of ‘verticality’ of the species, expressed by the verb uriane (to ‘get up’, ‘stand up’, ‘be standing on one’s feet’, as opposed to the ‘crawling’ position) is used to distinguishthehigherfromtheloweranimalsandindicatestheirgradual climb towards humanity.  The fact remains that, while recognising the importance of this criterion, we should not forget its symbolic signifi- cance.

Nevertheless, schol- arly thought, following a symbolic tradition, continued to endow it with a strange ‘creative’ power: not only does upright posture distinguish humans from animals but it also produces humans out of animals, set- ting the hominisation process in motion almost single-handedly. Like Nebuchadnezzar, our ancestors only had to stand up on their feet to be transformed into human creatures. We now know that bipedalism appeared very early (Kanapoi, c .  mil- lion years ago; Laetoli,  .  million years ago), preceding a good many other ‘human attributes’, which may be an indication of the importance of its role in the hominisation process. But the way we see that role re- mains curiously faithful to the slant of the traditional imagery that still conditions the arguments of palaeoanthropologists. Let us return to our main subject. An environment change would have been the principal reason for adopting an upright posture and bipedalism. Four scenarios  suggest a simple causal relationship that can be reduced to the following syllogism: If at a certain period hominids started living in an open environ- ment, andif bipedal locomotion is linked with life in the open environ- ment, then thehominidsadoptedbipedallocomotionbecausetheyfound themselves in an open environment.

Robert Ardrey assumes that bipedalism would have favoured survival in the savannah, where our ancestors would have been living with the constant menace of predators.  Tanner and Zihlman’s scenario  postulates that bipedalism was adopted by the first hominids because it was useful when carrying food back to group base sites concealed in safer clusters of trees, where the hominids took cover from predators. This hypothesis is plausible but would require empirical validation, which has not been attempted and seems difficult to imagine. It is significant that all our authors try to explain the origin of bipedal- ism by looking for its ‘usefulness’, conceived in accordance with the traditional image they have of the natural environment, teeming with predators. Speculation about conceivable ‘usefulness’, when spared the imperative of validation, can evolve fairly freely and become a thought experiment, where more or less plausible conjectures rub shoulders at times with somewhat unexpected ideas. Thus R. W. Westcott believed that bipedalism was adopted because humankind’s ancestor stood up on twofeetsoastoseemtallerandsoimpresshisadversaries.  Accordingto A.

But recent observations by primatologistsundermineourhabitofattributingthetooltohumansand refusing it to animals. It turns out that chimpanzees and orang-utans not only use tools but actually make them.  What is more, the degree of complexity of these tools has moved certain anthropologists to compare them to the artefacts of some human groups.  When embarking on parallels of this type, the tendency to push them too far must, of course, be avoided and the disparities between the products of primates and those of the least advanced human groups remain beyond dispute;  but resemblancesexistandtheyareindicationsthatarigidbinaryopposition can give only a perfunctory and imperfect picture of differences, which are none the less real.  Robinson  :  .  Beck  ; Boesch and Boesch  ; Galdikas  ; Goodall  ; Jones and Sabater  ; Jordan  ;KortlandtandHolzhaus  ;Lethmate  ;McGrew  ;NishidaandHiraiwa  ; Struhsaker and Hunkeler  .

The scenarios usually speak of natural, unshaped stones and all kinds of sticks: Royer stones/branches of trees Darwin stones/clubs Coon stones/sticks Niestourkh stones/branches Washburn stones/sticks Ardrey stones/bludgeons Wolpoff stones/sticks The use of unshaped stones and of sticks would have marked the first stage in recourse to tools, even though it is only a matter of fortuitous tools, unprepared and eminently ‘natural’. The term ‘tools’, moreover, is a rather poor one to describe them, since our scenarios make them more like weapons, conforming to the traditional view which sees defence and fighting as the first needs and occupations of our ancestors. And yet the example of the chimpanzees should inspire more peaceable conjectures: ancient tools may have served to crack nuts rather than heads.  It is only recently that less bloodthirsty hypotheses have been put forward, abandoning the patterns of conjectural anthropology to draw nearer to what is suggested by the tools of present-day non-human primates.  But the fact that chimpanzees occasionally make use of stones and branches does not necessarily mean that these were the first tools of pre- historic hominids. There is not much likelihood that these hypotheses, based on analogies with present-day primates, will ever receive direct confirmation; it would need exceptional conditions (for example the transport of raw materials far from their naturally occurring deposits) for the prehistorian to be able to distinguish stones that have never found their way into the hands of hominids from those they might have occa- sionally used. Such discrimination is even less probable in the case of the occasional use of branches of trees, even supposing that some might be found one day on a hominid site. Note too, that the idea of making stones the first human weapons does not come originally from the observation of primates.

For a very long time, the club has faithfully accompanied early humans, and popular literature offers such lyrical descriptions of that union that I cannot resist the temptation to quote at least one of them: The club had thus been his first companion. He loved it. It flattered him. He was proud of it ... . At the moment of going into battle, he held it tight in his fist, as one holds the hand of a friend ... after the battle, he caressed it just as the huntsman strokes his dog’s back to show his appreciation; it was almost like thanks; the harder it had struck, the more esteem, attachment, trust and perhaps even gratitude he felt for it. He left it neither for food nor sleep; when it was not in his hand during a pause, it lay at his side, within reach; while he slept in the tree, he kept it on his chest.  To arm the hand of primitive man with a club seems perfectly natural to us, but we can find no trace of it in museum cases or in archaeological archives. The club is just not there. On the other hand, it has a very lively existence in the realm of the imaginary. Naturalists of the early nineteenth century,  as well as philosophers of the Enlightenment, fre- quently alluded to it.  But its birth certificate carries an earlier date, for the club or stick was already in the hands of the Wild Man – a charac- ter of medieval European folklore.  The historian Robert Bernheimer introduces us to this creature in the following terms: It is a hairy man, curiously compounded of human and animal traits, with- out, however, sinking to the level of an ape. It exhibits upon his naked human anatomy a growth of fur, leaving bare only its face, feet and hands, at times its knees and elbows, or the breasts of the female of the species. Frequently the creature is shown wielding a heavy club or mace, or the trunk of a tree.  The Wild Man is encountered in French Arthurian romances and in thesongsoftheGermanminstrels,andlaterstill,inMigueldeCervantes or Edmund Spenser.  But this character is not only found in books. During the famous Bal des Ardents in  at the court of Charles VI, the banquet ended with the death of several lords, whose disguises of rough cloth covered with linen hairs caught fire; the unfortunate victims were wearing Wild Man masks and we can see them in an engraving of the period in costumes on which linen hairs imitated animal fur; great clubs  Lucretius  :  , V .  –  .  Haraucourt  /  :  –  .  E.g.

As far as Antiquity is concerned, we are reduced to conjecture, but with regard to the natu- ralist speculation of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, it is easy to find textual proofs of these borrowings.

So ex- otic savages emerge, also covered in hair, ceaselessly at war with wild beasts and using clubs.  These images fell on the fertile soil of ancient representations and were propagated with amazing success, despite the refutations of this ‘common opinion’, made from the middle of the six- teenth century on by certain travellers.  But the inertia of the imaginary is too great for proofs of its inadequacy to oust clich ́ es very swiftly. To ensure that exotic peoples conformed to the model of the Wild Man, they were endowed with animal characteristics; the reverse pro- cedure served to project the same image on to orang-utans in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,  the only difference being that this time it was not a human being cast in the role of an animal but an animal in that of a human. Why did European imagination identify so completely our ances- tors, aborigines and orang-utans with this strange figure from mythical iconography and carnival rites? As I have already noted, the Wild Man represents a mixture of human and animal traits. Although nearly hu- man, the creature remains half beast, no longer wholly animal, but still lacking what is essentially human; the genuine ‘missing link’ in the nat- ural order, which, as was said, non facit saltum . Le Brun wrote: ‘all bodies are linked in the chain of Being; Nature everywhere is preceded and followed. In the constant order, her developing steps never conquer in leaps and bounds.

Compared to the Wild Man, all these ‘savage’ figures, whether ‘animalised’ humans or ‘humanised’ animals, inherited his attributes, and, oddly enough, the club. In time, as journeys to the Antipodesbecamemorefrequent,andobservationof ‘primitive’peoples and primates allowed Europeans to build up a more relevant body of knowledge about these contemporary incarnations of the Wild Man, the vision of clubs, fights with wild beasts and ‘bestial’ properties suffered a processoferosion,aslongasitwasslow.Ontheotherhand,inprehistoric archaeology, where verification of old beliefs is always more difficult, the Wild Man found his most secure refuge.

The aim of this long digression was to show how the weapon of an imaginary figure could have found a place in the hominisation scenarios. Let us move on now to analyse the causal relation that associates the origin of tools with ecological change. We find this sequence in five scenarios, four of which offer arguments that can be reduced to the following two inferences:   .

If (c) ibid ., andif (d) tools can replace the somatic organs of defence, then (e) to survive in their new hostile milieu, the hominids were obliged to resort to the use of tools.

Proposition ( b ) expresses the idea of human weakness, and those that follow (c–d–e) reconstitute the old conception of technique as a substitute for the teeth and claws that humans lack. This explanation is theoretically plausible and we cannot rule out the possibility that such was indeed the genesis of tools. But the essence of the problem stems from the fact that the hypothesis lacks empirical weight: it has never been confronted with palaeoanthropolog- ical or archaeological data and, indeed, it is difficult to imagine how it could be. At the same time, it would be wrong to believe that the attachment to this explanation stems from the fact that it is the only one conceivable. Na ̈ ıve anthropology claims that culture is born of practical necessities imposedbyahostilenature;butwhentheseclich ́ esareremoved,theycan easilybereplacedbyotherconjectures,someofwhichmaybeinspiredby observation of present-day primates. The research of M. A. Huffman,  who has described the use of stones in a group of macaques ( Macaca fuscata ), provides one of several examples: at the end of the year  , a macaque invented a game with stones, which consisted of picking up pebbles, piling them up, taking them in its hands and putting them down again on the ground, moving them from one place to another and finally rubbing or striking them against each other. Although these operations were linked to no practical needs, still less to any survival imperatives,the‘invention’wasagreatsuccess.In  ,fiveyearsafterits first appearance, the game was being played by  per cent of the group, which then numbered  individuals. The author of these observations makes an interesting comment: once the game was over, the macaque abandoned the stones, but his interest revived as soon as he saw ‘his’ stones in the hands of another monkey. This behaviour is well known to all who have observed children playing (or who are able to observe the world of adults, while keeping slightly aloof): the most ordinary toy can become a desirable object for no other reason than that someone else possesses it, or is trying to appropriate it. It is worth emphasising the social nature of the stimulus that is capable of fostering behaviour of no direct link to the basic physiological needs. In primates, play constitutes an important, though often underestimated element in the use of tools.  Moregenerally,laboratoryresearchindicatesthatplayhasaconsiderable role in the life of social animals.  Such data as these allow us to imagine that the first tools might have appeared as the secondary outcome of  Huffman  .  Menzel  .  Quoted from Bekoff  :  ."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"  Explaining human origins a playful activity, and that they were propagated thanks to a system of social motivations, independently of any practical use.

And yet only one of the two is commonly accepted, and confidence is generally reserved for the one that is in perfect harmony with the notions of na ̈ ıve anthropology. Thetraditionthatassociatestheoriginoftechniquewithhumanweak- ness and the constraints of survival is very ancient. We find its first trace in Protagoras ’ narrative of human creation: Once upon a time there were gods only, and no mortal creatures.

Epimetheus said to Prometheus: ‘Let me distribute and do you inspect.’ This was agreed, and Epimetheus made the distribution. There were some to whom he gave strength without swiftness, while he equipped the weaker with swiftness; some he armed, other s he left unarmed; and devised for the latter some other means of preservation. Upon those whom he clothed in diminutive bodies, he bestowed winged flight or subterranean habitations: thosewhichheaggrandisedwithmagnitude,heprotectedbytheirverysize:and similarly with the rest of his distribution, always compensating. These devices he used as precautions that no race should be destroyed. And when he had provided against their destruction by one another, he contrived also a means of protectingthemagainsttheseasonsofheaven;clothingthemwithclosehairand thick skins sufficient to defend them against the winter cold, yet able to resist the summer heat, and serving also as a natural bed of their own when they wanted to rest; also he furnished them with hoofs and hair and hard callous skins under their feet ...

As for tools, human weakness is even considered to be a sufficient condition for theirappearance,inconjunctionwith‘ecologicalchange’,andyetamong animals there is no lack of creatures more ‘disarmed’ and more ‘threat- ened’, which nevertheless do not resort to clubs to defend themselves.  Gregory of Nyssa  :  .  Ibid. :  –  .  Origen  , IV .  .  Royer  :  .  Niestourkh  :  , see also Ardrey  /  :  –  .  Royer  :  ,  ,  ; Darwin  , I :  –  ; Oakley  :  ; Coon  /  :  –  ; Niestourkh  :  ; Ardrey  /  :  –  ; Wolpoff  :  .  Lamarck  :  ; Hockett and Ascher  :  ; Ruyle  :  ."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" Explaining human origins One of the five scenarios that envisage a causal relation between change of milieu and the appearance of tools offers a new explanation.  Thefirstartefactsofourancestors,itsays,wouldnothavebeenweapons, but a kind of baby sling, digging sticks and food containers, useful for gathering. It puts forward the ad hoc hypothesis of an incontrovertible need for such objects, and for good reason: it is directly connected to the premises of a feminist theory – which makes no secret of its ideological commitment – through a determination to ‘prove’ the primordial role of womeninthehominisationprocess.Protectionofchildrenandgathering areattributedtofemales,andtheauthorsofthescenarioassertthatitwas these feminine occupations that inspired the invention of the first tools, which had become necessary in a new, more constraining environment in order to lighten the labour devolving on women. This conception is as unverifiable as the classic hypotheses, but it is often considered to be ‘new’ and ‘original’. Yet it hardly goes beyond the traditional pattern of na ̈ ıve anthropology. In fact it is built on the basis of a transformation of the previous explanation, which associated the first tools with ‘aggressive’ and typically ‘masculine’ occupations, such as fighting and hunting; as a consequence of this, women became the passive object of cultural changes forged in the travails and fatigues that only men, ‘the veritable creators of culture’, were capable of facing. The feminist anthropologists invert this thesis: it is women who lay the foundations of culture, while the males wait passively in the wings until their more advanced lady friends deign to ‘hominise’ them. In spite of this transposition, the mode of explanation remains classic: the women are deemed to start making tools under the pressure imposed, as usual, by a change of milieu. The metamorphosis of the canonical explanation is brought about by a new use of the traditional elements, subject to the minimal reworking essential to invert the respective roles and merits of the two sexes. FROM BIPEDALISM TO FREE HANDS AND TO TOOLS It is convenient to discuss these three elements together because in the scenarios they form a triad of almost inseparable characteristics that follow on from each other to form a pair of explanatory relations.

Virey, ‘which lifts our sightandoursensesabovetheground,whichleavesourhandsfree,those marvellous instruments, makers of the other instruments, gives our brain an extraordinary preponderance over that of all other beings and makes man, in the words of Plato, a celestial plant.’  Now, it had been known from the eighteenth century that neither bipedalism nor free hands are attributes reserved for human species alone, so they could not, consequently, provide an adequate explanation for the genesis of tools.  Moreover, even a limited bipedalism, mastered by some primate species, permits the use of tools.  The inadequacy of such an explanation becomes even clearer when we remember that hands can be freed not just by bipedalism but by sitting down; we should not forget that some  per cent of technical activities in so-called ‘prim- itive’ cultures are performed in a crouched or kneeling position.  So it would be just as conceivable that tools owed their origin not to bipedal- ism but to a seated position. On the other hand, if a free hand was a sufficient condition of the emergence of tools, one might ask why their use is so little developed among quadrumanous apes, for the seated posi- tion frees four hands in their case, which should doubly foster technical performances ...  Theseobjectionsmakenoclaimtoshowthattheexplanatorysequence ‘bipedalism → free hand → tools’ is wrong. It is more a case of under- lining in the first place that this relation is not the only one possible (for example, an alternative version is conceivable (‘seated position → free hand → tools’ ); in the second place, that its premises are inadequate.  Aristotle  :  ,  a–  a; Diodorus Siculus  :  ; Goguet  , I :  ; Kant  /  :  ; Vitruvius  :  , II .  .  E.g.

The relation ‘free hand → tools’, which has been holding its own in the conceptions of anthropogenesis since Antiquity, has undergone a very characteristic transformation in recent scenarios. Palaeoanthropol- ogists became aware that if bipedalism frees the hands from locomotion, the resulting consequences concern activities linked to locomotion more than to the use of tools in general. They immediately started to speculate about the benefits that free hands could have offered during locomo- tion: easier transport of tools, food or young, more efficient gathering or hunting, etc. The uses of the free hands are conceived in line with the idea the authors of the scenarios have of the activity that is crucial to hominisation. Formerly, when it was thought that the tool had created human species, a free hand was considered as the condition for tool use; nowadays, to the extent that an ‘anthropogenic’ function often comes down just to gathering,  or transporting food,  or even hunting,  the free hand becomes the condition for either gathering, transporting food or hunting. Thus bipedalism and free hands continue to hold the symbolic status of an essential condition for anthropogenesis that they already enjoyed in ancient conjectures. FROM TOOLS TO BIPEDALISM Nine of our scenarios assumed that bipedalism preceded the first tools and was their cause. Fewer of them reverse that relation, to assert that it was in fact the tools that had arrived before bipedalism and should therefore explain its genesis.  Does this new version get more support from the empirical data? Nothing is less certain, since the oldest indis- putable trace of bipedalism, at Laetoli in Tanzania (about  .  million years ago) comes before the oldest known tools (sites at Omo Shungura and Hadar Kada Gona  .  .  , in Ethiopia, dated respectively to  and  .  million years ago  ).

But this solution implies that the first hypothesis (tools → bipedalism) must be based on the second (tools of perishable materials) – which is plausible and not disproved, since absence of proof is not proof of absence – but is incapable of validation since it cannot be proved wrong. It is interesting to linger on the argument underlying the ‘tools → bipedalism’ relation. The primatologist Sherwood Washburn con fined himself to stating in general terms that the tool favoured bipedal locomotion.  Other authors are more explicit and try to give an idea of the mechanism that might have been at work in this process. If the tool was at the origin of bipedalism, they say, it was because only that mode of locomotion could free the hands which were indispensable for using tools  or for carrying and using them while walking.  The better to establish the sequence ‘tools → bipedalism’, two of the scenarios go further, accepting that bipedal locomotion is ineffective in itself and, as a consequence, its appearance must be linked to some other advantage,inthiscasetheusingoftools,whichinturnisdirectly favoured by natural selection. However, the existence of bipedal animals proves that the tool is not necessary for preserving this type of locomotion through the process of natural selection. Furthermore, the theory of the general energy inefficiency of bipedalism seems fragile since certain experiments show that walking on two feet may be more energy-efficient than walking on four.  So it is clear that the ‘tools → bipedalism’ relation is based on ad hoc arguments, of which some are incapable of validation and others have been disconfirmed, at least in a general form. This explanation is interesting because it has no antecedents in the speculation of na ̈ ıve anthropology. Of course, it does not thereby acquire a special heuristic value, but it has the advantage of illustrating a mechanism underpinning theconstructionofnewpalaeoanthropologicalexplanations.Weobserve  TothandWoods(  )commentthatourancestorscouldequallywellhavemade–besidestools of perishable materials like wood – retouched shell knives, shells being easily available along the lakeshoreswherethesitesoftheearliesthominidsareconcentrated.Toolsofthattypeareknown intheMesolithicandNeolithic(Vigie  ).ForthePlio-Pleistocenesites,thishypothesiscannot be verified at present: shells being fragile, it is impossible with current techniques to distinguish signs of retouching or wear from those due to fortuitous deterioration.  Washburn  :  .  Ruyle  :  .  Oakley  :  ; Hockett and Ascher  :  –  ; Wolpoff  :  .  Rodman and McHenry  ."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"In search of causes  that the new sequence ‘tools → need to have free hands → bipedalism’ isjustaninversionoftheclassictriad‘bipedalism → freehands → tools’. So we see that a new hypothesis is formed by inverting a traditional scheme, and without enriching or completing it with new elements. The procedure is suggestive of the interplay of images in a kaleidoscope, the functioning of which has already served Claude L ́ evi-Strauss as a metaphor to describe one of the typical procedures of ‘savage thought’: by shaking the apparatus we can obtain a variety of configurations, the diversity of which, impressive in the first instance, is in fact the result of combinations of a few bits and pieces that are always the same.  FROM THE USE OF TOOLS TO REDUCED CANINE TEETH When we try to define human characteristics by contrasting them with those of apes, reduced canines stand out as an important specific feature. In fact, man is a primate with very reduced canine teeth. Since there usedtobeatendencytocomparehumanswithanimalsingeneralrather than with apes, reduced canines only appeared quite late in the list of human properties, in the nineteenth century.  Although Gregory of Nyssa,  in the fourth century, was already deploring the fact that the first humans did not have powerful teeth to defend themselves against animals, this was just a routine reference to Plato’s dialogue Protagoras ,in which lack of strong teeth constitutes one point in the vast inventory of human weakness. Reduced canine teeth acquired the status of a human attribute much later. Charles Darwin was the first, as far as I have been able to ascertain, to associate reduction of canines in humans with the use of tools. So began the long history of an explanation that provides the curious and instructive example of an erroneous idea, the popularity of which was long resistant to counter-arguments, so that it is still perpetuated in cer- tain hominisation scenarios. Its analysis provides an opportunity for a better understanding of the strength of the traditional imagery, which is capable of prolonging the existence of notions that hardly fit both factual and theoretical constraints.  L ́evi-Strauss  :  .  E.g. Lawrence  /  :  . We should, however, add that several naturalists since the seventeenth century have observed that apes are endowed with longer canine teeth than hu- mans; nevertheless that observation has not led naturalists to make reduced canine teeth a distinctive character of human species; cf. for example, Perrault  :  ; Daubenton n.d.:  .  Gregory of Nyssa  :  ."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" Explaining human origins The relation ‘tools → reduced canine teeth’ appears in seven of our scenarios,  six of which offer the following argument:  . If (a) at a certain time in hominisation, man’s ancestor began to use tools, andif (b) from the very beginning, man’s ancestor was endowed with large canine teeth and used them as a weapon in fighting, then (c) the first tools replaced their canine teeth in fighting.  . If (c) ibid. , then (d) as a result of using the first tools, the canines of man’s ancestor were reduced. This last inference calls for comment: enigmatic in Carleton Coon’s scenario, it becomes clearer in the other texts, thanks to complementary premises formulated as follows: the disuse of parts [of the body] weakens them;  an organ that the organism does not need becomes reduced;  the take-over of the functions of canine teeth by tools favoured the reduction of the canine.  We recognise here the classic principles of Lamarckism. In J.-B. Lamarck’s Philosophie zoologique of  , they take the form of two ‘laws’, the content of which is worth remembering, for they contain ideas that play an important role in our scenarios: First law : ‘the more frequent and sustained use of any organ gradually strengthens that organ, develops it, makes it bigger and gives it a power proportional to the duration of that use; whereas lack of constant use of a given organ, weakens it imperceptibly, causes it to deteriorate, progres- sively diminishes its faculties and finally brings about its disappearance’. Second law : ‘everything nature has caused to be acquired or lost by an individual, through the influence ... of the predominant use of a given organ, or by that of the constant disuse of such a part, nature preserves in new individuals through heredity’.  In giving these principles the name of Lamarckism, I am respecting currentusage,butitmustberememberedthatLamarckwasnottheirau- thor and that his originality lay only in giving them a simple and explicit form and making systematic use of it.

Before being taken up by Lamarck, the principle of use and disuse appears, among others, in Virey, Delam ́ etherie and Erasmus Darwin.  But in the eighteenth century there are already countless traces of it in the works of the naturalists or philosophers, and Diderot made himself a mouthpiece for the common opinion when he wrote that ‘exercise strengthens all the members, just as lack of exercise obliterates them’.  Certain indications justify the idea that this popular conception took shape as a mistaken generalisation of observations concerning the phe- nomenon of so-called adaptability. This hypothesis is suggested not only by the passage from Diderot quoted above, but especially by the reflec- tions of the naturalist Jean-Claude Delam ́ etherie who, when seeking to justify the principle of use and disuse, offered this argumentation: ‘A run- nerhasveryconsiderablestrengthinhislegs;theirmusclesbecomelarger and stronger. The same holds good for the arms of a blacksmith. A sailor has keen eyesight; a musician’s ear is exceedingly sensitive; a gourmet has a very fine palate; the sense of smell of a perfumer is much keener. ’  The same reasoning would be taken up again later by Charles Darwin.  Thus the mechanism of adaptability, very real since that is what is responsible for the development of the impressive muscles of athletes, is credited with the ability to transform all organs profoundly and permanently . Centuries earlier, Plato introduced a similar idea in his metaphysical deliberations on souls, so formulating a sort of ‘spiritual Lamarckism’: ‘one part [of the soul], if remaining inactive and ceasing from its natural motion, must necessarily become very weak, but that which is trained and exercised, very strong’.  Use strengthens, disuse weakens, and both are capable of transforming organs, even spiritual ‘organs’ – that is the common basis of the different manifestations of the same notion, as ancient as it is widespread. Equally common was the conviction that acquired characteristics can be inherited (Lamarck’s second law).  Its roots go back into Antiquity, witness the corpus of Hippocratic writings.  Aristotle took a particular  Virey  , II :  ; Delam ́ etherie  : liv; E.

Moreover he was not the first or the last to notice them. And yet the popularity of the principle of the inheritance of acquired characteristics was hardly af- fected by them; it was not until Weismann’s research in the  s  that a serious challenge was offered. The crucial experiments, in this particu- lar case, took place in the  s, thanks to the development of molecular biology: they demonstrate that information acquired by proteins cannot bepassedbacktothenucleicacidsandsobetransmittedfromonegener- ation to another.  In spite of these decisive arguments, the Second Law has managed to maintain a certain credibility. The idea reappears in the doctrine of Lysenko who, it will be remembered, dominated Soviet bi- ology between  and  . Even in our own day, almost anywhere in the world, the public is happy to read articles that proclaim periodically in the popular press the inheritance of acquired characteristics ‘scientif- ically demonstrated’. Popular culture is not alone in bearing witness to the life force of Lamarckism, and some of our scenarios carry its mark, as late as the  s.  No one in anthropology today would dare to defend ‘Lamarckism’, at least not in the traditional form expressed in the two laws. Yet some students have attempted to safeguard the ‘tools → reduced canine teeth’ relation, by confining themselves to getting rid of its Lamarckian princi- ples. The anthropologists C. L. Brace and M. F. A. Montagu have tried to replace the disuse principle by that of natural selection: the take-over of the warlike function of canines by the first tools would have rendered these teeth useless by freeing them from selective pressure which, un- til then, had fostered their great size. Consequently stochastic processes would have come into play and a directed accumulation of random mutations would have led to a reduction of the canine teeth.  This ex- planation is dubious, for a directed accumulation of random mutations is highly improbable without some favourable pressure of natural selec- tion, and that is lacking in this argument. The flaw is so obvious that it is difficult to understand how it could have occurred. It should be noted that introducing positive selection would be tantamount to challenging  Aristotle, trans.

So these authors would rather come into conflict with the principles of the theory of evolution than give up situating tools, as custom would have it, on the cause side. This attitude derives from a step typical of the process of tinkering with concepts; it consists in constructing new hypotheses from old elements, fitting them together despite their dis- parate nature and in spite of incompatibility with the assigned function. The problems posed by recasting the old explanatory sequence are not restricted to a ‘Lamarckism’ that would have to be got rid of, and, incidentally, could not easily be replaced mechanically by a Darwinian formula. The traditional explanation was not only Lamarckian through and through but was linked to a simplistic view of nature, depicted as a bloodstained circus where all the creatures lead lives full of relentless struggle. In that setting, the great canine teeth could not fail to become a fearsome weapon in combat. Nevertheless, research on primates en- dowedwithlargecaninesshowsthattheyrarelyusedtheseteethindirect confrontations: although the canines constitute an important accessory in aggressive behaviour, they belong rather in the realm of a subtle com- bination of intimidatory ploys, threats and ritual acts. An analogy comes to mind, that of nuclear weapons, the significance of which lies less in use than in demonstration. Yet this simple dialectic escapes the na ̈ ıve anthropologist who remains attached to the old image of our early an- cestors engaged in ceaseless warfare and armed, in the absence of tools, with their teeth and nails. Were not Lucretius and, later, Leonardo da Vinci already saying that ‘arms of old were hands, nails and teeth’?  This tenacious view inevitably affected the first descriptions of exotic peoples whose existence was likened to that of ‘ancient men’. Thus, Sir Francis Drake declared that the inhabitants of certain islands in the South Seas had only claws to defend themselves, while Le Mere asserted that the natives of New Guinea ‘use their teeth as offensive weapons’.  So the traditional relation of ‘tools → reduced canine teeth’ brings the classic themes of conjectural anthropology into play, where the life of earlyhumansisassociatedwithstruggle,andcaninesareseensimplyasa weapon,justasthefirsttoolswere.Onthesepremises,atypeofhypothesis wasconstructed,ofwhichDarwinintroducedthescholarlyversionwhen trying to explain the reduction of canine teeth in humans.

Starting from these assumptions, the hypotheses are directed towards the classic explanation: teeth and nails, rendered useless by artefacts, tend to reduce as a result of disuse. Itseemsthattheonlywaytogetoutofthestraitjacketofthistraditional opinion is to reject en bloc the whole sequence of ‘tools → reduced canine teeth’,whichisbasedonacommon-senseviewthatpersistsinattributing the same function to each of them. Alternative solutions have already been proposed and we can find some examples in our scenarios.  Cer- tain authors mention selective pressure, which might have to do with a change of diet; indeed, teeth, even if they happen to be used as weapons on occasion, serve first and foremost for cutting and chewing food.  Another plausible explanation refers to sexual selection. It is known that canine teeth are a manifestation of sexual dimorphism in primates, those of the males being bigger than those of the females. This phe- nomenon is often interpreted as an effect of sexual selection linked with the competitive behaviour to which males are prone.  The reduction of the canine teeth in hominids might thus be the result of a more mod- erate sexual selection than in apes. It is intriguing to note that Darwin came very close to this explanation. The greater part of The Descent of Man is devoted precisely to the different manifestations of sexual selec- tion. When speaking of apes, Darwin stresses the absence of great canine teeth in females: for what reason, he asks, are they deprived of such a means of defence, if, indeed, the canines are used for defence?  And he concludes that their presence in males stems from sexual selection. Nevertheless, when Darwin ruminates on the reduction of the canine teeth in man’s ancestors, the old clich ́ es re-emerge under his pen: con- stant struggles, defence against enemies, fangs used as weapons, the first tools replacing them and the reduction of the useless organ as a result of disuse. It is amazing to see this great naturalist succumbing so easily to these commonplaces; proof that a critical mind and remarkable erudi- tion are not always sufficient to triumph over the influence of traditional imagery.  Leonardo da Vinci  , II :  .  Jolly  :  ; Tanner and Zihlman  :  –  ; Lovejoy  :  .  Cf.

Only Leroi-Gourhan  resisted this simplification; he was cautious enough to emphasise the role of the neurological basis of language, which could not have emerged from nothingness solely under the pressure of a need, had it not been preceded by the formation of different cortical structures essential to the use of words.  Leroi-Gourhan’s approach differs from that of the other scenarios, more eager to reduce the cause of emergent characteristics to a single factor. Generally, it is affirmed that the origin of language is due to tools, whichmadetheuseofwordsnecessary,oratleastveryuseful;iflanguage did not exist before tools, it was because verbal communication had little point at that stage. Following this logic, as long as there were no tools, there was nothing worthy of being expressed and transmitted in speech. Language being the means of communication appropriate to cultural activities, we are back to the classic theory in which the tool is the first manifestation of culture. This notion has its place in the frame of na ̈ ıve anthropology: the first humans had to devote all their time to satisfying a few elementary needs and they could only achieve that with tools, an essential condition for survival. So the first efforts of humans had to be directedtomakingtools,anditwasonlylaterthatourancestorswouldbe abletotakeupotherculturalactivities,suchaslanguagecommunication or social life. According to this view, it is imperative that tools precede and explain language in one way or another, while the main premise leaves the field open to speculation as to the mechanisms of that causal relation (proximity of cerebral centres, usefulness for learning, etc.). FROM LANGUAGE TO MENTAL FACULTIES Theideathattheuseofspeechledtothedevelopmentofmentalfaculties in our ancestors rests on the conviction that language is necessary for ex- ercising cognitive functions such as ‘thought’, ‘memory’ or ‘foresight’.  This idea often passes wholly unchallenged: it seems obvious, remarks F.

Many pieces of research, a portion of which was presented in the symposium eloquently entitled Thought without Language , show that complex cognitive processes can de- velop without speech.  Animals are capable of reasoning, of envisaging causal relations between phenomena and of acting accordingly.  But their cognitive capacities have limits. Experiments with chimpanzees learning a gesture language have proved particularly instructive: al- though they are able to assimilate and master a large vocabulary of several hundred words, chimpanzees lack the mental capacity necessary for combining words according to the rules of syntax that ensure the linear structure of the expression.  One can only conclude, without minimising the impact of language on thought, that the former does not constitute the source of all cognitive faculties but that it is rather a product of them. The tendency to treat language as an indispensable condition for the development of mental faculties in our ancestors is, on the other hand, in perfect harmony with one of the profound convictions of na ̈ ıve anthropology. Back in the eighteenth century, it was often thought that reasoncannotexistwithoutlanguageandthatonlyspeechcanleadtothe combination of ‘ideas’, and make ‘reasoning’ possible.  To prove that thought cannot exist without language, descriptions of ‘wild children’ were then invoked, like the ‘bear-man’ of Lithuania, who ‘so long as he wasdeprivedoftheuseofwordsandspeech ... displayednooperationof the understanding and showed no sign of reason’.  ‘Without language’, wrote Herder, ‘all the operations of our mind ... would never have taken place, the elaborate structure of our brain would have remained idle, the whole purpose of our Being unaccomplished, as the instances of men who have fallen among beasts sufficiently prove.’ Homo sapiens must first be homo loquens , for ‘language is the mark of our reason, by which alone it acquires and propagates forms’.  A portion of modern scenarios of hominisation shares this opinion, and the justifications that accompany it have their place in the line of  Lhermite  :  .  Weiskrantz  , cf. in particular Premack  , likewise Premack  .  Dunbar  , see also Griffin  ; Walker  .  Gardner and Gardner  ; Premack  .  Herder  /  –  :  ; cf. also Rousseau  /  :  ; Turgot  /  :  .  Wolf, Psychologia rationalis ,  ; quoted from Tinland  :  .  Herder  –  , trans.

FROM CULTURAL BEHAVIOUR TO INCREASED BRAIN SIZE It is convenient to discuss these kinds of causal relations together, since our scenarios attribute the development of brain size in our ancestors to different items of cultural behaviour, considered separately or together, such as tools, language, hunting or cooperation. The underlying reason- ing is the following: If hominids began to practise activities x , y , etc., andif activities x , y , etc. imply (cause, necessitate, entail, etc.) an increase in the brain volume, then as a result of activities x , y , etc., the brain volume in hominids increased. Divergences of opinion are restricted to the nature of the activities involved: Scenarioxy Engels tools language Oakley tools cooperation Washburn tools language Hockett and Ascher tools language Laughlin tools – Hill tools hunting All the versions accept that cultural activities preceded expansion of the brain; this idea is formulated most succinctly by Sherwood Washburn, who writes that ‘the reason that the human brain makes the human way of life possible is that it is the result of that way of life’.  The development of the brain becomes necessary, according to our scenarios, when culture already exists. One might wonder why a large brain, which was not necessary for culture to appear, suddenly becomes indispensable when culture has taken shape. If culture emerges without this vast brain, why could it not have continued to exist without it? The authors left implicit the mechanism that might have governed this process. A comment by Darwin (‘the continued use of language will  Washburn,  :  ."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"In search of causes  have reacted on the brain, and produced an inherited effect’  ) suggests that we may have ‘Lamarckian’ reasoning here: culture (tools, language, cooperation, hunting, etc.) involves a more intense use of the brain, the continual exercise strengthens it and makes it grow; these effects, according to Lamarck’s second law, are hereditary; therefore ‘culture’ implies a large brain. Darwin appealed to premises such as these when he was trying to understand the difference between the brain volume in domestic and wild rabbits: ‘I have shown that the brains of domes- tic rabbits are considerably reduced in bulk in comparison with those of the wild rabbit or hare; and this may be attributed to their hav- ing been closely confined during many generations, so that they have exerted but little their intellect, senses and voluntary movements.’  According to this type of reasoning, culture would be the main factor requiring the use of the brain, previously immersed – as na ̈ ıve anthro- pology imagines – in a numbing dullness: without culture, the cerebral organ would have been little used and this disuse made its development impossible. While ‘Lamarckism’ has foundered in disgrace, the ‘culture → large brain’ relation has survived its disappearance. We find it again in Washburn’s scenario, supported this time by a Darwinian argument: the author assumes that the handling of tools, the use of speech and other human activities are subject to control by specialised areas of the brain whose development may have been fostered by the existence of culture. Lacking the competence to assess the plausibility of this expla- nation, I will confine myself to reminding readers that the author himself declares this to be unverifiable.  But the example deserves attention, for it raises another interesting question: how is it that a ‘Lamarckian’ formula can be so easily replaced by a Darwinian one? The reason may be that the traditional explanations lend themselves easily to Darwinian reformulations, without the classic ‘causal’ sequences being in any way challenged. FROM THE USE OF TOOLS TO FREE AND SKILFUL HANDS This relation furnishes another example of the move from ‘Lamarckian’ arguments to ‘Darwinian’ explanation. The first is clearly revealed in the reasoning of Engels:   Darwin  , II :  .  Ibid. , I :  .  Washburn  :  .  Engels  /  :  –  ."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" Explaining human origins  .

Engels’ text was the principal reference of the Soviet prehistorian P. I. Boriskovski  who, by the way, proclaims his Marxist orientation explicitly, and on several occasions. In  , he returns to the ‘tools → free and skilful hands’ relation as part of the ‘Marxist’ heritage, without, however, explaining the mechanism by which the hand develops; we can onlysuspectthathisconceptionremainsasLamarckianasthatofEngels: thetoolthatreplacesthecanineteeth,andsocausestheirreductionfrom lack of use, accentuates, in parallel, the use of the hand, which develops as a result. Yet Darwinian rhetoric too can provide a justification for this causal relation: the anthropologist Kim Hill assumes that using tools favoured changes in the morphology of the hand.  The argument is fairly vague: although the author seems to invoke natural selection, no precise mech- anism is envisaged. The substitution of ‘Darwinian’ for ‘Lamarckian’ explanations is an interesting problem, to which I shall return later when the different categories of palaeoanthropological explanations will be compared.Ishallmerelyobserveherethatbothvariantsoftheargument take for granted that the hand was less used before the appearance of tools (a paradisal state in which hands do not get blistered?) and that its intensive use is connected only with tools, the sole and unique pretext for manual manipulations.

This reasoning is indeed curious: the large brain, the organ of thought, would have appeared when human cognitive capacities already existed. Darwin  made explicit ‘Lamarckian’ principles underlying this unex- pectedprocess,andR.Ardreylateraffirmeditstillmoreexplicitly,saying that our ancestors developed their brain by thinking.  In other words, the increased cognitive faculties would have intensified brain use, as a result of which the cerebral organ would have increased in size, like the biceps of an athlete. So ‘mental faculties’ would have acted on the brain in the same way as the principle of use, just as tools and language did in the explanations we have already analysed. This notion provides a singular view of human history, divided into a thought-less prehuman period, in which the brain was used little or even not at all, and a thought-full human period, where the brain is used daily. For Ardrey, these two periods coincide with the demarcation line separating the period of paradisal inertia from the subsequent times of struggle for existence, in the course of which human beings were forced to emerge from ‘numbing dullness’.  A similar notion can also be found in the works of Conjectural His- tory, which set primordial man in a paradisal environment ‘where he wandered at will in the peace and freedom of vast solitudes’,  his brain unused since no ingenuity was required to satisfy the basic needs.  The cataclysm that opened the period of struggle against hostile nature and imposed the necessity of social life made the use of brain essen- tial: ‘The great preponderance of the cerebral organ’, imagines Virey, ‘ ... increased still more with its continual use in the social state.’  ‘The intellectual faculties of social man’, added Delam ́ etherie, ‘take up con- siderable energy, because the thinking organ is perfecting itself by all the exercise it is given.’  These arguments, based on the Lamarckian principle of use, are won- derfully well adapted for the scheme of transition from mother nature to stepmother nature. Thought becomes a logical consequence of the end of the paradisal condition. Furthermore, since thought here comes be- fore the large brain, and the social state comes before thought, the latter has the modest role of an epiphenomenon in the hominisation process.  Darwin  , I :  .  Ardrey  :  –  ;inthe  reissue, these passages have been omitted.  Ibid .  Virey  , I :  .  E.g.

FROM MENTAL FACULTIES TO PERFECTIBILITY According to six of the scenarios, ‘perfectibility’ constitutes a distinctive feature of humanity.  In the eighteenth century, it was widely believed that perfectibility had to be considered as a peculiarity of man, and was deemed as important as language itself.  In the prolific debate on the soul of animals, that had been going on since the seventeenth century, there were some attempts to extend that faculty to the ani- mal world, but Buffon acted as a mouthpiece for the dominant opinion when he asserted that ‘animals invent nothing and perfect nothing’ (this idea was also expressed by the very in fluential Bossuet  ). There was general agreement to associate perfectibility with the faculty for trans- forming and ‘improving’ culture (tools, society, laws, language, etc.). This restricted perfectibility to our species, since all these cultural at- tributes were held to be non-existent, or at least rudimentary in ani- mals. Three of our scenarios declare that the origin of human perfectibil- ity stems from ‘mental faculties’ which, as they developed, would have led our ancestors to perfect their ‘labour’ and ‘language’,  to improve hunting tactics,  to invent and manufacture tools.  Similar views were already appearing in Lucretius, for whom the de- velopment of culture was due to ‘intellectual experiments’.  In the eighteenth century, Rousseau was not alone in thinking that ‘the clearer the mind became, the more industry improved’.  The discoveries and technical innovations of the Enlightenment were sufficiently numerous to suggest the idea of a causal link between intellectual effort and the progress of civilisation, until it became commonplace. It must be acknowledged that this relationship, transposed into pre- history, provides perfectly plausible explanations for cultural change.  Engels  /  ; Coon  /  ; Washburn  ; Ardrey  /  ; Hockett and Ascher  ; Laughlin  .  E.g.

In the first place, our scenarios set out the relation between mental faculties and cultural im- provements in an exceedingly vague way, which is difficult to test: noth- ing is said about the nature of these ‘mental faculties’ or the precise nature of ‘improvements’. Second, any attempt to define the notion of improvement would bring us back to the old sterile and tedious debates about progress. If we accept the current meaning of the word, it is dif- ficult to avoid tautology because dictionaries define perfectibility as ‘the character of what is perfectible’ ( Petit Robert ); at the same time, we will have to admit that perfectibility is not exclusively human property, as- sociated with cognitive faculties that permit a teleological anticipation, since ‘improvement’, as everyday language understands it, may also be the outcome of the process of selection, operating through interactions between living beings and their milieux. An explanation that places ‘mental faculties’ on the side of the causes provides an opportunity to reflect on the role of cognition in the an- thropogenesis scenarios. Our authors introduce ‘mental faculties’ into hominisation at a point where the process is far advanced: our ancestors are not only walking upright with free hands, they are also making tools, hunting in groups, living in society and using language. Indeed, recent palaeoanthropological data confirm that important anatomical trans- formations, such as bipedalism and its morphological consequences, preceded brain growth; so the development of certain ‘mental facul- ties’ would have come later and could not explain earlier phenomena. Consequently, it is no longer possible to defend theories that seek, for example,tomaketheoriginofbipedalismaresultof‘mentalfaculties’.  However, it is intriguing to observe that cognition also plays almost no part in explanations of cultural phenomena. Thought would have had no part in the genesis of culture and served only to ‘perfect’ it. This is a strange, yet common view, with numerous paleoanthropologists con- sidering any contrary notion as a fantasy based on prejudices peculiar, they say, to intellectuals with an irritating tendency to overestimate the significance of thought.  Yet if we cling to cultural evolution, there is no alternative but to recognisethatboththeseviews,onethatovervaluestheimpactofmental faculties in this process and one that underestimates it a priori ,havevery few arguments in their favour.

Yet the ‘self-evidence’ is dubious and it seems necessary to examine what underlies it. The life of our ancestors was ‘just a frantic search for food’, states C. Coon, and they ‘spent most of the day’ at it.  According to P. I. Boriskovski, at the starting point of hominisation, ‘the level of develop- ment of the forces of production was so low that it hardly outstripped the problems of the search for food’,  so that men’s thinking was of necessity reduced to issues directly concerned with their basic needs. Ardrey believed that, for our ancestors, thought could not flourish until their ‘daily life was freed from the eternal munching’.  So the opinion that the difficulties of primitive existence were so great that they left nei- ther time nor energy for exercising mental faculties is widely shared (as if the constant quest for food could not equally well be an occasion for exercising the mind). We have already noted the presence of this idea in schoolbooks. Now we must add that it also figures among the well-known themes of histoire raisonn ́ ee . Condorcet wrote: ‘There is a feeling that the uncertainty and difficulty of providing for subsistence, the necessary alternatives of ex- treme fatigue and absolute rest, never left room for a state of leisure in which man can indulge in thought and enrich his understanding with new combinations of ideas.’  So too for Voltaire, we had first to wait for culture to improve our ancestors’ lives ‘before anyone was to be found who had leisure enough for meditation’.  According to J. Millar, even ‘savages’ who already possess the rudi- ments of culture, but are still reduced to hunting, gathering and fishing in order to live, will never be able to indulge in reflection because they are obliged to devote all their energies to satisfying basic needs.  In the sameperiod,Burnet  andBoulanger  weredescribingprimitivelifeas an unthinking state, and, a few decades later, J.-J.

I merely note the compatibility of these two views without claiming that one is derived from the other. Indeed, the significance of ‘thought’ in the genesis of culture is also underestimated by authors who reject the view of a hard life and place the first humans in the bosom of bountiful nature. This was already the case in the period when Rousseau was writing that ‘everything seems to distance savage people from the temptation and the means to cease to be so ... Their imagination conjures up nothing, their heart asks for nothing. Their modest needsaresoeasilytohandandtheyaresofarfromtheknowledge necessarytomakethemdesiretoacquiremore,thattheycanhaveneither foresight nor curiosity.’  So, whatever view is taken of primitive nature, na ̈ ıve anthropology finds sufficient reasons to ascribe thoughtlessness to the first humans. If nature is hostile, it leaves no energy for exercising the intellect; if it is paradisal, it provides no stimulus for reflection. It goes without say- ing, therefore, that our ancestors did not think. The way in which their environment is represented merely provides a framework for ad hoc ar- guments that will justify this main thesis one way or another – a thesis that clings to the image of primitive bestiality, depicted in conformity with the principle of contrast: since the existence of modern humanity is dominated by thought, thought must be absent from the life of primor- dial humanity. This absence is an attribute of its animal condition, as is hairiness or nudity. Consequently, the evolution of ‘mental faculties’ is often envisaged as a process leading from nothing to everything, or –as E. Haeckel put it – from ‘ homo stupidus to homo sapiens ’.  FROM HUNTING TO COOPERATION It has long been maintained that the emergence of cooperation was an important landmark in the transition from the animal state of nature to the social stage of culture. Some of the scenarios make the first forms of cooperation a direct consequence of hunting. The general argument is  Virey  , I :  ; see also Le Roy  /  b:  .  Rousseau  /  :  .  Haeckel  :  ."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" Explaining human origins that cooperation would be indispensable to hunting.  Only one of our authors  develops this idea more fully, as follows:  .

If (c) ibid. , andif (d) thecooperationofseveralindividualsreducesriskswhen hunting, then (e) cooperationappearedasaconsequenceofthefirsthunting activities, in order to reduce risk. This explanation may be plausible but it is not the only one conceiv- able;moreover,itgivesrisetoseveralobjections.First,cooperationisalso seen in animals, and although it sometimes coincides with hunting,  it cannot be restricted to that type of activity alone, while forgetting other occupations for which it is useful or necessary. Second, both primatology and ethnology provide descriptions of hunting methods that do not ex- pose the hunter to the slightest risk. Thirdly, no palaeoanthropological data can confirm or disprove this hypothesis. That being so, on what do our authors base their affirmation that all hunts are dangerous, that they require cooperation and that this was the origin of the earliest forms of cooperation? To answer these questions we have to bear in mind the meanings with which the notion of hunting is charged in our scenarios. We should recall that conjectural anthropology was very attached to the image of continual warfare between primitive men and animals, which would have compelled our naturally weak ancestors to join forces to confront the menace of the beasts.  Traces of this view are also apparent in our palaeoanthropological scenarios and three of them express it explicitly, positing that the earliest humans had been obliged to cooperate to defend themselves against wild animals. In underlying arguments it is easy to find the classic notion of human weakness and incessant attacks  Jolly  :  ; Ruyle  :  ; Boriskovski  :  .  Hockett and Ascher  :  .  E.g.

An analysis of the context from which this idea emerged in ancient Greek tradition will be found in Schnapp  :  –  .

The similarity can be explained by the juxtaposition of the notion of hunting and that of struggle against animals. Philosophical conjectures provide abundant historical testimony to this kind of assimi- lation. So, for A.-Y. Goguet, ‘most peoples of Antiquity considered that hunting was the occupation of the primordial men. They took to it as much from the need for subsistence as from the necessity of defending their lives against attacks by wild animals.’  This opinion finds an echo in J.-J. Virey: ‘so they had to unite to overcome powerful animals so as to escape from them and feed on them.’  This explanation, traces of whichcanstillbefoundinarecenttext,  leadstoattributestraditionally associated with a struggle against ‘fierce beasts’ being projected on to hunting activities . Thus, in the imagery of na ̈ıve anthropolog y, primitive hunting became synonymous with a dangerous confrontation with sav- age monsters in which the solitary hunter constantly defied death. And hunting took on not only the attributes of a ‘bloody struggle’, but also its function, that of the chief cause of cooperation. This transformation offers us yet another example of the conceptual change in which a new arrangement of old elements preserves the trace of former meanings. FROM COOPERATION TO SOCIAL LIFE Herbert Spencer stated that ‘society exists only when to juxtaposition is added cooperation’.  This opinion was widespread in Conjectural History, for which social life is simply a function of cooperation; accord- ing to this, the beginnings of society would mix with the emergence of cooperation, which had been reduced, as we have seen, to subsistence activities. The same idea turns up again in three of our scenarios,  and not a single one of the twenty-four casts doubt on it. Yet even leaving aside the meagreness of the verifiable implications offered by such a hypothesis, its bias seems striking. Social life is reduced to a purely utilitarian and eco- nomic function, from which a whole universe of arbitrary conventions, rivalries and conflicts is quite simply missing.

Since society is the fruit of necessary cooperation, it is believed that this necessity did not existpreviously,andthatman’sancestorsledindividual,presociallives.It is easy to recognise the ancient view of a period of paradisal abundance, when‘eachonewenthisownwayinsearchoffruitandherbs ’,  allthen being capable of obtaining food without the help of others. Lucretius and Diodorus Siculus  were already painting a similar picture of the primordial existence, and in the eighteenth century the idea of the solitary life of the earliest humans became more firmly embedded in popular imagery.  In the twentieth century, colourful speculations concerning that grave event, the first encounter between two humans, still persist. Here is how E. Haraucourt imagined it in a ‘prehistoric novel’ which portrays the first tˆete-` a-tˆ ete between a male and a female: A punch on the forehead stunned but did not defeat her and she returned to attack. She buried her teeth in the shoulder of the male who had grabbed her round the waist; it was his turn to scream; picking up a stone, he dealt her such a vicious blow on the top of her head that she collapsed: circles of light were whirling in front of her and she was vaguely aware of a violent mass hurling its weight on her back ... When she reopened her eyes, the conqueror was still clasping her but was not devouring her.  Thisisagoodillustrationofthefirmbeliefthatexistencewasoriginally solitary and that the first meeting was not without some difficulties. This view conforms very well to the old habit of defining the original state as a mirror-image of ourselves; because civilised man is a zˆoon politicon , the lives led by prehuman creatures must necessarily be presocial and individual.

Thus they speak of the language that corresponds to the needs of the group,  of the development of language,  of a flexible means of communication,  of a system of symbolic communication  or simply of a means of communication.  These terms are as varied as they are vague and it is impossible to evaluate the main assumption of this reasoning (‘life in society requires the use of language’) without specifying what is understood by ‘society’ and by the ‘language’ deemed indissociable from it. If it is a question of articulate language, the generalisation is faulty, since such language does not exist in animal societies; if it is a question of a system of communication in general, the proposition is inadequate to explain the origin of articulate speech. C. F. Hockett and R. Ascher present a more elaborate piece of rea- soning. They declare that the need for a flexible means of communi- cation (language) appeared with a ‘complex social organisation’. Re- course to communication by means of gesture language was impossible, these authors argue, because, during the hunt, the hands of the earliest men were holding weapons and their eyes were constantly watching the movements of their prey. Furthermore, since bipedal creatures had free hands,theywerenolongerobligedtotransportfoodbyholdingitintheir teeth; the mouth had thus been freed for speech, which thenceforward became established as the most effective means of communication.  This reasoning rests on several perfectly unfalsifiable premises and il- lustrates a mode of conjecturing that is typical of most of our authors, for whom language, like many other human characteristics, would re- sult solely from economic constraints, in this case the necessity of the hunt. In all these arguments, the origin of language is explained by the need to communicate, which is supposed to emerge as soon as our ancestors engaged in social relations.

According to an ancient idea, the earliest humans did not speak because, living alone, they had no need of speech.  This notion becomes a recurrent theme in speculations on the origins of language that flourished during the Enlightenment. Rousseau asserted that ‘not interacting with each other, and with no need to do so, humans do not conceive of any necessity for such an invention [language], nor any possibility of it, unless it were indispensable’.  For J. Burnet, ‘although a solitary savage might in process of time acquire the habit of forming ideas, it is impossible to suppose that he would invent a method of communicating them, for which he has no occasion’.  The ‘utilitarian’ premises of that notion found particularly clear ex- pression in J.-J. Virey: ‘Without the ties of immediate usefulness to unite them [humans], it would be neither possible nor useful to create a language.’  Thus society makes its appearance for a utilitarian reason, asdoeslanguage,necessaryforsocialintercourse.Societymadelanguage possible because it made it useful; and if language did not exist in the ‘presocial period’, it is because humans had no need of it. It is interesting to observe that our scenarios pay little heed to the biological conditions indispensable for an articulate language (larynx, cerebral centres, oral cavity of a particular shape).  Of course, social life may favour vocal communication, one means of which is language, but we should not on that account neglect anatomy and neurology. This disparaging attitude had some justification in the eighteenth century, when the first dissections of primates provided the authority: natural- ists frequently referred to the work of Edward Tyson, who concluded, after examining the remains of a young chimpanzee, that its tongue, larynx and brain were identical to those of humans.  By pointing to decisive factors outside biology, this mistaken conclusion subsequently determined the way in which the origin of language was envisaged for more than a century. So it was asserted that apes, who some authors stated to be ignorant of life in society, are deprived of speech because they have no need to communicate; later it was deduced that ‘language’ isaresultofthatneed,whichappearedwithsociallife.Certainpalaeoan- thropologists still argue on those lines, although they know that the brain of humans, just like the larynx or the oral cavity, is different from that of apes.  In spite of that, our authors restrict the conditions for the  E.g.

FROM HUNTING TO SEXUAL DIVISION OF LABOUR AND FOOD - SHARING Nine of our scenarios assume that sexual division of labour and food- sharing appeared in the wake of the development of hunting.  Five of them, taking this explanation further, suggest that hunting had first imposedasexualdistributionofsubsistencetasksandthatlaterthiswould have led to food-sharing. As most of the authors associate the division of labour with the sharing of its products, I shall examine jointly these two supposed consequences of hunting. On this subject, the scenarios offer two distinct arguments. The first appears in one text only, that of Carleton Coon.  The author considers that man’s ancestors began hunting small game as soon as they left their tree shelter to live on the ground. Then, with time, as their skills pro- gressed, they attacked big herbivores as well, such as antelopes. Added to this hypothesis is the conviction that the males would have been the first to indulge in the new hunt for big game. This leads to the following generalisation: ‘in every shift of occupation of which we know through- out history, women have taken over the jobs formerly held by men as the men have moved on to something new and more specialised’.  Aside from the na ̈ ıve reference to a ‘law’ claiming to be based on one of the invariants of History, but stemming in reality from a fiction of misogy- nist ‘common sense’, no supplementary argument is adduced to prop up this apparently universal rule, which is also found, although more rarely, in other works of American anthropology of this period.  Coon claims thathuntingbiggamebecameamasculinetask,whilewomencontinued to catch small, slow animals: thus the first division of labour was born. This reasoning implies a singular view of both sexes: the male, enter- prising and endowed with an inventive spirit, the creator of progress, is contrasted with a passive female, obliged to await the fruits of mascu- line ingenuity. The misogynist character of this conception, added to the complete impossibility of confirming or disconfirming it with archaeo- logical data, exempts me from further comment on its epistemological  Ardrey  /  :  ; Leroi-Gourhan  :  ; Laughlin  :  ; Jolly  :  –  ; Isaac  a:  ; Hill  :  ; Lumsden and Wilson  :  ; Kelso and Quiatt  :  ; Coon’s scenario (  /  :  –  ) restricts the consequences of hunting to food-sharing only.  Coon  /  :  –  .  Ibid .:  .  E.g.

However, we shall see later that such arguments, quite apart from the sexism for which they are commonly criticised today, convey a whole body of traditional beliefs of na ̈ ıve anthropology. Meanwhile, we shall analyse the second type of argument, which is shared by more of the scenarios. Its core can be set out as follows: If (a) at a certain period, our ancestors began to practise hunting, andif (b) huntingnecessitatesasexualdivisionoflabourandfood- sharing, then (c) when they started hunting, our ancestors were obliged to inaugurate sexual division of labour and practise food-sharing. Only one scenario stops short at such a summary argument, in which nothing is said about the reasons why hunting should always impose division of labour and food-sharing. In other texts, the data base proves richer and allows the analysis to probe more deeply. First of all, we shall note the general character of the tasks that devolve to both sexes: ScenarioMenWomen Coon hunting large animals hunting small game Ardrey ? ? Leroi-Gourhan hunting gathering Laughlin ? ? Jolly hunting gathering Isaac hunting gathering Hill hunting gathering Lumsden and Wilson hunting gathering Kelso and Quiatt hunting gathering With the exception of Coon’s scenario and two other texts that do not specifythenatureofmasculineandfeminineoccupations,whileasserting they were distinct, the five authors agree in assigning hunting to men and gathering to women. Gathering would be the most ancient means of subsistence and the introduction of hunting, added to gathering, would lead inevitably to a division of labour. Leroi-Gourhan summed up the usual explanation of this phenomenon by a very clear formula: ‘The very slow growth of children rendered women naturally less mobile; given the double character of Palaeolithic subsistence, based on hunting and gathering, the primitive group had no other organic solution than that of men hunting and women gathering.’   Leroi-Gourhan  :  ."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"In search of causes  Thesexualdivisionoflabouramonghunter-gathererswouldthushave beenlinked,ononehand,totheweightofthereproductivefunctionswith which women are burdened, and on the other, to the greater difficulty of hunting compared to gathering.

These assertions quite clearly imply a particular view of hunting, seen as the pursuit of animals, demanding ‘virile strength’ and ‘mobility’. If we accept these assumptions, we are led to believe that any human group living from hunting and gathering is obliged to share out these tasks between the two sexes. It is ‘the only organic solution’, declares Leroi-Gourhan. The sexual division of labour would have been subject to biological determinism that would make it a purely natural phenomenon. The scenarios grant it the status of a general law, assert- ing that masculine hunting and feminine gathering are the rule not only among recent hunter-gatherers but also among chimpanzees and ba- boons. This rule, raised to the status of a law of nature, valid at all times and in all places, could thereafter be projected into the prehistoric past of our species and form a solid deductive basis for bold reconstructions.

One could object that this criticism is irrelevant. Apart from the Agta, women go hunting only rarely, sometimes only in the case of the sickness ordeathoftheirhusbands;  sothefactthatwomenhuntinexceptional circumstances does not disconfirm the principle of a habitual division of labourbetweenthesexes.Itmightbesaidtobemorejudiciousandmore efficient that women, hampered by pregnancies and childcare, should leave hunting to men. The division of subsistence tasks, therefore, would be the result not of absolute and inevitable necessity, but of a concern for efficiency (this version is found in the authors who assume that food was abundant in the first hominids’ environment). This kind of argument rests on certain assumptions, the weaknesses of which were clearly perceived by Alain Testart:  Premise  Hunting demands great mobility Hunting techniques exist that do not require great mobility,  whereas gatheringmaysometimesinvolvecoveringlongdistances.Asanexample, Testart recalls that a !Kung woman, frequently carrying a young child, covers an average of  km a year.  Premise  Women are immobilised by their maternal duties The care lavished on children may indeed reduce women’s mobility, but it does not follow that they are thereby excluded from hunting. Among the Agta, mothers undoubtedly hunt less than girls or old women, but it is not unusual for them to go hunting, leaving their children in the care of grandparents, older brothers and sisters or husbands.  Since the authors of our scenarios have no hesitation in corroborating their ‘laws’ with zoological observations, we in turn remind them that in the case of African wild dogs who go hunting, juveniles are always left at their base site under the protection of an adult guard, who is often not the mother, nor even a female.  Premise  By reserving the heavy hunting tasks for men, hunter-gatherers are aiming at economic efficiency If it is not unusual for women to take part in hunting and be bur- dened with the same tasks as men, they are often barred, on the other  Landes  :  .  Flannery  :  .  Jennes  :  .  Goodale  :  –  .  E.g. among the Ojibwa and the Cree, Flannery  :  ; Landes  :  .  Testart  .  Examples in Testart  :  –  .  Lee  :  .  Estioko-Griffin  :  .  Kuhne  ."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"In search of causes  hand – notes Alain Testart – from using the same tools.  For example, the Northern Ojibwa men fish using lances and nets while the women may only use nets.  Among the Central Eskimo, the men hunt seals with harpoons, whereas the women hunt only with bludgeons, less ef- ficient tools, the use of which makes long-distance hunting impossible, so reducing the chances of success.  When the Copper Eskimo fish for salmon, the harpoon is reserved for men, while the women are allowed to catch fish only with their bare hands.  When beaters are being em- ployed, women often make up the group of beaters, whose work is the hardest and demands the greatest mobility.  In the face of these observations it is difficult to maintain that the sex- ual division of labour is always ‘natural’ or ‘organic’ in character. Al- though there were groups of hunter-gatherers living in environments which made this kind of division of labour efficient, there were numer- ous societies in which, far from freeing the women from drudgery, this custom makes their duties still heavier. What is more, the highly prized view of the ‘natural’ solution is not the only conceivable one. It is equally possible to seek the reasons for the sharing out of tasks by sex in the realm of beliefs rather than of biologyandpracticalimperatives.RobertLowieobservedthatthesexual division of labour seems to a large extent to be a matter of convention. That is to say, it has nothing to do with the physiological characteristics of the two sexes; this can be proved by comparing the different rules in force, sometimes in neighbouring tribes.  Taking a large number of examples, Alain Testart has observed that many taboos exist among these peoples, barring women from contact with hunting weapons such as spears, javelins, harpoons, bows and arrows, etc.  So it may be that we were wrong to speak of a division of labour, in so far as cross-cultural data demonstrate  that men can and sometimes do perform all kinds of womanly tasks, while women find themselves excluded from certain occupations strictly reserved for men. It would seem to be more a matter of prohibition thanofdivision.Thus,stillaccordingtoAlainTestart,itisnot somuchhuntingthatisforbiddentowomenastheuseofcertainweapons without which hunting may be impracticable. So what is conventionally called ‘division of labour’ among hunter-gatherers would be the result of a taboo, which leads, perhaps indirectly, to the exclusion of women from certain types of hunting.  Testart  :  –  .  Landes  :  .  Boas  :  .  Jennes  :  .  E.g.

Testart notes that the arms in question are the ones that penetrate the animal’s flesh and cause blood to flow, or else come into direct contact with the blood of the prey.  Moreover, the ban is particularly strict for women during their periods. There are very widespread beliefs that their contact with the tools of hunting could have particularly harmful consequences: ‘Any hunting tools that she touches or steps over will become unusable’, say the Siberian hunters, ‘the gun won’t fire, fish will flee the nets and fur animals the traps’.  The Kwakiutl believed that if menstrual blood contaminated their huntingtools,gamewouldnolongerallowitselftobecaught.  Accord- ing to the Bella Coola, who lived by fishing, menstrual blood possesses a very malignant power: ‘At certain periods, women do not have the right to bathe for fear that a drop of blood might blind the fish and prevent them finding their way.’  On the other hand, for hunting practices that do not shed blood, as L ́ evi-Strauss has already noted, women may ex- ert a beneficial influence during their periods.  So the essential point of these practices would be to separate animal blood from menstrual blood, by virtue of a theory that Testart considers to be universal among hunter-gatherers.  IammentioningTestart’shypothesisherenotbecauseIamconvinced by his argument, but because it offers us an alternative to the traditional explanations, which, from this very fact, can no longer be held to be the only conceivable ones.

But we must stress that the hypothesis of the universality of ‘blood ideology’ has not been tested and does not accord with some of the available information, for example concerning hunting Agta women. Alain Testart is right when he states that the sexual division of labour is more easily and effectively explained by the doxa than by the praxis , but it remains to be verified whether ‘blood ideology’ always underlies this phenomenon and whether it is really universal.

There is no need, moreover, to go looking for other examples of such ideasamongnon-Westerncultures,orsolelyinconnectionwithhunting: they have existed and still do exist in our own Western culture. The his- torian J. Delumeau notes that, in the Middle Ages, many theologians, referring explicitly to Pliny’s Natural history , asserted that menstrual blood contains an evil force that prevents plants germinating, kills vegetation, rusts iron and sends dogs mad. ‘Penitentials forbid women to take com- munion during menstruation, or even to enter a church. Hence, more generally, the ban on women celebrating mass, touching sacred vessels, having access to ritual functions.’  This type of taboo, whose roots in the Bible (Leviticus)  and in Antiquity (Pliny)  are well known, has persisted in our culture down to the nineteenth century, as Victor Hugo’s observation bears witness: A part of the catacombs in Paris is devoted to growing button mushrooms.

It is intriguing to observe that anthropologists, themselves raised in a cultural tradition that eliminates womenfromcertaintasksforpurelysymbolicreasons,continuetotreata similar exclusion among others as a simple effect of biologico-economic factors. This attitude stems from another tradition, a materialist one this time, still firmly anchored in the common sense of today. ‘Man is more courageous, pugnacious and energetic than woman and has a more inventive genius’, wrote Darwin.  It is a long time since the conviction appeared whereby the social status of women is simply the consequence of their physical frailty (for example in Buffon  ) and of the ‘deficiency’ of their mind which ‘is not capable – according to Delam ́ etherie – of great schemes or profound conceptual combinations’.  ‘Duetoherweakness’,wroteCabanis,‘woman ... has  Delumeau  :  .  Leviticus XV .  –  .  Pliny the Elder  :  .  Hugo  /  :  ; see also Verdier  .  Darwin  , II :  .  Buffon  /  :  .  Delam ́ etherie  :  ."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"   Explaining human origins had to stay inside the house or hut. Particular indispositions and child care have kept her, or constantly returned her, there ... Unable to bear the fatigues, face the hazards, withstand the tumultuous impact of great assemblies of men, she has left to them those heavy tasks, those dangers they had chosen for preference.’  Rousseau likewise attributed to purely natural reasons the fact that ‘women became more sedentary, grew accustomed to looking after the hut and the children, while the men went in search of their common subsistence’.  In eighteenth-century historical conjectures, hunting was already as- sociated with hardships and fatigue which only men were capable of fac- ing, while gathering, considered easy work, was assigned to women.  Thisvisionofthehunt,moreover,cametobeloadedwithallthenegative connotationslinkedtosubsistenceappropriatetohumansbanishedfrom paradise. Gathering, on the other hand, a feature of life in the Garden of Eden or in the Golden Age when vegetarian humans were still living in harmony with animals, conveys all the symbolic charge of a paradisal occupation, hence it is light and easy.  This view is combined with the old theory of ‘the imbecility of the female nature’, the written history of which can be traced back to Plato.  Such a superposition of ideas leads to the belief that at the time when humans were obliged to kill to survive, the sexual division of labour must have been the only possible solution. Condorcet concluded that ‘the frailty of women excluded them from hunting’.  That is why hunting became the man’s duty while ‘paradisal’ gathering was assigned to ‘frail’ woman. Here we have an eloquent example of the way na ̈ ıve anthropology lays the foundations of its inferences, resting them on ‘general laws’ which are deemed to sanction the validity of deductive reasoning. The ideas of the ‘hardships of hunting’, of the ‘frailty of women’ and of the ‘organic necessity’ of the sexual division of labour among hunter- gatherers provide typical illustrations of this type of ‘law’.

This has interesting consequences for the way we envisage hominisa- tion. If the division of subsistence tasks derived from the eternal nature of both sexes, we should be entitled to propose convincing conjectures about the division of labour among the hominids of a few million years ago, the male still being male and the female female.

It is interesting to note how insistently some of our scenarios tend to reduce the first human society to an epiphenomenon of nutrition, with foodexchangeandmutualrelationspresentedasitsdirectconsequences. The testimony of ethnographic data proclaims unanimously that the contrary is just as conceivable: food-sharing may be not the cause but the effect of social bonds that determine more or less arbitrarily the duties of reciprocity. Of course, when the hypothesis based on this last possibility is applied to prehistory, it is hardly open to verification, but the opposite conjecture, that our scenarios accept so readily, is no more testable. It is significant that of the two hypotheses, both equally weak in methodological terms, it is again the hypothesis in closest agreement with the traditional view that is favoured: the hypothesis whereby society is a product of economic constraints de fined by the basic needs of the individual; the hypothesis whereby social life emerged from cooperation between hunters joining forces to overcome powerful animals and to confront ‘ferocious beasts’. FROM HUNTING TO THE USE OF TOOLS The last relation of those which appear at least three times in our scenar- ios associates the origin of tools with hunting activities.  The reasoning is as follows: If (a) at a certain period, our ancestors started hunting, andif (b) hunting requires the use of tools, then (c) the use of tools appeared as a consequence of the first hunting activities. This formula may be completed with propositions indicating the different reasons why tools would have been indispensable to the first hunters. The primatologist Clifford Jolly and the prehistorian Glynn L. Isaac insisted on the necessity of dismembering animal carcasses, while the anthropologist Eugene E. Ruyle assumed that hunting was impracti- cable without tools. The authors thus follow the typical strategy of classic explanations: to clarify the origin of a human characteristic ( tools ), a con- dition is posited and assimilated to the ‘cause’ ( hunting ); subsequently,  Laughlin  :  ; Jolly  :  ; Ruyle  :  ; Isaac  a:  ."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"In search of causes  a practical usefulness is sought (what could tools have been used for?) which might justify the necessity for the emergence of the characteristic whose origin they are trying to explain.

A mere glance reveals that, of these twenty-one most widespread causal explanations, fourteen are based on ‘relations’ postulated before  (eight even date from Antiquity), four were pro- posed in the second half of the nineteenth century, and we are indebted to contemporary anthropologists for only three (Table  ). As to the list of the thirty-seven ‘human characteristics’ at stake in the construction of the hominisation scenarios, no fewer than twenty-two are already at- tested to in the literature of classical Antiquity, while seven appear in works published in the eighteenth and mid-nineteenth centuries; only seven originate in works of twentieth-century science (Table  ).   It should be remembered that, in this list, we are dealing with features considered to be either distinctive of humans in general compared with animals, or else distinctive of the early humans compared with their direct ancestors. I have excluded the concept of ‘culture’ from this list; it is mentioned in one scenario but the significance proved too variable over the centuries for historical comparisons to be possible. As to the other positions on this list, it is undeniable that contemporary scientists do not define ‘tools’, ‘bipedalism’ or ‘sociability’ in the same way as the ancient authors or the philosophers of the Enlightenment.

In the nine- teenth century, only one relation – the one put forward by Darwin (en- vironmental change → bipedalism) was a true innovation, in so far as it was based on the new concept of natural selection. The other two (tools → reduced canine teeth; tools → large brain) rest on Lamarckian premises which themselves are derived from a set of ideas dating back to Antiquity. For the twentieth century, only the relation linking the emer- gence of language to the use of tools  is a genuinely new one, although it is based on the traditional conviction whereby the tool was the first manifestation of culture. In the end, the remaining innovations are com- binatory rearrangements of conventional ideas: (a)‘tools → bipedalism’  isonlyaninversionoftherelation‘bipedalism → tools’; (b) ‘food-sharing → social life ’ is a transformation of the classic sequence ‘[collective]hunting → sociallife’,wherethefood-sharing,alogicalcon- sequence of collective hunting, left tacit in the arguments of na ̈ıve an- thropology, is made explicit so as to become an intermediary element between ‘hunting’ and ‘social life’.

This observation is confirmed when the arguments underlying the relations are analysed. Their content reveals a whole stock of ideas stem- ming from ancient common-sense imagery. We are struck first by the powerful influence still exerted by the idea of transition from a pre- human, paradisal state to the toiling human existence of the subse- quent period. The impact of this conception is particularly plain to see in the way ecological changes are viewed, but it has left much more important traces in our scenarios. This conjectural scheme pro- vides the authors with a whole spectrum of attributes of the prehuman and early human periods, which can be reduced to a system of binary oppositions:  Oakley  :  .  Oakley  :  ."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":" Explaining human origins PrehumanperiodEarlyhumanperiod hospitable nature hostile nature mild climate harsh climate abundance of food shortage of food absence of predators threat from predators natural gentleness cruelty vegetarian diet carnivore diet leisure toil individual life social life Inscholarlyanthropologyasinitsconjecturalantecedents,thisscheme loses the symbolic meaning it used to have in the myths and becomes a basis for purely naturalist inferences, for example: If ‘vegetarian diet’, then ‘gathering’ If ‘ carnivore diet’, then ‘hunting’ If ‘leisure’, then ‘brain (or hands) disused’ If ‘toil’, then ‘frequent use of brain (or hands)’ If ‘individual life’, then ‘language useless and so absent’ If ‘social life’, then ‘language necessary and so present’ Thus the body of traditional oppositions is expanded by a series of inferences, so as to include new pairs of contrasts, such as: gathering/hunting, disuse of brain/frequent use of brain, absence of language/language, etc. This primitive scheme can be further enriched along other lines than those of naturalist inference. As the very earliest ‘paradisal’ pe- riod is often identified with an animal state, another system of opposites is grafted on to the antinomy of the periods, this time contrasting bestiality and humanity, so that ‘bestial’ attributes are added to the left- hand column of the original scheme and ‘human’ properties complete the right-hand column. From that moment, the prehuman condition of the paradisal period is found to be associated with a bent posture, non- bipedallocomotion,absenceoftools,andthenon-existenceofcharacter- istics such as social life, family organisation, cooperation, food-sharing, sexual division of labour, etc., so many opposites to the properties as- signed to the following, early human period, whose features are found in the right-hand column of the scheme.

So the juxtaposition of the attributes in the two opposite columns gives rise to a set of mutual ex- planations, sustained by makeshift arguments whose chief virtue is their plausibility in the eyes of common sense. A third way of using and transforming the primitive scheme remains: by inversion. The ‘paradisal’ attributes can be moved to the right-hand side of the binary structure (period B), while the negative properties take their place on the left-hand side (period A). This type of permutation does not change the explanatory procedure itself: for example, the at- tributes of a ‘mother nature’ can replace those of a ‘stepmother nature’ withoutmodifyingthepartplayedbyecologicalchange,whichcontinues to ‘explain’, in a determinist manner, the origin of hunting, of tools, of bipedalism, etc. The system of opposites can also suffer amputation of one of its two poles: the result is a static image of a single period, endowed with one type of characteristics, either positive or negative. Thus the tradition of na ̈ ıve anthropology offers us a set of ideas, the content of which may be developed or transformed by operations that prolongthebroadlinesoftheprimitivescheme,stillcapableofnurturing quite an abundance of anthropological speculation. In addition to this well-structured matrix, the authors of our texts turn other common-sense topics to good account. The examples are legion: the projection onto primitive humans of the attributes of the Wild Man, a folklore figure; the anthropogenic role of bipedalism with all the symbolic connotations that philosophical and theological tradi- tions assign to upright posture; a still lively Lamarckian principle, al- ways about to resurface in the arguments that claim to be in harmony with the most up-to-date evolutionary theory; the idea of the natural ‘frailty’ of women, linked with the ancient symbolic system of a weak, soft womanhood contrasted with a hard, strong manhood well adapted to hunting; the references to proverbs (‘necessity is the mother of in- vention’), or to illusions of introspection (‘thought is impossible without language’).

This procedure allows for the establishment of a certain consensus, the stability of which, for all its rel- ative nature, can only reassuringly lead to the belief that the conjectural method, despite its fragility, ultimately produces some intersubjective results, easily accepted by the majority of the scienti fic community. I have attempted to show that this consensus, far from proving the strength of the method, rather tends to reflect the weakness of our imag- ination, still remaining under the sway of common sense.

From this angle, conjectural anthropology, clinging to common-sense wisdoms, also seems to be a trap. In studying it, I have in mind not so much the history of ideas, rather their possible future: being more aware of the trap, we might be able to avoid it. And the pitfall here is in fact twofold. Na ̈ ıve anthropology, by conditioning our imagination, not only leads us to sift the hypotheses following a criterion that is not cognitively efficient (by their conformity to the old conjectural schemes and not by their empirical or theoretical relevance); it is also responsi- ble for reducing the variability of those hypotheses, and since scientific knowledge develops by competition between rival ideas, excessive stan- dardisationofourconjecturesjeopardisestheprogressofknowledge.For these two reasons, it seems to me important to be awake to the limits im- posed by the conceptual schemes of na ̈ ıve anthropology on our attempts to imagine the process of hominisation."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"CHAPTER  Evolutionary mechanisms: the constraints of nature or of imagination?

A separate group in this category consists of explanations that refer to the mechanism of ‘correlated variation’ or ‘correlation of growth’.  The logicist reconstruction to which all the hominisation scenarios have been subjected enables us to distinguish a total of  explana- tory sequences, each expressed by one or more inferential operations.

These appear in only  .  per cent of cases, so they play a very modest role in our scenarios, barely three times greater than Lamarckian principles, which are called on in  per cent of the causal sequences (Table  ). Because almost half the scenarios construct their explanations of an- thropogenesis without recourse to Darwinism, I suppose that the argu- ments of these texts would not have suffered overmuch if the theory of evolution had not existed. If Darwinism is commonly accepted, why do our texts make such limited use of it? Is it because their authors are under the illusion that they are using Darwinism? Or it is rather be- cause they do not need it? And if they do not feel the need for it, is it because Darwinism brings very little that is new to the ancient explana- tory framework? But, in that case, is it really Darwinism, rather than one of its na ̈ ıve applications, that our authors may have found credi- ble and relevant? In order to answer these questions, it is necessary to examine more closely the nature of the ‘traditional’ and ‘Darwinian’ ex- planations so as to throw more light on the differences separating them, and especially to delimit the points they have in common, which reveal the limitations to which both the ‘ancient’ and ‘modern’ explanatory patterns are subject. ‘ TRADITIONAL ’ EXPLANATIONS The form of the ‘traditional’ explanations is very stereotyped and can be reduced to two versions, one simple, the other more complex. The simple version is of the type: If ( x ), then ( y ), where x designates either a characteristic of the environment or a ‘human’ characteristic (rarely a group of characteristics) which are accorded the status of cause, while y denotes a ‘human’ characteristic (rarely a group of characteristics) deemed to be the effect of the above: for example, if ‘hunting’ ( x ), then ‘cooperation’ ( y ). The complex version includes a complementary proposition in the aforesaid formula, indicating the nature of the relation between the left- hand side ( x ) and the right-hand side ( y ): If ( x ), and if [( x ) → ( y )], then ( y ), where ( x ) and ( y ) have the same values as above, while ( x ) → ( y ) signifies that a characteristic ( x ) commands (leads to, is linked to, necessitates, contributes to, stimulates, liberates, allows, makes possible, etc.) another"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Table  .

For example: If ‘hunting’ ( x ). andif ‘hunting’ requires ‘cooperation’ ( x → y ) then ‘cooperation’ ( y ). So the ‘traditional’ explanations rest on statements that postulate a relation between the characteristics, in which the connection between the left-hand side (cause) and the right-hand side (effect) is sometimes made explicit, sometimes not (a distinction corresponding to that made by Greek rhetoric between syllogism ́ os and epiche ́ ırema ). As we have already observed, this arrangement of characteristics in causal sequences is subject to certain rules and limitations which reflect a particular view of humankind and of culture. The broad lines of this conception can be defined by four axioms that I have called environmental determinism , materialism , utilitarianism and individualism (see chapter  ). Environmental determinism Most of the palaeoanthropological scenarios explain the beginning of hominisation, in its biological and cultural aspects, by the impact of the environment. The influence of the milieu would thus play a key role in triggering the process, the whole of which would be merely the chain of logical consequences of that first impetus. Thereisnoreasontocastdoubtontheimportanceoftheenvironment in the mechanisms of evolution. As to hominisation, the role played by the environment is plausible because the climatic changes of the Plio- Pleistocene are coeval with important evolutionary changes, not just in the hominid family but also for a large part of the flora and fauna of East Africa.  Nonetheless,thiscorrelationdoesnotprejudgethenatureofthe mechanism at work, which might be associated either with new selective pressures, with a reproductive isolation resulting from environmental factors, with both causes working in tandem, or, on another level, with a climatic influence on foetal development.  Furthermore, even if the environment played a decisive part, it would be rushing things to seek to explain hominisation by limiting the spectrum of the hypotheses to external factors, without also taking the structural constraints of the organisms into account.  See, for example, the collected texts in Coppens  .  This last hypothesis, cf. Vrba, Denton and Prentice  ."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Evolutionary mechanisms  The precise character of the influence which the environment has been able to exercise on hominisation cannot therefore be taken for granted. Despite this, our scenarios, which often cast ecological change as a catastrophic event, seem inclined to depict the action of the milieu in terms of the most perfunctory formula: ecological constraints would have traced the straight and narrow path of necessity for the hominids, a single track along which alone the evolutionary process could proceed. So our ancestors would have been faced with a simple choice: to perish or to ‘hominise’ (‘the refusal of some unidentified species to become extinct made possible ... the human condition’, says Robert Ardrey  ). The adoption of such a perspective inevitably affects the explanations put forward: ‘when we ask why this change’, one of our scenarios asserts, ‘we must remember that our ancestors of the time were not striving to becomehuman.Theyweredoingwhatallanimalsdo:tryingtostayalive. Thus, in searching for causes of the change, we must look to conditions pertaining at the time.’  So, to quote a few examples, a meat diet and hunting are perceived as the only chance of survival in a new environment where vegetarian food is sorely lacking; bipedalism is the only form of locomotion conducive to rapid flight and staying alive in an open milieu; tools and cooperation become indispensable, either for defence against more powerful animals or for obtaining the necessary food, etc. Explaining evolutionary transformation would therefore amount to showing how, in given conditions, the change allowed escape from death and the realisation of what is held to be the supreme imperative of the animate world: ‘to stay alive’. This watchword, raised to the status of a law, makes nature the arena of the strictest determinism, in which just one road is open, outside which there is no salvation. Biologists today reject this oversimplistic view. Of course the survival imperative influences living organisms, but it is far from accounting en- tirely for their transformations. From the point of view of the problems of survival, ‘it is difficult’, wrote Fran ̧ cois Jacob, ‘to see any necessity in the fact that trees bear fruit. Or that animals age. Or in sexual- ity. Why should it take two to make a third?’  The demands of the same environment can be met by very different anatomical construc- tionsandbehaviouralresponses;  inotherwords,externalconstraintsare insufficienttoexplaintheoptionsthatwereinfactchosenintheprocessof evolution.  Ardrey  /  :  .  Hockett and Ascher  :  .  Jacob  :  .  Devilliers and Chaline  :  ."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":" Explaining human origins If the axiom of environmental determinism does not meet the com- plexity of evolution, it nevertheless reflects very clearly the simplicity of the common-sense representations. I have already shown in a number of examples that pre-empirical speculation envisaged anthropogenesis as a process subject to a strict inevitability. Holbach became the spokesman for this opinion when he declared: ‘Everything should have convinced man that, at every moment of his existence, he is a passive tool in the hands of necessity ... So it is nature, ever active, that marks each of the points along the line that man must follow.’  From their inception, anthropological conjectures have been accom- panied by the avatars of ecological determinism.  It is striking to ob- serve the lasting success still enjoyed today by theories explaining the diversity of cultures and the important moments in human history by the influence of the natural environment. Their popularity, the faith and trust vested in them, are no smaller in numerous scholarly works than in popular literature; might this once again be the consequence of the weight of the traditional imagery, in which the speculation of Hippocratic theory flourished for so long?  This ancient doctrine pro- posed a symbolic structure, in which, on the four physical qualities, arranged in two pairs of opposites (cold/hot, dry/moist), a whole sys- tem of associations is juxtaposed, including four elements (fire, air, earth, water), four physiological humours (yellow bile, blood, black bile, phlegm) and four temperaments (choleric, brave, melancholic, phleg- matic). Through the medium of climate, food and drink, primitive el- ements were deemed to influence the humours, which governed tem- peraments, and these subsequently determined both the anatomy and the mentality of human beings, their customs and social organisation. Thus the climate, and the food that depends on it, acquired the ex- traordinary and limitless capacity to shape humankind.  And since anatomy, like culture, would be determined by the natural environ- ment, all their transformations would have to be explained by ecological changes. This line of thought, fostered by the writings of Hippocrates, Aristotle and Galen, has long been a strand in western culture. An upsurge in its popularity marked the Renaissance period;  it reached a high point in the eighteenth century and lasted on into the first half of the  Holbach  /  :  .  Greenwood  .  E.g. choice of texts from the Hippocratic corpus, Joly  .  Myers  :  –  ; see also Greenwood  .  E.g.

The influence of the climate;  . Food, which has a great dependence on climate, and  . Manners, on which climate has, perhaps, a still greater in fluence.’  So climate would be the first and principal cause of differentiation of humans and cultures, because it is on climate that the other two causes, food and custom, de- pend. Buffon adds: if ‘the Samoiedes, the Zemblians, the Borandians, the Laplanders, the Greenlanders and the savages to the north of the Esquimaux ... resemble one another in figure, in stature, in colour, in manners and even in singularity of customs’,  it is precisely because they all live in the same climatic zone and consume identical food. Not even the most trivial details of culture escape the impact of a deter- minism so rigorous that it extends to generating identical ‘singularity of customs’. The connection between these speculations and the symbolic system of Hippocratic anthropology is obvious: at least until halfway through the nineteenth century, references to humours and elements can be found in debates on the connections between climate/food and temperament/anatomy/culture.  The success still enjoyed by similar arguments in our own day testifies to how deeply this theory has infiltrated the universe of common sense. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries they are found in the popular literature of countless Universal geographies , which offer colourful descrip- tionsofnationsandethnicgroupswhosecharactersaresaidtohavebeen determined with great precision by local climates.  A veritable arsenal of fanciful images and racist or xenophobic clich ́ es finds a ‘rational’ and ‘scientific’ justification there, reducing the differences between people to differences in climates and geographical situations. This view is still firmly anchored in our contemporary culture, where it is conveyed by products of everyday consumption. Analysis of G ́ erard de Villiers’ SAS  E.g.

Some such principle seems to govern the ‘traditional’ explanations in the hominisa- tion scenarios. Tools, language, cooperation, social life, sexual division of labour, food-sharing appear only under the impact of material circum- stances, which would have entirely determined the life of our ancestors. This view of the origins of culture is not unconnected with a pop- ular theory of ‘human’ nature, clearly expressed by the primatologist  Stomma  .  Ibid.  Marx and Engels  /  :  ."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Evolutionary mechanisms  Adrienne Zihlman in an address to an annual meeting of the American Association of Anthropologists, in which she summed up discussions on the origin of mankind in this sentence: ‘As with most things in life, the de- bate centers on two themes: food and sex; or to give it a proper academic tone: diet and reproduction.’  Whether the tone is academic or not, the idea remains the same and this quote sums it up very well: the human being is first and foremost hunger and the sexual instinct. These are the stimuli that would order its behaviour in the ‘state of nature’ and they are still the prime movers of civilisation. It would be extremely difficult to defend this view on the grounds of ethnological research, where contemporary humans are studied across a multitude of cultures. There we discover humans bogged down every- where in systems of arbitrary conventions imposed on them by society, often running counter to the logic of material constraints. What is more, the human being thinks, so he creates representations of the world that are far from being only a reflection, whether simplified or distorted, of the material universe. Of course, cognition feeds on certain elements of the physical world, but it also has the faculty to generate entities whose existence, although restricted to the realm of imagination, can in turn affect human beings in all the spheres of their lives with as much force as stimuli from the material world. As our scenarios often refer to the cultures of hunter-gatherers, it is worth remembering the impor- tant function of dreams and their interpretations, both influenced by local beliefs, in the lives of these peoples.  Another eloquent example of the role of cognition and social constraints in culture is provided by the phenomenon of the sexual division of labour, reduced by na ̈ ıve an- thropology to biological necessity alone. It is fascinating to observe how vain are the efforts of ethnologists who try to convince their audience that the relation between humans and external reality is mediated by conceptual schemes, that the subjective does not follow from the objec- tive, that cognitive constraints are sometimes as important as material circumstances.  There will be objections that this line of argument is concerned only with contemporary or relatively recent cultures, accessible to direct ob- servation or to historical enquiry.

This ignorance, of course, leaves us free to imagine our ancestors’ existence as reduced to ‘sex’ and ‘food’, but it does not follow that this is the only possible view. There is no obligation to accept a priori a reduction of primitive man to homo stupidus obsessed with the in- cessant quest for food and females; some kind of cultural logic is equally conceivable as a necessary element in the explanation of certain stages of anthropogenesis. Most of our scenarios pass over this eventuality in silence, as if it were indisputable that the explanations not only can but also must restrict themselves to materialist premises. Yet the history of anthropology provides examples of studies that have adopted the opposite point of view, in which thought is considered as the prime mover of hominisation.  In  , K. E. von Baer maintained that upright posture is the consequence of the development of brain and intelligence. In  , a similar hypothesis was put forward by L. F. Ward. W. J. Sollas asserted in  that an intelligent ape with a large brain had chosen the human way of life because he had realised its advantages. In the same spirit, G. E. Smith declared in  that hominisation had started with the development of the brain and the intelligence, and that upright stance and language were merely secondary effects; if the tran- sition from the forest to an open milieu seemed to be the key moment for this process, the only reason for it, according to Smith, was that our ancestors, having become intelligent, understood the superiority of life in the new milieu. Clearly, this type of reasoning can easily be transformed into an all- purpose explanation that will lend itself to every situation. Humans ‘un- derstood’ or ‘decided’ – just one act of the intellect and the will provides all the explanations you want, as easy to make up as they are difficult to refute. The ‘materialist’ school of anthropology, aware of these weak- nesses, rejected this procedure. The materialist search for causes was intended to supply the alternative solution, as Engels emphasised when he wrote that ‘it is to the mind, to the development and activity of the brain that all the credit for the swift development of society must be at- tributed;mengrewaccustomedtoexplainingtheiractivitybytheirthink- ing rather than by their needs ... the result of this was that, with time, the idealist world-view emerged, which, particularly since the decline  Cf.

This kind of view still pre- vails, so that even materialist scholars of the Darwinian school could not always get a clear idea of the origin of man.’  Yet Engels was wrong when he claimed the materialist approach as a nineteenth-century innovation; anthropological speculation had been using it constantly since Antiquity. The ‘materialist’ and the ‘idealist’ ex- planatory formulae alike belong to the longue dur ́ ee structures of western thought: although contradictory, the two remain paradoxically linked, heirs to the same anthropological view, which we might call the concep- tion of ‘stratified man’. In both cases the human being is conceived as a creature with strata, consisting principally of two layers. One is natural, physical, biologi- cal, animal, material, instinctive and predictable. The other is cultural, suprabiological, human, moral and cognitive, therefore arbitrary and unpredictable. The demarcation line separating them is presented as clear and easily discernible. The layers are superimposed in such a way that one forms a plinth, while the other is the pinnacle. Consequently, all that remains is to decide which of these strata is fundamental: either thought–culture has pride of place and decides about materiality–nature or the reverse. This is the essence of the old anthropological debate be- tween ‘idealism’ and ‘materialism’. It is the materialist option rooted in the old naturalist tradition that dominatesinourpalaeoanthropologicalscenarios.Anthropologicalcon- jecturesoftheeighteenthandearlynineteenthcenturiesagainandagain alluded to the ‘stratified man’, in which the natural layer appeared as the base for the cultural layer. ‘We are born, so to speak, apes, it is education that makes us men’, wrote J.-J. Virey.  In Diderot, this on- togenetic summary was echoed in a historical development: ‘There ex- isted a natural man: into that man an artificial man was introduced.’  Still according to Diderot, the ancient fundamental layer lies buried in civilised man, but it can get the upper hand again in difficult circum- stances which ‘return man to his early simplicity, reducing him to the constraints of the most elementary needs’.  So, faced with the men- ace and hardships of the struggle for existence, humankind regresses to its animal dimension; and no one should be surprised, since the strata are distinct and the base level can exist in isolation from its pinnacle. There is thus no doubt, Conjectural History asserted, that in earliest times, everyone was entirely engaged in the ‘vital struggle’ (the term  Engels  /  :  .  Virey  :  .  Diderot  /  :  .  Ibid ."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":" Explaining human origins used by the Enlightenment when speaking of what was later called the ‘struggle for survival’) and human nature, subject to primary needs, was limited to its fundamental layer. Philosophers of every age delight in discovering this popular wisdom, according to which, in the beginning, mankind was reduced to digestion and sex. So Engels, in his funeral eulogy for Karl Marx, paid tribute to his master and friend, saying that ‘just as Charles Darwin discovered the law of the development of the organic world, so Marx discovered this simple fact, shrouded un- til then by ideological biases, that human beings must first eat, drink and find shelter before they can indulge in politics, science, art, religion, etc.’  Two hundred years earlier, Giambattista Vico had made a similar ‘discovery’: ‘humans are first of all in search of what is necessary for life; after that they seek useful things, the comforts of life, then they yearn for pleasure.’  The idea that leisure and release from material preoccupations are necessary before humans can rise to activities going beyond their ele- mentary needs had already been widely accepted since Antiquity.  It would be just as easy to amass references in support of the opposite con- ception, equally ancient and widespread, that gives priority in humans and in culture to the ‘moral’ and ‘cognitive’ layer alone. Consequently, what must be borne in mind is the favour enjoyed among philosophers and scholars alike by the view of man as ‘stratified’ and capable of being ‘dismantled’, in either of these versions. The basic scheme is in perfect harmony with the traditional anthropological thesis. In Christian theology, in gnostic and cabbalistic speculations, as in other esoteric currents, the human being is made up of two parts, different in nature, either of which may achieve mastery of him: soul and body, New Man and Old Man, pneuma and anti-mimon pneuma , the holy soul ( nischmata ) and the bestial soul ( n ́ephesch haˆ ıa ), etc. The words of Faust spring to mind, when he cries out in tragic desolation: Two souls, alas! reside within my breast, And each withdraws from, and repels, its brother.  The idea of this duality in humans still persists in our contemporary culture, where it takes the most varied forms. Not only does a good deal of literature tell us of the eternal struggle being fought out deep within us between the Beast and the Angel, but certain scientists declare from time to time that they have just discovered an ancient, forgotten residue  Engels  :  .  Vico  /  :  , paragraph L .

The theory of the ‘stratified man’ is heavy with consequences for the explanations of anthropogenesis, since it authorises the breaking down of the human being into layers or levels for which independent modes of functioning are envisaged. It is then deemed necessary to reduce humankind to characteristics derived from just one of those levels and to explain anthropological phenomena in terms of the monovalent logic peculiar to such a level, that is, either by purely cognitive operations or, as in our palaeoanthropological scenarios, by material constraints alone. Utilitarianism To explain the origin of new characteristics in terms of the principle of utilitarianism means showing in what way an innovation was useful. In our scenarios, such a procedure implies a particular view of usefulness, adapted to the image we have made of our ancestors’ life. As most of the authors lean to the belief that primitive existence consisted chiefly of a struggle for survival, they attribute a usefulness for safeguarding life to the first human characteristics to emerge at the beginning of hominisation. If hunting appears, it is because it alone allowed enough food to be found in the savannah; social life was vital in order to face up tothemortaldangerfrompredators;toolswereessentialfordefence,etc. Thus, in the beginning, usefulness would derive from absolute necessity. Then, with time, these first ‘human’ characteristics bring about the need for other innovations: language is essential for transmitting technical skills; cooperation is necessary when hunting, which in turn implies the usefulness of a sexual division of labour, which then makes food-sharing necessary. Anotionofusefulnessreducedinthiswaytotheelementarynecessities is typical of ‘traditional’ explanations, and fits in well with their deter- minist principles. So it is rare for usefulness to be invoked in connection with a mere benefit, possible but not essential (for example the merit of bipedalism to facilitate observation in the savannah; the advantage of tools for swifter butchering of carcasses).

However, the essential problem faced by the palaeoanthropologists is not only how to recognise clearly the exact nature of the usefulness that can be referred to in the explanations; it is chiefly a matter of deciding whether invoking usefulness is sufficient, or even necessary, to explain the origin of things. Emile Durkheim was already recommending ex- treme prudence in this respect and his remarks have lost none of their topicality: Making plain the usefulness of a fact is not the same as explaining how it arose or how it is what it is. For the uses to which it can be put imply speci fic properties that characterise it but do not create it. Our need for things cannot make them be this or that and, consequently, it is not need that can draw them out of nothingness and confer being on them.  Yet explanation by usefulness, or better still by necessity, remains a popular and a priori credible procedure. ‘The old maxim “necessity is the mother of invention” is quite applicable to both the human and the later Neolithic revolutions’, a commentator on Hockett and Ascher’s paper confidently declares, so giving an accurate picture of the explanatory principleputforwardintheirtext.  ‘Needisthefatherofthearts’,wrote J.-J.

Marx and Engels made the same rule the basis of their understanding of history, stating that ‘any revolution and the results that are its outcome were determined by the conditions of existence of the individuals, by needs’.  Explanation of genesis by needs was a commonplace already in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Hobbes spoke then of ‘need, the mother of all inventions’, and Goguet echoed him later calling need ‘the master and tutor of men’.  Diodorus Siculus, in the first pages of his Universal History , was already using those words (‘need has been the master of men’  ), and the same idea was put to the task by the Fathers of the Church: ‘God’, wrote Origen, ‘wishing human intelligence to be  Durkheim  /  :  .  Livingstone  :  .  Virey  , I :  .  Marx and Engels  /  :  .  Hobbes  /  :  , Ch.

Let us rather reflect that the same theme is still widespread in scholarly anthropology as well: elementary needs are assigned such a large part in culture that they are believed to be sufficient to elucidate its genesis.  Explanation by usefulness is itself very useful, since it enables us to explainpracticallyeverything.Itiseasytoattributesomekindoffunction to everything that exists, especially to past phenomena, of which traces arefragmentaryandknowledgeisuncertain.Thewritingsofethnologists show that this formula is applied just as commonly in the interpretation of contemporary cultures, even though the data available on the subject are richer and should impose stronger empirical constraints.  When we accept the theory that everything that exists is useful and that, if something exists, it is because it is useful, the task of etiological explanation becomes child’s play: if we want to understand a charac- teristic, a phenomenon, an event, we need only give it a function. We are reminded of Metternich: ‘I wonder’, he is supposed to have said on learning that the Tsar of Russia was dead, ‘what can have been his motive?’  Origen  , II :  , IV .  .  Histoire raisonn ́ ee , for its part, assimilated the notion of necessity to that of needs, which were contrasted with desires. In earliest times, the needs of man would have been limited to the simple necessities of biological existence and it was only later, with the development of culture, that the list of elementary needs would have been enriched with superfluous desires whose powerful presence henceforth had an influence on the vicissitudes of human history (for example Burnet  –  :  ; Delam ́ ethrie  : liv; Lac ́ ep` ede  :  ; Virey  , II :  ).  Thediscussionsonthesocialorganisationofhunter-gatherersinparticularareagoodillustration of the mechanism of explanation by usefulness. Take, for example, the debate on the rules for postmarital residence. The traditional explication (e.g. Service  :  ) holds that all hunting peoples are patrilocal, since, by allowing the solidarity between men of the same group to be preserved, that system is useful for hunting activities, the sharing of meat and war. Yet it turns out that some groups of hunter-gatherers, quite a lot in fact, especially among the Northern Athabascans (Canada) are matrilineal. Why? The explanation of this phenomenon, the opposite of the previous one, also appeals to usefulness. R. J. Perry (  :  ) proposes the following argument: since men spend their time hunting in small bands, the base camp, inhabited chiefly by women, becomes the main setting for social life. So it is important that friendship and harmony reign there. The rule of matrilocality, then, was established so as to regroup women of the same origin together. With that kind of reasoning, it is easy to ‘explain’ any cultural phenomenon and, by the same token, its opposite, because the usefulness of either can be imagined in a flash."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":" Explaining human origins Individualism ‘The proper study of mankind is man’: this famous line by Alexander Pope, quoted at the head of a work by Cabanis,  could also be the motto for the ‘traditional’ explanations. Because if the origin of the char- acteristics of human beings can be explained by their needs, these are no more than individual. ‘Culture grows out of the activity and needs of individuals’, we read in a hominisation scenario.  The dialectic of conflict between individual needs and those of the social group is missing from this type of explanatory reasoning. Society, our authors maintain, is formed to satisfy the needs of the individual; so how could it not be sub- ject to the latter’s demands? Emile Durkheim gave a penetrating analysis of the close link that exists between the principles of utilitarianism and of individualism: Indeed, if society is just a system of means instituted by humans in order to achievecertainends,thoseendscannotbutbeindividual;for,beforesociety,only individualscouldexist.Soitisfromtheindividualthatemanatetheneedswhich have determined the formation of societies, and if it is from him that everything comes, it is through him that everything necessarily must be explained.  Now, according to Auguste Comte whose ideas are the target of Durkheim’s criticism, ‘social facts would derive so immediately from human nature that, during the earliest phases of history, they could be deduced directly from it, without any recourse to observation’.  The‘traditional’explanationsusedinalmostthreequartersofourcausal sequencesshowastrongresemblancetothoseofna ̈ ıveanthropology.The principlesof environmental determinism , materialism , utilitarianism and individu- alism establishapparentlysolidbasesfordeductivereasoning.Theirstrict application reduces mankind and culture to what is thought to be a ‘nat- ural’ dimension, in which the causes of the phenomena studied could be inferred directly from the ‘laws of nature’.

Thus the aim was to satisfy the crucial condition for telling history backwards, of which Kant spoke in these terms: But if we were to start reconstructing history entirely on conjectures, we would be doing little more, it seems to me, than sketching out a novel.

The four principles I have just reviewed are the axioms of this view; their usefulness is consequently beyond question in any attempt at deductive reconstruction of prehistory.

I began this chapter by indicating that ‘traditional’ explanations es- tablish relationships between ‘human’ and ‘ecological’ characteristics and give them a causal status. For the present, having analysed the rules governing these relationships, I can pinpoint the standard pro- cedure of the palaeoanthropological scenarios: to explain the origin of a new human characteristic y by the previous existence of characteristic x (the sequence x → y ) is to state that, in the presence of x , y becomes necessary or useful for the survival and subsistence of the individual, whoseelementaryneedsaredeterminedbytheconstraintsof thenatural environment. ‘ LAMARCKIAN ’ EXPLANATIONS The arguments based on ‘Lamarckian’ premises persisted in anthropol- ogy into the second half of the  s, surrounded, paradoxically, by the  Kant  /  :  ."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":" Explaining human origins aura of a classic Darwinian theme, Darwin’s ‘Lamarckian’ hypothesis concerning canine teeth reduction having become particularly popular.

According to the maxims that then summarised the general viewofnature,it‘abhorsavacuum’,‘doesnothinginvain’,‘doesnothing superfluous’. It goes without saying that in such a world, usefulness is the first raison d’ˆ etre , while lack of usefulness becomes a death sentence. Kant wrote: An organ that does not have to be used, a conf ormation that does not ful fil its objective is a contradiction in the teleological doctrine of nature. Indeed if we depart from this principle, we are no longer dealing with a nature that obeys laws but with a nature that operates with no purpose, and a distressing indeterminism takes the place of the vital lead of reason.  The principle of use and disuse meets perfectly the demands of the ‘naturalorder’establishedbytheArchitectoftheUniverseinaccordance  Lamarck  , I :  .  Ardrey  /  :  .  Engels  /  :  .  Diderot  /  :  .  Kant  /  :  ."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Evolutionary mechanisms  with the immutable logic of universal laws.

It is fascinating to see the extent to which the ‘Lamarckian’ view of usefulness agrees with the ‘traditional’ explanations of common-sense anthropology, which for centuries has been making usefulness the very principle of its explanatory reasonings. In both cases, external circum- stances determine needs, needs decide on the nature of the usefulness, and everything that comes into being finds its explanation in usefulness. The theory common to both na ̈ ıve anthropology and ‘Lamarckism’ is that the genesis of things is the genesis of their usefulness. ‘ DARWINIAN ’ EXPLANATIONS I have agreed to designate as ‘Darwinian’ any explanation showing some rhetoric or lexical sign of a possible connection with the theory of evo- lution, whether Darwinian or synthetic.

Although this definition is very wide, the number of ‘Darwinian’ types of explanation in our corpus does not exceed  per cent, and half the scenarios offer no trace of it at all (Table  ). Yet all our authors – with the exception, of course, of Lamarck – accepted the Darwinian theory ( sensu lato ) unreservedly, declaring more than once that its principles must lie at the base of evolutionary explanations. If they state their attachment to Darwinism in this way, and subsequently make only modest use of it, it is perhaps because their vision of Darwinism is very specific and deviates from the definition I have chosen.

In order to attempt an answer, let us examine the concrete uses made of Darwinian concepts. Natural selection Natural selection is the paramount notion of ‘Darwinian’ explanations in our scenarios. To explain the origin of an organ, of a function, of a type of behaviour or of an artefact is to indicate the selective pressure responsible for propagating it. The general pattern of the causal chains is as follows: when certain characteristics or states appear ( x ), they imply the action of natural se- lection which begins to favour other properties ( y ). For example, it is as- sumed that the emergence of sexual division of labour and food-sharing ( x )inturnactivatesnaturalselectionwhichfavourstheemergenceoffam- ily organisation ( y ).  In certain cases, this kind of succinct explanation is expanded by a proposition establishing a functional relation between x and y . Kim Hill’s scenario offers a typical example: the hominids, the author imagines, started eating meat, but their digestive system was not producing the enzymes that usually aid the assimilation of flesh in other carnivores. Consequently, long and tedious mastication was required, which was decidedly difficult. Strong incisors and large molars then be- came useful to facilitate mastication; so natural selection favoured the development of just such dentition.  What is it that is being favoured here? Something that is useful. The functional relation between x and y comes down to the usefulness of y in relation to x . By extension of this argument, it is accepted that if selection favours a , and if b is useful for a , selection must favour b equally. For example, when natural selection promotes reciprocal aid between brothers and sisters, and if the learning of mutual aid from the mother helps to reinforce this mutual assistance, then natural selection also favours the development of that learning.  So selection is a direct support of what is useful and an indirect support of what is useful to what is useful. What is the nature of this usefulness? Notably useful is anything that: (a) ensures better access to food;  (b) allows food to be obtained at the maximal possible rate;  (c) allows maximisation of the yield (in calories/hour) from the effort invested in foraging.   Isaac  a:  .  Hill  :  –  .  Tanner and Zihlman  :  .  Hill  :  .  Kurland and Beckerman  :  .  Hill  :  ."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Evolutionary mechanisms  So, the notion of usefulness comes down to efficiency in the quest for food. This finding is revealing. Since our authors accept, in accordance with the rules of Darwinian theory, that natural selection gives advan- tage to characteristics favourable to reproductive success, they go on to reason as if ability to reproduce were limited only by alimentary prob- lems. And we are back again to the traditional view of nature, in which lack of food is the only worry for all creatures, and the course of evolu- tion is governed by the struggle for food. This view alone could justify assimilating the action of selection solely to the problems of obtaining food. Fitness The same principle seems to govern the use of the term fitness. Con- sider, for example, the explanation proposed by Kim Hill’s scenario. Male-hunter hominids were able to obtain food more efficiently than the female-gatherers, and so they had some free time; they devoted this leisure–supposedlyunknownuntilthen–toincreasetheirfitness:taking advantage of their free time, they hunted more and so obtained a sur- plus of meat, which they then exchanged for additional copulations with females.  Leaving aside this singular and unverifiable idea of primeval prostitu- tion, it seems surprising that fitness should be determined exclusively by the amount of time free from subsistence activities, which would have been lacking before the emergence of hunting. Here again appears the oldideaofthe‘franticsearchforfood’,supposedtodominatetheoriginal human existence. Adaptation According to our scenarios, if a characteristic displays adaptation in rela- tion to another characteristic, that simply means that the first presents a certain usefulness in relation to the second. Bipedalism is an adaptation to open country, adopted because this locomotion was useful for getting about in that environment.  Reduction in anterior tooth size is an adap- tation to chewing vegetable food, because the anterior teeth, when re- duced, are useful for that task.  A large oral cavity is an adaptation to the prolonged chewing of plant food because it is useful for it,  etc.  Ibid .:  .  Oakley  :  ; Washburn  :  .  Jolly  :  .  Ibid ."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":" Explaining human origins Sincethepublicationof G.C.Williams’ Adaptation and natural selection ,  which has become a classic, we are aware of the ambivalence of the term ‘adaptation’ and the tautological traps to which casual users of it may be exposed. By assimilating adaptation to usefulness, and usefulness to natural selection, the hominisation scenarios provide a good illustration of this. The basic reasoning is as follows: since natural selection favours only adaptive characteristics and since natural selection is the only force responsible for the proliferation of new characteristics, everything that is propagated in nature is adaptive: ‘all existing features of animals are adaptative. If they were not adaptative, then they would be eliminated by selection and would disappear.’  If everything is adaptative, it follows that everything is useful, because only useful features – according to our scenarios – are adaptative. The teleological doctrine seems to govern everything in this particular version of ‘Darwinism’, exactly like in ‘traditional’ and ‘Lamarckian’ explanations. Sociobiology and optimisation models It is worth emphasising the role played in ‘Darwinian’ explanations by the formulae that appeal to the principles of sociobiology and to optimisation models (for example Optimal Foraging Theory). Sociobiological theory and optimisation models are not inseparable but they are often applied jointly, combining their main concepts: that of inclusive fitness and of optimisation (or maximisation). Both concepts relate to natural selection. According to sociobiology, selection favours inclusive fitness, that is the properties of the organism that are useful not only for increasing its own chances of survival and reproduction, but also for ensuring that parents carrying similar genetic information have the same opportunities.  According to the premises of Optimal Foraging Theory, natural selection should favour anything that allows maximisation or optimisation of yield from the effort invested in obtain- ing food. The principles of the two theories can operate separately, with the concept of natural selection as their common base; they can also be combined, the inclusive fitness of sociobiology becoming the objective of optimisation. However the concept of fitness is defined (individual or collective), natural selection can sometimes be considered as a process aimed at optimising or maximising fitness.   Williams  ; see also Gould and Lewontin  .  W.

Keene, a representative of that trend, was well aware – it soon took the form of a belief in an omnipresent and omnipotent optimisation: ‘Optimal behaviour is adaptive behaviour; all creatures optimise, and it is our task to figure out what they are optimising. Archaeologists working with these methods have tended to find optimisation lurking behind every artefact.’  A similar orientation is displayed in some of our scenarios as well. The authors who invoke optimisation seem convinced that early hominids were tending to go that way, and they consider this premise to be the solid foundation of deductive inferences, regardless of the fact that the optimisation models are only applicable in particular conditions.  A. S. Keene was justifiably amazed at the success achieved by his colleagues and himself in trying to demonstrate that prehistoric hunter- gatherers optimised the use of resources.  Their success is less surprising whenwetakeintoaccounttheconvergencebetweensomeoftheassump- tions of these models and the schemes of na ̈ ıve anthropology.

In spite of the terminological and theoretical innovations peculiar to this type of explanation, the mechanism envisaged remains very similar to that underlying other ‘Darwinian’ formulae: fierce competition rules the search for food which is always too scarce, and omnipresent selection favours anything that is useful in that struggle. The chief modification concerns a widening of the field of usefulness: what was difficult to understand with reference to individual usefulness alone (for example altruism or reciprocal aid) becomes now explained through usefulness to the group.

That is just another way of saying that ‘( x ) causes ( y )’, since nat- ural selection is held responsible for every widespread form or func- tion. The explanation by natural selection (adaptation, advantage for fitness) is modelled on the traditional explanation by usefulness. So, in order to be ‘Darwinian’, it is enough to reuse the explanatory pattern of na ̈ ıve anthropology, taking care to replace the vague notion of ‘cause’ by that of natural selection, both of them associated with the notion of usefulness. Let there be no misunderstanding: none of this means that I con- sider Darwinian theory to be a rhetorical device based on a sim- ple modification of vocabulary.

Third, even these simplistic arguments can occasionally provide perfectly acceptable hypotheses, particularly when these have verifiable implications. My conclusion is, in fact, limited to showing that the explanatory for- mulae keep returning, throughout the two hundred years or so covered by our scenarios, to the same premises, the very ones that na ̈ıve anthro- pology has been using for two millennia. Although these assumptions may occasionally lead to reasonable hypotheses, they have the draw- back of always generating the same explanations of evolutionary change and of ignoring several other equally plausible ones. I am not claiming, therefore, to put my finger on explanations that are necessarily ‘wrong’, although there may be errors, but rather to highlight a conditioning that limits the variability of hypotheses and reduces them to a simple pattern, the main features of which I have tried to define.

In the ‘Darwinian’ version, that aspect remains dominant, even if a new kind of usefulness is invoked, for reproduction, which na ̈ ıve anthropology neglects.

Thacker’s critical edition of Candide  ). For example, according to Boyle, if cats have pupils with a vertical slit, it is because they feed mainly on rats and mice which ‘are animals that normally move up and down walls and other steep places, and the most convenient situation for the pupils [of cats], so as to detect those objects swiftly and follow them, is to be vertical’.  The Abb ́ e Pluche tried to elucidate the phenomenon of tides from the fact that they are useful to ships, which, thanks to them, can enter port more easily. F ́ enelon explained the degree of fluidity of water by its usefulness for supporting vessels without impeding their progress, and went into raptures about the fact that cattle and sheep are always more numerous than bears and wolves: ‘Is it not wonderful that the most useful animals should also be the most prolific?’  ThePanglossian metaphysico-theologo-cosmolo-nigological doctrine may indeed seem laughable but its continuing popularity is less so. Even Voltaire – author of Candide – was unable to free himself from the hold of that explanatory procedure he had been so prone to criticise, as can be seen in his essays on histoire raisonn ́ ee that I have already mentioned. In that, Voltaire, as much as the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century naturalists and philosophers, was merely carrying on an old tradition of Western thought. Was not Origen already saying that ‘everything was created for its use’?  It is strange that this idea should remain so persistent, not only in the palaeoanthropological scenarios analysed here, but more generally across the human sciences. The conviction that everything can be explained by its usefulness for some purpose seems to be a characteristic feature of our intellectual tradition: from the Old Testament Job who pondered on the function of his sufferings, seeking to understand the reason for them, right across theological and naturalist doctrines to modern folklore conceptions, such as the conspiracy theo- ries that are so often used nowadays to explain historical events by their usefulness to some Machiavellian plan.  The simplicity of the explanation by usefulness is very attractive, and its vacuity is rarely perceived clearly.

But can that usefulness explain the genesis of the sutures? Darwin answers no, for the same sutures exist in the cranium of young birds and young reptiles that need only emerge from a broken egg.  This example shows that too mechanical a transition from useful- ness to the ‘cause’ can easily lead to important errors. Important, but none the less ‘convincing’, which means that explanation by usefulness can retain its status as an a priori credible formula, so much so that our palaeoanthropological scenarios even make it the cornerstone of their arguments. With or without Darwinian rhetoric, everything can be explained along that track. This power should be worrying, but it is rather the opposite that occurs and many researchers treat that feat as a quality. In this regard, we cannot but be struck by Nobel prize- winner Peter Medawar’s slip of the pen when he sought to defend the theory of evolution in these words: ‘It is too difficult to imagine or en- visage an evolutionary episode which could not be explained by the formula of Neo-Darwinism.’  Indeed, explanations in line with a cer- tain Darwinian scheme are a magic key that opens every door; and since it would be impossible – in Medawar’s words – to imagine a lock that the key would not fit, it could be inferred that the ‘utilitarian’ formula is virtually tautological. One way of justifying the traditional procedure might be that the ex- planations by usefulness must necessarily be the rule, simply because they are the only ones conceivable. Everything that exists would be, one way or another, useful for something, on pain of slipping back into nothingness; so any etiological explanation must imply some useful- ness, and the only problem is to determine the nature of that usefulness correctly. Are we obliged to bow the knee to this assumption? Does it match the mechanisms of evolution, or those that rule our thought, impeded by an imperfect view of nature?

Darwin was already trying to correct this mistaken view,  but it slipped quickly into common use, where it was made into either an unjust objection to the theory of evolution, or, more often, the guid- ing principle for hypotheses that, rightly or wrongly, claimed to be Darwinian. The theory of evolution itself progressed along more and more sophisticated lines, always finding some alternative to explanations by usefulness, without, quite obviously, denying it some role in its view of nature. We shall now examine some of these complementary options, as they are presented in recent literature, including, in some cases, our palaeoanthropological scenarios. The stratigraphy of functions A first alternative, proposed by Stephen J. Gould and Elisabeth Vrba,  attempts to build a bridge between conventional explanation and ver- sions that might remedy some of its deficiencies. The authors acknowl- edge the plausibility of explanations by usefulness: it is obvious that the process of natural selection fashions certain features in accordance with their usefulness at the time. Thus, with the example of bipedal- ism, it is possible that our ancestors became bipeds because natural selection favoured that type of locomotion, for the same advantages – such as the ability to carry objects in the hands – that we still en- joy today. But it is equally legitimate to think, as do Gould and Vrba, that a characteristic’s present function has nothing whatever to do with its genesis, which may have been linked to another function, now vanished. This version is still not very far removed from the classic positions. The only difference consists in making a clear distinction between a for- mer usefulness, responsible for the genesis (adaptation), and a current usefulness (exaptation). Darwin was aware of this possible ‘stratigraphy’ of functions, but he only evoked it to reply to critics who stressed the existence of characteristics apparently devoid of ‘usefulness’.  The bio- logical literature of our own day often deals with a similar phenomenon under the term ‘preadaptation’, and one of our scenarios does indeed bring this concept into play. It presents the reduction of anterior tooth size as an adaptation (original usefulness) to the mastication of grass seeds or annual herbs, and the freeing of the hands as an adaptation to gathering; these two features are deemed to become later, in the course  Darwin  :  –  .  Gould and Vrba  .  Darwin  :  –  ."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Evolutionary mechanisms  of hominisation, a preadaptation (secondary usefulness) to the use of tools.  In the same way, a large oral cavity and a muscular and mobile tonguewould,inthefirstplace,havebeenanadaptationtotheprolonged chewing of food and would subsequently have assumed the character of an exaptation to the use of articulate speech  (these features had been ‘preadaptive’ to ... ). The concept of exaptation, used in this sense, corresponds therefore to that of preadaptation. Yet a new term was essential – Gould and Vrba argue  – in order to take a second type of exaptation into account, one that dissociates genesis from usefulness. In the process of evolution, the reason why a feature is propagated may be independent, not only of sec- ondary usefulness, observed at present, but also of any former function. It is possible that certain conformations proliferate totally unconnected with usefulness (‘nonaptive’ features in the authors’ terminology). This eventuality requires us to envisage entities subject to evolution as if they were systems composed of ‘communicating parts’. Communicating parts Therearetwoexplanatoryformulasthatallowgenesisandfunctiontobe separated either partially or completely. They both rely on notions that I shall call, for the convenience of this brief account, the conception of ‘communicating characteristics’ and the conception of ‘communicating levels’. Our scenarios define human beings, the end result of hominisation, by a list of very distinct characteristics. A particular usefulness is sub- sequently attributed to each of them in order to explain their origin. And yet these conformations can also be envisaged in the form of ‘com- municating vessels’, in which the change undergone in one part brings about transformations in some of the others. The idea is hardly new. Darwin mentions it under the name of ‘correlation of growth’, which for him becomes one of the three main sources of change, alongside natural selection and the principle of use and disuse  (nowadays terms are pleiotropic mechanisms or allometric phenomenon  ). Thereafter, if certain parts are correlated (the mechanism involved is another prob- lem), natural selection, acting on one of them because of its usefulness, may change others whether useful or not.  Jolly  :  –  .  Ibid .  Gould and Vrba  :  .  Darwin  :  ,  .  E.g.

We find it in Sherwood Washburn’s text;  he associates reduction in the ridges of bone over the eyes and a decrease in the shelf of bone in the neck area with the suppression of aggressive behaviour in our ancestors. Natu- ral selection is thought to have underpinned endocrinological changes whichcontributedtorestrictingaggressivenesswithintheearliesthuman groups; certain ‘non-utilitarian’ transformations in the morphology of the cranium would have resulted as a secondary effect. Likewise, the re- ductioninthebonybirthcanal,asecondaryresultofbipedallocomotion and upright posture, would have had no usefulness in itself.  A. Leroi-Gourhan’s scenario provides another example of a similar explanatory formula. Upright posture, a first cause – it appears, inciden- tally, like a deus ex machina – is thought to set in motion a whole chain of morphological transformations in human ancestors. Their skeleton is thought of as a structure in dynamic equilibrium, in which change in one part must lead to modification in others linked to it, and sub- ject to the same system of mechanical constraints. Leaving aside the initial stimulus and its function, the explanation of the other changes, that follow almost automatically, does without any references in Leroi- Gourhan to natural selection and usefulness, even though it is true that any new characteristic may acquire a practical significance with time.  This type of explanation is curiously rare in our scenarios, despite the fact that the ‘communicating parts’ concept has led to some verifiable hypotheses. For example, S. J. Gould and D. Pilbeam obtained positive results by applying the data test to the hypothesis which linked the differ- entiation of cranial capacity in the Australopithecines to differences in the size of the body.  Positive results are also mentioned in connection with the hypothesis relating to the cause of the reduction in canine di- morphism and canine size in Australopithecus afarensis ; these are attributed to selection favouring the growth of the occlusal surface of the premo- lars, to the detriment of the space available for the development of late erupting canine teeth.  Another way of avoiding explanation by usefulness is to resort to the conception of ‘communicating levels’.

Sociobiology speaks of selection at group level but it can also be thought of at the level of the genome, the population or the species.  In order for natural selection to come into play, it is enough for the following factors to come together:  . Variation: different entities in a population have different character- istics (morphological, physiological, behavioural, etc.).  . Reproduction: different characteristics have different rates of repro- duction and survival.  . Heredity: the characteristics are transmitted from one generation to the next.  These three conditions are fulfilled at each level of organisation of living matter, the respective stages of which fit together to form a hier- archical system. Thus the domain of natural selection can be widened to open the way to broader views of the possible connections between usefulness and the genesis of new characteristics. The hierarchical conception avoids, in particular, arbitrary assimila- tion of the selective value of a characteristic, expressed by the repro- duction and survival rates, to its usefulness for the individual situated in a given milieu. If it is assumed that the hierarchical levels are inter- connected, selection that favours a certain characteristic on one level because of its usefulness, may at the same time, on other levels, give rise to a non-utilitarian sorting of other characteristics. It is logical, for example, that the selection responsible for eliminating certain organ- isms should proceed at the same time to a sorting of genomes, but it is equally possible that the selection favourable to certain characteristics of the genome may give rise to a sorting of organisms. And it may also happen that what is useful for the genome is not useful for its bearer. For example, the sperm of the house mouse contains a total  per cent of t -allele, although at the level of the organism that is disadvantageous, since male homozygotes bearing two t -alleles are sterile. The strong t -allele content in the sperm would be explained by the support this allele receives through the selection present at the level of the genome.   E.g.

Gould pro- posed replacing the general notion of selection by the following two terms:  . Sorting, that is the differential birth and death among varying entities (without prejudging its ‘cause’);  . Selection, that is a particular kind of sorting that appears in the in- teraction with the environment and which always remains linked to a direct or indirect usefulness for reproduction.  The distinction is important, for if it is true that there is no selection without sorting, it is also true that there can be sorting without selec- tion. In fact, as the levels are connected, selection on one of them is capable of causing sorting on another. This kind of sorting may cause conformations to be propagated that have no connection either to the environment or to any usefulness. Selection that operates on lower levels may lead to sorting on higher levels and vice versa. In the first case, Gould and Vrba speak of an ‘ascending causality’, and in the other of a ‘descending causality’.  An asymmetry exists between them: descend- ing causality is inescapable, ascending causality is possible. For example, the propagation or extinction of a species always goes hand in hand with the proliferation or disappearance of the genomes carried by the species, whereas the development of repetitive DNAs may, it seems, have no influence on the phenotypes of the organisms or on what the species become.  Thus the conception of ‘communicating levels’ separates genesis from usefulness, without, however, entirely abolishing their connection. Cer- tain new characteristics may be propagated thanks to a non-utilitarian sorting, which still remains an effect, albeit an indirect one, of selection, linked with usefulness. It could even be said that the utilitarian reference is thus reinforced: certain genetic mutations, for example, considered random till now and so independent of usefulness, could now be treated as the result of the utilitarian selection taking place at the level of the genome; so those mutations would only be ‘random’ from the point of view of the higher level, that of the whole organism.  It is none the less true that the conception of ‘communicating lev- els’ puts an end to the harmonious coexistence between genesis and  Vrba and Gould  :  .  See examples in Vrba and Gould  .  Orgel and Crick  ; Doolittle and Sapienza  .  Vrba and Gould  :  ."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Evolutionary mechanisms  usefulness. Natural selection, set in motion on one level, may cause, on other levels, the proliferation of characteristics that do not have to prove their usefulness in a confrontation with the environment. That being so, we can conceive of the existence of conformations that are widespread but lacking in usefulness. The latter thus keeps its status of ‘first cause’ but the explanations are not necessarily obliged to appeal to it. Nor need the constituting of the human organism, the genesis of which our scenarios are endeavouring to elucidate, inevitably come back to the ac- cumulation of characteristics useful for survival and reproduction. We are equally entitled to envisage it rather as the result of a compromise of several Darwinian effects occurring in parallel on different levels. The fact that we can assign a usefulness to each characteristic does not necessarily mean that we have understood the reason for its genesis: originally, these new characteristics could just as easily be useless and merely constitute a ‘raw material’ for the secondary uses that made its exaptations. These remarks on natural selection invite further reflection on expla- nations by usefulness that are still so often employed in ethnology. Can these alternative formulas explain phenomena of a non-biological or- der? We might have reason to be wary of this kind of transplantation and its results. The na ̈ ıve uses of Darwinism applied to culture, which make it an object shaped by natural selection, have a long history and their biases are well known; they are often so serious that the memory of them causes misgivings when we have to remind ourselves that selection processes are nevertheless well and truly at work in the social realm. There is nothing really surprising in that, even so, for the products of culture perfectly fulfil the three conditions necessary for generating a selection process, though not necessarily a natural one.

So we are justified in conceiving of certain facts of culture as the results of a selection. Far from wishing to initiate yet another debate on a possible theory of culture, my intention is simply to show that there exist alternative formulas to common-sense explanations of anthropogenesis. The con- ception of ‘communicating levels’ as well as the concepts of ‘selection’ and ‘sorting’, borrowed from biology, offer just such a possibility. No one will dispute the legitimacy of considering cultural entities as systems of hierarchical levels, comprising strata like the individual, the family, the"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":" Explaining human origins local group, the regional group, the connubium, the linguistic group, etc. Selection, favouring cultural characteristics because of their usefulness, may operate on each of these strata while leading to a ‘non-utilitarian’ sorting on others. It is easy to accept that what is useful, for example, for a social group is not necessarily so for the individual and vice versa. As an exercise in imagination, for example, one could suggest the fol- lowing explanation of the origin of the sexual division of labour among our ancestors (we shall borrow a few explanatory principles from the hypothesis already alluded to by Alain Testart). Take groups of humans livingbyhuntingandgathering,inwhich,onthesociallevel,apurelycul- tural selection of ideas prevails, fostering the propagation of folk theories that comply with certain cultural principles and put at a disadvantage those that do not. Discrimination between the ‘good’ and ‘bad’ ideas operates according to social rules that have no direct connection with economic praxis; in other words, selection favours ideas that are accept- able from the point of view of symbolic constraints that do not match economic requirements. Let us assume that among the ideas ‘good to think’lurksaprincipleadvocatingtheseparationofwomenfromhunting tools. Let us also assume that our ancestors have worked out symbolic representations of femininity and of hunting that are in perfect accord with this separation. Under those circumstances, social selection would be bound to favour the emergence of a rigid prohibition that would keep women away not only from hunting tools but also from the actual ac- tivity of hunting which is possible only when using those tools. So the prohibition selected on the social level leads to a sorting of economic behaviour on the level of the individual, and hunting becomes a mas- culine activity while gathering is left to women. The selection of ideas will thus have effects not just of an individual order but on the social plane as well, where it will find its secondary expression in the form of an economic phenomenon, the sexual division of labour. Depending on the type of hunter-gathering economy, the consequences in practice will be different: in groups where the roles of hunting and gathering were for- merly in equilibrium, the division of labour may increase the efficiency of obtaining food and so acquire a secondary usefulness (exaptation) that is purely economic. In groups where basic food can be obtained through one activity only, either hunting or gathering, the sexual divi- sion of labour will prevent the best use being made of the productive potential of one or other of the sexes and so it will become inefficient from an economic point of view (such consequences are known among modern hunter-gatherers, the Chipewyans, for example, where hunting"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Evolutionary mechanisms  predominates,  and the !Kung where gathering is dominant and the men are often idle  ).

The stochastic processes that act on the genetic information in these small groups ( genetic drift ), accompanied by a greater facility for propagating mutants in a small population, can bring about real genetic revolutions. The hypothesis of a cladogenesis by geographic isolation is proposed, among others, by Yves Coppens who claims that ancestors common to both hominids and pongids, living in peri-equatorial Africa, found themselves cut into two populations some  million years ago, following renewed activity on the fault system of the Rift Valley. This cut-off, tectonic in nature, would soon have become an ecological bar- rier isolating ancestors of humans from their parent population. The hypothesis finds some support in the absence of pongid fossil remains observed on hominid sites of East or South Africa, as well as by the fact that the East African fauna become endemic from the end of the middle Miocene.  So there are a certain number of explanations that envisage alterna- tive mechanisms, or ones that are complementary to those traditionally favoured by hominisation scenarios.

Plato, The Republic ,  d I have repeatedly noted that the causal explanations offered by our sce- narios usually took the form of huge generalisations, to which a uni- versal validity was ascribed. ‘Tool-making necessitates language’, ‘life in the savannah implies hunting’, ‘hunting involves great risks’. Does hunting involve great risks? Where? Everywhere. When? Always. Un- der what circumstances? Under all circumstances. What hunting? All hunting. The left-hand side of the relations (‘if x ’) is thus reduced to the most simple and general formula possible. The right-hand side (‘then y ’) appears equally rudimentary and its content can move across in the fol- lowing ‘causal sequence’ to the left-hand side, to become the cause of a subsequent element in the causal chain. The paucity of the content decontextualises these statements and in the end they express nothing but relations that are valid apriori everywhere and at all times, applied to notions that are virtually abstract because they are too general (society in general, tools in general, hunting in general, etc.). David Hume advocated explaining all effects by principles that are as general as possible, and always looking for the simplest causes.  This precept matches up well with the common-sense view of causality, that displays a constant tendency to select, from a multitude of the necessary antecedents to any effect, one and one only, which is thought to be its cause.  Added to this reducing impulse comes the taste for vast gen- eralisations, broadening to infinity the validity of the supposedly causal  Hume  /  : xxi.  See for example Hilton  . "},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"A double game  relations (‘Nordic people are more reserved than southerners’, ‘brunettes are more hot-blooded than blondes’). References to universal laws, or to principles that claim to reduce the diversity of the world to simple equations, are notorious in everyday thinking. It is hardly surprising that the quest for universal laws of history and culture has never lacked its knights errant. The Enlightenment knew these enthusiasms very well. It was one of the dreams of the period to dis- cover rules governing human history, knowledge which would be helpful not only to reconstruct the past, but also to understand the present and to master the future as well. Physics offered then a model of scientific knowledge that had reached a state of definitive achievement, and por- traits of Newton decorated the studies of the scholars who all wanted to imitate the great physicist.  Reflection on society was not exempt from this aspiration. Of course, in human matters, everything appears to be the subject of chance, fantasy and the free will of individuals. But had not research into ‘physical nature’ also been formerly faced with a compa- rable chaos of incomprehensible phenomena? And yet, Immanuel Kant could write with confidence that in the end ‘there appeared on the scene a Kepler who, in a quite unforeseen manner, subjected the excentric orbits of the planets to determined laws, and a Newton who explained those laws in accordance with a universal natural cause’.  Just as numerous in the eighteenth century were those who shared the hope of similarly discovering the simple principles of ‘moral nature’, which must surely also be governed by laws ‘as fix’d as Fate’.  There were many who cherished the conviction that they had found such laws. Once these laws are set down where formerly everything seemed to be governed by fantasy, individual cases reveal an invisible order they are actually obedient to (so Montesquieu tells us in L’esprit des lois ).  Illusion was equal to the hopes, and the attempts to build a Newtonian anthropology inevitably fell into the traps of na ̈ ıve anthropology. In- evitably, since positive knowledge on culture, or ‘moral sciences’ as it was then called, was exceedingly limited: scholars found themselves con- strained, as any good bricoleur would be, to make use of such knowledge as was available. So they resorted to the works of ancient authors, to folklore, to common-sense judgements, to introspection, to travel nar- ratives, in short to every kind of source in which imaginary themes  Gusdorf  :  .  Kant  /  :  .  Pope  /  –  :  .

Consequently, instead of advancing, knowledge stagnated, bogged down in the ruts of traditional imagery: factual data, which could have corrected these conjectures, were cruelly lacking. Georges Gusdorf makes a very apposite comment on this point: In the understanding of the material world, Newton’s synthesis is the outcome of prolonged analytical work that had been going on for a good century since Galileo. By contrast, in the human sciences, where research had hardly started, everything happened as if the Newtonian model was proposing a synthesis even before any analysis had been seriously undertaken ... The fascination with Newton acted as a mirage, leading scholars astray by offering them convictions and conclusions before they had mastered the facts.  Indeed, the ambitious attempt at anthropological synthesis, undertaken without waiting for a sufficient empirical basis, ended by reproducing na ̈ ıve anthropology in a pseudo-scholarly form. In their approach, the authors of our palaeoanthropological scenarios all display more or less strong affinities with this tradition of the Enlight- enment. They accept in good faith a whole treasurehouse of ‘universal laws’, from which they draw the conclusions they want regarding the exis- tence of our ancestors. So, for example, being certain that hunting always exposes the hunter to great risks, they deduce that the hunting practised by hominids in the Plio-Pleistocene African environment inexorably im- plied dangers. Is this particular statement subject to empirical assessment when applied to a prehistoric context? Nothing entitles us to assert that it is: the theory is plausible but it is difficult to see what data might disprove it today. Moreover, some of our authors are aware of this problem, be- cause they emphasise more than once the absence of prehistoric vestiges that would allow their conjectures to be tested.  But this awareness still does not appear to shake their certainty that the explanations they offer succeed nevertheless in reflecting the reality of prehistoric life. Indeed, the anthropogenesis scenarios seek confirmation of their va- lidity not in a confrontation with the material vestiges of the past, but principally in the evocation of ‘universal laws’. Acquaintance with gen- eral principles that would have governed the world ‘from eternity’ is deemed to provide an adequate basis for the boldest prehistoric recon- structions.

We know that animals don’t think, that women are weak, men enterprising, hunting dangerous and that it is rash to venture out into the wild savannah alone and unarmed. We know that necessity is the mother of invention and that the funda- mental reason for things to exist is their usefulness. It is on certainties like these that a good many palaeoanthropological generalisations are built. They seem obvious, indisputable, self-evident, so much so that it occurs to nobody to subject them to empirical examination. This would be nonsensical, one of our authors declares, as absurd as ‘looking for archaeological evidence that apples fell to earth  .  million years ago’.  The ‘laws’ of biology and of culture would thus be as general as the law of gravity, and, thanks to them, the scientist would be able correctly to reconstruct anthropogenesis simply by means of deduction, even in the absence of prehistoric vestiges. More than a century ago, Cl ́ emence Royer was already invoking this argument to justify her theory of hu- man origins: ‘Let no one accuse us of gratuitous hypotheses. If these are hypotheses, conjectures, and that is all we can do here, at least they are all resting on ... necessary laws.’  There is no shortage of scholars who share that opinion even today:  a spontaneous view of the evolutionary mechanisms continues to strengthen them in their conviction that these laws can exist; na ̈ ıve anthropology offers a whole range of them. In reality, as we have seen, the useless may also exist, life in the savan- nah does not necessarily go hand in hand with hunting, women are not always relegated to gathering, certain complex cognitive processes can be realised without articulate language, large canine teeth are not used only for hunting and in defence against predators, bipedalism is not more efficient than quadrupedalism in every situation, etc. The wide range of validity these assertions aspire to is no more than a mirage. It is possi- ble, of course, that at the beginning of human history, life in an open milieu contributed to the development of hunting, that women saw their occupations restricted to gathering because of practical constraints, that articulate language brought with it a growth in our ancestors’ mental faculties.

This reminder will doubtless seem trite, even useless, but it must not be forgotten that there are still many anthropologists, as our scenarios bear witness, who proceed as if they were ignorant of the consequences of this conclusion. If they really understood it, they would be less willing to accept the intellectual game in which the palaeoan- thropological scenarios indulge with such happy abandon. Our authors carry on as if their conjectures became credible from the mere fact that they are plausible. Yet one more reason for me to repeat un flaggingly that only in the universe of na ̈ ıve conceptions, which have no alternatives, can the plausible be identified with the actual. It is only in that trompe-l’œil universe that plausibility becomes – as one author affirms – sufficient to accept a hypothesis.  In reality, validation based on plausibility can only separate those ideas that fit in with popular common-sense anthropology from those that go beyond it. Thus, the ‘plausibility’ of a hominisation scenario may guarantee its social success, but it tells us nothing about its value as a representation of historical reality. BACK TO THE FACTS That being so, the problem is simple: how do we distinguish, among the hypotheses commonly held to be true, between those that maintain a real link with their referential reality and those that belong entirely to the realm of ideas? The answer, as everyone will have guessed, is as simple as the question: the only way to establish that distinction is by confronting conjectures with empirical reality. If the precept seems simple, its application is much less so. Statements about our ancestors cannot be directly compared with prehistoric data. The connection can only be made by comparing hypotheses, the fruits of reasoning, with propositions that are themselves the outcome of other reasonings, which this time lead ultimately to the interpretation of fossils and archaeological vestiges. The assertion that hominids hunted is not based on the mere fact that archaeologists have discovered hominids’ artefacts mixed up with animal bones; it is put in parallel with an infer- ence that starts from these vestiges and interprets them, relying on the notion that fossil bones accompanied by tools represent the carcasses of animals killed by the makers of the tools.

Did we not read, a few years ago, that for archaeological interpretation ‘simple common sense is sufficient’?  It is significant that the first to cast doubts on this ‘common sense’ were specialists in Palaeolithic archaeology. The primitive hunters’ way of life, their material culture and its modest traces, still desperately fragmentary, seemed so strange, so far removed from the frame of experience familiar to most people today, that common sense can find few secure landmarks in it and is the more ready to capitulate. Each in his own way, Palaeolithic archaeologists  were also among the first to work out a ‘dictionary’ to translate the enigmatic code of material remains into the language of human behaviour.  The only way to construct such a ‘dictionary’ is through ‘actualist’ studies – experimental, ethnographic or other – which make it possible to observe cause and effect at the same time, that is both the material trace left by human behaviour and the gesture that produces it. The archaeologist is often compared to the detective; indeed, he has to proceed like Sherlock Holmes, who was not satisfied with examining corpses at the scene of the crime, and so tapped corpses in mortuaries with his cane to improve his ability to interpret bruises.  The development of actualist research, from which we have many results today, provides a good illustration of the difficulties of empirical validation and of the limits it imposes on the production of palaeoan- thropological conjectures. I shall give just one example here, found in Glynn Isaac’s scenario, where the key role in hominisation is attributed to the emergence of the sexual division of labour and to food-sharing.  Although this conception is based on a fairly classic scheme, Isaac was one of the few authors who attempted to predict how the hypotheses put forward, or at least some of them, might find expression in patterns of archaeological remains. For Isaac, the consumption of both meat and vegetable foods by hominids, inferred from archaeological data, must have implied a sexual division of labour into hunting for men and gathering for women, and this division would lead in turn to food-sharing. The argument goes as follows: the males, Isaac says, had to ven- ture far afield to hunt, while the women gathered plants near the base sites; consequently, sharing could only take place at these gathering  Courbin  :  .  Binford and Binford  ; Binford  .  For example ‘archaeological theory’ (Bayard  ), ‘middle range theory’ (Binford  ), ‘science of artefacts’ (Dunnell  ), etc.  Conan Doyle  /  :  –  , chapter I .  Isaac  ,  a,  b."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":" Explaining human origins places. The concentrations of animal bones accompanied by stone arte- facts should constitute indelible archaeological evidence of these camps and the sharing that went on there. Glynn Isaac thought that certain sites at Olduvai  fitted this pattern well, and he saw in these confirmation of his hypothesis of the division of labour, of the transport of food, and of sharing at the base sites. The essential point of this reasoning, passed over in silence in Isaac’s early texts, is the assumption that any concentration of bones and stone artefacts is evidence of hunting and of the transport of animal carcasses by hominids. Since the first publication of this hypothesis, further research has aimed at establishing an actualist data base necessary for the reliable reading of information provided by bone concentrations – research conducted by Isaac’s students, among others, and inspired by him. The results have already provided a wealth of clues. It was found that accumulations of animal remains may be formed also by the mere action of various natural forces, such as water transport,  or by epidemics and droughts that cause the death of many individuals gathered around a waterhole.  On the other hand, while it is true that hunting activities contributed in large measure to creating similar concentrations, we cannot forget that hominids were not the only hunters in the savannah, and that scavenging animals, too, transport and accumulate their prey.  Hyenas bring whole carcasses, or parts of them, to their dens; lions have a habit of dragging their prey to the shade of a tree.  It has been noted as well that carrying meat to a base site does not necessarily go with food-sharing.  As for stone tools mixed up with animal remains, their presence can just as easily be interpreted as traces of a group of hominids who stopped for a while in a place where predators had feasted hundreds of years later or earlier. This plethora of interpretations disturbs the ‘natural’ logic of the initial argument that identified any concentration of bones and artefacts as a base camp of humans. With time, Isaac himself accepted these alternatives, clearly mention- ing a list of possible readings of this type of vestiges. Here, for the record, is the list:   .

This example shows clearly that even the interpretation of a relatively simple archaeological fact is far from easy, and that common sense is not of much help. The spontaneous reading is inclined to attribute just one meaning, biased in favour of the hypothesis put to the test; in this way it is almost inevitable to produce, no doubt involuntarily, a ‘confirmation’. In order to undertake a genuine validation, it is necessary to estab- lish a system of interpretations founded on the keenest observation of archaeological remains; for a start there must be no more talk of ac- cumulations of bones in general, and we must learn to discriminate between different types, each one recognisable by particular clues, on which the deciphering of the material remains could rest.

His interpretation of accumulations of fossil bones and stone products was originally part of the following chain of inferences: I If a combined meat–vegetable diet, Then sexual division of labour; II If sexual division of labour, Then food-sharing; III If sexual division of labour, Then base camps; IV If food-sharing and if base camps, Then transport of food to the base camps; V If transport of food to the base camps, and if a meat diet, Then concentrations of animal bones as vestiges of the base camps.  Shipman  a,  b.  E.g.

Only sequence V establishes a link between the phenomena that can be inferred from archaeological or palaeonto- logical remains. The other inferences bring into play either an ‘observ- able’ element (traces of which may be preserved among the archaeo- logical remains) with a ‘non-observable’ element (for want of fossil data) ( I , III , IV ), or else they speak only of ‘non-observable’ phenomena ( II ). Now, even if archaeological vestiges become much more abundant than they are today, and even if their interpretation improves still further, it will be possible to validate only one assertion from such a scenario. In this case, we have the means to determine only what our ancestors ate and, occasionally, how they obtained their food and whether they trans- ported it to base camps. We cannot know whether they transported that food in order to share it, nor whether they practised sexual division of labour, and what the consequences were for social life and for the use of speech. The empirical data allow us to test only the lowest stage of the hypotheses; the rest, still based on the mirage of ‘general laws’, remains unverifiable. Although new discoveries await us and the methods of analysing them are constantly improving, it is no use hoping that every question will be answered. Our knowledge about anthropogenesis rests on the meagre traces that time has spared, the only clues enabling us to distinguish – to use the good old formula of Buffon – ‘between what is real in a subject and what arbitrary element we introduce by pondering on it’. As these traces are rare and fragmentary, only a small part of our conjectures can be submitted to empirical test. Better knowledge of anthropogenesis seems possible, then, if by that we mean better established, but not necessarily much broader knowledge. We can hardly hope that the majority of the conjectures judged to be reasonable and plausible will eventually be tested, and that we will be one day able to determine the ‘causes’ of anthropogenesis. One is struck, in this regard, by the constant efforts made by anthropology, which has long been trying to answer questions formerly posed by philosophical, even mythical thought – questions so ill-adapted to the constraints of verification that it is hard to imagine them being treated according to the rules of the scientific game.

The scientific game has its principles, and we must resign our- selves to the idea that, in bowing to them, we lose the comforting illusion that makes us believe that every past event can be known and explained. Unlike myths, science does not aim at explanation at any price. Its main ambition is to establish an empirically testable correspondence between the world and the hypothesis we form of it; so this particular game must be limited to enterprises in which this objective can be attained.

But if he refuses to play that way, then he isn’t exactly playing chess. D. H. Fisc her, Historians’ fallacies  If we define the game of science as attempts to construct representations of reality, aiming at a constant improvement of the correspondence be- tween the representations and the phenomena represented, we have to admit that the authors of our scenarios have little hesitation in contra- vening the rules of the game: correspondence to empirical data does not seem to be their main concern, and archaeological or palaeontological vestiges are often used solely in so far as they can furnish useful accessories to illustrate preconceived ideas, and so help to realise the major ambi- tion, which is to ‘explain the causes’ of the origin of humankind. (‘How did it come into existence? Why did it come into existence?’  ) Finding the answers to these questions, a task formerly assigned to philosophical speculation, which itself had inherited it from mythology, is taken over by the anthropologists, who, without perhaps always measuring the con- sequences, cheerfully take on a task that used to be performed under other rules and to other ends than those of scientific inquiry. The problem of origins has long exercised a surprising fascination on western thought: the hominisation scenarios are, without any doubt, one of its fruits, alongside an abundance of others, as much in the sciences as in philosophy and theology. In all these domains, knowledge of origins was very often identified with knowledge of the causes, and common sense seems to be in perfect agreement with the opinion of the scho- lars who, like Bacon, proclaimed that true knowledge is knowledge by causes.   Fischer  : xix.  Lumsden and Wilson  :  .  Bacon Novum Organum , II .  ."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":" Explaining human origins The human sciences very soon became one of the arenas of a frantic search for ‘causes’. Right until today, the ‘why’ remains more important for them than the ‘how’, which is only deemed interesting if it gives hope of finding the way to the former (‘the most useful part of history is not the dry knowledge of customs and facts; it is the knowledge that shows us the spirit that established those customs and the causes that led to the events’, wrote A.-N. Boulanger in the eighteenth century  ). In the historical sciences, of which prehistory and palaeontology are part, questions concerning causes are sometimes far from innocent. When philosophical theories referred at the same time to causes and origins, the intention was often to lay down an order for the present. En- lightenment philosophy provides emblematic examples of conjectures on origins, whose prime ambition was to find arguments in support of theories relating to the desirable organisation of society in the present. The conviction that the origin of things determines their nature has very ancient roots, and so has the idea that the essence of things appears in its pure form only in the original state, as yet unadulterated by the vicissitudes of history, the broad outlines of which would already be in- scribed in the primordial properties of things (‘the essential properties of things’, says Vico, ‘are the result of the circumstances in which they are born’  ). Two of our scenarios still assert that the study of the origin of man can teach us about the ‘nature of man’.  This ‘human nature’, supposedly formed at the time of anthropogenesis, is thought to deter- mine the whole subsequent course of history, and certain scenarios go so far as to pronounce on the future of civilisation, as if its origin con- tained an archetype, whose power would control all the vicissitudes of subsequent reality, and as if the knowledge about origin led to knowledge about destiny and the future. So theories of anthropogenesis readily set themselves up as moral tales, wishing not only to describe the ‘how’ and explain the ‘why’, but also to reveal the ‘direction’ of human history, its message, which would be delivered to us as a lesson or a warning. The most ancient texts in our sample, like that of Cl ́ emence Royer, convey an optimistic message about the progress of humanity, generating a state of bliss and dominion over the Earth in a relentless struggle against  Boulanger  , I :  .  Vico  /  :  .  ‘In it [the first phase of history] human beings acquired the basic habits of dealing with one another which still guide the behaviour of individuals, communities and nations. These habits are human nature, which can best be understood by learning how it came into being’ (Coon  /  :  ). ‘The search for understanding of “human nature” leads back in time to a consideration of the process which shaped our physical, social, emotional and cognitive characteristics’ (Tanner and Zihlman  :  )."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"A double game  a hostile nature. We recognise here the classic version of the narrative of miserable origins, which, invariably for centuries, has been heaping praise on ‘humanity ascending’, a panegyric following the formula la- conically summed up by Bergson, when he said: ‘the humbler our origin, the greater will be our merit in becoming what we are’. In the eighteenth century, the famous Second discourse drew a differ- ent morality from its view of origins. Rousseau’s primeval men, without being cruel or genuinely bestial, were nevertheless incomplete creatures, lacking many human characteristics. Their nature was not fully realised until the moment when the original mildness found its complement in the benefits of simple culture and in the abundance – quite Spartan, by the way – provided by the hunting and gathering economy. Rousseau’s ‘noble savage’, contrary to what is often believed, is not a purely nat- ural man; he is already a skilled hunter, who has had time to discover the advantages of culture, but he has not yet roused his negative po- tential, which will mark future civilisation with its unhappy effects. We find the same idea in the conception of the American anthropologist E. E. Ruyle,  where our first ancestors’ existence provides the image of animal imperfection, from which, in the course of anthropogenesis, human characteristics slowly emerge. The stage of developed hunter- gatherer society represents the climax of that progress; it offers the picture of an organisation based on the communist principles of equality, the just sharing out of property, and reciprocity. Hierarchy, exploitation and com- petition, all features – in the author’s view – of capitalist societies, are unknown. As in Rousseau, decadence creeps in with the transition to an agricultural economy. That is when humanity engaged on the slippery slope of an ‘ethical regression’,  which will lead people to indulge in odious and barbarous practices, like head hunting, scalping, cannibal- ism, human sacrifice, slavery, all accompanied by the supreme horror of social inequalities.  These ‘scourges’ would be unknown to prehistoric hunter-gatherers, whose way of life would be a direct result of the process of hominisation, guided by the simple rules of biological evolution that creates only what is useful, reasonable and just. Ruyle makes no secret of his Marxist inspirations, and the morality in his anthropogenesis sce- nario comes down to a trite view of decadent capitalist society, put in parallel with the bucolic picture of Palaeolithic primitive communism. Ruyle’s scenario is intended to be deliberately close, in part at least, to that of Engels, but its general conception of history is also influenced  Ruyle  .  Ibid. :  .  Ibid. ; the author refers to a work by Lenski (  :  –  )."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":" Explaining human origins by some ideas of the counter-culture of the sixties and the seventies, so quick to criticise contemporary society. The Marxist scenarios of Soviet authors, who also refer to Engels, never go as far as that. The axiom of evolutionary progress was one of the cornerstones of Soviet ideology and anthropologists would never have dared challenge it. The texts of M. F. Niestourkh and P. I. Boriskovski appeal to the classic view of the pitiful beginnings of history which in due course ends with the idyllic domination of humanity over nature. However, there is a new element to be added to the traditional explanatory scheme. Engels had written that ‘labour created man’;  Soviet authors returned to this notion and made labour not only the main characteristic of the primordial condition of humanity, but the driving force of progress as well. We should recall that the notion of labour, vague as it might be, occupied pride of place in Soviet propaganda. Here are some of its leitmotifs : the ‘bourgeoisie’, damned as parasitical from the mere fact that it was presented as exempt from labour, so justifying its persecution; the Leninist principle ‘if you don’t work, you don’t eat’; education by ‘labour’ in Soviet schools; the Stakhanovite cult of ‘heroes of labour’; ‘resocialisation’, as it was called hypocritically, in the ‘labour camps’ (the edifying designation given to the gulags), etc. The image is clear: labour represents the supreme value, the raison d’ˆ etre of humanity and the guarantee of its dignity. The palaeoan- thropologists and prehistorians hastened to add that labour also created man. But that is not all. Labour could not be individual, carried on in iso- lation, outside the community; the only labour that counted was within a group baptised by Soviet authors with the name of ‘collective’. It is precisely labour in ‘collectives’, they say, that transformed the ape into man.  It is difficult to put forward anything reasonable about the exis- tence of ‘collectives’ among the early hominids; little doubt remains as to the existence of ‘collectives’ in the Stalinist totalitarian system, where they were introduced so as to establish a fundamental structure of so- ciety, called on to fulfil the objectives of production, indoctrination and control by denunciation.  It is not surprising that the Soviet scenarios should have insisted so strongly on the importance of ‘labour’ and of the ‘collective’ in the process of hominisation; the projection of the principles of Soviet society into prehistoric times transforms the conception of origins into a justification of the established political order.  Engels  /  :  .  Niestourkh  :  –  .  E.g.

Robert Ardrey’s book African genesis is a typical example. Moreover, its moralising message is not dis- guised. If our ancestor survived the ecological cataclysms of prehistory, Ardrey asserts, it is because he was able to become ‘a predator whose natural instinct is to kill with a weapon’,  ready to assassinate not only animals but his fellow creatures as well. Humans still carry today the genetic legacy of the primordial killer; we are all the children of Cain. Ardrey wrote this book when the cold war was at its height, and the awareness of nuclear danger is clearly visible in it. The aim of the narrative, stated several times, is to convince readers that the Rousseauist view of the original goodness of human beings is nothing but a lie, that we are endowed with murderous instincts and that, for the first time, we are equipped with a totally effective weapon, which makes total murder possible. So the narrative of origins is intended as a warning: a mask must be removed, the true face of the human is to be unveiled and we have to understand what this bloodthirsty primate is capable of. An alarm call, certainly, but this message is intended to give hope too, by showing that evolution has also endowed us with, aside from a taste for blood, an efficient brain and free will, which allow the legacy of Cain to be overcome.  We do not know if our earliest ancestors fought each other bitterly, but it is certain that twentieth-century Europeans have done so, no holds barred. Ardrey’s scenario, written after two world wars and in dreaded anticipation of the third and definitive one, is a banal transposition of the present into the past. Under the pen of Ardrey – a former playwright – the universe of the early hominids becomes a na ̈ ıve travesty of modern political life, which seems curiously close to the theatrical reality of West Side Story , dominated by the brutal rivalry of enemy gangs. The notion of original rivalry has lost much of its attraction since the end of the  s. The counter-culture once more revived the figure of the noble savage, attributing aggression and war to the decadence of civilisation. In this new view, the earliest humans, quasi flower-children, are no longer fighting against nature, and nature has lost its frightening ‘stepmother’ characteristics to become a true mother.

Human beings are naturally good and distinguished from animals by their faculty of compassion, by altruism, by bursts of fellow- feeling and by their disposition to share everything with others. In the theory of Glynn Isaac, sharing takes the place of combat as the first cause of hominisation, becoming a premise that can explain the origin of every- thing: bipedalism, sexual division of labour, language, society, etc. This view, which archaeological data have not been able to corroborate de- spite Isaac’s sustained efforts, soon became very popular, matching, as it did, the intellectual climate of the seventies. Feminists in particular opposed the traditional vision of bloodthirsty combat, for a reason that is easy to guess. The classic theory, which claimed that we became human thanks to the great struggles of prehis- toric times, made of males the main heroes of traditional narratives: they alone were supposedly capable of hunting and waging war. What about the females in earliest times? We have seen that their role in the homi- nisation process was almost non-existent;  all they had to do was wait passively for inspiration from their more advanced male companions (‘in every shift of occupation of which we know throughout history, women have taken over the jobs formerly held by men, as the men have moved on to something new’  ). So woman would be a secondary product of hominisation; it was first man who descended from the ape, then woman ‘descended’ from man. The absurdity of this view passed oddly unnoticed until feminist an- thropology justifiably made it one of its preferred targets. But response to one excess soon became an opposite excess. The hominisation scenario proposed by primatologist Adrienne Zihlman and anthropologist Nancy P. Tanner  constructs a kind of inverted misogynist view, being content to reverse the distribution of roles: woman is now the leading actor in hominisation, and it is no longer masculine hunting but rather feminine gathering that is the main source of early subsistence. It was women, too, who were the first to adopt bipedal locomotion, invent tools, share food, practise cooperation and establish durable social bonds. The naturally ‘disruptive’ males are kept at a distance. If, with time, they hominise, it is again thanks to women, who establish a kind of breeding system: ‘Females preferred to associate and have sex with males exhibiting friendly behaviour, rather than those who were comparatively disruptive, a danger to themselves or offspring ... Mothers chose to copulate most frequently with these comparatively sociable, less disruptive, sharing  E.g.

The moral of this narrative is not excessively com- plicated: it amounts to showing the superiority of the female over the male and the dominant role of the fair sex in the emergence of human- ity. The whole is served up coated with a very scientific sauce, a skilful blend of sociobiology, primatology and palaeoanthropology. Another mission adopted by certain hominisation scenarios  is to prove the ‘unnatural’ and ‘secondary’ character of religious beliefs. The Soviet prehistorian P. I. Boriskovski has devoted special effort to this task.  His conception is intended to demonstrate that culture came into being without religion, hence it follows – in the author’s logic – that culture can manage without it today. In line with the traditional scheme of conjectural anthropology accepted by Boriskovski, religion appeared at a certain stage in history as a response to the fear felt by the savage when faced with the incomprehensible phenomena of a powerful and hostile nature. The strength of religious beliefs would thus be a function of the weakness of human beings, so that religion would be bound to disappear when civilisation, and in particular science, would give them a reassuring power that could set them free once and for all from fears inherent in the primitive state. This idea, dear to the Enlightenment philosophers, was amalgamated a century and a half later with the Soviet regime doctrine, which declared a veritable war on religion. Boriskovski’s scenario is in perfect harmony on this point with the axioms of Soviet propaganda and with the letter of the USSR Communist Party programme, in which the following statement can be found: ‘It is necessary to conduct a vast and systematic scientifico-atheist propaganda, to explain patiently the erroneous nature of religious beliefs, born in the past from the oppression felt by man faced with the incomprehensible forces of nature.’  Following these instructions, Soviet anthropologists were obliged to engage in ‘the struggle against hostile religious ideology’.  This struggle continues in the hominisation scenarios. It is fascinating to observe the multitude of edifying conclusions that the palaeoanthropological conceptions hasten to offer.

My purpose here is not to gloss on this elementary truth that sci- entific theories may be conditioned by ideology. I simply aim to illus- trate some of the ideological constructions possible with the very simple generative pattern that governs our scenarios. Indeed, all these narra- tives and their different morals have been made possible by permuta- tions carried out on just one matrix, composed of a list of stereotyped human characteristics that are arranged into reputedly causal chains, in accordance with a catalogue of relations that are themselves held to be plausible and obvious. This conceptual matrix is very efficient and the combinatory game of which it is the instrument, while inadequate for establishing an empirically tested view of anthropogenesis, nevertheless allows many narratives with varying meanings to be constructed. The elements thus made available to anthropologists, accompanied by a few ‘universal laws’, lend themselves to rearrangements free from any em- pirical constraint and built under the influence of an intellectual fashion, propaganda principles, an ideological engagement or a particular world- view. Do we play down the role of women? Then our ancestors lived by hunting, and hunting, the driving force of hominisation, was a masculine occupation. Do we rebel against male domination? Then our ancestors lived by gathering, gathering was a feminine occupation and it must be granted prime importance in the causal chain of the hominisation pro- cess. Do we admire the progress of civilisation? Then we shall adopt a view of feeble humans with no technical skill; we shall place them in a hostile nature and explain anthropogenesis by the primitive struggle that culminates in access to ever more flourishing culture. Do we doubt the benefits of progress? Then we make primitive nature bountiful, our an- cestors altruist, and brotherly sharing becomes the principal antecedent of explanatory sequences. This game can be played indefinitely, for the generative matrix that makes it possible is as simple as it is accommodating. All that is required in order to proclaim the invention of a new theory of anthropogenesis, or, through it, the advent of ‘a New Human Science’,  is a few rearrange- ments of old elements found in the treasure house of ideas ‘good to think  Lumsden and Wilson  :  ."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"A double game  with’, that have already stood the test of common sense.

The same metaphor could sum up the conclusions of our analysis of the hominisation scenarios. Their authors behave like Calvino’s Narrator or the Bricoleur of L ́ evi-Strauss; they make use of the elements of a pre-existing conceptual heritage and switch them round, modify and enrich them so as to construct narratives endowed with a ‘meaning’ or a message or a moral. In the event, the rules of the scienti fic game may be broken, but the narration triumphs. For some time now, the human sciences have begun to perceive more clearly the affinities between their writings and the classical narrative procedures. We have even been witnessing a real vogue for comparisons that assimilate scholarly works to literary or, indeed, mythical narra- tives, often with the explicit aim of proclaiming that the narrative is the only appropriate form of expression for speaking of things human. Palaeoanthropology has not been spared by this tendency: the work of Misia Landau  caused a stir by drawing parallels between the structure of six hominisation scenarios and that of the folk-tale, as described by Vladimir Propp.  Analogies do exist, of course. The scholarly scenar- ios of anthropogenesis are rather like folk-tales in that the plot in both begins in a state of equilibrium, which will be first disrupted and then restored by the efforts of a hero, for whom this adventure will become his initiation. It is true that the ‘feeble human’ of our scenarios calls to mind the character of the ‘stupid brother’ in fables, and that some of his characteristics would suit a character in a folk-tale. Yet the re- semblances remain superficial. We may compare Lucy with Cinderella, hominisation with an initiation rite, but the parallel is not very illumi- nating, for most of the processes that occur in the real world can be reduced to this mundane plan of an equilibrium disturbed and then restored, in which a Cinderella finds her lucky day. Misia Landau was right to point out that the hominisation scenarios are constructed from prefabricated elements, but these are not provided by folk-tales nor can those tales explain their nature.  The old tripartite model, that can be applied to the functioning of a bicycle pump or the flushing of a toilet just as well as to Aristotle’s definition of the narrative, is transformed into a hominisation scenario when it takes charge of remarkable con- ceptual matter, the true source of which – as we have seen – is very often common-sense anthropology, fed as much by philosophers as by ordinary thinking.  Landau  ,  .  Propp  /  .  Stoczkowski  c."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"A double game  Some scholars, while freely acknowledging the place of narrative de- vices in their texts, nevertheless hope that a difference does exist between the writings of the human sciences and novel writing, as if the narrative had the right to lay claim to truthfulness from the fact of being told by a scholar (‘history is a truthful novel’, says Paul Veyne  ). Analysis of the ‘narrative’ conjectures lavishly handed out by the hominisation sce- narios leaves no illusion as to the fanciful nature of the ‘truthful novel’, for it shows the extent to which the narrative constraints are at logger- heads with the ambition to give a ‘truthful’ account. Let us forget how unsatisfactory this last, epistemologically rustic adjective is, and note that the ‘veracity’ of a good many of the hominisation scenarios is – and will probably always remain – uncertain, for want of prehistoric ves- tiges with which to test their hypotheses. Palaeoathropologists are often content to propose narratives that evolve in a universe of plausibility, in which ‘universal laws’ evoked by way of justification bear much too close a resemblance to those samples of popular wisdoms assembled so scrupulously by Flaubert in his unrivalled dictionary of received ideas. A dictionary of anthropological ideas ‘good to think with’, an anthology of the simplistic but dauntingly ‘credible’ concepts, still awaits its author. I prefer to emphasise the dangers to which a ‘narrative’ anthropology is exposed. By avoiding the obligations of empirical vali- dation and preferring instead to unfold in the realm of the plausible, the narrative approach is easily tempted to seek its credibility in the seductive world of na ̈ ıve imaginary, whose imprimatur bears the stamp of common sense. If the hominisation scenarios seem convincing, this is because their credibility is based on the certitudes of conjectural anthropology, which continues to exercise a powerful influence on western thought. These fa- miliar commonplaces allow a decor to be created that confers an appear- ance of authenticity on the narrative. As in a movie – to situate the action in the past, for example in the Greco-Roman world, all that is required is a conventional set, which would be credible both for its exoticism and for the familiarity of a vanished civilisation, still present in our imaginary: the obligatory accessories are ‘colonnades, peristyles, temples with pedi- ments, monumental stairways, marble statues, triumphal arches, bronze tripods where the fire of the ancient gods burns eternally: an evocative atmosphere rather than an archaeologically accurate reality, always uncertain and inevitably awkward’.  Just as the earliest explorers of America presented the exoticism of the Antipodes by resorting to its  Veyne  :  .  Eloy  :  ."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":" Explaining human origins mythical attributes codified by Pliny, so the authors of our scenarios depict hominisation by recycling the usual ingredients of an imaginary prehistory, bequeathed to us by na ̈ ıve anthropology as our heritage; we then marvel at their plausibility, as do Flaubert’s Bouvard and P ́ ecuchet who, without knowing the models, found the portraits of ancient kings ‘true to life’. However, we must beware of concluding that archaeological reality is of as little interest to palaeoanthropologists as it was to Flaubert’s gullible characters or to the director of BenHur . Such an assertion would be both unjust and inaccurate. Our scenarios allot a certain amount of space to prehistoric data even if, alas, they do not bring them directly into play in their explanatory reasonings. The fundamental problem of the conjectural procedure on display in the hominisation scenarios is that empirical validation is too often neglected, so that it never carries equal weight with the constraints imposed by rules of the narrative that aims to extract a meaning from the events, or endow them with a moral. And those rules were actually conceived so as to be of use to fiction. Speaking about genesis amounts here to decreeing it, and the account does not inform us how things really happened; it tells how people need to imagine that things happened. The empirical data are appealed to only so long as they do not disturb; their usefulness is that of an illustration, for elements of reality are only evoked to favour the reader’s adherence to the unfolding of the fiction. The constraints of the narrative, like the ambition – inherited from philosophical tradition, which in turn owes it to theology – to know the ‘origins’ and the ‘nature’ of things, sit badly with the commitments of sci- ence, whose fundamental aspiration is to seek an empirically controlled correspondence between conceptual representations and the phenom- ena represented. The two genres remain barely compatible, for their principles are at variance: what appears to be a defect in science is often a virtue in narrative and vice versa. The palaeoanthropological narrative, as conceived by the tradition of western thought, is primarily interested in a total ‘explanation’ of anthro- pogenesis, which has to establish an exemplary state of human condition, or its counter-image. The scientific game, for its part, stops short at con- structing an image of the world capable of empirical verification. When the storyteller realises that the information at his disposal is fragmentary and inadequate to satisfy the desire for a complete and ab- solute understanding, he turns to the sensus communis which abounds in fine formulae favourable to moralising interpretations that cannot but"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"A double game  be complete and definitive. Scientific knowledge, on the other hand, as its short history shows, is characterised rather by the reverse tendency: it usually obliges us to put aside the familiar opinions, and it disappoints by its semiotic poverty, which precludes the facile grafting on of philo- sophical extensions loaded with ‘meaning’. So the narrative finds its legitimacy in adjusting to commonly held conceptions, whereas science insists on anchoring itself in empirical data. This last imperative imposes the working out of precise and unequiv- ocal systems for representing data, in which notions can be calculated, evaluated and measured. Equally clear and unequivocal must be the rules of the inference, freed from the limits of ‘natural logic’, a few elo- quent examples of which we have seen. The storyteller is exempted from these requirements. The labyrinth of natural language is his preferred domain, since precision is no use to him and can even be a drawback when it curbs the polysemy that must ‘give food for thought’; and if that polysemy at the same time produces logical incoherences owing to an excess of meanings, the ‘woolliness’ of language comes to the rescue and mercifully conceals them. Science builds up knowledge in order to challenge it, whereas the narrative is made to last; the fate of the former is to be demolished, whereas the latter courts admiration. Scientific knowledge contrives to be cumulative, thanks to incessant toings and froings between the general theories and the empirical data, which are being continually enriched. The narrative has a static character, based as it is on a combinatory game that unfolds within the limits of its own generative matrix. Although everything seems to separate the rules of storytelling from those of science, in the humanities the two genres still live in a very special symbiosis; we may wonder whether it really deserves that name, in that the consequences of the situation are not necessarily of the happiest, especially for knowledge that claims to be empirical: the narrative has its private preserves, where it develops exuberantly and untrammelled, while science suffers from that dual play, loses its identity and betrays its true vocation, its texts becoming yet another means of expression at the service of ordinary thinking. When the story takes a hand in the argument, the original hypotheses soon give way to clich ́ es, for the narrative is like social conversation, of which Andr ́ e Maurois said that it has its strict rules which demand sacrifice of ideas. ‘Guessing is always more fun than knowing’, W. H. Auden wrote ironically.

So scientists seem to be faced with an apparently simple choice: either they are content to explore the narrative possibilities offered by the conceptual raw material inherited from the past, or they resolve to explore the external world itself, by confronting hypotheses with empirical data. But this alternative is deceptive. It would be illusory to hope that scientists might be able to free themselves entirely from the weight of intellectual tradition and look at the world with new eyes, free from any conditioning that culture and their past cannot fail to exert on the thought of the individual. In fact, the real question is to know not whether or not one can be freed from the past, but rather to what extent one is capable of being so freed and in what way. If the question is rarely asked, it is because scientists think they know the right answer in advance; some believe they have shrugged off history completely, while others are sure they are irremediably its captives. These hasty certainties stem from epistemological ideologies in which too much faith is sometimes placed. It is indeed striking that the problem of the relationship to the past and to tradition lies just below the surface of all epistemological theories, without any of them giving it explicitly the importance it deserves. Yet scientists can never escape the necessity of defining their relationship to the past of their discipline or their culture, and the solutions we are led to adopt in this matter bring in their wake methodological consequences that are by no means negligible. In our own day, most scientists seem convinced that they are light years away from the attitude of ancient and medieval thinkers, for whom schol- arly enquiry was consubstantial with constant reference to their predeces- sors, whose chronological remoteness could only increase their author- ity; originality, novitas , was considered to be a fatal flaw, and conformity with the ancient auctoritates was held to be a legitimate form of episte- mological validation.  Nowadays we feel closer to the scholars of the eighteenth century, who witnessed the spread of an ideology favouring  Mortier  :  –  ."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"A double game  a break with the past and made a new rhetoric fashionable, one destined to glorify originality and present it as the fruit of rejecting tradition. Since then, any self-respecting intellectual activity, and science in par- ticular, has made a point of emphasising its ability to free itself from the past, making rebellion against the established authorities and opinions a clich ́ e, in statements that are the more widespread for being pure form and imposing no practical obligation on their authors. The conviction that one can break with tradition forms part of this new tradition. In the nineteenth century, Auguste Comte was voicing an opinion that was already largely accepted, when he proclaimed that positive knowl- edge takes shape not thanks to, but in spite of the past, and that science, the definitive regime of human reason, was built not from the debris but on the debris of ancient systems of thought.  Prehistory, a new science that appeared at the same period, immediately made itself the mouth- piece of a similar conviction, announcing that it would extricate itself without delay from the burdensome heritage of beliefs, in order to build a new and positive knowledge based on observation: ‘Modern science’, wrote Henri du Cleuziou in  , in a book devoted to prehistory, ‘leav- ing behind preconceived theories, accepted solutions, the marvellous and the supernatural, now demands facts from its followers, nothing but facts, formally established, strictly tested and utterly irrefutable.’  This ideology of rupture with the past has been joined, almost natu- rally, by the ideology of empiricism, which saw in factual data an ade- quate means of salvation, that would be bound to allow science to get away from the past and from its bundle of preconceived ideas: hence- forth, scientists wanted to owe everything to new data, nothing to old ideas. This hope is still alive among researchers who cling to modern forms of empiricism; they are by no means rare, despite the repeatedly proclaimed death of positivism. The perennity of these hopes explains, at least in part, the contempt in which the history of science is usu- ally held by practising scientists: so those who study the prehistoric past venerate paradoxically the future, expecting it to provide a rich harvest of data, and believe they can turn their backs for good on the past of their discipline, which promises them no new archaeological vestiges. But the gradual abandonment of empiricism and orthodox positivism, that we have been witnessing since the  s and that accompanies the emergence of epistemologies of a more sociological bent, has neverthe- less not challenged the ideology of rupture. The very popular concept  Comte  /  .  Du Cleuziou  :  ."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":" Explaining human origins of scientific revolutions has merely extended the notion of the rupture to science as a whole. According to this new epistemological vulgate, deep gulfs separate not only the different types of thought, as Comte would have it, but the different scientific theories as well. Kuhn summed up clearly its view of a history punctuated by catastrophes of change of paradigm, claiming that any scientific revolution empties specialist libraries of the old books and periodicals, now suddenly out-of-date.  Kuhn’s thesis, reproduced in countless variants by a wide range of au- thors, has found a logical extension in a fashionable trend of the history of science that openly proclaims its sociological inspiration and asserts that the scientific ideas of each period must be explained by their own ‘context’ (social, economic, political, intellectual, cultural, etc.). Thus, for example, the emergence of the evolutionist ethnology is supposed to be explained by saying that its creators, being middle-class Victorians, and living in the society in which they lived in their own times, could have only those ideas and no others; this is asserted solely because they did in fact have those ideas and no others; it is a certitude that ideas are a mere reflection of society; all that remains is to find out, whatever the cost, in what way they reflect it.  Even if this assumption may occasionally be heuristically useful, it none the less leads its supporters to think that the history of a science is of no use to the practitioners of that same science today. If, in order to have new ideas about the prehistoric past, for example, it were essential to have a new society in the present, then, instead of excavating or inventing interpretations, it would be better to work towards changing society, so that, by the mysterious laws of the alchemy of ‘context’, it would then produce a new view of prehistory. It may be no accident that a great many archaeologists who espouse such social determinism in epistemology seem to be strongly attracted by political militancy, often to the detriment of reflection and research, the virtues of which they manifestly do not believe in.  In this case, too, the view of history as punctuated by ruptures remains intact and the past of the sciences is carved up into a great many chronological slices, each of which remains separated from the others, being supposedly governed by the rules appropriate to its local ‘context’. The slices of the past are reserved for historians (provided, of course, that the nineteenth-century specialist does not encroach on the immeasurably different slice, so it is said, of the eighteenth-century specialist), while practising researchers can be content with the immediate present, dating  Kuhn  .  See, for example, Stocking  .  See Tilley  ."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"A double game  from after the latest revolution, which has kindly swept the libraries clean of ‘out-of-date works’. Orthodox positivism, still surfacing again today where it is least ex- pected, Thomas Kuhn’s still popular theory of scientific revolutions, and the sociological approach of today’s historians, all agree on at least one point: they all claim that it is the destiny of science to set itself completely free from its own past. Science will achieve this either by following an up- ward movement along a scale of evolutionary steps, each stage of which marks the transition to a new quality, or by cyclical purification through the regenerating cataclysms of the change of paradigms, or else by mov- ing from one ‘context’ to another, in so far as each generation would have ‘to rethink their view of the world’.  Opinions like this, long outworn, have accustomed us to imagining that the history of scientific thought is made up, in the long term, of profound ruptures which periodically free researchers from the pressur e that any tradition might exert. In our cul- ture, which idolises change, scholars share with laypeople the belief that the persistence over a long period of elements of the past is an anomaly, and that it is doubly so in the realm of science, conflicting here both with the normal course of history and with the fundamental mechanisms of the metamorphoses of scientific theories. So it is not surprising that all these epistemological ideologies show very little interest in the problems researchers must confront, faced with the conceptual patrimony bequeathed by the sometimes distant past of their own culture. The persistence in the present of ideas from the past, however little it may be recognised, arouses two types of stereotypical re- action, which, unfortunately, bypass the real question. The first reaction consists in denying the existence of the phenomenon and in insinuating that historical continuities are just an artefact produced by lack of preci- sion in historical research embedded in the study of themes that are too vast, like the chain of beings or primitivism which used to fascinate Arthur Owen Lovejoy; the perennity of such themes would be only apparent and proportional to their generality. Yet the works of historians of ideas, so discredited for the last thirty years, have been too numerous and too well documented to be refused all credence simply because some of the criticisms levelled at them were pertinent. The second reaction, while acknowledging the existence of persistent ideas, consists in assuming that conceptions that migrate from one historical ‘context’ to another nec- essarily belong to the category of the obvious and indisputable facts of  Peter J.

Accepting this naturalist view of common sense amounts to believing that only truisms, which reality itself obliges us to accept as evidence, could remain invariable in the long term, while all other ideas, being arbitrary conventions determined by culture, would inevitably evolve according to historical metamorphoses. Thus, the consensus of episte- mological ideologies (otherwise disparate) with regard to the existence of deep ruptures in the history of science leads many researchers to think that long-term conceptual continuities are either misleading artefacts produced by bad historians, or natural facts that escape the movement of history because of their absolute certainty. Having tried in this book to gather together proofs in support of an- other view, I can now sum up its arguments in several points. First, we have been able to see that ideas exist that are frankly impervious to histor- ical change and, without being invariable in the absolute sense, change so slowly that a number of epochs, sometimes very remote from each other, are marked by their presence. Second, I have tried to show that the transformation of these ideas follows rules which create the effect of structure: what is genuinely invariable in the long run is not the scenarios, nor the explanatory theories, nor yet the essential ideas in themselves, but the structure underlying all these conceptual constructs. Third, the com- ponents of these same conceptual constructs, and the structural rules by which they are organised, constitute an important part of our common- sense knowledge, but this common sense is not a catalogue of certainties stemming from the nature of things; on the contrary, it is a cultural con- struct, rich in arbitrary ideas that are anything but first truths bereft of prior principles. It must be emphasised, with Clifford Geertz, that this view of common sense as a cultural construct usually gets a hostile re- ception, because it is inherent in common sense to deny that common sense could be a hotchpotch of received wisdom, accepted by virtue of a social convention masquerading as a natural phenomenon (‘anybody in their right mind cannot but accept these natural facts’, states common sense as it judges the opinions ... of common sense  ). Fourth, I have  The Article ‘Common sense’ in the Encylop ́ edie ; Jaucourt  /  –  , XV :  –  .

This persistence, which creates links in time between different ‘social contexts’, is a fundamental fact of history just as change is, and it is this that creates the continuity of a civilisation. The theories of anthropogenesis, a sample of which I have analysed, betray, in fact, the influence of a dual determinism: they are tied in, on the one hand, to a succession of earlier conceptions which provide a structured raw material that nurtures innovations; on the other hand, they are subject to the influence of successive historical and cultural con- texts, which decide how the heritage of the past is used and amended.  Every new act is played here on a stage that is already constructed, pre- pared by the past. Continuity and discontinuity, innovation and tradition represent two sides of the same coin. Like any social fact, the homini- sation scenarios fit into their present without thereby cutting themselves off from the past, and they form the links in a series that crosses the ages. The historiographic mode of the moment urges us to believe that only the ‘present’, with its empirical data and its context, influences scientific thought, as if the impact of causal factors was measured by their chrono- logical proximity. However, we must not forget that the past, remote as it may be, acts on us with a force no less powerful than that of the present. What would we say, Marc Bloch wondered, about an astronomer who proclaims that the action of the moon on our globe is stronger than that of the sun, because the moon is nearer?  Acknowledging that historical processes can be slow and protracted, that timelags due to the force of inertia are omnipresent, that the ideas of yesterday and the day before weigh on those of the present, does in fact offer a few practical consequences, not only to the historian but also to any scientists who seek a better mastery of their conceptual tools. Fashionable epistemological ideologies insinuate that those tools depend only on the available empirical data and the immediate cultural ‘context’. The analysis to which we have subjected the hominisation scenarios suggests that in this particular case the conceptions that the specialists build up cannot be explained in their totality either by the constraints of the chronologically linked ‘context’, as the sociologising history of  Claude L ́ evi-Strauss, on the basis of his analysis of Amerindian myths, was the first to draw attention to this dual causality, at once structural and historical, which governs the conceptual constructions; L ́ evi-Strauss  :  .  Bloch  /  :  ."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":" Explaining human origins the sciences would have it, or by the factual data, as empiricism would like. Contrary to what is often thought, scientists do not draw their conclusions from empirical data, any more than they rewrite history in terms of prevailing ideology. In fact, they rather try to organise the heterogeneous conceptual materials that society places at their disposal, and these include new facts and recent ideologies just as much as ancient commonplaces. These various materials are the actual data on which the scientists work; the scientists infer nothing from them; they just put them in order. And there are two ways of putting them in order: first the one in which speculative ideas predominate and empirical data are subordinate to them, and second, the one where the opposite holds good. Researchers are accustomed to give this second procedure the term ‘scientific’, but frequently they are content to practise the first. The ignorance of the history of sciences in particular, and of the history of Western thought in general, entails the first procedure, because the lack of historical know- ledge favours the transformation of the arbitrary and epistemologically fragile conventions of common sense into ‘natural facts’, and this shelters them from any attempt at empirical evaluation, whereas the ideas slightly removed from the dogmas of common sense are put aside apriori , before their pertinence can be assessed. In fact, scientists do not have to choose between exploring the combi- natory possibilities offered by the conceptual material inherited from the past, and exploring empirical reality. They have to conduct the two op- erations simultaneously, well aware that the empirical data, interrogated in terms of the interpretative hypotheses, will provide them with answers of an interest proportional to that of the questions asked, and that the questions are not easy to formulate without mastering the conceptual matrices, of which history can reveal all the combinatory possibilities, way beyond those that conditioned imagination enables us to glimpse.
