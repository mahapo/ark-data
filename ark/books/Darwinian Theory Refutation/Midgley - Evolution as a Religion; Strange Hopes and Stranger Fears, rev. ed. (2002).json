In the early 1980s I was asked to speak at aconference on ‘Evolution and Religion’. This suddenly made me wonder whether thelink between these two things was perhaps closer than had been noticed. Was theidea of evolution somehow beginning to be used, not so much as an antidoteagainst religion but as a substitute for it – indeed, as a form of religionitself?I had been struck for some time by certain remarkable prophetic and metaphysicalpassages that appeared suddenly in scientific books about evolution, often intheir last chapters. Though these passages were detached from the officialreasoning of the books, they seemed still to be presented as science. But theymade startling suggestions about vast themes such as immortality, human destinyand the meaning of life. These are difficult topics with which philosophical andreligious thinkers have long wrestled. But the scientific writers did notusually refer to any earlier discussions. They simply and confidently laid downtheir own surprising views about them. Their pronouncements seemed to beseriously intended. But it was far from clear on what level they were meant tobe taken.All this seemed to me to raise most interesting questions about the kinds ofthought that can go on in the wide areas that lie outside both official scienceand official religion. Simply defining these two provinces does not help us muchwhen so many other ways of thinking are possible. In this book, then, I tried tosketch out a wider map on which these speculations might be placed so as to tellus something about the general shape of our thought. Some years later, Iextended this map further in a book called Science As Salvation,1 to deal withsimilar – and even more startling – pronouncements made by physicists –especially cosmologists – and promoters of artificial intelligence.Today, the approach to this phenomenon that I suggested in these two books stillstrikes me as reasonable. But has it got out of date? In sixteen years, the kindof quasi-scientific speculation that I wrote about might easily have been quitediscredited and abandoned. In that case my books would, of course, no longer beneeded.I wish that this had happened. Instead, quite to the contrary, quasi-scientificspeculation of the kind that I wrote about is, if anything, an even more rampantgrowth now than it was when I first drew attention to it. Moreover, it stillcomes in the same general forms.Certainly the balance of emphasis between those forms has shifted somewhat. ButI think it would not be sensible to rewrite the book now in order to track thatshift. Academic life moves very slowly and strong rhetoric, once launched, cankeep afloat for an amazingly long time. Several of the books that I have quotedhave had huge sales. They are still regularly used as textbooks on countlesscourses. Their influence, direct and indirect, is bound to persist for a longtime, even in those cases where, at a more refined level, they are supposed tohave been refuted.It will persist because the appeal of the myths that underlie them is strong –so strong that, even if particular forms of those myths do become obsolete, newones are always likely to replace them. And the point of my mapping project isnot just to object to the particular forms. It is to make us more aware of theunderlying myths themselves. That is the only way in which we can get somecontrol over their influence. We still very much need to do this, even where aparticular expression of them may be going out of fashion.Among these recent shifts of emphasis the most obvious one is due to the end ofthe Cold War. Marxism, which I repeatedly cited as an example of aquasi-scientific faith approximating to a religion, has ceased to play that rolein the West. It is, however, still vigorous as a faith in many parts of Africaand South America. And its effect on the history of Europe – and indeed of China– seems to me still persistent enough to make it important for us to understandit. So I do not think it would be sensible to remove it from my text. On theeconomic front, Marxist mythology has been succeeded by that of its nearneighbour the belief in Market Forces, which also sometimes uses religiousimagery, for instance in the notion of the Hidden Hand. That faith, however,does not usually appear in scientific books, so it is not relevant to my subjecthere.By contrast, prophecies of a dazzling future for humanity, attainable throughgenetic engineering or artificial intelligence or both, have, if anything, grownlouder and more frequent of late. So has the tendency to treat that project asif it were the inevitable next stage of evolution. But I do not think that theyhave become any more intellectually respectable, or produced any new argumentsthat I ought to answer.What I said against such ideas in these two books still seems to me to be valid.I still think, as I did sixteen years ago, that these projects have nothing todo with any reputable theory of evolution. And for our real problems in theworld, which are essentially social and moral, biochemical solutions (asproposed in genetic engineering) are usually irrelevant. Nor does it make senseto suggest that machines programmed by existing human beings will be able toreform our society for us when we cannot do it for ourselves. These schemesstill seem to me to be just displacement activities proposed in order to avoidfacing our real difficulties.About sociobiology the position is rather different. Here, at the academiclevel, things have certainly improved. At that level, the crude rhetoric ofselfishness has been toned down and solid scientific points about howpopulations develop have, to some extent, been separated from ideologicalexaggerations. To mark this greater sobriety, the very word sociobiology is nowlargely avoided in learned circles.Unluckily, however, as far as the wider public is concerned, the horse of mythhad bolted long before this stable door was locked. Selfish-genery now colourslarge areas of our intellectual landscape and it is likely to go on doing sountil some other invading myth displaces it. Anyone who wants to know what iswrong with the scientific aspects of it should read Evelyn Fox Keller’s splendidbook The Century of the Gene.2 But the imaginative aspect of it, which is what Italked about here, still remains, and as far as I can see my discussions of thatare still likely to be needed. So I have let them stand.1 London, Routledge, 1992.2 Harvard University Press, 2000."},{"pageContent":" 1 Evolutionary DramasThere is grandeur in this view of life.Charles DarwinScience and SymbolismThe theory of evolution is not just an inert piece of theoretical science. Itis, and cannot help being, also a powerful folk-tale about human origins. Anysuch narrative must have symbolic force. We are probably the first culture notto make that its main function. Most stories about human origins must have beendevised purely with a view to symbolic and poetic fittingness. Suggestions abouthow we were made and where we come from are bound to engage our imagination, toshape our views of what we now are, and so to affect our lives. Scientists, whenthey find themselves caught up in these webs of symbolism, sometimes complain,calling for a sanitary cordon to keep them away from science. But this seems tobe both psychologically and logically impossible.Our theoretical curiosity simply is not detached in this way from the rest ofour life. Nor do scientists themselves always want it to be so. Some of thesymbolic webs are ones which they approve of, and promote as part of the idealof science itself. For instance, Jacques Monod, as an atheistical biochemist,does not just rejoice at getting rid of the theistic drama. He at once replacesit by another drama, just as vivid, emotive and relevant to life, in whichSartrian man appears as the lonely hero challenging an alien and meaninglessuniverse:It is perfectly true that science attacks values. Not directly, since science isno judge of them and must ignore them; but it subverts every one of the mythicalor philosophical ontogenies upon which the animist tradition, from theAustralian aborigines to the dialectical materialists, has based morality,values, duties, rights, prohibitions.If he accepts this message in its full significance, man must at last wake outof his millenary dream and discover his total solitude, his fundamentalisolation. He must realize that, like a gypsy, he lives on the boundary of analien world; a world that is deaf to his music, and as indifferent to his hopesas it is to his sufferings or his crimes.1 [22_Notes.html#fn-c01_en1]But ‘discovering his total solitude’ is just adopting one imaginative stanceamong many possible ones. Other good scientists, very differently, have used thecontinuity of our species with the rest of the physical world to reprove humanarrogance and to call for practical recognition of kinship with other creatures.Many, like Darwin and the great geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky, have held thatan attitude of awe and veneration for the wonders of the physical world is anessential condition for studying them properly. Others have talked in a morepredatory way about the joys of the chase and the triumph of catching facts.Both motives, and many others, are evidently so habitual in science that theyare only not mentioned because they are taken for granted.It seems often to be assumed that they are therefore irrelevant, that Scienceitself is something so pure and impersonal that it ought to be thought of incomplete abstraction from all the motives that might lead people to practise it.This, unfortunately, cannot work because of the importance of world-pictures.Facts are not gathered in a vacuum, but to fill gaps in a world-picture whichalready exists. And the shape of this world-picture – determining the mattersallowed for it, the principles of selection, the possible range of emphases –depends deeply on the motives for forming it in the first place.Imagination, which guides thought, is directed by our attitudes. For instance,predatory and competitive motives tend to produce a picture dominated bycompetition and predation – one in which these elements do not only play theirpart, as they did for Darwin, but are arbitrarily and dogmatically isolated assole rulers. Thus, in a familiar distortion which will concern us repeatedly,the sociobiologist M. T. Ghiselin flatly declares:The evolution of society fits the Darwinian paradigm in its most individualisticform. The economy of nature is competitive from beginning to end. Understandthat economy, and how it works, and the underlying reasons for social phenomenaare manifest. They are the means by which one organism gains some advantage tothe detriment of another. No hint of genuine charity ameliorates our vision ofsociety, once sentimentalism has been laid aside. What passes for cooperationturns out to be a mixture of opportunism and exploitation. The impulses thatlead one animal to sacrifice himself for another turn out to have their ultimaterationale in gaining advantage over a third, and acts for the good of one‘society’ turn out to be performed for the detriment of the rest. Where it is inhis own interest, every organism may reasonably be expected to aid his fellows.Where he has no alternative, he submits to the yoke of servitude. Yet, given afull chance to act in his own interest, nothing but expediency will restrain himfrom brutalizing, from maiming, from murdering – his brother, his mate, hisparent, or his child. Scratch an ‘altruist’ and watch a ‘hypocrite’ bleed.2[22_Notes.html#fn-c01_en2]As we shall see, this claim is essentially pure fantasy, not only unsupported bythe empirical facts which are supposed to be its grounds, but actually contraryto them, such as they are. Is this a quite exceptional aberration? Some willsuspect that it must be, not only because the world-picture involved is a badone, but because scientists ought to be so impartial that they either do nothave anything so unprofessional as a world-picture at all, or, if they have one,do not let it affect their work.But this is a mistaken ideal. An enquirer with no such general map would only bean obsessive – someone who had a special motive for collecting factsindiscriminately. He would not be a person without an attitude, or withoutspecial motives, but one with motives so odd as to inhibit the kind oforganizing activity which normally shapes people’s ideas into some sort ofcoherent whole. Merely to pile up information indiscriminately is an idiot’stask.Good scientists do not approximate to that ideal at all. They tend to have avery strong guiding imaginative system. Their world-picture is usually apositive and distinctive one, with its own special drama. They do notscrupulously avoid conveying any sense of dark and light, of what matters andwhat does not, of what is to be aimed at and what avoided at all costs. They usethe lights and shadows to reveal the landscape. Like those who argue usefully onany other subject, they do their best work not by being neutral but by havingstrong preferences, being aware of them, criticizing them carefully, expressingthem plainly and then leaving their readers to decide how far to share them.Symbolism, then, is not just a nuisance to be got rid of. It is essential. Factswill never appear to us as brute and meaningless; they will always organizethemselves into some sort of story, some drama. These dramas can indeed bedangerous. They can distort our theories, and they have distorted the theory ofevolution perhaps more than any other. The only way in which we can control thiskind of distortion is, I believe, to bring the dramas themselves out into theopen, to give them our full attention, understand them better and see what part,if any, each of them ought to play both in theory and in life. It is no usemerely to swipe at them from time to time, like troublesome insects, whileofficially attending only to the theoretical questions. This will not make themgo away, because they are a serious feature of life.Darwin’s BalanceThe drama that attends a theory need not, then, be mere melodrama. Whensensationalism is present it is either irrelevant or – if it really belongs to atheory – shows that that theory is bad. The drama that goes with a good theoryis simply the expressive aspect of the theory itself. In order of time, it isoften conceived in advance of much of the supporting evidence. But when furtherfacts accumulate, it ought to respond to them by refining and subtilizing itscruder outlines.This process usually makes it less extreme and one-sided, and so moves it awayfrom the gratuitous sensationalism which marks melodrama. That does not make itless stirring or less important for life; it can make it more so. Thisimaginative and emotional deepening is part of the growth of a theory, not justa chance ornament. When the young Darwin immersed himself in the arguments aboutcosmic purpose in Paley’s theological textbook The Evidences of Christianity,and repeatedly read Paradise Lost on exploring trips from the Beagle,3[22_Notes.html#fn-c01_en3] he was neither wasting his time nor distorting hisscientific project. He was seriously working his way through a range oflife-positions which lay on the route to the one he could finally use.The result of this long preliminary pilgrimage was to make his own pictureunusually balanced and inclusive. To keep it so is, however, terribly hard. Hehimself made clear that he felt this difficulty deeply, and was constantlydissatisfied with his efforts, constantly changing his books to do justice tosome neglected angle. The vastness of the truth and the one-sidedness offormulae always haunted him.This haunting by no means reduced his work to an undramatic neutrality. Instead,the tension of opposites makes the drama which he shows us comprehensive andShakespearian, so that it includes every mood. Gillian Beer has lately pointedout how rich his style is in fertile metaphors and models, which he continuallyuses to supplement and correct each other.4 [22_Notes.html#fn-c01_en4]Centrally, he will not lose hold of either of the two emotional responses whichbelong most naturally to evolutionary speculation – on the one hand, optimistic,joyful wonder at the profusion of nature, and on the other, pessimistic, sombrealarm at its wasteful cruelty. Since he cannot qualify every sentence, selectivequotation often makes him seem enslaved to one or other of these attitudes. Andothers who have made real efforts to come to terms with the conflict have beenmisrepresented in the same sort of way.No malice is needed for this distortion. Even given goodwill, the difficulty isimmense. What is needed is not just a set of rules for handling factualdisputes, of the kind which is recognized as part of scientific training. Sincethis vast issue involves our whole view of our place in the world, discussion ofit calls out and reflects the whole shape of the character. The way in which wetreat it inevitably reveals our weaknesses and prejudices. Dozens of awkwardtruths about ourselves are relevant to this subject; our avoidance of any ofthem projects a distortion on to the screen of our theory. Obviously we shallnever escape their influence. What is needed is the kind of effort which Darwinmade to become aware of them, to separate them from the more narrowly factualissues, and to watch out for their dangers.Am I exaggerating these dangers? Some physical scientists are likely to feelthat the kind of thing I have been describing does indeed happen in otherdisciplines, notably in the humanities, but does not normally happen in theirown, and cannot really have mattered to Darwin. I only wish that they wereright.The destructive message of this book is a somewhat dismal one. It concerns thesort of trouble which arises when, with writers less careful than Darwin, thedramas take over. About evolution, theory itself has again and again beendistorted by biases flowing from over-simple, unbalanced world-pictures. Thetrouble does not, of course, lie in mere wish-fulfilment of the obvious kindwhich paints the world as we should like it to be. It involves being obsessed bya picture so colourful and striking that it numbs thought about the evidencerequired to support it. Standards of proof then fall headlong.Half the trouble of course takes place out of sight, in the mere choice ofproblems, in taking some things for granted and being quite unpersuadable aboutothers, in unconsciously placing the burden of proof on one’s opponents, andsometimes in pure tribal feeling which confines one’s attention to thefellow-specialists who already share one’s premisses. Of course it is true thatthe resulting mistakes are usually not as bad as the exaggerated forms in whichthey are reflected by outsiders, and also that they are ‘not part of science’.Mistakes never are. But since what is needed in order to correct them is not toavoid all world-pictures altogether, but to form better ones, this whole processis a matter for real scientific concern.False LightsThere are two distortions in particular which will mainly concern us in thisbook, and they had better be indicated, however crudely, right away. Neither isnew; both have often been denounced. But both persist, not just in the minds ofoutsiders ignorant of evolutionary theory, but also in those of many scientistswho develop and expound it.The first is the better known and the more obviously pernicious. It is the‘Social Darwinist’ idea, expressed by Ghiselin, that life has beenscientifically proved to be essentially competitive, in some sense which exposesall social feeling as somehow mere humbug and illusion. The phrase ‘survival ofthe fittest’ has been used, ever since Herbert Spencer first coined it, todescribe an individualistic law showing such things as co-operation, love andaltruism to be unreal, a law which (somewhat mysteriously) both demands andpredicts that they should always give way to self-interest.This has often been exposed as nonsense. Since many very successful species ofsocial animals, including our own, have evolved these traits, have survived bythem and continue to live by them, their unreality cannot be the message ofevolutionary theory. But because of its strong dramatic force, as well asvarious political uses, this notion persists through repeated attempts tocorrect it, and often twists up the ideas even of those who think they arehelping to get rid of it. It is especially troublesome in the Americansociobiology debate, a topic to which I shall have to give a ratherdisproportionate amount of attention, simply because its wide publicity makesit, just now, the most prominent hotbed of noisy errors about evolution.The second main distortion may be called Panglossism, or the Escalator Fallacy.It is the idea that evolution is a steady, linear upward movement, a singleinexorable process of improvement, leading (as a disciple of Herbert Spencer’sput it) ‘from gas to genius’5 [22_Notes.html#fn-c01_en5] and beyond into somesuperhuman spiritual stratosphere. This idea, first put forward by Jean-BaptisteLamarck at the beginning of the nineteenth century,6 [22_Notes.html#fn-c01_en6]convinced Spencer instantly and completely.It did not convince Darwin at all. He thought it vacuous, pointed out theobscurity of the metaphor ‘higher’, and relied on no such paid-up cosmicinsurance policy to bail out the human race. He developed his own view ofselection on the humbler model of a bush – a rich radiation of varying forms, inwhich human qualities cannot, any more than any others, determine a generaldirection for the whole.Here too, however, what he rejected has been kept by many people as a centralfeature of the idea of evolution and seen as a key part of ‘Darwinism’. Stillunsupported by argument, it too continues to produce some extremely strangetheorizing, and in its less obvious way also to do a great deal of damage. Thesetwo kinds of drama are, in fact, the shapes into which the two main strands offeeling about evolution naturally develop, if they are not held in balance andforced to correct each other. They are the hypertrophied forms of cosmicoptimism and cosmic pessimism respectively. Since both these moods are common,theory-builders often oscillate between them rather casually, and produce viewswhich owe something to both. Unluckily, this is not the same thing as thesynthesis which Darwin attempted. It can merely give us the worst of bothworlds.The Fear of BiologyMelodramas like these, especially the ‘Social Darwinist’ or Spencerist one,account, I am sure, for the strong objection which many people still feel toseriously taking the theory of evolution on board at all. This objection is notconfined to Biblical creationists. Certainly the persistence of creationism,leading to a recent expansion and even the conversion of a few physicalscientists, itself indicates something beyond mere passive conservatism. Butwhat is much more interesting and important is the subtler resistance stillcommon among social scientists.This is not a denial of evolutionary theory itself, which is usually conceded ascorrect in its own sphere, but a steady rejection of any attempt to use it inthe interpretation of human affairs. A sanitary cordon is erected at thefrontier between the physical and social sciences, at which biologicalexplanations generally and evolutionary ones in particular still tend to beturned back, marked with an official stamp which may read ‘Fascist’, ‘Racist’,‘Galtonist’, ‘Innatist’, ‘Biological Determinist’, or at times, most grimly ofall, merely ‘Biological’.This habit is fortunately on the way out, and a modest two-way traffic does nowgo on, to the general advantage. But a good deal of work is still needed toexplain – as is always necessary in these cases – the distortions which gaverise to the prejudice in the first place, and just why they are not actuallypart of biological science. That is a main business of this book.Tribally speaking, this debate is conceived as a border dispute between socialscientists and biologists. It can appear to be one between their respectivesciences themselves. Since, however, sciences cannot oppose each other in thisway, there is plainly a need for rethinking and restatement when theirrepresentatives start doing so. It is helpful, I think, to begin by looking atthe historical reasons why inter-science war at this point did not surprise orshock people as much as it ought to have done.In the first place, within the social sciences themselves, disputes about thesources of human conduct have often been somewhat aggressively and competitivelyconducted. There is a real difficulty in grasping the vastness of the subject,in seeing that distinct insights need not be rivals, but can explain differentaspects of life, and can eventually be compatible. In this way physicalexplanations have chronically been seen as competing with psychological ones,introspection as competing with laboratory work, observation with experiment,interest in heredity with interest in environment, history with science, andanswers to large questions with answers to small ones.In this competitive atmosphere, the standing of biological explanations was alsomuch injured by their repeated misuse during the nineteenth century for sinisterpolitical purposes. Starting from Francis Galton’s eugenic proposals to weed outthe lower classes, as well as non-European races, by selective breeding,oppressors repeatedly invoked the name and prestige of biology, along withSocial Darwinist distortions of evolutionary theory, to justify exploitation.The notion of fitness was twisted to preserve white dominance in the UnitedStates through so-called intelligence testing, bolstered by false, butseductive, biological theories.7 [22_Notes.html#fn-c01_en7] It also figured inthe ravings of the Nazis.Thus biology itself became associated in the public mind with a string ofindefensible right-wing positions. Since these people’s biological theories wereusually false, based on views of (for instance) race which were not biologicalat all, this hijacking ought no more to have discredited genuine biology thanthe errors of alchemists discredit chemistry. The association is a quiteexternal one. It is in fact just as easy to misuse environmentalist theories foroppressive purposes. For instance, J. B. Watson, the founder of behaviouristpsychology, did this in recommending his perverse and inhuman system ofbabycare.8 [22_Notes.html#fn-c01_en8] And the whole notion of natural humantastes which rulers must not distort or ignore – a notion on which we all restwhen we resist bad institutions as ‘inhuman’ – presupposes a firm biologicalbasis in inherited human nature.Marx’s central notion of ‘dehumanization’ rests on this plinth, and his attackson the notion of human nature are simply aimed at inadequate forms of it. Ifthere were no such thing as human nature, the objections to a Brave New Worldexistence could never arise. Conditioning is the tool of tyrants. Natural,inborn human spontaneity, seeking a more satisfying life even among people whohave been brutally conditioned to know nothing but slavery, is the source ofresistance to tyranny. It is the myths, not real biological theory, which haveassociated our evolutionary origins with injustice and oppression. That is whyit is so important to expose them.This irrelevance of bad political doctrines to real biological theory has beenthe theme of a great deal that I have written, and I must not repeat thosediscussions here.9 [22_Notes.html#fn-c01_en9] One feature of the presentenquiry, however, is different. Previously I have been largely occupied withmyths which seemed to be deforming the social sciences; here I deal mainly withones infesting the physical ones. I hope it will be clear, in the one case as inthe other, that this is no more an attack on those sciences themselves than anexposure of forged money is an attack on the Mint or a denunciation of quackremedies is an attack on the medical profession. I have been heartened by thereadiness of a number of scientific colleagues to make this distinction, and Ivery much hope that readers will be willing to put themselves to the sametrouble, for which I thank them."},{"pageContent":" 2 Do Science and Religion Compete?If a general council of the Church Scientific had been held at that time, weshould have been condemned by an overwhelming majority.T. H. HuxleyThe Wilberforce LegendPolitical feuds, however, are hardy plants, very difficult to weed out of acontroversy once they have got into it. And this particular controversy wasalready distorted by animosities drawn from an older warfare, that which hasbeen conceived as raging between science and religion in the nineteenth century,centrally over the theory of evolution. That seems to have been the point atwhich the idea of evolution, and to some extent of science generally, began tobe seen as immoral and inhuman, while scientists began, in reply, to see notionsof morality and humanity as anti-scientific and obscurantist. The whole idea ofthis warfare is a very strange one, and it is part of our business in this bookto understand it better.It is very interesting to notice how far later tradition has exaggerated theVictorian dispute and distorted our view of its nature. As James Moore hasshown,1 [22_Notes.html#fn-c02_en1] it certainly did not appear at the time asraging between science and religion, but as cutting straight across both.Darwin’s most serious opponents by far were the official scientificestablishment of his day and many of his supporters, such as Charles Kingsleyand H. G. Baden-Powell, were clergymen – as were, after all, many of thosescientists who had already established the far from Biblical age of the earth.More remarkably still, however, it turns out that the one thing we all thoughtwe did know about, the famous confrontation between Thomas Henry Huxley, actingas ‘Darwin’s bull-dog’, and Bishop Wilberforce in 1860, is something that we donot know about at all. Contemporary accounts do not bear out the version of itwe were brought up on. Wilberforce (it emerges) certainly did not just waffleand appeal to irrelevant feeling. He made clear, forceful and pertinentscientific criticisms, which were seen as such by Darwin himself. (Darwin atonce began experimental work to answer them.) Wilberforce was, after all, notpresent as a bishop but as a scientist, vice-president of the British Academy,with good ornithological work to his credit, and spokesman for Sir Richard Owen,the greatest anatomist of the day. In his review of the Origin just before, hehad written:We are too loyal pupils of inductive philosophy to start back from anyconclusion by reason of its strangeness. … We have no sympathy with those whoobject to any facts or alleged facts in Nature, or to any inference logicallydeduced from them, because they believe them to contradict what it appears tothem is taught by Revelation.2 [22_Notes.html#fn-c02_en2]He could scarcely have dropped these principles at Oxford without attractingcomment. Just what he did finally say to upset Huxley we shall probably nevernow know. Neither his remark nor Huxley’s reply was sufficiently noticed to bereported. The man who stood out at the time as having actually answeredWilberforce was the botanist Joseph Hooker. But his answers were, of course,limited by the fact that Darwin’s theory at that time really did need a greatdeal more evidence and basic thought before it could be defended againstcritical scientists.No dishonesty on the part of Huxley and his friends was needed to generate thelater version. It grew naturally out of the hindsight of the victors. Theysimply forgot what Wilberforce had said. His scientific objections, which hadbeen serious and necessary in their time, were dropped from memory once they hadbeen answered. And all of us find it much easier to remember our owncontribution to a debate than other people’s. It is unfortunate, however, thattwo of Huxley’s later preoccupations contributed to distort his memory of thisactually rather trifling affair, and to make it look to him like a holy war. Hespent much of his later life campaigning to establish professionalism inscience, to move the occupational image away from that of a broad ‘naturalist’,which was how Darwin always described himself – a gentleman living on hisprivate means or working as a clergyman – to that of a full-time, fully paid,specialized ‘scientist’. And he also found himself, as an important Victoriansage, saying a great deal about the purpose and meaning of life which broughthim into conflict with the Church. Wilberforce therefore personified bothHuxley’s hates by being an amateur scientist as well as a bishop. This veryfact, however, points to a paradox in Huxley’s own position. In his owninterests, he by no means confined himself to being merely an anatomist, or evenmerely an evolutionist. His thoughts ranged remarkably widely, and he certainlysaw no need to draw a sharp line between even their widest ranges and hisscientific views. He thought as a whole person, a person who was a scientist.And it seemed to him that it was essentially scientific business which broughthim into conflict with religion. But on the narrower notions of science whichhave come out of his work, this can scarcely be right. Can there really be sucha conflict?Clashes Due to TrespassIn what sense can two such abstract entities as science and religion (ormorality) be said to clash? Mere accidental personal feuds between theirfollowers are not enough to justify this language. They can surely only clashwhere they compete, where they represent rival attempts to perform the samefunction. How far, if at all, can science and religion do this?There is, of course, a well-known set of cases where they seem to do it, namely,where religion is invoked against science on a point of empirical fact. Theliteral acceptance of archaic Biblical ideas on cosmology is an obvious case.Creationists who attempt this are taking on a scientific task, as indeed theynow recognize by their preference for talk of ‘creation science’. But theirreasons for undertaking it flow not from religion as such, nor even fromChristianity, but from their own peculiar conception of the Bible as literallytrue and divinely dictated.Other Christians object to this view strongly, on the obvious grounds that it isneedless, and moreover that the Bible, in spite of its grandeur, contains manythings which conflict not just with science, but with morality, with history,with common sense or with each other. If there were a god who had dictated thewhole of it, he would certainly not be one we ought to worship. Biblical writersseem, then, to have been as fallible and imperfect as other human beings, andmoreover to have used – as would naturally be expected – a mythical andmetaphorical way of writing where that was suitable, instead of making the quiteirrelevant attempt to be modern physical scientists. The central objections tofundamentalist literalism are religious, moral and historical ones. If they areright, this is a case where ‘religion’ does not clash with science unlesssomething has gone wrong with it already on its own terms. The religion whichdoes clash with science has left its own sphere, for bad reasons, to intrude ona scientific one. It is bad religion.This kind of case is relatively familiar and well understood. In this book,however, we shall be more concerned with the opposite kind, which has been lessnoticed. We shall look at doctrines which are believed to be scientific, but arenot actually so, and whose persuasiveness seems to be due to their serving someof the functions of a religion, even though they are seen by their promoters asbeing hostile to ‘religion’ as such. Sometimes indeed they are put forwardconsciously as substitutes for religion, able to replace it in publicacceptance. This project would hardly make sense if they were not seen asperforming in some sense the same function, that is as being somehow religiousdoctrines in their own right, aimed essentially at the spiritual nourishment andsalvation of the human race.The effect is doubly strange. These doctrines not only lack suitable argumentsto recommend them in their new, salvationary role. They also conflict with thegenuinely scientific theories which are supposed to provide their roots and tojustify their name. Like ‘creationist science’ they offend against the laws oftheir country of origin even before attempting to conquer a wider territory. Badreligion is being answered by bad science. If we ask ‘by what myths do peopletoday support themselves?’ we shall often find that they do it by myths whichthey wrongly suppose to be part of science.The Division of SpheresDoes it follow, then, that religion and science never conflict so long as bothare properly conducted? That would be a bold claim. We shall need to have a muchclearer idea of both entities before we can approach it. But it does seem plainthat many of their current supposed clashes are produced by confusion. That veryclear-headed geneticist, Theodosius Dobzhansky, made a useful suggestion fordividing their spheres: ‘Science and religion deal with different aspects ofexistence. If one dares to overschematize for the sake of clarity, one may saythat these are the aspect of fact and the aspect of meaning.’3[22_Notes.html#fn-c02_en3] Since the notion that facts are the province ofscience is very widely accepted, this seems a reasonable suggestion. What,however, is the province of meaning?Meaning and FaithMeaning is perhaps best thought of as the way in which facts connect to formwhat I have called world-pictures – that is the underlying systems of thought bywhich we order our experience. A meaningless ‘brute’ fact is one which we cannotfit into this system. And, if the system itself falls apart, that is when we saythat our life has become meaningless.Experience is of course too complicated for these systems ever to become neat orcomplete. All the same, each of them has some kind of a central region. The moreclosely any particular fact is linked to this centre, and the more light itthrows on the interconnections of the whole, the more meaning, significance orimportance it has. This system, moreover, is as a whole related to purpose – ourown purposes and others of which we are aware.Quite modestly, people often find plenty of meaning in their lives if they areworking for their own purposes in harmony with those around them. In thatsituation, it is often artificial and misleading to ask whom a purpose belongsto. Each directly desires the satisfaction of the others and the fulfilment ofjoint projects. If we ask for a wider context – which many of us do – we beginto build wider intellectual systems, either just for greater completeness or toreconcile clashing elements within the system which we have already. All ourmore ambitious enquiries flow outwards from this central region.Dobzhansky is surely right that this is the kind of work to which religion ingeneral contributes. What, however, distinguishes religion from other sources ofmeaning? What makes a system a religious system, and how many religions arethere?This question can of course be dealt with in a very summary way by justreferring to common practice. Thus, in the last war, when recruits were beingasked for their religion on entering the forces, one of them was heard to reply,‘Marxist–Leninist–Dialectical–Materialist’. ‘Can’t spell it,’ said the sergeant,‘put him down C. of E.’ On this trouble-saving system, the title of this book isjust a confusion. But this method leaves us with some serious questionsunanswered. We know what the recruit meant. He was speaking of the faith helived by. A faith is not primarily a factual belief, the acceptance of a fewextra propositions like ‘God exists’ or ‘there will be a revolution’. It israther the sense of having one’s place within a whole greater than oneself, onewhose larger aims so enclose one’s own and give them point that sacrifice for itmay be entirely proper.This sense need not involve any extra factual beliefs at all. Marxism does not,nor does Taoism. Both call centrally for changes in attitude to the facts onealready accepts – changes in connection, in emphasis, in attention, inselection, in the meaning and importance attached to particulars – in short, achanged world-picture. Sometimes changed opinions about facts will follow. ThusMarxism (but not Taoism) calls for a new set of expectations about the future.But even when there are such new opinions, it is not they but the attitude whichgenerates them that is central. Converts who only have the new factual beliefsand not the appropriate attitudes will not last long.This kind of faith is plainly something widespread and very important in ourlives. It need not be formalized at all. People, in fact, often do not noticethat they have it until whatever they have faith in – perhaps their culture ortheir occupation – is threatened. But almost everyone, however sceptical oruninterested in religion and metaphysics, has faith in something. Againstreligion, faith in science or in reason is often invoked, and these go farbeyond the existing successes. People have faith in humanity, in democracy, inart, in medicine, in economics or in western civilization, in trade – even, itseems, in money, which is as odd an entity as any that religion has yetinvented.These faiths are not themselves religions, but they are the seedbed ofreligions. In cultures where a strong, dominant religion already rules, newminor faiths are simply absorbed into it as they arise. They are not usuallynoticed unless they are so distinctive as to demand widespread change. But inour own culture, where many people officially have no religion at all, and thosewho have can chop and change, new faiths have much more scope and can becomemore distinctive. They are hungrily seized on by people whose lives lackmeaning. When this happens, there arise at once, unofficially and spontaneously,many elements which we think of as characteristically religious. We begin, forinstance, to find priesthoods, prophecies, devotion, bigotry, exaltation,heresy-hunting and sectarianism, ritual, sacrifice, fanaticism, notions of sin,absolution and salvation, and the confident promise of a heaven in the future.Auguste Comte, the founder of positivism, whose ‘religion of humanity’ displayedthese and many other overtly traditional features, seems to have been the firstto link the promised blessings of the future firmly to the progress of science,not just as a source of material benefits, but as providing in its devotees anew and more exalted type of human being. He does not lack followers.Secular FaithsMarxism and evolutionism, the two great secular faiths of our day, display allthese religious-looking features. They have also, like the great religions andunlike more casual local faiths, large-scale, ambitious systems of thought,designed to articulate, defend and justify their ideas – in short, ideologies.Is there still some plain, simple mark by which we can establish theirnon-religious character?This really is not so easy a question as it may look. It is certainly not enoughto say that they do not involve belief in God. Taoism does not do this either,nor does Buddhism in its original form. And the question whether the Buddha isnow ‘a god’ is not a simple one at all. He is, after all, to be sought and foundwithin us. Moreover, where there are ‘gods’, their nature varies enormously.They certainly need not be creators. The world is often held to be timeless, orto have some other origin. Neither, on the other hand, does religion necessarilyinvolve the immortality of the soul. Judaism in its early form does not seem tohave involved human survival after death. Even for Buddhism, the soul willeventually be dispersed into its elements. And so on.The reason why it seems worth while to refuse to draw a firm line here, and togo on considering these borderline areas impartially, is that where religiouselements arise outside their familiar limits, we are liable to miss the specialshapes which they contribute to the systems they affect. For this reason, Ithink that to say that Marxism or evolutionism, or indeed art or science, isserving as a religion, can be a useful way of speaking today. It is not likesaying that golf is someone’s religion, which is probably just a joke, and atmost means only that it is the most important thing in his life, the thing towhich the rest gives place. Here there is not likely to be any system of thoughtarguing that golf ought to take precedence, and giving reasons why it should doso. Moreover, devotion to golf is likely to have only a negative effect on thoseparts of life which take place off the golf-course. It leads to their beingneglected, not to their being differently conducted. But the other candidates weare now considering do have those thought-systems and that wider impact. Theyare, not accidentally but by their very nature, dominant creeds, explicit faithsby which people live and to which they try to convert others. They tend to alterthe world.What is the general standing of such secular faiths? When they first began toappear in the nineteenth century, they had an obvious attraction for idealisticpeople because they were not then tainted by any such grim record of politicalmisuses as then attached to Christianity. By now we know their blackpossibilities better. But their appeal, which rests on their power to make senseof a threatening and chaotic world by dramatizing it, has certainly not grownless. That makes them more frightening still. What is to be done about them?Academic thought has in general responded to them suspiciously but negatively,by territorial arguments designed to rule them out of its province. From thephilosophical end, the notion of a ‘naturalistic fallacy’ or supposed logicalflaw invalidating all argument from facts to values was thought to explode them.From the factual end, the other half of the drawbridge was pulled in.Positivists deliberately narrowed the notion of ‘science’ to mean only theestablishment of particular facts through experiment, excluding the widerthinking out of which the general questions arose. Karl Popper’s rather extremeand simple negative version of this view, in which even the establishing of afact dwindled to the more modest falsification of a particular hypothesis andtheories to collections of facts, became an orthodoxy among scientists eager todefend their territory against invasion by non-specialist thinkers.4[22_Notes.html#fn-c02_en4] But this ruling, as well as the corresponding oneabout moral philosophy, was quite unrealistically wide. Cut off like this fromthe main body of thought, neither study makes much sense.The Interconnectedness of Facts and ValuesNeither facts nor values can be properly conceived in this drastic isolationfrom each other and from the central conceptual area which connects them. At thescientific end, this became clear as soon as Thomas Kuhn drew attention to themass of very complex conceptual apparatus which needed to be used and taken forgranted if anybody was even to start framing scientific hypotheses.5[22_Notes.html#fn-c02_en5] Science is not just a formless mass of experimentaldata; it is a system of thought in which they are ranged, a system whichconnects with the rest of our thinking.Equally at the ethical end, as soon as the euphoria produced by the prospect ofbarring thought from morals had passed off, it grew clear that the idea ofcompletely abstract ‘values’ conferred by arbitrary choice was an unreal one. Wecan value things only in a context which makes our valuing intelligible. Andthis valuing is not just a flat vote for or against them, a general ruling thatthey are good or bad. It is always a much more specific response – a responseappropriate to some particular quality, to (say) a certain kind of meanness orgenerosity, fairness or unfairness, kindness or brutality.6[22_Notes.html#fn-c02_en6] These qualities in their turn are not justarbitrarily connected with the situations they belong to. Though there areborderline cases – as there are with other qualities – there are also alwayscentral, typical ones; cases which we would naturally cite if we wanted toexplain the very notion of these qualities – cases where we quite properly ask‘what on earth would you count as meanness or brutality if not this?’Certainly the word that we use, and the special thought that goes with it,belongs to our own culture, and the general capacity for the reaction itexpresses belongs to our species. But this does not make them arbitrary. It isnot an arbitrary fact about any of us that we belong to the culture and to thespecies that we do. That is part of our proper description. We are not juststandard, abstract minds, tossed by chance or malice on to a strange planet. Weare not even visitors from Betelgeuse. We are therefore not the aliens andgypsies that Jacques Monod calls us, but natives. Our history and biology, whichlocate us here, ensure that by the time we are called upon to do any valuing thefacts of this planet have plenty of meaning for us. They fall within a system.Through it, we do our moral thinking.Monod’s isolationist position must be examined more fully later (in chapters 9[12_Chapter9.html]–11 [14_Chapter11.html]). It has been immensely influential,not just because he was a highly distinguished molecular biologist, but becausehe put his finger on certain very painful anomalies in current notions about thefunction of science, and supplied medicines for them which have been widelyaccepted. As will become clear, I believe that these are only palliatives,concealing the true nature of the complaint, and that a much fuller diagnosis isneeded.For the moment, however, we are dealing with that aspect of moral scepticismwhich is grounded in philosophy – with the contention that thought concernsitself only with facts, leaving values to be dealt with by feeling, or by somekind of inarticulate decision in which the intellect is useless. That we are nothelpless and inarticulate in this way becomes obvious on the many occasions whenthat thinking goes wrong – when we fall into moral difficulties and confusions.Faced (for instance) with a clash between two cultures, or between justice andmercy, or between honesty and kindness, we do not just toss up. We do not treatthe issue as an arbitrary one, like having to choose between two unknownrestaurants for our dinner. We continue, however weakly and blunderingly, thekind of work which has built up our standards in the first place. We go onthinking. Arguments about this kind of problem fill our literature, andconstantly increase our insights. The rules for conducting them are quite ascomplex as those of scientific reasoning, though naturally quite different.Neither in science nor in morals is it easy to find cases of perfect,irrefutable reasoning on difficult subjects. But in both it is quite easy tofind cases of bad reasoning and to say roughly why they are bad and what sort ofthing needs to be done to make them better. In this way we develop a range ofbetter and worse cases, and gradually work out the standards which underlie thatrange. In moral questions – and indeed in all practical questions – changingcircumstances continually alter the problems, which does make work on them moredifficult than it is in science. But that is quite another thing from making itimpossible.Faced with a dilemma, we do not expect an infallible oracle. What we do is tolook for the central considerations on both sides, and for the main outlines ofa conceptual scheme which will enable us to weigh them against each other. Thisis enough to get us started. If we do not have this much material for aworld-picture, we shall be paralysed for ordinary practical dilemmas as well asfor moral ones, and our life will grind to a halt. If we do have it, we canstart work, groping outwards till we find more and more connections which lightup the subject more fully.In this way, communal conceptual schemes are forged, by which we can carry onmoral business. Though they are always inadequate and constantly need change orcorrection, they are workable. Without them, more ambitious schemes could neverget started. They supply the models and standards for all the more abstract,limited, specialized, artificial ways of thinking which we patent for particularpurposes in special branches of study.It is not inside any of these special branches, but in the outside, rougher,more general intellectual region, as sharply excluded from ‘anti-naturalist’philosophy as from Popperian science, that we shall have to work if we want tomake some sense of ideologies – or indeed, more widely, to understand thevarious elements in the notions of science and religion and how they arerelated. This is not a region outside all systematic enquiry. Much worse, it isone where disciplines overlap and none quite fits, where we need more than onekind of language and more than one kind of method. Whose business is it? Whereis its specialist? A word must be said about this in the next chapter."},{"pageContent":" 3 Demarcation DisputesCursed be he that removeth his neighbour’s landmark.Book of Common PrayerBetter and Worse FaithsWe need, then, to start by resisting unrealistic scepticism. We do have thisgeneral capacity for making sense of our moral ideas and for explaining ourjudgments to one another. We are therefore not actually helpless when it comesto evaluating faiths and ideologies. We can, for instance, separate the variouselements in a faith and approve of some of them while disapproving of others.And for this we can give our reasons. We are not reduced to the mere legalisticmanoeuvre of outlawing them wholesale from learned life by saying that they arenot science.Most of human thought which has a practical bearing is not science either. Thisdoes not place it beyond criticism. Most moral thinking, in fact, deals in someway with connections between facts and values. That can be done well or badly.What is wrong with bad ideologies is not that they are trying to do something ofthis kind, but that they are doing it wrong. Their selection both of facts andof values is a bad one, leading to distortions at both ends.If, therefore, we want to pin down what is wrong with each of them, we need tosurvey its field as a whole. In order to distinguish bad faiths from the morereputable ones just mentioned – from faith in humanity, say, or in democracy orart or science – we have to take their arguments seriously and locate theirfaults. We cannot just dismiss them in advance because they lie outside science.The arguments for our own faiths, including faith in science itself, lie outsidescience too. If we have the impression that our own faith needs no argument,being simply self-evident, this is merely a dogmatic slumber. We are resting onthe laurels of those who, in the past, have with great controversial effortestablished the value of what we now take for granted.In the case of democracy, we are profiting from the stupendous spadework of theAthenians and the great Enlightenment thinkers. In the case of science, we owe alot to Aristotle, but the immense depth of modern veneration and confidence,centring above all on physics, comes from Descartes. If any of us were nowcalled upon to do this work again for ourselves, arguing to convince someonefrom another planet or culture, we would be in deep trouble. We do not encompassall these arguments, any more than even the most comprehensive scientistencompasses all the arguments of the neighbouring specialities on which his ownmust rely. Faith in the institution as a whole, and in most of itspractitioners, is a necessity.But this does not mean that the arguments are not there. Once some centralpresupposition of the system is questioned, and we grasp the objection beingmade to it, we can take up the floorboards and see what is wrong. To do this, wemust at once face the important question, ‘for what have you faith in this?’Most kinds of faith are specific and limited; they can be justified for certainpurposes but not for others. It is right to have faith in a car as a means oftransport, but not as a divinity.When we look consciously at the arguments by which we would need to justify aparticular faith this usually becomes obvious. One kind of faith will, ifexpanded without limit, compete with another. The enterprise of justifying anygiven kind therefore leads almost inevitably into a general discussion of ourdifferent aims and the priorities among them. And this is a generalphilosophical topic. It is not an internal one to be settled by the faith whichis trying to expand.Thus, people today who have a specially strong faith in science – expressed byspeaking of the ‘omnicompetence of science’ and claiming that it is the solelegitimate intellectual method open to humanity – are not themselves merelytalking science. They are stating a very bizarre position in metaphysics. Theyare out-Descartesing Descartes, who did indeed claim that physics was in somesense omni-competent for understanding the physical world, but still thought itquite irrelevant to conscious subjects, and grasped the need to use othermethods there. The claim that the methods of physics are everywhere appropriatecannot be justified by Descartes’s position that what physics tells us about thephysical world is the fullest and clearest truth about it. (Indeed, thatposition may quite sensibly be taken to mean that what we mean by ‘the physicalworld’ simply is the abstraction described by physics. The biological, chemicaland historical worlds are then seen as distinct, non-competing abstractions.)Neither can the special claim for the methods of physics be justified from theposition of modern physicalists – philosophers, operating a good deal moresubtly than Descartes, who hold that the physical world is indeed the only realone and that there is no need to posit a separate soul. They see how wild itwould be to take this as meaning that, at the level where we actually have tolive and think, immensely abstract concepts such as those of physics could beusefully deployed at all, let alone replace all other concepts.1[22_Notes.html#fn-c03_en1] To argue in support of this strange claim itschampions would need both a well worked-out, convincing set of examples and aquite new range of metaphysical arguments. This need itself seems enough to showthat physical science is not in the required sense ‘omnicompetent’. Nor is therethe slightest need to expect that it should be. Inflated claims of this kind arenever called for; they are irrelevant to the true point and dignity of anenquiry.Vastness and SpecializationWhen we investigate the claims of this or that faith or ideology, then, we donot do so in a vacuum. We need to consider its relation to the other centralinterests, institutions and belief-systems among which it operates, and relateits claims to theirs. The work is inescapably vast. It has become necessary,however, at a time when all academic enquiries are withdrawing their frontiers,when the trend to increased specialization is becoming accepted not just as afact but as a gain, and when for the first time it is beginning to be accountedcreditable for learned people to reject questions of burning general interest.Huxley’s trap has closed on us. It is no accident, of course, that thesecontrary demands have coincided. The same wide increase of intellectual activitywhich has produced the specialization has also undermined traditional systems ofbelief, leaving room in each case for a dozen others to spring up in theirplace. Thus the area of difficulties is constantly expanding, just when thosestudying it have been called on, as a matter of professional pride, to give upthe telescope for the microscope, and if possible the electron microscope atthat.It is not surprising that the first and most general reaction was a defensivewithdrawal, a shutting of the academic gates on all vast and vulgar questions,an anathema on the Victorian tradition of trying to combine learning withwisdom. Sages went right out of fashion. This policy, however, turned out tohave the distressing drawback that the excluded doctrines prospered on thetreatment and simply acquired an intellectual élite of their own. There is fartoo large an educated public outside the universities today for any monopolisticban to be effective.Accordingly, academics are now getting a more open attitude. They are tending torely less on exclusion by ukase and becoming readier to try to understand thepopular doctrines. But the difficulties of this enterprise remain immense. It isno use simply to become an uncritical convert, but neither will it help toremain sharply negative, merely pointing out the doctrines’ obvious faults. Todo any good, the critic must also see why the doctrine was invented in the firstplace, and why it has been welcomed. The vast questions which it answers badlyhave to be directly faced. Better answers must be given, even if it is obviousthat they too are still thoroughly inadequate. This is not a field whereacademics can get that seductive icing on their cake – the sense of having putthings absolutely right. It is not even one where the methods to be used arealready fixed and familiar. Discipline is needed indeed, but it is thediscipline appropriate to explorers. It involves a constant sensibility tochanges of terrain, a readiness to alter one’s methods and improvise new oneswhere they are needed, combined with the capacity to see when one has stumbledinto the ancient and subtle civilization of another enquiry, and is making anass of oneself if one fails to take advantage of the techniques the inhabitantshave already developed.It is because all this is so confusing – because the rules for controversy onthese topics are so hard to grasp – that it seems worth while attending here tothe sociobiology debate. This would certainly not be worth discussing heremerely for the sake of its strictly scientific content, which is real butlimited, and of interest only in the context of many larger questions aboutevolution. The importance of the debate lies in the way in which this scientificcontent has become entangled with certain influential and emotive views aboutthe nature and destiny of our species, views of the kind which is stillofficially supposed to be kept out of scientific controversy.The position is one which is rather common today of warfare, not directlybetween academics and the outside public, but between two academic disciplines,each fired by moral and political ideologies extraneous to it and often notfully understood. The fervent opposition which the moral conflict generatesmakes it almost impossible to sort out the factual issues, and the largerquestions which lie behind both cannot be seen at all till the smoke of theclash has somehow been dissipated. At the same time, each party tends to havethe impression that it is still on academic ground, repelling a non-academicintrusion. Alien ideologies are strident and obvious; one’s own are habitual andtaken for granted. They seem academically respectable.What Sciences areThis difficulty is more serious in the physical sciences than it is in thesocial ones. For social scientists, faiths and ideologies are obviously properbusiness because they are part of the subject-matter. Social scientists, likehistorians, are called upon to discuss both influential systems of thought andthe feelings which underlie them. In order to do this, they have to be aware oftheir own attitudes. The discipline of becoming conscious of these and relatingthem to those one is discussing is a recognized part of such work; people whofail in it constantly come under criticism. The defect is common but it isuniversally recognized.For physical scientists today, this is much less true. Although unspokenattitudes to what physical science ought to be are very powerful, not much ofthem is articulated. Officially the business of science is taken to be simple –the establishment of ‘objective’ facts which look the same to everybody.Attitudes must be irrelevant to it. Background presuppositions are thereforemuch less discussed than they used to be, and what discussion there is tends tobe negative – devoted to excluding borderline areas from science.The effect is to leave many of today’s physical scientists rather unpractised ingeneral thinking, and therefore somewhat naïve and undefended againstsuperstitions which dress themselves up as science. Creationism, for instance,cuts no ice at all with humanists and social scientists. Nobody trained to thinkhistorically is in any danger of taking it seriously, least of all theologians.It makes its academic converts among chemists and physicists – sometimes,alarmingly enough, even among biologists.Equally, the attitudes which will most concern us in this book – faith in futuresuperman-building, faith in the mysterious force of bloody-minded egoism,fatalistic faith in chance, and various sub-faiths accompanying these – owetheir success to the making of scientific-sounding noises without serioussubstance. Their direct appeal is to people devoted to the glamour of physicalscience. This is a different group from that of scientists themselves, butunfortunately it overlaps with it quite widely. It covers a large and devoutpublic, including many in the social sciences, who defer on principle tophysical science as such, and suspect that, if they are not yet using itsmethods on any subject, they ought to be. The effect on that public of thesequasi-scientific superstitions, once any physical scientists take them up, cantherefore be rather serious, and their strength is remarkable.The case most publicized so far – the resurgence of Social Darwinist egoism insociobiological literature – is indeed an alarming one. Officially,sociobiological writers understand the objections to this view perfectly. Theyrehearse familiar refutations of it with references to the naturalistic fallacyand the like; they treat Social Darwinism as obsolete. But because the intenselycompetitive attitude from which it originally sprang is still their own, becausecompetition is what they live and breathe, because they are totallyculture-bound and do not know that human life can proceed in any other way, theycontinue to project this picture on to the cosmos and to treat it as part ofscience.It is probably a considerable misfortune for the English-speaking world that ourword ‘science’ does not, like the German ‘Wissenschaft’ mean simply a learnedenquiry generally, but the physical sciences in particular with a rather shakyannexe built on for other studies so far as they resemble these. Since the word‘scientific’ remains a title of honour, the idea that there is something wrongwhen (say) anthropology or psychology fails to look like physics is stillinfluential. Even biology is constantly finding itself out of line. Accordingly,social scientists have been rather willing to accept, as the price of admissionto the fold, irrelevant standards held up to them from the physical side.In particular, they have often pursued a very powerful and confused notion of‘objectivity’ as requiring, not just the avoidance of personal bias, but arefusal to talk or think about subjective factors at all. The word ‘subjective’then becomes a simple term of abuse directed at any mention of thoughts orfeelings, and the word ‘objective’ a potent compliment for any approach whichignores them. This policy produced extraordinary distortions in Watsonianbehaviourist psychology, where the study of conscious subjects was supposed tobe carried on ‘objectively’ – that is as if they were something quite different,namely lifeless physical objects.There is now a considerable move away from this bizarre and unprofitableapproach, though there is still a great deal of confusion about how close themethods of the different sciences ought to be. But an effect which remains withus is that the unaware and uncritical attitude to faiths and ideologies whichwas licensed for the physical sciences has infected social scientists too. BothJ. B. Watson and his successor in the behaviourist tradition, B. F. Skinner, inpreaching their colourful versions of behaviourism, took for granted that itsstudied neglect of subjective factors made it so obviously ‘scientific’ that itscarcely needed any other recommendation. Their own very peculiar anddistinctive ideology was never brought properly into the open or called on tojustify itself in the way which such very general doctrines need.Paradigms and PresuppositionsThe fact that this and so many other attitudes, many of them very strange andcertainly most of them mutually incompatible, have been taken for granted as‘scientific’ and therefore self-evident by their various promoters surely makesit clear that more care is needed here. Either (one would say) scientists need,simply for their own work, to study controversial issues and methods which arenot part of science, or the notion of science itself needs to be widened againto include them.Modern usage seems to make the second alternative rather difficult. It is veryinteresting that Thomas Kuhn, in pointing out the importance of the widerbackground concepts, firmly gave the name ‘normal science’ to the limited workwhich proceeds according to pre-set plans without raising new questions. InKuhn’s language, original thinking is an abnormal activity for scientists.This seems too depressed a viewpoint. No doubt it is true that the highlyoriginal thinking which produces a new and necessary paradigm is abnormal,because it is obviously rare. But what about the degree of awareness which isneeded to understand properly the existing concepts, to notice aspects of themwhich are beginning to make trouble, and to spot the occasions when rank erroris creeping in under their cloak? This – which should surely be normal activityfor a scientist – is a skill which calls for some grasp of what the attitudescurrently taken for granted are. It therefore demands an understanding of whatthey are not – of the possible alternatives to them and the reasons which mightsupport those alternatives. It requires that current dogmas are not taken forgranted as eternal and self-evident, but used as stages in a process carried onby fallible and constantly erring human beings. Current assumptions need to bemade consciously, not treated as things already proved.Considering the enormous emphasis laid at present on the importance of momentousscientific discoveries and the general high expectations for the scientificfuture, this flexibility might not seem too much to ask for. But in fact it hasproved difficult for such suggestions to be taken on board as anything butradically destructive. There is considerable resistance still to changing theseductive notion of ‘modernity’ which ruled early in this century and still doesrule in many areas – a notion of a single dark past, described vaguely as‘medieval’, due to be destroyed and give way once and for all to a ‘modern’present which will be final and never need changing. Modern architecture is onedismal case of this strange delusion; successive modern scientificworld-pictures have provided another. In theory, dogmatic propagandists for anyone of such pictures are resigned to being overtaken one day by the next Nobelprize-winner who will change it. But they expect this to be a local operation,the supplying of new facts. What they naturally cannot envisage is the defect intheir own general background thinking which will make a new approach necessary.Kuhn called this background thinking a paradigm. This term has proved useful buttantalizing; there has been much dispute about how to fix its limits. This isnot surprising. The term is essentially open-ended. What it covers ranges faroutside the strict limits of science, covering everything that Collingwood sousefully called ‘presuppositions’. And since there are not, as Collingwoodsupposed, any ‘absolute presuppositions’ – since everything involves somethingelse – this takes us an indefinite distance into the realms of the motives andimagination. The example of the dramas linked to the idea of evolution surelymakes this clear. If we are not prepared to criticize these imaginativeframeworks directly in their own suitable terms, we do not stand a chance ofgetting the facts straight.The Proper Role of ScepticismThis by no means commits us to helpless scepticism; indeed, it is the onlypossible remedy for it. It is not that the whole controversy is an arbitrarysocial construction. There is a real, vast, factual issue about the origin anddevelopment of terrestrial life, a huge set of interlinked historical andscientific questions with right and wrong answers. Things did actually happen insome specific way or other, which human thought is powerless to change, andthere are genuinely better or worse methods by which we can approach, or deviatefrom, a tolerably correct general account of the whole process, and of suchparts of it as give us adequate data. We are not free to make it all up. Buteven where we have plenty of data, and still more where we are starved of them,the way in which we describe it does depend also on our own approach. And themeaning which we then give to our description, the implications which we find init for the rest of life, the deeper message which we take it to hold, depends onthis still more heavily. From these flow both practical principles and furtherfactual beliefs.These things, unfortunately, are not marked off from a set of narrowly andindisputably scientific items by any helpful system of labelling. The terms andconcepts used in sober, neutral areas often turn out to have other uses as well;indeed, much of their usefulness depends on their doing so, and thus suggestingwider applications. Attempts to avoid this by making all the terms technical, orexpressing everything in equations, would only hamstring thought, and would notachieve their disinfecting purpose, since the emotional attitudes attached toideas would still be there, and would only be harder to recognize if they werenot betrayed, as they often are now, by language.In recent years, sociologists of knowledge have been useful in pointing out thissort of trouble. The weakness of their work is its spasmodic exaggeration. Theytend to talk sometimes as though the facts did not exist, as though spotting amotive behind a particular line of theory settled the question of itscorrectness, or somehow prevented that question from ever arising. The weaknessof this kind of extreme relativism has been shown in many ways, notably and mostsimply through the question of whether such theories in the sociology ofknowledge are themselves ordinary scientific theories, or are somehow exemptfrom their own scrutiny. I am not now peddling any such sweeping sceptical orrelativistic enterprise. But I do want to introduce an element of moderate,selective scepticism, which will make us watch out for particular sources oferror.In particular, we need to avoid extending the confidence which is due to thecentral, well-established findings of the sciences to a vast area which has onlyan imaginative affinity with them, an area where only the name and trappings of‘science’ are present.The attitude sometimes called ‘scientism’ – a general veneration for the idea ofscience, detached from any real understanding of its methods – is at presentextremely powerful. In that attitude, the notion of the role which the scientistsees himself as playing is inextricably linked with a view of the cosmos. Therole makes sense only within a given drama, and the feelings which shape therole are inevitably projected to provide it with a suitable background.Uncontrolled indulgence in the drama enslaves one to the myth.A good example of this is Ghiselin’s story, quoted in chapter 1[04_Chapter1.html#chapter1], that ‘the economy of nature is competitive frombeginning to end’. This, though presented as a scientific finding from whichpsychological truths can be deduced, has no basis in science. It is a piece ofbogus, melodramatic, informal psychology projected both on to evolutionarytheory and on to economics. The projection on to economics is the older, anddoes of course also have a political source, as sociologists of knowledge havepointed out, in nineteenth-century justifications of the excesses of unbridledcommerce. But this does not exclude the source in individual feeling; itsupplements it. The satisfaction of appearing in the role of unmasker, and theindulgence of aggressive feelings which this particular drama allows, centrallydetermine not only the language but the choice of theory.In discussing the personal end of this interaction, I have naturally startedfrom the idea of drama. For the cosmic end, it will be more natural to startfrom the idea of myth. The two will eventually converge. And I shall suggestthat the myths involved are not distinct from each other, but combine to formsomething which can usefully be seen as a faith or even a religion. Not tocomplicate things unduly, I have made no attempt here to follow theinvestigation over the border into issues of religious thinking proper, andrelate it to existing discussions of the nature of the various religions andwhat they have in common. I have tried to proceed somewhat in the spirit of thatvery great psychologist and empiricist philosopher, William James, consideringthis borderline area as containing some varieties of religious experience whichare both striking in themselves and noteworthy now because they are practicallyinfluential. It seems to me very important that we should always be aware ofsuch things."},{"pageContent":" 4 The Irresistible EscalatorWhen the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places,seeking rest, and findeth none. Then he saith; I will return into my house fromwhence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept andgarnished. Then goeth he and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wickedthan himself, and they enter in and dwell there. And the last state of that manis worse than the first.Gospel according to St Matthew 12: 43–5The Kaleidoscope ReshakenEvolution, then, is the creation myth of our age. By telling us our origins itshapes our views of what we are. It influences not just our thought, but ourfeelings and actions too, in a way which goes far beyond its official functionas a biological theory. To call it a myth does not of course mean that it is afalse story. It means that it has great symbolic power, which is independent ofits truth.How far the word ‘religion’ is appropriate to it will of course depend on thesense we finally give to that very elastic word. In any case, however, it seemsworth while to notice the remarkable variety of elements which it covers, andtheir present strange behaviour. While traditional Christianity held thoseelements together in an apparently changeless and inevitable grouping, we didnot notice how diverse they were. But now that the violent changes of modernlife have shaken them apart, they are drifting about and cropping up inunexpected places. Ambiguity of the same fruitful but dangerous kind affects thenames of other complex human concerns – names such as morality, politics, art,sport and indeed science. This ambiguity is dangerous when we do not properlyunderstand it, when we treat these complex conceptual groupings as if they wereplain, single ideas. Confusion gets worse when displaced elements migrate fromone main grouping to another. And today, a surprising number of the elementswhich used to belong to traditional religion have regrouped themselves under theheading of science, mainly around the concept of evolution.The first thing I want to do here is to draw attention to this phenomenon, analarming one, surely, above all for those who hold that getting rid of religionis itself a prime aim of science. If the fungicide shares the vices of thefungus, something seems to have gone wrong. But the phenomenon is of widerinterest than this to all of us. Why does it happen? Why is this kind of cosmicmythology so strong and so persistent?The simplest explanation, no doubt, would be mere force of habit, thestill-surviving toxic effect of Christian conditioning. But that is not aplausible story today. The days of really confident Christian education aresimply too far behind us, and the leading myth-bearers are themselves toorebellious, too critical, too consciously and resolutely anti-Christian. If theyare indeed the mental prisoners of their opponent, in an age when fashion is ontheir side and so much change is so easily accepted, there has to be a specialreason for it. The power of these ideas still remains to be accounted for. Thisindeed is often somewhat uneasily recognized, but the explanations given for ittend to be crude and hasty. The matter is too important for this. We need verybadly to understand the influences involved.In trying to understand them we shall, I believe, do best if we detach ourselvesas far as possible from the old Voltairean notion of a ding-dong battle betweenscience and religion. Enquiring more calmly, we shall, I think, find that thereis not one all-embracing reason why religious elements persist, but manydistinct though related ones. Religion, like other complex human concerns, seemsto be built up out of a wide set of natural tendencies which can be variouslycombined, so that it itself varies enormously in character according to the wayin which we relate them. The same is true of science and also of art. Attemptsto eliminate any such main grouping merely scatter its component tendencies intheir crudest form to join other colonies. (Puritan attempts to get rid of arthave shown this very plainly.)If we want to attack the evils infesting any special grouping, we need to lookat it carefully to see just what its actual elements are at the time, and howfar they necessarily go together. Classical Greek, for instance, had no word for‘religion’ at all, and certainly arranged what we think of as its elementsdifferently from how we do. Chinese, it seems, not only has no word for‘religion’ but none for ‘God’ either, which causes difficulties formissionaries. It would be very short-sighted to suppose that this state ofaffairs flowed from an absence of what we call religion, and more enlighteningto suggest that it meant a greater pervasiveness of it, whereby it was taken forgranted all over the texture of life. The stark division of life into sacred andprofane often posited in the west has not been attempted in China. Religion isless of a detached, specialized matter.Whatever the merits and demerits of this, it is probably important for us, andespecially for those of us who distrust religion, not to suppose that currentwestern definitions of it are necessarily the last word. This is speciallyimportant in connection with those definitions devised in the nineteenth-centurypositivist tradition to show religion as a childhood stage in the development ofthe human race, something which the west was rapidly outgrowing, thoughprimitive peoples still unfortunately remained bogged down in it. More honestanthropology and history have made this tendentious, patronizing stanceimpossible today. We need a far more open mind. Perhaps indeed the concept ofreligion may be asked to look again at the Delphic inscription, ‘know thyself’.But if so, the concept of science must certainly be asked to accompany it.Pie in the Future: Prophecies and PromisesWe had better start by glancing at a few typical cases of the phenomenon inquestion: occasions when science appears to be stealing its supposed opponent’sclothes. In this chapter I shall concentrate on prophecies, because they providea specially clear example.It is a standard charge against religion that it panders to wish-fulfilment,consoling people for their present miseries by promising wonders in the future,thus dishonestly gaining support by dogmatic and unwarranted predictions. Withthis charge in mind, let us look at the concluding passage of an otherwisesober, serious and reputable book on the chemical origins of life on earth. Thewriter, a molecular biologist, having discussed evolution and described it,tendentiously but unemotionally, as a steady increase in intelligence, turns hisattention to the future. Mankind, he says, is likely to throw up a new, distinctand more intelligent type, which will then become ‘reproductively isolated’. Hethen goes on (and I have not cheated by removing any words like ‘possibly’ or‘perhaps’):He [man] will splinter into types of humans with differing mental faculties thatwill lead to diversification and separate species. From among these types, a newspecies, Omega man, will emerge either alone, in union with others, or withmechanical amplification to transcend to new dimensions of time and space beyondour comprehension – as much beyond our imagination as our world was to theemerging eucaryotes… . If evolution is to proceed through the line of man to anext higher form, there must exist within man’s nature the making of Omega man…. Omega man’s comprehension and participation in the dimensions of thesupernatural is what man yearns for himself, but cannot have. It is reasonableto assume that man’s intellect is not the ultimate, but merely represents astage intermediate between the primates and Omega man. What comprehension andpowers over Nature Omega man will command can only be suggested by man’s imageof the supernatural.1 [22_Notes.html#fn-c04_en1]Do any doubts arise? Just one. There may be a problem about timing. Major stepsin evolution have been occurring at steadily decreasing intervals, and the nextone may be due shortly. It must be the one the writer is waiting for. He adds:‘On such a shortened curve, conceivably Omega man could succeed man in fewerthan 10,000 years.’ Ordinary evolution, however, is too slow to allow of thisstartling development. So what is to be done? The reply comes briskly.How then can Omega man arise in so short a time?The answer is unavoidable.Man will make him.This is apparently a reference to genetic engineering, something speciallyimportant to those whose faith leans heavily on the dramatic idea of infallible,escalator-type evolution. They demand from that idea, not just an inspiringaccount of the past, but also hope for continued progress in the future. But thehuman race cannot be confidently expected to evolve further in a literal,biological sense. Human social arrangements, even in simple cultures, blocknormal natural selection. And the more elaborate they get, the more they do so.Nineteenth-century Social Darwinists attacked this problem with a meat-axe,calling for deliberate eugenic selection and harsh commercial competition, sothat the race could go back to being properly weeded and could continue toprogress. As we now know, however, these schemes were not just odious butfutile. The scale was wrong. Commercial competition has no tendency to affectreproduction. And as for ‘positive eugenics’, it is not possible to identifydesirable genes nor to force people to breed for them. Even if it were, theirspread would still be absurdly slow.The natural conclusion is that such schemes should be dropped, that the humanrace must take itself as it is, with its well-known vast powers of culturaladaptation, and make the best of its existing capacities. But this thought isunbearable to those whose faith in life is pinned to the steady, continuing,upward escalator of biological evolution. ‘If evolution is to proceed throughthe line of man to a next higher form’, as Day puts it, there simply has to beanother way. That wish, rather than the amazingly thin argument he producesabout recurrent evolutionary steps, is evidently the ground of his confidence.This confidence itself is of course not new. In the 1930s, the geneticist H. J.Muller made a very similar prediction:And so we foresee the history of life divided into three main phases. In thelong preparatory phase it was the helpless creature of its environment, andnatural selection gradually ground it into a human shape. In the second – ourown short transitional phase – it reaches out at the immediate environment,shaking, shaping and grinding to suit the form, the requirements, the wishes,and the whims of man. And in the long third phase, it will reach down into thesecret places of its own nature, and by aid of its ever-growing intelligence andco-operation, shape itself into an increasingly sublime creation – a beingbeside which the mythical divinities of the past will seem more and moreridiculous, and which setting its own marvellous inner powers against the bruteGoliath of the suns and planets, challenges them to contest.2[22_Notes.html#fn-c04_en2]The Illicit EscalatorThis pattern, it should be noticed, is quite incompatible with regular Darwinianscientific theory. The idea of a vast escalator, proceeding steadily upwardsfrom lifeless matter through plants and animals to man, and inevitably on tohigher things, was coined by Lamarck and given currency by Herbert Spencer underhis chosen name, ‘evolution’.Darwin utterly distrusted the idea, which seemed to him a baseless piece oftheorizing, and avoided the name. As far as he could see, he said, ‘no innatetendency to progressive development exists… . It is curious how seldom writersdefine what they mean by progressive development.’3 [22_Notes.html#fn-c04_en3]His theory of natural selection gives no ground for it and does not require it.As has been pointed out,4 [22_Notes.html#fn-c04_en4] it arranges species in aradiating bush rather than on a ladder, accounting for all kinds of development,and also for some cases of unchangingness and of ‘regression’, equally aslimited responses to particular environments. The notion of a ladder is ofcourse derived from the older one of the stationary stair, the scala naturae,which combined some sensible ideas about increasing complexity with some farless sensible ones about hierarchy and government. No ladders are needed forclassification. Linear development, or orthogenesis, is an idle fifth wheel tothe coach.Darwin saw no reason to posit any law guaranteeing the continuation of any ofthe changes he noted, or to pick out any one of them, such as increase inintelligence, as the core of the whole proceeding. Spencer, by contrast,instantly saw a complicated law of increasing heterogeneity: to him, ‘briefinspection made it manifest that the law held in the inorganic world, as in theorganic and the superorganic’.5 [22_Notes.html#fn-c04_en5] Accordingly, as oneof his followers pointed out with pride, ‘the Theory of Evolution dealing withthe universe as a whole, from gas to genius, was formulated some months beforethe publication of the Darwin–Wallace paper’ (a priority claim which Darwinnever wanted to dispute).6 [22_Notes.html#fn-c04_en6]From that time to this, Spencer’s bold, colourful and flattering picture ofevolution has constantly prevailed over the more sober, difficult one of Darwin,not only in the public mind, but also surprisingly often in the minds ofscientists who had reason to know its limitations. That distinguished physicistJ. D. Bernal shaped it in a way which bears some relation to Day’s in aremarkable Marxist Utopia published in 1929. Pointing out that things might geta trifle dull and unchallenging in the future, when the state had withered awayafter the triumph of the proletariat, Bernal predicted that only the dimmerminds would be content with this placid paradise. Accordingly, ‘the aristocracyof scientific intelligence’ would give rise to new developments and create aworld run increasingly by scientific experts. Scientific institutions wouldgradually become the government and thus achieve ‘a further stage of the Marxianhierarchy of domination’. The end result would be that scientists ‘would emergeas a new species and leave humanity behind’.7 [22_Notes.html#fn-c04_en7]"},{"pageContent":" 5 Choosing a WorldWhat is not possible is not to choose.J.-P. SartreDiverging Human IdealsThis scheme gives a clue to the meaning of Day’s otherwise startling andmysterious prediction that the new superhumans would be ‘reproductivelyisolated’. What made this idea seem conceivable was surely the already existingthought that scientists ought to form a caste apart, running the world withoutany possibility of interference by politicians, historians, voters or members ofany other alien or intrusive group.This idea was strongly promoted by H.G. Wells, and was altogether rather popularin the inter-war years. It is still often found in science fiction, andpermeates much other literature. Since a training in physical science does notof itself qualify people as administrators, the word ‘science’ tends to get arather odd meaning here. It often seems to centre on membership of the club ortribe of scientists, and on rejection of other competing clubs or tribes, ratherthan on theories or even ways of enquiry.This usage is delightfully shown in B. F. Skinner’s Utopia, Walden Two, which herepeatedly and devoutly claims is scientific. But the only sense in which thisbizarre place could possibly be called scientific is that its founders think ofthemselves as scientists, that is, members of the laboratory-based tribe, unitedagainst e.g. historians. Their curious schemes are not based on discoveries orarguments drawn from any science, but on simple wish-fulfilment about ways ofordering life which would suit scientists. For instance, babies in Walden Twoare brought up in almost total isolation and monotony in air-conditioned cellsup to the age of a year, and still spend much of their time there until they arethree. That treatment is so successful that thereafter they are perfectlyadjusted members of society and their emotional development gives no furthertrouble. This, Skinner explains, is not just a good way of producing sane,balanced adults, but the only way. The founder of Walden Two can therefore fullyexcuse his own rather obvious emotional deficiencies by the agonized cry, ‘Can’tyou see? I’m not a product of Walden Two!’1 [22_Notes.html#fn-c05_en1]It should be noticed that this story is directly contrary to a central tenet ofSkinner’s actual scientific beliefs – namely that since man has no instincts,behaviour can only be produced by other behaviour. Conditioning is essential. Ifthat tenet is right, the children should come out of their cells even morestunted and helpless than the rest of us would expect – indeed, almost exactlyas they went in. That they can come out in an admirable state of development isa miracle, explicable only by a far stronger theory of innate tendencies thanthose against which Skinner constantly fought. It is not a scientific dream. Itis merely the dream of a shy, unsocial scientist.Skinner, however, at least did not propose that his enlightened scientistsshould form a hereditary caste, reproductively isolated from the proles. Afterthe Second World War, a certain embarrassment began to surround this kind ofproposal, and for some time it was no longer openly supported. Instead, theemphasis was usually laid on simply increasing intelligence. But it seems clearthat this is at least often seen as equivalent to the proposal to produce moreand better scientists.This interpretation seems the only possible explanation of the strange lack ofinterest in the problem of conflicting ideals. What sort of intelligence are weto aim for? Indeed, more basically still, why is intelligence as such to takeprecedence over all other human ideals? Such problems are bypassed entirely.Thus, the Nobel prize-winning molecular biologist J. Lederberg writes in TowardsCentury 21, ‘Now what stops us making supermen? The main thing that stops us isthat we don’t know the biochemistry of the object that we are trying toproduce.’2 [22_Notes.html#fn-c05_en2] It does not seem to strike him, any morethan Day, that we cannot identify or conceive that supposed object at all,because of the relation in which we stand to it.There is an immense range of human ideals. But a product which is to bemanufactured must be specified exactly. Will Nietzsche’s super-men do as a modelfor the Omega factory? or perhaps Bernard Shaw’s Ancients? Do we wantSupereinstein, Supernietzsche, Superbeethoven, Superconfucius, Superdarwin,Superbuddha, Supernapoleon, or some sort of highest common factor (designed by acommittee) between these and all other human eminences? How are the superwomento be fitted in? Even if we somehow made an arbitrary choice, the whole idea ofthe lesser designing the greater is surely incoherent. Could a child invent anadult, or a crook invent an honest person? Everybody projects their faults intotheir work, and the more ambitious the work, the more glaring the faults become.We see these limitations plainly when we look back at the past, or outward atother cultures. If each previous century had been given the chance to put itsideals in concrete form, to produce its own supermen, we know just what faultswe should expect to find in the products.Superman buffs today commonly hope to escape this kind of partiality byassuming: (1) that what is needed is simply more of a single, timelessabstraction, intelligence, measured by intelligence tests; and (2) that thatabstraction is a genetically distinct characteristic, controlled by its own geneor genes. Both these ideas, however, are indefensible. Intelligence in thissense – cleverness – is certainly useful, but how it is used depends on the aimsof those using it. Like other powers, it is just an added danger in bad hands.And clever people, simply as such, unfortunately do not show the slightesttendency to be either less wicked or less weak than stupid ones.What we normally mean by ‘intelligence’ is not just cleverness. It includes suchthings as imagination, sensibility, good sense and sane aims: things far toocomplex to appear in tests or to be genetically isolated. And even whatintelligence testers mean by intelligence is itself just a convenient compromise– entity specially evolved for use in the social sciences – handy undoubtedlyfor many purposes, but not related to the biological complexity of nerves andbrain, and a non-starter as a possible distinct, genetically heritablecharacteristic. In The Mismeasure of Man3 [22_Notes.html#fn-c05_en3] that veryhumane and shrewd palaeontologist Stephen Jay Gould has told with carefulfairness the dismal story of the long attempts to treat it as such, and has madeclear that their failure was not accidental, nor even due to distortion bysinister political motives. The scheme itself is incoherent, and without thosepolitical motives it would never have been entertained. Certainly we need ournerves and brain to think with. But the power of thought to which theycontribute is not something which can be sliced offand packaged separately. Itis not an ingredient to be measured out into the stew, but an aspect of thewhole personality.Utopia TroubleDoes this dismissal sound unduly dogmatic and high-handed? It is, of course,extremely hard today to look clearly at questions about the possibility of suchprojects. On the one hand, because science has increased technical possibilitiesstaggeringly in the last two centuries, eminent persons have again and againmade asses of themselves by denying the possibility of things which weresubsequently done. But, on the other hand, science itself commits us to a beliefin natural laws which are independent of human will and which have not beenpassed for our benefit. It gives us no sort of guarantee that the world is somade as to ensure that everything we want can be done. Indeed, in such littlematters as mortality and the eventual extinction of the species, it hints prettybroadly that there are things we cannot have. The need to recognize the absenceof this guarantee, and to come to terms with a universe which lacks it, is acentral theme of this book. What I am opposing is the distortion of scienceitself to give either the guarantee or an illicit emotional compensation for itsabsence.This is of course a much larger matter than the objections just made to relyingon genetic engineering for human salvation. But people do tend at present tomeet the large point by drawing a series of blank cheques on the future to meetthe small ones. Is my pessimism here just one more fallible prediction about alocal supposed impossibility, like earlier pessimistic predictions about flight?Can the continued development of the sciences be relied on to get us Omega manin the end?Now of course it is true that the more technical set of objections – the onesaimed against supposing it possible to control reliably the change of humancharacter traits by genetic tinkering – do depend on the state of genetics as itis understood today. These engineering proposals would look much more plausibleif one used the ‘beanbag genetics’ of fifty years ago. And as it is true thatnobody knows what the genetics of the future will be like, there could be areversal. In the same way, when we say that time travel is impossible, or thatthere will never be perpetual motion machines or matter duplicators or thetransmutation of other metals into gold, we are speaking in terms of physics aswe know it. Some day our denials might look silly. But in choosing now betweenschemes for further development, we really have no alternative to using theideas at present available to us. That is why the Patent Office will not nowlook at perpetual-motion machines.The other objections I am making to the project – the ones concerned with theincoherence of supposing that we understand our own nature well enough to set itright directly, by choosing certain character changes, without first dealingwith the value conflicts which at present tear the world apart – are independentof this technical issue. Naturally they too use current thinking, which may oneday be altered. But however much one may expect this, it is unfortunately notpossible to conduct an argument by simply sitting back and waiting for the otherperson’s ideas to become obsolete. They have to be answered today, and in moreor less the same terms in which they were stated, unless one can at once improvethese. This kind of objection to the genetic approach does not depend ontechnical developments, for which we might have to wait, but on the whole shapeof the moral and psychological problem to be solved. The libertarian politicalphilosopher Robert Nozick states it well, in his general polemic againstUtopias:Given the enormous complexity of man, his many desires, aspirations, impulses,talents, mistakes, loves, sillinesses, given the thickness of his intertwinedand interrelated levels, facets, relationships (compare the thinness of thesocial scientists’ description of man to that of the novelists), and given thecomplexity of interpersonal institutions and relationships, and the complexityof co-ordination of the actions of many people, it is enormously unlikely that,even if there were one ideal pattern for society, it could be arrived at in thisa priori (relative to current knowledge) fashion. And even supposing that somegreat genius did come along with the blueprint, who could have confidence thatit could work out well?4 [22_Notes.html#fn-c05_en4]He adds the comment of another political philosopher, Alexander Gray, that ‘noUtopia has ever been described in which any sane man would on any conditionsconsent to live, if he could possibly escape’ which is true enough. But unlessthe expected Utopia had first been fully thought out as a whole, the designingof citizens for it could never be started. These people would not be, as mosttechnological products are, tools to be used for a pre-set purpose belonging totheir users and designers. They would need to be the owners of entirely new setsof purposes, and parts of a social whole quite inconceivable to those whodesigned them. They would need to be solvers of enormous problems about the waysin which human beings are to live together – problems which we ourselves havenot solved and do not even know how to state properly. If the genetic enterprisewas to be worth while, they would have to approach these from a quite new angle.But for us to program them, we should need already to know what that angle was,to have cracked the nut ourselves.The scheme, in short, has all the snags of other Utopias, with the additionaldrawback of not showing its working, not making explicit the distinctive ideasand institutions by which it means to solve the age-old problems of human sociallife. Promising us genetic mechanisms will no more fill this gap thanrecommending an electric oven will show us how to cook.Boring LimitationsOn the whole these wider conceptual objections to the possibility of makingparticular changes seem both more serious and more interesting than the moredetailed and technical ones. Nevertheless, I think it will be worth while to paysome attention to these, because it is really interesting to see how strong adetailed mythology has grown up to make the idea of such operations look muchmore plausible than it is.It is clear from a number of popular books, such as What Sort of People ShouldThere Be? by the moral philosopher Jonathan Glover,5 [22_Notes.html#fn-c05_en5]that the DNA is often conceived as something like a film-strip, which can beunrolled and examined. The frame depicting a particular characteristic can thenbe directly spotted and any necessary changes made, so that the resultingpicture now conforms to our wishes, without any interference with the rest ofthe film.No doubt scientists have not meant to convey this wild story, but a number ofcommonly used metaphors tend to produce it, notably the description of genes as‘coding’ for particular characteristics. In this metaphor, the ‘reader’ of thecoding is of course the organism itself, which is thus moved to produce what isneeded. To the uninstructed human reader, however, it sounds as if the scientistcould read the code, as he might read a film-strip.Next, there is a systematic distortion of language in the frequent talk of genesas ‘coding for’ behaviour, as if a given gene produced a given unit ofbehaviour, independent of all experience, as infallibly as it might producebrown eyes. That very shrewd ethologist, Patrick Bateson, in a recent review,tells the significant story of how he took a colleague to task for using thislanguage in an otherwise excellent article on the genetic analysis of behaviour:I said ‘You can’t mean that genes bear any straightforward correspondence tobehaviour’ and I began to give him a lecture on the systems character ofdevelopment. He listened quietly and replied disarmingly, ‘You are right. Thetrouble is I can’t think like that.’6 [22_Notes.html#fn-c05_en6]The incapacity is common, and the temptation to oversimplify such processes isenormous, not least when there are computers to be programmed. In this way,scientists who themselves know better can mislead not only the defencelessgeneral public including their students, but eventually themselves as well.Let us then glance quickly at a few of the practical obstacles to this sort ofscheme. The most plausible cases where such techniques are proposed for humansconcern the elimination of certain inherited conditions producing diseases.These cases (whatever other difficulties they may turn out to involve) share twoexceptional advantages with certain simple physical characteristics like eyecolour. First, they are clearly identifiable; there is no controversy about whois a haemophiliac. It is therefore possible to learn something about theirgenetic pattern directly from family history. Second, they are, so far as isknown, governed by a single gene.This situation is exceptional. Many qualities are present more or less, and areaffected both in their degree and their kind by a great number of factors duringthe individual’s life as well as in his genetic make-up. They cannot be firmlyidentified, and with humans, where culture is such a powerful factor, familyhistory would tell us next to nothing about their genetic basis. Moreover, evenwhere that basis is at work, each is not normally tied to a single gene.Most properties are affected by many genes; most genes affect many properties.7[22_Notes.html#fn-c05_en7] Also, owing to polymorphism, properties which aresimilar in living individuals may be produced by different combinations ofgenes. The effect of a given gene can vary greatly, too, according to theinfluence of other genes which are combined with it. Moreover, genes tend to becorrelated in blocks in a way which usually makes it hard to identify theinfluence of each of them. Thus, even properties which might seem no morecomplex than eye colour are normally impossible to change without a large,unpredictable series of other changes. But the qualities we might want toproduce (putting aside for the moment the crushing difficulty of deciding whichof them to favour) could not possibly be ones as simple as eye colour.Intelligence for instance – which may seem to be one of the simplest of them –is known to have a very complex physiological basis, with the two brainhemispheres contributing in extremely subtle ways and undoubtedly other parts ofthe nervous and glandular system playing unknown parts. It is not, therefore,just a matter of finding which genes control some one quality, and checking whatother effects those genes have, but of finding a whole range of interlinkedqualities, each controlled by its own indefinite complexity of genes.The Experimentation ProblemIf anyone still feels like treating all this as simply a long task, to be dealtwith by persistent experimentation, it is time to ask just how thatexperimentation would be carried out. Will it be by consent, and if so, whoseconsent? And how long is it supposed to take?If some extraterrestrial being were to become interested in the inheritedelement in human behavioural tendencies, and wanted to experiment on its geneticbasis, the first precaution he would need to take would be to have a life-spanabout as much longer than ours as ours is longer than that of bacteria, or atleast of fruit-flies. Otherwise he would not live to see the result of his workand – supposing science on his native planet to go on much as it does here –ideas would have changed so much before anybody did see it that it would nolonger be of much interest.The second precaution of course would be the one which is also taken withbacteria: not to ask his subjects what they wanted, but to decide flatly oncertain changes, chosen simply for their genetic convenience, and to pursue themregardless of anyone’s views except his own. He would have to start with a longexploratory programme of controlled breeding, simply to find out how desirabletraits were linked to genes in the first place. Supposing that this dideventually begin to show some hopeful pointers, there would then have to be anequally long phase of trial-and-error breeding to check his hypothesis. On whatterms is it expected that human parents would consent to let themselves andtheir children be subjects for this prolonged and quite unpredictable process,from which they could expect nothing but harm?It is rather extraordinary how advocates of genetic engineering overlook thisproblem. Thus Jonathan Glover, in a discussion notable for its carefully calmtone, says this:Any program of genetic engineering to modify our intellectual functions wouldobviously have to be very cautious and experimental. But once it showed signs ofworking without bad side-effects, it seems likely that some parents would chooseto have children who would transcend our traditional limitations.8[22_Notes.html#fn-c05_en8]So who were the experimental subjects up till then? Glover, who is not actuallyone to propose using the proles, is probably thinking that they can be animals.The corrupting effect of habitually treating animals as expendable confusespeople’s thought here, but this is no solution. Human genes are what is inquestion, and no work would be the slightest use that was not done on a humansubject. The familiar difficulty about medical experimentation comes in, but inan extreme form.What the experimental subjects would get would not be a risky but promisingprospect of cure, to which they might consent if they were ill enough, orbenevolent enough towards future sufferers to want to contribute to knowledge oftheir illness. Instead, it would be a gratuitously twisted constitution, anunguided tampering with the only set of capacities which they have for theirlife-time. Of course there is an off-chance that it might work out well. But atthe outset there is absolutely no reason to expect this. Just as most mutationsare harmful, it is to be expected that most interferences with a very complexgenetic program would be so at first, since they would be nearly as blind asmutations. As for consent, the person most concerned could not possibly give it.The parents could, but why on earth should they be willing to?So desperate is this dilemma that it might not seem possible to make it worse,but Glover does so. Replying to the objection that relevant human qualities,such as aggression, may not be under much genetic control anyway, he says thatthis is irrelevant, since:all this would show is that, within our species, the distribution of genesrelevant to aggression is very uniform. It would show nothing about the likelyeffects on aggression if we use genetic engineering to give people a differentset of genes from those that they now have.9 [22_Notes.html#fn-c05_en9]What does this extraordinary phrase mean? It presumably cannot mean an entirenew set, like false teeth. It most plausibly means either the introduction ofsome anti-aggressive genes never found in humans before (from where? how made?)or the thorough rearrangement of existing genes in such a way as to suppressthose currently held to produce aggression. (It is taken for granted that lessaggression is what is needed.) Both these proposals are so drastic as toincrease the experimentation problem enormously. No one could have the leastidea how the attempts might turn out.There is another snag, however, which is cognitive rather than moral, but noless disastrous. It would be necessary to establish how successful the changesbeing attempted were. How could this be done? The job of controlling aggressionis done, as things are, by many cultural means. These are constantly changing,and affect each individual differently. Suppose an improvement took place, howis the environment to be discounted? Even if the experimental seedlings showedan average differential improvement, how could one be sure that this was not dueto their experimental status and the special wish for improvement inspiringtheir parents? Control conditions are in principle impossible.Because culture is known to have such power, it is not really possible forGlover to take the line he does of simply not being interested in enquiries todiscover how far the qualities in question are genetically controlled at all. Hedismisses these by rejecting claims to exactness, such as that aggression is 95per cent environmental. This is undoubtedly right; such figures are far tooambitious. But that does not get rid of the question of how much difference onecould possibly expect to make by genetic means, and therefore how much effort itis worth directing to these attempts in proportion to other ways of sorting outhuman life.About aggression, too, another interesting problem arises. There already arequite a lot of people about who are markedly less aggressive than those aroundthem. What happens is that they tend to get pushed around and to have lessinfluence than they should on human life. It is not impossible for them to maketheir way by other means, but it is hard, especially in societies like ourswhich are rampantly competitive. To add other individuals, specially made, tothis engaging band would not on the face of it have any general effect, sincethey would be put upon just like the existing members. Certainly it ought to bepossible, in principle, for other qualities to be used to compensate for theabsence of the cruder forms of aggression, both in individuals and in societies.But to expect to achieve this subtle aim directly by gross interference with anemotional constitution of which we have only the vaguest understanding seemswild.Glover, who shows a good deal of sensibility to problems of this sort when hehappens to notice them, remarks on some possible dangers flowing from ourignorance:A generation of parents might opt heavily for their children having physical orintellectual abilities and skills. We might leave out a sense of humour. Or wemight not notice how important to us is some other quality such as emotionalwarmth.… Without really wanting to do so, we might stumble into producing peoplewith a deep coldness. This possibility seems one of the worst imaginable.10[22_Notes.html#fn-c05_en10]But this, and other disasters like it, are exactly the sort of outcome to bemost expected from interference with this complex system. Nobody has theremotest idea what a sense of humour is, let alone what might be its geneticbasis, or how to code for emotional warmth. Autistic children are, it seems,often highly intelligent; it is thoroughly obscure what is wrong with them, butit may well be genetic. There is almost certainly a whole range of possibledisasters comparable to autism, which may be produced by the failure ofcombinations of genes which we now take for granted. In trying to produceincreased scientific or musical powers – projects which Glover likes – we wouldindeed drive straight into the range of these conditions.Is it fair to pile up this mass of rather down-to-earth objections against theOmega project, when it is so obviously meant as a sublime, far-reaching,straight-up-to-heaven one? Certainly this kind of response sometimes shows merefailure of imagination. Sublime proposals, simply as such, are entitled to somerespect when so many of us do not raise our noses from our troughs at all. Allthe same, we do need somehow to distinguish between false and true sublimity.The trouble with the Omega project is that it is resolute about its physicalmeans but much vaguer about its ends, and that when it becomes specific theretoo, it is (as we shall see) commonly much less convincing. And sublimitybelongs to ends, not means.But since it is the means on which we are asked to concentrate, doubts abouttheir practicality do seem in order. When Omega-creation, or even any notableimprovement in human nature, is put forward as a practical scheme and not justas an edifying story, it has two alarming features.The first, already stressed, is that its ideal aspect is so thinly developed. Itsimply slots recent biochemical discoveries directly on to existing Utopianfantasies without indicating any particular solution to the endless moral,political and practical problems which infest the ground between. Itmanufactures ideal people before even glancing at the thicket of confusionsbetween inadequately related ideals which have so far seemed to make itimpossible even to see how to conceive of them. It shows that rather dubiousNietzschean virtue: ‘love of the remotest’ – a penchant for long voyages assuch, without any particular interest in their direction – and a contempt forexisting people, excused by a somewhat theoretical attachment to people who arenot here yet: ‘Higher than love of one’s neighbour is love for the remote andfor the future. And I hold love for things and phantoms higher than love formen.’11 [22_Notes.html#fn-c05_en11] There is a point in this sort of thing as acorrective, but it scarcely makes sense on its own. We will look further intothis trouble in the next chapter.The other matter, though smaller in a way, is also significant. The fact that soostentatiously forward-looking a proposal makes use of out-of-date geneticscannot really be sneezed away. True though it may be that these theories mightcome back into fashion, just as perpetual-motion physics or the transmutation ofmetals might, the thing needs explanation. The central point, which we willconsider more fully later, is that early in this century genes were consideredas operating separately and independently, but they are now known to form a mostcomplex system of interdependent parts. Even the word ‘gene’ is not the name ofa single bead on a string; it is used to cover at least three different lengthsof the continuous DNA molecule.Unluckily, however, the symbolism attending the earlier picture was potent, andhas kept it active as an underlying image which works, like the Lamarckianescalator, to distort people’s thinking. About the proposals we are nowconsidering, it has the obvious attraction of making schemes go on lookingpossible which on current ideas cannot possibly be so. It extends the euphoriawhich may have been excusable in Muller to support further fantasy in an agewhich can by no means afford it. But it has also a deeper, more purelyimaginative attraction. Simply as an image, this idea of independent,disconnected genes supplies a seductive picture of a totally individualisticsociety. The atomistic notion of freedom as total detachment is figured in italluringly, and power fantasies linked to this dream of irresponsibility areeagerly celebrated. Its most obvious incarnation is Richard Dawkins’s book TheSelfish Gene,12 [22_Notes.html#fn-c05_en12] but we shall find it flourishing inmany other places. At present all that is needed is to mention it, in order topoint out that questions about the genetics of Omega-creation are not a merepettifogging irrelevance."},{"pageContent":" 6 The Problem of DirectionThen said Evangelist, ‘If this be thy condition, wherefore standest thou still?’He answered, ‘Because I know not whither to go.’John BunyanThe Claim to MomentousnessTo light up the difficulties further, it will be worth while taking a furtherlook at Jonathan Glover’s tantalizingly titled book, What Sort of People ShouldThere Be?1 [22_Notes.html#fn-c06_en1]Glover’s discussion is interesting because his tone and official intention areso different from the naïve, evangelistic Utopianism we have just been seeing.But at root I think he is just as machine-struck, just as carried away on a waveof undiagnosed faith in technology as such.On the surface he is highly moderate and reasonable. He quotes Muller’sprophecies with suitable contempt, commenting that ‘the case for geneticengineering is not helped by adopting the tones of a mad scientist in a horrorfilm’. His declared aim is not to transform the human race according to ablueprint but to increase its freedom by allowing it certain valuable kinds ofdevelopment which would otherwise be closed to it. He notes the difficulty ofdeciding who is to be in charge, warns us of the twin dangers of totalitarian,state-organized transformation and of anarchic, unbalanced changes produced byfree enterprise in the ‘genetic supermarket’ so amazingly proposed by RobertNozick.He does not, however, seem to notice the idiocy of this proposal. Nozick, whilerejecting a genetically engineered Utopia on the grounds mentioned earlier,advises such a market ‘meeting the individual specifications (within certainmoral limits) of prospective parents’2 [22_Notes.html#fn-c06_en2] as a means tosecuring a wide and varied spread of future types, and also as an expression ofthe parents’ freedom. There being no point on which parents are so reliablyconventional as their hopes for their children, what this would presumably bringabout would be a society solidly manufactured for the demands of the previousage, and a gene pool needing to be altered radically in each generation by a setof people incapable of taking any other direction. All this supposing: (1) thatit could work; (2) that the poisoning of parent–child relations which wouldfollow on such open manipulation did not destroy family life altogether; and (3)that the choices offered were not in any case totally determined within a verynarrow range by the scientists running the market.Glover, however, accepts the scheme at Nozick’s valuation and notes no dangerbut anarchy. All along, he gives the impression that the changes he expects froma moderate form of this scheme would be merely of the same order as thoseproduced by new information technology or forms of transport. Yet, immediatelyafter the passage just quoted, he writes:But behind the rhetoric is a serious point. If we decide on a positive programto change our nature, this will be a central moment in our history, and thetransformation might be beneficial to a degree we can scarcely now imagine.3[22_Notes.html#fn-c06_en3]And his main message certainly is that though we must act cautiously, we must onno account let this unique opportunity slip.Why should this particular technology be expected to make a change which wouldcount as a central moment in the history of the human race?In answer, something must I think be said bluntly and generally for a startabout the misleading effect of propaganda claims made on behalf of any line inlearning or technology which has recently had some striking successes. Claimantshere do not have to be dishonest, or more than usually obsessed by the need forresearch money, to be led on to exaggerate. There is a dazzlement, anunavoidable confusion of vision, which makes realistic foresight temporarilyimpossible. Molecular biology or biochemistry (if we may use the more convenientname) has been in this situation since the discovery of DNA. The world hasseemed to be its oyster. It is neither accident nor some sinister prejudice onmy part which accounts for the high proportion of quotations from biochemists inthis book.Resounding discoveries have combined with a sense of a commanding position onthe frontiers of the physical and biological sciences to generate among thesescientists a euphoric sense of cognitive omnipotence, of possessing methodswhich have been finally tested as correct and will be universally applicable. Tomany of them, their position appears to be that of missionaries from thephysical sciences, spreading physical methods once for all over the hithertorecalcitrant realms of the life sciences, and thus over all remainingintellectual areas of the slightest interest. The great physicist David Bohmcomments:Molecular biologists have discovered that in the growth and reproduction ofcells, certain laws that can be given a mechanical form of description aresatisfied (especially those having to do with DNA, RNA, the synthesis ofproteins). From this, most of them have gone on to the conclusion thatultimately all aspects and sides of life will be explained in mechanical terms.But on what basis can this be said? … It should be recalled that at the end ofthe nineteenth century, physicists widely believed that classical physics gavethe general outlines of a complete mechanical explanation of the universe. Sincethen, relativity and quantum mechanics have overturned such notions altogether …Classical physics was swept aside and overturned… Is it not likely that modernmolecular biology will sooner or later undergo a similar fate?…The notion that present lines of thinking will continue to be validatedindefinitely by experiment is just another article of faith, similar to that ofthe nineteenth-century physicists… Is there not a kind of ‘hubris’ that seemsrather often to penetrate the very fabric of scientific thought, and to capturethe minds of scientists, whenever any particular scientific theory has beensuccessful for some period of time? This takes the form of a fervently heldbelief that what has been discovered will continue to work indefinitely,ultimately to cover the whole of reality.4 [22_Notes.html#fn-c06_en4]Physicists, in fact, have abandoned the simple-minded mechanistic thinking whichis the basis of biochemical superconfidence, and biochemists are liable to findthemselves in the position of missionaries returning to Rome to find that a newpope has reversed the doctrines they were preaching. And though it is in a sensean accident that this has happened so soon, that superconfidence could not haveendured long in any case. It is in the nature of science that such boldprojections into the future always have to be modified.Placing the NeedSo much, then, for the mere degree of euphoric confidence which is radiated, thegeneral certainty of being able to make useful changes. Besides this, if we areto speak of a central moment in human history, we would need another component,the sense of a special need, correctly located, which that technology and noother can satisfy.Much more is needed here than the mere general belief, on which most of us wouldprobably agree, that there is a terrible lot wrong with human nature. (Those whodo not believe that there is such a thing as human nature at all will not beinterested in genetic engineering to alter it in any case.) Any diagnosis whichwould show this technology to be relevant would have to fix what is wrongconvincingly in a quality, or set of qualities, with a distinct genetic basiswhich could be changed, and say what changes were called for. Without thatdiagnosis, there is nothing momentous.I find it remarkable that Glover’s book does not deal at all in arguments aboutthe nature of this need. Many of the changes he discusses are seen as relativelyminor additions to the amenities and achievements of life: the production ofmusical prodigies, cleverer physicists or especially ‘imaginative and creative’people. Others deal with alterations which seem equally slight (at least inGlover’s view) but are distinguished by needing some sort of science-fictiondevice to bring them about, for instance the power to see directly into eachother’s thoughts at all times, or to switch off an unwelcome desire by somemechanical device. Here the writer is chiefly occupied with persuading us not tobe too prejudiced against these (as he thinks) promising devices. But thisoverlooks the more obvious question: why these particular changes should bepicked on. He claims that the first would make us more considerate and thesecond more autonomous. Neither story convinces me, but even if they did, it ishardly plausible that they would make all the difference needed for thesalvation of the human race.In general, the guiding aim which Glover sets up is increased variety to enrichhuman freedom, rather in the spirit of Nozick and of John Stuart Mill’s Essay onLiberty. Mill said:As it is useful that while mankind is imperfect there should be differentopinions, so it is that there should be different experiments of living; thatfree scope should be given to varieties of character, short of injury to others…Human nature is not a machine to be built after a model, and set to do exactlythe work prescribed for it, but a tree, which requires to grow and developitself on all sides.5 [22_Notes.html#fn-c06_en5]Why, however, do we need genetic engineering to supply this many-sidedness, whenwe already have (as Mill pointed out) a bewilderingly wide range of optionsgenetically provided, most of which we have never even glanced at owing to thenarrowness and repressiveness of our cultures? In order to have reason to callin the engineers here, we would need reason to believe that human nature hadfailed us. Mill’s whole book on Liberty is a celebration of human nature, adeclaration of faith that it will not fail us. Glover’s is the exact opposite,and the difference is crucial.To make Glover’s remedies relevant, we would have to be convinced by goodevidence that what holds back human achievement at present is lack of naturalvariety, that is, lack of talent. This seems a strange view, which would need agreat deal of support. On the face of things, enormous potential for variety isalready present, as is shown by the differences between people in differentcultures, and the main thing that blocks our achievements is not lack of talent,which is running to waste all round us, but bad social arrangements and neuroticconfusion in individuals. To commission more varied talents in that situationseems like pouring more good materials into a factory already choked byconfusion and maladministration.Even if it might be nice to have more musical prodigies, then, this sort ofthing does not seem enough to constitute a central moment in human history. Nordoes it at all answer the intriguing question of Glover’s title, ‘what sort ofpeople should there be?’ On this point he simply accepts existing notions. Thequestions about conflicting values which would seem primary if we are reallydiscussing future directions for our society do not get raised at all.The Argument from UntriednessThe obvious remaining issue, then, is the one which would perhaps be bettertitled ‘what sort of people should there not be any longer, if we can possiblyhelp it?’ We turn away from the ambitious, optimistic perspective which sees thehuman race as an adequate going concern and boldly undertakes to make it farbetter, so much better that this will be a ‘central moment’ in its history. Wedrop the huge task which that perspective imposed of grappling with the mistakesof Plato, Thomas More, Jonathan Swift, Aldous Huxley and all the others who havetried to indicate right and wrong directions for humanity. We no longerundertake to supply a blueprint so much better than theirs that work onproducing citizens suited to the new ideal can be put in hand at once. By asudden Gestalt shift, we now stand face to face with the dangers which actuallyconfront our species today. The question becomes much simpler. We are nowlooking for a ‘central moment’ in the sense of a turning-point which will removethe dangers and ensure survival.The task is now not constructive but remedial. Day’s argument from faith inpredestined future glory gives place to something apparently more realistic; anargument from despair. If, says Glover, things are so bad that every knownremedy is by now discredited, then it follows that an unknown one must be tried:‘Given our relative failure so far, we should at least consider the view thatthe abolition of war may need psychological changes which will not simply followfrom political and social reform.’6 [22_Notes.html#fn-c06_en6]Which unknown remedy, however, does this argument favour? An indefinite numberof willing physicians are equally entitled to use it for their ownprescriptions. As it happens, B. F. Skinner made this idea a central plank ofhis platform in his book Beyond Freedom and Dignity. Dismissing all previoussystems of thought as failures, Skinner observed:These have been around for centuries, and all we have to show for them is thestate of the world to-day… What we need is a technology of behaviour. We couldsolve our problems quickly enough if we could adjust the growth of the world’spopulation as precisely as we adjust the course of a spaceship… The fact thatequally powerful instruments and methods are not available in the field of humanbehaviour is not an explanation; it is only part of the puzzle.7[22_Notes.html#fn-c06_en7]The trouble, says Skinner, lies in our failure to assimilate our view of humanbehaviour fully and completely to the model of the physical sciences: ‘Almosteveryone attributes behaviour to intentions, purposes, aims and goals… There isnothing like [this] in modern physics or most of biology, and that fact may wellexplain why a science and technology of behaviour has been so long delayed.’8[22_Notes.html#fn-c06_en8]Skinner’s remedy of course was not genetic engineering. He did not believe inany genetic causes of behaviour: he relied on behaviour modification throughorganized conditioning. His own argument could by now be turned against him;there is already enough experience at hand to show that behaviour modificationis not the panacea we need. And he could reply, as people usually do, that ithas never been properly tried. But this is just as true of the earlier ideaswhich he dismissed as discredited. The recommendation from untriedness is avacuous one. It does not favour any new suggestion more than any other.Suggestions still have to compete on their own merits, and we have seen that thespecial claims of genetic engineering, on this basis, are not impressive.But also the accusation of ‘having failed’ is a stupid way of dismissing ideas.They are complex resources which nearly always have more in them than theirprevious owners have got out. Even the most drastic turning-points in thoughtalways start from some existing notions and owe a great deal to them. Geneticengineering could not possibly be the totally new start which it is being hailedas, because the aims of the engineers would have to be exactly those they drewfrom the life and culture around them. And on the crucial question of whatpsychological changes are needed, they remain entirely vague and unoriginal.Apart from an increase in intelligence – which I have already suggested isirrelevant to our crisis because it deals with means and not with aims – theonly ideas which get suggested are a decrease in aggression and an increase inaltruism.Aggression and AltruismThe snag with both these is not only that, as just noticed, they seem bound toinvolve a loss of assertiveness and therefore of effective power for change.(The situation where a few remaining Stalins manipulate the docile hordes is anatural sequel.) But, more deeply, these simply are not distinct qualities whichcould be raised or lowered in isolation. The task is not at all like justputting less pepper in the stew.As for aggression (considered as a motive, not as the name of an offence), Iwould myself agree that it does have a genetic basis; there is even goodevidence of a centre in the brain specifically concerned with it.9[22_Notes.html#fn-c06_en9] But, as with other such specialized brain centres,this in no way means that nothing else affects it, or that it somehow worksalone. Such a ‘basis’ is not like the foundation of a free-standing pillar, butan organic part of a most complex system, the rest of our emotionalconstitution. Our capacity for anger and attack is deeply interwoven with ourcapacity for fear, for love, for respect and contempt, for grief, parent–childbonding, the attachment to home and an indefinite number of other emotionalelements. To alter one of these would in all reasonable probability be to alterall. And in even trying to find what alteration we needed, we would confront theimpossible task of separating aggression as it is conceived in our culture fromthe abstract possibility which underlies it as a human universal.As for altruism, that is so general a term that it is hard to see what couldpossibly count as a single inherited trait underlying it. The most likely aim,if we are thinking of large-scale political matters like war, is to overcome thelimitation of sympathies which usually restricts people’s concern to thoseimmediately around them. This is indeed the nub of the political problem. Thedifficulty in attempting to cure it has always been that it is relatively easyto curtail the limited sympathies which already exist – to make people ashamedof their undue attachment to those around them – but this does not necessarilyhave the effect of producing enlightened attention to those further off. Charitybegins at home and tends to stay there.No adequate remedy for this has yet been found; we are still struggling withthis barrier, knowing very well that the struggle is now for our life. But it isnot the slightest use suggesting genetic engineering as a short cut. To be so,it would have had to identify just what it is that limits our sympathies and toshow a way round it. Some might be tempted to suggest cloning admirablycharitable people in the hope of getting a new race without narrowed sympathies.But this is to forget the effect of individual life and choice in the shaping ofvirtues. It is evident that upbringing does make an enormous difference here,though this knowledge does not help us as much as it should because we have avery uncertain grasp of the problems of upbringing. Still, this is somethingwhere we do have some hazy idea what we are about. Engineering for supercharitywould not be like that; it is a realm of pure fantasy.All these suggestions have the same attraction: simplicity. They look like waysto break the logjam with a single surgical intervention. But if there is onething we know from the long and hard experience of the human race, it is thatwhat is wrong is not simple. No doubt the trouble does stem from our emotionalconstitution. But the literatures and histories of the world are there totestify to how complex that is, and how hard to understand. It is not possiblethat ‘science’ in any form should now leap in with a solution, because theproblems involved are ones which it has long carefully and explicitly excludedfrom its province.Even psychology, in its modern avatar as a science, has almost entirely turnedits back on problems of motivation. It has tried to reduce them to behaviouralregularities, and often been most unwilling even to think about theirphysiological basis. These problems have been left to psychoanalytic thinking,which itself was long excluded from the academic fold. Psychoanalysis has itsown problems, including those arising from being often used as a secular faith.But it has made a very serious and persistent attempt to understand motivationwithout pretending that it is something else. And in none of its researches hasit ever come across reason to conclude that the whole thing was really perfectlysimple – requiring only the amputation or amplification of some simple emotionalorgan to straighten everything up. The position is not one where all that isneeded is a scientific discovery which would make it possible to do that, evenif such a discovery were a great deal more likely than my argument (based oncurrent genetics) supposes. The difficulty we face is of an entirely differentorder. It involves the kind of understanding of human conduct which has beenexplicitly and carefully excluded from the whole concept of science as we knowit today."},{"pageContent":" 7 Scientist and SuperscientistIt is certain that men contract a general liking for those things which theyhave studied at great cost of time and intellect, and their proficiency in whichhas led to their becoming distinguished and successful… That is why a criminaljudge is an excellent witness against capital punishment, but a bad witness inits favour.Charles Dickens, Three Letters on Capital Punishment, 1846The Wider Interests of ScienceIt cannot, then, be true that science itself demands that scientists shouldtreat all problems as scientific problems. If the narrow definition of sciencecurrently used is to be kept, a great many problems of real scientificimportance fall outside science. The construction of paradigms, and theirrelation to the rest of current thought, becomes a subject on its own. And whenthe pretension to Victorian sagehood was abandoned, all claim to resolve themore general problems of mankind officially went out of the window.Undoubtedly, however, this narrow definition is an unduly confining one. Thereis a much more natural, unofficial usage according to which science is simplywhat scientists do as part of their professional business. Since a great many ofthem are ‘applied’ – are agriculturalists, ecologists, government geologists orclimatologists and so forth – this leads them quite naturally to count thesocial and political arrangements which concern them as part of their business,and to take the responsible attitude of people concerned with the effects oftheir purely theoretical work. And this kind of thing can happen at any timeeven with work which on the face of it is scientifically ‘pure’, as it did withatomic physics and the bomb.It would, I believe, be helpful if rather more attention were given to thepositive advantages of making explicit one’s wider ‘scientific attitude’ and toits unavoidable continuity with the other attitudes which shape one’s life, evenat times before these collisions have happened, with a view to being ready withsome sort of a usable world-view when they do. And scientific education ought tomake a great deal more provision for this.As things are, however, what we have is an unnoticed oscillation between a verynarrow view of science – useful for blocking arguments and shrugging offresponsibilities – and a very wide one, useful for issuing unexplained demandsin its name. In this wide sense, the interests of science as such have oftenbeen represented as calling for technological developments which could only beproperly justified by social demands.Thus, over genetic engineering, Francis Crick, the much discussed and Nobelprize-winning co-discoverer of DNA, no less, sternly prophesies as follows:‘Provided mankind neither blows itself up nor completely fouls up theenvironment, and is not overrun by rabid anti-science fanatics, we can expect tosee major efforts to improve the nature of man himself within the next tenthousand years’ (my italics).1 [22_Notes.html#fn-c07_en1] (The use of the word‘we’ here is interesting.) But why should such opposition be ‘anti-science’? Inwhat way is ‘science’ committed to this project? The answer appears to be thatCrick accepts the Lamarckian and Spencerian view of evolution as a firmprinciple of science, and sees it as predicting – nay, demanding – the continuedupward development of the human species. Unless this is right, science, simplyas such, gives no preference for this sort of investigation over the countlessothers which compose it at any moment. And as current scientific theories do notactually support this principle at all, Crick’s cry remains totally unexplained.Does he believe in the Spencerian prediction or not? On the face of things, theprinciple to which he is appealing looks rather like one which has commonly beenseen as faulty both in Marxism and in the Gospel of St Matthew. It might be amatter of saving the face of science. Thus St Matthew often says that certainthings were done ‘that it might be fulfilled which was foretold by theprophets’, and this is generally now thought not to be a very sensible aim. Theidea of a duty to make a prediction come true is certainly an odd one.If, however, avoiding this kind of appeal, we rest the case forsuperman-building on its own desirability, it must then compete on its meritswith other proposed human schemes. When it does this, its most striking featureseems to be its irrelevance to all current, or reasonably predictable, humanneeds and problems. It is not going to arrest any of the shouting ills of thepresent. It is not the answer to world hunger or the arms race. But neither doesit have the merit, which usually belongs to more remote ideals, of supplying adirection for our present conduct. Notions like perpetual peace or thebrotherhood of man are real working ideals; they can change our conduct in thepresent even if we think them unattainable. But the idea of a superman-blueprintsomewhere in the pipeline does not seem to have any possible moral application,except to demand resources and perhaps to make us shelve immediate problems inthe hope that the superpeople will solve them. It is not an ideal at all but anexpedient, and one which could not be put in hand until existing clashes ofideals had been resolved – a condition which itself probably presupposes aUtopia.Problem of the Superfluous MultitudesTheodosius Dobzhansky, who holds a much more clear-headed, sensitive and humanevariant of the same general faith in evolution towards better humans, isseriously worried by the thought that those of us outside the laboratories maynot find that it gives our lives much meaning. He is at least aware that noteverybody lives by the scientific ideal. He asks:Are the multitudes supererogatory? They may seem so, in view of the fact thatthe intellectual and spiritual advances are chiefly the works of eliteminorities. To a large extent, they are due to an even smaller minority ofindividuals of genius. The destiny of a vast majority of humans is death oroblivion. Does this majority play any role in the evolutionary advancement ofhumanity?2 [22_Notes.html#fn-c07_en2]He concludes that actually it does, that ‘we are not just manure in the soil inwhich are to grow the gorgeous flowers of elite culture’, because ‘it isimperative that there be a multitude of climbers. Otherwise the summit may notbe reached by anybody. The individually lost and forgotten multitudes have notlived in vain, provided that they too made the effort to climb.’These are dismal metaphors, and moreover very strangely chosen. Why should wetake the hasty journalist’s angle on climbing and think none of it has anydirect value except planting the flag on the last and highest peak? Fame is justa misleading spotlight; what climbers want is to climb. They work together. Sodo scientists; star systems and Nobel prizes distort what is happening. Again,the flower metaphor is strangely unbiological. Plants do not exist for the sakeof their flowers any more than flowers for the sake of the plant. Again, deathand eventual oblivion are the destiny of all, not just most humans. Nobelprize-winners are not exempt.This does not have to make anyone’s life meaningless provided that he or she canfeel part of something important which is being done. And that important thingneed not be the later production of some startling object. It begins from theliving of a satisfactory life by the group one belongs to, and the achievingthere of whatever aims are currently most needed and valued. Of course it canextend more widely, and many feel an overpowering need to spread it so far thatit does indeed conquer death. But this need for widening is not something whichcould be satisfied by pie in the future. Nobel prize-winners, even if theyexpect to help on the production of Utopia by their work, are not necessarilyspecially fulfilled or satisfactory human beings and certainly not on a peak ofhuman excellence of a different order from the non-prizewinning proles,condemned for ever to be valueless except as means. People, as Kant rightlysaid, are ends in themselves.The situation of these proles is not in the end quite as black as this passagemakes it sound, since Dobzhansky, signing up after some hesitation with themaverick Jesuit palaeontologist Teilhard de Chardin for the prospect of adeveloping spiritual cosmos called the Nöosphere, eventually takes the finalideal to be, not the intellectual perfection of a separate caste, but brotherlylove achieved by the whole human race. And brotherly love is something that canbe immediately practised, not just planned as a biochemical possibility forothers in the future. Nevertheless, the dismal limitations of an ideal which isboth centred on a narrow set of intellectual faculties and placed entirely inthe future are evident in the passage just quoted. In prophets like Day, theyare a ruling factor, since the position of outsiders is not considered at all.The scientists can find fulfilment in framing the superman, for they mean to beinside the laboratory designing him, not only to their own specifications but intheir own (improved) image. For them, self-worship is provided. But what anybodyelse could get out of it never emerges.Professions, Pygmies and PersonificationsWhy does Dobzhansky even begin to get committed to this curious scientificelitism? Perhaps we should take stock here of which elements in these propheciesmake it natural to reach for words like ‘religious’ in describing them. Speakingmore generally about faiths (see p. 16), I suggested that their most notablecharacteristic was ‘the sense of having one’s place within a whole greater thanoneself, one whose larger aims so enclose one’s own and give them point thatsacrifice for it may be entirely proper’. This whole has to be conceived ashaving its own aim or direction. In theory – say in a trade or profession – theaim might be thought of as just that wished by the people who now happen tocompose the group, a chance combination like travellers who have agreed to hirea bus. Anyone can then get out at any minute, and, by voting, the remainder canchange the bus’s direction at will.This positivist account of group activities has its uses, but it does not dojustice to the psychological realities. Social wholes in fact are almost alwaysmore than the sum of their parts, and can sometimes develop very remarkableindependent characters and forces. They can add startling elements to the livesof those who compose them, and become very hard to control. Their dangers arewell known, but their value for almost every important human activity isenormous. Even in quite unpretentious groups such as trades or professions,there is often a strong sense of a greater purpose transcending individualwishes, a purpose which carries everyone forward and which all must serve. Thissense is not in the least superstitious. It merely acknowledges the remarkablepart which joint, communal activity plays in our life.How does this kind of thing relate to the situation of the pygmy who loves hisforest, trusts it and says that it is his father and his mother? He too findshis place within a whole he did not make, and accepts its direction as givingpoint to his own. He certainly seems to be personalizing it, to be envisaging itas a superhuman being in a way in which (we would protest) western people arenot when they talk of serving Science, or of doing what modern Medicinerequires. The capital letters, we say firmly, do not put us in the position ofmeaning what the pygmy means, not even when we call for sacrifices of privateinterest to these entities and credit them with purposes transcending those oftheir group-members. Is the situation indeed totally different? I do not thinkit is half clear enough either what the pygmy means or what we mean on theseoccasions for this question to be dealt with briskly, and we must come back toit later. But what, meanwhile, about Muller and Day?Their faith is placed, it seems, in three concentric entities – the scientificprofession, the human race, and life or evolution. The direction of all three isthe same and is set by the inmost one. It is towards ever-greater ‘intelligence’in the sense of scientific achievement. Life is at times personified as theagent, and appears unmistakably for Muller as a specially abrasive kind ofinterventive scientist – shaking, shaping and grinding. If this figure is theLife Force, by the way, it has greatly changed since the days of Bergson, SamuelButler and George Bernard Shaw. Then it was female; it stood for the vast andmysterious natural fertility which mocked at human pretensions and especially atthe absurd claims of abstract intellectual systems. Now it seems to have beenchastened, and to have no subversive ideas to distract it from doing whatscientists want.The faith which Muller and Day have in these entities is by no means just thekind of faith which any of us might have in them for normal limited purposes. Itviews them as guaranteeing a most extraordinary future, one with no support inordinary empirical scientific procedures. It expresses, in fact, avalue-judgment – the judgment that scientific activity is particularly excellentand important – and credits that judgment to the creative force which it callsLife.Whether it views that force as personified is by no means clear. Theoreticallyno doubt it does not, but it is really not possible to make much sense of thenotion of evolution’s steady, careful progress towards this goal withoutlanguage so deeply teleological that it implies an agent. Is the project reallyto attribute this purpose to physical matter as a whole – to treat it as animmanent, necessary, impersonal process – and is the personal language merelythe effect of linguistic limitations? Perhaps it is, and if so, that is just theproblem with which the more serious religions struggle. They do not think thattheir gods are just people either, but they have no other language to use. Thiswill not separate Muller and Day from them. Any belief strong enough to supporttheir startling predictions is faith, non-scientific faith, in an entity ofnotable supernatural powers.What makes one unwilling to use the word ‘religious’ for this attitude is ofcourse the shortage of awe and respect. Though the discoverers are treated withreverence, the force itself which has been discovered is mainly viewed assomething to be used. As we shall see, this commonplace, exploitative attitudeis by no means necessary for evolution-worshippers; it is very different fromthose of Dobzhansky and the two Huxleys. Day and Muller operate more likesorcerers; they propose to profit by the operation of this force and compel itto do their will.Nevertheless, Day at least does take it also as a guide, as in some sense thereal owner of the purpose with which he identifies. He seems to be saying thatthe reason why we must actively press on with evolutionary business is that thissimply is the enterprise of the universe, into which we are born. Though thisview cannot be entirely disentangled from the mere prophecy that we shall do so,it is suggested by the tone. This idea, at once markedly less odious thanMuller’s approach and more shocking to contemporary humanistic thinking, is ofgreat interest and will concern us again.To sum up then:1 The belief in future events does seem to be religious. It could not bescientific unless the escalator view of evolution had been duly established, andenough further evidence had accrued round it to support these startlingpredictions. None of this has happened.2 Is there any deity involved, any supernatural creative being? Officially no,but something called Life seems to be filling that role. References to it cannotreally be taken as pure metaphor, because its function as unfailing planner isneeded to guarantee that the future part of the escalator is solid and reliable.It is probably significant, too, for this issue about deities that both Day andMuller refer to traditional ideas of the supernatural, claiming them as mereforeshadowings of what man in the future will actually be like: ‘a being besidewhich the mythical divinities of the past will seem more and more ridiculous’ asMuller joyfully observes. This is Nietzsche’s move of substituting the Supermanfor God. The idea is that superstition has been avoided, because these peoplewill be – one day – merely natural beings produced by earthly processes, butthey are still so excellent that it is legitimate for us to get the satisfactionout of thinking about them which our unregenerate ancestors got out of imagininginvented mythical figures. If, however, the prediction of their future existenceis itself nothing but a myth, this superiority can scarcely be maintained.3 Lastly, is there any characteristically religious emotion? There is not theawe, reverence and conviction of goodness which we in our own tradition think ofas central. But there is certainly some sense of vastness and majesty (‘whew’rather than ‘lord I come’) and also, with Day at least, a sense of directedness,an impression that the mere fact of belonging to this great process andrecognizing it lays a duty on us to understand its aims and help to forwardthem. This sense, I have suggested, is characteristic of faith in general, andsince in this case the faith is not just in a human group but in a non-humanprocess or force, since the underlying belief is religious, it seems that thefaith is religious too. It may be on the borderline between religion and magic,but that borderline is much wider and much less easy to diagnose than hassometimes been suggested. Sorcerers can sometimes take the forces they deal withvery seriously indeed.Second ThoughtsSo much for the general conceptual framework. About Day’s Genesis on PlanetEarth, however, a further postscript seems in order, because it has come out ina second edition with extremely interesting changes and non-changes.3[22_Notes.html#fn-c07_en3] Professor Lynn Margulis, herself an eminent molecularbiologist and co-launcher with James Lovelock of the Gaia Hypothesis,4[22_Notes.html#fn-c07_en4] has noted the excellence of its scientific contentand has supplied a foreword recommending it strongly as a textbook andexplaining that it has been pruned of certain irrelevant naïveties whichformerly spoilt it.It is no surprise, therefore, to find that the last chapter has gone, and thatthere is now no reference to Omega man or to genetic engineering. What is asurprise is to find what replaces these. This is a whole new chapter ofprediction, now much vaguer but every bit as fervent, intense and evangelical,about the new levels to which mankind is just about to ascend. The argument fromthe diminishing intervals between earlier stages of evolution remains asconfident as ever. There seems no suspicion that it could be unsafe toextrapolate a curve of development – if indeed this is one – without referenceto conditions outside that curve. The argument is exactly like that which wouldprove that each of us will live to fourscore years, because that is what ourdevelopmental cycle dictates – except indeed that Day’s is an argument from asingle case, and one where our information is extremely scanty, since we knownothing of the development of any other biosphere and very little about our own.Most developmental curves end in a crash. Day does see the problems posed by theincreasing energy consumption of higher forms of life. But since he is convincedthat the progress will not stop, this only leads him to a more ferventadmiration for the beings at hand who will surmount this obstacle:As happened with the eucaryotes, our potential will catapult us into a greaterdimension…Space is vacant, the lands are barren, inviting, like a repetition ofthat event at the dawn of the Cambrian…The vastness of space holds us in awe andslowly pulls us towards it like an irresistible magnet…And now the cycle isapproaching a full turn. The procaryotes lost their preeminence not solelybecause they poisoned their environment but because they were on the edge of alarger dimension and created an energy potential that could propel a greaterform of life into it. We too, stand poised on a springboard, surveying thedirection of our future…Machines are on the path toward self-sufficiency, likethe biological cells. We may even build into them our consciousness and makethem sufficiently independent that we inadvertently launch them on their ownevolution…Eventually man’s role may be phased out and he will remain in anarrested state of development like the procaryotic microbe in his dropletuniverse, while his creation goes on to greater dimensions.5[22_Notes.html#fn-c07_en5]Machine-worship – the cultivation of machines as an end in themselves and not asa means to something else – is a perversion which I cannot discuss fully here,though it probably has quite a lot to do with the obsessions we are dealingwith. I have considered it elsewhere,6 [22_Notes.html#fn-c07_en6] and I thinkthat Erich Fromm was probably right to connect it firmly with necrophilia andthe death-wish – with a preference for lifeless over living matter. What needssaying here, however, is that there is no scientific reason at all for Day’seuphoria. The confidence in this particular developmental curve to do this jobis entirely arbitrary.If indeed an evolutionary change is at hand, the most likely prediction by faris that it might be one involving the extinction of the human race. But, givingor taking a millennium or two, it seems wild to suppose that we are in anyposition to predict anything firmly about it. Again, however, Day certainly doesnot stand alone. He is exceptional only in his bold and open stance: others areoften more cautious. But anyone who raises questions about beliefs of this kindwill, I think, find that the responses they get confirm my own experience. Thisis the faith by which many people live.One very striking fact about current expressions of it is that they arecontriving to turn to their own purposes an idea which, on any reasonableinterpretation, puts them out of business altogether – namely, the GaiaHypothesis. This is the theory, developed by James Lovelock and Lynn Margulisherself, that the biosphere is in some sense a single organism, aself-regulating whole which operates by its own laws in such a way as topreserve life. In his new conclusion, Day refers to this notion in a way whichmakes clear that he supposes it to mean that we are safe whatever we do; becauseGaia, our supernatural backer, will pay all the bills, and can be assumed toapprove of our enterprises, since she has herself deliberately evolved us tomake them.This is the direct opposite of the moral drawn by Lovelock and Margulis. Theirpoint essentially was that our large-scale enterprises are trenching on a vastand delicate mechanism which we do not understand – that the survival of lifeitself has already been a far more chancy and fragile thing than is usuallyrecognized, involving forces not yet understood by us, and the survival of anyparticular species, such as our own, must depend on a subtle balance among otherlife forms. The unlimited expansion of any particular one cannot fail tothreaten this balance.If we personalize her, this Gaia does not look at all like Day’s soft-heartedmillionairess coming in at the end of the film to guarantee the hero’s future.She is much more like Nemesis, or Charles Kingsley’s Mrs Bedonebyasyoudid in TheWater Babies. If she finds her system getting out of kilter because one elementin it is insatiably greedy, she simply ditches that element as she has done somany others before. She is not in the least anthropocentric and has no specialinterest in intelligence. She is in fact impersonal, impartial Nature – notspecially red in tooth and claw, but resolute to remain in general green andalive, and therefore liable to cross the projects of those who are acting so asto turn the green, thriving world into a desert. And if this resistance fails,she herself can no doubt be killed with all her children. No universal fail-safemechanism protects either her or us.Just what the Gaia Hypothesis means, and how it can best be related tobiological science, is of course a large question. To see a non-reproducingentity as an organism, and a purposive one, without the benefit of pastadaptation through selection, is not a straightforward project. Still,supporters of the idea have brought forward detailed evidence to suggest thatsomething of the kind may be needed, and the matter certainly deservesconsideration. What concerns us in this book, however, is the function of theidea as a myth.For this use it seems both sufficiently clear and very valuable. As an answer toanthropocentrism – as a reminder that we really are just one species amongothers, with no celestial warrant for general destruction – it can work and itcan express much-needed truths. The startling enterprise of distorting it to dojust the opposite – to boost anthropocentrism and increase over-confidence – isone more proof of the extraordinary force of existing pseudo-scientificsuperstitions."},{"pageContent":" 8 Dazzling ProspectsWe want a man hag-ridden by the Future … dependent for his faith on the successor failure of schemes whose end he will not live to see. We want a whole race inpursuit of the rainbow’s end, never honest, nor kind, nor happy now, but alwaysusing as mere fuel wherewith to heap the altar of the Future every real giftwhich is offered them in the Present… . We have trained them to think of theFuture as a promised land which only heroes attain – not as something whicheveryone reaches at the rate of sixty minutes an hour, whatever he does, whoeverhe is.C. S. Lewis, The Screwtape Letters, Chs XV and XXVClaims for the Future of ScienceLet us turn now to a slightly different kind of prophecy, concerned mainly withthe rosy future of science itself, but also indicating the route by which it isto bring about a general reform of life. It is from the sociobiologist Edward O.Wilson:When mankind has achieved an ecological steady state, probably by the end of thetwenty-first century, the internalization of social evolution will be nearlycomplete. About this time biology should be at its peak, with the socialsciences maturing rapidly … cognition will be translated into circuitry.Learning and creativeness will be defined as the alteration of specific portionsof the cognitive machinery regulated by input from the emotive centers. Havingcannibalized psychology, the new neurobiology will yield an enduring set offirst principles for sociology… . Skinner’s dream of a culture predesigned forhappiness will surely have to wait for the new neurobiology. A geneticallyaccurate and hence completely fair code of ethics must also wait.1[22_Notes.html#fn-c08_en1]This means, however, that we shall get it in the end, once the neuro-biologistshave done their stuff. Wilson admits indeed that some of us may not like thisfuture world when we get it, partly, it seems, because of worries about geneticengineering. But this will be due to our unscientific attitude. It affectsneither the dogmatic confidence of the prediction, nor the desirability of theoutcome from the impersonal, scientific point of view.The point about dogmatic confidence is interesting. Scrupulous moderation inmaking factual claims is commonly seen as a central part of the scientificattitude. Julian Huxley, listing the bad habits which infest religion, naturallymentions ‘dogmatism’ and ‘aspiring to a false certitude’ among them and explainsthat science corrects these vices.2 [22_Notes.html#fn-c08_en2] Remarks likethose just quoted do not on the face of it seem to meet this standard.When I have complained of this sort of thing to scientists, I have sometimes meta surprising defence, namely, that these remarks appear in the opening orclosing chapters of books, and that everybody knows that what is found there isnot to be taken literally; it is just flannel for the general public. The ideaseems to be that supplying such flannel constitutes a kind of a ritual. If so,it must surely strengthen our present unease, since addition to ritual isanother fault supposed to be the mark of religion.The point might of course just be the more practical one of selling books. Butif grossly inflated claims to knowledge of the future are made for that reason,then there is either common dishonesty for personal profit, or an attempt toadvance the cause of science by methods which disgrace it, and which (again)have always been considered a disgrace to religion. Putting these prophecies ina special part of the book does not disinfect them. It cannot be more excusableto peddle groundless predictions to the defenceless general public, who willtake them to have the full authority of science, than to one’s professionalcolleagues, who know much better what bees infest one’s bonnet. These boldprophecies of an escalating future are often combined, as they are here, withthe vision of one’s own Science in a gold helmet finally crushing its academicrivals: again, scarcely a monument to scientific balance and caution.Drawbacks of the Escalator ModelIs all this euphoria, however, actually dangerous? If the escalator myth reallyhas got out of hand, what harm does it do?In one way, certainly, it does much less harm than the egoistic myth ofuniversal cut-throat competition. Optimism in general, even when it is muddled,tends to do less harm than pessimism. Faith in life, and in the human race, iscertainly a better thing to have around than a supposedly science-basedconviction of universal bloody-mindedness and hypocrisy. But once we are clearabout that, we need to notice some objections, and as they have had much lessattention than those which arise to the competitive myth, they may need moreemphasis.In the first place, faith in life and in the human race becomes much lessevident when we turn from those who rely on continued natural growth, likeTeilhard and Dobzhansky, to the champions of genetic engineering. Calling forsurgical methods always shows less faith in the patient’s constitution and morein the skills of the surgeon. The question, in what do you put your faith? iscentral to the whole enquiry. Those who put it in genetic engineering seem togive us what we now get so often here, an answer which misses the point of thequestion. They want us to put faith in certain techniques, or at most in theintellectual skills and capacities which make those techniques possible. But allthese are means. What we need is to hear about aims, and about the faculties inall of us which reach out to those aims. What we get is a recommendation toentrust change to a certain set of experts, whose training has not called onthem to pay any attention to conflicting aims at all.The genetic engineering proposal, however, is not a necessary part of theescalator myth. Is there anything harmful about that myth itself, if we considerit in its more natural and consistent form as a simple prediction of steady,indefinite future human genetic progress to heights hitherto undreamed of?I have already touched on the objection that this prediction, if it is taken ascertain and infallible, gives a quite unwarranted sense of security, and caneasily distract us from the need for other changes. If it is not taken ascertain, but still as providing the only guideline towards safety, it admits thedangers but tells us, without argument, to rely on one particular way ofescaping them rather than others, namely genetic engineering. And I think thatthose who do rely on it are in fact led by this way of thinking, not by any realevidence that this is a better prospect than other possible means of salvation.What, however, if no special question is raised about inevitability, but thisprogress is simply presented as the destiny offered to the human race? Thissomewhat vaguer picture is inspiring but a trifle dazzling. It may help us inassessing it to let the objector open the argument.The central difficulty is that this story is arbitrarily human-centred, and thatits view of humanity is at present arbitrarily intellect-centred. Itshuman-centredness distorts both evolutionary theory and our attitude to thenatural world. By what right, and in what sense, can we consider ourselves asthe directional pointer and aim-bearer of the whole evolutionary process? Doesthis mean what is often taken for granted today in controversy about thetreatment of plants and animals, that all other organisms exist only as means toour ends? Kant and other philosophers have said this, many people believe it,yet it remains extremely obscure.3 [22_Notes.html#fn-c08_en3]The idea that things are there for some external purpose seems to need atheological context, and this view did of course grow out of one. But thatcontext will not subjugate everything to man. Certainly Judaeo-Christianthinking made the human race much more central than many other religions do, butit still considered man to be God’s steward. Divine aims were always paramount,and God had created all his creatures for his own purposes, not for man’s.Non-human beings count in this picture as having their own special value.Redwoods and pythons, frogs, moles and albatrosses are not failed humans orearly try-outs for humans or tools put there to advance human development.When this is spelled out, people today usually accept it, yet the escalatorpicture tends quietly and constantly to obscure it. Lamarck, who invented theescalator concept, did consider all non-human animals to be standing behind man,engaged on the same journey, and this still persisting idea does inevitablysuggest that they are inferior and expendable. It obscures our enormousignorance about their lives, about what it is like to be (say) a whale, agorilla, an elephant, a mouse or a battery chicken, and supports our naturalconviction that anything we don’t do or experience can’t have any value. Themore we put aside this obviously hasty and inadequate myth, and notice theendless variety of existing creatures, the more we shall be driven to forget thelinear metaphor of height, and return to the more Darwinian image of theradiating bush.Which Way is up?Is there, however, still a fixed upward dimension? Does the bush have a humantip? Are we in some sense the point of the whole? I have never myself felt theneed to say this, but very many people do, and the point must be takenseriously. it may well be that any intelligent species, able to meditate on suchthings, must in some way think of itself as central in the whole world, becausein its own world it is so. It may be morally necessary to treat our own destinyas the most important thing conceivable, if only because we cannot easilyconceive anything greater. But this by no means licenses us to separate it fromall others and pursue it at their expense, nor does it mean, asescalator-fanciers sometimes kindly suggest, that our duty to those behind us isto help them to become like ourselves as quickly as possible. The moralconsequences of a serious attitude to our own destiny are excellent, but thoseof a contemptuous attitude to other destinies are quite another matter. The twoshould not be linked at all.Turning from morals to theory, could this way of thinking license us to predictthat the next thing the bush will do is to grow taller? Change in humansocieties is now almost entirely a cultural, not a genetic matter, and it can aseasily be for the worse as for the better. It is commonly recognized today thatwe badly need to be clear about this, since the belief in inevitable progresscan be, and has been, used to justify bad changes which were preventable.Even, therefore, if we had reason to expect genetic change, this would not showthat such change was good, nor that it was outside our control. And even if wehad sound theoretical grounds for expecting the genetic development of our ownspecies into something still greater and more distinctively human, this couldscarcely show that we were the single supremely valuable object which gave pointto the whole evolutionary process. There does not have to be any such oneobject. And since there are no such theoretical grounds either – since thisexpectation has no place in Darwinian theory, and came to Lamarck and Spencersimply as a welcome, self-justifying hunch – it is very remarkable thatscientifically educated people still continue to ask the question which standsas title to the last chapter of William Day’s book, from which I have alreadyquoted, the question ‘Where is evolution headed?’4 [22_Notes.html#fn-c08_en4]The Future as Magnifying MirrorHow does this question arise? If we look at the literature which asks it andattempts to give it answers, a very simple answer becomes almost unavoidable. Itis a way of dramatizing morals. One can give a peculiar force to the praise andexaltation of particular ideals by presenting them as a piece of foresight, aglance at a real, attainable though perhaps distant future. This is an ancient,natural and legitimate device, which lies at the root of prophecy. Both bad andgood futures can be used, but if the moral leverage is to work, both must bepresented as only possible. There must still be time to work for this ‘future’or avert it. Both author and reader must therefore be clear that the vision isan imaginary one, and this literature must be kept separate from the relativelyhumdrum business of prediction.Sober predictions about the likely future development of terrestrial life wouldnot carry any such moral message. They would not necessarily make human affairscentral at all, but would refer to them only in so far as they seem likely toaffect the development of ecosystems. But the prophecies which now concern usare not in the least like this. They are quite simply exaltations of particularideals within human life at their own epoch, projected on to the screen of avague and vast ‘future’ – a term which, since Nietzsche and Wells, is not a namefor what is particularly likely to happen, but for a fantasy realm devoted tothe staging of visionary dramas.In their content, these dramas plainly depend on the moral convictions of theirauthor and of his age, not on scientific theories of any kind. Nietzsche, wholaid down the ground-rules of this game, used Darwinian ideas and language as apedestal for his own preferred ideal type, the unsocial, anarchic, creativeindividual, his enlarged and exalted self:Ye lonely ones of to-day; ye that stand apart, ye shall one day be a people;from you, that have chosen yourselves, a chosen people shall arise – and fromit, the Superman… .And the Great Noon shall be when man standeth in the midst of his course betweenbeast and Superman… . Dead are all gods; now will we that the Superman live.5[22_Notes.html#fn-c08_en5]And, more prosaically:The problem I raise here is not what ought to succeed mankind (the human beingis an end) but what type of human being one ought to breed, ought to will, asmore valuable, more worthy of life, more certain of the future.6[22_Notes.html#fn-c08_en6]The mark of this favoured and expected type is not just that he is free from thetrammels of existing religion and morality, but that he is a fully unified humanbeing, free from the many bad habits which at present divide our nature. He isto reunite spirit and intellect, which now wither in pretentious isolation, withtheir strong roots in the body, the imagination and the passions. Althoughexternally he is isolated, contemptuous of social links with his fellows,internally he balances this isolation by the strongest possible integration ofhis nature.Indeed Nietzsche’s hostility to outward social bonds is largely a protestagainst their tendency to fragment the individual’s being. And, amongcontemporary influences which promote this fatal division, he thinks theexaltation of the bare intellect, especially in its scientific form, every bitas pernicious as the Christian religion:The harsh helot condition to which the tremendous extent of science hascondemned every single person to-day is one of the main reasons why educationand educators appropriate to fuller, richer, deeper natures are no longerforthcoming. Our culture suffers from nothing more than it suffers from thesuperabundance of presumptuous journeymen and fragments of humanity.7[22_Notes.html#fn-c08_en7]And again:From a doctorate exam. – ‘What is the task of all higher education?’ – To turn aman into a machine – ‘By what means?’ He has to learn how to feel bored. ‘How isthis achieved?’ – Through the concept of duty… . ‘Who is the perfect man?’ Thecivil servant.8 [22_Notes.html#fn-c08_en8]Thus Nietzsche; do we like his future? If not, the Jesuit biologist Teilhard deChardin offers us quite a different one, in which Nietzsche’s twin abominations,physical science and Christianity, are both to be exalted and to find theirfinal synthesis. It was Teilhard who invented the phrase ‘Omega man’, using itto describe a future being, raised above us both spiritually and intellectually,whose destiny it is to complete the divine plan for this earth by perfecting itat the mental level – to add a nöosphere, or intellectual realm, to the livingrealm, or biosphere, which is already present. In this ideal future, the idea ofbrotherly love and of the mystical union of individuals in the whole – an idealwhich would have been pure ratsbane to Nietzsche – plays a central part, andtraditional Christianity, however difficult it may be to fit in with thisambitious scheme, is certainly still conceived as the main guiding thread.Scientists as SupermenDo both these suggestions strike some readers today as a trifle crazy? It cannotbe too strongly emphasized how much this impression of craziness depends oncurrent moral and intellectual habits. What will our own look like, to those whohave ceased to share them? And what is actually in the minds of those who makeparallel suggestions today?I shall go on using William Day’s book Genesis on Planet Earth, because it seemsto me to put exceptionally clearly ideas which are very widely accepted, andseldom as well expressed. Day writes throughout as if only one sort ofimprovement could possibly be in question, namely a rise in intelligence, and hetreats intelligence as a term which could not possibly be ambiguous or needanalysis. To increase this intelligence is, he says, the purpose of all life: anidea which he presents as needing no defence or explanation. His language aboutthis is flagrantly teleological, indeed vitalist:Life has endured, generation after generation, producing more than can live,sacrificing many that the most fit may survive. Species have followed species,rung after rung, in a continuous climb of the ladder called evolution. And inthat long ascent, life has retained rapport with its surroundings by evolvingits window on the universe – intelligence.9 [22_Notes.html#fn-c08_en9]What is meant by speaking of intelligence as a window, and why should such awindow furnish the point of the whole? If windows matter so much, must it not bebecause what we see through them is important, and if it is, must there not beother valuable things besides intelligence?Windows are a means. Is the function we are talking about just the acquiring andordering of information? or does it include certain deep ways of responding toit? Those who originally put this great stress on intelligence into Europeanthought meant by it something enormously wider than mere ordered storage. BothPlato and Aristotle, who differed so much on countless other points, agreed inmaking the point of the whole intellectual enterprise consist in thecontemplation to which it led: the awareness of a vast outer whole, within whichhuman thought operates, and of which it can form only the faintest image. Daysees no such difficulty. Reality for him is what we make it through science:It is into all reality that life, led by man, is expanding. Reality is no longerrestricted to the horizons of the senses, but extends to the far reachesconceived by the mind. Physical reality may or may not be finite, for whatexists is what we perceive, or identify as reality, and how far we can extendreality is uncertain.10 [22_Notes.html#fn-c08_en10]Resisting the temptation to go into all the implications of this – does itactually mean that reality is what physicists say it is, and if so how do theyknow what to say? – I stick to the point which now concerns us, namely that thecentral business of the mind, the work for which ‘life’ has evolved it, is herephysical science. Omega man emerges as quite simply a superscientist. Only atone point does it look as if he might have any other interests: where Day saysthat man’s ‘intelligence has evolved where, unlike any other form of life, he istouching on a new dimension. It is man’s spirituality, psyche and superego, andthat part of man [sic] that makes him the forerunner of Omega man.’11[22_Notes.html#fn-c08_en11] But these mysterious dimensions have already beenmentioned and been explained as being simply physical: ‘real dimensions of timeand space, beyond our reach in size and perception’.12[22_Notes.html#fn-c08_en12] Materialism is not being compromised. To settle thatpoint finally, Day goes on:A type of intelligence more evolved than man’s could conceive of a reality andexercise control over it in a manner beyond our ability to comprehend. Whatcomprehension and powers over nature Omega man will be able to command can onlybe suggested by man’s image of the supernatural. (my italics)13[22_Notes.html#fn-c08_en13]The mention of spirituality proves to have been only a ritual one. The realpoint of all this intelligence, and therefore of evolution itself, was, it turnsout, simply to put more physical power in the hands of the quasi-deified humanspecies, even though that species seems already to have a great deal morephysical power than it knows what to do with."},{"pageContent":" 9 Black Holes: Jacques Monod and the Isolation of ‘Science’Let, unaccompanied, that psalm beginWhich deals most harshly with the fruits of Sin.John BetjemanDarker ForecastsA similar exclusive exaltation of science appears, with some interestingdifferences, at the end of Steven Weinberg’s excellent and informative littlebook The First Three Minutes: A Modern View of the Origin of the Universe. Hislast chapter is called ‘Epilogue: the prospect ahead’, and it ends thus:The more the universe seems comprehensible, the more it also seems pointless.But if there is no solace in the fruits of our research, there is at least someconsolation in the research itself. Men and women are not content to comfortthemselves with tales of gods and giants, or to confine their thoughts to thedaily affairs of life; they also build telescopes and satellites andaccelerators, and sit at their desks for endless hours working out the meaningof the data they gather. The effort to understand the universe is one of thevery few things that lifts human life a little above the level of farce, andgives it some of the grace of tragedy.1 [22_Notes.html#fn-c09_en1]Since virtually the whole book has been devoted to expounding astrophysics, notto discussing it as an occupation, and certainly not to discussing otheroccupations with which it might compete, Weinberg’s readers might find this anunexpected blow. They might feel rather shaken and degraded by the suddenrevelation that their lives are probably valueless, and they might also ask thereasonable question: how does Weinberg know? And what has he in mind about therest of the few competing non-farcical elements in life? Is there any hope forcultures other than our own, which do not build telescopes and satellites andaccelerators, that is for most of the people there have ever been, of doinganything worth while at all?What Weinberg means about tragedy has emerged in the previous paragraph. Itturns out, he says, that this is an ‘overwhelmingly hostile universe’, hostilein the sense that it existed long before us and is not going to preserve us forever. On current predictions, it will all eventually vanish, and when theconditions which we inhabit go, they will take us with them. Why this shouldmake us denounce the universe as hostile rather than – if we are going to beanthropomorphic – make us call it generous for producing and sustaining us,Weinberg does not say. The script which he follows here seems to be the quitewidely accepted one produced by Jacques Monod, who, as we have seen,2[22_Notes.html#fn-c09_en2] states as the message of science the claim that man‘must realise that, like a gypsy, he lives on the boundary of an alien world’.This is surprising news for evolutionary biologists, whose science has for thelast century been busy delivering exactly the opposite message, namely that manwas born here and had better acknowledge the place as his native home. What isgoing on?Monod’s picture is of great interest. Its wide success shows how stronglyscientists, and others who put their faith in science, have felt the need for aclearer articulation of that faith. Popper’s determined narrowing of sciencecould not of itself provide that articulation, because it was too negative. Itsimply declared by fiat that only certain things could be allowed to count asscience, and surrounded them on the map by an area marked terra incognita.For this area the word ‘metaphysics’ was indeed used. But it did not carry thereits proper meaning as the study of certain central topics in philosophy.Whatever Popper meant by it, to most of its hearers it was just a generalabusive term for non-scientific thinking, often read as simply synonymous with‘nonsense’. Thus the theory of evolution itself was for some time excluded fromscience as metaphysical, though it is manifestly a historical theory, and thiswas widely seen as down-grading its importance. (The idea that a theory couldhave both historical and scientific aspects seems not to have crossed anyone’smind.) Geography and geology, too, because of the particularity of theirsubject-matter, were viewed as parts of metaphysics rather than as separatesciences, and cosmology naturally came under similar suspicion.In short, just at the time when the special, unique value of science, and itsdistinctness from all other studies, were being most strongly asserted, itsfrontiers were cast into grave confusion. Moreover, the very reasons for valuingit so highly became hard to state. Discussing them would have involveddiscussing also the values of other ideals to which it is related, and this wasruled to fall outside scientific business. The best way out would probably havebeen to revise the map which isolated science, noting its connections with otherstudies, and making any exclusions which were needed much clearer and moreselective. Marxist and Freudian thinking needed to be more closely examined,their merits conceded and their defects more sharply defined. And the meaning of‘science’ itself, with the implied compliment it conveyed, needed to be mademuch clearer.Monod, however, offered a most welcome and seductive dramatization of theexisting confused position instead of this rather gruelling programme. He simplytook the Popperian map and projected existentialist colouring on to it tosatisfy the imagination. For terra incognita he invited us to read ‘tragicdarkness’. For the accidental, temporary isolation of science from otherstudies, we should read ‘the incurable isolation of man’. We should accept themortification of our reason produced by the impossibility of extending ourunderstanding beyond the borders of science as a test of our courage;authenticity would demand that we made no attempt to breach it. In his anxietyto get rid of irrelevant thinking, Monod made huge inroads on the province ofthought. This move was only made to look plausible by the importation of a wholenew mass of feeling, of a drama which did duty for argument. It is no accidentwhich leads Weinberg to talk of farce and tragedy. Monod’s thinking, likeSartre’s, is essentially melodramatic.The Attack on ‘Animism’Monod’s aim is to get rid of what he calls animism, a term which he uses verywidely. It covers, not just the idea that a conscious, purposive being hasdevised the universe to produce us, but also any notion of laws which have madeour presence here necessary. ‘We would like’, he says, ‘to think ourselvesnecessary, inevitable, ordained from all eternity. All religions, nearly allphilosophies, and even a part of science testify to the unwearying, heroiceffort of mankind desperately denying its own contingency.’3[22_Notes.html#fn-c09_en3] He notes with alarm the strength of this tendency:At the very core of certain ideologies claiming to be founded on science, theanimist projection, in a more or less disguised form, turns up again… . It wasnot Teilhard who discovered the idea of reestablishing the old animist covenantwith nature, or of founding a new one through a universal theory according towhich the evolution of the biosphere culminating in man would be part of thesmooth onward flow of cosmic evolution itself. This idea was in fact the centraltheme of nineteenth-century scientistic progressism. One finds it at the veryheart of Spencer’s positivism and of Marx and Engels’ dialectical materialism.4[22_Notes.html#fn-c09_en4]Monod was surely right to resist this over-ambitious reliance on the escalatormodel and the inflated creeds which express it. They are the source of thesuperstitions we have been examining, and of much other evil too. The difficultyis to cut out what is noxious in them without slicing into either the livingtissue of science itself or other necessary parts of our thought. Monod rantogether under the name of animism at least four quite distinct ideas: (1) thatthe human race is a necessary phenomenon, predictable according to scientificlaws; (2) that it provides the central purpose of the universe; (3) thatevolution is an escalator leading smoothly up to it; and (4) that it iscontinuous with, and at home in, the surrounding world.The first three are indeed mistakes, but different mistakes; the fourth is animportant truth. Against all four equally, Monod sets the one idea of our‘contingency’, which accordingly gets very obscure.Much of his book consists of scientific arguments directed against the first ofthe four ideas. He brings evidence to show that chance has intruded at variousstages in the development of life, notably in producing mutations and inwhatever mysterious and highly improbable process set life itself going in thefirst place. He wants to show sharp discontinuity, first between the inanimateworld and life, which will thus become a surd, unpredictable, alien event withinit, and then between the entire physical world and our minds.Monod’s aim is to introduce enough disorder into the cosmos to quash theargument from design altogether. He thinks that earlier mechanistic materialismfailed to do this because, in presenting the universe as a perfect superclock,it left too much temptation to bring back the clockmaker. Laplace, theeighteenth-century theorist who first supplied science with the alluring modelof the physical world as a faultless clock with no maker, had ruled that Godmust never be reintroduced, but (says Monod) he is not being obeyed. Modernscience must complete his work by showing that there is real confusion in thecosmic order. This will finally discredit animism – though Monod admits thatatheistic discipline will still be very hard to maintain.Order Without an OrdererIt is a very interesting question how far it is possible to separate the senseof order in this way from any notion of an ordering mind. This is a much biggerproject than that of merely casting doubts on any particular creed or faiththrough which that sense has been expressed. Certainly, the more anthropomorphica creed is, the more the notion of an arbitrary, personal will enters intothoughts of creation. And clearly that notion is hostile to science. But theobjection to an arbitrary will is that it runs counter to what mind demands,that is, counter to order. And order is what science studies; if it is toproceed on any given subject-matter, it has to assume in advance that there willbe order there, that it will be penetrable to mind. It seems quite possible thatfrom the human point of view at least the notions of mind and order are at rootinseparable, that order is almost inevitably perceived as the expression ofmind. T. H. Huxley, that stern and splendid old fighter against all that wasbase in religion, has some very interesting remarks about this:If imagination is used within the limits laid down by science, disorder isunimaginable. If a being endowed with perfect intellectual and aestheticfaculties, but devoid of the capacity for suffering pain, either physical ormoral, were to devote his utmost powers to the investigation of nature, theuniverse would seem to him to be a sort of kaleido-scope, in which, at everysuccessive moment of time, a new arrangement of parts of exquisite beauty andsymmetry would present itself, and each of them would show itself to be thelogical consequence of the preceding arrangement, under the conditions which wecall the laws of nature. Such a spectator might well be filled with that Amorintellectualis Dei, the beatific vision of the vita contemplativa, which some ofthe greatest thinkers of all ages, Aristotle, Aquinas, Spinoza, have regarded asthe only conceivable eternal felicity; and the vision of illimitable sufferings,as if sensitive beings were unregarded animal-cules which had got between thebits of glass of the kaleidoscope, which mars the prospect to us poor mortals,in no wise alters the fact that order is lord of all, and disorder only a namefor that part of the order which gives us pain.5 [22_Notes.html#fn-c09_en5]Do Monod’s modern discoveries really affect this position? It is hard to see howthey could. Huxley is not relying on any simple, Laplacian idea of a clock, asingle universal mechanism. He is talking more widely about any order whichsatisfies the intellect. The only scientific area, among those which Monodcites, that breaks with the normal idea of causal order is quantum mechanism.This does not posit chaos instead; it substitutes a statistical order. Andphysicists, in so far as they are satisfied with this concept, accept it aspenetrable to mind. They are not in fact wholly satisfied with it, because ofdifficulties in relating it to some of their other concepts. They are thereforecurrently busy in revising their epistemology. They seem likely to move furtheraway from regarding this or any other of their models as final and directdescriptions of the world, and towards treating each as having only limited andprovisional use. It would accordingly be very naïve to use quantum mechanics asMonod apparently wants to, to prove a lapse of order as an objective fact.Chance as PointlessnessThat case apart, the phenomena he cites as ‘chance’ do not involve breaks incausal sequence, but only happenings which he calls ‘“absolute coincidences”;those which result from the intersection of two totally independent chains ofevents.’6 [22_Notes.html#fn-c09_en6] He gives the example of a doctor killed bythe accidental fall of a workman’s hammer.This is a surprising idea, because it is not clear that, objectively speaking,there are any absolute coincidences at all. In the causal network, no two chainsare independent, and the identification of chains itself requires an interest.Besides, we would still call this event a chance one even if doctor and workmanwere closely connected causally, for instance if they were twin brothers workingon the same job. The use of chance here is surely the everyday one where itmeans ‘something irrelevant to purpose’. And this is actually the only sense itcan bear in Monod’s references to genetics also.His point is that neither the mechanism of mutation nor the changing environmentis subject to any purpose of the developing organisms whose evolution theycontrol. This is no doubt a fair point against his second target, the beliefthat the universe was made for man. It is true that neither in our owndevelopment nor in that of the organisms we must deal with does there seem tohave been a special directional control for our interests. Natural selection isno more, if no less, on our side than on that of the wasp or the tapeworm. Wehave been lucky so far, but that need not last. This target, however, is an easyone to hit and certainly does not require the special scientific reasoningswhich Monod employs. There are plenty of other objections to it besides thescientific oddity of the notion of the human race as necessary.Chance as UnpredictabilityThe notion that mankind might be necessary in the sense of being strictlypredictable, like the falling of a dropped stone, seems to be something of astraw man. Biology does not deal in that sort of predictability for large-scaleevents. Because living systems are so complex, it needs constantly to vary itsconcepts according to its subject-matter, and is not given to claiming necessityfor historical occurrences, though it often has a good deal to say aboutprobability. The crude alternatives of pure chance and pure necessity whichMonod deals in are not suited to it at all. As Dobzhansky remarks:This dichotomy, applied by Monod to biological as well as human evolution, isspurious. Evolution is neither necessary, in the sense of being predestined, noris it a matter of chance or accident. It is governed by natural selection, inwhich ingredients of chance and anti-chance are blended in a way which makes thedichotomy meaningless, and which renders evolution to be a creative process… .The chance in mutation is blind, but it is neither ‘pure’ nor ‘absolutely free’…. Natural selection is an antichance agent. Its action however does not amountto necessity. Its outcome is unpredictable in the long run.7[22_Notes.html#fn-c09_en7]In short, Monod’s picture, in which certain limited areas of pure necessity –isolated clocks – stand isolated in a howling desert of entirely unpredictablechaos, is a travesty. No doubt he was encouraged to develop it by the ‘beanbag’genetic theories already mentioned, which made the behaviour of genes themselveslook much more confused and chancy than it is now known to be. It was even beingsuggested that genes were directly affected by perturbations at thequantum-mechanical level. As it happens, the whole movement of genetics in thelast half-century has been towards a much more orderly picture of genebehaviour.8 [22_Notes.html#fn-c09_en8] Genes are now increasingly seen both assimpler in their internal structure and as much more closely connected togetherthan used to be thought. Working usually in large, fairly stable blocks, theyhave nothing like the wild range of possible variation which Monod supposed. Hisviews seem to have been considerably out of date in his own day, and thescientific ideas which led him on to envisage the genetic process as a ‘giganticlottery’ are no longer plausible.Venerating the Cosmos: The Pantheist VisionThat need not make much difference, of course, to Monod’s central attack on‘animism’, which is not really concerned with the role of necessity in biology,but with the dramatization of evolution. What Huxley said is still true. Themain difficulties here are not theoretical; they are moral. The real objectionto accepting and revering the universe as an ordered whole does not spring fromthe presence of disorder in it. Indeed it is hard to see what could give ustheoretical ground for positing any such disorder; quantum mechanics surely doesnot do so. It springs from the apparently disorderly distribution of such thingsas pleasure and pain – from the difficulty of seeing how this pattern can fitinto an acceptable underlying purpose.Is it right to have faith, as the great religions do, in the existence of such apurpose? Does our acceptance of theoretical order reasonably lead us on, asSpinoza thought and Huxley did not, to recognize a level at which it merges intothe intellectual love of God? (The world had not, of course, grown grimmerbetween Spinoza’s day and Huxley’s; Spinoza wrote in a Europe ravaged by theThirty Years War and was no sort of sentimental optimist. The level must be deepindeed.)This question cannot be settled, as Comte suggested and as Freud believed,9[22_Notes.html#fn-c09_en9] by a ruling about the human life cycle, declaring allfavourable answers to it to be ipso facto childish. Our current local notion ofadulthood is a peculiar one, directly produced by positivistic thinking; itcannot serve as an independent ground for it. Nor can the question be settledsimply by the principle of parsimony. That principle rapidly begins to flounderwhen it gets away from simple cases. False economy is very common among peoplewho rely too readily on it. As we are seeing, extravagance is not eliminatedmerely by becoming anti-religious, and thoughts which are designed to be sternlyreductive often compensate by strange, illicit expansions elsewhere. In factwhen we encounter a specially harsh reduction, officially launched in the nameof parsimony, our first question should probably be ‘and what are these savingsbeing used to pay for?’"},{"pageContent":" 10 Freedom and the Monte Carlo DramaThe bastard! He doesn’t exist.J.-P. Sartre on GodMoral Scepticism and Its ExceptionsWith this large question of whether all viewing of the universe as directional,all Spinozan reverence for it, is mistaken, Monod, however, cannot help us. Longbefore this issue arises, his discussion has settled the matter with a blanketrejection, not just of the idea of purpose in nature, but of all significantconnection between ourselves and the universe around us.Monod’s ‘postulate of objectivity’, which excludes cosmic purposes; also impliesfor him that we are strangers here in the sense of inhabiting a meaninglessworld, which has no value in it and can give us absolutely no guidance aboutvalues. As has been pointed out before over Sartre’s doctrines, the notion ofour ‘self’ which this implies – the abstract, non-terrestrial will – is a verystrange one, apparently a descendant, still latent in French thought, of theisolated Cartesian pure soul. This entity becomes necessary because Monod,following Sartre, apparently recognizes only two possible sources of morality:either the direct command of God or the pure fiat of this free human will.Having displaced God in favour of chance, he again follows Sartre in carefullyexcluding all our natural sources of motivation and the background of culturalpatterns built from them. This makes it easy to rule that the world ismeaningless and all value-judgment arbitrary. Meaning is connection, so it canalways be removed from a pattern by cutting it up into sufficiently smallpieces. And with black-and-white photography, the world can easily be made tolook colourless.This is a perverse move. Moral thinking is not something like an electric light,which can be switched off at a distance in this way by removing the idea of Godas a kind of power-station. It is a branch of social thinking, articulatingstandards which necessarily arise in dealing with the chronic conflicts endemicto human life. It has a hundred sources, not just one, and seems to be anecessary feature of the interaction between intelligent beings. (Darwin maywell have been right that any sufficiently intelligent social being would needto develop it.1 [22_Notes.html#fn-c10_en1])Accordingly, a great deal of its substance arises from the conditions of humanlife and is not arbitrary at all. Where it is arbitrary, we view it aschangeable and we frequently do change it. But to do so we refer to deeper, moregeneral underlying considerations which by no means depend on our wills.Everybody, however theoretically sceptical about morals, recognizes some suchconsiderations, and argument designed – as Monod’s certainly is – to changepeople’s conduct could not possibly be carried on without presupposing them.This becomes luminously clear when Monod, like Sartre, wants to deliver avalue-judgment of his own, immune to general scepticism. For Sartre, theexception was a rather general one about the value of ‘authenticity’ itself,which is the courage to admit one’s freedom. It is indeed scarcely possible toargue the need for this without tacitly admitting both the general possibilityof moral argument and the particular importance of the standards which oneappeals to in doing it. But this means that other positions can also be put. Toestablish authenticity as the only virtue needs a lot of argument. Thecomplicated epicycles of existentialist theory are there to do this job; theyare not very successful. Monod, however, has a much bigger and more awkwardarticle to smuggle through his own customs, something far too gross to get pastany set of inspectors not already dedicated to importing it. He wants to give aspecial status to science, to show it as the one thing which does have real,undeniable value. Since he has just stressed that no values are given and thatwe must be equally free to accept or reject anything, this is hard. Monod fightsback stoutly. There is, he says, only one ideal which can be freely chosen, andthat is knowledge:In the ethic of knowledge, it is the ethical choice of a primary value that isthe foundation. The ethic of knowledge thereby differs radically from animistethics, which all claim to be based on the ‘knowledge’ of immanent religious or‘natural’ laws which are supposed to impose themselves on man. The ethic ofknowledge does not impose itself on man; on the contrary, it is he who imposesit on himself, making it the axiomatic condition of authenticity for alldiscourse and all action.2 [22_Notes.html#fn-c10_en2]Other ideals, he implies, can only be chosen thoughtlessly, without freedom. Andit is ‘animistic’ to choose with reference to any purpose which is treated asalready given, since the universe itself is purposeless.Neither side of this contention can possibly work. On the one hand, other idealscertainly can be freely and deliberately chosen. Sartre’s choice of freedomitself is only one obvious example. Moral philosophy is full of carefularguments supporting such choices. Many of the arguers object radically to thesimple plan which Monod adopts of picking one single, all-sufficient ‘primaryvalue’ and treating everything else merely as a means to it. Others use thatplan, but argue for a different value. Anyone who wanted to make knowledge thedespot here would have to face the moral arguments for at least the most obviousrival contenders such as happiness, freedom, pleasure and aesthetic experience.Failure to face them certainly does not establish the champions of knowledge asspecially free, but rather as lazy-minded and dogmatic.As for the special claims of knowledge itself, it seems odd to suggest that ourpursuit of it involves no given purpose and no natural taste. We want it becausewe are naturally inquisitive. That is a contingent fact about us which mightwell have been otherwise. And the special objects which we enquire about,including those which the sciences study at any given time, are also contingent.They depend on social and personal factors of the most varied kinds. They arenot arbitrary. Our natural interest and enjoyment of these studies is a goodreason for us to pursue them individually, and the value which our society as awhole puts on the results is a good reason for it to make them possible. Butthere are also other occupations for which we have good reasons. The prioritysystems by which we place them all in our lives cannot be settled from one sideonly. A really free, deliberate judgment would need to look at all of them.Obsessive, partisan judgment is very far from free.Monod’s determination to avoid all such confrontation, and to hand down hisvalue system as unquestionable, is very striking. He points out that his‘postulate of objectivity’ is impossible to demonstrate, but he saysnevertheless that it is ‘consubstantial with science, and has guided the wholeof its prodigious development for three centuries’ and calls for ‘censorship’ topreserve its purity.3 [22_Notes.html#fn-c10_en3] Accordingly, he presents‘objective knowledge as the only source of real truth’.4[22_Notes.html#fn-c10_en4] So what sort of truth do we deal with in everydaylife, in personal relations or in the study of history? And since scientistsfrequently disagree and change their theories, which scientific truth are we toaccept? We would surely need some further explanation before we could make anysense of this claim. David Bohm reasonably remarks on theextreme dogmatism, shared by Monod and by the religious authorities, especiallyin earlier times, when religion played a dominant role in human affairs. Onecould indeed regard the postulate of objectivity as a paraphrase of formerarticles of religious faith which people were required to accept.… To carry theparallel further, it was supposed by the church that, if man is to be good, hemust ‘freely’ assent to God’s will (as interpreted by the religiousauthorities).… Both the religious authorities and Monod agree on the need for astrict ‘censorship’ of views contrary to what is right and good. They both talkin terms of ‘commandments’. In effect, Monod is proposing that objectivescientific knowledge should replace religion, not only as a source of knowledgeof the world, but also as a source of authority which determines the whole ofman’s being, even his innermost feelings and aspirations.5[22_Notes.html#fn-c10_en5]Understanding the Primacy of KnowledgeIf, then, we decide to set this dogmatism aside and question the special statusof science, do we find any special virtues attending the ideal of knowledge andgiving it a special status?There are in fact several, which exalters of the intellect from Plato on havecelebrated. They have shown, for instance, that knowledge of some kind or otheris needed in the pursuit of most other human ideals. Without it, the virtuestend to be blind and activities tend to be misdirected. But this is not adefence that Monod can use. Knowledge for him does not mean these various kindsof insight; it means physical science. Moreover, he, like Sartre, wants to writeoff all these other ideals as optional and dispensable, so that contributing tothem cannot be important.Alternatively, Plato and Aristotle gave knowledge a special status by arguingthat it was in the nature of the soul to reach out through contemplation tosomething greater than itself; knowledge simply was that contemplation. ButMonod does not believe that there is any such greater thing, nor that the soulhas a nature. And again, this still would not give the palm to the right kind ofknowledge. What he needs is an argument for the pre-eminence of physicalscience, not as part of a cluster of ideals, but as the one to which all therest should be subordinated. He carefully explains this, in case any of us stillfeel nostalgic for the others: ‘As for the highest human qualities, courage,altruism, generosity, creative ambition, the ethic of knowledge both recognizestheir sociobiological origin and affirms their transcendent value in the serviceof the ideal it defines.’ (my italics)6 [22_Notes.html#fn-c10_en6]No suitable argument supports this priority, and though Monod is probablyunaware of it, the claim is as arbitrary as any in the long history of moralfraudulence. Dressed up in this way to look like metaphysical and scientificreasoning, it becomes very pernicious. What sort of a world would that be, inwhich all the aims of science were attained, and no other aims were evenconsidered to have the slightest independent importance?The Drama of Parental CallousnessWeinberg, for his part, quite possibly does not mean seriously to endorseMonod’s crude subordination of all other human ideals to that of scientificknowledge. In general he is a scrupulous writer, very careful to control most ofthe dramas lurking in his subject. When he puts physics among ‘the very few’non-farcical human activities, he may not mean to narrow the range of these muchfurther than the rest of us would. But the language is strong, and takentogether with his remarks just before it does suggest melodrama. Two things, Ithink, are going wrong.First, there is the tone of personal aggrievement and disillusion, which seemsto depend, in both him and Monod, on failure to get rid of the animism orpersonification which they officially denounce. An inanimate universe cannot behostile. To call it that is to reproach it for not being the divine parent ofearlier belief. Only in a real, conscious human parent could uncaringness equalhostility. Weinberg’s mention of farce seems meant to imply the maliciouscallousness of such a parent, perhaps of one who leads a child on to expectaffection and then rejects it. Monod seems to express the same unreasonabledisappointment when he says that man lives ‘on the boundary of an alien world, aworld that is deaf to his music and as indifferent to his hopes as it is to hissufferings or his crimes’.7 [22_Notes.html#fn-c10_en7]Certainly if we expect the non-human world around us to respond to us as afriendly human would, we shall be disappointed. But this does not put it in theposition of a callously indifferent human. What we can rightly demand and getfrom the natural world around us is not this kind of social attention butsomething quite different – a setting of living things and creatures to which weare attuned, and to whose music we for our part are far from deaf. Because wecan get this, and do get it unless we treat the natural world too brutally, weare simply not in the position of the lonely, alien intruders pictured by Sartreand Monod. And because the natural world is not a person, neither is it an enemywhom we can heroically resist. The drama of Ajax defying the lightning fallsflat once we have demystified electric charges as modern physics tells us to.The second trouble concerns time and chance. For Weinberg, in the sadreflections noticed on p. 86, what reduces most of human life to farce is notjust the element of indeterminacy in particle physics but also the shortness ofour time-span. As he says there:It is almost irresistible for humans to believe that we have some specialrelation to the universe, that human life is not just a more-or-less farcicaloutcome of a chain of accidents reaching back to the first three minutes, butthat we were somehow built in from the beginning.… It is very hard to realisethat this all is just a tiny part of an overwhelmingly hostile universe. It iseven harder to realise that this present universe has evolved from anunspeakably unfamiliar early condition, and faces a future extinction of endlesscold or intolerable heat. The more the universe seems comprehensible, the moreit also seems pointless.8 [22_Notes.html#fn-c10_en8]The Casino FantasyWhat is there here that is genuinely alarming, and what is added drama? First,in what way does the ‘chain of accidents’ reduce human life to a ‘more or lessfarcical outcome’? Talk of accidents seems again to anthropomorphize andpersonalize. The word ‘accident’ is value-laden; it implies that someone slippedup. It suggests human carelessness intruding to spoil an ambitious design. Monodmakes a revealing comment:Immanence is alien to modern science. Destiny is written as and while, notbefore, it happens.… The universe was not pregnant with life nor the biospherewith man. Our number came up in the Monte Carlo game. Is it surprising that,like the person who has just made a million at the casino, we should feelstrange and a little unreal?9 [22_Notes.html#fn-c10_en9]This again is melodrama. A casino is a human institution, devised to servespecific human motives. ‘Chance’ in a casino context means the deliberaterandomizing of a small section of human affairs as a special way ofredistributing income. Gambling language is indeed often used for probabilitycalculations because gamblers have been so interested in them, and it can bequite harmless there. But this does not license Monod to import the specialmotivations which produce gambling, and conclude that the universe is reallyjust a vast casino.The idea of gambling cannot be used to convey meaninglessness. It is an ideapacked with meaning. The casino image is every bit as anthropomorphic as thefamiliar argument from design. God reappears as a sinister croupier, a presidentof the immortals deliberately refusing to organize things because it amuses himmore to let the wheel spin and generate farces. Biology, too, is strangelydistorted here. The biosphere certainly was pregnant with us, among its otherchildren, and the universe with life. It is quite anti-scientific to supposethat, in the development of life, sudden vast leaps like winning a million couldtake place.‘Immanence’ is of course a vague term, but some degree of suitability betweeneffects and causes is a necessary presupposition of all organized thinking, notonly of the sciences. ‘Chance’ in the sense in which it can be credited withcontributing to either life or the human race simply means ‘relatively remotecauses’. Ignorance of causes is the only proper sense for the term to bear inbiology, and in most other scientific contexts. In particle physics it mayindeed now have the stronger meaning of actual indeterminacy. But in no sciencecan it mean that slightly sinister and underhand deity worshipped by gamblers,Fortune on her wheel, whose presence is needed if we are to grow dramatic andtalk of farce. And it cannot show us as strangers, in the way in which thegambler is a stranger to his fortune.Two things make the situation of the Monte Carlo winner ‘strange and unreal’.His million is unearned, and it comes to him in one enormous, sudden dollop.(Even an earned million could be disturbing if it appeared unexpectedly all atonce like this.) Neither of these things is true of human life. The originalhuman evolutionary niche was gradually earned in exactly the same way as otherevolutionary niches – by ages of slow, patient adaptation, which fitted ourancestors to occupy it and ensured that it had plenty of meaning for them. (Ourlater raids on the evolutionary niches of others are of course a differentmatter, but then that is not what Monod is talking about.)Of course human beings did not earn their niche in the wild sense of entirelyinventing it by their own power. No organism needs or expects to do that. Theenvironment came to them from outside as a set of uncovenanted blessings anddifficulties; raw material to deal with. Their contribution was to adapt, bothgenetically and culturally, so as to deal with their circumstances. Their givenmaterial, moreover, included the natural limitations on their powers ofadapting.The element of chance in genetic mutation is simply a part of this background ofgiven capacities and incapacities. For human beings living their lives,everything in their natural constitution comes from outside anyway as luck, inthe sense that they did not make it, any more than they made the physicalconditions outside them. This kind of luck does not compromise theirindependence, because the notion of independence makes no sense except in aworld already containing given problems which one is to show independence insolving.The idea of a creature totally self-dependent is an empty one. Freedom can onlybe exercised against a wide background of constraints. As for luck or chance inthe further, quite different sense in which scientists, when they come to studythe matter, may find it if they conclude that a process is random andunpredictable for purposes of theory, that is an internal matter for science,without bearing on the meaning of life. Accordingly, neither the ‘geneticlottery’ nor quantum mechanics has any special significance for the way in whichwe should regard our lives.We have no need at all to follow Monod’s peculiar path of dramatizing boththese, first by concentrating on them to the exclusion of the much more numerousnon-random areas of science, which contribute a great deal to making our livesintelligible, and then by describing his chosen areas in the language of thecasino. That language invokes a third, much narrower notion of dependence on‘luck’ in which it means the deliberate parasitism of people who choose to liveby gambling rather than by earning their keep. Since this is the only sense ofluck in which any alternative exists to living by luck and accepting it, it isthe only sense which involves anything discreditable or degrading, and so theonly one which will give any sense to the notion of ‘farce’."},{"pageContent":" 11 Scientific Education and Human TransienceThe candle that is set up in us shines bright enough for all our purposes.John LockeLiving With a Crippled IntellectIt is not surprising, however, that Monod’s story has had so much success,especially among scientists. In its lively, existentially coloured package, itoffers a way of combining the general scepticism and acceptance of confusionabout moral questions which is widely professed today with a firm, savingexception for confidence in the value of science. This fits the world-pictureacquired by very many people in the course of a scientific education, aneducation which trains them in scientific thinking, and greatly exaggerates theprecision possible to it, while doing very little to teach them the ways ofthinking which they will need for other purposes – personal, political,psychological, historical, metaphysical and all the rest.Since these purposes are central to life and call for a great deal of thought,especially in changing times, those whose intellect has been cramped by thiskind of foot-binding process into a specialized use experience a very painfulsense of confusion when other issues come before them. The discrepancy betweentheir confident use of highly trained intelligence in their work and theirhelplessness on other issues threatens to tear them apart and attacks the rootsof their self-respect. (Scholars in general are of course to some extent subjectto this trouble, but the physical sciences tend to have a method and asubject-matter even more remote from everyday problems than the rest.)In this emergency, Monod appears with the balm of a metaphysical proof thattheir plight is inescapable. He declares that science is indeed the only fieldwhere thought is possible. Everything else must be left to choice: notreasonable choice, but choice in the Existentialist sense of a blind,inarticulate act of will. For those who may still hesitate, he stands ready witha bracing draught of dogmatic puritan morality to enforce this mortification ofthe intellect:Cold and austere, proposing no explanation but imposing an ascetic renunciationof all other spiritual fare, this idea could not allay anxiety; it aggravated itinstead. It claimed to sweep away at a stroke the tradition of a hundredthousand years… With nothing to recommend it but a certain puritan arrogance,how could such an idea be accepted? It was not; it still is not.1[22_Notes.html#fn-c11_en1]Nevertheless, he insists, it ought to be; heroes should take their cold bathwithout flinching. Only bad habits and the weakness of our flesh stand in theway. Flattered and impressed, his public is naturally inclined to think that itsduty has now become clear. The pangs felt by an intellect bound down anddistorted from its full natural use must be borne and disregarded as merelyaccidents of our mortal condition. Thought must be abstained from except in theonly place where it can be performed with perfect success and purity: thelaboratory. To carry them through this ordeal, scientists will always have thatstrong though not very nutritious stimulant, spiritual pride, grounded on theconviction of being the only human group that has any worthwhile occupation atall.It is interesting to contrast this embittered, querulous form of Stoicism withthe quieter, less pretentious Roman variety that is its ancestor. MarcusAurelius, for instance, thought it fairly important to be contented:Whether the world subsists by a fortuitous concourse of atoms, or an intelligentNature presides over it, let this be laid down as a maxim, that I am a part of awhole, governed by its own nature… I shall never be displeased with whatever isallotted me by that whole… Let us then employ properly this moment of timeallotted to us by fate, and leave the world contentedly, like a ripe olivedropping from its stalk, speaking well of the soil that produced it, and of thetree that bore it.2 [22_Notes.html#fn-c11_en2]This does not seem to be any more ‘animistic’ than Weinberg’s notion of ahostile universe, and it is certainly better biology than Monod’s suggestion ofan alien universe to which we do not really belong at all.A Matter of ScaleBy now, however, it should be clear how these unquestionably depressing thoughtshave come to replace the euphoria generated by the escalator model. It is all amatter of perspective. To the astrophysicist who stands right back from thebiological picture, any escalation of life, however prolonged, is a mere hiccup.All forecasts for humanity, even when they include extensions through geneticengineering and space travel, come to the same thing in the end. H. G. Wellsunderstood this clearly and stressed it in The Time Machine and elsewhere. Butin the excitement of twentieth-century technology it seems somehow to have beenlargely forgotten, and recent escalator fantasies have been developed withlittle regard to it.Once remembered, however, it is liable to puncture them completely. It does sobecause they depend so heavily on the pay-off pattern, the notion that the valueof anything lies in its consequences. Jam is always tomorrow, never today. If,then, we decide that jam will one day cease, the hope of all intervening days isat once destroyed and jam as such is proved never to have been anything but acruel illusion. Moreover science itself, which was regarded as the main sourceof faith in future jam, now deals the death-blow to all such hopes through aruling in astrophysics. Had the doctrine of continuous creation prevailed overthat of the big bang, things might, in some people’s view, have been different;there would still be hope for us. Others, however, will point out with Weinbergthat it would still be true that the universe existed for a very long timebefore us. They will also perhaps wonder whether descendants immeasurablydistant from us in time would be much comfort. Whichever way you look at it, ona cosmic scale we are very small.Living with EternityWhat, however, forces us to use either the cosmic scale or the exclusivepay-offpattern when we are looking for meaning? It may be true that, as Weinbergsays, ‘it is almost irresistible for humans to believe that we have some specialrelation to the universe’.3 [22_Notes.html#fn-c11_en3] But ideas about what thatrelation is vary greatly, and scarcely any can have been so ambitiouslycomplacent as those developed in the west in the last century.Many cultures before us have expected an end to the universe. The Norse expectedthat end in Ragnarok, and thought of the special relation of humans to it assimply a duty laid on them to help in that final battle, doing what they couldto stave off the ruin which would still finally engulf not only them, buteverything else that was good. Others indeed have expected, like the Stoics,that the destruction of the world would be followed by a new age and a newcycle. Indeed, astrophysics itself seems now to envisage this as onepossibility, involving an indefinite sequence of big bangs. But it is not at allclear what sort of identification this idea licenses with the age that is tofollow. It certainly cannot work through the survival of the human species, orthe continuation of any single activity known to us. Many cultures too, such asthe Hindus and the ancient Greeks, have seen the procession of the ages not asstatic but as steadily deteriorating. And to many, such as the Buddhists, hopedoes not lie in any reversal of this process, but within, in becoming free,through fuller understanding, from the wheel of being itself.These very varied beliefs, and others equally far from our own, have notprevented people from finding meaning in their lives. Indeed, many have insistedthat a full acceptance of the dark perspectives around us is absolutelynecessary if one is even to start on an effective search for that meaning.The problem of evil is not an accidental difficulty for religion; it is thestarting-point from which the search that sometimes leads to religion begins.This realization of evil starts, of course, not at the cosmic end but fromindividual death and disaster. And the forecasts just mentioned are not reallymeant as scientific predictions, but as symbolic descriptions of how the worldworks and what we ought to expect from it. Weinberg, however, is surely makingjust that same use of his own forecast in the passage quoted. The fact that hisforecast is actually a scientific one does not prevent this. But it does tend toconfuse us about the kind of authority which his words carry. For those of uswho know nothing about astrophysics, Weinberg and his sources are authoritiesabout that. There we ought to believe them. But this does not give them anyauthority at all on the choice of suitable symbols for human destiny. Here theirstories must stand on their own merits as myths. No special standing attacheseither to the casino story or to the choice of a particular time-span.In what sense is the human course a short one? Length is always relative. Humanlife is short compared with the life of planets and galaxies, long compared withthat of fruit-flies and lightning flashes. Standards of comparison have to bechosen for their relevance to particular purposes. Weinberg’s choice of a verylong span is useful enough in correcting the escalator model. That correction,however, should not make him rebound from wild euphoria to equally wilddepression. The reason for this reaction is that he has chosen anotherperspective which is just as unsuitable as the first for direct application tohuman purposes.It is true that notions like meaning and purpose find no application in thefirst three cosmic minutes, or across uncounted ages, or in the movement ofparticles, or in the collapse of the galaxies, or at the surface of Betelgeuse,or indeed for most of the time at our own North Pole, because these notions onlymake sense in relation to organisms of a certain degree of complexity. I amdeliberately not touching on divine purposes in this discussion, so as to keepthings simple and to meet Monod and Weinberg on their own non-religious ground.But even if we brought divine purposes in, we should probably have to say thattheir relation to these inorganic goings on was mysterious to us. Teleologicalthinking simply does not help us in these fields, as it does in biology andabove all in human affairs. But since these are anyway not the fields in whichwe live, or in which the purposes of any living things are deployed, they couldnot be the right place to look for that meaning which must consist essentiallyin a pattern related to such purposes.Back to EarthIf we drop our surprising ambition to figure as central actors on the cosmicstage, and return to our own field of terrestrial life, we shall find noshortage of purposes, many of them very demanding. We shall probably see theproblem of meaning as chiefly one of harmonizing these purposes, and ofunderstanding them well enough not to waste our lives on shadows.Among these purposes, those concerned with knowledge will indeed appear asimportant, and the sciences, physical and otherwise, as very serious fields ofhuman endeavour. But the idea that they, or any narrow group of them, couldfurnish the whole purpose of human life will probably strike us as extremelystrange. Since its effect is to tear the human faculties apart, divorcingintellect from feeling, spirit, action and bodily perception, it denies even tointellect itself most of the scope which it should naturally have. Theanthropologist Colin Turn-bull draws attention to the strange way in which oureducational system, unlike many others, systematically divides the humanfaculties by educating each on its own and avoiding problems of integration. Hepoints out:the need for all of us, whatever we are doing, to do it with the whole of ourbeing and not just as an intellectual exercise or just to accomplish somephysical or mechanical goal… Good mechanics, like good craftsmen in any walk oflife, put pride into their work, doing it with their whole being, with concernfor others with whom, through their work, they are in contact.4[22_Notes.html#fn-c11_en4]Occupations, scientific or otherwise, treated in this way need not, as he pointsout, either divide up an individual’s own nature or split him off from thosearound him in the competitive isolation which is so frequent a feature ofwestern education. They can help him instead to integrate all his powers in abalanced fulfilment – an aim which is, as he points out, amazingly absent fromthe theory and practice of our schooling, and especially from the current idealof a scientist.Only in the last few decades has that ideal even begun to acquire an activecomponent, as the notion of social responsibility has gradually, and againstmuch opposition, begun to be grafted again on to the official concept ofscience. But to give play for that active component, scientists have, likeEinstein, to see themselves as not only scientists, but responsible men andwomen whose business it is to weigh together whole ranges of human aims, amongwhich the aims of the various sciences form only a part. Specialization mustoften be resisted, and thought on general subjects positively encouraged. Thereis no standing at all for the dogmatic idea that science can simply be treatedas the only important activity, having won the race with all other human aims ina walkover.The really startling thing about this idea, in the forms in which it is now putforward, is its unthinkingness. When people like H. G. Wells, and occasionallyT. H. Huxley, used to make this kind of suggestion, they knew that it neededhard argument of the most varied kinds to support it. They saw the moral,political, psychological, logical and metaphysical difficulties, as well as anumber of straight biological ones, and tried to meet each set strenuously inits own appropriate style.The heirs of this enterprise, by contrast, sitting comfortably on the statuswhich has been provided for them, tend not to find any argument necessary. Forthem, this picture is the only possible one. The habitual conviction of theall-sufficiency of science looks to them like something, not just obvious, butitself scientifically established. It looks, in fact, as we have seen, like apart of the theory of evolution. It also serves them, however, as a religion inthat it tells them what to venerate, indicating the supreme values available andjustifying the sacrifice of all others to them. Since its basis is in fact notscientific at all but merely imaginative, it seems to be a fair question whetherthis faith should not be viewed simply as one religion among the othersavailable. The reason why this now looks startling is because today science andreligion are still often seen as in some sense polar opposites. It will help us,I think, to look carefully at the meaning of this opposition, and of some othersrelated to it, in the next chapter."},{"pageContent":" 12 Mixed AntithesesSomething I owe to the soil that grew – More to the life that fed –But most to Allah Who gave me two Separate sides to my head.I would go without shirt or shoes Friends, tobacco or breadSooner than for an instant lose Either side of my head.Rudyard Kipling, Kim, Chapter VIIIBalancing the WorldI have been arguing that the contrast between science and religion is unluckilynot as plain, nor the relation between them as simple, as is often supposed, andhave been discussing some elements which can equally form part of either.Thoughtful scientists have often mentioned this problem, but a great many oftheir colleagues, and of the public generally, cling to the reassuringly simpleopposition. What often seems to happen is that a great number of differentantitheses are mixed up here, and used rather indiscriminately, as each happensto be convenient, to give colour to the idea of a general crusade of lightagainst darkness. We could group them roughly like this:[images/c12-utbl1.jpg]Shifting ParadigmsA mental map based on this strange group of antitheses, a map which showed themall as roughly equivalent and was marked only with the general direction ‘keepto the left’, has for the last century usually been issued to English-speakingscientists with their first test-tube and has often gone with them to the grave.In spite of its wild incoherence, it still has great influence, though at leasttwo recent developments within science itself have lately shaken it, and moreare to be expected.The first shock is the series of changes whereby modern physics now showsindeterminacy as lying near the centre of causation, and solid matter asdissolving, on inspection, into nonsolid energy. This is a severe upset to thecrucial notions of mechanism and determinism. What perhaps cuts deepest,however, is something symbolic which looks more superficial and which would notmatter at all if people were really only interested in facts and not in drama.It is the disturbance to the notion of ‘hardness’, a metaphor whose applicationis entirely mysterious, but which has somehow served to keep the whole left-handcolumn together.At present, this change results in a flow of popular books such as The Tao ofPhysics by Fritdjof Capra and The Dancing Wu Li Masters by Gary Zukav,1[22_Notes.html#fn-c12_en1] which suggest that energy is spirit, and that whatmodern physics teaches is, give or take a mantra or two, very much what Zenmasters and Hindu sages have been saying for centuries, or possibly millennia.Whatever else may be thought about this, it does at least point to the need tolook again at our list of antitheses. On the face of things, these books do drawattention to the arbitrary narrowmindedness which has been imposed onscientists, and call for science to look outward, though at times they also seemto convey the opposite message: science, especially physics, is already far morespiritual, and therefore more all-sufficient, than we have so far supposed. Atleast, however, the traditional set of antitheses is broken up. Seriousphysicists seem at present more aware than many biologists of its confusions andinadequacies. David Bohm’s comment, extracts from which we saw earlier, deservesnow to be quoted more fully:At the end of the nineteenth century, physicists widely believed that classicalphysics gave the general outlines of a complete mechanical explanation of theuniverse. Since then, relativity and quantum theory have overturned such notionsaltogether. It is now clear that no mechanical explanation is available, not forthe fundamental particles which constitute all matter, inanimate and animate,nor for the cosmos as a whole (e.g. it is now widely accepted among cosmologiststhat in ‘black holes’ there is a singularity, near which all customary notionsof causally ordered law break down). So we are now in the strange position thatwhereas physicists are implying that, fundamentally and in its totality,inanimate matter is not mechanical, molecular biologists are saying thatwhenever matter is organized so as to be alive, it is completely mechanical.Of course, molecular biologists generally ignore the implications of physics,except when these implications support their own position. In this connection,it might be appropriate for them to consider that the nineteenth-century view ofphysics was enormously more comprehensively and accurately tested than is nowpossible for the current views of molecular biology. Despite this, classicalphysics was swept aside and overturned, being retained only as a simplificationand an approximation valid in a certain limited domain. Is it not likely thatmodern molecular biology will sooner or later undergo a similar fate?What is needed for unrestricted objectivity is a certain tentative andexploratory quality of mind that is free of final conclusions. [Without this,there is an] ever-present danger that knowledge in broad and deep fields maygive rise to the sort of ‘hubris’ described above, in which there is anunquestioned belief in the complete validity of current forms of thinking…If[this] is allowed to continue in science, this latter will in all probabilityeventually suffer the sort of decline of influence which has already befallenthe religious view of the world. Indeed, there are already signs of such atrend.2 [22_Notes.html#fn-c12_en2]The second shock was delivered by recent discoveries about the functions ofbrain hemispheres. In its early days, this was often read, in a way which isitself a notable indicator of the underlying dramas expected, as a story aboutthe ‘dominance’ of one hemisphere, namely of course the calculating, articulate,scientific one, over the other, which was intuitive, humble and not really verydistinctively human.Further research, however, has steadily shown more and more serious functionsfor the right-hand hemisphere, and has led increasingly to the acceptance ofKipling’s picture expressed at the beginning of this chapter, where it isutterly vital to have, and to keep in balance, the two separate sides of one’shead. The idea of the ruling hemisphere had been just one more version of asimple but very powerful hierarchical view of mental function which longdominated neurology, and which Peter Reynolds, the comparative ethologist, haslately christened ‘the Victorian brain’.3 [22_Notes.html#fn-c12_en3]This showed brain evolution dramatically as a series of successive conquests, inwhich at each level of life a new brain area and its faculties came in to rulethe rest, culminating in man and the final victory of the cerebral cortex, orsome specially splendid part of it. To keep this dominance order clear,functions were neatly confined to particular structures, and the belief thathomo sapiens possessed not just a better cortex but entirely distinct organs tocarry his higher faculties was at first hotly defended by Owen against Huxley.Detailed neurological work has, however, worn away almost every aspect of thisseductive picture. As Stephen Walker, a neurological psychologist, says,One still has a sense of regret that this charming and convincing tale must bediscarded. The weight of evidence is now if anything more in favour of theunhelpful suggestion … that all the fundamental parts of the vertebrate brainwere present very early on, and can be observed in lampreys.4[22_Notes.html#fn-c12_en4]Moreover, new developments do not at all follow the simple pattern of conquestand takeover. Functions are neither handed over wholesale to grander organs norfully determined by them; they seem to involve very complex interactions betweenwide ranges of brain areas, in which it is seldom safe to say either that anyone area takes no part, or that any one dominates or ‘rules’ any others. Nodoubt each makes its own distinctive contribution, to which adjectives like‘higher’ might sometimes usefully be applied, but the only social metaphor whichseems appropriate for these transactions is co-operation. The brain, in short,works as a whole, and our understanding of it has been very much held back bythe fact that, as Walker remarks, ‘there is a tendency to want to appoint somebrain division as “in charge” of all the others, and this sets the stage forphylogenetic takeovers of the executive position’.Brain evolution, in short, is not a simple success story establishing the rightof all left-hand members in our antitheses to subdue their partners. Since themembers of the two sets are in any case such a mixed lot as to make thiswholesale arrangement impossible, we had better look at them separately on theirmerits.Finding the Right EnemyWhich among these antitheses are really the ones we need, which of them giveclear ground for a crusade?The ones in the first group seem the most promising for crusaders. In themscience stands opposed to something undoubtedly bad. But in these cases it iscertainly not the only opponent of the evils in question. Superstition and therest find their opposites in clear thinking generally, and a particularsuperstition is as likely to be corrected by history or logic or common sense asby one of the physical sciences.The second group deals in ideas which are more ambitious, more interesting, butalso much more puzzling, because we at once need definitions of the termsinvolved, and cannot easily give them without falling into confusion. The oddtendency of both rationalism and common sense to jump the central barrier isonly one indication of the difficulties.In the third group, we have contrasts which are a good deal clearer. But they donot seem to provide material at all suitable for a crusade. They describe pairsof complementary elements in life and thought, both members of which are equallynecessary, and indeed could scarcely be identified except in relation to eachother as parts of a whole. We no longer want that truculent little ‘v.’ todivide them. They go very well together, and crusaders must avoid trying to setthem at loggerheads. Thus it does not matter here that ‘reason’ appears on bothsides; we no longer want to reduce all these contrasts to a single underlyingshape. The lines of division cross each other. Different distinctions are neededfor different purposes.How hard it is to relate these various antitheses clearly can be seen inBertrand Russell’s very interesting and influential paper ‘Mysticism and logic’.Russell’s main enterprise here is an admirable attempt to move the whole debateinto our group 3, to show apparently warring elements as both necessary andcomplementary:Metaphysics, or the attempt to conceive the world as a whole by means ofthought, has been developed, from the first, by the union and conflict of twovery different human impulses, the one urging men towards mysticism, the otherurging them towards science… . In Hume, for instance, the scientific impulsereigns quite unchecked, while in Blake a strong hostility to science co-existswith profound mystic insight. But the greatest men who have been philosophershave felt the need both of science and of mysticism; the attempt to harmonizethe two was what made their life, and what always must, for all its arduousuncertainty, make philosophy, to some minds, a greater thing than either scienceor religion… Mysticism, is, in essence, little more than a certain intensity anddepth of feeling in regard to what is believed about the universe… Mysticism isto be commended as an attitude towards life, not as a creed about the world. Themetaphysical creed, I shall maintain, is a mistaken outcome of the emotion,although this emotion, as colouring all other thoughts and feelings, is theinspirer of whatever is best in Man. Even the cautious and patient investigationof truth by science, which seems the very antithesis of the mystic’s swiftcertainty, may be fostered and nourished by that very spirit of reverence inwhich mysticism lives and moves.5 [22_Notes.html#fn-c12_en5]Russell has got a lot of things right here. He has ‘got in’, as they say, manyitems from the right-hand column of our antitheses in legitimate relation toscience. He has got in emotion and poetry, indeed he has got in Blake, with hiscriticisms of Newton. He sees that emotion is so far from being an opponent ofscience, or a menace to it, that emotion of a suitable kind is necessary forscience, and that part of that emotion can quite properly be called ‘reverence’.He sees that something of the sort is necessary for metaphysics too.The word metaphysics here is not of course used in the abusive sense to meanmere empty vapouring. It is used in its proper sense of very general conceptualenquiry, covering such central topics as the relation of mind and matter, freewill and necessity, meaning, truth and the possibility of knowledge, all in anattempt (as Russell rightly says) to make sense of the world as a whole. In thissense, naturally, views like materialism and empiricism, and also scepticalenquiries like those of Hume, Ayer and Popper are themselves part of metaphysicsjust as much as what they oppose or enquire into. When A. J. Ayer began his bookLanguage, Truth and Logic6 [22_Notes.html#fn-c12_en6] with a chapter called ‘Theelimination of metaphysics’, and went on to explain that the word was for himvirtually equivalent to ‘nonsense’, he was, in any ordinary sense of that word,simply doing metaphysics himself – expounding one theory of meaning among manyothers. Empty vapouring is bad metaphysics. there is a lot of it about, but itcannot make the study unnecessary.Russell, who had the advantage of having started his philosophical life as adisciple of Hegel, was not tempted, as Hume and his disciples were, to supposethat good metaphysics merely meant cutting down one’s thoughts on such topics toa minimum. He knew that, far from that, even highly constructive metaphysicianslike Plato and Heraclitus, Leibnitz and Hegel often had something very importantto say, especially about mathematics. Yet he was now a convert to empiricism,and he wanted to set limits on the thought-architecture of these boldrationalists. His solution was, on the whole, to concentrate on the emotionalfunction of this large-scale, constructive metaphysics, and on the intellectualfunction of science and of more sceptical philosophy. Thus mystical,constructive metaphysics was to supply the heart of the world-graspingenterprise, while science supplied the head.The Many-Sidedness of ScienceThis is a bold and ingenious idea, but something has gone wrong with it. He hasfitted the head of one kind of enquiry on to the heart of another. Constructivemetaphysics has its own thoughts, and science its own motives. If the wordscience means what it seems to mean here – primarily the search for particularfacts – then it is powered emotionally by the familiar motive of detailedcuriosity. If it means the building of those facts into a harmonious, satisfyingsystem, then it draws upon a different motive, the desire for intellectualorder; which is also the motive for metaphysical endeavour. Without thisunifying urge, science would be nothing but mindless, meaningless collecting. Atthe quite ordinary scientific level, before any question of mysticallycontemplating the whole comes in, the system-building tendency, with itsaesthetic criteria of elegance and order, is an essential part of every science,continually shaping the scrappy data into usable patterns. Scientific hypothesesare not generated by randomizers, nor do they grow on trees, but on the branchesof these ever-expanding thought systems.This is why the sciences continually go beyond everybody’s direct experience,and do so in directions that quickly diverge from that of common sense, whichhas more modest systems of its own. And because isolated systems are alwaysincomplete and can conflict with each other, inevitably in the end they requiremetaphysics, ‘the attempt to conceive the world as a whole’, to harmonize them.To what are interestingly called lay people, however, these intellectualconstructions present problems of belief which are often quite as difficult asthose of religion, and which can call for equally strenuous efforts of faith.This happens at present over relativity, over the size and expansion of theuniverse, over quantum mechanics, over evolution and many other matters.Believers are – perhaps quite properly – expected to bow to the mystery, admitthe inadequacy of their faculties, and accept paradoxes. If a mystical sense ofreverence is, as Russell suggested, the right response to the vast andincomprehensible universe, then science itself requires it, since it leads us ondirectly to this situation. It cannot therefore be right to call mysticism andscience, as Russell does, two distinct, co-ordinate ‘human impulses’. Mysticismis a range of human faculties; physical science, a range of enquiries which can,at times, call these faculties into action. But long before it does so, it haspassed the limits of common sense, transcended experience and begun to ask forfaith.At this stage, there is often a real problem about what kind of thinking isgoing on, and whether it ought to be stopped. If, for instance, we ask whetherthe universe is finite, are we still talking about anything at all? If so, do weknow what it is? The most general concepts used by any science – concepts likelife, time, space, law, energy – raise serious headaches, affecting their use inactual problems. To resolve these, however, we often need not more facts but abetter way of fitting these concepts into their neighbours, of stating the widerproblems which surround them, of ‘conceiving the world as a whole’. Sciencequite properly calls on the whole range of our cognitive faculties, but it isnot alone in doing so, nor can it define their whole aim. It is a part of ourattempt to understand the universe, not the whole of it. It opens intometaphysics."},{"pageContent":" 13 Science, Scepticism and AweI do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have beenonly a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and thenfinding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the greatocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.Isaac NewtonScience as a Part of LifeWhere does this glance at Russell’s diagnosis take us? We have been trying tobring some order into the chaotic mix of antitheses from which we started, usingfirst the approach which Russell suggests. This approach gives us somelegitimate footing for the emotional elements on the right-hand of our columns,but not yet for the cognitive ones. It shows emotion, reverence, poetry and thesense of mystery, not as opponents of science, but as at least its equals,elements just as necessary for a balanced intellectual life, and perhaps morenecessary for life as a whole. In view of the remarks about Blake, this willalso give a standing to the humanities, not as illicit, upstart competitors withscience, but as its distinct and equal colleagues. It gives a possibility offitting science realistically into the rest of life, reminding us what otherparts that life must have. (Russell did not greatly stress this reminder becausein his day the boot was still on the other foot; humanists were the ones whoneeded reminding of the importance of science. No doubt they often still do. Buttheir resolute blindness is now more than equalled by that of their opponents.)What Russell does not manage to do is to find an adequate place for thewandering cognitive elements which appear in the right-hand columns, notablyrationalism, common sense and metaphysics. He seems inclined to count everythingcognitive except philosophy as science. This neglects not only such disciplinesas history, but also certain important contrasts which should really appear onthe left-hand side of the barrier – differences within our cognitive facultiesthemselves, which make the notion of science a very complex one.Russell writes here as if there were no difference between the various sciences,and as if science, common sense and experience were virtually the same thing – akind of downright everyday truthfulness about the facts, straightforwardlyopposed to the extravagant Hegelian metaphysics which flows from treatingmystical emotion as a source of knowledge. Yet in his earlier book The Problemsof Philosophy he had pointed out the gulf between them.1[22_Notes.html#fn-c13_en1] Our commonsense beliefs go far beyond our ownindividual experience, and are often at odds with it. And the fully developedsciences tell a quite different story from both. Much hard conceptual plumbingis needed if we are to connect them all in any sort of a watertight manner.Russell’s mention of Hume here as someone in whom ‘the scientific impulse reignsquite unchecked’ shows strikingly how far he had for the moment forgotten thiskind of difficulty. Hume was no less deeply sceptical about physical sciencethan he was about every other intellectual enterprise. Because he was sodetermined an empiricist, so resolute to accept nothing except individualexperience, he thought the idea of causal necessity and the regularity of natureextremely fishy, and sharply criticized his predecessor Locke’s credulity aboutit. ‘If we believe that fire warms, or water refreshes, it is only because itcosts us too much pains to think otherwise.’2 [22_Notes.html#fn-c13_en2] Britishempiricism did not move from this sceptical position towards any real acceptanceof modern science until Mill wrote his Logic. This still left furtherdifficulties, which Russell himself did a great deal to remove. But there is aformidable pile of them left today, providing work for anyone (scientist orphilosopher) who wants to understand what the sciences are really doing, and tosee how to deal with their conflicts.Within the notion of science itself there are large, unresolved clashes, notablybetween the idea that it is simply a vast memory store, a register of facts, andthe quite different one that it is an intellectual system constructed byreasoning as a means to understanding the universe. These problems are of courseno discredit to science. But they are a real obstacle to inscribing its name ona banner as a simple sign to fight under.On Having Faith in ReasonThese divisions bring us to another key case, rationalism. This means confidencein reason; people’s attitude to it naturally depends on what reason is supposedto be opposing at the time. When the opposite is superstition or some othermember of our first right-hand column, there is no problem; all intellectualsare supposed to be united against it. But there is also the much less simplesituation in which reason is opposed to experience – where people’s perceptionsseem not to accord with what they believe must be true, as for instance over thesize of the stars or the shape of the earth or the solidity of matter. Scienceis by no means always on the side of experience here, as is plain from theseexamples, and still plainer when unexpected results are dismissed asexperimental error, or in cases like parapsychology where scientists unite torefuse to look at certain groups of data at all. This may be perfectlyreasonable. But the point we have to notice about it here is the strong faithwhich it testifies in a general, theoretical, a priori view of the universe.Perhaps some such faith is an intellectual necessity. In that case, theimportant thing seems to be not to take it for granted, but to be conscious ofit, to distinguish its various elements, and to see on what grounds we canchoose between them when there are alternatives. Moderate rationalism – acertain degree of confidence in reasoning against experience – can be perfectlyrational. It need not commit us, as the stronger rationalism of Plato and Hegeldoes, to regarding the world of experience as in any way unreal or delusive. Butwhat it does mean is that we cannot defend our theories by treating them simplyas if they were matters of direct experience. They depend also on faith, on achoice about how to regard the universe. It must follow, again, that faith isnot just something to be got rid of, but something to be rightly directed.Sceptical DifficultiesThis may worry some readers. Have we really a right to trust our faculties andassume that the universe they show us is as a whole lawful and regular enough toallow reason to be used on it? Yes, we surely do. Philosophical sceptics, ifthey really urge us to drop this bad habit of faith, are still relying on thesefaculties, but using them for an illicit kind of moral blackmail. They trade onthe moral prestige which rightly belongs to selective, discriminatingscepticism, to care and caution in distinguishing good from bad grounds forbelief. This moral prestige cannot be extended to the undiscriminating,universal kind, which would stop us drawing any such distinctions at all.Sometimes, of course, philosophical sceptics are only talking about rules forthe convenient use of words, as when they deliberately narrow the use of termslike ‘knowledge’. And this kind of modest move can be useful. But something farmore ambitious than this is happening when they put on their own drama, thedrama which is played for all it will pull in the concluding chapter to thefirst volume of Hume’s Treatise. Here the sceptical hero stands exalted asOdysseus, the only man strong enough to resist the siren-song of normal evidenceand know that belief is never really justified. (He doesn’t actually disbelieve,but he knows that he only believes because it would cost him too much pains todo otherwise. Others stop their ears; they will not accept this painful truth.)This scene draws its moral force from its resemblance to one where someparticular false proposition is presented for acceptance, perhaps enforced bythreats, for instance in the trial of Galileo. Nothing of this kind is actuallyhappening over these attempts to question in some vast and general way theentire practice of belief. What is going on is either just a modest negotiationabout the convenient use of concepts – which would call for no special heroism –or it is a demonstration in support of a particular moral position, namely, thatincredulousness is in itself a virtue and credulity a vice. It is always moreblessed to disbelieve than to believe.The colours which Hume slaps on here make it impossible to suppose that he isonly engaged in a quiet bit of conceptual plumbing. His moral indignation andalarm are evident. And they are quite in place if they are understood – as inpractice they mostly are – as calling for selective scepticism, for a readinessto question unexamined dogmas. But if this is inflated into genuinelyundiscriminating disbelief, questions can have no answers, and the act ofquestioning itself becomes fraudulent and meaningless.The reader will notice that I see this as one more situation where the essentialthing is to spot the drama, grasp its meaning and disentangle it from the realargument. Monomania on my part is one possible explanation, but another is thatthere is something in what I say. This kind of thing does, I suspect, flourishparticularly easily in the work of writers who are letting it be known that theyare particularly down-to-earth, unconventional and non-religious. Drama is aslikely to be present in them as in any other kind of writer, and is, as I havesaid, in itself perfectly legitimate. But it will not be so easily noticed andallowed for as it is where the work is known to be imaginative and metaphysical.Hume’s work shows this, and also another feature which seems to be common,namely the use of a drama which was suitable in his own day, but becomes less solater, yet still continues to play to full houses under its own emotional steam.In Hume’s time, professed, chronic unbelievers (especially in religion) wererare. The vices endemic to professed, chronic believers, such as complacency,lazy-mindedness and easy shockability, were dominant. When, however, unbelieversbegan to grow more common, they in their turn naturally revealed their owncharacteristic vices, such as arrogance, perversity and self-dramatization. Atfirst, no doubt, it is a gain to counter the vices typical of age with those ofyouth. But later this stops being half so obviously true, and to settle thebalance would call for a direct moral argument. It cannot be done in Hume’s way,as a spin-off from a very abstract metaphysical enquiry. Moreover, oncedisbelief itself becomes fashionable, one can get the benefit of both sets ofvices together, not only in the same epoch but in the same person.Narrow-minded, conformist sceptics and immoralists are now a standard issue.Both sets of vices are equally distracting and dangerous. There is, I suggest,no possibility of properly calling either credulity or incredulity in themselvesgood or bad. There is no short cut; we need to believe and disbelieve the rightthings. Since disbelief, as much as belief, is a positive, chosen attitude,parsimony cannot settle the matter. Neither belief nor disbelief can be boughtwholesale, as a general policy. We simply have to assess particular propositionson their merits.A much more limited kind of scepticism, which was particularly important toRussell, is logical atomism. This is the view that all truths are particulartruths. Out of these, general theories may be constructed, but quite generalprepositions about the universe as a whole are vacuous. Thus Russell, reactingsharply against the bold Hegelian view that the universe was essentially one,ruled (with equal boldness) that the very notion of a universe was an illicitone:I believe that conception of ‘the universe’ to be, as its etymology indicates, amere relic of pre-Copernican astronomy. … The apparent oneness of the world isan undiscussed postulate of most metaphysics … [but really] the apparent onenessof the world is merely the oneness of what is seen by a single spectator orapprehended by a single mind.3 [22_Notes.html#fn-c13_en3]This principle would veto all talk about the universe as a whole, and preventour expressing any general view of it, such as a confidence that it is regular.Logical atomism is, in fact, a specialized form of scepticism, but it is one towhich we need not bow, for it rests on a confusion. The particular propositionswhich it treats as ultimate could not have been formed without the framework ofwider conceptual schemes which serves as their background and provides theirterms. As Wittgenstein saw, particular propositions cannot always be prior togeneral ones. Both are elements in language, which is itself an element in ourwhole system of behaviour.4 [22_Notes.html#fn-c13_en4] In a crucial sense, thewhole is always prior to its parts. And unquestionably this kind of belief in alaw-abiding universe – which is a real belief, not just a policy – is aprecondition of any possible physical science.Awe, Reverence and MysteryIn what spirit, then, is it rational for a scientist to confront the universe inwhich he has this kind of confidence? Julian Huxley, the thoughtful zoologistwho was Thomas Henry’s grandson, answered without hesitation that this spiritwas bound to be a religious one, simply because of the situation of our speciesas a tiny part of it. In man, he says,for the first time life becomes aware of something more than a set of events; itbecomes aware of a system of powers operating in events… . Man frames his ownidea of these powers… . We call it religious when on the one hand it involvessome recognition of powers operating so as to underlie the general operation ofthe world, and, on the other hand, when it involves the emotions.5[22_Notes.html#fn-c13_en5]In such a relation, awe and reverence are (he insists) entirely appropriateemotions, and an investigator who lacks them will make a bad scientist. Russell– of course no less atheistic – made a similar remark, though he did not use theword ‘religion’ so widely:In religion, and in every deeply serious view of the world and of human destiny,there is an element of submission, a realization of the limits of human power,which is somewhat lacking in the modern world, with its quick materialsuccesses, and its insolent belief in the boundless possibilities of progress.‘He that loveth his life shall lose it’, and there is danger lest, through a tooconfident love of life, life itself should lose much of what gives it itshighest worth. The submission which religion inculcates in action is essentiallythe same in spirit as that which science teaches in thought.6[22_Notes.html#fn-c13_en6]Similarly Dobzhansky:Rejecting vitalism in no way conflicts with what Albert Schweitzer has called‘reverence for life’. Man’s conscience, the existence of life, and indeed of theuniverse itself, all are parts of the mysterium tremendum… . There is no moresuccinct, and at the same time accurate, statement of the distinctive quality ofhuman nature than that of Dostoevsky; ‘Man needs the unfathomable and theinfinite just as much as he does the small planet which he inhabits’… . In everyknown human society … peoples have arrived at some system of religious viewsconcerning the meaning and the proper conduct of their lives… . Religion enableshuman beings to make peace with themselves and with the formidable andmysterious universe into which they are flung by some power greater thanthemselves.7 [22_Notes.html#fn-c13_en7]This attitude owes a good deal to the fact that Dobzhansky, like Einstein andNewton, is the kind of scientist who emphasizes the inevitable slightness of thewhole scientific achievement and its absurd dis-proportion to the vastness ofwhat there is to be known, rather than the kind who claims (like Wilson) thatthe job is nearly finished, or that, as Francis Crick puts it,While a scientist is sobered by the economic and political problems he sees allaround him, he is possessed of an almost boundless optimism concerning hisability to forge a wholly new set of beliefs, solidly based on both theory andexperiment, by a careful study of the world around him and, ultimately, ofhimself and other human beings… . The feeling is that within a few generationswe shall have got to the heart of the matter. (my italics)8[22_Notes.html#fn-c13_en8]The matter in question is ‘the intricacies of the brain’ and its relation to themind. But Crick is equally cheerful about the whole mind–body problem and a widerange of questions which surround it including ‘major efforts to improve thenature of man himself’.9 [22_Notes.html#fn-c13_en9] Readers will inevitably tendto divide themselves here into those who think that the difference between thesetwo groups of scientists is due to the startling scientific progress made in thedecade or two between their times of writing, and those who explain it, moresimply, by a sharp decline in the quality of scientific education. The point Iam currently making about the idea of ‘the universe’ as a whole is that, if onemeans by it not much more than is already described in scientific books, one isless likely to be deeply impressed with its vastness and mystery than if oneregards those books as small mirrors reflecting only parts of its moresuperficial aspects.Is it in order for Dobzhansky and Huxley to describe their world-view asreligious, or even as a religion? It is obviously not a religion in the fullsense, if that is taken to mean that a recruit can put it down in theappropriate column of his army form and expect suitable provision for worship.But, as I suggested at the outset, some of the elements combined in Christianityand its more familiar alternatives seem to be dispersing, and many otherreligions never combined them all in the first place. In their original forms,Buddhism had no god and Judaism no doctrine of immortality. Stoicism, which alsolacked both and had no ritual either, clearly served most of the functions of areligion for its followers. So does Marxism, which has a good deal in commonwith the evolutionist faith.William James, in some thoughtful remarks about the outer limits of the term,concluded that an attitude could usefully be called religious so long as it wasone directed to the world as a whole, ‘about which there is something solemn,serious and tender’.10 [22_Notes.html#fn-c13_en10] It must also be an attitudeof acceptance, not rejection, and an acceptance which is not grudging butenthusiastic. This acceptance rests on ‘belief that there is an unseen order’,and flows from ‘that fundamental mystery of religious experience, thesatisfaction found in absolute surrender to the larger power’, a surrender whichof course is not just masochistic, but based on the sense that all things worktogether for good.Because this kind of attitude has had such a bad press in western thought sincethe eighteenth century, James has to spend a great deal of his book pointing outthat it will not do for empiricists, of all people, to dismiss so potent anelement in life unexamined. Empiricism, he says, demands that we look at a rangeof experience seriously and open-mindedly, and consider what is the best way todescribe it, not that we define it in advance in ways designed to outlawalternative descriptions, or forms of it which we find inconvenient.Two Ways of Exalting EvolutionIn this book I have of course not tried to duplicate James’s work, but aparticular aspect of it is of great interest here, namely the path by whichscientists, merely by being scientists, can find themselves using and resting inan attitude which is in a plain sense religious. The intellectual attitudenecessary for science, if given its full scope and not reduced artificially to amere mindless tic for collecting, is continuous with a typically religious viewof the physical world. This is one of the varieties of religious experience. Thesense of a sharp opposition here is misleading.When this fact is noticed, however, very fishy conclusions are sometimes drawnfrom it, which tend to produce the bizarre and sometimes monstrous prophecies wehave seen. Scientists who see that they are in some sense neighbours of religionare sometimes moved, not to an exploration of relations and shared interests,but to the hope of loot and plunder. Julian Huxley often notes with exasperationthat orthodox religion, of a kind which he himself finds pointless, seems stillto retain its force, while science, even when believed, has much less influence.He wants a transfer of spiritual assets. Edward O. Wilson, noting the samephenomenon, wastes no time complaining but spits on his palms to set the matterright:The time has come to ask: Does a way exist to divert the power of religion intothe service of the great new enterprise that lays bare the sources of thatpower? … Make no mistake about the power of scientific materialism. It presentsthe human mind with an alternative mythology that until now has always, pointfor point in zones of conflict, defeated traditional religion. Its narrativeform is the epic, the evolution of the universe from the big bang.11[22_Notes.html#fn-c13_en11]The reasoning that because something is strong it deserves to become stronger isnoteworthy. Wilson’s attitude here may look superficially like Dobzhansky’s, butit is really quite different. Dobzhansky is expressing his own highly complexfaith, and is much concerned with its difficulties. Wilson, in a manner all toofamiliar to Christians, is asking ‘what faith does the age require?’ He is in nodoubt about the answer, which he gives in the conclusion of On Human Nature:The true Promethean spirit of science … constructs the mythology of scientificmaterialism, guided by the corrective devices of the scientific method,addressed with precise and deliberately affective appeal to the deepest needs ofhuman nature, and kept strong by the blind hopes that the journey on which weare now embarked will be farther and better than the one just completed. (myitalics)12 [22_Notes.html#fn-c13_en12](It is interesting that the hopes are blind.) He is chiefly concerned with howbest to make converts. Dobzhansky, being deeply interested in other people’sfaiths and the problems which surround them, recognizes at once the religiouselements in his own position, and, drawing on his background in Russian OrthodoxChristianity, maps out the various religious and non-religious paths whichneighbour his own, considering them as real options. For Wilson the word‘religion’ seems to be little more than the banner of an alien tribe, whoseassets are to be raided. He seldom mentions any manifestation of religion whichis not openly crude and contemptible.Dobzhansky sees that science and religion cannot, properly speaking, be incompetition: ‘Science and religion deal with different aspects of existence. Ifone dares to overschematize for the sake of clarity, one may say that these arethe aspect of fact and the aspect of meaning.’13 [22_Notes.html#fn-c13_en13] Hedeals with many local conflicts between views on both sides, but aims steadilyto bring both into focus together. Wilson never doubts either that there isdirect competition or that it has been won, since science (in the form ofsociobiology) has ‘explained’ religion, while religion cannot explain science.14[22_Notes.html#fn-c13_en14]This is an amazingly confused position. Causal explanation (which is the onlykind offered) is not relevant to the value of the thing explained, as can beseen by thinking about the parallel case of a possible causal explanation ofmathematics or of science itself. Moreover, this causal explanation of religionis not actually provided; it is only promised and loosely sketched as a project.It consists of some familiar shaky speculations about the way in which variousreligions might help the survival of tribes professing them, plus the a prioriruling that not only religion in general, but also a preference for a particularkind of religion, is genetically determined. What Wilson is really trying to dois to account for the existence and power of religion, on the uncriticizedassumption that its content is nothing but a load of humbug. Some peopleapproach questions about the existence and power of sociobiology in the samespirit. In neither case does this seem to be a useful way to understand thephenomenon.One last contrast: Dobzhansky really does understand the difference betweenideals and predictions, and Wilson does not. Prophets can fairly deal in boththese wares, but it is vital that they should grasp the distinction. Predictionsget their support from factual evidence. Ideals get theirs from considerationsof value. From its outset, the Wellsian tradition of prophecy, centring on adistorted, emotive notion of ‘science’, has mixed these methods. It has tendedto represent its own chosen conception of the future as obligatory because itwas inevitable, and vice versa. The roots of this bad habit go back toNietzsche, who first suggested answering the question ‘why should we do this?’by saying ‘because the future calls for it’. Nietzsche’s main point was thatthis is a better answer than ‘because we have always done it in the past’. Evenif this is true – which is none too obvious – neither option is any substitutefor relevant reasons."},{"pageContent":" 14 The Service of Self and the Service of KaliThough Nature, red in tooth and claw With ravin, shrieked against his creed …Are God and Nature then at strife That Nature lends such evil dreams? So careful of the type she seems,So careless of the single life;‘So careful of the type?’ but no From scarped cliff and quarried stone She cries, ‘A thousand types are gone;I care for nothing; all shall go.’Alfred Lord Tennyson, In Memoriam, LV–LVINature’s Redness and the Abuse of Common SpeechWe move on now from strange beliefs based on optimistic distortions ofevolutionary theory to ones based on pessimistic distortions, from Lamarck’sescalator to nature red in tooth and claw. Are we then still in realms whichought to be called religious at all? Certainly this is a gloomy and alarmingcult. But it is still one celebrated with powerful incantations, such asTennyson’s and that of M. T. Ghiselin (quoted on p. 3 and to be looked at againshortly). As we have already seen, even the cosmic escalator, when set against asufficiently vast and disheartening backdrop, can give a deeply gloomyimpression. Yet the drama to which this picture contributes is certainlyspiritually ambitious enough to constitute a faith and in some sense a religion.We need to notice here the general place of gloomy elements in religions. Mostof the Greek and Roman deities were sometimes deeply destructive, and some –Hecate, Nemesis, Pluto – dealt with death as their main function. Still moreinteresting is the Hindu trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Siva – Creator, Preserverand Destroyer. Siva, and still more his wife Kali, stand for death. And death isindeed a most necessary balance to the rich fertility that flows from the firsttwo members. In the context of the whole, these deities supply a grave andbecoming element. When, however, they are worshipped on their own, some very oddactivity and even odder motivation tend to be involved. Thugs serve the goddessby ritual murder of strangers. Still more remarkably, ecstatic devotees perishby throwing themselves under the car of Jagarnath.That exaltation of pure destruction seems to me to be the main inspiration ofGhiselin’s hymn to egoism and of other passages like it. This is a paradoxicalsuggestion, since in theory these passages celebrate an all-conquering urge toself-preservation. The emphasis in them, however, is never on the delights ofthe life which is to be preserved. It is all on an uncompromising determinationto ditch all competitors. The mood celebrated is one of total destructivecallousness. Tennyson and Ghiselin differ, however, about who owns this mood.For Tennyson it is still the figure of personified nature. Since God is stillpresent, this shows us a kind of Huxleyan cosmic war in which another mood isstill contending against this one. Ghiselin, by contrast, makes the moodentirely universal and uses no personification. He attributes it directly to allorganisms.Since most organisms are plants, which do not have motives, this seems strange.But in any case sociobiologists say plainly that they are not actually talkingabout motives at all. When they use words which are the ordinary names ofmotives, they officially do so with a quite different and technical meaning.This equivocation makes possible a chronic, pervasive play upon words. Acolourful, familiar psychological myth is conveyed through the everydaymeanings, and from time to time endorsed in unmistakable terms by the author –as it is here – without needing any actual discussion or support, becauseofficially nothing but a theory in population genetics is on sale.Trouble centres on the word selfish. For sociobiologists, this word isofficially not the name of a motive at all, but a term used to describe acomplicated, highly abstract and unfamiliar causal property – the tendency tomaximize one’s own gene representation in future generations. This is much likeusing the word cruelty to describe all behaviour which will cause suffering toanyone else in any future generation, or the word sloth to describe all thatwhich will fail to affect them. Why such a word should ever have been chosen, ifno reference to real selfishness was meant, is hard to imagine. Similar senses,however, are also given to the equally unsuitable motive-words, ‘spite’ and‘altruism’.Now clumsy and ill-chosen scientific terms do not do much harm where their useis segregated from ordinary discourse. But this is not such a field. And thereis in any case one kind of situation where they cannot be harmless, namely wheretheir everyday sense also applies, and gives a common, familiar meaning withimportant consequences. The dangers of this situation are of course multipliedwhen a wide audience is being addressed. And it happens that the claim to detectordinary, literal selfishness as an underlying motive, vitiating claims to otherand better motives, is just such an everyday move. Its consequences arenecessarily important, because it is so often used to justify retaliation.The fact that ‘selfishness’ in its ordinary sense is not just the name of amotive but of a fault naturally makes things much worse. To widen the imputationof selfishness is to alter people’s view of the human race. This widening had ofcourse already been deliberately undertaken by various thinkers who havedeveloped theories of psychological egoism, and had been given a specialpolitical function by Hobbes and his followers in social-contract theory. Peoplein society were then held not to have any motive in their interactions otherthan self-interest. If this bizarre story had been true, the notion ofselfishness could never have arisen. Had regard for others really beenimpossible, there could have been no word for failing to have it. And it needsto be stressed that the word ‘selfish’ in its normal use is essentially anegative word. It means a shortage of this normal regard for others. Callingsomebody selfish simply does not mean that they are prudent or successfullyself-preserving. It merely says that they are exceptional – and faulty – inhaving too little care for anybody else.Accordingly, egoist writers cannot properly use the term ‘selfish’ at all. Theirtheory excludes it. This is so obvious that usually they do not make thismistake. There is, however, a temptation to cheat by retaining it, because thismakes possible the use of egoism to justify retributive bloody-mindedness basedon a low opinion of our fellow-men. Egoist cheats enquire why we should beexpected to bother about the rest of the human race, which has been provedguilty of the sin of selfishness? They warn anyone who is still rash enough tobe unselfish that they are out on a limb and should quickly fall in line withthe already universal tendency.Various Struggles for Various ExistencesThe absurdity of this talk has of course often been pointed out, and no one hasany excuse for again attempting today to foist it on a long-suffering public.Historical chance, however, has favoured it by entangling it twice withapparently reputable scientific views. The first time this happened was ineconomics, when the early political economists conceived the idea thatenlightened self-interest was the best path to promoting the interests of all,and called for commercial free enterprise unshackled by any restraints imposedto protect its victims. The second time was over evolution.This happened quite independently of Darwin. Tennyson published In Memoriam in1850. Malthus had published his Essay on Population in 1798. The Origin ofSpecies did not come out till 1859. Many others besides Darwin could see thedrama implicit in the idea of a struggle for existence, and could project itloosely from the field of chaotic human life in a disturbed and rapidly changingsociety on to the vast, vague background of organic life generally. WhereDarwin’s invaluable special insight came in was in also grasping the differencesbetween these fields. This released his imagination to work realistically in thebiological one, and to work out in detail the way in which natural selectioncould be seen as a constructive force. Most other theorists oscillated in anuncontrolled way between the two fields, assuming what suited them about biologyto make the points they wanted to make about society at the time.Here again, of course, the dominant figure was Herbert Spencer, who had nohesitation at all about this proceeding. With only the most casual acquaintancewith biology he promoted his notion of the ‘survival of the fittest’ as a socialideal. This had enormous effect, above all in the United States, where heoutsold every other philosopher in his day. Two examples of the kind of thingwhich resulted must suffice; we are all too familiar with it still. Both comefrom direct disciples of Spencer’s in America:The millionaires are a product of natural selection, acting on the whole body ofmen to pick out those who can meet the requirement of certain work to be done… .It is because they are thus selected that wealth – both their own and thatentrusted to them – aggregates under their hands… . They may fairly be regardedas the naturally selected agents of society for certain work. They get highwages and live in luxury, but the bargain is a good one for society. There isthe intensest competition for their place and occupation. This assures us thatall who are competent for this function will be employed in it, so that the costof it will be reduced to the lowest terms.1 [22_Notes.html#fn-c14_en1]And again, with a sharp illumination of the fatalistic aspect, RichardHofstadter in his admirable analysis of Social Darwinism observes how:acceptance of the Spencerian philosophy brought about a paralysis of the will toreform… . Youmans [Spencer’s chief American spokesman] in Henry George’spresence denounced with great fervour the political corruption of New York andthe selfishness of the rich in ignoring or promoting it when they found itprofitable to do so. ‘What do you propose to do about it?’ George asked. Youmansreplied ‘Nothing! You and I can do nothing at all. It’s all a matter ofevolution. Perhaps in four or five thousand years evolution may have carried menbeyond this state of things.’2 [22_Notes.html#fn-c14_en2]For one example from Europe, we can look at Hitler’s Table-Talk:If we did not respect the law of nature, imposing our will by the right of thestronger, a day would come when the wild animals would again devour us – thenthe insects would eat the wild animals, and finally nothing would exist exceptthe microbes… . By means of the struggle the elites are continually renewed. Thelaw of selection justifies this incessant struggle by allowing the survival ofthe fittest. Christianity is a rebellion against natural law, a protest againstnature.3 [22_Notes.html#fn-c14_en3]Darwin himself set his face steadily against this kind of thing, which appalledhim, and he went to considerable trouble in The Descent of Man to point out thedeep general difference between the kind of qualities which could make itpossible for a social group to survive over many generations,4[22_Notes.html#fn-c14_en4] and those that might keep a single individual afloatfor his lifetime. Recent attempts to convict him too of ‘Social Darwinism’ donot refute this; they only show that (as is obvious) he was a man of his age;that there were limits to his criticisms of accepted ideas and institutions.This is true of all of us. But the particular mistake of treating all animallife as a matter of individual cut-throat competition was one which it was outof the question for Darwin to make, because he was a serious, full-timenaturalist. He knew a great deal about the life of (for instance) birds, aboutparental care, warning cries and loyalty to the family and flock. ‘The socialinstincts’ were a central interest of his. In his mind they were always presentin proper balance against the waste and cruelty of natural life.Huxley and the Exaggeration of ConflictT. H. Huxley, too, spoke out extremely strongly against the Spencerist mystique.Indeed he did so more often than Darwin, because in his day it had grown evenmore influential and was beginning to be an alarming force in politics. ButHuxley’s approach was significantly different just because he was not anaturalist. (His first ambition in life had been to be an engineer, and his onefield trip on the Rattlesnake never really altered this angle.) To him, it wasconvincing enough that brutal competition ruled unchallenged over all otherlife-forms, provided that the human race was excepted. Human virtues, forHuxley, were a sudden ‘ethical process’ undertaken in reverse of the entireremainder of the ‘cosmic process’, that is, of laws governing everything else inthe universe. This view leaves as quite legitimate a Hitlerian description ofevolution, and only objects to the inclusion of man within it.Huxley’s attempt to stop at this point has been very widely imitated, but it issurely an almost impossible enterprise. If it had really been true that noorganism stood in any relation to any other except a competitive one – if mutualdestruction had been the only kind of interaction – the idea that a singlespecies could suddenly engage on something else would indeed have been anextraordinary one. Alfred Russell Wallace’s idea that an immortal soul had beensuddenly implanted would be the least that would be needed to account for such areversal, and even this seems quite inadequate for the job.5[22_Notes.html#fn-c14_en5]It is necessary to abandon this dramatic picture for something much morerealistic. In fact, nature is green long before she is red, and must be green ona very large scale indeed to provide a context for redness. Organismsco-operate, profiting by each other’s presence. As Darwin already pointed out inThe Origin of Species, the ‘struggle for existence’ can often be described justas well as a mutual dependence.6 [22_Notes.html#fn-c14_en6] And harmlesscoexistence as parts of the same ecosphere is also a very common relation.The astonishment with which Europeans tend still to see films of creatures ofdifferent kinds quietly grazing together, with carnivores resting placidly at nogreat distance, testifies to the unreality of our drama. This relation, too, iscertainly more positive than the ignorant among us might suppose. A grazinganimal which is kept in a field with another of a different species may not seemto pay it any attention, but if one is removed, the other will be much upset,and will pine. (It would be hard to say more of many coexisting pairs of humanbeings.) Among social creatures, positive gregariousness, a liking for eachother’s company, is the steady, unnoticed background for the conflicts. For lesssocial creatures and for plants, the ability to live among others with a steady,mild exchange of benefits is usually a necessity. Ghiselin’s story that all thisco-operation is really only a carefully thought-out means to individual survivalis just a gratuitous animistic fancy. It would be quite as sensible to say thatthe individuals are only there for the sake of the collectivity, which hassubtly deluded them into supposing that they exist only for themselves.Sociobiological Sense and NonsenseThe extraordinary thing about sociobiology is that, officially and properlyspeaking, it arises from the recognition of this sociality in advanced creaturesand is simply a set of theories to account for it. Although its rhetoric treatsthat sociality as a myth, its theoretical task is to admit it as a fact and tomake evolutionary sense of it.In essence, it is simply a study of the conditions under which social tendenciescan be inherited in the process of natural selection. It arose from an insightof the great geneticist J. B. S. Haldane’s about how capacities for altruisticbehaviour could be passed on in evolution. If the Spencerist view of naturalselection as plain, cut-throat, individual competition had been correct, thiswould simply have been impossible. Biologists had long realized this, but couldnot see what happened instead. What Haldane grasped was that tendencies leadingto self-sacrifice could be transmitted provided that they were helpful to thosewho shared one’s genes. This is ‘kin-selection’. Willingness to die in defenceof children or other relatives may destroy the first individual who has it, butif enough descendants who share that tendency are left, genes conducive to itsurvive and may possibly spread to the whole community. The question just is,how many descendants are enough?The story goes that Haldane, having thought of this in a pub, promptly seized anold envelope and became immersed in calculations. He finally emerged, declaring,‘I am willing to die for four uncles or eight cousins’, that being the numberwho are needed to replace one’s own genes in the tribal gene-pool. This is thesort of calculation which has been the prime business of sociobiologists eversince, and as Wilson puts it, the ‘central theoretical problem’ of thediscipline is still ‘how can altruism, which by definition reduces personalfitness, possibly evolve by natural selection?’7 [22_Notes.html#fn-c14_en7] Thecalculations have now become very sophisticated, and often give surprising andinteresting results.It is worth noticing, however, even in this initial casual story, how easily aconfusion arises which has caused trouble ever since. Haldane spoke as if theanswer to his genetic calculations could decide whether he would – or perhapsshould? – die for his relatives. Of course all such strong, directinterpretations are wild and illicit. All that can reasonably be concluded fromsuch evidence must remain very general and statistical, claiming merely that,where innate traits are transmitted without benefiting their owner, they must onaverage have bene-fited close kin in rough proportion to their closeness. Thedefence of children, in fact, does not stand alone. It is merely the strongestand simplest case."},{"pageContent":" 15 Who or What is Selfish?Varieties of entities are not to be multiplied beyond necessity.William of OccamHidden AgentsOnce this is realized, the puzzle about how altruistic traits can have developedought to vanish; it has been solved. It continues, however, to worrysociobiologists and to present itself as somehow disturbing and anomalous. The‘problem of altruism’ keeps recurring. To solve it, a model is developed wherebyeach organism is really aiming at its own advantage, but finds it not in thislife but in ‘inclusive fitness’, that is in having many descendants. In some waythis is held to remove the anomaly, to show that nothing was really done for thesake of others after all. Alternatively organisms themselves are seen as beinggenuinely altruistic, but being so only as the dupes of their genes, whichappear as the real agents, egoists behind the scenes organizing the performance.Thus Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene:The argument of this book is that we, and all other animals, are machinescreated by our genes. Like successful Chicago gangsters, our genes havesurvived, in some cases for millions of years, in a highly competitive world.This entitles us to expect certain qualities in our genes. I shall argue that apredominant quality to be expected in a successful gene is ruthlessselfishness.… If you wish … to build a society in which individuals co-operategenerously towards a common good, you can expect little help from biologicalnature. Let us try to teach generosity and altruism, because we are bornselfish.1 [22_Notes.html#fn-c15_en1]And E. O. Wilson:The individual organism is only the vehicle (of genes), part of an elaboratedevice to preserve and spread them with the least possible biochemicalperturbation.… The organism is only DNA’s way of making more DNA.2[22_Notes.html#fn-c15_en2]Dawkins’s remarks here show with beautiful clarity the full series of movesneeded to complete this confusion. First, there is the old-fashioned ‘beanbag’genetics, similar to that used by Monod, which supposed genes themselves to beisolated items tossed around in a randomizer, rather than the closely linked andregularly interworking components which they are now known to be. (Geneticiststend to despise sociobiology, and with some reason.) Then there is the animisticmove – which Monod would have sharply rejected – of personifying the gene anddescribing this supposed competition in highly emotive terms as a deliberateproject. Then comes the point where the quickness of the hand most needs todeceive the eye – the transfer of ‘selfishness’ from genes to organisms – ‘weare born selfish’.Finally there is the quite explicit drawing of a social moral – an extraordinarymove if the behaviour of genes had really been the only thing under discussion –to the effect that human nature is totally iniquitous and unregenerate and anysalvation for it can only come from some outside source. Since, in this highlyanti-theistic context, no outside source is imaginable, this can only be theHuxleyan position in its most forbidding and discouraging form. It can onlyamount to a counsel of despair: the resigned, fatalistic acceptance of iniquityas inevitable which is the usual moral of Spencerist theorizing. This isstrongly supported by Dawkins’s habitual rhetoric in elevating the gene from itsreal position as a humble piece of goo within cells to a malign and all-powerfulagent:It does not grow senile; it is no more likely to die when it is a million yearsold than when it is only a hundred. It leaps from body to body down thegenerations, manipulating body after body in its own way and for its own ends,abandoning a succession of mortal bodies before they sink in senility and death.The genes are the immortals.3 [22_Notes.html#fn-c15_en3]This impression, of course, depends on treating the type as a single entity andforgetting that each particular gene dies in the cell it belongs to. It would beno more and no less true to say that humanity did this, being representedsuccessively by different individuals but transcending and outlasting them all.Again, the causal importance of genes is constantly exaggerated by a meaninglessdown-grading of other kinds of causes:By dictating the way survival machines and their nervous systems are built,genes exert ultimate power over behaviour.… Genes are the primary policy-makers;brains are the executives.… The logical conclusion to this trend (towardsincreasing intelligence) not yet reached in any species, would be for the genesto give the survival machine a single overall policy instruction – ‘do whateveryou think best to keep us alive’.4 [22_Notes.html#fn-c15_en4]If that were the situation, what could possibly be the sense of trying to defeatthe genes by trying (for the first time in human history, as Dawkins explains)to start up some genuine altruistic behaviour – a move which must necessarily bejust one more wily device on their part to secure their own survival?We should notice that ‘ultimate power’ is a meaningless phrase; sciencerecognizes no causes which are not themselves subject to other causes, and theprocess of heredity has any number of other kinds of cause as well as geneticones. But if there were indeed a being with ‘ultimate power’, it wouldpresumably be one against which we were totally impotent. Though this idea hasno place in science, it is extremely suggestive to the religious sensibilities.Worship, as we have already seen, is not only something carried out in Gothicbuildings by people singing Hymns A. & M. It has many other forms and can beentirely informal. It is certainly the mood most strongly suggested by Dawkins’sdiscussions of the gene.The Difficulty of not Talking About MotivesSociobiological thinking, then, seems to conduct, side by side with itsperfectly respectable attempt to account for the inherited co-operativetendencies of plants and animals, a very different and far less respectablemyth-making activity. This commits it either (if individual selfishness ismeant) to supporting a psychological egoism which is inconsistent with the veryrecognition that these tendencies exist, or (if gene-selfishness is preferred)to a story which is quite meaningless unless it is taken literally as afatalistic acceptance of a non-human entity, endowed with such power over usthat its purposes determine all our acts, and against which it is thereforesenseless to strive. And if both ideas are combined, both drawbacks areavailable together.Can this really be the situation? Officially, as has been pointed out,sociobiologists cannot be proposing psychological egoism, because they are notsupposed to be talking about motives at all. But since they are claiming thatwhat they call selfishness is indeed the root cause of most, if not allbehaviour, what they say continually has this meaning. When readers understandit this way, the writers usually express surprise at such perversemisinterpretation of a harmless technical term. But they do it themselves allthe time. In each sociobiological writer, an everyday Mr Hyde proceeds on hisHobbesian debunking psychoanalytic path, entirely regardless of scientific DrJekyll, who has just outlawed it. There is constant and explicit mention ofmotives, often even of conscious motives, as critics have repeatedly pointedout. Yet again, I give a few entirely typical examples. In On Human Nature,which appeared in 1978, after the matter had been well aired in controversy,Edward O. Wilson writes that nearly all altruism is of the ‘soft-core’ kind,which means that it isultimately selfish. The ‘altruist’ expects reciprocation from society forhimself or his closest relatives. His good behaviour is calculating, often in awholly conscious way.… The capacity for soft-core altruism can be expected tohave evolved primarily by selection of individuals and to be deeply influencedby the vagaries of cultural evolution. Its psychological vehicles are lying,pretense and deceit, including self-deceit, because the actor is most convincingwho believes that his performance is real. (my italics)5[22_Notes.html#fn-c15_en5]This kind of story is continually stated, as it is here, explicitly as anaccount of motivation, an account which is meant to conflict with other possibleaccounts of it and prove them to be mistakes or lies. If these stories hadreally been only about evolutionary function, that clash could not arise.As for the rare ‘hard-core altruism’ or genuine self-sacrifice, that, Wilsongoes on to explain, is certainly no better. ‘Pure, hard-core altruism based onkin-selection is the enemy of civilization.’6 [22_Notes.html#fn-c15_en6] It isnot (he explains) really an unusual case of genuine charity, but a mere mindlessdeath-wish. That, again, makes it a motive, and Wilson’s calling it ‘irrational’can only mean that the only possible rational motive is self-interest. This canbe nothing but crude, Hobbesian psychological egoism, altered only by thebizarre substitution of gene-maximization for self-preservation as theindividual’s aim.Similar, as we have seen, is the message of M. T. Ghiselin:The evolution of society fits the Darwinian paradigm in its most individualisticform. The economy of nature is competitive from beginning to end. Understandthat economy, and how it works, and the underlying reasons for social phenomenaare manifest. They are the means by which one organism gains some advantage tothe detriment of another.At this point, suddenly and without apology, the motives appear:No hint of genuine charity ameliorates our vision of society, oncesentimentalism has been laid aside. What passes for co-operation turns out to bea mixture of opportunism and exploitation. The impulses that lead one animal tosacrifice himself for another turn out to have their ultimate rationale ingaining advantage over a third; and acts ‘for the good’ of one society turn outto be performed for the detriment of the rest. Where it is in his own interest,every organism may reasonably be expected to aid his fellows. Where he has noalternative, he submits to the yoke of communal servitude. Yet given a fullchance to act in his own interest, nothing but expediency will restrain him frombrutalizing, from maiming, from murdering – his brother, his mate, his parent orhis child. Scratch an ‘altruist’ and watch a ‘hypocrite’ bleed.7[22_Notes.html#fn-c15_en7]That this sort of thing is pure fantasy, unrelated to any basis in science andindeed contrary to sociobiological findings so far as these do bear onmotivation, has been mentioned already and will need to be mentioned again. Wewill come back to the whole background of mindless individualism which makes itseem plausible in the last two chapters. One thing, however, which deserves amoment’s immediate attention is Ghiselin’s use of inverted commas. It hasevidently struck him that other terms besides ‘altruism’ may be affected by thestrong solvent he wants to apply, and it is unlucky that he did not follow upthis suspicion further. The hypocrisy involved in pretending to be altruisticwould indeed be impossible in the world he invokes, and the scandalized,hysterical air of a hero unmasking villainy would be quite meaningless. Againsta real Hobbesian background, one cannot play this melodrama at all.David Barash, another central prophet of sociobiology, shows the same strangeconfusion, except that he is even more chronically prone to open psychologizing,using the idea of unconscious motivation in the hope of showing that this doesnot matter. That evolutionary promptings are unconscious selfish motives is acentral theme of Sociobiology; The Whisperings Within8[22_Notes.html#fn-c15_en8] and their mode of working is conceived throughout inthe way proclaimed by his opening manifesto: ‘We will analyse parentalbehaviours, showing the underlying selfishness of our behaviour towards others,even our own children.’9 [22_Notes.html#fn-c15_en9] This is an impossiblephrase. If ‘selfishness’ means here what sociobiologists say it means – atendency to maximize one’s own future gene-spread – it is directly displayedalready in all care given by parents to children. There could be no furtherlayer of it to reveal. If, by contrast, it names here something secret,underlying, and – as he suggests – disreputable, it must mean ‘selfishness’ as amotive, as we ordinarily understand that word. Nor are things any better in hisbook Sociobiology and Behaviour:It is always nice to be nice to someone else. But it is unlikely to beadaptive.… Moral injunctions are simply irrelevant to the evolutionary process.Insofar as animals possess genetically mediated tendencies to behave for thebenefit of another, the logic of evolution demands that these tendencies begrounded in underlying selfishness.10 [22_Notes.html#fn-c15_en10]Again, why underlying? The tendency to increase one’s own genespread is not onemotive lying hidden under another in the psychological layering, but a quiteseparate kind of causal property. All that is needed is to say that altruistictendencies must be compatible with gene-promotion, that is they must not preventit. And, as the central insight of sociobiology so usefully shows, behaviourthat benefits others does not prevent it, provided that those others usuallyshare one’s genes. Kin-selection makes possible the spread of tendencies whichare – considered as real motives – thoroughly unselfish in the ordinary sense,such as affection for one’s children and the wish to help those in danger. Itcan make it extremely adaptive to be nice to others. And if we are worried aboutthe primacy this gives to kin, we should notice that this is a very looselimitation.Because these tendencies do not spring from calculation, but from inheriteddisposition, they cannot be regularly switched off when someone less closelyrelated heaves in sight. They are not strictly proportioned to bloodrelationship, but respond to many other cues, such as familiarity, admiration,liking and the special needs of others. And in human beings, the complexities ofculture can give them a much wider range of channels than is possible for otherspecies. In short, the Spencerist version of Hobbes, which supposed cut-throatindividual competition to be the mechanism of evolution, is a howling error, associobiologists themselves have pointed out. But when we drop it, we have todrop also the sneering claim to peculiar worldly wisdom, the pride in seeingthrough all human pretensions to virtue, which have seemed to provide the luxuryof superiority here. Virtue is as real a fact in the world as vice is, and thevariety of genuine human motives is also real. They need to be studied on theirown terms. Hobbes was only one contributor to the immensely complex, ancient andcontinuing business of investigating how motives work, and an exceptionallyone-sided one. He cannot possibly be used to bypass it altogether.The Fatalist AngleBesides egoism, however, there seems to be in sociobiology something hostile tofree will. It is often described as ‘biological determinism’. This language,however, seems too wide. It is not clear that determinism – in the sense ofbelief in the regularity of nature – damages human freedom. If it does, we havegot a real problem about the whole position of biology, quite independently ofthis controversy. The real blot on sociobiology is surely rather fatalism. Thereis a constant colourful invocation of non-human, but purposeful-sounding beings– usually the genes or DNA. These are treated as real calculating agents,manipulating human beings and other animals, who may suppose that they havepurposes of their own, but are deceived in this, being in fact only ineffectualpawns, puppets or vehicles of these ‘hidden masters’.11[22_Notes.html#fn-c15_en11]The tone is set in the opening manifesto of Sociobiology where Wilson, quotingwith surprising approval that resolute vitalist Samuel Butler, proclaims that‘the organism is only DNA’s way of making more DNA’.12[22_Notes.html#fn-c15_en12] What is the point of that only? What can it meanexcept that the motives and purposes which people think they have are unreal?They are being deceived and manipulated in the sort of way that someone is whosevery desires have been instilled into him by others for their own purposes.Because evolutionary function is being treated as a motive, it is seen as acompetitor with ordinary motives, and one with a deeper status, compared withwhich all these familiar motives are a mere superficial layer of humbug. Thisidea is displayed through a whole cornucopia of more or less mechanicalmetaphors, among which a favourite is that of programming computers. ThusBarash: ‘[Chess machines] are in the end nothing but the instructions thatcreated them, and they can do no more than follow the ultimate design of theirbuilders. Our builders are our genes.’13 [22_Notes.html#fn-c15_en13]An amazing variation on this is Wilson’s metaphor of taking the dog for a walk:‘The genes hold culture on a leash.… Human behaviour … is the circuitoustechnique by which human genetic material has been and will be kept intact.Morality has no other demonstrable ultimate function.’14[22_Notes.html#fn-c15_en14] What sort of way is this to describe the relationbetween two interacting sets of partial causes? Would it be any less true to saythat the climate holds genes on a leash? or that organisms do so? (Even culture,as sociobiologists concede, can have a marked effect on human gene-pools.)Officially, this habit of personifying genetic causes as governors is meant toindicate that they are the only ‘ultimate’ causes. But the idea that any set ofcauses could be ultimate or one-way is, as we have mentioned, a most confusedone, certainly not acceptable scientifically. What it actually conveys is thedetermination of sociobiologists to insist that their own causes are moreimportant than those which are found by other methods of enquiry. The effect is,of course, to produce bad science. Environmental causes are neglected withoutany justification being given, and so are causes which flow from an individualitself during its lifetime (for instance, when a particular animal starts amigration or sets the example of tapping a new food-source). In human affairs,both these areas are of course of the first importance, since they cover thewhole range of culture and individual action.To make it look plausible that sociobiology is as epoch-making as it claims, itis necessary to rule out the importance of these factors. It is also necessaryto exaggerate the importance of genetic causes by ruling that no geneticvariation can ever catch on except by being positively useful, that all is forthe best in the best of all possible worlds. Unless this is so, it is notpossible to reason back from the presence of a trait today and calculate thegenetic factors which can have caused it to develop. The imposing neatness ofthe theory, then, demands that only genetic causes of behaviour should be takenseriously, and it is therefore presented in metaphors which rule out humanfreedom, presenting people, along with other animals and plants, as machines.This attack on freedom is by no means a necessary consequence of admitting thatthere are these genetic causes at all. There certainly are, and their presenceis harmless to freedom, indeed it is a precondition of it, since a mere piece ofblank paper conditioned by its society would not be free. The enslaving elementin sociobiology does not come from this, but from the refusal to admit otherkinds of causes, a refusal which is often qualified or withdrawn at other placesin these books, but returns in force whenever either the scientific argument orthe rhetoric requires it.At that point the genetic forces appear as inescapable fates, and the rhetoricaltone varies between reverence for their power and contempt for humans whosuppose that any other element in life need concern them. It is stronglyfatalistic, that is not just resigned to evils which have been provedinevitable, but more generally contemptuous of all human effort, from a sense ofperceiving a conscious being which will not let it prevail. This fatalism, too,is linked to the egoism, since the being in question is treated as the primecase, the central example and source of the selfish motivation prevailingeverywhere else. It is, in fact, a simple self-justifying projection of humanselfishness.The mystique of egoism and fatalism, then, is a real part of socio-biologicalwritings. It cannot be shrugged off as a misinterpretation. And because of itsstridency it is extremely influential. It has done, and is still doing, enormousharm. It has confirmed the suspicions of social scientists and many others thatthere is something endemically depraved and sinister about all discussion ofhuman life which uses a biological point of view and an evolutionary context.It is useless for sociobiologists to plead what is perfectly true, that they arenot interested in exalting one race over another nor in proving tendentioustheories about the inheritance of intelligence. The continuity of their tonewith that of earlier Spencerists who did do these things is too strong. This isno accident either. The underlying moral and psychological distortions reallyhave not changed. The world-picture which this rhetoric displays is still theone crudely projected by those who glorified free-enterprise capitalism in itsbrash expansive stages by depicting both human nature and the biosphere asframed in its image. It is used now, as it was then, to justify thecharacter-faults typical of this cultural phase by treating them as universaland inevitable.That image of living things as competitors is not of course a complete fantasy.It has its place, if it is understood to be only one image among many. But likeall such images, when it is given exclusive status and viewed as a directdescription of the facts, it grossly distorts thought. To give it this status,the actual behaviour of plants and animals has to be carefully selected andoften tendentiously described. The same handful of examples turns up again andagain, with the same swift extrapolation to the whole biosphere. And much of theargument proceeds, quite independently of examples, by computer simulation fromimaginary cases.The dangers of this kind of apriorism are in theory well known. Monod reasonablyjeers at Engels for explaining the growth of barley in terms of the Marxiandialectic.15 [22_Notes.html#fn-c15_en15] But any conceptual scheme followedconfidently out of its originally useful area, unchecked by criticism, is liableto lead to similar absurdities. This is certainly happening in the study ofanimal behaviour. One of its founding fathers, Niko Tinbergen, reissuing hissplendid book The Study of Instinct in 1969, commented with considerable alarmon the changes taking place there:We can apply to ethology what F. A. Beach once said of American psychology, that‘in its haste to step into the twentieth century’ it had tried to rush throughthe preparatory, descriptive phase – a thing no natural science can afford todo. Having myself always spent long periods of exploratory watching of naturalevents, of pondering about what exactly it was in the observed behaviour that Iwanted to understand before developing an experimental attack, I find thistendency of prematurely plunging into quantification and experimentation, whichI observe in many younger workers, really disturbing.… A disproportionatelygreat effort is channelled into questions of causation of behaviour. I feel verystrongly that an equally intense effort ought to be made to understand theeffects of behaviour.… It is tempting to ponder this over-emphasis on studies ofcausation. I believe that it is partly due to the fact that, as the developmentof physics and chemistry have shown, knowledge of the causes underlying naturalevents provides us with the power to manipulate these events and ‘bully theminto subservience’.16 [22_Notes.html#fn-c15_en16]In short, the deity being worshipped is power. As Tinbergen goes on to pointout, this cannot any longer reasonably be viewed as a search for power forbenevolent ends, in order to rescue the human race from its troubles. Ourpresent troubles do not at all flow from a shortage of power but from a bad useof it. To prevent that bad use, we would need quite different kinds of enquiry,central among which is a better understanding of human motives. This is not tobe looked for from a simple-minded discipline which starts by ruling that onlyone kind of motive is possible and occupies itself in trying to prove this –still less if it also maintains, at the same time, that it is not concerned withmotives at all.Sociobiology is a false light because it is ‘reductive’ in the sense of rulingout other enquiries, of imposing its own chosen model as the only norm. But, farmore serious than this negative drawback, it is also, like many such reductivedisciplines, engaged on its own monstrous enterprise of illicit inflation. Tobalance the austere renunciation of religious ideas and of a normal view ofhuman standing in the biosphere, which Wilson and Dawkins denounce, they offerus a mystique of power, vicarious indeed but evidently, from the fervent tonewhich celebrates it, none the less exciting for that."},{"pageContent":" 16 Dreaming and WakingLike the choice between competing political institutions, that between competingparadigms proves to be a choice between incompatible modes of community life.Thomas KuhnDreams Become NightmaresIt is time to draw together the threads of this discussion. The myths and dramaswe have been considering are various. They do not express a single system but aloose conglomerate of moods, attitudes and beliefs. What they have in common is,first, that they centre on the theme of evolution. Second, that while stillusing official scientific language about this theme, they are quite contrary tocurrently accepted scientific doctrines about it. Third, that they arepowerfully emotive and sustaining. They are so shaped as to provide theiradherents with a lively faith which can be an important element in the meaningof their lives.Though they do not contain what for our culture are the central marks of areligion – belief in a personal deity and the explicit worship that goes with it– they seem to have grown up in response to needs which form some part of thegroup to which those giving rise to the religions belong. The tone in which theyare expressed makes it impossible to dismiss them as mere accidental factualerrors or formal survivals from obsolete doctrines. This tone is, typically,highly charged, though the charge varies strikingly over a range from theeuphoric to the despairing.At the euphoric end, a simple but groundless factual guarantee is offered of asecure and glorious future for the human race, a human heaven on earth as theinevitable end of the whole natural process. The mood is one of triumph tingedby reverence both for the future human beings themselves and for the forcerelied on to produce them, though it also contains elements of ordinary brashtechnological conceit. At the despairing end, a vision which is reminiscent ofthe darker elements in some traditional religions displays the universe not – asmodern science officially requires – simply as a linked set of physicalprocesses, but animistically, as a field for the play of malign forces attackingor exploiting humanity. Forms of this myth based on physics place this malignattitude in lifeless matter, centring on the mere failure of such matter to dosomething which could never rightly have been expected of it, namely to care forlife. Forms based on population genetics place it either in the gene or in amysterious, non-conscious analogue of motivation by ‘selfishness’, which isattributed to organisms themselves. Both pictures are fatalistic. Thoughnominally they tell us to fight back, they also emphasize human helplessness andthus a sense of being wholly dominated by whatever ‘selfish’ entities aredescribed as active in the proceedings, whether personified genes or our ownhidden motives.The purely physical picture does not, of course, deal directly with evolution.It simply supplies a sinister, discouraging background for it, one which cannotfail to come into view if the observer’s eye ever wanders past the margin of theeuphoric vision. The genetic picture also does this on top of its more directevolutionary meaning. Thus, both in Wilson and Dawkins, the apparently wholesomepurpose of rebuking human pride by putting our species in its place in the grandevolutionary perspective, is reduced to absurdity by the exaltation of the geneas the entity which is to teach us our insignificance. Wilson and Dawkins preachthat man is but dust, and is cut down as the flower of the field. But what issupposed to follow from this for our understanding of life is an arbitrary,selective debunking of all nonegoistic motivation. In their gloomier moments,these writers, along with Monod and Weinberg, seem to resemble chiefly thosepagan poets of the Dark Ages whose disgust and contempt for the world led them(as has been remarked) to imitate pretty well everything in Christianity exceptfaith, hope and charity.The Unavoidability of MeaningWhy does this happen? There is something of a dilemma here for dramatizers. Onthe one hand, the physical picture in its literal, impersonal form is scarcelygraspable at all by the human imagination. We can repeat figures and formulaewhich are supposed to describe vast cosmological processes, but they mean verylittle to us. And there certainly seems no reason why they should have anyconsequences for our present actions or feelings. In themselves they aremeaningless for us. But a hunger for meaning is central to our lives. It is notjust an accidental, irrelevant emotion, needing to be brushed aside as aninterference with thought. It is the wider motive of which our theoreticalcuriosity is only a part. It is the impulse of our imaginations to order theworld with a view to understanding and contemplating it – something which mustbe done before theory-building can even start. To keep this wider impulse out offactual investigations is not just emotionally difficult, it is conceptuallyimpossible. Yet to let it in is to relate science to our most general responsesto life, responses which normally involve drama and very easily build up intosome kind of religious attitude.Does the quest for meaning have to have this outcome? Many great scientists,such as Einstein, have found it an entirely natural one. It might seem as ifsmaller scientists, with smaller ideas, could avoid it more easily. And it is ofcourse a misfortune of our highly-organized age that quite a lot of people donow become professional enquirers simply for social reasons, without ever havingfelt strong theoretical curiosity at all. For them science is small. It cannever be anything but ‘normal science’, a rather dull, pre-regulated occupationdetached from the central meaning of their lives. But since boredom, which isthe natural response to such unmeaning occupations, is painful, it is no wonderthat they snatch at such myths and dramas as are made available to them, andreadily accept even ones which, like those we have mentioned, are quite illicitscientifically.The kind of impersonality which science requires simply cannot extend to totalabsence of meaning. It cannot demand – as is sometimes suggested – that allfacts should be treated as equally important. Facts have to be connected upsomehow, and in every system of connection some are more important than others.Enquiry cannot remain atom-istic, stacking them separately in standard boxes; itimposes priorities. And the systematized findings cannot remain colourless,detached from the general purposes of life. The kind of importance they have,the kind of colouring they take on, will be determined by the generalworld-picture which the enquirer accepts.The choice is not between integrating facts into one’s world-picture and keepingthem detached from it. It is between good and bad world-pictures. Theimpersonality required is not total detachment, because this is impossible. Itis responsible objectivity – the far more difficult task of becoming more awareof one’s world-picture, doing all one can to correct its more obvious faults,and showing it as plainly as possible to one’s readers in order that they mayknow fully what they are accepting. As far as emotional tone goes, this callsfor what Darwin offered: the very careful avoidance of all cheap and simpleranting which might carry people away to accept one’s views wholesale, but alsothe full, scrupulous expression of attitudes and feelings which seem to one,after thought, to be called for by the subject-matter. This is not unlike thekind of impersonality needed for good art, a transcending of one’s personallimitations to reach attitudes valuable to everybody.Science is not just a natural phenomenon; it is something done by people. Sincepeople are essentially purposive beings, it cannot fail to reflect their generalconceptions of what constitutes an important purpose. We can see this extremelyclearly when we look at cases at some distance. It is plain to us now howseventeenth-century thought, dominated by the two linked ideas of God andMechanism, achieved its remarkable results by treating the universe as a huge,changeless, eternal, divinely manufactured clock. We can also see – not directlybut because of later developments – how that model had its limitations andeventually needed to be altered.We see too how nineteenth-century thought, fired with the idea ofindividualistic progress by the Industrial Revolution, by expanding empire andby the social-contract model, accepted a quite different, dynamic picture of asteadily evolving world, a world in which enlightened self-interest was asufficient force to lead life all the way from the primal soup to a predictableearthly heaven. We can by now see the historical reasons why such a pictureshould ever have been projected on to the cosmos, and also a great many reasonswhy it too, in spite of the good work which it has made possible, was bound inthe end to prove inadequate. Some of its earliest and most obviously crude formshave long been denounced under the inappropriate name of ‘Social Darwinism’. Butin its general outline it still persists, because to get rid of such a pictureone has to replace it fully by another, and this has not yet been done. Thereare probably dozens of different elements in our thought which still needradical changes before we can free ourselves from the distorting influences ofthis picture, even though we well know that there is a great deal wrong with it,and have long been accustomed to use the word ‘Victorian’ patronizingly, as aterm of abuse.Demons and Their DangersIn this book, I am trying to deal with a few of them; most deeply, perhaps, withthe idea that what was chiefly needed for the current phase of this splendidprogress was just to get rid of religion and replace it by science. Thedistortion that afflicts science when it is put into the place of religion is acentral part of my theme. And it does not seem to me to be altogether anaccident that attempts to remove religion produced a vacuum into which sciencewas to some extent sucked.In looking at the way people have expressed themselves in the course of theseattempts, I am struck by the strong intellectual need there is to have some viewof the cosmos as a whole. It does seem to me that the project of entirelydepersonalizing this view may not be a possible one. Possibly, for human beings,the only alternative to thinking of the universe as, in some vast and remoteway, purposive and benign, is to think of it as purposive and radicallymalignant. It may simply not be within our capacity – except of course by justavoiding thought – to think of it as having no sort of purpose or directionwhatever. And since the notion that it is radically malignant is a crazy one,benignity seems to be the only usable option.This sense of cosmic benignity can of course remain extremely remote and, byordinary standards, impersonal. It is not the same thing as belief in a distinctcreator, still less in a personal God who can be addressed. Of course theboundaries of these concepts are not easy to fix, and language is hard to useeffectively in discussing them. But it does seem clear that people who firmlydeny this benignity are extremely easily led on to assert that somethingactually vicious is present instead. They very readily begin to talk like A. E.Housman about ‘whatever brute or blackguard made the world’, or say like Hardythat ‘the President of the Immortals had finished his sport with Tess’.Obviously this kind of talk has its passing value as a corrective to acomplacent or childish kind of religion. But if it is taken seriously as morethan a passing corrective, it seems at once to become no less superstitious thanwhat it was trying to correct, and also far less usable for life.Such visions cannot be inert. They exist to guide conduct; it is of their natureto influence life. But the only practical consequences which this one seemscapable of producing are abominable. It imposes either a fatalistic, paralysingresignation to human helplessness before destructive forces, or a positivejustification for joining them in selfish mayhem. Also, like the Newtonianpicture, this Spencerian one makes it very hard to criticize the basic politicalpattern of the age. As the earlier one protected monarchical government, thelater one protects competitive individualism. Each reflects that currentlyaccepted pattern as part of the eternal order of things, invoking our respectfor science to make it look unchangeable. The modern one rules that only oneform of human activity can escape this general paralysis, namely the practice ofscience itself. The reasons for this exception are not at all clear.Undoubtedly, however, it has played a great part in getting the myth accepted.Without it, the moral bankruptcy of these ideas would have been obvious at once,and the faults of the whole underlying conceptual scheme would have been muchmore quickly seen.DaylightAs it is, they do seem to be beginning to be seen today. Although euphoricvisions of a guaranteed human future still persist – although the word ‘future’itself is still often used as the name for a simple, endless technologicalheaven – most people who think at all are now aware that objective probabilityunfortunately does not today offer us anything of the kind. Even among the rosypredictions still being given, we increasingly often hear the quite differentmessage that this or that technical fix must be tried because things are gettingvery bad, and desperate measures are called for. Apocalyptic propheciesalternate with the complacent ones in an uncontrolled way – a confusingsituation which is the price paid for our long refusal to understand how muchthe complacent ones were worth. There is little to be said for refusing to wakeup, even on a cold morning, if the dreams which we would like to prolong arethemselves increasingly invaded by spasms of nightmare.It cannot really be plausible today that world hunger, destruction of thebiosphere and the arms race merely form a slight temporary difficulty which ourcivilization cannot fail to surmount as it lifts us onward in the steady,inevitable progress of humanity. Naturally there is now an enormous demand fortheorists who will reassure us by saying that there is no serious threat here.To their credit, physical scientists have in general refused to deliver any suchshoddy article. Ecologists, geographers, biologists, oceanographers,agriculturalists, nutrition experts and the rest have mainly confirmed what theanthropologists and modern historians were also saying, that things are bad andrapidly getting worse. The only speciality that still finds itself in a positionto make reassuring noises is economics, a fact which may have something to dowith its habitual practice of never looking very far ahead.Even if the economists were right in their own field, however, the enlightenedbehaviour of men in markets would scarcely be enough to save the world. It couldnot cancel all the other messages, which read, not that nothing can be done, butthat a great deal of what is far from customary needs to be done, and donequickly. On this consensus, so deep are the current dangers that there is noserious possibility at all of predicting the long-term future of mankind.Unimaginable though we may find it, our civilization might well collapse, andthere is a real possibility that the species might become extinct.We are surrounded by serious predictions of climactic disasters, some of whichare beginning to be verified. These things sound as mythical as the visions wehave been considering, but they are sober scientific prose, produced quitecontrary to the myths of the age, not arising out of them. Many of them can takeplace even if war is avoided, simply from human expansion and destruction ofhabitat. So are the predictions of world famine, some of which (relating toEthiopia) the governments of the world have, as I write, just been neglectingand have been surprised to find verified.Science, which raised the curtain on dazzling visions of the human future andfor some time sustained them, now comes forward to bring down that curtain. Ifind it admirably symbolic that Carl Sagan, a great prophet of space travel, isnow taking the foremost place in spreading the news about nuclear winter. To mymind, that looks like a notable process of maturing, a formidable journey fromdreams to reality. This is not to deny, of course, that humankind, if it pullsitself together to meet its current challenge, might return to many of theambitious projects which it has today, and might even consider manned spaceexpeditions worth making. But at present what is needed above all is attentionto the current dangers. It is in that sense only that we can have any businessnow to occupy ourselves with the concept of ‘the future’."},{"pageContent":" 17 The Limits of IndividualismThere is also I know not what of fashion on this side; and by some means orother, the whole world almost is run into the extremes of insensibility towardsthe distresses of their fellow-creatures; so that general rules and exhortationsmust always be on the other side.Bishop ButlerIn the Lonely CrowdHow are we to adjust to this new situation, a situation made so much harder forus by the exceptionally euphoric myths on which we grew up? Certainly mankindcannot bear very much reality. Confronting here the father and mother of allproblems, we may deceive ourselves in two ways. We may try to pretend that theproblem is smaller than it is, that things have not yet gone badly wrong. Thiswill not get us far. More often we take refuge in fatalism, in concluding thatthere is nothing that we can do. Obviously, however, there is one part of theproblem which is more under our control than the rest. This is our own way ofthinking, the general ethos of the west. That does seem to have certain thingsdangerously wrong with it. Many people, therefore, call for a new ethic. Whatought we to do about this?John Passmore, in his thorough philosophical discussion, has very properlypointed out that new ethics cannot be bought like new hats.1[22_Notes.html#fn-c17_en1] Ethics, being patterns of incredible complexity, haveto be evolved, not manufactured, and they always build on what went before. Likeparadigms, they are part of the world-picture. And old ethics do not go in thedustbin. The range of moral insights possible to the human race probably doesnot change much, and all of them go on being needed on occasion. What doeschange drastically is the emphasis. Quite a small change in emphasis can make anenormous difference to life. In every age, morality has a bias. It is obvious tothose who come after, but history shows us how hard even the most astute peoplefind it to detect where the bias of their own age lies. As the Devil points outin The Screwtape Letters, the results can be highly ludicrous:The game is to have them all running about with fire extinguishers when there isa flood, and all crowding to that side of the boat which is already gunwaleunder. Thus (says the Devil) we make it fashionable to expose the dangers ofenthusiasm at the very moment when they are all becoming worldly and lukewarm …Cruel ages are put on their guard against Sentimentality, feckless and idle onesagainst Respectability, lecherous ones against Puritanism, and whenever all menare really hastening to be slaves or tyrants, we make Liberalism the primebogey.2 [22_Notes.html#fn-c17_en2]What bias, then, is now misleading us? I am suggesting that it is an unbridled,exaggerated individualism, taken for granted as much by the left as by the right– an unrealistic acceptance of competitiveness as central to human nature.People not only are selfish and greedy, they hold psychological andphilosophical theories which tell them they ought to be selfish and greedy. Andthe defects of those theories have not been fully noticed.In a sense which we have just been exploring, Social Darwinism or Spencerism isthe unofficial religion of the west. The official western religion,Christianity, is well known to be rather demanding and to have its eye on thenext world rather than this one. In such situations, other doctrines step in tofill the gap. People want a religion for this world as well. They find it in theworship of individual success. The fast buck itself is not exactly an end, sincenobody can eat paper, but it is valued primarily both as a means to this successand as a sign of it.Contemporary greed is sometimes called materialism. This does not seem to bequite right, since people’s material needs are limited, and could all be met atquite modest expense. Most of the goods greedily demanded are wanted for otherreasons which are imaginative and symbolic. They are seen as necessaryassurances of individual status within the boiling maelstrom of contemporarywestern life, a setting where crowding and constant movement impose socialstrains unknown to almost any other culture. And it is widely believed that thetheory of evolution proves this kind of narrowly self-assertive motivation to benot just an unfortunate response to certain local social conditions, butfundamental, universal and in some sense the law of life. Mystical reverence forsuch deities as progress, nature and the life-force is then invoked to explainand justify cut-throat competition.As we have seen, such a view of the natural motivation of our species is simplya mistake, a projection of current interests. It finds no support in biology. Ihave not attacked Spencerism in the usual way, namely, for reasoning illicitlyfrom facts to values. That attack would concede its view of the facts ascorrect, which it is not. I have pointed out instead how badly it is wrong onits facts, and how much we need to get these very important facts right.Not all facts are irrelevant to values, only some. This particular set of factsabout natural motivation seems relevant enough. If there were a social speciesso extraordinary as to be by its nature entirely egoistic, it would have littlechoice but to live egoistically, in unmitigated competition, conducting a war ofall against all, or controlling it only by bargains made for safety. But it ishard to see how such a creature could ever have become social or capable ofreasoning, which requires attention to the views of others. Certainly it couldnever have entertained – as we are now doing – any criticism of egoism. There isoverwhelming evidence that ours is not such a species.The Bias of Social Contract EthicsWhy, in that case, should anybody ever have thought that it was? Here we reachthe sore place, the nub of the problem. Individualism is tied up with much thatwe rightly value very highly. Ever since the Renaissance, it has been a keyproject of our culture to free individuals from the pressure of their socialbackground and to enable them to stand alone. Endless devoted efforts have beenmade to pry each loose from his family, his state, his church and any othershell to which he might cling, and allow him – indeed force him – to think andact for himself. (Himself, but not always herself – a feature which for sometime made the project look more promising than it actually was. Altruism wasstill expected of women.) The project was far wilder and more ambitious than wasusually noticed.Liberal political theory, from Hobbes onward, called on each citizen to viewhimself as primarily a distinct, autonomous atom, unlinked to his fellow atomsunless he contracts to join them. The sources of this project, indeed, are farolder; it started with the Greeks. Their efforts to encourage individual thoughtand responsibility gave rise to all that is most distinctive in ourcivilization. Christianity, with its emphasis on the separate, irreplaceablevalue of each human soul, also played a key part in the drama, which came intofull flower in the Enlightenment. The careful separating out of each soul fromits social background has of course been responsible for an immense amount thatis distinctive and valuable in the achievements of our civilization. No otherculture has carried it nearly so far. No wonder that to many people it neverlooked, until lately, as if we could ever have too much of that good thing,individualism.What has happened now, however, is that we seem to be left with littleconceptual ground to stand on when we want to make the opposite kind of pointand declare that the world is, after all, in some ways actually one, and thathuman beings exist only as parts of it. Why, for instance, should a Brazilianfarmer not cut down the rain forest to raise beef for a few years, moving onwhen the soil is exhausted and abandoning it to become a desert? or why shouldthe local manager for a multinational company not do the same? Are these peoplenot free agents?Contract-based prudential objections can certainly be found. We can say that theforest is a reservoir of species which may prove invaluable for medicine andother technologies, that the Indians (if provoked too far) will attemptreprisals, and that the effect of forest clearance will probably endangereveryone in the long run, since it would impoverish the whole of Brazil. Tothis, however, he may simply and consistently reply that, whatever happens, richBrazilians will always be safer than poor Brazilians, and multinationalcompanies making quick profits will always be safer than those making slow ones.The point of the present schemes is exactly to increase riches and therebyindividual safety.Now, it may be thought that these people have failed to grasp the full meaningof the social contract. And it is true that contractual ethics usually is notexpressed in this crude, predatory, ding-dong form. As philosophers display it,it can incorporate all sorts of impersonal, rational safeguards, hypotheticalrole-exchanges, veils of ignorance, and similar public-spirited devices. But ifthe atomic individuals who do the original contracting really conceive ofthemselves as essentially separate, it is hard to see why they should everbother about these procedures. The point is not just that, since they arewicked, they are unlikely to consider others, but that, since they are separate,they can have no reason to do so. They might happen to fancy such thoughts, butthere is nothing in their motivation to make them relevant.Of course, there are further appeals to prudence which can be made. Calculationsbased on the hope of becoming immensely rich are rather unreliable. A morerealistic, enlightened, Hobbesian self-interest might tell them to be lessdestructive, merely as an insurance policy. But narrowly selfish people tend notto be very imaginative, and often fail to look far ahead. That is one thingwhich the Industrial Revolution so far has made clear to us, and there is goodreason for it. Exclusive self-interest tends by its very nature not to beenlightened, because the imagination which has shrunk so far as to excludeconsideration for one’s neighbours also becomes weakened in its power to foreseefuture changes. Vice has its martyrs, as well as virtue. A great many aspiringegoists have crashed in attempting the feat which Howard Hughes, in his way,brought off, and his success – such as it was – no doubt involved luck as wellas cleverness.The psychology of this is very important. Hobbes really was mistaken insupposing that people could defer satisfaction indefinitely from prudence, thatthey were sufficiently patient, dispassionate, timid and far-sighted to build aharmonious world purely on bargains for self-interest. When other, more directsocial motives are weakened, as they are today, human prudence alone turns outquite unequal to the job.On every side now we can see people busily engaged in sawing off the branches onwhich they (along with many others) are sitting, intent only on getting thosebranches to market before the price of timber falls. Prudence does not preventthis destruction. It is therefore clear that what did to some extent prevent itin the past was a set of motives quite distinct from prudence and owing nothingto contract. They are, of course, the motives which until recently inhibited thefree development of technology. They are motives like conventionality,identification with one’s group, the fear of hubris, of novelty and excess,loyalty, respect for one’s elders, and a general awe at the mysterious othernessof nature.It would seem a good idea that we should now overhaul this mixed bag of motivescarefully, examine them, and sort out what is useful in them from what is not,re-expressing the useful part in terms suitable to our own day. There is plentyof material for this. Anthropologists, showing us how the cumulative nature ofculture demands continuity and how the murder of a culture can kill its members,have given us reason to have a far better opinion of conventionality, loyalty,identification with the group, and respect for the elders than we used to.Ecologists have pointed out that on the physical side there was good reason forthe fear of hubris, and for awe at the mysterious otherness of nature. They makeclear that we have only the most superficial understanding of the vast physicalsystems on which we depend, so that awe – as well as caution in change – isentirely rational. Social psychologists have drawn attention to the complexdependence of human individuals on their background. Ethologists have shown fromanimal parallels how deep the function of this is likely to be. Inpsychoanalysis, transactional thinking has broken the grip of Freudian egoismand made it possible to acknowledge human otherness.In general, whatever reservations anyone may have about particular parts of thisdevelopment, it must emerge that a whole set of communal aspects of life, whichused to be despised and attributed to the corrupting influence of religion, nowappear as both necessary and understandable in terms of the sciences. They arenot just instruments of political oppression but essential conditions of life.The Dark Side of the EnlightenmentThere remains, however, a general difficulty, inhibiting us as westernintellectuals from even considering these motives. Our superegos are veryunwilling to allow it. Internalized in each of us is a voice which speaks withthe accents of Voltaire and Rousseau, of Mill, Hume, Tom Paine and MaryWollstonecraft: a voice which says, ‘Was it for this that we defied the priests,the fathers, and the kings? Can anything be more important than individualliberty?’Unluckily, this voice comes now like a fire extinguisher in a flood. It candistract us, but not help us. Of course, there are still tyrants. But whatchiefly confronts us today is not an Easter Island row of ossified traditionalpatriarchs, but a chaotic mob of dollar-snatching cormorants, doing damage of anorder undreamed of in previous ages.Even in private life, it seems possible that sheer confusion of conflictingclaims now makes at least as much misery – if not more – as the confident appealto traditional authority. But the public issue is the one before us now.Observing the cormorants, we are in no doubt that we ought to disapprove ofthem, but our disapproval is forced to be indirect. Our tradition now lacks thenatural, obvious concepts by which most of the human race would denounceunbridled human predation. We cannot say – as almost any other culture could –that these people are betraying their ancestors, offending the ghosts, that theyare sacrilegious outcasts and matricides, destroying the land which gave thembirth. Very likely we are right to throw away this language, but we should notthrow away with it the power of expressing certain evident and crucial truths.Of course, human beings are distinct individuals. But they are also tiny,integral parts of this planet – framed by it, owing everything to it, andadapted to a certain place among its creatures. Each can indeed change its life,but does not originally invent it. Each receives life in a family (as a petaldoes in a flower), in a country (as the flower does on the tree), and in thebiosphere (as the tree does in the forest). Our environment gives us nearlyeverything we have and if, even as adults, we were deposited with all alienmodern conveniences on a planet of Sirius, we would (with all due respect toCarl Sagan) be no more than shrivelled petals.All this is no derogation of our essential dignity, because dignity ismeaningless without a context. The only person who might conceivably exist andmake sense on his own is God, and even He apparently prefers not to try it,since He creates the world. And whatever might be true of God, man is no god,but a social being and a part of the fauna of this planet. When the architectsof our present ethics were campaigning for individual liberty, this did not needsaying. It could safely be taken for granted. Today, with the damage whichunrealistic individualism is doing both to the physical life of the planet andto the personal happiness of individuals, it does need saying.We do not exactly need new concepts, since suitable ones do exist in ourculture. (John Passmore is right to insist that such concepts should always belooked for and used when possible, because the idea of an entirely unprecedentedmoral insight occurring for the first time in this epoch is a fishy one, andpeople are quite properly suspicious of it.) The concepts exist. But both theyand our current moral ideas need adapting in order to show their reality andimportance. Our world-picture needs to be changed, and is indeed alreadybeginning to be changed, to give them much greater prominence.What is now, rather oddly, beginning to be known as ‘libertarianism’ – theNozickian, explicit defence of the competitive ideal as primary against allothers – is a reaction against this incipient changing. Social, co-operativeideals have to be seen as taking a major, rather than a minor, part in practicalargument. Moral changes are perhaps, above all, changes in what kind of thingpeople are ashamed of. Till lately, our age was accustomed to classingenvironmental considerations as marginal, and so treating any emphasis on themas sentimental, emotional, unrealistic and – above all – insufficiently virile.(Some influential libertarians, notably Rousseau and Nietzsche, have beenobsessed with virility, a notion which still confuses radical thought.)The excesses of commercial free enterprise may be repulsive to us, but we arestill committed to seeing it as in some way proper and admirable, because it isstill a form of freedom. It appears as a monstrous parody of our most sacredideals. If there is really nothing more important than freedom, must that parodyat some level be embraced and accepted? Is there no way to be sure that thedestroyer is not an admirable Nietzschean superman?Using Our HeadsWhen things look as bad as this, it is usually best to ask: need we have startedfrom here? Having begun to consult the eighteenth-century oracle, perhaps itwill help to carry the process further. What has the Enlightenment really got totell us? It is pleasant to imagine the expression which would rise on the facesof Voltaire, Rousseau and Kant, if (having recalled them, much against theirprinciples, from the tomb) we explain to them that we find ourselves – twocenturies after their deaths – so imprisoned conceptually by their discoveriesthat we are unable to tackle the problem of adapting them to a new emergency anda different age. They themselves were bold innovators. In so far as anybody hasever produced a new ethic, they did. They knew that when the state of the worldchanges, new ideas must be used.What the ghost of Voltaire requires is that we should be willing to twist thetails of all sacred cows, including those from his own herd. The ghost ofRousseau tells us, first and foremost, to understand our own nature and itsplace in the nature of the universe. As for Kant, he advises us above all tothink independently and freely. And Nietzsche would have had as low an opinionof the multinationals as he had of the nationalists and anti-Semites of his day.None of them provides any ready-made conclusions, nor guarantees that theemphasis we need will be the same that was called for in their day. All changesof emphasis in morality are correctives, answering temporary needs. No suchchange can be final.Right through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it was reasonable forenquiring people to see their main enemy as feudalism, the theocratic andmonarchical hierarchy in which individuals were paralysingly embedded. TheIndustrial Revolution, releasing them to become socially mobile, naturallyappeared on the whole as a liberating force. This background explains whyDarwin’s views, when they appeared, were put to such extraordinary use. Theexisting intellectual furniture produced a powerful optical illusion, making thedoctrine of the survival of the fittest look like the precept ‘each for himselfand the devil take the hindmost’. Evolution seemed to endorse egoism and,thereby, unbridled capitalism.Despite protests from both scientists and philosophers, people still find thisinterpretation almost irresistible. It accounts for two rather seriousconfusions today. The first and cruder one is the recent revival of creationismamong educated people and even among some scientists. The project of treatingthe time scale of the Genesis story literally, as a piece of history, is anamazing one, which serious biblical scholars at least as far back as Origen (AD200) have seen to be unworkable and unnecessary. The reason why people turn toit now seems to be that the only obvious alternative story – evolution – hasbecome linked with a view of human psychology which they rightly think bothfalse and immoral.The second, rather subtler, confusion is what generates the tangle of myths anddramas we have been considering in this book – a tangle of which sociobiology,the element so far most noticed, is only a part. In these myths, Spencerismemerges as a whole, containing many seductive elements which have made thecrude, depressing, unconvincing psychology seem acceptable. The confident visionof future glory, and of a destiny central to the cosmos, is a sweetener whichmakes everything else easy to swallow.This use of a dazzling future to distract believers from the present, thusexcusing immediate crimes and confusions, is something Spencerism shares withmany forms of Marxism, Nietzscheism and Christianity. Among these, Spencerismdiffers in having had for a time the advantage of actually producing instalmentson its heaven in the form of aeroplanes, guns and TV sets. Good arguments,however, are something it is still uncommonly short of, and the trouble with amyth of progress is that its existing successes always lead to a demand formore. The gap between promise and performance is widening; cognitive dissonanceis beginning to set in. I think this is a very serious element in the malaise ofthe present day. It is extremely urgent to try and adapt our thoughtsrealistically to a world which has no fixed general direction either upward ordownward, but which is likely to vary largely according to what we do.When the light of criticism is turned on these current myths, it may perhapsemerge that there is less difference between the two kinds of confusion justmentioned than at first appears. Both creationism and Spencerism seem radicallyto confuse the functions of religion and science, attempting to produce anamalgam which will do the work of both. In doing so, both seem to distort notjust the province which they are trying to take over, but also the one in whosename they want to make the conquest. Much more attention is needed to themeaning of these abstractions. And it ought to emerge as part of the widerrethinking through which we have to forge ourselves a new world-picture.This cannot be done quickly. It needs long and careful work to get us clearabout the mistakes which our present picture incorporates without throwing awaythose parts of the truth which it does convey. I think it is best to end thisbook by making some attempt to put individualism into perspective. This seems tobe the element in our currently accepted morality which does most to make thequasi-scientific myths we have been discussing look plausible. Its limitationsgo a long way both to support egoism and to make us feel justified, as humans,in neglecting the rest of the biosphere. It has also, in its hypertrophied form,generated the crazy concepts of freedom which power the visions of Monod andRichard Dawkins. Accordingly, the philosophy on which it rests had better beconsidered in our last chapter."},{"pageContent":" 18 The Vulnerable World and its Claims on usEnvironmentalists, churches, politicians and science, all are concerned aboutthe damage to the environment. But their concern is for the good of humankind.So deep is this introspection that even now, few apart from eccentrics reallycare about other living organisms.James LovelockIs Meanness always Rational?Had Robinson Crusoe any duties on his island?When I was a philosophy student, this used to be a familiar conundrum, which wassupposed to pose a very simple question: namely, can you have duties toyourself? Mill, they correctly told us, said no. ‘The term duty to oneself, whenit means anything more than prudence, means self-respect or self-development andfor none of these is anyone accountable to his fellow-creatures.’1[22_Notes.html#fn-c18_en1] Kant, on the other hand, said yes. ‘Duties toourselves are of primary importance and should have pride of place … nothing canbe expected of a man who dishonours his own person.’2 [22_Notes.html#fn-c18_en2]There is a serious disagreement here, not to be sneezed away just by saying ‘itdepends on what you mean by duty’. Much bigger issues are involved. But quitehow big has, I think, not yet been fully realized. To grasp this, I suggest thatwe rewrite a part of Crusoe’s story, so as to bring in sight a different rangeof concerns, thus:Sept. 19, 1685. This day I set aside to devastate my island. My pinnace beingnow ready on the shore, and all things prepared for my departure, Friday’speople also expecting me, and the wind blowing fresh away from my littleharbour, I had in mind to see how all would burn. So then, setting sparks andpowder craftily among certain dry spinneys which I had chosen, I soon had itablaze, nor was there left, by the next dawn, any green stick among the ruins.Now, work on the style how you will, you cannot make that into a convincingparagraph. Crusoe was not the most scrupulous of men, but he would have felt aninvincible objection to this senseless destruction. So would the rest of us. Yetthe language of our moral tradition has tended strongly, ever since theEnlightenment, to make that objection unstateable. All the terms which expressthat a claim is serious or binding – duty, right, law, morality, obligation,justice – have been deliberately narrowed in their use so as to apply onlywithin the framework of contract, to describe only relations holding betweenfree and rational agents. Since it has been decided a priori that rationalityhas no degrees and that cetaceans are not rational, it follows that, unless youtake either religion or science fiction seriously, we can only have duties tohumans, and sane, adult, fully responsible humans at that.Now the morality we live by certainly does not accept this restriction. Incommon life we recognize many other duties as serious and binding, though ofcourse not necessarily overriding. If philosophers want to call these somethingelse instead of ‘duties’, they must justify their move. We have here one ofthese clashes between the language of common morality (which is of course alwaysto some extent confused and inarticulate) and an intellectual scheme which arosein the first place from a part of that morality, but has now taken offon its ownand claims authority to correct other parts of its source.There are always real difficulties here. As ordinary citizens we have to guardagainst dismissing such intellectual schemes too casually; we have to do justiceto the point of them. But as philosophers, we have to resist the oppositetemptation of taking the intellectual scheme as decisive, just because it iselegant and satisfying, or because the moral insight which is its starting-pointis specially familiar to us.Today, this intellectualist bias is often expressed by calling the insights ofcommon morality mere ‘intuitions’. This is quite misleading, since it gives theimpression that they have been reached without thought, and that there is, bycontrast, a scientific solution somewhere else to which they ought to bow asthere might be if we were contrasting commonsense ‘intuitions’ about thephysical world with physics or astronomy. Even when they do not use that word,however, philosophers often manage to give the impression that whenever ourmoral views clash with any simple, convenient scheme, it is our duty to abandonthem. Thus the philosopher G. R. Grice:It is an inescapable consequence of the thesis presented in these pages thatcertain classes cannot have natural rights: animals, the human embryo, futuregenerations, lunatics and children under the age of, say, ten. In the case ofyoung children at least, my experience is that this consequence is found hard toaccept. But it is a consequence of the theory; it is, I believe, true; and Ithink we should be willing to accept it. At first sight it seems a harshconclusion, but it is not nearly so harsh as it appears.3[22_Notes.html#fn-c18_en3]But it is in fact extremely harsh, since what he is saying is that the treatmentof children ought not to be determined by their interests, but by the interestsof the surrounding adults capable of contract, which of course can easilyconflict with them.In our own society, he explains, this does not actually make much difference,because parents here are so benevolent that they positively want to benefittheir children; and accordingly here ‘the interests of children are reflected inthe interests of the parents’. But this, he adds, is just a contingent factabout us. ‘It is easy to imagine a society where this is not so’, where, thatis, parents are entirely exploitative. ‘In this circumstance, the morallycorrect treatment of children would no doubt be harsher than it is in oursociety. But the conclusion has to be accepted.’ Grice demands that we withdrawour objections to harshness, in deference to theoretical consistency. But‘harsh’ here does not mean just ‘brisk and bracing’ like cold baths and a plaindiet. (There might well be more of those where parents do feel bound to considertheir children’s interests.) It means unjust.Our objection to unbridled parental selfishness is not a mere matter of tone ortaste; it is a moral one. It therefore requires a moral answer, an explanationof the contrary value which the contrary theory expresses. Grice and those whoargue like him take the ascetic, disapproving tone of people who have alreadydisplayed such a value, and who are met by a slovenly reluctance to rise to it.But they have not displayed that value. The ascetic tone cannot be justifiedmerely by an appeal to consistency. An ethical theory which, when consistentlyfollowed through, has iniquitous consequences is a bad theory and must bechanged. Certainly we can ask whether these consequences really are iniquitous;but this question must be handled seriously. We cannot directly conclude thatthe consequences cease to stink the moment they are seen to follow from ourtheory.Sociality and Social ContractsThe theoretical model which has spread blight in this area is, of course, thatof social contract, to fit which the whole cluster of essential moral termswhich I mentioned – right, duty, justice and the rest – has been progressivelynarrowed. This model shows human society as a spread of standard social atoms,originally distinct and independent, each of which combines with others only atits own choice and in its own private interest. This model is drawn fromphysics, and from seventeenth century physics at that, where the ultimateparticles of matters were conceived as hard, impenetrable, homogeneous littlebilliard-balls, with no hooks or internal structure. To see how such atoms couldcombine at all was very hard. Physics, accordingly, moved on from this notion toone which treats atoms and other particles as complex items, describable mainlyin terms of forces, and those the same kind of forces which operate outsidethem. It has abandoned the notion of ultimate, solitary, independentindividuals.Social-contract theory, however, retains it. On this physical – orarchaeophysical – model, all significant moral relations between individuals arethe symmetrical ones expressed by contract. If, on the other hand, we use abiological or ‘organic’ model, we can talk also of a variety of asymmetricalrelations found within a whole. Leaves relate not only to other leaves, but tofruit, twigs, branches and the whole tree. People appear not only asindividuals, but as members of their groups, families, tribes, species,ecosystems and biosphere, and have moral relations, as parts, to these variouswholes.The choice between these two ways of thinking is not, of course, a simpleonce-for-all affair. Different models are useful for different purposes. We can,however, reasonably point out, first, that the old physical pattern makes allattempts to explain combination extremely difficult. Second, that since humanbeings actually are living creatures, not crystals or galaxies, it is reasonableto expect that biological ways of thinking will be useful in understanding them.In its own sphere, the social-contract model has of course been of enormousvalue. Where we deal with clashes of interest between free and rational agentsalready in existence, and particularly where we want to disentangle a few ofthem from some larger group which really does not suit them, it isindispensable. And for certain political purposes during the last threecenturies these clashes have been vitally important. An obsession withcontractual thinking and a conviction that it is a cure-all are thereforeunderstandable. But the trouble with such obsessions is that they distort thewhole shape of thought and language in a way which makes them self-perpetuating,and constantly extends their empire. Terms come to be defined in a way whichleaves only certain moral views expressible. This can happen without any clearintention on the part of those propagating them, and even contrary to theiroccasional declarations, simply from mental inertia.Thus, John Rawls, having devoted most of his long book to his very subtle andexhaustive contractual view of justice, remarks without any special emphasisnear the end that, ‘We should recall here the limits of a theory of justice. Notonly are many aspects of morality left aside, but no account can be given ofright conduct in regard to animals and the rest of nature.’4[22_Notes.html#fn-c18_en4]He concedes that these are serious matters.Certainly it is wrong to be cruel to animals and the destruction of a wholespecies can be a great evil. The capacity for feelings of pleasure and pain andfor the forms of life of which animals are capable clearly impose duties ofcompassion and humanity in their case.All this is important, he says, and it calls for a wider metaphysical enquiry,but it is not his subject. Earlier in the same passage he touches on thequestion of permanently irrational human beings, and remarks that it ‘maypresent a difficulty. I cannot examine this problem here, but I assume that theaccount of equality would not be materially affected.’Won’t it though? It is a strange project to examine a single virtue – justice –without at least sketching in one’s view of the vast background of generalmorality which determines its shape and meaning, including, of course, suchawkward and non-contractual virtues as ‘compassion and humanity’. It isolatesthe duties which people owe each other merely as thinkers from those deeper andmore general ones which they owe each other as beings who feel. It cannot,therefore, fail both to split man’s nature and to isolate him from the rest ofthe creation to which he belongs. Such an account may not be Hamlet without theprince, but it is Hamlet with half the cast missing, and without the state ofDenmark. More exactly, it is like a history of Poland which regards Russia,Germany, Europe and the Roman Church as not part of its subject.I am not attacking John Rawls’s account on its own ground. I am simply pointingout what the history of ethics shows all too clearly – how much our thinking isshaped by what our sages omit to mention. The Greek philosophers never reallyraised the problem of slavery till towards the end of their epoch, and then fewof them did so with conviction. This happened even though it lay right in thepath of their enquiries into political justice and the value of the individualsoul. Christianity did raise that problem, because its social background wasdifferent, and because the world was in the Christian era already in turmoil, sothat men were not presented with the narcotic of happy stability. ButChristianity itself did not, until quite recently, seriously face the problem ofthe morality of punishment, and particularly of eternal punishment.This failure to raise central questions was not in either case complete. One canfind very intelligent and penetrating criticisms of slavery occurring from timeto time in Greek writings – even in Aristotle’s defence of that institution.5[22_Notes.html#fn-c18_en5] But they are mostly like Rawls’s remark here. Theyconclude ‘this should be investigated some day’. The same thing happens withChristian writings concerning punishment, except that the consideration ‘this isa great mystery’ acts as an even more powerful paralytic to thought. Not muchmore powerful, however. Natural inertia, when it coincides with vested interestor the illusion of vested interest, is as strong as gravitation.Rights and DutiesIt is important that Rawls does not (like Grice) demand that we toe a line whichwould make certain important moral views impossible. Like Hume, who similarlyexcluded animals from justice, he simply leaves them out of his discussion. Thismove ought in principle to be harmless. But when it is combined with an intenseconcentration of discussion on contractual justice, and a corresponding neglectof compassion and humanity, it inevitably suggests that the excluded problemsare relatively unimportant.This suggestion is still more strongly conveyed by rulings which exclude thenon-human world from rights, duties and morality. Words like rights and dutiesare awkward because they do indeed have narrow senses approximating to thelegal, but they also have much wider ones in which they cover the whole moralsphere. To say ‘They do not have rights’ or ‘You do not have duties to them’conveys to any ordinary hearer a very simple message, namely, ‘They do notmatter.’ This is an absolution, a removal of blame for ill-treatment of ‘them’,whoever they may be.To see how strong this informal, moral usage of ‘rights’ is, we need only lookat the history of that powerful notion, ‘the Rights of Man’. These rights werenot supposed to be ones conferred by law, since the whole point of appealing tothem was to change laws so as to embody them. They were vague, but vast. Theydid not arise, as rights are often said to do, only within a community, sincethey were taken to apply in principle everywhere. The immense, and on the wholecoherent, use which has been made of this idea by reforming movements showsplainly that the tension between the formal and the informal idea of right ispart of the word’s meaning, a fruitful connection of thought, not just amistake. It is therefore hard to adopt effectively the compromise which somephilosophers now favour, of saying that it is indeed wrong to treat animals incertain ways, but that we have no duties to them or that they have no rights.6[22_Notes.html#fn-c18_en6] ‘Animal rights’ may be hard to formulate, as indeedare the rights of man. But ‘no rights’ will not do.7 [22_Notes.html#fn-c18_en7]The word may need to be dropped entirely.The compromise is still harder with the word duty, which is rather moreinformal, and is more closely wedded to a private rather than political use.Where the realm of right and duty stops, there, to ordinary thinking, begins therealm of the optional. What is not a duty may be a matter of taste, style orfeeling, of aesthetic sensibility, of habit and nostalgia, of etiquette andlocal custom; but it cannot be something which demands our attention whether welike it or not. When claims get into this area, they can scarcely be takenseriously.This becomes clear when Kant tries to straddle the border. He says that we haveno direct duties to animals, because they are not rational, but that we shouldtreat them properly all the same because of ‘indirect duties’ which are reallyduties to our own humanity.8 [22_Notes.html#fn-c18_en8] This means thatill-treating them might lead us to ill-treat humans, and is also a sign of a bador inhumane disposition.The whole issue thus becomes a contingent one of spiritual style or training,like contemplative exercises, intellectual practice, or indeed refined manners.9[22_Notes.html#fn-c18_en9] Some might need practice of this kind to make themkind to people; others might not and indeed might get on better without it.(Working off one’s ill-temper on animals might make one treat people better.)But the question of cruelty to animals cannot be like this, because it is of theessence of such training exercises that they are internal. Anything that affectssome other being is not just practice, it is real action. Anyone who refrainedfrom cruelty merely from a wish not to sully his own character, without anydirect consideration for the possible victims, would be frivolous andnarcissistic.Trivializing CompassionA similar trivialization follows where theorists admit duties of compassion andhumanity to non-contractors, but deny duties of justice. Hume and Rawls, inmaking this move, do not explicitly subordinate these other duties, or say thatthey are less binding. But because they make the contract element so central tomorality, this effect seems to follow. The priority of justice is expressed insuch everyday proverbs as ‘Be just before you’re generous’. We are thereforerather easily persuaded to think that compassion, humanity and so forth areperhaps emotional luxuries, to be indulged only after all debts are paid.A moment’s thought will show that this is wrong. Someone who receivessimultaneously a request to pay a debt and another to comfort somebody bereavedor on their death-bed is not, as a matter of course, under obligation to pay thedebt first. He has to look at circumstances on both sides; but in general weshould probably expect the other duties to have priority. This is still moretrue if, on his way to pay the debt, he encounters a stranger in real straits,drowning or lying injured in the road. To give the debt priority, we probablyneed to think of his creditor as also being in serious trouble – which bringscompassion and humanity in on both sides of the case.What makes it so hard to give justice a different clientele from the othervirtues – as Hume and Rawls do – is simply the fact that justice is such apervading virtue. In general, all serious cases of cruelty, meanness, inhumanityand the like are also cases of injustice. If we are told that a certain set ofthese cases does not involve injustice, our natural thought is that these casesmust be trivial. Officially, Hume’s and Rawls’s restriction is not supposed tomean this. What, however, is it supposed to mean? It is forty years since Ifirst read David Hume’s text, and I find his thought as obscure now as I didthen. I well remember double-taking then, and going back over the paragraph fora point which I took it I must have missed. Can anyone see it?Were there [Hume says] a species of creature intermingled with men, which,though rational, were possessed of such inferior strength, both of body andmind, that they were incapable of all resistance, and could never, upon thehighest provocation, make us feel the effects of their resentment; the necessaryconsequence, I think, is that we should be bound by the laws of humanity to givegentle usage to these creatures, but should not, properly speaking, lie underany restraint of justice with regard to them, nor could they possess any rightor property, exclusive of such arbitrary lords. Our intercourse with them couldnot be called society, which supposes a degree of equality, but absolute commandon one side and servile obedience on the other. This is plainly the situation ofmen with regard to animals.10 [22_Notes.html#fn-c18_en10]I still think that the word justice, so defined, has lost its normal meaning. Inordinary life we think that duties of justice become more pressing, not less so,when we are dealing with the weak and inarticulate, who cannot argue back. It isthe boundaries of prudence which depend on power, not those of justice.Historically, Hume’s position becomes more understandable when one sees itsplace in the development of social-contract thinking. The doubtful credit forconfining justice to the human species seems to belong to Grotius, who finallymanaged to ditch the Roman notion of ius naturale, natural right or law commonto all species. I cannot here discuss his remarkably unimpressive arguments forthis.11 [22_Notes.html#fn-c18_en11] The point I want to make here is simply theeffect of these restrictive definitions of terms like justice on people’s viewof the sheer size of the problems raised by what falls outside them.A Vaster SceneWriters who treat morality as primarily contractual tend to discussnon-contractual cases briefly, casually and parenthetically, as though they wererather rare. (Rawls’s comments on the problem of mental defectives are entirelytypical here.) We have succeeded, they say, in laying most of the carpet; whyare you making this fuss about those little wrinkles behind the sofa?This treatment confirms a view, already suggested by certain aspects ofcontemporary politics in the United States, that those who fail to clock in asnormal rational agents and make their contracts are just occasional exceptions,constituting one more ‘minority’ group – worrying no doubt to the scrupulous,but not a central concern of any society. Let us, then, glance briefly at theirscope, by roughly listing some cases which seem to involve us in non-contractualduties. (The order is purely provisional and the numbers are added just forconvenience.)Human Sector 1. The dead 2. Posterity 3. Children 4. The senile 5. The temporarily insane 6. The permanently insane 7. Defectives, ranging down to ‘human vegetables’ 8. Human embryos Animal Sector 9. Sentient animals 10. Non-sentient animals Inanimate Sector 11. Plants of all kinds 12. Artefacts, including works of art 13. Inanimate but structured objects – crystals, rivers, rocks, etc. Comprehensive 14. Unchosen human groups of all kinds, including families, villages, cities and the species 15. Unchosen multi-species groups, such as ecosystems, forests and countries 16. The biosphere Miscellaneous 17. Arts and sciences 18. Oneself 19. GodNo doubt I have missed a few, but that will do to go on with.The point is this. If we look only at a few of these groupings, and withoutgiving them full attention, it is easy to think that we can include one or twoas honorary contracting members, by a slight stretch of our conceptual scheme,and find arguments for excluding the others from serious concern entirely. Butif we keep our eye on the size of the range, this stops being plausible.As far as sheer numbers go, this is no minority of the beings with whom we haveto deal. We are a small minority of them. As far as importance goes, it iscertainly possible to argue that some of these sorts of being should concern usmore and others less; we need a priority system. But to build it, moralarguments are required. The various kinds of claims have to be understood andcompared, not written off in advance. We cannot rule that those who, in our ownand other cultures, suppose that there is a direct objection to injuring ordestroying some of them, are always just confused, and mean only, in fact, thatthis item will be needed for rational human consumption.The blank antithesis which Kant made between rational persons (having value) andmere things (having none) cannot serve us to map out this vast continuum. Andthe idea that, starting at some given point on this list, we have a generallicence for destruction, is itself a moral view which would have to bejustified.Our culture differs from most others in the breadth of destructive licence whichit does allow itself, and from the seventeenth century onwards, that licence hasbeen greatly extended. Scruples about rapine have been continually dismissed asirrational, but it is not always clear what the rational principles are supposedto be with which they conflict. Western destructiveness has not in factdeveloped in response to a new set of disinterested intellectual principles,demonstrating the need for more people and fewer redwoods, but mainly as aby-product of greed and increasing commercial confidence.Humanistic hostility to superstition has certainly played some part in theprocess, because respect for the non-human items on our list is often taken tobe religious. But it does not have to be. Many scientists who are card-carryingatheists can still see the point of preserving the biosphere. So can the rest ofus, religious or otherwise. It is the whole of which we are parts, and its otherparts concern us for that reason.But the language of rights is rather ill-suited for expressing this, because ithas been developed mainly for the protection of people who, though oppressed,are in principle articulate. This makes it quite reasonable for theorists to saythat rights belong only to those who understand them and can claim them. Whenconfronted with the Human sector of our list, these theorists can either digthemselves in like Grice and exclude the lot, or stretch the scheme like Rawls,by including the hypothetical rational choices which these honorary memberswould make if they were not unfortunately prevented.Since many of these people seem less rational than many animals, zoophiles likePeter Singer have then a good case for calling this second device arbitrary andspecious, and extending rights to the border of sentience.12[22_Notes.html#fn-c18_en12] Here, however, the meaning of the term does becomethin, and when we reach the inanimate area, usage will scarcely cover it.13[22_Notes.html#fn-c18_en13] There may be a point in campaigning to extend usage.But to me it seems wiser on the whole not to waste energy on this verbal point,but instead to insist on the immense variety of kinds of being with which wehave to deal. Once we grasp this, we ought not to be surprised that we areinvolved in many different kinds of claim or duty. The dictum that ‘rights andduties are correlative’ is quite misleading, because the two words keepdifferent company, and one may be narrowed without affecting the other.The Problem of Self-RespectWhat, then, about duties? I believe that this term can properly be used over thewhole range. We have quite simply got many kinds of duties, including those toanimals, to plants and to the biosphere. But to speak in this way we must freethe term once and for all from its restrictive contractual use, or irrelevantdoubts will still haunt us. If we cannot do this, we shall have to exclude theword duty, along with right (as a noun) from all detailed discussion, usingwider words like wrong, right (adjectival) and ought instead. This gymnasticwould be possible but inconvenient.The issue about duty becomes clear as soon as we look at the controversy fromwhich I started, between Kant’s and Mill’s views on duties to oneself. What dowe think about this? Are there duties of integrity, autonomy, self-knowledge,self-respect? It seems that there are.Mill was right, of course, to point out that they are not duties to someone inthe ordinary sense. The divided self is a metaphor. It is as natural andnecessary a metaphor here as it is over, say, self-deception or self-control;but it certainly is not literal truth. The form of the requirement is different.Rights, for instance, certainly do not seem to come in here as they often wouldwith duties to other persons; we shall scarcely say, ‘I have a right to my ownrespect.’ And the kind of things which we can owe ourselves are distinctive. Itis not just chance whom they they are owed to. You cannot owe it to somebodyelse, as you can to yourself, to force him to act freely or with integrity. Heowes that to himself; the rest of us can only remove outside difficulties.As Kant justly said, our business is to promote our own perfection and thehappiness of others; the perfection of others is an aim which belongs to them.14[22_Notes.html#fn-c18_en14] Respect indeed we owe both to ourselves and toothers, but Kant may well be right to say that self-respect is really adifferent and deeper requirement, something without which all outward dutieswould become meaningless. (This may explain the paralysing effect ofdepression.)Duties to oneself, in fact, are duties with a different form. They are far lessclose than outward duties to the literal model of debt, especially money debt.Money is a thing which can be owed in principle to anybody; it is the samewhoever you owe it to; and if by chance you come to owe it to yourself, the debtvanishes. Not many of our duties are really of this impersonal kind; the attemptto commute other sorts of duty into money is a notorious form of evasion.Utilitarianism, however, wants to make all duties as homogeneous as possible,and that is the point of Mill’s position. He views all our self-concerningmotives as parts of the desire for happiness. Therefore he places all duty,indeed, all morality, in the outside world, as socially required restriction ofthat desire – an expression, that is, of other people’s desire for happiness.We do not call anything wrong, unless we mean that a person ought to be punishedin some way or another for doing it; if not by law, by the opinion of hisfellow-creatures; if not by opinion, by the reproaches of his own conscience.This seems the real turning-point of the distinction between morality and simpleexpediency. It is a part of the notion of Duty in every one of its forms, that aperson may rightly be compelled to fulfil it. Duty is a thing which may beexacted from a person, as one exacts a debt.15 [22_Notes.html#fn-c18_en15]But to make the notion of wrongness depend on punishment and public opinion inthis way instead of the other way round is wild.Mill never minded falling flat on his face from time to time in trying out a newnotion for the public good. He did it for us here – and we should, I think, takeproper advantage of his generosity, and accept the impossibility which hedemonstrates. The concepts cannot be connected up this way round. Unless youthink of certain facts as wrong, it makes no sense to talk of punishment.‘Punishing’ alcoholics with aversion therapy, or experimental rats with electricshocks, is not really punishing at all; it is just deterrence. This ‘punishment’will not make their previous actions wrong, nor has it anything to do withmorality.The real point of morality returns into Mill’s scheme in the Trojan horse of‘the reproaches of his own conscience’. Why do they matter? Unless theconscience is talking sense – that is, on Utilitarian principles, unless it isdelivering the judgment of society – it should surely be silenced? Mill, himselfa man of enormous integrity and deeply concerned about autonomy, would neverhave agreed to silence it. But unless we do so, we shall have to complicate hisscheme.It may well be true that, in the last resort and at the deepest level,conscience and the desire for happiness converge. We do want to be honest. Butin ordinary life and at the everyday level they can diverge amazingly. We do notwant to be put out. What we know we ought to do is often most unwelcome to us,which is why we call it duty. And whole sections of that duty do not concernother people directly at all.A good example is the situation in Brave New World where a few dissidentcitizens have grasped the possibility of a fuller and freer life. Nobody elsewants this. Happiness is already assured. If there is a duty of change here, itmust be first of all that of each to himself. True, they may feel bound also tohelp others to change, but hardly in a way which those others would exact. Infact, we may do better here by dropping the awkward second party altogether andsaying that they all have a duty of living differently – one which will affectboth themselves and others, but which does not require, as a debt does, a namedperson or people to whom it must be paid. Wider models like ‘the whole duty ofman’ may be more relevant.This one example from my list will, I hope, be enough to explain the point. Icannot go through all of them, nor ought it to be necessary. Duties need not bequasi-contractual relations holding between symmetrical pairs of rational humanagents. There are all kinds of other obligations holding between asymmetricalpairs, or involving, as in this case, no outside beings at all.To speak of duties to things in the inanimate and comprehensive sectors of mylist is not necessarily to personify them superstitiously, or to indulge inchatter about ‘the secret of life of plants’.16 [22_Notes.html#fn-c18_en16] Itexpresses merely that there are suitable and unsuitable ways of behaving ingiven situations. People have duties as farmers, parents, consumers,forest-dwellers, colonists, species-members, ship-wrecked mariners, tourists,potential ancestors and actual descendants, etc. As such, it is the business ofeach not to forget his transitory and dependent position, the rich gifts whichhe has received, and the tiny part he plays in a vast, irreplaceable and fragilewhole.It is remarkable that we nowadays have to state this obvious truth as if it werenew, and invent words like ‘ecological’ to describe a whole vast class ofduties. Most peoples are used to the idea. In stating it, and getting it backinto the centre of our moral stage, we meet various difficulties, of which themost insidious is possibly the temptation to feed this issue as fuel tolong-standing controversies about religion. Is concern for the non-human aspectsof our biosphere necessarily superstitious and therefore to be resistedtooth-and-nail?I have pointed out that it need not be religious at all. Certified rejectors ofall known religions can share it. No doubt there is a wider sense in which anydeep and impersonal concern can be called religious – one in which Marxism alsois a religion. No doubt too all such deep concerns have their dangers, butcertainly the complete absence of them has worse ones. Moreover, anyone wishingabove all to avoid the religious dimension should consider that the intenseindividualism which has focused our attention exclusively on the social-contractmodel is itself thoroughly mystical. It has glorified the individual human soulas an object having infinite and transcendent value, has hailed it as the onlyreal creator, and has bestowed on it much of the panoply of God.Nietzsche, who was responsible for much of this new theology,17[22_Notes.html#fn-c18_en17] took over from the old Thomistic theology which heplundered the assumption that all the rest of creation mattered only as a framefor man. This is not an impression which any disinterested observer would getfrom looking round at it, nor do we need it in order to take our destinysufficiently seriously.The Island’s ClaimRobinson Crusoe then, I conclude, did have duties concerning his island, andwith the caution just given we can reasonably call them duties to it.They were not very exacting, and were mostly negative. They differed, of course,from those which a long-standing inhabitant of a country has. Here the languageof fatherland and motherland, which is so widely employed, indicates rightly aduty of care and responsibility which can go very deep, and which long-settledpeople commonly do feel strongly. To insist that it is really only a duty to theexploiting human beings is not consistent with the emphasis often given toreverence for the actual trees, mountains, lakes, rivers and the like which arefound there. A decision to inhibit all this rich area of human love is a specialmanoeuvre for which reasons would need to be given, not a dispassionate analysisof existing duties and feelings.What happens, however, when you are shipwrecked on an entirely strange island?As the history of colonization shows, there is a tendency for people so placedto drop any reverence and become more exploitative. But it is not irresistible.Raiders who settle down can quite soon begin to feel at home, as the Vikings didin East Anglia, and can after a while become as possessive, proud and protectivetowards their new land as old inhabitants. Crusoe from time to time shows thispride rather touchingly, and it would, I think, certainly have inhibited anymoderate temptation such as that which I mentioned to have a good bonfire. Whatkeeps him sane through his stay, however, is in fact his duty to God. If thathad been absent, I should rather suppose that sanity would depend on a strongerand more positive attachment to the island itself and its creatures.It is interesting, however, that Crusoe’s story played its part in developingthat same unrealistic, icy individualism which has gone so far towards makingboth sorts of attachment seem corrupt or impossible. Rousseau delighted inDefoe’s Robinson Crusoe, and praised it as the only book fit to be given to achild, not because it showed a man in his true relation to animal and vegetablelife, but because it was the bible of individualism.The surest way to raise him [the child] above prejudice and to base hisjudgments on the true relations of things, is to put him in the place of asolitary man, and to judge all things as they would be judged by such a man inrelation to their own utility… . So long as only bodily needs are recognised,man is self-sufficing … the child knows no other happiness but food andfreedom!18 [22_Notes.html#fn-c18_en18]That false atomic notion of human psychology – a prejudice above which nobodyever raised Rousseau – is the flaw in all social-contract thinking. If he wereright, every member of the human race would need a separate island, and heavenknows what our ecological problems would be then.Perhaps, after all, we had better count our blessings."},{"pageContent":"NOTES1 Evolutionary Dramas1 [04_Chapter1.html#c01_en1] Jacques Monod, Chance and Necessity, trans.Austryn Wainhouse (London, Fontana, 1974), p. 160.2 [04_Chapter1.html#c01_en2] M.

Even at its most extreme, however, the theory neverlicensed the view that it would be possible to stop studying subjects likehistory by their own peculiar methods.

The phrase is probably more useful as a slogan, indicating a generaldirection, than as a detailed conceptual tool.14 [21_Chapter18.html#c18_en14] Kant, ‘Preface to the metaphysical elements ofethics’, Introduction to Ethics, chs 4 [07_Chapter4.html#chapter4] and 5[08_Chapter5.html#chapter5].15 [21_Chapter18.html#c18_en15] J.

Attempts toduplicate these experiments have, however, failed entirely to produce anysimilar results. See A. W. Galson and C. L. Slayman, ‘The not so secret life ofplants’, American Scientist, 67, p. 337. It seems possible that the originalresults were due to a fault in the electrical apparatus.The attempt shows, I think, one of the confusions which continually arise frominsisting that all duties must be of the same form. We do not need to prove thatplants are animals in order to have reason to spare them. The point is welldiscussed by Marian Dawkins in her book Animal Suffering (London, Chapman &Hall, 1981), pp. 117–19.17 [21_Chapter18.html#c18_en17] See particularly Thus Spake Zarathustra, pt 3,‘Of old and new tables’, trans.
