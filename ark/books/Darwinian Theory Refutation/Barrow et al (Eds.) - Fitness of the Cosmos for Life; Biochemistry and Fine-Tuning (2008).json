WhitesidesHow did life begin?I(and most scientists) would answer, “By accident.” But what an absolutely unlikelyaccident it must have been! The earth on which life first appeared – prebioticearth – was most inhospitable: a violent place, wracked by storms and volcanoes,wrenched by the pull of a moon that was much closer than the one we know now, stillbattered by cosmic impacts. On its surface and in its oceans were myriads of organiccompounds, some formed in processes occurring on earth, some imported by infallsfrom space. Out of this universe of tumult and molecules, somehow a small subsetof chemical processes emerged and accidentally replicated, thus stumbling towardwhat became the first cells. How could such a chaotic mixture of molecules havegenerated cells? Order usually decays toward disorder:Why do the tracks that ledto life point in the opposite direction?The origin of life is one of the biggest of the big questions about the natureof existence.Origintends to occur frequently in these big questions: theoriginof the universe, theoriginof matter, theoriginof life, theoriginof sentience.We,scientists and non-scientists alike, have troubles with such “origins” – wewere not there watching when the first events happened, we can never replicatethem, and, when those first events happened, there was, in fact, no “we.” I believethat one day we will be able to describe life in physical terms – that is, we willrationalize life satisfactorily in molecular detail based on accepted scientific law andscientific theory using the scientific method. But we certainly do not know yet how todo it.Understanding how organized living cells emerged from disorganized mixturesof molecules is an entrancingly, seductively difficult problem – so difficult, aswe now understand it, that science does not even have well-formulated, testablehypotheses about how it might have happened, only guesses and intuitions. Thisxi"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"xiiFo rewordproblem deserves our most careful thought. Its solution will tell us about our originsand describe how disorder can spontaneously become order. It will also test thecapability of current science to understand systems comprising many interactingparts.Before trying to answer the questionHow did life begin?,wemust first thinkabout what the question really is that we are trying to answer: What is the “life”whose origins we are trying to understand? What are the characteristics of a cell,the simplest embodiment of life, that might allow us to trace back to its origins?How do we recognize an “origin”? When does a set of molecules, and of processesthat convert these molecules into one another, cross a line separating “not-alive”from “alive”? And what is the tool – the “scientific method” – that science will useto try to address this problem?Let us begin with the scientific method, a very useful and quite reliable strategyfor doing science. Although it sometimes seems plodding, the scientific method cantease apart astonishingly difficult and complicated problems by careful attentionto detail. It starts with rigorously reproducible empirical observations: “Things falldown, not up.” “Two objects at different temperatures, when placed in contact,reach the same temperature.” “Hydrogen atoms absorb only light that has specificfrequencies.” The scientific method codifies and quantifies these observations as“physical laws,” builds theories (Newtonian mechanics, thermodynamics, quantummechanics) based on those laws, and then tests new observations or hypotheses fortheir compatibility with these theories. Based on these theories, science rationalizesthe physical world and predicts aspects of it not previously observed. The tools of thescientific method are the millstones and the oven that science uses to grind obser-vations into theory and bake theory into prediction.The scientific method works most rigorously when it identifies observations thatare incompatible with current hypotheses. Faced with a new observation, scientistslist all hypotheses that might explain it and then discard those that are incompatiblewith accepted physical law. Hypotheses that are not discarded as incompatibleremain possibilities. If only one remains, it is promoted to theory. If disproving allhypotheses but one is not possible, we may retreat to demonstrating compatibilitywith theory, recognizing that compatibility is weaker than proof. In science, weuse the phrases “I think . . .” and “I believe . . .” as synonyms, both implying “. . .based on known physical law.” In other words, “This theory accommodates all theobservations that we currently know.”So, what is life? We can describe what it looks like and what it does, but nothow it works (most of us are in the same situation even with much simpler systems:computers, electric toothbrushes, refrigerator magnets). I suggest that life has fivemajor physical attributes (other scientists may suggest other lists, but the generalprinciples will usually be the same):"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Fo rewordxiii1.Life is compartmentalized.All life that we know is embodied in cells, and all cells haveacontinuous, closed membrane that separates “inside” from “outside.”2.Life is dissipative, or out-of-equilibrium.Life requires a flow of energy. If the chemicaland physical processes in living cells reach equilibrium, and there is no flux of energythrough the cell, it is, so far as we know, dead (or, at least, “not-alive”).3.Life is self-replicating.The most evident characteristic of the cell is that it wasproduced by the division of a parent cell, and, in many cases, it too will divide andproduce daughter cells.4.Life is adaptive.The cell can adapt its internal environment so that it functions evenwhen the outside environment changes; in some circumstances, it can even modify theoutside environment to make its inside more comfortable.5.Life occurs in water.All life, so far as we know, involves molecules and salts dissolvedor organized in a medium that is mostly water. We do not know whether water isessential to all life or just to life as we know it. But, at this time, we know noexceptions: life occurs in water.So, according to this view, life is a spatially distinct, highly organized network ofchemical reactions that occur in water and is characterized by a set of remarkableproperties that enable it to replicate itself and to adapt to changes in its environment.Wecan, thus, describe what we are still ignorant about, but not much more.How remarkable is life? The answer is:very.Those of us who deal in networks ofchemical reactions know of nothing like it. We understand some – but only some –of the characteristics of the network that make it so remarkable. One key to itsbehavior is catalysis. The rates of essentially all cellular reactions – the processesthat convert one molecule into another – are controlled by other molecules (usuallyby a class of protein catalysts called enzymes). The catalysts are (in some sense)like valves in a chemical plant (which, in some sense, is what a cell is): they controlthe rate at which one kind of molecule becomes another in a way loosely analogousto that in which a valve controls the rate at which fluid flows through a pipe. Thecomplexity of the network becomes clear when one realizes that the catalysts – thevalves – are themselves controlled by the molecules they produce: the products ofone reaction can control the rate at which another reaction takes place.The catalysts provide plausible connections among the elements of the network.The conversations among catalysts – conversations controlled by the very moleculesthe catalysts are controlling – allow the components of the network to form a single,coherent, interconnected, albeit very complicated, entity rather than an inchoatecollection of independent processes. And how intricate these “conversations” are!The molecules whose production is required for the cell to live and to replicateitself modify the activities of the catalysts that make them. These already verycomplex interactions are further modulated by additional signals that come fromoutside the cell and by signals generated by an internal “clock.” (This clock – the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xivFo reword“cell cycle” – is itself a set of chemical reactions that oscillates spontaneously intime and defines the sequence of stages through which the cell progresses as itreplicates.) Many molecules in the cell also have multiple roles: intermediates inone or many synthetic pathways, controllers of the activity of catalysts, signals forgenerating the catalysts and other molecules, sources of energy, and componentsof the physical structure of the cell.Today, we understand many aspects of the behavior of the cell and many frag-ments of the network, but not how it all fits together. We particularly do not under-stand the stability of life and of the networks that compose it. Our experience withother very complicated networks (e.g. the global climate, air-traffic-control sys-tems, the stock market) is that they are puzzlingly unstable and idiosyncratic. Butunlike these and other such networks, life is stable – it is able to withstand, or adaptto, remarkably severe external jolts and shocks; and its stability is even more puz-zling than the instability of the climate. We have a hard enough time understandingeven simple sets of coupled chemical reactions. And we have, at this time, no ideahow to understand (and certainly not how to construct) the network of reactionsthat make up the simplest cell.So, at least for now, the cell is beyond our ability to understand it. The commu-nity of people working on the nature of life has, nonetheless, great (and probablywarranted) confidence that understanding life in purely physical terms is a tractable,if difficult, problem. This confidence is enormously bolstered by two facts.First, we are surrounded by uncountable varieties of life, especially by multitudesof different types of living cells; we thus have many examples of different formsof life. We ourselves are communities of cells with the added complexities ofhierarchical organization of these cells into tissues, of tissues into organs, and oforgans into the organisms that are “we.”Second, the tools of modern molecular biology have given us an astonishingcapability to examine, modify, deconstruct, and reconstruct the molecular compo-nents of cells to see how they respond to our tinkering. The simplest cells (such asthose of the primitive intracellular parasiteMycoplasma genitalium)appear to havefewer than a thousand proteins. That number of catalysts is still very complicated,and we have as yet no conceptual tools for understanding a network of reactions ofsuch complexity. But this level of complexity does not, in principle, seem unreach-ably beyond our understanding. A cellular network of a thousand proteins (catalystsand molecules that sense, signal, and control passage across membranes; act as thestructural skeleton; and perform many other functions) talking to one another ingroups through the compounds they produce seems to be something that we willbe able to disentangle. Certainly, those who call themselves “systems biologists”believe we will. Still, the path that scientists are now following in trying to under-stand the molecular basis of life will test their creativity and strain their endurance:"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Fo rewordxvfirst, understanding the pieces of the networks as thoroughly as possible; then, per-haps, devising a computer model of a cell; and ultimately, in some distant future,validating the correctness of the principles suggested by this model by designing aset of reactions entirely different from those in the cells we now know.It is one thing to analyze a Bach fugue; it is quite a different thing to play one,or to write one, or to create the kind of communication between humans that wecall “music.” We shall, I confidently believe, eventually analyze the fugue of life –the interplay of metabolic processes in the cell – as a network of compartmental-ized, adaptive chemical reactions that can, astonishingly, replicate repeatedly intoidentical, distinct, separate networks. This is a very difficult job, but one that wehumans can accomplish. But where did the cell come from? How did this wonder-fully, astonishingly complex system come into existence? We do not know. If it isvery difficult to understand the operation of cellular life as we observe it today, itis even more difficult to understand how it might have originated in the past.Thoughtful, deeply creative people from a wide range of backgrounds havebeen captivated by the question of the origin of life. There is no shortage of ideasabout pieces of this puzzle. We know how the surfaces of minerals might haveprovided elementary, non-biological catalysts to start the process and how heat orsunlight might have contributed other reactions. We can guess why certain typesof molecules and reactions tend to occur in metabolism. We understand how anynumber of plausible natural events occurring in a conceivable prebiotic earth –events that formed complex mixtures of chemicals in geothermal vents, in lightning,on impacts, and under intense solar irradiation – might have contributed relevant bitsof chemistry. But we donotunderstand how something as subtle and complicated asthe network of reactions that we recognize the cell to be – a network both responsiveand robust – might have emerged from these rudimentary processes. How could achemical sludge spontaneously become a rose, even with billions of years to try?Wecan take two approaches in our research directed toward the origin of life:reasoningbackwardand reasoningforward.“Backward” starts with life as we knowand characterize it now – cells, DNA, RNA, enzymes, membranes, metabolites,membrane receptors, channels, and import/export proteins – and extrapolates backto simpler and simpler systems to try to infer an origin. This approach has beenspectacularly successful in “reverse engineering” evolution, at least part of the way;butithas always been guided by examples provided by the types of cells that arenow alive. Still, there seems little doubt that evolution could proceed once therewasaprimitive cell, with RNA or an RNA-like molecule, and reactions that usedRNA as a catalyst and also translated RNA into protein or protein-like catalysts thatwere part of the network of reactions. Several hundreds of millions of tidal pools,together with enormous volumes of lakes and oceans, over several hundreds ofmillions of years provided many opportunities to produce cellular and organismic"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"xviFo rewordcomplexity. This part of the development of the complexity of life no longer seemsto be a serious issue, at least conceptually. And the anatomical and physiologicalstructures that now so enthrall us – the eye, the ear, the kidney, tentacles, muscles –these all seem to me transfixingly interesting products of evolution, but not oneswhose origins are incomprehensibly improbable. If we and the squid have the samecamera eye, why not? With enough tries, “best” solutions are bound to emerge manytimes. If some creatures walk on two legs, some on four, some on six or eight –again, why not? Many solutions may work well enough to survive the rigors ofevolutionary selection.Reasoning “forward” is much more problematic. Although we can imagine manypossible mangers for the birth of life – deep smokers in the abyssal depths, tidalpools, hot springs, and many others – and although each could plausibly pro-duce primitive precursors to many of the reactions that now constitute cellularmetabolism, we have (in my opinion) no idea how these simple reactions mighthave blundered together to make the first protocell. Monkeys sitting at typewriterspecking out Shakespeare seems child’s play by comparison. For example, we stilldo not know:\u0001What were the first catalysts?Were they protein-analogs or RNA-analogs or minerals orsome other species of which there is now no trace?\u0001How did the first networks form, and why did they persist?One can imagine countlesscatalytic reactions that might have occurred, but how some of these reactions becameself-sustaining networks is entirely obscure.\u0001How could the process that stores the information that specifies the catalysts – the RNAor precursor of the primitive cells – have evolved?The connection between RNA (or itsyounger, more evolved cousin, DNA) and the proteins that are catalysts, the enzymes, isnot at all obvious; how the two co-evolved is even less clear.\u0001How did the energetic cycles that power every cell emerge?Why is there potassium ion onthe inside of the cell and sodium ion on the outside? What was the origin of chemiosmosis?Given the extraordinary complexity of the ATPases – the complicated aggregates ofproteins that generate ATP using the free energy that derives from differences in theconcentration of ions across membranes – how could they have evolved? We simply donot know.Nothing in the cell violates the fundamental laws of physical science. The secondlaw of thermodynamics, the law that describes everything that occurs in the rangeof sizes relevant to life, can sleep untroubled. The flux of energy – now (althoughnot necessarily originally) produced in nuclear reactions in our sun, transferred tothe surface of earth as sunlight, absorbed by plants in photosynthesis, captured asglucose and other compounds, used in the cell to generate the intermediates thatmake metabolism possible, and ultimately dissipated to space by radiation as heat –can evidently support life. But how life originated is simply not apparent. It seems"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Fo rewordxviiso improbable! The complexity of the simplest cell eludes our understanding –how could it be that any cell, even one simpler than the simplest that we know,emerged from the tangle of accidental reactions occurring in the molecular sludgethat covered the prebiotic earth? We (or, at least, I) do not understand. It is notimpossible, but it seems very, very improbable.This improbability is the crux of the matter. The scientific method can be par-alyzed by problems that require understanding the very improbable occurrencesthat result from very, very large numbers of throws of the dice. Sometimes we canunderstand the statistics of the problem; sometimes we cannot. How likely is it thatacomet will hit the earth? We now have good geological records. How likely is itthat a star will explode into a nova? There are many, many observable stars, andwe now understand the statistics of nova formation quite well.But how likely is it that a newly formed planet, with surface conditions thatsupport liquid water, will give rise to life? We have, at this time, no clue, andno convincing way of estimating. From what we do now know, the answer fallssomewhere between “impossibly unlikely” and “absolutely inevitable.” We cannotcalculate the odds of the spontaneous emergence of cellular life on a plausibleprebiotic earth in any satisfying and convincing way.What to do? For all its apparent improbability, life does seem to have happenedhere (or perhaps on some similar planet that transferred life to here). Rationalizingthe origin of life is a problem that chemists are probably best able to solve. Lifeis a molecular phenomenon. The possibilities of alternative universes and differentdistributions of the elements are irrelevant from the vantage point of the particularuniverse and planet – our earth – that we share with so many other forms of life. Weunderstand the chemical elements (we do not need to know about exotic forms ofmatter or energy in this enterprise), the molecules they form, and their reactivities.Weknow the players in the game, and we understand the game they play. Wecan guess (albeit only roughly) the distribution of the elements on the surface ofthe earth in the epoch in which we believe that life emerged, and we can inferthe abundances of the molecules that were probably present. We understand howcatalysts function. But we do not see how it all fits together.Is this a problem in which science can make progress? Yes, and perhaps no.Those researchers who have taken the approach of reasoning “backward” to inferhow life might have been born have made rapid progress. They have used the toolsof molecular biology to trace the early stages of evolution back to the point whereDNA gave way to RNA, which in turn probably gave way to some more primitivemolecule whose composition we don’t know, but which was probably related toRNA. The paths are fainter and fainter as the trail becomes older and colder andas we move from fact into speculation beyond RNA. We still do not understandthe connections between RNA, or its forgotten ancestor, and enzymes, or their"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"xviiiFo rewordalso forgotten ancestors, and the metabolic web that supports and constitutes life.Moving “forward” – spinning and weaving the threads that connect “molecules” to“life” – has been technically and conceptually more difficult.Still, compelling connections are apparent between what might have existed onthe prebiotic earth and the molecules of surprising complexity that are now vital tolife. We understand, for example, how molecules of astonishing sophistication, suchas the porphyrins – the precursors to the “green” of the pigments that serve plants inphotosynthesis and the “red” of the hemoglobin that transports oxygen in our blood –could have arisen from aqueous solutions of hydrogen cyanide, one of the simplest ofmolecules and a possible component of the atmosphere of prebiotic earth. But thesedemonstrations, marvelous as they are, do not bridge the gap between “forward”pathways from prebiotic molecules to life and “backward” pathways from moderncells to possible progenitors, those emerging from the gray area between “alive”and “not-alive.” As yet, no step goes from solutions of molecules to the networksof interconverting molecules that make up living cells. I believe that no one yetknows how to bridge that gap.How to progress? The best lead to the hardest part of the problem – the “forward”problem – is the hypothesis that life evolved, somehow, from autocatalytic reac-tions (that is, reactions whose products are themselves catalysts for the reactionsthat produce them). We know something about autocatalytic reactions: flames areautocatalytic, and so are explosions (and one speaks, sometimes, of the “explo-sion” of life). We also know other reactions that are autocatalytic, although thesubject of “autocatalysis” has not been a particular preoccupation of chemistry orbiochemistry. Autocatalysis offers, I believe, a plausible trail into the wilderness.Here, I suggest, is aprocessthat science can use to examine this question.Let us build and understand autocatalytic reactions; extend that understanding toother networks of catalytic reactions; and develop simple, and then more complex,networks of autocatalytic and catalytic reactions. If, in time, we can trace a pathwayfrom “chemical sludge” to “life,” we shall have provided an argument based onplausibility, if not on proof, for the origin of life.If, in time, we cannot trace such a path, what then? In science, until it has beenproven that something cannot be done, it is always possible that it can be done.Proving that life did not originate by accident in tidal pools or black smokers willbe more difficult than proving that it might have done so. Also, patience may be inorder. What is impossible for science today may be trivial for science in the future.There is still much that we do not understand about nature. As we learn more,Ibelieve that we will ultimately see a path – based on principles of chemistry andphysics and geology – that could plausibly have led from disorganized mixturesof inanimate chemicals to the astonishingly ordered, self-replicating networks ofreactions that provide the basis for life. The fact that I cannot yet understand how an"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Fo rewordxixinconceivably large number of tries at an extraordinarily improbable event mightlead to “life” is more a reflection of my limited ability to understand than evidenceof a requirement for some new principle. But, having said all of that, I do not know,and in some sense do not care, whether physical science as I now know it ultimatelyexplains the origin of life or whether the explanation will require principles entirelynew to me. I do care that science makes every effort to develop the explanation.Although I believe that science will ultimately be successful in rationalizing theorigin of life in terms of physical principles, it should be cautious and claim creditonly for the puzzles it has already solved, not those whose solutions still lie in thefuture. The central conundrum about the origin of life – that, as an accidental event,it seems so very improbable – is not one that science has yet resolved. Claimingcredit prematurely – claiming, in effect, that current science holds all the answers –may stunt the growth of the new ideas that a resolution may require.What, then, do I know? I know that I do not, yet, understand how life originated(and that I may not live long enough to do so). Order from disorder! How could ithave happened?Ialso know that my father never imagined cloning, and his father would not havebelieved television.

J. HendersonEverett MendelsohnCrane Brinton, Harvard historian, friend of Lawrence J. Henderson, and fellowmember of The Saturday Club, wrote the obituary for Henderson in the Club’sthird commemorative volume (Brinton,1958,p.207). Noting that Henderson wassomewhat out of the ordinary – crossing the Charles River on several occasions tokeep appointments at the Medical School (Boston) and the College (Cambridge)and then recrossing it to get to the Business School (Boston) – Brinton went onto note Henderson’s other non-traditional characteristics: “Ticketed as a biologicalchemist, he later took the titlephysiologistand, although he would not have likedthe name, at the end of his career he was asociologist[emphasis added].”Brinton went on: “A cross section of his publications may indeed be so drawnup as to seem an academic scandal.” Brinton ran through the publications, fromthe well-knownThe Fitness of the Environment(1913) andThe Order of Nature(1917); the more esotericOn the Excretion of Acid from the Animal Organism(1910, 1911); the simple volumeBlood: A Study in General Physiology(1928);the unexpected transcript of an interview on the experiments in the Liberty BreadShop (Brinton, 1958, p. 208); in his later life,The Study of Man(1941); toPareto’sGeneral Sociology: A Physiologist’s Interpretation(1935). Brinton jocularly addedthat a piece by Henderson – a biographical memoir on the life of the poet EdwinArlington Robinson (a close friend from his student days) written as a memoir forthe American Academy of Arts and Sciences – is to be found in the WoodberryPoetry Room of Harvard’s Lamont Library.ToBrinton, “the conclusion is inescapable: Henderson, who was so much else,was also a philosopher.” But Brinton also modified his praises: Henderson did nothave the gifts of a popularizer. He was not a polymath, despite his interests in manyareas. Nor was he a Renaissance figure; he had no interest in music or in the fineFitness of the Cosmos for Life: Biochemistry and Fine-Tuning,ed.

And – almost mockingly – Brinton noted Henderson’s very high regard for“the art of eating and drinking.”So who was this man whoseThe Fitness of the Environment, published someninety years before, was chosen as the emblem of the project,Fitness of the Cosmosfor Life?1Who was L. J. Henderson?Lawrence Joseph Henderson was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, an industrial cityjust north of Boston, on June 3, 1878. The son of a businessman, he received hisearly education in Salem, Massachusetts, the more upscale town of his father’sfamily, before going to Harvard as a sixteen-year-old – actually not that unusual inthe late nineteenth century. His father’s business connections in the St. Pierre andMiquelon Islands of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, where the young Henderson spenthis vacations, stimulated his interest in learning French.After graduating in 1898, he went on to Harvard Medical School, receiving hisM.D. degree in 1902 (although he never intended to be a physician). He followedthe path of those Americans interested in advanced scientific training by spendingtwo years in the Strasbourg (then in Germany) laboratory of the biochemist FranzHofmeister. After returning to Harvard, he spent a year in the chemistry laboratoryof Theodore W. Richards (his former teacher and later brother-in-law). In 1905, hewas appointed Lecturer in Biochemistry at the Harvard Medical School. He thenmoved to the college and, rising through the ranks, became a professor in 1919. In1934, he was appointed the Abbott and James Lawrence Professor of Chemistry, apost he held until his death on February 10, 1942.Henderson was a key figure in establishing the Department of Physical Chem-istry in the Medical School (1920), and seven years later he helped establish theFatigue Laboratory at the Graduate School of Business Administration. Togetherwith Alfred North Whitehead (whom he helped bring to Harvard) and PresidentAbbott Lawrence Lowell, he founded the Society of Fellows at Harvard. As early as1911, Henderson started teaching a general course in the history of science (one ofthe earliest in any university) and played an instrumental role in bringing the BelgianGeorge Sarton, the pre-eminent historian of science, to Harvard in 1916. He receivedthe obvious forms of scientific recognition, including election to the NationalAcademy of Sciences (becoming its Foreign Secretary) and the American Academyof Arts and Sciences, and was also decorated with the FrenchL ́egion d’honneur.But Henderson was not a good experimenter, did not like manipulating the com-plex apparatus of his field (he later confessed to this in his unpublished series1See www.templeton.org/biochem-finetuning/participants.html."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"1 Locating “fitness” and L. J. Henderson5of “Memories” [1936–39]), was judged by colleagues to be incapable of wri-ting or speaking simply, was known for making “passionate and intolerant asser-tions and suffered fools not at all.” He consciously took the role of gadfly, (oftenrudely) wanting to shake people out of their comfort zone and stimulate them torespond. Brinton noted that despite his warmth, which he hid from the world, heappeared to many as “a cold scientist, pompous, even pedantic” (Brinton,1958,pp. 211–12).Many of those who recounted episodes from Henderson’s life or who had encoun-ters with him noted special characteristics. His very fair-minded former student andcolleague John T. Edsall, the Harvard biochemist, noted in his entry on Hendersonin theDictionary of American Biographythathis mind and temperament were complex. Especially in his later years, he spoke often withintense distrust of “intellectuals,” liberals, and uplifters, who he felt failed to understand thedeep non-rational sentiments that are an essential foundation for a satisfactory and stablesociety...hecould infuriate some of his hearers...(Edsall,1973,p.352)George Homans, Harvard professor of sociology and young disciple of Hender-son’s later work on the social theorist Vilfredo Pareto, put it more bluntly in hisown autobiographical volume: “Henderson was always an extreme and outspo-ken conservative . . . his manner in conversation was feebly imitated by a piledriver” (Homans,1984,p.90). Or, as he put it in another context: “Hendersonnever lost his tastelessness” (p. 117). This, from a deep admirer of his work, a closeyounger colleague, and the co-author with Charles P. Curtis of a volume on Pareto’ssociology.Where didThe Fitness of the Environmentcome from and where did L. J. Hen-derson go with it? In spite of the several fields in which Henderson worked, anumber of commentators, his contemporaries, and later analysts noted a markedlysimilar approach in many of his endeavors. Looking back at his work later in life,Henderson himself noted more unity than he had been aware of at the time. Hisfocus was on organization and system: the organism, the universe, and society. JohnParascandola, the author of a doctoral dissertation and several important articles onHenderson, put it succinctly: “The emphasis in his work was always on the needto examine whole systems and to avoid the error of assuming that the whole wasmerely the sum of its parts” (1971,p.63).But if that is the general outlook – and there is no real contest about this among thecommentators on Henderson’s work – what were the proximate causes and imme-diate contexts of Henderson’s first full statements of the system of organism andenvironment? What were its visible and tacit sources? A connected sub-questionexamines how Henderson’s ideas compared with those of other contemporary biol-ogists who were similarly examining the ideas of life and matter: Walter Bradford"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"6Everett MendelsohnCannon, a Harvard colleague and author ofThe Wisdom of the Body(1932) and ofavery full biographical memoir published by the National Academy of Sciences(Cannon,1945), and Jacques Loeb, a Rockefeller Institute protagonist whose clas-sic essay “The Mechanistic Concept of Life” (1912) stood in sharp contrast to theorganicism of the two Harvard scientists.The obvious first sources for Henderson’s fitness argument were the studieshe began in 1905 on the equilibrium between acids and bases achieved in theorganism. These studies represented some of his most sustained scientific work.The buffer systems he noted served to maintain neutrality in physiological fluids.What he saw in this was “a remarkable and unsuspected degree of efficiency [and]a high factor of safety” (Parascandola,1968,p.70). In his 1908 paper “The theoryof neutrality regulation in the animal organism,” Henderson noted that, in part,this efficiency depended on the properties of some of the substances involved inphysiological reactions: that is, the dissociation constants of carbonic acid andmonosodium phosphate and the gaseous nature of carbon dioxide, which allowseasy excretion. This buffer action is a key to the stability of all living organisms – but,even more, it served to stabilize hydrogen ion concentrations in oceans and otherwaters. Henderson realized that water, with its extraordinary properties, togetherwith carbon dioxide seemed uniquely fit to serve as the basis for all living systems(Edsall,1973,p.350).Reflecting on this early work in “Memories,” Henderson cited this as the pointat which he became interested in the “fitness” of those substances for physiologicalprocesses (1936–9,p.134). According to Cannon (1945), the discovery of the“extraordinary capacity” of carbonic acid to preserve neutrality had “far-reachinginfluences in Henderson’s thinking.” Henderson extended research into neutrality-maintenance capacity, which became a key element in his later work on physico-chemical systems (Cannon,1945,p.35).In his report on Henderson’s early work, younger colleague John Edsall notedthat these “basic facts pointed clearly to a ‘teleological order’ in the universe.” ButEdsall immediately went on to indicate that Henderson “explicitly disavowed anyattempt to associate this order with notions of design or purpose in nature, andconsidered his views fully compatible with a mechanistic outlook on the problemsof biology” (Edsall, 1973, p. 350).Henderson also credited John Theodore Merz’History of European Thought inthe Nineteenth Centuryfor its influence on the philosophical sections of theFitnessvolume. Merz’ four-volume study, with a whole volume devoted to the sciences, isfundamentally organismic in its outlook, and Merz was quite adept at identifyingscientific and philosophical interactions (Henderson,1936–9,p.173).Retrospectively, Henderson also identified a “eureka moment” that occurred onor about Washington’s Birthday, 1912, while he was walking down the slopes of"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"1 Locating “fitness” and L. J. Henderson7Monadnock (a southern New Hampshire mountain) and thinking about the historyof science course he was teaching. He recounted: “...itoccurred to me sud-denly, unexpectedly, and without any preliminary symptoms that I was aware ofwhat I had been looking for in thinking about the fitness of the environment; [itremained] vivid and unforgettable” (1936–9,p.175). It seemed to come togetherfor him when he saw phosphate systems as very efficient buffers; he pondered the“usefulness of substances” and wondered whether “usefulness was an accident”(p. 177).But to make sure that he would not be misunderstood, Henderson hurriedlyassured his readers (and himself?) “that at this stage, I knew nothing of the litera-ture of natural theology.” Although he vaguely recollected William Paley and thewatchmaker, he confessed that there was nothing in the history of thought “of whichIwas more ignorant and to which I was more indifferent.” Having grown up in aperiod dominated by Darwin, he had known nothing of theBridgewater Treatises(in which natural theology was explored at length by nineteenth-century scientists),and he had not been worried by the introduction of final causes into science. Hewasaware of, but not thoroughly knowledgeable about, the teleological literatureand arguments (pp. 170–9).By February 1912, however, having become fully convinced of the primacyof carbonic acid and water in the environment and the importance of the bufferconcept, he set about writingThe Fitness of the Environment.Heclaimed that hemade no outline of the book (or of later ones, for that matter, including the treatiseonBlood) and spent less than sixty days (and probably closer to fifty) writing thevolume (p. 186).In structuring his argument inFitness, Henderson pointed to the Darwinianview of fitness as involving a mutual relationship between the organism and theenvironment and stressed the essential role of the environment as being of equalimportance to the evolution of the organism. He opened his argument with thefollowing paragraph:Darwinian fitness is compounded of a mutual relationship between the organism and theenvironment. Of this, fitness of [the] environment is quite as essential a component as thefitness which arises in the process of organic evolution; and in fundamental characteristicsthe actual environment is the fittest possible abode of life. Such is the thesis which thepresent volume seeks to establish. This is not a novel hypothesis. In rudimentary form ithas already a long history behind it, and it was a familiar doctrine in the early nineteenthcentury. It presents itself anew as a result of the recent growth of the science of physicalchemistry.(p. v)His strong claim was that the actual environment is the fittest one possible for livingorganisms. Let me now locate Henderson’s claims."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"8Everett MendelsohnLocating Henderson’s claimsEven as a sophomore at Harvard, Henderson confided in his “Memories” that hehad “a vague feeling that there are not only many undiscovered simple uniformitiesbehind the complexities of things, but also undiscovered unifying principles andexplanations” (1936–9,p.16). But there was more. Alongside this explanation, herecounted that he came upon William Prout’s hypothesis (1815–16) concerning theperiodic classification of chemical elements (all are multiples of the atomic mass ofhydrogen) and felt the order involved must have an explanation. Was he retrospec-tively claiming thathe had himself become “fit”to search for an understanding ofthe “fitness principle”? He was certainly willing to stray beyond the boundaries ofthe laboratory and the conceptual borders of the sciences.By 1908, just as he was embarking on the construction of the fitness theory,Henderson began attending the philosophy and logic seminars of Josiah Roycein Harvard’s Department of Philosophy. Through this channel, he came to knowthe works of Alfred North Whitehead, Bertrand Russell, and other contemporaryphilosophers. He continued to sit in on philosophy seminars in subsequent years.In the preface toFitness,hegenerously acknowledged Royce: “His learning andgenerosity have in the past aided me to reach an understanding of the philosophicalproblems of science, and in the preparation of this book have repeatedly guided mearight” (p. xi). Royce himself had expressed belief in a form of universal teleology inhis 1901 bookThe World and the Individual, and he enthusiastically called Hender-son’s work to the attention of other philosophers. In a long footnote at the conclusionofFitness, Henderson cited Royce’s teleological vision from the 1896 volumeTheSpirit of Modern Philosophy(Henderson,1913,p.311). The two joined with otherHarvard faculty to discuss issues in the history and philosophy of science. Thesemeetings went on for a full decade (1936–9, pp. 209–12; Parascandola,1968,p.71).In his work, Henderson’s ideas of fitness developed along with a growing interestin regulation of the physiological processes of the organism. Although he only laterreferred to this work, it was very much in accord with the concept of maintainingthemilieu int ́erieurdeveloped in the later decades of the nineteenth century byClaude Bernard and other contemporaries. (Henderson wrote a preface to an Englishtranslation ofExperimental Medicine[Henderson,1927] and made significant useof Bernard in setting out the problem he explored inBlood: A Study of GeneralPhysiology[1928]). But in his paper on the excretion of acids (1911), Hendersonzeroed in on the seeming fitness of certain substances for physiological processes,pointing to the excretion of phosphoric acid as an indicator of renal action needed tomaintain an acid–base balance: “There seems to be nothing in evolutionary theoryto explain it and for the present it must be considered a happy chance . . .” (1911,p. 21; Parascandola,1968,p.73)."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"1 Locating “fitness” and L. J. Henderson9In “Memories,” Henderson looked back and noted that he had questioned whetherthe role of carbon dioxide and phosphates was somehow linked in retrospect tospecial properties that made them more appropriate for physiological processes.As noted earlier, he located the moment at which the idea of the reciprocal natureof biological fitness came to him on Washington’s Birthday, 1912:Isawthat fitness must be a reciprocal relation, that adaptations in the Darwinian sensemust be adaptations to something, and that complexity, stability, and intensity and diversityof metabolism in organisms could not have resulted through adaptation unless there weresome sort of pattern in the properties of the environment that, as I now partly knew, is bothintricate and singular.(1936–9, pp. 177–80)His research focus became water, carbon dioxide, and other carbon compounds(see the bibliography in Cannon,1945, pp. 52–3. At the level of theory, he lookedfor a single order that linked biological and cosmic evolution. (He addressed thislatter theme at length in his second fitness book,The Order of Nature, 1917.) Wasthe explanation he sought mechanical or teleological? But teleology, as he used theterm, was limited. There wereno final causes, no entelechy(emphasis added). The“teleological principle” in his understanding was inherent in matter and energy.These natural phenomena have original principles “essentially not by chance.” ButHenderson was consciously agnostic and refused to seek or find religious links forteleology. (His aversion to religious thought went back to his boyhood and wasdescribed vividly in “Memories” [1936–9, pp. 31–3].) For Henderson, teleologystood in parallel to mechanism, not as a replacement for it. As he put it in the prefacetoThe Order of Nature: “Beneath all the organic structures and functions are themolecules and their activities...[they] . . . have been moulded by the process ofevolution...andhavealso formed the environment” (1917,p.iv).Henderson was struggling not to be misunderstood, and he concluded his prefacewith a plea:2Ibegthe reader to bear this in mind and constantly to remember one simple question: Whatare the physical and chemical origins of diversity among inorganic and organic things, andhow shall the adaptability of matter and energy be described? He may then see his waythrough all the difficulties which philosophical and biological thought have accumulatedaround a problem that in the final analysis belongs only to physical science, and at the endhe will find a provisional answer to the question.But misunderstood he was. At least he thought he was. His correspondence wasfilled with letters attempting to clarify and define teleology. I include a long excerptfrom a letter to Paul Lawson (Henderson,1918b)sothat the reader can betterunderstand what Henderson was attempting to achieve:2He returned directly to this issue in his review of J. S. Haldane’sMechanism, Life and Personality, 1913,discussed later in this chapter."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"10Everett MendelsohnIt is a little difficult for me to reply to your remarks concerning my two books and the ideaof teleology. My own opinion is that what I have said is considerably less philosophicalthan your interpretation of it. If you will look at a living organism, or at a watch, you willfind that it possesses, like many other things in the world, a pattern. There is a certainpeculiarity, however, about the pattern of the watch which resembles the peculiarity of thepattern of the living organism, and differs from the peculiarity of the pattern of certain otherthings possessing other well-marked patterns, such as, for instance, the orbit of a planet, ora geometrical figure. This seems to me to be an objective characteristic of the watch whichwe know to have been an excellent proof of the fact that the watch was designed. It seems tome also to be an objective characteristic of the organism, and, in the case of the organism,the current interpretation of explanations of it is that it is natural selection.What I maintain is that there is a pattern in the ultimate properties of the chemical elementsand in the ultimate physico-chemical properties of all phenomena considered in relation toeach other. I do not mean to say that this pattern is exactly of the same nature as the patternof the watch or an organism. Still less do I mean to say or to imply anything about design ormind. The only minds that I know are the minds of the individual organisms that I encounterupon the earth. But I feel perfectly justified, in spite of a certain unavoidable vagueness andambiguity, in using the word “teleology” for the pattern in which I am interested.The important thing to my mind is, nevertheless, not any doubtful talking about the propername to discuss such a thing, but the fact itself. That is to say, the objective fact thatthe properties of the elements bear a certain very curious relationship to the process ofevolution.InThe Order of Nature, Henderson’s philosophical explorations came farther for-ward as he recounted the ideas of natural organization and teleology in a wide arrayof earlier authors from Aristotle through Descartes, Leibniz, Kant, Goethe, Bernard,Dreisch, J. S. Haldane, and Bosanquet. But the problem of reconciling mechanismin nature with indications of purpose was the way Cannon had set out the prob-lem in his biographical memoir: There was indeed “a teleological appearance oftheworld...Itissomething that is real...”Thesolar system, meteorologicalcycle, and organic cycle seem to imply “a harmony which corresponds to an orderin nature.” As for Henderson’s question “What is the mechanistic origin of thepresent order of nature?” the answer, Cannon suggested, “may be approximatelysolved by discovering, step by step, how the general laws of physical science worktogether upon the properties of matter and energy so as to produce that order” (1945,p. 38).Henderson had already indicated in the closing pages ofFitnesswhat he thoughthe had achieved and what limits he had set on teleology:At length we have reached the conclusion which I was concerned to establish. Science hasfinally put the old teleology to death. Its disembodied spirit, freed from vitalism and allmaterial ties, immortal, alone lives on, and from such a ghost science has nothing to fear.The man of science is not even obliged to have an opinion concerning its reality, for it dwellsin another world where he as a scientist can never enter.(1913, p. 311)"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"1 Locating “fitness” and L. J. Henderson11But Henderson had struggled to reach this point in his argument. As he summedup his thinking, he again asked the question “What then becomes of fitness?” He hadalready banished all metaphysical teleology from science and was left to explore twopossibilities: “An unknown mechanistic explanation” of both cosmic and organicevolution exists – or it does not. While Henderson found it hard to credit such an“unknown” explanation, he added, with the historian’s eye, that before Darwin’senunciation of natural selection it was hard to imagine a mechanical explanationof biological fitness. Therefore, at the end ofFitnesshe warned: “We shall do wellnot to decide against such a possibility” (1913, pp. 305–6). But let me be clear.When Henderson was composingFitness,hehad rejected the then current theoriesof vitalism and that of a designer for nature; but he had insisted on maintaining theterm “teleology,” albeit adjusted as he saw “fit.” Was there ambiguity in his text?Let us turn to Henderson’s contemporaries for a response.What did Henderson’s contemporaries say about his work?Henderson’s two early books,Fitness(1913) andThe Order of Nature(1917),were reviewed by contemporary scientists and philosophers. Their reception, notdramatic by any standard, gives a good indication of the role of his ideas. It isinteresting to note that Henderson’s “reflective” and philosophically structuredpresentations antedated his fuller theoretical-scientific volume onBlood: A Studyin General Physiology(1928), which itself developed from a sequence of papers intheJournal of Biological Chemistry, entitled “Blood as a physico-chemical system,”beginning in 1921 and concluding in 1931.One of the earliest, but also the fullest, reviews ofFitnessappeared inScience(thejournal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science) in September1913 by the physiologist Ralph S. Lillie, who was at the time teaching at ClarkUniversity and later taught at the University of Chicago. His opening lines set outhis view: “This book is essentially a discussion of the nature and implications oforganic adaptation, that is, of the relation between the living organism and theenvironment, but is written from an unusual point of view.” Lillie took the timeand space to follow Henderson through his argument chapter by chapter with thefull identification of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen and their unique characteristics“which make possible the production of living protoplasm.” They demonstrate “thegreatest possible fitness for life” Lillie (1913), p. 337.But Lillie was not completely satisfied with the adaptive teleology that Hen-derson had developed. He noted the transfer of the conception of fitness from theorganic to the inorganic environment, which thereby achieves the reciprocal natureof biological adaptation. However, Lillie countered that Henderson had not dealtin detail with the organism itself and the interrelation between organisms and theenvironment:"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"12Everett Mendelsohn...inother words, what adaptation is, as a general condition or process . . . Of course, theuniverse is a fit environment for life because it continues to exist in it. Granted, systemshaving the properties of living beings could not have arisen had the properties of carbon,hydrogen, and oxygen, and of their combinations, been other than they are, but what doesthis prove?Most biologists, Lillie asserted, would see the central thesis Henderson advanced“as either self-evident or inherently unprovable.” He seemed to mock Hendersonin a footnote by saying, sure, this world is the best possible environment for theorganisms that came to live in it – almost a truism, he implies – but what of otherorganisms in a different cosmos? Biologists may well see the book as an essay onthe elements and compounds that form protoplasm, thus calling attention to oftenoverlooked “facts and principles” (p. 340).But Lillie was not satisfied with this reading; instead, he wanted to probe thequestions “of the final significance of biological adaptations and the novel and inter-esting manner in which they are raised.” He was amazed at Henderson’s surprisethat the environment and the organism possess similar characteristics. The surviv-ing organic forms are those that have been able to maintain equilibrium with theirenvironment. If conditions change and organisms can’t compensate, they will fail.That, after all, is what natural selection is all about. “The task of biological scienceis thus left where we found it: to account for the characteristics of organisms onthe basis of the physico-chemical characteristics of their component elements andcompounds . . .” and to demonstrate how these living characteristics are formedby the environment (p. 341). Does that mean that life was somehow potential orimplicit in matter, in the universe? “To the scientific investigator,” Lillie announced,“such a statement can have little meaning, since it is remote from the possibility ofverification” (p. 341).J. D. Bernal, the materialist, in his bookThe Origin of Life(1967) summed itup succinctly: all of Henderson’s evidence shows that “life had to make do withwhat it had, for if it failed to do so it would not have been there at all” (p. 169). Isthere a way out by postulating a universe biocentric from its inception? Lillie joinedHenderson in a cautious welcome to this view, in that the complexity, peculiarities,and stability of organisms would be unintelligible except for something of this sort.For the final question posed by his reading ofFitness, Lillie asked: “How thenis it possible to reconcile teleology and the existence of will and purpose in naturewith the existence of a physico-chemical determinism which appears the more rigidthe further scientific analysis proceeds?” This question, which he did not answerin the review, Lillie admitted (and which is often pushed to the side by scientists),would require biological knowledge for a solution – if one is ever achieved. Lillieconcluded that Henderson’s book points biologists to the “importance and urgencyof these questions (p. 342).” A polite, friendly, but hardly full endorsement."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"1 Locating “fitness” and L. J. Henderson13Writing inThe Dial, A Fortnightly Journal of Literary Criticism, Discussionand Information, Raymond Pearl, the population biologist, opened his 1913 reviewwith reference to a metaphysical diversion “of my academic and intellectuallyirresponsible youth,” in which orthodox Darwinism was turned on its head. “Is therenot quite as much justification, so far as the objective facts of nature are concerned,for one to say that the environment is adapted to the organism as there is for himto make the converse propositions?” (Pearl1913,p.111). Could natural selection,“or any other mechanistic hypothesis,” stand up to the task? It would utterly fail,Pearl argued. Before Henderson’sFitness,nosystematic efforts had been made toexamine the fitness of the elements of the environment for sustaining life.Henderson’s own examination, Pearl opined, was in many ways a remarkableone. He showed “conclusively” that the known environment of the earth is betteradapted to the needs of organisms than any other that could be constructed. Hepraised the collection and critical digestion of a great mass of data, describing it asa “masterly contribution to scientific synthesis that establishes the now well-knownconclusions.” But having recited those findings, Pearl announced: “At this point thebook as a contribution to naturalScience[in original] comes to an end.” Turningto the final chapter, “Life and the Cosmos,” which Pearl called “a considerationof the philosophical consequences” of the earlier scientific material, he was muchless kind. While this part of the book was well done, “[I]t seems to this reviewer,at least, to fall short in compelling logical force of the purely scientific part ofthe work” (p. 112). Henderson showed, Pearl noted, that “existing science” wasunable to give any “satisfactory mechanical explanation” to the reciprocal fitnessof organism and environment while not ruling out its possibility. Pearl was clearlynot enthralled by Henderson’s proposal of a “devitalized teleology in the form ofa purposive ‘tendency’ working steadily through the whole process of evolution.”The objection was direct: “This ‘tendency’ is not something which can be weighedor measured” but is rather an original property of matter “assumedly not by chance,which organized the universe in space and time.” In other words, it falls beyondthe bounds of science. But Pearl’s overall commentary onFitnesswas adulatory.Notwithstanding his assessment of the concluding philosophical chapter, he con-ferred on the book the highest of honors, calling it a “logical sequel to theOriginof Species” (p. 112).An array of additional reviews appeared both in scientific journals, such asNature, and in philosophical ones, such asMind, with theHibbert Journalgenerallypraising the scientific data brought forward but scattering various interpretations ofthe philosophical conclusion throughout. The mechanism, vitalism, and teleologydebates current in the opening decades of the twentieth century had already beenrehearsed in the responses to Henderson’s own attempts to reconcile the mechanicaland the vital in a single system."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"14Everett MendelsohnOne interaction in the review literature, however, adds an additional element toHenderson’s ideas among other philosophically oriented biologists: the exchangebetween Henderson and J. S. Haldane, the physiological vitalist. Haldane’s ownentry into the discussion came in his earliest book on the debate,Mechanism,Life and Personality: An Examination of the Mechanistic Theory of Life and Mind,published in 1913, the same year as Henderson’s own contribution to the philosoph-ical discourse. InScience,September 17, 1915, Henderson produced an extensivereview, opening in what almost might be considered an “airy” fashion: “Dr. J. S.Haldane has long been known as a philosophic physiologist. Indeed it is now formore than three decades that he has occasionally relieved the labors of an orthodoxand eminent scientific investigator with the pleasures of idealistic metaphysics”(Henderson 1915, p. 378). Henderson recounted at length Haldane’s understandingof the claims of mechanism and the failings inherent in them, as well as the fun-damental claim that Haldane finally reached: “The phenomena of life are of such anature that no physical or chemical explanation of them is remotely conceivable”(p. 379). If the concept of “organism” had been the first major stumbling block formechanism in Haldane’s view, psychology, or mind, raised the bar for mechanismeven higher.Henderson would have none – or very little – of it: “It is no light task for a manof science to form a critical judgment of this book, for I believe that its weaknessis on the philosophical side” (p. 381). Henderson had, of course, recently been putthrough some criticisms of his own philosophical endeavors. While he was quitewilling to quickly accept the critique of childish or crude mechanistic explanations,he by no means gave way to Haldane’s broad rejection: “When we turn to Haldane’sphilosophical objections to the mechanistic standpoint we encounter, I believe,grave inconsistencies in his argument” (p. 381). Henderson was unwilling to acceptHaldane’s claim of the prior impossibility of providing a mechanistic explanation.He referred to T. H. Morgan’s work in developing a mechanistic theory of heredity,called “inconceivable” by Haldane. Henderson also referred to Darwin’s feat ofmaking a mechanistic explanation of evolution conceivable.The structure of Henderson’s arguments was cast very much in the mode ofClaude Bernard’s earlier use of levels of explanation and referred to Cannon’s workon fear and rage, which adopted this Bernardian outlook. Henderson vigorouslyrejected Haldane’s claim that “all attempts to trace the ultimate mechanism oflife must be given up as meaningless.” Instead, he countered with his own stand:“And for my own part I am obliged to say regarding [Haldane’s] statement, ‘Thephenomena of life are of such a nature that no physical or chemical explanationof them is remotely conceivable,’ that is true only in a sense quite different fromits apparent meaning and is of noscientificinterest.” In having to confront theantimechanism of Haldane, Henderson further identified his own location as heattempted to reconcile the worlds of life and matter."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"1 Locating “fitness” and L. J. Henderson15In 1917, Haldane undertook a review inNatureof Henderson’s second book,The Order of Nature(1917), which he saw as a follow-up toFitness.Henotedthat with the wide adoption of natural selection the nineteenth-century conceptionof teleology had largely dropped from scientific discourse. He further noted thatHenderson accepted natural selection, yet wanted to maintain a version of teleologybased on the physical properties of matter in the universe and the organisms existingin a functional relationship – the teleological arrangement: “[Henderson] avoids alltheological inference, and leaves us with teleological arrangement as an ultimateand mysterious empirical fact” (Haldane1917,p.263).But Haldane was not satisfied. Must we assume, he asked, that the universe iscomposed at the outset of matter – eternal, unchangeable, and independent? He wasunhappy with the concept of system that Henderson proffered: “Biology deals, notmerely with the ‘efficient’ causes of ordinary physics and chemistry, but also withwhat Aristotle called ‘final’ causes.” It is in the biological facts that “teleology isrevealed as immanent in nature – as of its essence and no mere accident” appearing inthe physical environment – and not only in organisms. Biological concepts, Haldanebelieved, must be extended to the inorganic world. While knowledge of how thiswould work is not now present, it requires only a further extension of knowledge.Haldane’s hope for the future was that physics and chemistry would be penetrated byconceptions akin to those of biology. If this occurs, “teleological reasoning will takea natural place in the physical sciences” (p. 263). As I understand it, this is not whereHenderson was going; and in a later criticism of Henderson’s bookBlood: A Studyin General Physiology(1928), Haldane stressed how his and Henderson’s divergentviews and also the extent to which Henderson’s commitment to the understandingthat living things (for example, protoplasm) are physico-chemical systems furtherseparated them (Haldane,1929).In the years following publication ofFitness of the EnvironmentandThe Order ofNature, Henderson reported in “Memories” that he stepped back even farther fromteleological guides. He also stated that after his work on the sociologist Pareto, hebecame significantly more skeptical of metaphysics – to the extent that he regret-ted some of his earlier writings, seeing the discussion of “teleology, vitalism, andso forth, more or less irrelevant and immature.” He noted that he had been lessskeptical than he should have been and claimed that much of what he wrote inattempting to explain fitness in metaphysical and teleological terms was meaning-less (Parascandola,1968,p.107; Henderson,1936–9: pp. 173ff.). But he did notreject fitness as a concept and continued to see it as a valuable, and perhaps eventhe most interesting, part of his scientific work.As he moved to the close ofBlood(1928), Henderson restated the claims he orig-inally made inThe Order of Nature(1917) for the critical role of carbon, hydrogen,and oxygen, which “make up a unique ensemble of properties . . . [which are]of the highest importance in the evolutionary process,” making diversity possible."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"16Everett MendelsohnThese elements, he emphasized, provide the “fittest ensemble of characteristics fordurable mechanism.” In 1928, he still claimed: “For these facts I have no explana-tion to offer. All that I can say is that they exist, that they are antecedent to organicadaptations, that they resemble them, and that they can hardly be due to chance”(1928, pp. 355–6;1917, pp. 184–5).DidFitnesschallenge and provoke his contemporaries to take up the conceptand use it as a guide to further scientific work? Reviews do not suggest this. Bycomparison, his later work onBloodas a physiological system much more clearlyevoked the laboratory labors of his contemporaries. Its detailed analysis of what hereferred to as “an immensely complex system in equilibrium” served as a vigorousstimulant to further experiment and explanation.Fitnessremains to this day a sym-bol of attempts to provide broader explanation of the complexity of the worlds of theliving and the non-living. When George Wald, the Harvard biochemist, was askedto write the introduction to the 1970 reprint ofFitness,hetried to set Henderson’sbook in time: pre-World War I, a time when the atom was gaining its redefinitionat the hands of Rutherford, Rydberg, Mosley, and Bohr. This was before importantnew forms of chemical bonding had been established, and biochemistry was stillin its infancy. What Wald did not suggest was that Henderson’s book stimulatednew scientific endeavors. Instead, he alluded to the significant advances that hadbeen made in the sciences, often obviating some of Henderson’s questions. Hepointed to one conjecture: “A possible abode of life not unlike the earth appar-ently must be a frequent occurrence in space” and that perhaps even “‘thousands’of such planets” exist. He further noted the current expectation of there being“many thousand million millions” of such possible abodes for life.” This conjec-ture should arise, in Wald’s view, wherever it can (1970,p.xxii). It is in this sensethat Henderson’s “fitness” takes on an expansive meaning. It has fueled renewedinterest in the origin of life and the obvious extension: the synthesis of life in thelaboratory.Concluding remarksAs other chapters in this volume indicate, “Fitness” and “Order” have taken onother meanings, perhaps meanings that are more expansive than Henderson himselfintended. But it has always been clear that a book once published no longer belongsto the author, and its interpretation is no longer controlled by him. As indicated inthe pages above, Henderson tried in his response to reviewers to limit what he sawas some of the metaphysical turns given to their readings. In some ways, these viewswere unavoidable given Henderson’s own often imprecise ideas and his choice touse a term like “teleology” and attempt to give it his own meaning."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"1Locating “fitness” and L. J. Henderson17From early on in the years afterFitness,Henderson kept making clear his lackof sympathy with ideas of vitalism; and although he resisted announcing himselfacommitted mechanist, he clearly indicated his receptiveness to its explanatoryoutlook. In his paper “Mechanism, from the standpoint of physical science” (1918a)he once again revisited the debate begun as early as 1915 in his review of J. S.Haldane’sMechanism, Life and Personality(see above) and rejected the vitalismproposed by Hans Driesch and Haldane: “...for my part, I can only come backto the conviction that Driesch is talking too confidently about things that none ofus understand, and that . . . the weight of the evidence is greatly against him”(1918a, p. 574). As for “. . . Haldane’s conviction that it is impossible to conceiveorganization in physical and chemical terms, this seems by no means impossibleto most physiologists....Iaccept the mechanistic hypothesis as, upon the whole,most consistent with the evidence” (1918a, pp. 575–6).Even when Henderson turned to the organismic views of Alfred North Whiteheadhe was cautious. Henderson liked Whitehead, was influential in bringing him toHarvard, and together with Harvard’s President A. Lawrence Lowell involved himas one of the three founders of Harvard’s Society of Fellows. Yet in his reviewof Whitehead’sScience and the Modern World,the Lowell Lectures for 1925,while clearly appreciative of the development of the concept of organization, the“. . . doctrine Whitehead calls the theory of organic mechanism,” Henderson isnot fully enthusiastic. He notes a “lack of unity in the exposition,” with the author“still engaged in working out his theories.” Although he can “dimly . . . perceive”the possibility of overcoming the difficulties “. . . that have produced the conflictsbetween mechanism and vitalism, and between freedom and determinism . . . hopehas been so long deferred...itisnatural to be a skeptic” (1926, pp. 292–3).By the end of his life, Henderson had turned his interest from biological sys-tems to social systems. Complexity, interpretation, and organization were still verypresent, but the early challenges of “fitness” seemed largely absent.BibliographyBernal, J. D.

Henderson pointed out thatthe organisms would not exist at all except for the fitness of the environment itself.“Fitness there must be, in environment as well as in organism,” he declared near theoutset of his classic work,The Fitness of the Environment(1913, p. 6). While mostof Henderson’s contemporaries ignored the philosophical implications of this work,as John Barrow and Frank Tipler have noted, it “still comprises the foundation ofthe Anthropic Principle as applied to biochemical systems” (1986, p. 143).Henderson pointed out the uniqueness of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen in thechemistry of living organisms. Another two decades would pass before astronomerswould establish that these were three of the four most abundant elements in thecosmos; but Henderson was at least aware that these atoms were commonly foundin the stars and planets. In his treatise, he began with the properties of water, justas William Whewell had done eight decades earlier in his far more teleologicallyorientedBridgewater Treatise(1833).Henderson grouped the notable qualities of water under two headings: (1) thermalproperties and (2) interaction with other substances. As far as he was concerned,these were empirical, observed properties with minimal theoretical explanation.(Remember that Rutherford’s nuclear atom was still a future concept, while quantummechanics and the nature of the hydrogen bond lay many more years ahead.)Let me list water’s notable properties in a somewhat different order and presentavariety of specific examples. Water comes closer to being a universal solventthan any other known substance, a basic property familiar to anyone putting sugarinto a cup of coffee. In the human body, the digestive process takes place afternourishment has been dissolved into a liquid – water – solution. Even rocks can besubject to water’s dissolving powers: witness the ocean’s salinity. The solubility ofFitness of the Cosmos for Life: Biochemistry and Fine-Tuning,ed. J. D. Barrowet al.Published by Cambridge University Press.C\u0001Cambridge University Press 2007.20"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"2RevisitingThe Fitness of the Environment21carbon dioxide in water is particularly remarkable and so important in its conse-quences that Henderson devoted an entire chapter specifically to carbonic acid(formed when CO2joins with H2Otoform H2CO3), a topic akin to his ownresearch interests.The significance of this particular solubility is spectacularly demonstrated bycomparing the earth with its sister planet, Venus. The atmospheric pressure at thesurface of Venus is nearly a hundred times greater than at the surface of the earth,and the Cytherean atmosphere itself is more than 96 percent carbon dioxide. Theearth’s atmosphere would be similar if the oceans had not dissolved the carbondioxide and precipitated the excess in the form of limestone. One can scarcelybegin to imagine the tons of Indiana limestone resting on our shoulders if the earth,like Venus, had no oceans.Carbon dioxide is highly soluble not only in water, but also in air, capable ofdissolving essentially to the same extent in equal volumes of either substance. Thisclosely balanced solubility is vividly demonstrated to anyone opening a carbonatedbeverage after vigorously shaking the can. In human metabolism, a complex seriesof enzymes enables carbohydrates to be “burned” to produce the energy for life. Inthis process, the oxygen combines with the carbon and hydrogen to form carbondioxide and water, waste products that must be eliminated. Fortunately, carbondioxide can be dissolved in the blood, and equally fortunately it can be releasedinto the air by the lungs, a process Henderson described clearly:In the course of a day a man of average size produces, as a result of his active metabolism,nearly two pounds of carbon dioxide. All this must be rapidly removed from the body. Itis difficult to imagine by what elaborate chemical and physical devices the body could riditself of such enormous quantities of material were it not for the fact that, in the blood, theacid can circulate partly free . . . and in the lungs [carbon dioxide] can escape into the airwhich is charged with but little of the gas. Were carbon dioxide not gaseous, its excretionwould be the greatest of physiological tasks; were it not freely soluble, a host of the mostuniversal existing physiological processes would be impossible.(1913, pp. 139–40)Michael Denton, who quoted this passage inNature’s Destiny,went on to say:As every medical student learns, it can be shown, from estimates of the total amount ofcarbon dioxide dissolved in the blood and from estimates of the difference in the amountof dissolved carbon dioxide in arterial and venous blood, that most of the 200 milliliters ofcarbon dioxide produced per minute in an average adult human cannot be transported insimple physical solution to the lungs.(1998, p. 132)In fact, the carbonic acid formed when carbon dioxide dissolves in the water grad-ually ionizes to form an acidic H+ion and a bicarbonate base, HCO−3:CO2+H2O→H2CO3→H++HCO−3"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"22Owen GingerichIn the lungs, the process is reversed, releasing the carbon dioxide. If an excess ofH+ions accrues through metabolism, this excess also drives the process toward H2Oand CO2, and the acidity is removed essentially by exhaling the carbon dioxide.Thus, this process not only eliminates the waste product of metabolism, but alsopreserves the neutrality of the blood. Henderson lauded the accuracy of this system,and Denton remarked that “It is a solution of breathtaking elegance and parsimony”(1998,p.133). The same buffering that plays such a remarkable role for large air-breathing organisms also preserves the neutrality of the oceans.Henderson pointed out another property of water: its high surface tension, whichis substantially higher than that of any other common liquid except mercury. Thiscurious property allows water striders to walk across the surface of ponds or, as aparlor trick, partyers to float a double-edged razor blade in a bowl of water. Moreimportant, this property helps water to flow upward, against the force of gravity, inthe tiny veins of even tall plants.Because of the very high specific heat of water, a comparatively large amountof heat energy is required to raise its temperature. This property accounts for thegeneral constancy of ocean temperatures and keeps the earth’s oceans in a liquidstate. Coupled with this high specific heat is the remarkably high latent heat ofvaporization – the amount of energy required to turn water into steam – “by far thehighest known,” as Henderson described it. More than five times more energy isrequired to vaporize a given quantity of water than to raise the temperature of thewater from its freezing point to its boiling point.At the other side of the temperature scale, water has a most peculiar property: itexpands as it freezes, contrary to most known substances. Anyone who has sufferedthe misfortune of frozen water pipes in the winter will be all too familiar with thisproperty. Were it not for this anomalous expansion, ice would sink when it freezesand form a frozen reservoir at the bottom of the oceans. Because of the low thermalconductivity of water, the oceans would not thaw out in the summer. “Year after yearthe ice would increase in winter and persist through the summer, until eventuallyall or much of the body of water, according to the locality, would be turned to ice”(Henderson,1913,p.109). Henderson further stated that “[t]his unique propertyof water [the anomalous expansion on freezing] is the most familiar instance ofstriking natural fitness of the environment, although its importance has perhapsbeen overestimated”; but he added that “on the basis of its thermal propertiesalone . . . water is the one fit substance for its place in the process of universalevolution, when we regard that process biocentrically” (1913,p.107).The crucial role of carbon in the formation of life, so obvious to any organicchemist, comes later in Henderson’s treatment. He was obviously fascinated bythe environment, writ large – the oceans and the atmosphere – more than withthe circumstances of life itself. Perhaps this was because the latter topic was and"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"2RevisitingThe Fitness of the Environment23is shrouded in so much mystery, all the more so in 1913, compared with the present.Nevertheless, he extolled the virtues of the complexity afforded by carbon chem-istry. Fundamental to carbon’s versatility is its central location in the first long rowof the periodic table:34 5 6 78910LiBeBCNOFlNe11 7c.23007210Below the elements, I have listed the number of hydrides formed by each of them.(Because this table is taken from my chemistry notes of a half-century ago, thenumbers for carbon probably need updating. A Google search gives “thousands,”“vast,” and “near infinite” as the number of hydrocarbons.) Whatever the currentnumber – which of course does not count the numerous compounds of carbon withoxygen or nitrogen – it is clear that carbon greatly exceeds any atom, other thanhydrogen, in the number of different molecules it can make.In the years following the publication of Henderson’s book, insights into atomicstructure made the role of carbon much clearer and the unusual properties of watermore understandable, without in any way diminishing Henderson’s arguments orthe awe that accompanies appreciation of this fine-tuning of our environment.From the astrophysical perspective concerning carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen,the massive nucleus is the chief consideration. For chemistry, the much lighter sur-rounding swarm of electrons is the key to a deeper understanding of these fitnessproperties. With the discovery of the nuclear structure of the atom and the subse-quent development of quantum mechanics, a number of ways to envision atomicstructure developed. Here I shall adopt one of the chemist’s favorite models, usingatetrahedron to model the carbon atom. Two of carbon’s six electrons fill the innershell, and four are distributed at the corners of the tetrahedron. It is only theseouter electrons in the second shell that are modeled by the tetrahedron, but thisis the only part of the atom normally of interest to chemistry. (I disregard here,for example, the use of radioactive isotopes as tracers in determining chemicalstructures.)Eventually, to make sense of the data accumulating in the 1920s, physicistsproposed another degree of freedom (called “electron spin”) in arranging the elec-trons, suggesting that two electrons (with opposite spin) could occupy the sameposition. Thus, in the carbon tetrahedral representation, each vertex could accom-modate an additional electron, which could be an electron shared with a partner –for example, a hydrogen atom with its single electron – provided the electronswere paired with opposite spins. Such a sharing is known as a covalent bond. Fourhydrogen atoms, one at each corner, would give the carbon tetrahedron its fullcomplement of eight electrons, and, by sharing, each hydrogen atom would have"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"24Owen Gingerich(A)(C)(B)(D)Figure 2.1.

This stable configuration,shown in Figure2.1A,isthe molecule methane. Carbon, with its half-full quotaof electrons, is as willing to lend as to receive; therefore, one carbon can bondwith another, again provided that the shared electrons in each pair have oppo-site spins. The tetrahedral geometry allows a single, double, or triple covalentbond between two carbon atoms, as shown in Figure2.1B–D. When the remainingvertices are filled with hydrogen atoms, the resulting gases are ethane, ethylene,and acetylene. This self-bonding property of carbon is the key to its prodigiousfecundity.Oxygen can also be approximated with a tetrahedral structure. This example,because of the light it sheds on the structure of water, is actually more informativethan that of carbon. With six electrons for the outer shell, the oxygen atom willhave two full vertices (with two electrons each) and two partly filled vertices (witha single electron each). Oxygen, like carbon, can form covalent bonds with itself,with either a single or a double bond. With a double bond (Figure2.2C), no partlyfilled vertex remains, and the stable binary molecule that results is the normalform of oxygen gas found in the atmosphere. With a single bond, the two partlyfilled vertices can each join a hydrogen atom to form hydrogen peroxide (HO2H)(Figure2.2B)orjoin an additional oxygen atom to form a tight ring, ozone (O3)(Figure2.2D)."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"2RevisitingThe Fitness of the Environment25(A)(C)(D)(B)Figure 2.2.

The model shows thatthe hydrogen atoms will not lie on a straight line with the oxygen atom, a crucialfact if one is to understand the special properties of water. The tetrahedral angle isa reasonable approximation to the measured 104◦30\u0005angle in the water molecule.In what was undoubtedly the most significant chemical treatise of the twentiethcentury,The Nature of the Chemical Bond(1939), Linus Pauling highlighted anotherextraordinarily important type of chemical bond, the so-called hydrogen bond.Although the double-bonding property of hydrogen was hinted at as early as 1912,Pauling used the principles of quantum mechanics and atomic modeling to showthat hydrogen could participate in only a single covalent bond (that is, using sharedelectron pairs), so that a secondary bonding had to arise from something else,such as a weak electrostatic coupling. The “bent” model of the water molecule(Figure2.2A)gives a qualitative idea of how this might work. The electron sharedfrom each hydrogen atom is pulled toward the oxygen, leaving the flank of thepositive hydrogen nucleus somewhat exposed. Meanwhile, the positive nucleus of"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"26Owen GingerichFigure 2.3. The negative shoulder of the oxygen atom in the water moleculecouples briefly with the positive flank of a hydrogen atom in an adjoining moleculeto produce a transitory hydrogen bond, giving liquid water its remarkably stablephysical properties.the oxygen atom is more than balanced by the extra shared electrons, leaving thebroad shoulder of the water molecule with a residual negative charge. Therefore,an outlying positive hydrogen wing of one water molecule can be weakly andmomentarily coupled with the negative oxygen shoulder of another water molecule,as shown in Figure2.3. The duration of coupling is a second that is split very finelyindeed, typically around 10−11second.Nevertheless, this continual coupling and recoupling give water its remarkablethermal properties. Although liquid at average terrestrial temperatures and pres-sures, the water molecules are subtly linked by the hydrogen bonds, and so anunusual amount of energy is required to raise the temperature of water, or to vapor-ize it. Similarly, the electrostatic (or ionic) properties of the water molecule act tomake it a powerful solvent. Furthermore, as Pauling noticed, liquid water’s statis-tical structure is akin to that of ice, and not just a single form of close packing. Thetemperature change in the equilibrium of two types of packing causes the anoma-lous expansion of water as it falls below 4◦C; the lower density of ice itself resultsfrom the more open crystal structure of the solid water (Pauling,1939,p.284).Thus, we have been given a far deeper understanding of many of the extraordinaryproperties of water and its constituent atoms sinceThe Fitness of the Environmentwas written. Also, totally unknown to Henderson in1913were the complex chem-ical shapes and coding in the structures of life: the DNA and protein molecules.These architectures depend critically not only on the presence of the key atoms, butalso on the action of the hydrogen bond. The strands of the DNA double helix arejoined by hydrogen bonds, strong enough to hold the long chromosomes togetheryet weak enough to permit the strands to unzip when replication begins. Similarly,the crucial folding of the proteins, where shape plays a vital role in their efficacy,is guided by the sites of hydrogen bonding."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"2RevisitingThe Fitness of the Environment27Of course, these unique properties would have been of little avail had it notbeen for the substantial abundance of oxygen and carbon. But since hydrogen andoxygen rank numbers one and three, respectively, in cosmic abundance, water isguaranteed ubiquitous throughout the universe, while carbon is number four in thecosmic population. However, neither oxygen nor carbon emerged in the first threeminutes of the Big Bang. At first glance, this might be labeled “God’s Goof.” That’show the physicist George Gamow felt when he discovered the presumed flaw in thenature of the light elements that prevented the heavier elements from forming. Inthe first minute of the Big Bang, energetic photons transformed into protons, andthrough collisions these protons fused into deuterium (nuclear particles of mass2), tritium (nuclear particles of mass 3), and alpha particles (which would serve asmass 4 nuclei of helium atoms). But because there was no stable mass 5, at mass 4the fusion process stopped – well short of the 12 mass units needed for carbon orthe 16 for oxygen.Gamow, with his impish wit, wrote his own version of Genesis 1, in whichGod, in His excitement at creating the universe, failed to call for a stable mass 5.Disappointed by the error, God “wanted to contract the universe again and starteverything from the beginning. But, that would be much too simple. Instead, beingAlmighty, God decided to make heavy elements in the most impossible way”:And so God said: “Let there be Hoyle.” And there was [Fred] Hoyle. And God saw Hoyleand told him to make heavy elements in any way he pleased.And so Hoyle decided to make heavy elements in stars, and to spread them around by meansof supernova explosions. But in doing so, Hoyle had to follow the blueprint of abundanceswhich God prepared earlier when He had planned to make the elements from Ylem [theprimordial soup of high-energy photons].Thus, with the help of God, Hoyle made all heavy elements in stars, but it was so complicatedthat neither Hoyle, nor God, nor anybody else can now figure out exactly how it was done.(Gamow,1970,p.127)1Far from being a design flaw in our universe, however, the missing mass 5 seemsessential to our existence. Suppose that mass 5 were stable. Then, with the over-whelming abundance of protons in the opening minutes of the universe, atom build-ing could have taken place in mass steps of one, right up the nuclear ladder towardiron. This would have left no special abundance of carbon and oxygen, two essentialbuilding blocks of life. Because no stable mass 5 exists, element-building in thestars actually takes place in a two-step process. First, the hydrogen is converted intohelium. Then, in a second process, the abundant helium is built up into atoms whosenuclei consist of integer numbers of helium nuclei of mass 4. This includes oxygen1Gamow speculated that this parody might account for his not having received an invitation to the 1958 SolvayCongress on cosmology."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"28Owen Gingerichwith nuclear mass 16 and carbon with mass 12, which, as I have indicated, are themost abundant atoms in the cosmos after hydrogen and helium. Without the missingmass 5 (as well as several other puzzling details in the structures of these lighterelements), not only might we not have the life-giving abundance of carbon andoxygen, we would also lack the long, slow hydrogen “burning” of main-sequencestars. It is this tedious process of long-drawn-out hydrogen burning that providesthe stable solar environment in which the evolutionary sequences can work out.What at first glance, then, appeared to be God’s mistake turns out, in fact, to beone of God’s most ingenious triumphs. Certainly, the way our universe works – thatit takes a very long time to generate the heavier elements – depends critically onthe lack of a stable mass 5. In the absence of a nuclear ladder with easy unit stepsin mass, the ladder goes up in steps of four, so that the production of the variousintervening heavier elements, such as nitrogen, is a complicated matter.But another mystery presents itself: if the ladder goes up in steps of four, whereis beryllium at mass step 8? Beryllium is naturally abundant, but it is seven orders ofmagnitude rarer than oxygen or carbon; this reflects the instability of the process offusing two alpha particles (each of mass 4) into Be8.Asimultaneous triple collision –so that three alpha particles could fuse to produce carbon – is a highly improba-ble event. But in 1952, Edwin Salpeter pointed out an evolutionary process inmore massive stars that had exhausted their hydrogen fuel. As the interior temper-ature rose because of the gradual gravitational collapse of the cores of such stars,the kinetic energy of the atomic nuclei eventually became hellish enough to producealowequilibrium amount of Be8. Then, sufficient collisions between berylliumand alpha particles (an exothermic reaction) could produce carbon and therebyfuel the stars’ radiative output. Salpeter proposed the following reactions (1952,pp. 349–52):He4+He4+95 keV(kinetic energy input)→Be8He4+Be8→C12+7400 keV(kinetic energy output)As alluded to in Gamow’s parody, the late Fred Hoyle was a leading player infiguring out the subsequent processes. He noted that the stars seemed too youngto have produced the observed high abundance of carbon unless some physicalcircumstances speeded up an otherwise extremely slow process. He therefore pro-posed that the collision cross-section of the beryllium was especially large, whichis another way of saying that a resonance level for an appropriately excited levelof carbon must be present. Because life, dependent on the high carbon abundance,does exist, he was able to predict the existence of a special resonance level in thecarbon nucleus. Hoyle’s prediction was a dramatic use of the strong AnthropicPrinciple, which states that the universe must have those properties that allow lifeto develop within it at some stage in its history (Barrow and Tipler,1986,p.21). The"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"2RevisitingThe Fitness of the Environment29experimental work showing that the resonance really did exist eventually broughtthe 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics to Willy Fowler.The stability of C12makes it vulnerable to the reactionHe4+C12→O16+7100 keV(kinetic energy output)butinthis case the closest resonance level is a half percent too low for the reactionto proceed with comparable efficiency. Had the resonance level in the carbon been4percent lower, there would be essentially no carbon. Had that level in the oxygenbeen only a half percent higher, virtually all of the carbon would have been convertedto oxygen. Without that carbon abundance, none of us would be here now.Hoyle later wrote:Some supercalculating intellect must have designed the properties of the carbon atom,otherwise the chance of my finding such an atom through the blind forces of nature would beutterly minuscule . . . The numbers one calculates from the facts seem to me so overwhelmingas to put this conclusion almost beyond question.(1981, pp. 8–12, esp. p. 12)These curious details of nuclear structure are among the many aspects of ouruniverse – including the anomalous expansion of water and of ice – that make itremarkably fertile for the existence of intelligent life, so much so as to cry out forsome explanation. Certainly, one logical possibility, along the lines of Aristotle’sfinal causes, is that a supercalculating intellect has designed the universe to make itso. Such a conclusion can be coherent and satisfying in the framework of a generalphilosophical and religious view of the cosmos. With the rise of modern sciencein the seventeenth century, however, final causes tended to go out of fashion, andit may be argued that science’s great success hinged on finding efficient causes –the “How” rather than the “Why.” Newton’s famous line in the General Scholium(added to the second edition of hisPrincipia)concerning the ultimate nature ofgravity, “I feign no hypotheses,” is consonant with Henderson’s own rather austereconclusion to his book:Returning now to fitness, we may be sure that, whatever successes science shall in the futurecelebrate within the domain of teleology, the philosopher will never cease to perceive thewonder of a universe which moves onward from chaos to very perfect harmonies, and,quite apart from any possible mechanistic explanation of origin and fulfillment, to feelit a worthy subject of reflection...Icannot hope to have provided more than a veryimperfect illumination of certain aspects of teleology in this venture upon the foreign fieldof metaphysics, and I should wish to be understood as very doubtful of my success in statingwhat seem to me some of the philosophical conclusions to be drawn from the fitness of theenvironment.Iwish, however, to put forward one scientific conclusion as a positive and, I trust, fruitfuloutcome of the present investigation.

Surely habitableenvironments abound, and the apparent fitness of the physico-chemical universewould seem to make it congenial to the existence of life that is chemically similarto the life we find on earth.

HaughtMy contribution to this volume is that of a theologian interested in the relationshipbetween science and religion. I will be asking whether what we are calling “fitnessfor life” and “biochemical fine-tuning” are consistent with, and perhaps even sup-portive of, the ageless religious convictions that the universe is here for a reason andthat life is the intended consequence of divine love, wisdom, and creative power.Today, it is particularly striking to many scientists that cosmic constants, phys-ical laws, biochemical pathways, and terrestrial conditions are just right for theemergence andflourishingof life. It is not surprising, of course, that, as life exists,the cosmic and chemical conditions for ithad to have beenformatted for such anemergence. It would be remarkable, however, if the format could have been oth-erwise, and hence not right for life. During the universe’s history, it now seemsthat only a very restricted set of physical conditions operative at several majorjunctures of emergence could have opened the gateways to life (Hogan,2000). So,what principles lie behind the narrowing of the gateways that allowed only thoseconditions preparatory to life to flow through while excluding any cosmologicalprinciples, physical parameters, and chemical laws that would not have permittedsuch an outcome?In the long, unfolding story of nature’s development, any conceivable series ofphysical conditions or constants other than those that would lead to life have beentossed aside. In fact, only the set that permitted life was allowed through a tightlyconstrictive filtering process. Close calls characterize the story throughout. And inour Big Bang universe, the fine-tuning of the specific trajectory that would leadto life began during the first moment of cosmic process. At that opening instant,all other sets of mathematically and physically conceivable expansion rates, grav-itational constants, and densities of matter were put aside, and only a single set,one that would eventually sponsor life, was allowed entry into actuality.

Haughtthe chemistry that would lead to life had to leave behind conceivable combinationsthat would prohibit the emergence of cellular and physiological complexity. Only achemistry that would allow for a limited variety of three-dimensional protein fold-ing, for example, could make way for the specific routes toward complexificationthat introduced sentience and consciousness into the Big Bang universe (Dentonet al., 2002). But can any of this fine-tuning be adequately understood withoutappealing to the idea of divine cosmic purpose?Religion and theology cannot be indifferent to the question of whether the phys-ical universe is the embodiment of an overarching meaning and purpose. However,cosmic purpose is not the same as design or fine-tuning, nor is the accumulation ofscientific information about fine-tuning absolutely essential to a plausible theolog-ical affirmation of purpose in the universe. Theologically speaking, what purposemeans, at the very minimum, is “the actualizing of value” – that is, of what appearsself-evidently good – not necessarily the instantiation of design, even though design,order, or a pattern may be an aspect of the actualizing of value. Thus, a universe thatappears to be in the process of bringing about such value-laden actualities as life,consciousness, freedom, creativity, and beauty, along with beings endowed with acapacity for reasonableness, selfless love, and promise keeping, could be said tohave an overarching purpose, provided, of course, that these achievements havebeen intended.1However, design and fine-tuning are ideas that are too narrow to capture thewayinwhich careful theological reflection would conceive of divine intention orpurposiveness in nature. After Darwin, moreover, it seems especially unwise toendow what is taken to be the Ultimate Source of the world’s being exclusively, oreven primarily, with the appellation “Designer.” Similarly, the scientific catalogingof items suggestive of biochemical fine-tuning does not, by itself, offer much sup-port to a theological argument for cosmic purpose. In fact, I believe it could befatal for theology to focus only on design and fine-tuning. Such a concentration,after all, would only make the ancient and persistent theodicy question all the moreintractable. Why would an allegedly designing deity, one capable of ordering nat-ural processes in the beautiful arrangement of crystals, protein folds, and cellularmechanisms, refrain from arranging the larger world of life in such a way as toprevent disease, pain, and death? The notion that God is essentially an “IntelligentDesigner” or “Fine-Tuner” has even led to the demise of natural theologies builttoo snugly on observation of natural forms of order alone (Buckley,1987). TheGod of religious experience, moreover, is as much adisturberas adistributerofdesign.1A reasoned theological discussion of purpose would also have to pay attention to the religious intuition that theworld’s attainment of value is in some way everlastingly preserved; I developed this concept elsewhere (2003)."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"3Isfine-tuning remarkable?33The question of divine actionWhether research into biochemical fine-tuning could be theologically consequen-tial inevitably brings up the more fundamental question of how to situate scientificexplanations in relationship to theological understanding. In modern times, thesetwo kinds of knowledge have often been seen as conflicting with each other. How-ever, the best of our theologians have never taught that it is necessary to choosebetween natural and theological explanations. Theological explanations do not pre-tend to be an alternative to scientific accounts, just as good science does not appealto supernatural causes.Unfortunately, though, religious believers today still sometimes fear that as sci-entific explanations become more and more persuasive – for example, in accountingfor the origin, evolution, and fine-tuning of life – the more they threaten to under-mine a robust religious sense of the creative or purposive power of God. At the sametime, scientists are sometimes apprehensive that the more room theology makes forthe notion of divine action in accounting for natural phenomena, the less room willbe available for meaningful scientific research (see my discussion of Cziko’s1995bookWithout Miracles, below). For instance, the remarkable series of physicaloccurrences that have taken place in a chemistry attuned to life can be laid out asa fully natural process explicable in physical and chemical terms. So why do weneed to invoke the idea of supernatural causation or cosmic purpose as essentialanywhere in the unfolding chain of occurrences? Anyway, if a Creator had intendedthe universe to produce life, why did it take so long for the right chemistry to comealong and for life to make its spontaneous debut relatively late in natural history?Science can give good physical explanations of emergent phenomena, and theseaccounts will surely become more detailed in the future. Thus, we must ask whetherthe idea of a wise Divine Designer (or Fine-Tuner) would be of much help in ourattempts to understand the natural world.This question is especially appropriate now that the story of nature shows itselfto have been strewn not only with what seems to be, in the human scale of under-standing, a wasted amount of time, but also a convoluted kind of engineering,such as the complicated stellar creation of carbon (as described, for example, byBurbidgeet al., 1957). And this is not to mention the often ruthless Darwinianprocesses that have shaped the story of life on earth. If the purpose of the uni-verse is to produce life and mind, what do all the delay and Darwinian debristell us about divine design, fine-tuning, and cosmic purpose? I believe that anyresearch into biochemical fine-tuning – especially if the goal of such research isto shed light on the question of cosmic purpose – must not take place in abstrac-tion from the larger picture of cosmic process and biological evolution. After all,Darwinian accounts of the evolution of life have made the idea of divine design seem"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"34John F. Haughtincreasingly shaky, and one cannot simply ignore this fact when reflecting on thequestion of fine-tuning (a notion that suggests design), whether at the level ofcosmology or biochemistry.Today, especially because of the apparent success and intellectual appeal ofevolutionary explanations, the ideas of divine action in general and divine designin particular seem to have lost their former appeal in attempts to make ultimatesense of the natural world (see, for example, Dawkins,1986, 1995, 1996; Dennett,1995). Before Darwin, it was in the world of life and its adaptive complexity thatnatural theology ascertained the most dazzling displays of divine fine-tuning. TheBoyle Lectures and Bridgewater Treatises, for example, sought characteristically toconnect the intelligent activity of God to the complexities of life. But now that theidea of natural selection has become for many scientists the ultimate explanationof adaptive design in living beings (Mayr,1997, pp. 64–78), it is tempting to lookelsewhere for the primary evidence of divine action. For example, the physics of theearly universe or segments of biochemistry seem to be exposing degrees of designor fine-tuning so improbable as to be suggestive of divine causation (Davies,1992).Even as a theologian interested in promoting good relations between science andreligion, I confess to an uneasiness about this “regionalizing” of research into fine-tuning, especially if the ultimate objective of such a project is to see whether scienceis now opening up new areas, after (and perhaps in spite of) Darwin, for invoking theidea of divine action and purposiveness in nature. Concentrating separately on oneor two chapters of apparent fine-tuning in the otherwise more ragged unfolding ofnature may allow the natural theologian to momentarily ignore the disorder, waste,struggle, suffering, and death that accompany evolution’s extravagant creativity.But the tormenting religious questions posed by Darwinian biology will continueto resist all attempts by natural theology to bracket them out. Therefore, speakingtheologically, research into biochemical fine-tuning would strike me as artificial,evasive, and inconsequential as long as it gives any appearance of pushing aside thequestions about divine action and cosmic purpose raised specifically by Darwinianbiology. Such reserve seems especially appropriate because, these days, those mostinterested in finding evidence of intelligent design and fine-tuning in nature areoften vociferous opponents of evolutionary biology (see, for example, Dembski,1998, 1999;Wells,2000).At another extreme, however, it is also a matter of concern to me that muchscientific thought has now concluded that the Darwinian notion of natural selectioncan provide an ultimately satisfying explanation of nearly everything in the worldof life (Haught,2000, 2003). The apparent success of evolutionary explanations ofadaptive design has fostered suspicion that scientific enlightenment now rendersthe ideas of cosmic purpose and divine action altogether superfluous as far as afundamental understanding of life is concerned. As one among many available"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"3Isfine-tuning remarkable?35examples of this exclusivist naturalism, I would note Gary Cziko’s bookWithoutMiracles(1995). Cziko maintains that the idea of divine influence, or what hecalls “providence,” is in competition with, rather than complementary to, scientificexplanations. In a succession of chapters, he labors to show that it is Darwinianmechanisms rather than divine providence that explain any specific feature of life,such as sight, hearing, or intelligence. Hence, as far as Cziko is concerned, one isforced to choose either science or providential action, but not both.Cziko’s explanatory monism (in which only one explanatory slot is available forall) inevitably leads to the conclusion that theological appeals to divine influenceare a threat to scientific explanation. Conversely, as mentioned previously, somereligious believers – explanatory monists of another stripe – consider a success-ful scientific search for natural explanations of biochemical fine-tuning to be animplicit threat to the consequentiality of theological explanation. Both varieties ofmonocausal thinking, of course, raise the fascinating question of what it meansto say that “God acts” in nature, an issue that lies at the heart of almost everycontemporary controversy involving science and theology. I cannot give sufficientcoverage to this discussion here, but I hope at least to demonstrate, by focusing onthe topics of fitness for life and biochemical fine-tuning, that theological explana-tions can, at least in principle, co-exist quite comfortably and non-competitivelywith scientific explanations. I shall do so, however, only by also keeping in mindthe special concerns about divine action raised by Darwinism.Layered explanationTheology, of course, does not strive for exactly the same kind of explanation in itsownregions of inquiry as science does with respect to natural causes. Theologymust take the discoveries of science seriously, but it cannot emulate the objectifyingfocus of scientific explanation without sacrificing its own substance. God, in otherwords, cannot become an object of scientific clarification without ceasing to beGod. Theology, moreover, can be seen to have explanatory relevance only if it isfirst able to show that, in principle, a plurality of non-conflicting layers of expla-nation can exist for any particular set of natural phenomena. Thus, theology wouldhave the role of ultimate explanation in an extended hierarchy of explanations thatincludes, and does not in any way compete with, scientific accounts. As long asone allows for layered explanation, in other words, theological discourse can bedeeply explanatory of the universe without in any way interfering with the morelucid levels of scientific inquiry. Indeed, when it is taken as a deep explanation,theology even supports and promotes the more regional inquiries that physicists,chemists, or biologists undertake at their own proper planes of exploration. And inits refusal to compete with or intrude into scientific levels of explanation, theology"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"36John F. Haughtmay itself arrive at a more satisfactory understanding of the meaning and location ofdivine action or cosmic purpose than was possible before the emergence of modernscience.By “layered explanation,” I mean that most things allow for more than one levelof explanation. For example, if someone asks me to explain why a fire is burning inmy backyard, one response might be, “Because the carbon in the wood is chemicallycombining with oxygen to make carbon dioxide.” But another might be, “BecauseI applied a lit match to wood.” And yet another could be, “Because I want to roasthot dogs.” Different layers of explanation, in other words, can co-exist withoutcompeting with one another, and it would be a mistake to squeeze one kind ofexplanation into an explanatory groove that is appropriate to another. Explanatorypluralism, additionally, is more likely than monocausal accounting to put the humanmind in touch with the full reality of what is being explained.It would follow, then, that if a beneficent God, for some mysterious reason, freelyintended to create a life-bearing universe, we would not look for evidence of thisdivine intentionality at the level of biochemical fine-tuning or natural selection ofreproductively adaptive organisms. This would be like trying to find “I want hotdogs” in the smoke from the burning wood in my backyard. And yet, it is justsuch direct physical “evidence” that the scientific naturalist and other explanatorymonists typically look for in theological accounts of the universe. The scientific nat-uralist’s complaints about theology usually amount to disappointment that the latteris not very good at giving “scientific explanations.” One of the clearest examplesof this curious expectation is in E. O. Wilson’s bookConsilience,inwhich thenoted author expresses his annoyance that by remaining silent on evolution“the biblical authors had missed the most important revelation of all!” (1998,p.6).The underlying assumption here is that only one explanatory slot is available to all,and since it now belongs to science, no place remains for theology.My point, though, is that good theology espouses an explanatory pluralism, asdistinct from explanatory monism, and this means that a multiplicity of layers ofexplanation are available to quench the human desire to understand the world.Accordingly, reference to divine action or divine creativity would make sense onlyif one located it at levels of understanding other than where physical causes arebeing investigated. This decoupling of explanations is a function of the fact thatevery explanation is abstracted from the totality of causal factors that bring about anyparticular outcome. This does not mean that no connection at all exists between andamong accounts. But theological explanations would stand in relation to nature – tosuch occurrences as biochemical fine-tuning, for example – analogously to the wayin which “I want hot dogs” stands in relation to a chemical analysis of the burninglogs in my backyard. That is, invoking divine creativity and purpose would lie at"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"3Isfine-tuning remarkable?37a distinct level of understanding, incommensurate but not incompatible with thoseof the sciences. And it could not be mapped directly onto any scientific accounts.Theology claims to explain things at a deeper level than physical causation, and thedeeper explanation would simply not show up, nor should one expect it to do so,while one is setting forth, say, biochemical pathways leading to life.Analogously, if one were to ask why life appeared on earth at all, even themost painstaking analysis of the physical and chemical fine-tuning required for thiseventuality would uncover no purposiveness or divine intention at the many levels ofscientific inquiry. Science abstracts from questions of purpose or ultimate meaning.Nevertheless, abundant logical space would still exist for a theological explanationat another level of understanding. Life, it could be said without any inconsistency,arose because of the properties of water (Henderson,1913; Denton,1998, pp.22–46), the stellar formation of carbon (Burbidgeet al., 1957), precisely tunedcosmic constants (Rees,2000), physical and chemical peculiarities (Northrop,1979,pp. 168–205),and alsobecause of the creative power of an Infinite Goodness. Justas it is not incoherent to say – all at the same time – that the fire is burning in mybackyard because of chemical processes,andbecause it was ignited by a match,andbecause I want hot dogs, logically speaking plenty of non-competitive room exists,at least in principle, for a theological understanding of life to co-exist comfortablyalongside scientific accounts. The only requirement is that the various layers notbe logically inconsistent with one another.Furthermore, contrary to E. O. Wilson’s expectations, for theology to have deepexplanatory value, its understanding of lifecannotbe spelled out in objectifyingscientific language any more than “I want hot dogs” needs to be expressed in theidiom of chemical combustion. Indeed, the language of truly deep explanationmustbe that of symbol, metaphor, and analogy because it refers to a reality moreencompassing than anything that we humans can bring into objectifying focus.Only a narrow commitment to explanatory monism – a contraction that can bejustified by no available scientific evidence – would lead to a rejection of the richlylayered model of understanding I am proposing here (and which Aristotle andother philosophers have proposed for centuries). Of course, the option to take theroad of layered explanation is a fiduciary leap, but it seems to me to be a morereasonable kind of leap than the option for explanatory monism. As it casts a widernet, explanatory pluralism is less likely to leave out essential causal factors thanexplanatory monism, even if it still leaves the world looking a lot fuzzier at itsfoundations than a strict reductionist would prefer.And yet, a theology comfortable with explanatory pluralism will still encourageall the sciences to push their own purely natural, and inevitably reductive, expla-nations as far as possible at their own appropriate levels of investigation. Good"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"38John F. Haughttheology avoids any attempt to make room for divine action in the dark regions ofyet uncharted scientific levels of inquiry. This is because its sense of layered expla-nation can, in principle, make ample room for theological explanation at levels morefundamental, metaphysically speaking, than those at which science functions. Andso, without in any way contradicting elaborate physical, chemical, or evolutionaryaccounts of life, theology may be justified in claiming that chemistry is fine-tunedto life ultimately because of the infinite generosity and wisdom of God. But it doesnot expect to discover the finger of God anywhere in, or even at the temporal begin-ning of, the series of physical and biochemical causes that seem suggestive of afine-tuning for life.That room still exists for a deeper probing by theology after science has detailedthe fitness of the cosmos and its complex chemistry for life is suggested by the factthat so many scientists themselves view fine-tuning as remarkable: that is, they havean intuition that something deeper is going on in nature than science itself can bringinto focus. In recent years, as a matter of fact, it is scientists more than theologianswho have noticed that the universe and earth appear to be remarkably fine-tunedfor life. Modern thought, influenced by a mechanistic philosophy of nature, wasnot ready for this discovery. Up until the 1970s, science had increasingly picturedlife as an anomaly in a pervasively lifeless and pointless universe. Jacques Monod’spopular bookChance and Necessity(1971) epitomized the long-standing materialistclaim that nature is essentially indifferent to life and intelligence. And much modernphilosophy, art, and religious thought have taken shape in support of, or reactionto, that assumption.But now, many scientists working at diverse scales from microphysics to astron-omy have noted in a way they never did before that the universe, apparently fromthe beginning, was put together in a series of close calls that made it just right forthe emergence of living and thinking beings (Davies,1992). Hence, the universe nolonger seems essentially lifeless and mindless. And, as other chapters in this volumepoint out, nature’s biochemical details and the terrestrial environment as a wholeprovide a nest seemingly designed for life. So impressive is the still-accumulatinginformation about the many emergent levels of the world’s fine-tuning for life thatsome scientists can hardly suppress a suspicion that something momentous, perhapseven purposive, is afoot in the cosmos.But one must be cautious. At what level should the explanation of the fine-tuningfor life – in terms of the notion of purpose – be located? And what exactly does itmean to say that it is fine-tuned for life? Few scientists doubt that physics, chemistry,and terrestrial ecology are just right to sponsor the adventure of life. However, as Inoted earlier, what is most interesting and most at issue, at least when all the dustclears, is whether nature has beenintentionallyprepared for life. And, is science as"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"3Isfine-tuning remarkable?39such ever really equipped to answer the deep question of whether intentionality orpurpose is involved at any level?I believe not, especially because the scientific method, as such, deliberately leavesout considerations of purpose. If, in their more popular essays on the implicationsof science, scientists hold forth on the question of purpose in nature, it is not asscientists, but as (usually amateur) philosophers that they do so. And that theyattempt to draw philosophical conclusions directly out of the data of science issometimes indicative more of a prior commitment to explanatory monism than ofa genuine respect for the integrity of science.And yet, an intriguing sense of the remarkableness of life persists among sci-entists themselves, including evolutionists. Remarkableness, as much as some sci-entists try to disown its power, still remains the muse of biology, as well as ofall other sciences. In his extensive research on the phenomenon of evolutionaryconvergence, the paleobiologist Simon Conway Morris, an editor of this volume,has noted that “words like ‘remarkable’, ‘striking’, ‘extraordinary’, or even ‘aston-ishing’, and ‘uncanny’ are commonplace” in the literature (2003,p.128). In otherwords, scientists have an incentive to embark on their research programs only ifthey somehow find nature astonishing. In fact, it was clearly his own experience ofthe remarkableness of convergence that led Conway Morris to challenge StephenJay Gould’s conviction that chance was the determining factor in evolution. Gouldhad claimed that if the “tape” of terrestrial life’s evolution were rewound and playedagain, the results would be completely different next time around (1989,p.50). Thisis because, for Gould, the deepest causes of life’s various forms were “contingent,”or purely accidental events in natural history (such as climatic changes and massextinctions). Like most evolutionists, Conway Morris gave a place to chance, buthe disagreed with Gould’s enshrinement of contingency as the ultimate cause ofevolutionary outcomes. He tracked numerous instances of convergence, in whichindependent, ancestrally unrelated lines of evolutionary adaptation have led timeand again to similar physiological outcomes. If the tape of evolution were replayed,the results might be different in some details the next time around, Conway Morrisallowed, but generally speaking the consequences would be quite similar to whatthey turned out to be this time. In any case, life is not a simple lottery in which lifeforms follow no restrictive corridors of development.It is “remarkable” to Conway Morris, for instance, that more than a dozen mole-like burrowing (fossorial) animals from around the world exhibit closely compa-rable bodily features, even though they belong to entirely different species (2003,pp. 139–44). The rapacious teeth of some predatory marsupials are nearly iden-tical in structure to those of certain placental animals, although their respectiveevolutionary courses unfolded oceans apart. In species that are clearly unrelated,"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"40John F. Haughtphylogenetically speaking, the eyes, snouts, auditory mechanisms, and otherattributes have developed independently any number of times in nearly the sameway, following similar biochemical and morphological pathways. Such similaritiescannot be due either to sheer coincidence, since the likenesses are so pronounced,or to genetic inheritance, since they occur in unrelated phyla. Biology exhibits somany instances of convergence that something other than sheer accident must beinvolved; thus, Gould must be wrong. It is almost as though “evolutionary hyper-spaces” – the possible forms in which life can clothe itself – have been laid outin advance, and their number is finite. Clearly, constraints bear on the possibleroutes one might imagine life having taken. Organisms can try on any numberof virtual outfits, and alterations can be made; but the tailoring is not infinitelymalleable.It is not my place to pass judgment on the accuracy or inaccuracy of ConwayMorris’ claims. However, it seems appropriate to ask for an explanation of the limitsthat constrain life to the point of permitting so much convergence. It does not seemsufficient to invoke the idea of adaptation by natural selection exclusively because,by itself, that idea is too wide-ranging to be helpful. No matter what outcomesoccur in evolution, the ultra-adaptationist will insist that the explanation must be“natural selection.” This may be true in a general sense, but appealing to the ideaof selection lies at the same level of vagueness as a meteorologist’s claiming thatthe laws of physics are the cause of this afternoon’s thunderstorm.Life, to those who have no stomach for layered explanation, is generalizable asmerely “simplicitymasqueradingas complexity” (Atkins,1992). But to those whofind life remarkable, a search for a deeper explanation is in order, since explanatorymonism seems too shallow and too vague to capture most of what is actually goingon in the universe. However, one needs to avoid reaching for theological explanationtoo early in the search. Layered explanation allows us to avoid a precipitous rushto bring in theological or quasi-theological categories such as Intelligent Designwhile plenty of room is available for scientific clarification. Correspondingly, iftheology is to offer any explanation as far as fine-tuning is concerned, it shouldnot be introduced prematurely or on those levels of methodological self-restrictionwhere scientific research is being carried out. Such an intrusion would be just onemore appeal to “God of the gaps” (i.e. God’s role is limited to accounting for the“gaps” in scientific explanations of nature).However, if one takes the approach of layered explanation, theological under-standing might be relevant at vertically deeper layers of understanding than those atwhich the physical and biological sciences normally function. The sense of remark-ableness, I believe, arises from the fact that the scientist’s consciousness, no lessthan that of other human beings, is somehow already in the grasp of a dimly intuitedneed forultimateexplanation. But theology cautions science not to be too hasty"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"3Isfine-tuning remarkable?41in identifying or clarifying nature’s deepest dimension. It is better instead to allowthe sense of uneasiness that “something more” is involved to remain alive andunresolved as a spur to ever-deeper exploration. I have argued elsewhere that someevolutionists prematurely give to the notion of natural selection a metaphysicallyfoundational status, and that this assignment actually inhibits more penetratinginquiry into the depths of nature (Haught,2003). I would urge the same caution herewith respect to the temptation to give exclusively naturalist accounts of fine-tuning,fitness, and convergence. Allowing for theological or metaphysical explanation atdeeper levels than those at which science works delivers science from the burdenof having to come up with the ultimate explanation.And yet, scientists are human beings, and it is natural for all of us to look for theultimate explanation, especially when things seem surprising. The “frequency ofadjectival surprise associated with descriptions of convergence,” Conway Morrissays, “suggests to me that there is almost a feeling of unease in these similarities”(2003,p.128). He suspects that some biologists “sense the ghost of teleologylooking over their shoulders,” and he does not consider this to be an “unworthysentiment” (2003,p.128). Convergence has an “eeriness” that makes it plain thathuman inquiry still has a long way to go until it gets to the bottom of evolution (2003,p. 128). Something more than chance, selection, or the sheer passage of time must beinvolved in the outcomes of earth’s life processes. What the “something else” mightbe, however, Conway Morris does not specify, and since other explanatory levelsare available outside of science to account in a deeper way for remarkableness, itis not his task as a scientist to do so.As a scientist, Conway Morris seems quite aware that he is not supposed todabble in metaphysics. Yet, in hisLife’s Solutionhe provides more than a hintof the need for explorations of life by metaphysics and theology. Still, I believeConway Morris considers these explorations to be supplemental to those of scienceas such, and he does not conflate religious allusions with his detailed scientificpresentation of the evidence for convergence. Knowing that it is not his task to dotheology, contrary to the suspicions of some of his critics (e.g. Prothero,2003), heisnotdoing violence to science by pointing out, at least by implication, the need foralternative levels of explanation to account fully for life’s remarkableness. In fact,by his explicitly allowing for a theology of evolution in addition to the science ofevolution, one could make the case that he is safeguarding the integrity of science.By explicitly making room for theological investigation of life at a level distinctfrom science, he can more easily let science be just science than can some of hiscritics. Unlike evolutionists such as Gould, Dawkins, and Prothero, all of whom arecontent to force a materialist ideology into the single explanatory slot of scientificunderstanding, Conway Morris seems to be aware of the need to decouple strictlyscientific work from statements of belief. By at least implicitly allowing for an"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"42John F. Haughtexplanatory pluralism, he can provide scientific inquiry with much more immunityto metaphysics than evolutionists that either unconsciously or deliberately conflatescientific ideas with materialist ideology.Is fine-tuning remarkable?How does this discussion of Conway Morris apply to the issue of fine-tuning: thefitness of the cosmos, earth, and chemistry to the emergence of life? Isn’t this set ofphysical factors also “remarkable” enough to suggest that conventional scientificaccounts are leaving something out by way of explanation? I believe that we alsoneed to approach this question with an openness to layered explanation. Sciencealone, after all, has a habit of reducing remarkableness to mere routine at its ownlevels of inquiry. This reduction, when confined to the scientific method, strictlyspeaking, does not seem inappropriate. Science rightly tries to bring a largely hiddenconcatenation of natural causes out of darkness into the light of day, and once theunbroken sequence is exposed, the seemingly supernormal fa ̧cade pales into blandnormality. This is how science works.However, the stronger claim that, in the end, nothing in nature can still be remark-able after science has done its work is not so much a characteristic of science itselfas it is of the belief system known as “scientific naturalism.” Scientific naturalistsstrongly believe that nature is all there is. If nothing else exists besides nature,it follows that nature must be self-originating. Moreover, if the natural world isnot rooted in any creative agency beyond itself, there can be no end or goal thatwould give overarching purpose to the universe. According to scientific naturalists,the whole scheme of things is pointless, even considering local pockets of purelyhuman meaning. Nor is there room for miracles or divine responsiveness to prayer.Finally, with no divine causation, all causes must be purely natural, and every nat-ural event is the consequence of other natural events (Hardwick,1996). Thus, allphenomena, however astonishing they may at first appear, are ultimately unremark-able – that is, natural. Otherwise, the naturalist belief system would be exposed asincoherent. Accordingly, cognitional satisfaction cannot occur until one has arrivedat the cold consequence that nothing is really remarkable after all. “Remarkable” isat most a temporary sticker, to be removed once the purely natural causes of thingshave become manifest.In our own time, scientific naturalism is alluring to scientists and philosophersalike. The self-avowed materialist Nicholas Humphrey clearly exemplifies the sci-entific naturalist’s longing to reduce the remarkable to the routine. In his bookLeapsof Faith(1996), he tries to show that what may at first seem supernormal, and hencean invitation to adopt a non-materialist understanding of the world, always turnsout, on closer inspection, to be completely normal, and therefore just one more"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"3Isfine-tuning remarkable?43defeat for supernormalism. Like James Randi, the famous debunker of Uri Geller’sallegedly paranormal feats of magic, Humphrey considers it not only the scientist’sbut also the philosopher’s responsibility to demonstrate that any natural phenomenathat seem to exhibit intelligent design and fine-tuning are really normal or routine.For Humphey, fine-tuning as described in the present volume would be just one ofthe many “appearances” that, once we see through them, are really not remarkableat all.Humphrey has a lot of company in the intellectual world today. Owen Flana-gan, a well-known philosopher at Duke University, even goes so far as to declarethat the main purpose of academic philosophy is to “make the world safe for nat-uralism” (2002, pp. 167–8). Nevertheless, even the most naturalistic of scientistsand philosophers at least begin their inquiries into specific areas of research onlywhen they find certain things remarkable enough to engage their interest. Withoutthe horizon of a yet unknown world stretching out tantalizingly ahead, scientificexploration could not even get started. Nor could it continue unless the summonsto explore the unknown keeps reappearing on the horizon with each advance. It isstill an open question, therefore, whether all that we find initiallyremarkableisdestined eventually to becomeroutine.An appropriate question for theology, therefore, is why the world remainscontinually remarkable and often becomes even more so as science progressesin its understanding. And what, moreover, would make fine-tuning remarkableenough to be both an interesting topic for research and something deservingof ceaseless (theological) amazement? To many scientists, even after they havereduced it scientifically to purely natural processes, fine-tuning remains – againat a deeper level than science alone can reach – no less eerie and astonishingthan evolutionary convergence is to the likes of Conway Morris. Otherwise, itwould not be drawing so much attention. What is it, then, that arouses the scien-tist’s – or, for that matter, anybody’s – interest? What is it that invites theologicalcomment?As mentioned previously, one factor is a sense of contingency, a realizationthat many outcomes are possible, but that these possibilities are constrained atevery step by pruning principles. A sense of contingency arises because the cosmicor biochemical fine-tuning prior to and underlying life might very well not haveoccurred at all. And the natural events leading up to life did not have to takeplace exactly the way they did. The scientist’s capacity to entertain counterfactualworlds is possible only because of a prior sense that contingency is involved in thephysical unfolding of the world. That is, alternative sets of physical occurrencesare theoretically possible, even though most of them would not have led to life.One reason for sensing remarkableness, then, is the apparent lack of inevitabilitythat scientists are now discerning in the physical prehistory of life."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"44John F. HaughtContingency means “absence of necessity,” and so a contingent event is anyoccurrence that has actually taken place but did nothaveto take place. Contingencyis inevitably remarkable as it gives rise to the question of why this or that happened ifit did not have to happen at all. If one arrives at the point of realizing that somethinghadto happen, and that it had to happen the way it did, then there would be nomore room for questioning. Thus, understandably, one important wing of scientificnaturalism – let us call it “right-wing naturalism” – tries to eliminate remarkablenessby mentally transforming all impressions of contingency into a sense of inevitability.Acknowledging overriding necessity leaves no room for astonishment.Right-wing naturalists strive to eliminate remarkableness from nature by dem-onstrating that all natural phenomena, beneath any initial appearance to the con-trary, are the consequence of an underlying physical necessity. According to thephilosopher Daniel Dennett, for example, the rich display of novelty and livingdiversity in evolution is really nothing more than the outcome of an algorithmic(mathematically inevitable) process (1995, pp. 48–60). Apparently, it is the voca-tion of the right-wing scientific naturalist to help us put aside all childish wonderand become resigned to the inherent unremarkableness of nature. In my opinion,however, such a project can be carried out successfully only where a sense of deeplylayered explanation has already been suppressed. Just what motives lie behind thescientific naturalist’s often passionate suppression of explanatory pluralism is atopic deserving of a separate study.However, a left-wing variety of scientific naturalism is also operating in today’sworld. Looking for a world shorn of abiding wonder, some scientists and philoso-phers are inclined to enshrine absolute contingency rather than physical necessityin the role of final explanation. In contemporary debates about how to account forevolutionary outcomes, a major issue is whether the ultimate cause of evolution-ary change is the rigorous necessity of adaptation by natural selection or perhapsthe irrational contingencies in natural history. Gould, to cite the most prominentrepresentative of contingency proponents, claims that it is especially accidental,undirected events such as meteorite impacts, earthquakes, and climatic changesthat explain the uniqueness of living organisms and species. Yet he shares with hismore deterministic adversaries the same compulsion to eliminate remarkableness atall costs. In Gould’s case, the reduction is not so much to routine as toirreducibleunintelligibility, but the result is the same: life is no longer remarkable becauseits absolute origin has now been revealed. In spite of what seem to be irresolv-able conflicts between them, the respective devotees of Dawkins and Gould mayappreciate that both evolutionists, though taking different routes, end up exorcis-ing any open-ended mystery from the story of life. For both factions, an allegedlyscientific category, whether chance or necessity, functions in fact as a metaphysicalexplanation, rendering theology obsolete."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"3Isfine-tuning remarkable?45Conclusion: nature as narrativeIbelieve that the notions of chance and necessity, however, are both lifeless mentalabstractions that fail to do justice in any way to the deeper fact that nature is astory that blends contingency, law, and time into something truly remarkable andunrepeatable. It is this narrative aspect of nature that I would want to reflect onif I were in search of something irreducibly remarkable about the universe andevolution. For scientific naturalists, chance and necessity are each apotheosized,ironically not unlike the deities of an ancient mythic pantheon. In fact, “chance”and “necessity” are really abstract terms that have been reified in such a way asto miss altogether the concretely narrative quality of natural reality. On the onehand, “chance,” “accident,” and “randomness” are terms that point only obliquelyto nature’s concrete, contingent openness to indeterminate future outcomes. Onthe other hand, “necessity” is a misleading label for the underlying consistency oflawful constraints that limit possibility. In the real world, “contingent” opennessnever exists independently of the habitually constraining and lawful consistency(misnamed “necessity”) that gives continuity to nature in its narrative passagethrough time.What remains indelibly remarkable, therefore, is not so much life’s or the envi-ronment’s fine-tuning, or evolutionary convergence, for that matter, but the delicateblend of openness, constraint, and temporality that clothes the cosmos with drama.It is this combination that most appropriately invites theological comment. What iseerie, astonishing, and amazing – and utterly irreducible to routine – is that natureis narrative to the core, and that the story is not over. Nature is not a state, butahistorical genesis, a process of becoming, an epic still being told. And so wewill never get to the bottom of fine-tuning and evolution until we have understoodwhy their matrix is narrative and where the story is leading. Contrary to the tenetsof naturalism, I doubt that the natural sciences can answer this question at theirownlevels without also leaving ample room for theological conjecture at its ownappropriate level.Fine-tuning is remarkable, then, primarily because it is situated within the morefoundational context of a cosmic story. The tuning, after all, is never really as fineas it initially seems. If it were, necessity and rigidity would have locked life intoeternal stasis – a kind of death, in other words. Nature would no longer have astory to tell. Order without novelty is meager monotony. But, blessedly, an open-ness to possibility still exists (inaptly called “contingency”) that pierces throughthe armored consistency in natural processes. In evolution, this openness consistsin part of the very imperfections inherent in biological adaptations. Nature mustbe open to the future if it is to avoid metamorphosing into hard-rock necessity.Its imperfections assist in keeping it open to the future. To an earlier and now"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"46John F. Haughtpass ́ebrand of Darwinism, it was a theological scandal that no adaptations wereperfect, as imperfection spoiled the idea of an Intelligent, Divine Designer. Butthe idea of Intelligent Design is itself just another abstract idea originating inour human tendency to disassociate order from the openness that makes naturenarrative. As it turns out, the imperfection of organic adaptation is essential ifthe story is to keep going and to remain interesting. If nature is narrative, wemust remark at how fortunate it is that adaptation and design are not comfortablycomplete.On the other hand, openness to transformation does not mean absolute inde-terminateness, as fine-tuning and biological convergence show. A finite range ofpossibilities and a channeling aspect to evolution exist and keep life from splashingout all over the place in completely unrestrained “hyperspace.” The morphologiesassumed by life, whether on earth or elsewhere, seem to be finite in number. Life isopen to possibility, but possibility is not limitless. Otherwise, the story would haveno continuity. Evolution arises in a narrative matrix, and narrative requires habitu-alness and redundancy, along with novelty, to keep the life-journey from collapsingat any capricious moment into complete confusion.Contingency, if one wishes to use this abstract term, is remarkable because itadds historicity and dramatic suspense to recurrent natural processes. Right-wingnaturalism looks for the strain of lawful necessity (and hence predictability) inall natural occurrences, and so it is naturally uneasy with contingency. Contin-gency means uniqueness, singularity, specificity, and unrepeatability, and these alldefy sheer generality and reductive simplicity. To fulfill its objective of exposingremarkableness as mere routine, therefore, right-wing scientific naturalism mustat least implicitly deny that contingency is anything more than necessity not yetunderstood.When it appears in combination with nature’s habitualness, contingency isremarkable. But when it is absolutized as an independent and ultimate explanation,contingency is equivalent to unintelligibility or absurdity. At the point of being thusmaximized, contingency, no less than necessity, banishes remarkableness from theworld. The typical way of exorcising remarkableness is the right-wing naturalist’sreduction of contingency to necessity, but as this objective is unachievable, anotherwayofmuffling surprise and awe is found in left-wing naturalism – namely, toexaggerate contingency to the point of making pure chance the ultimate explana-tion of the most momentous natural occurrences. I have been proposing, however,that both kinds of naturalism, because of their explanatory monism, can thrive onlyin an illusory and imaginative world of ideas quite cut off from the actual narrativeflow of nature itself. And it is this narrative, a story that wends we know not where,that remains forever remarkable and that gives theology a permanent place in thehuman quest for deep explanation."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"3Isfine-tuning remarkable?47ReferencesAtkins, P.

For metaphysics is the spectralscience, silent and invisible, often slighted and frequently despised. But howevercontemned, it is always hovering and lurking about the premises; and for thatreason it is not much welcome by scientists, most of whom greet metaphysics theway Jane Eyre reacted to the screams she heard emanating from the attic. JohnBarrow captures this uneasiness of physicists facing metaphysical questions veryneatly in a passage that also explains why the inherently philosophical questionswon’t go away, no matter how uneasy scientists might feel about them:[The] tendency of fundamental physics to move towards questions traditionally of interestto philosophers and theologians has developed in parallel with an increased lack of interestamongst physicists in the philosophical questions raised by these developments. To mostscientists [the phrase] “philosophical questions” has become a handy label to apply to anycollection of vague or apparently unanswerable questions which only become worthy ofserious consideration when they become scientific.(Barrow,1990,p.2)Nor is this uneasiness, which sometimes borders on outright contempt, utterlyimplausible.

Something similar holds true for science’s ethical and environmental impact as well, but the widerimplications of those issues do not fall within the focus of this chapter.2In other words, the situation is now the reverse of the one that obtained at the dawn of modernity, when philosophyserved as the midwife to science. Even as late as Ren ́e Descartes and Isaac Newton, the sciences they pursuedwere still called “natural philosophy.” In fact, the word “scientist” had not even been invented until the nineteenthcentury, by William Whewell in1840,inadeliberate act of coinage, although the word also appeared in passing(only to be rejected for its ugliness) in an 1834 article in theQuarterly Review:Science . . loses all traces of unity. A curious illustration of this result may be observed in the want of any nameby which we can designate students of the knowledge of the material world collectively.

The result was that when the sciences finally felt liberatedfrom the apron strings of philosophy (and not just terminologically) they often took on an anti-metaphysicalpolemic; and philosophy, to the extent that it suffered from what was facetiously called “physics envy,” adoptedthat same animus against metaphysics, especially in the school known as Logical Positivism.

As portrayed by the Polish writer LeszekKolakowski the contrast between philosophy and science could hardly be starker:For centuries philosophy has asserted its legitimacy by asking and answering questionsinherited from the Socratics and Pre-Socratics: how to distinguish the real from the unreal,true from false, good from evil . . . There came a point, however, when philosophers hadto confront a simple, painfully undeniable fact: thatof the questions which have sustainedEuropean philosophy for two and a half millennia, not a single one has been answeredto general satisfaction. All of them, if not declared invalid by the decree of philosophers,remain controversial. It is just as possible, culturally and intellectually, to be a nominalistor an anti-nominalist today as it was in the twelfth century; no odder now than in ancientGreece to believe or deny that phenomena can be distinguished from essences, no moreunusual to hold that the distinction between good and evil is a contingent one, a matter ofconvention, than to claim that it is embedded in the necessary order of things. Belief andnon-belief in God are equally respectable; no norms of our civilization prevent us fromclaiming that language creates reality or the other way around; we shall not be barred fromgood society because we embrace or reject the semantic conception of truth.(Kolakowski,2001, pp. 1–2 [emphasis added])Obviously, scientists cannot endure such methodological and ideological chaosin their chosen specialties. That is also why, by the way, no matter how muchpostmodern epistemologists hurl challenges at the validity of science, scientiststhemselves rarely betray any lack of confidence in their work or in the results of theirresearch and experimentation. Leave the death-wishes to philosophers, they seem tobe saying, we need to get on with our work.3And who can blame them? Philosophyseems largely devoted to proclaiming its own death, rather like those theologiansof the death-of-God school. But what science ever acts as philosophy does?For well over a hundred years, a large part of academic philosophy has been devoted tothe business of explaining that philosophy is either impossible or useless or both. Thusphilosophy demonstrates that it can happily survive its own death [by keeping] itself busytrying to prove that it has indeed died . . . There is an immense variety of unconnectedphilosophical paths, all converging at one point – that of anti-philosophy. The farewell tophilosophy, like the “bye-bye” in a famous Laurel and Hardy scene, never ends. The issues3Needless to say, philosophers can sometimes reciprocate with a kind of “you can’t fire me because I quit”attitude, as in this rather peremptory dismissal of the scientist’s dismissal of philosophy from the journals ofLudwig Wittgenstein:It is all one to me whether or not the typical scientist understands or appreciates my work, since he will not in anycase understand the spirit in which I write. Our civilization is characterized by the word ‘progress.’ Progress isits form rather than making progress being one of its features. Typically it constructs. It is occupied with buildingan ever more complicated structure. And even clarity is sought only as a means to this end, not as an end initself. For me on the contrary clarity, perspicuity are values in themselves. I am not interested in constructing abuilding so much as in having a perspicuous view of the foundations of possible buildings. So I am not aimingat the same target as the scientists and my way of thinking is different from theirs.(Wittgenstein,1980,p.7e)On the other hand, Wittgenstein could be pretty harsh about philosophy too: “Reading the Socratic dialoguesone has the feeling: what a frightful waste of time! What’s the point of these arguments that prove nothing andclarify nothing?” (id., p. 14e)."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"52Edward T. Oakesthat once formed the kernel of philosophical reflection – being and non-being, good and evil,myself and the universe – seem to have been shunted aside, relegated, except as subjectsof historical enquiry, to a corner of academia, almost as dark as that occupied by God inschools of Divinity or sex in Victorian conversation.(Kolakowski,2001, pp. 7–8)There is also a further worry that needs to be mentioned: metaphysics is oftenreligious in its claims.4In fact, Aristotle called “metaphysics” (the word itself wasa coinage of post-Aristotelian librarians) not only “first philosophy,” but morecrucially “theology.”5And the episodes of theology dictating to science (or to“natural philosophy,” as it used to be called) are long, well antedating Galileo.One notices this in a remark of Moses Maimonides (AD 1135–1204) in his famousGuide for the Perplexed, where he scores this aggressiveness by theology to dictateresults and which he detected in some of his Christian and Muslim predecessors:It is not our object to criticize things which are peculiar to either creed, or books which werewritten exclusively in the interest of one community or the other. We merely maintain thatthe earlier theologians, both of the Greek Christians and of the Muslims, when they laiddown their propositions, did not investigate the real properties of things; first of all, theyconsidered whatmustbe the properties of the things which should yield proof for or againsta certain creed; and when this was found they asserted that the thing must be endowedwith those properties; then they employed the same assertion as a proof for the identicalarguments which had led to the assertion, and by which they either supported or refuted acertain opinion.6Yet, despite both the simultaneous chaos of philosophy and the repeated acts ofaggression perpetrated on science by metaphysical theology, I shall be claiminghere that metaphysical claims and implications won’t go away, no matter howanxious that makes scientists feel.7This uneasiness might seem to be most acuteamong physicists, for cosmology ineluctably raises question after question that, at4Even among avowedly anti-metaphysical philosophers, one can find some astonishing admissions of religiousintent. Wittgenstein again: “What is good is also divine. Queer as it sounds, that sums up my ethics. Onlysomething supernatural can express the supernatural” (Wittgenstein,1980,p.3e).5The phrase “ta meta ta phusika” merely means “what comes after [Aristotle’s treatise] thePhysics,” which couldimply only the placement of this book right after thePhysicsin the collection of Aristotle’s corpus of collectedworks. Aristotle himself called this branch of philosophy “first philosophy” because it dealt with first causesand immovable substances, so that “the science which deals with them must be prior, and must accordingly becalled ‘first philosophy’” (Aristotle,1984,Metaphysics, Book Epsilon 1, 1026a29–30). But for Aristotle thatsame first philosophy must also be called “theology” because “the science which it would be most proper forgods to possess is a divine science, and so too is any science which deals with the divine items. But this presentscience [of first causes] alone has these two features: the gods are held to be among the causes of all things andto be their first principles, and either the gods alone or the gods above all others can possess this science” (id.,Book Alpha 2, 983a6–9).6Maimonides,1928, pp. 109–10. This observation represents an unusually prescient anticipation of the method-ology of the Intelligent Design movement, as will become clear as these reflections proceed.7Kolakowski again: “But such things, although we may shunt them aside, ban them from acceptable discourseand declare them shameful, do not simply go away, for they are an ineradicable part of culture. . . . Our sensibilityto the traditional worries of philosophy has not withered away; it survives subcutaneously, as it were, ready toreveal its presence at the slightest accidental provocation” (Kolakowski,2001,p.8)."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"4 Complexity in context53least at first blush, seem metaphysical: the place of chance in quantum physics, thenature of space and time as relative to each other, the role of observership in theconstitution of reality, the paradoxes of the anthropic principle, and so forth. Buteven a quick glance at the debates raging inside biology shows how those debatesare frequently determined by issues primarily philosophical, not biological –to the palpable unease of many biologists. In the wake of the discovery of thehelical structure of DNA, biologists might well feel confident that they have finallyexpelled such allegedly metaphysical notions as ́elan vital, soul, and even “life”(as an extra-biological concept) from their conceptual armory; but uncomfortableissues remain lurking in the attics of the biological sciences.Ta ke, for example, the pesky problem of teleology. Before publication of CharlesDarwin’sOn the Origin of Speciesin 1859, it was the common assumption ofeveryone from Aristotle to William Paley that the neck of the giraffe was “madefor” reaching vegetation atop tall trees, that eyes are “made for” seeing, and so forth.And since such complex formations like the eye could hardly have come about bymere chance, they must have been designed by a kind of divine foresight, just as awatch requires a clever watchmaker. However, with the appearance of theOrigin,that explanation fell into disarray and lost its hold on the scientific public, or so itis claimed. In fact the situation was far more complex than the received wisdomwould have it. Even avid Darwinians were not so sure. For example, Thomas Huxley(“Darwin’s bulldog”) saw Darwinism as the perfect opportunity to set up a secularreligion to rival Christianity, yet he still believed in “saltations” – big leaps inevolution to account for the transition from, say, fox to dog – and even claimedthat “there is a wider Teleology, that is not touched by the doctrine of Evolution.”8On the other side of the coin (and ocean), the Harvard botanist Asa Gray rightlyrecognized that saltations would mean the demise of the theory of natural selectionand vigorously defended Darwin in the New World; but he always remained anorthodox Congregationalist. In contrast, his great rival at Harvard, the zoologistLouis Agassiz, attacked theOriginroot and branch, but abandoned the Calvinistreligion of his Swiss homeland and became a Unitarian while at Harvard.9These catfights among the Darwinians continue right down to today. In order todrive home the point that evolution has no goal and that humans are a completefluke, the late Harvard professor Stephen Jay Gould insisted that if we rewound thetape of evolution and started the whole process over again, the chances would be8Much to Darwin’s annoyance, Huxley asserted his belief in saltations as early as his instant review of theOrigin,which appeared in the LondonTimeson Boxing Day in 1859 – the first review of theOriginto see print, amere thirty-two days after theOrigin’spublication date of 24 November 1859. His review “The DarwinianHypothesis” and his later essay of 1864, “Criticisms ofThe Origin of Species,” may both be found in Huxley,1893.9Details in Ruse (2003), pp. 142–3."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"54Edward T. Oakesvanishingly small of evolution producing, yet one more time, the same roaches andsharks, tulips and mushrooms, humans and crabs, that we know today. Of courseif the outcome of evolution werethatmuch of a fluke, then, as Daniel Dennettpoints out inDarwin’s Dangerous Idea, the search for intelligent life on otherplanets would be as pointless as a search for extraterrestrial kangaroos (see moreon Dennett’s point about this below). The whole point of such a search rests onthe assumption that evolution will inevitably tease out the potential for intelligencealready lurking, however embryonically, in the prebiotic chemical soup of otherlife-potential planets. But if intelligence is well-nigh inevitable, then does not suchinevitability say something about the inherent nature of the universe? If we wereso inevitable from the start, why the paroxysms of self-abasement about our flukeemergence, these pseudo-lachrymose sneers at man as an insignificant worm in thecosmic slime?What makes this debate, at root, a metaphysical one is its reliance on eitherimplicit or openly avowed metaphysical presuppositions. Even to make the claimhe did, Gould must have presupposed that it was meaningful to speak of “rewindingthe tape of evolution” or that one may meaningfully speak, after the event, of therelative weight that should be given to chance over necessity in the discussion ofbiological causality. Even to speculate on “what might have been” had tectonicplates arranged themselves differently (would kangaroos ever have evolved if theAustralian continent had stayed fused to the Antarctic land mass?) is to enter intoa realm of thought determined by modal verbs (“might have,” “could have,” andso forth); and the role of modal verbs in determining the structure of reality isitself a heated area of metaphysical debate among analytic philosophers. Similarly,the positing of chance and necessity in causal explanation already represents theintroduction of metaphysical categories.10It is the purpose of this chapter to try to explicate these metaphysical implications,above all as they pertain to biological complexity.Complexity leads to perplexity,goes the old saw in Introduction to Epistemology classes. Or more exactly: com-plexity inthingsleads to perplexity in themind.Even arrangements that are not,in and of themselves, terribly complex – such as a circle of ten stones forming abarrier for a campfire, for example – prompt the human mind almost spontaneouslyto imagine the presence of design. Let us take the case of Robinson Crusoe; butthis time let us not have this shipwrecked survivor, washed ashore on what seemsto be an uninhabited island, discovering a human footprint in the sand. Rather letus assume he comes across, in a forest clearing, a circle of stones: just as with the10Forexample, is “chance” but an admission that a cause is unknown by people or unintended by them, as Aristotle(and Albert Einstein) held and as ordinary language assumes when it speaks of automobile “accidents” (autoaccidents are hardly uncaused, just unintended)? Or are there really uncaused events in the universe, for exampleat the quantum level, and if so, how is that to be determined?"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"4 Complexity in context55footprint, so too with the stones – Crusoe knows that there is (or was) at least onehuman besides himself on the island.But far from resolving his initial perplexity after being washed ashore, the for-mation of the stones has still not really answered all his questions. For example, thefootprint in the sand surely indicates the recent presence of Man Friday on the island(the sand would have obliterated an old footprint). But assuming there is no ash, noburning embers, in the center of the stone formation, Crusoe has no idea when thecircle was made or what kind of human, hostile or friendly, made the campfire. Allhe knows, almost instinctively, as it were, is that such a circle could hardly haveformed itself (which means, in modern parlance, that the circle is not just complexbut “irreducibly” complex, a term discussed further below), and therefore that adesigner must have introduced – or rather, imposed – a mentally conceived formupon the stones scattered about nearby. Anything beyond that, however, leads onlyto further perplexity.Ihave decided to use this primitive example (primitive, obviously, in more waysthan one) because it highlights why and how arguments based on design can leadus astray. No one denies that the universe is complex, staggeringly so. Thus itseemed eminently sensible to extrapolate Crusoe’s logic to the universe: somethingas complex as the universe must have been so arranged as to allow not just theformation of stars, but also the chemical presuppositions of life – and adherents ofthe Intelligent Design (ID) movement go further and insist that the transition fromthe inorganic to the organic needed another “jump start” (which they call “abioticinfusion”) to account for the even greater complexity of life. But in the wake ofCharles Darwin’s theory of natural selection, this argument from design has beenshown to rest on an optical illusion, or rather, on a philosophical category mistake.“Irreducible complexity,” in other words, is not necessarily the same thing as whatI shall term here “staggering complexity.”11In my opinion, it is the great virtue of the theory of natural selection that it madeclear, for the first time, the distinction between irreducible and staggering complex-ity. Unfortunately, in too many minds – both Darwinian and anti-Darwinian – that11Ihave adopted the term “staggering complexity” from Dennett (1995), where he compares the Vast number ofpossible combinations of letters composing a book to the comparatively Vanishingly small number of lettersthat actually make up a book (he capitalizes Vast and Vanishing to highlight his idiosyncratic use of these terms,drawn from Jorge Luis Borges’ tale about the Library of Babel, a universe that contains all the possible books inthe world, a number so Vast that the currently existing books in the world are in comparison Vanishingly small).Similarly with the genetic code: thepossiblecombinations are Vastly large, but the onescurrently obtainingin the world are (in comparison) Vanishingly small. Why? Because just as not all books are worth reading (orwriting), in fact Vanishingly few are when set against the field of all possible books, similarly, Vanishingly fewgenetically coded “readouts” will result in a viable organism. However, those that result in viable organismswill seem Staggeringly complex when set against such relative simplicity as a circle of stones, which easilyleads to the logical fallacy that as the circle of stones was designed, thena fortiorithe eye must have been too.But once a pathway can be mapped to show how mutations drawn from Vast possibilities have been selected for,the apparent connection between irreducible and staggering complexity can be seen to result from an opticalillusion."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"56Edward T. Oakeslesson has not been learned. For too long it has been assumed that Darwin hadexpelledallforms of teleological understanding in biology, but that is going toofar.12Actually, in some ways the theory of natural selection gives new purchaseto the teleological mode of understanding. Even Charles Darwin himself (at leastin his better moments) knew as much. Try as he sometimes might (in his weakermoments) to expunge teleology from biological thought, he knew it couldn’t bedone; so he ended up with a rather muddled ambivalence:The term “natural selection” is in some respects a bad one, as it seems to imply consciouschoice; but this will be disregarded after a little familiarity. No one objects to chemistsspeaking of “elective affinity”; and certainly an acid has no more choice in combining witha base, than the conditions of life have in determining whether or not a new form be selectedor preserved.(Darwin,1868,Vol. I, p. 6)This passage tells us more than even Darwin himself seems to have divined. Forwhat he is highlighting here, perhaps without realizing it and certainly without thetechnical vocabulary necessary to make the point clear, is that one must distinguishbetween what ID advocates call “abiotic infusion” and what Aristotle calleden-telecheia(“entelechy”). Because this term is hardly a household word these days,perhaps the reader will allow me to cite this definition from the standard referencework for Greek philosophical terminology:Entelecheia:state of completion or perfection, actuality. Although Aristotle normally usesentelecheia, which is probably his own coinage, as a synonym forenergeia, there is a passage(Metaphysics1050a) that at least suggests that the two terms, though closely connected,are not perfectly identical. . . . The state of functioning (energeia) “tends toward” the stateof completion (en-telecheia).(Peters,1967,p.57)In other words, entelechy refers not just to an entity’s completed state, but morecrucially to its tendency to reach that state (whether that final state came to beas a result of chance, necessity, or a combination of the two is irrelevant to thepositing of a prior inherent possibility of the initial state to reach a final state).According to standard Aristotelian metaphysics, the assertion of the presence ofthis so-called entelechy does not require the positing of some extra element (suchas “abiotic infusion” or Henri Bergson’s ́elan vital)inthe structure. On the contrary,assertions of entelechy are but the recognition, in biological terms, of a priorlogicaltautology:posse sequitur esse. This phrase from medieval logic means: if somethingexists, then it was always possible for it to exist; and since a complex biologicalorganism is now before our investigating eyes, it must be based on a prior structurethat already had the capability (called “entelechy”) of reaching its complex finalstate.12“Did Darwin deal a ‘death blow to Teleology’, as Marx exclaimed, or did he show how the ‘rational meaning’of the natural sciences was to be empirically explained . . . thereby making a safe home in science for functionalor teleological discussion?” (Dennett,1995,p.126)."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"4 Complexity in context57Chemists might well speak of “elective affinity,” but what they mean by that ratheranthropomorphic term is what Aristotle more soberly meant by “entelechy”: thatchemical structures, under the right conditions, have an inherent, innate tendency toactualize themselves into structures of greater complexity. For after all, if they didnot have such an innate capacity in the first place, they never would have reachedtheir final, complex stage in the last place. This is what I shall call, without furtherado, the “metaphysical” structure of natural complexity. But I hasten to add that theterm “metaphysical” does not refer to some spooky “extra-physical” entity (like adesigning mind, abiotic infusion, vitalistic vapor, ́elan vital, whatever). Rather, itrefers simply to those logical prerequisites we must employ in order to understandchangeandidentity through time, growth, and development. And note as well thatthese logical presuppositions are operative no matter what position one takes aboutthelikelihoodof the emergence of complex formations from simpler elements.Whether the complex organism is quasi-inevitable, as when acorns result in oaktrees, or is highly unlikely, as when (by some accounts) carbon molecules firstbegin to replicate,13still the fact of later emergence always means there was a priorentelechy to make that later emergence possible.These logical substructures might seem tritely obvious, and in fact they are. Forthe only thing that these logical insights do is to highlight the necessary conceptualpresuppositions we must use when discussing change, growth, increasing complex-ity, identity through time in the midst of development, and so forth. But unless weadvert to these conceptual substructures inherent in any process of change, we arein danger of letting slip into our arguments false assumptions and faulty logic, suchas the elision made by William Paley in the late eighteenth and early nineteenthcenturies and by today’s ID advocates when they conflate “staggering” complexitywith “irreducible” complexity. But an equivalent metaphysical confusion must alsoreign among contemporary Darwinians, otherwise the debate over the radical con-tingency of the human species (Gould) against the virtual inevitability of intelligentlife emerging (Dennett) could never arise.Let us look at the actual conduct of the debate between these two men, for it isabove all in the specifics of their argument that their metaphysical presuppositionswill become clear. As we saw, Gould held that if we were to “rewind the tape ofevolution” and start the process all over again, the chances of something likeHomo13It is the entire burden of Robert Shapiro’sOrigins: A Skeptic’s Guide to the Creation of Life on Earth(Shapiro,1987)todefend the notion that the transition from primitive chemical bonds to self-replicating molecules isunlikely in the extreme. As an agnostic biochemist, Shapiro is not trying to introduce a design-argument by theback door; but he does insist that talk of Darwinian inevitability has no justification based on what we knowof organic chemistry. Nor is he much impressed with most scenarios on offer and he even links them, in theirformal logic and mode of argumentation, with the creationists: “Once the spirit of skepticism has been relaxedin the major paradigm of a scientific field, it is difficult to limit the process. Variants may then appear whichproclaim even more fanciful and spectacular solutions. The content of mythology increases. In the case of theorigin of life, we have seen that the Creationists mark the logical end point of this process” (Shapiro, 1967,p. 266)."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"58Edward T. Oakessapiensemerging again are next to infinitesimal. But what exactly does this mean?Let me take the example of bipedalism to show how the argument works in practice.In his bookThe Origin of Humankind, Richard Leakey calls the advent of bipedalismnot just a major biological, but also a major adaptive, transformation:The origin of bipedal locomotion is so significant an adaptation that we are justified in call-ing all species of bipedal ape “human”. This is not to say that the first bipedal ape speciespossessed a degree of technology, increased intellect, or any of the cultural attributes ofhumanity. It didn’t. My point is that the adoption of bipedalism was so loaded with evolu-tionary potential – allowing the upper limbs to be free to become manipulative implementsone day – that its importance should be recognized in our nomenclature. These humanswere not like us, but without the bipedal adaptation they couldn’t have become like us.(Leakey,1994,p.13)So far, so good. But what were the conditions that selected for bipedalism? Here isthe way Leakey summarizes one scenario:About 12 million years ago, a continuation of tectonic forces further changed the environ-ment, with the formation of a long, sinuous valley [in central Africa], running from northto south, known as the Great Rift Valley. The existence of the Great Rift Valley has hadtwo biological effects: it poses a formidable east-west barrier to animal populations, andit further promotes the development of a rich mosaic of ecological conditions. The Frenchanthropologist Yves Coppens believes the east-west barrier was crucial to the separateevolution of human and apes...[and] dubs this the “East Side Story.”(Leakey,1994, pp. 15–16)Let us assume for the sake of argument here that M. Coppens’ East Side Story isthe correct one. If it is, then it immediately raises the question: what would havehappened if these tectonic plates hadnotmoved in the way they did? Surely theformation of continents, mountain ranges, coastlines, and so forth follows no hard-and-fast rule of inevitability, any more than the weather does. Thus, if we rewoundonly that one shift of plates, presumably the conditions that led to bipedalism –and thus later to humans – would not have obtained. That in fact is also Leakey’sconclusion: “natural selection operates according to immediate circumstances andnot toward a long-term goal.Homo sapiensdid eventually evolve as a descendantof the first humans, but there was nothing inevitable about it” (Leakey,1994,p.20).Dennett counters this speculation with the retort that if such a view were true,the SETI Project (the once government-funded but now privately funded effort toSearch for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) would be pointless. Admittedly, that is noslam-dunk refutation, for perhaps such a projectispointless. But the assumption(hope? possibility?) that there is life in the universe besides our own could not evenbe entertained if one were simultaneously to subscribe, with Leakey, to the Gouldrewind-the-tape hypothesis. But, more crucially to the point at issue, Gould elidestwo kinds of contingency: the contingency of each human being emerging into life,"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"4 Complexity in context59and the contingency of life as suchand of its formal properties. Here is Dennett’sargument, where the distinction I am attempting to draw is put most lucidly:Just whatisGould’s claim about contingency? He says that “the most common misunder-standing of evolution, at least in lay culture,” is the idea that “our eventual appearance” is“somehow intrinsically inevitable and predictable within the confines of the theory.”Ourappearance? What does that mean? There is a sliding scale on which Gould neglects tolocate his claim about rewinding the tape. If by “us” he meant something very particular –Steve Gould and Dan Dennett, let’s say – then we wouldn’t need the hypothesis of massextinction to persuade us how luckyweare to be alive; if our two moms had never metour respective dads, that would suffice to consign us both to Neverland, and of course thesame counterfactual holds true of every human being alive today. Had such a sad misfor-tune befallen us, this would not mean, however, that our respective offices at Harvard andTufts would be unoccupied. It would be astonishing if the Harvard occupant’s name in thiscounterfactual circumstance was “Gould,” and I wouldn’t bet that its occupant would be ahabitu ́eofbowling alleys and Fenway Park, but Iwouldbet that its occupant would know alot about paleontology, would give lectures and publish articles and spend thousands of hoursstudying fauna . . . If, at the other extreme, by “us” Gould meant something very general,such as “air-breathing, land-inhabiting vertebrates,” he would probably be wrong . . . So wemay well suppose he meant something intermediate, such as “intelligent, language-using,technology-inventing, culture-creating beings.” This is an interesting hypothesis. If it istrue, then contrary to what many thinkers routinely suppose, the search for extra-terrestrialintelligence is as quixotic as the search for extra-terrestrial kangaroos – it happened once,here, but would probably never happen again. But [Gould’s book]Wonderful Lifeoffersno evidence in its favor; even if the decimations of the Burgess Shale fauna were random,whatever lineages happened to survive would, according to standard neo-Darwinian theory,proceed to grope toward the Good Tricks in Design Space.(Dennett,1995,p.307)14It cannot be the task of this chapter to adjudicate this Gould–Dennett debate. I amciting their debate only to point out that the issue could never even hope to beadjudicated without appeal to what I have called the “metaphysics of complexity.”By that I mean that, unless we have already determined what really constituteschance, change over time, complexification from simpler elements, inevitability vs.contingency in the emergence of life, and so on, we will never be able to understand,let alone adjudicate, debates among the Darwinians. In fact, most of those debatesonly arise because prior philosophical confusions have not been acknowledged andresolved.Now, I would not dream of disputing the claim that the deliverances of theempirical sciences will largely determine the outcome of this debate, but I wish to14By the term “Good Tricks in Design Space,” Dennett is referring to the inevitable constraints, both physicaland environmental, imposed by natural selection for an organism to thrive to reproductive age. Moreover, forhim these Good Tricks (his capitalization) lead to a kind of “arms race” of increasing complexity, makingthe emergence of intelligence well-nigh inevitable. In other words, Design Space constrains the Vast geneticpossibilities by the limits of viability in a particular environment; but more crucially, these constraints areformalconstraints, which, combined with the “arms race,” make intelligence, if not downright inevitable, certainly farlikelier than Gould would countenance."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"60Edward T. Oakeshighlight how much the debate is also – and inevitably – governed by metaphysicalpresuppositions that often go unnoticed. Just as advocates of ID (in my opinion)make a mistake of philosophical categorization when conflating “staggering com-plexity” with “irreducible complexity,” so too do the ultra-Darwinians when theyassume that Darwin expelled all forms of teleology from biology when in fact heonly refuted William Paley’s version of the argument from design.Toelucidate and expand on what I am driving at with this observation, I would liketo add one other point: why can’t Dennett be aligned with Gould that intelligenceis a “built-in” feature of evolutionary development yet also hold that intelligenceis unlikely anywhere else in the universe? Certainly there is nothing inherentlyimpossible, in the logical sense, with asserting both these positions. Such a thesisis, in fact, the gravamen of the recent book in evolutionary theory,Life’s Solution,bySimon Conway Morris (2003).15Perhaps the greatest virtue of this extraordinarilyvirtuous book is the author’s alertness to the massivephilosophicalmuddle of the(his word) “ultra-Darwinists”:Iamdriven to observe of the ultra-Darwinists the following features as symptomatic. First,to my eyes, is their almost unbelievable self-assurance, their breezy self-confidence. Second,and far more serious, are particular examples of a sophistry and sleight of hand in the misuseof metaphor, and more importantlya distortion of metaphysicsin support of an evolutionaryprogramme. Consider how ultra-Darwinists, having erected a naturalistic system that cannotby itself possess any ultimate purpose, still allow a sense of meaning mysteriously to slipback in . . . Third, as has often been noted, the pronouncement of the ultra-Darwinists canshake with a religious fervour. Richard Dawkins is arguably England’s most pious atheist.Their texts ring with high-minded rhetoric and dire warnings – not least of the unmitigatedevils of religion – all to reveal the path of simplicity and straight thinking. More thanone commentator has noted that ultra-Darwinism has pretensions to a secular religion,butitmay be noted that, however heartfelt the practitioners’ feelings, it is also withoutreligious or metaphysical foundations. Notwithstanding the quasi-religious enthusiasms ofultra-Darwinists, their own understanding of theology is a combination of ignorance andderision, philosophically limp, drawing on clich ́es, and happily fuelled by the idiocies of theso-called scientific creationists. It seldom seems to strike the ultra-Darwinists that theologymight have its own richness and subtleties, and might – strange thought – actually tell usthings about the world that are not only to our real advantage, but will never be revealedby science. In depicting the religious instinct as a mixture of irrational fundamentalism andwish-fulfilment they seem to be simply unaware that theology is not the domain of pop-eyedflat-earthers.(Conway Morris,2003, pp. 314–16 [emphasis added])Philosophical howlers and whoppers as egregious as those perpetrated by the ultra-Darwinians were bound to catch up with their advocates. And the reason is becausethe ultra-Darwinistsare indulging in precisely the kind of metaphysical speculationsthat they claim they are trying to expel.

In other words,theodicywas the real issue that led him to adopt an agnostic stance. But for the longest time,he saw that natural selection could be reconciled with Christian theism by using themedieval doctrine of secondary causality, a metaphysical doctrine that began withthe neo-Platonist figure Proclus (AD 410?–85) and was given classical expressionby St. Thomas Aquinas (AD 1225–74). As is well known, Darwin concluded theOriginwith a paean to secondary causes:Tomy mind it accords better with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by theCreator, that the production and extinction of the past and present inhabitants of the worldshould have been due to secondary causes, like those determining the birth and death of theindividual. When I view all beings not as special creations, but as the lineal descendantsof some few beings which lived long before the first bed of the Cambrian system wasdeposited, they seem to me to become ennobled.(Darwin,1928,p.462)Less well recognized, however, is the philosophical pedigree of this notion ofsecondary causality and the crucial role it has played in natural theology fromthe Middle Ages to the present. As the medieval historian of philosophy, ArmandMaurer, puts it:What is the nature of Darwin’s argument for evolution by secondary causes and what is itsvalue? It does not belong to science but to natural theology, for it concerns God the creatorand the laws he has implanted in matter. It should more properly be called metaphysical,for the argument turns on the distinction between primary and secondary causes, which aretraditionally the concern of metaphysics.(Maurer,2004,p.497)16Although it would be going much too far to say that Darwin’s theory of evolution bynatural selection helps to establish theism (Darwin’s own changing convictions inthat regard prove otherwise), it must none the less also be said that in certain wayshis theory provides added support for certain schools of natural theology that comeout of the Thomist (and Maimonidean) tradition, which holds that God is betterpraised by attributing natural events to natural causes rather than to God’s directinvolvement. Previously, both St. Augustine (AD 354–430) and St. Bonaventure(AD 1217?–74) had held that secondary causality, at least when taken too far,would denigrate God’s role in the world; so they posited something called “seminalpowers” (rationes seminales), asserting that nature cannot produce new effectsexcept by awakening the “seeds” God had originally planted in nature. They alsosubscribed to an epistemological equivalent of this doctrine, by asserting that there16This article traces both Darwin’s own personal exposure to the natural theology of secondary causes throughhis own reading and the genealogy of the concept from Proclus to the nineteenth century."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"62Edward T. Oakeswere also seminal powers in the human mind, so that the human mind cannot attainto the truth without a special illumination from God to awaken latent powers, like thesun turning seeds into plants. But Aquinas insisted that created beings do producenew substances by their own powers and do reach (some) truths by the light ofreason alone. As the renowned historian of medieval thought, Etienne Gilson, put itso well: “In St. Thomas man receives from God everything he receives [from God]in St. Augustine, but not in the same way. In St. Augustine God delegates his giftsin such a way that the very insufficiency of nature constrains it to return towardhim; in St. Thomas God delegates His gifts through the mediacy of a stable naturewhich containsin itself...the sufficient reason ofallits operations” (quoted inMaurer,2004, pp. 509–10 [emphasis added]).17Thomas’s criticism of the Augustinian version of natural theology is no doubtthe reason so many Thomists appreciate Darwin’s achievement and even see histheory as confirmation of Thomas’s theory of secondary causality.18This is alsowhy so many evolutionary biologists who are ardent Christians (or at least theists),such as Ronald Fisher and Theodosius Dobzhansky, explicitly rely on the notionof secondary causality.19Needless to say, the concept of secondary causality estab-lishes only the possible compatibility of evolution by natural selection with theism,not its actual compatibility. But the crucial point is that a denial of secondarycausality must be argued metaphysically, for nothing in evolution itself can implythe implausibility of secondary causes, and still less their impossibility. Darwinhimself recognized this as well in his autobiography, where he explicitly linked hisconstantly shifting opinions on God and Christianity with his gradual despair overthe human mind’s ability to reach metaphysical truths andnotwith his convictionof the truth of evolution:[I concede] the extreme difficulty or rather impossibility of conceiving this immense andwonderful universe, including man with his capacity of looking far backwards and far intofuturity, as the result of blind chance or necessity. When thus reflecting, I feel compelled tolook to a First Cause having an intelligent mind in some degree analogous to that of man;and I deserve to be called a Theist. This conclusion was strong in my mind about the time,as far as I can remember, when I wroteThe Origin of Species, and it is since that time thatit has, very gradually with many fluctuations, become weaker. But then arises the doubt –can the mind of man, which has, as I fully believe, been developed from a mind as low asthat possessed by the lowest animals, be trusted when it draws such grand conclusions?(Darwin,1892,p.66)17Maurer is quoting ́Etienne Gilson’s notes for a seminar in the Ecole Practique des Hautes Etudes, the Universityof Paris in 1920, printed as an Appendix in Shook, 1984, p. 297.18Nogar (1962) and Moreno (1990).19“Near the top of anyone’s list of the ‘ten greatest evolutionists since Darwin’ will be the English statisticianRonald Fisher . . . and the Russian-born American Theodosius Dobzhansky. . . . Both were ardent Christians”(Ruse,2001, pp. 8–9)."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"4 Complexity in context63On other occasions, Darwin would speak of the human mind’s capacity for meta-physics as being impaired by the fact of its origins in the primeval slime of the earlyearth, so that an evolution-produced mind trying to puzzle out metaphysical truthwas like “puzzling at astronomy without mechanics” or like trying to “illuminatethe midnight sky with a candle”: just as likely are we to expect that we might “throwthe light of reason on metaphysics” (Darwin,1974,p.71).I mention these remarks not to subscribe to Darwin’s views (to claim that theevolutionary origin of the human mind renders it incapable of attaining metaphysicaltruth requires argument, not mere assertion), but to point out that his variationsof opinion in matters of religion were directly related to his fluctuating stancetoward metaphysics, not evolution. Moreover, despite such diffidence, he never didsucceed very well in expunging metaphysical interests from his mind, any more thanskepticism in the history of philosophy has ever managed to expel metaphysicalreflection from the human mind, no matter how often it tries. “Lamarck, Plato,Hume, and God jostled for attention,” says Janet Browne of Darwin’s reading afterhe got back to England after his five-year voyage on theBeagle. “He had no end oftheories about humanity occupying his brain: theories about the origin of language,about morality, religion, and race” (Browne,1995, pp. 364–439).In a way, it is too bad that in his desultory reading of metaphysics he neversufficiently attended to the idealist tradition, which could have illumined how theenvironment testifies to the meaning of the emergence of humans as a species. If hehad thought through some of the metaphysical implications of his theory, he mightnot have been so diffident about the human mind’s ability to reach metaphysicalconclusions. For evolution does not just say something about life, about humans,about struggle, and about the lowly origins of mind from mud. It also says somethingabout the environment,including the metaphysical environment!Tothe best of my knowledge, Lawrence Henderson (1878–1942), the Americanbiochemist at Harvard, was the first to shift the terms of the debate among evolution-ary biologists from specific biological forms to the testimony natural selection givesregarding the nature of the environment doing the selecting (Henderson,1913). Inwhat follows, I wish to stress that I am presenting here my own version of Hen-derson’s shift of perspective. Clearly he was right that, in Darwinian terms (not tomention Aristotelian terms), life cannot emerge unless the environment is first fitfor life.20But I shall take his argument one step further and claim that we also livein ametaphysicalenvironment without which rational life would not be possible.20Notice how his argument is perfectly willing to go in both directions, from investigating what in the environmentmakes life possibleandfrom investigating the properties of life to determine what the environment must thereforebe like (or have been like): “Meanwhile it should be noted that there are two different ways of illustrating thefitness of a physical property. Properly employed, both are free from fallacy, and it will be desirable for us toemploy both” (Henderson,1913,p.70)."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"64Edward T. OakesMy way of putting this argument is as follows. Because Darwinism gave a newexplanation for how and why each organism is so well adapted to its environment,the record of convergence (similar organs, such as eyes and wings, developingindependently across many phyla and species) surely must say something as wellabout the environment. In other words, the fact that so many biological formsdeveloped photosensitive cells and then eyes (or their equivalents) also testifies tothe ubiquity of light, just as the fact that wings developed independently on insects,birds, bats, some dinosaurs, and so forth, testifies to the density and viscosity of theatmosphere of the earth. So too with complex brains: to be adaptive,brains have toevolve in response to the environment.OrasIhaveargued elsewhere (Oakes,2004,pp. 28–30), if wings evolve against and in response to air, and eyes against andin response to light, then brains must evolve against and in response to somethinglike “mental air.” By that admittedly metaphorical term, I mean thosea prioriideal structures already part of the universe that make a mathematics-capable brainpossible in the first place. In other words, Darwinism not only is compatible withPlatonism, but presupposes it.This perhaps startling point of view is admirably explained and defended byDaniel Dennett in his lucid philosophical meditation on Darwinian theory,Darwin’sDangerous Idea, where he neatly explains the necessity for Platonic thinking byusing this intriguing thought experiment:Suppose SETI [the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence] struck it rich, and establishedcommunication with intelligent beings on another planet. We would not be surprised to findthat they understood and used the same arithmetic that we do. Why not? Because arithmeticisright...The point is clearly not restricted to arithmetic, but to all “necessary truths” – whatphilosophers since Plato have calleda prioriknowledge . . . It has often been pointed out thatPlato’s curious theory of reincarnation and reminiscence, which he offers as an explanationof the source of oura prioriknowledge, bears a striking resemblance to Darwin’s theory,and this resemblance is particularly striking from our current vantage point. Darwin himselffamously noted the resemblance in a remark in one of his notebooks. Commenting on theclaim that Plato thought our “necessary ideas” arise from the pre-existence of the soul,Darwin wrote: “read monkeys for pre-existence.”(Dennett,1995, pp. 129–30)But this particular thought experiment does not pertain directly to evolutionary the-ory, even if it does neatly dispatch certain postmodern theories that claim that rulesof arithmetic and the law of gravity vary according to the culture that acknowl-edges them. Another thought experiment, however, illuminates more directly therole certain ideala prioristructures play in the evolution of humans:Any functioning structure carries implicit information about the environment in which itsfunction “works.” The wings of a seagull magnificently embody principles of aerodynamicdesign, and thereby also imply that the creature whose wings they are is excellently adaptedfor flight in a medium having the specific density and viscosity of the atmosphere within"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"4 Complexity in context65a thousand meters or so of the surface of the Earth...Suppose we carefully preservedthe body of a seagull and set it off into space (without any accompanying explanation), tobe discovered by Martians. If they made the fundamental assumption that the wings werefunctional, and that their function was flight (which might not be as obvious to them as we,who have seen them do it, think), they could use this assumption to “read off” the implicitinformation about an environment for which these wings would be well designed. Supposethey then asked themselves how all this aerodynamic theory came to be implicit in thestructure, or, in other words: How did all this information get into these wings? The answermustbe: By an interaction between the environment and the seagull’s ancestors.(Dennett,1995, pp. 197–8)All well and good, but what happens when we continue this logic and do somereverse engineering on the human brain? If wings testify to the density and vis-cosity of the earth’s atmosphere, and if the eye (or its equivalent) testifies to theubiquity of light, to what then does the brain testify? We have already seen thatthe SETI project presupposes the presence across intergalactic planetary systemsof thea prioristructures of intelligence, mathematics above all: we will be able torecognize the presence of intelligence on other planets only by seeing that otherlife forms recognize the same ideal truths that we do. And that is the clue we need:just as we will be able to spot intelligent life on other planets only by the commoncommunication of intelligible truths across vast distances, so too we now realize,with Dennett’s reverse-engineering thought experiment, that such mutual recogni-tion ofa prioriintelligible truth will have been made possible only because theinformation of mathematics, logic, and so forth, has “selected for” intelligence intwo different locations in the universe. In other words, brains evolve over, against,and in response to “mental air,” just as eyes evolve over, against, and in responseto light, and wings over, against, and in response to atmosphere, physical air. Or toput the matter perhaps less metaphorically, no intelligence without intelligibility, ormore exactly, no evolved intelligence without a prior environmental intelligibility.21I admit that the logic of this argument leads to the dread specter of Idealism (whichposits that ideal realities such as number, logic, and forms precede and determinematerial realities); and Idealism in particular tends to spook out scientists even21John Haught, who contributes a chapter to the current volume, makes this argument of the “fitness of theenvironment for intelligence” the key moment in his challenge to Darwinian atheists, whom he addresses inthe second person in a kind ofj’accuse:Your mental activity...isnotsomething that takes place outside of the natural world. But if your intellectionis part of nature, then this tells you something important about the nature of the universe itself....Think,then, about what kind of universe it must be that gives rise in its evolution to an intelligence that cannot helptrusting that truth is worth seeking. Does your native trust in this world’s intelligibility – and in your own mind’scapacity to grasp this intelligibility – “fit” well into the ultimately absurd and mindless universe articulated byyour evolutionary materialism? Or instead does it not fit much more satisfactorily a universe that, in its depths,bears an endless intelligibility, a universe that invites you to search deeper and deeper for truth, and that beckonsyou with a promise that such a pursuit is worthwhile?(Haught,2003,p.100)"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"66Edward T. Oakesmore than metaphysics does in general.22In fact, I rather suspect that the reasonscientists find metaphysics so disquieting is precisely because it keeps leading toidealist conclusions. But if I am right that science finds itself regularly bumpinginto metaphysics, and if evolution means that the information of the environmentis always being “read into” the organism so that one can “read back” what theenvironment must have been like,based solely on the information in the organism,then I see no alternative but to hold that reality is first ideal before it is material.As is well known by now, some cosmologists go further and insist, by usingan argument known as the Strong Cosmological Anthropic Argument, that mat-erial reality such as atoms (or, more specifically, subatomic particles and thereforea fortioriatoms) cannot exist unless there are knowers to know them. (This paper,which concentrates on biological complexity, has not dealt with that issue and willnot so do in its conclusion.23)However, it does seem appropriate to conclude thesereflections with a final consideration of what the universe would be like withoutknowers. At first glance, it would seem that evolutionary theory presupposes thepossibility – indeed actuality – of a world without knowers, since the evolution ofconsciousness came last of all. A more logical objection would ask whether it iseven meaningful to speak of a knower-less universe, since the question of such apossibility can arise only in minds already “thrown into” the universe. Yet, leavingthis logical conundrum aside, the enigma of consciousness is still a fundamentaldatum of the world, and the human mind cannot help but ask what that means, whatit says about the nature of the universe.2422Philosophers, too, are not immune to Idealism-phobia. For example, Thomas Nagel confesses his atheism thisway: “The thought that the relation between mind and the world is something fundamental makes many peoplein this day and age nervous . . . I want atheism to be true and am made uneasy by the fact that some of the mostintelligent and well-informed people I know are religious believers” (Nagel,1997,p.130). Still, one salutesNagel’s honesty in refusing to let his nerves get the better of his philosophical acumen, which acumen leadshim to see the Idealist implications of Darwinian theory: “Whatever justification reason provides must comefrom the reasons it discovers, themselves. They cannot get their authority from natural selection. . . . This meansthat the evolutionary hypothesis is acceptable only if reason does not need its support” (id., pp. 136, 139).23None the less, since this chapter began by showing how physics has lately also been serving as the midwife ofmetaphysics, a nod in the direction of quantum physics would not be out of place:A leading quantum theorist, Eugene Wigner . . . suggests that it is the entry of the information about the quantumsystem into the mind of the observer that collapses the quantum wave and abruptly converts a schizophrenic,hybrid, ghost state into a sharp and definite state of concrete reality. Thus, when the experimenter himself looksat the apparatus pointer, he causes it to decide upon either one position or the other, and thereby, down thechain, also forces the electron to make up its mind. If Wigner’s thesis is accepted it returns us to the old ideaof dualism – that mind exists as a separate entity on the same level as matter and can act on matter causingit to move in apparent violation of the laws of physics. . . . Whatever the validity of Wigner’s ideas, they dosuggest that the solution of the mind–body problem may be closely connected with the solution of the quantummeasurement problem, whatever that will eventually be.(Davies,1983,p.115)24Notice again the transition from physics to metaphysics when the question becomes one of consciousness:The present author, having no competence whatsoever to assess the soundness of the theories (however meta-physical their content) that scientists develop on the basis of their specialized knowledge, cannot say whether ornot some differential equations and numerical relationships are embedded in the universe rather than imposedon it, and supposes thatthe question is, strictly speaking, outside the realm of physics as it defines itself. Let"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"4 Complexity in context67“There is the best of precedents for concluding a long and abstract discussion ofdifficult philosophical matters with a myth,” says Arthur Lovejoy at the conclusionof hisRevolt against Dualism, his history of the philosophical attempts to rid theworld of Cartesian dualism by naturalizing the mind in the manner that Darwinattempted at the end of his life. After demonstrating in great detail and with mar-velous verve that all attempts to regard the mind as entirely a component of naturalprocesses have failed, he ends his book by trying to imagine how Plato might haverecast his myth of creation in theTimaeusif he had been writing today, that is, “if hehad been enough of an evolutionist to conceive of the production of living creaturesas proceeding from lower to higher, and if he had been more definitely mindful ofthe problem of the character and genesis of natural knowledge” (Lovejoy,1955,p. 399). In other words, what would the Demiurge have fashioned if he had been aDarwinist working via the process of natural selection?In this delightful revision of Platonic myth, Lovejoy shows that the Demiurge, ifhe wanted to let consciousness emerge out of Darwinian processes, would still haveto have created space and time, for they remain essential constituents of evolutionarytheory no less than of Platonism. He then imagines what the Demiurge would havesaid after he had fashioned time as the mobile image of eternity and space as thehome for all things in the world: with space and time alone, there would still besomething missing in the universe. “The creatures,” so Lovejoy’s Demiurge wouldsay, “confined within the narrow bounds of their separate being, are wholly strangersto one another, . . . and the things they suffer and the deeds they do endure but for aninstant and are then lost in the non-being of the Past.” A sad outcome for so noblean effort, no? But because time decrees the evanescence of all things temporal,which not even the Demiurge can countermand, and because space decrees that allextended things be external to each other, nothing can be present in its own timeand place and yet located elsewhere at the same time. What is allotted to one cannever belong to another. At which point the Demiurge hits upon a solution:Let me, then, consider how I may remove this imperfection, as far as the nature of thingsallows . . . What is needful is that the nature which belongs to one region of being shall benot only reproduced in another, not merely, when so reproduced, be beheld by a creatureus be satisfied with saying that knowing, the very act of conceptually grasping a truth, and the very fact thatour mind communes with a world that it is not, and can assimilate that world, or make it into a self-consciousevent – that this most common fact is, when we think of it, the strangest thing one could imagine. If God isincomprehensible, the fact of our perceiving and knowing is no less so – at least on the common (Cartesian)assumption that I am an observer of the universe, and that this universe is radically, irreducibly alien. Thepossibility of “mine-ness” may be a miracle in itself, but the fact that I can make a foreign body mine, takesomething not previously present in me and convert it into an act of awareness, is surely a miracle of miracles.When we think of it we feel tempted to embrace the Platonic-Augustinian theory of anamnesis and say thatwhat we know is what has always been in us. And this is indeed one way of approaching the Whole-in-each-parttheory: it is only because the Whole is in us that we can know anything at all.(Kolakowski,2001, pp. 77–8 [emphasis added])"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"68Edward T.

So considering, the Demiurgus proceededto add the gift of knowledge to the many other less excellent gifts which he had alreadydistributed amongst the various grades of living things; and he created the animal man toreceive and have the custody of this gift.(Lovejoy,1955, pp. 400–1 [emphasis added])But what is our gift is also our dilemma, as Blaise Pascal knew so well and explainedso unsparingly: “Thinking reed.Itisnot in space and time that I must look for mydignity, but in the organization of my thoughts. I shall have no advantage in owningestates. Through space the universe grasps and engulfs me like a pinpoint; butthrough thought I can grasp it” (Pascal,1995, no. 145, p. 36). So E. M. Cioranis right, and one of the epigraphs to this chapter also brings us round to the sameconclusion as his aphorism: “Aconsciousfruit fly would have to confront exactlythe same difficulties, the same kind of insoluble problems, as man...Todefyheredity is to defy billions of years, to defy the first cell” (Cioran,1973, pp. 5, 31).And maybe that fruit fly would come to see what Friedrich Nietzsche meant when hesaid inThe Gay Science: “Even we knowers today, we godless anti-metaphysicians,still take our fire, too, from the flame lit by a faith thousands of years old – thatChristian faith which was also the faith of Plato, that God is the truth, and truth isdivine” (Nietzsche,1974, no. 344).ReferencesAristotle (1984).Metaphysics.InThe Collected Works of Aristotle,vol. 2, transl.

As a prelude to this investigation, itseems worthwhile to explore the theme of fine-tuning itself in some detail, giventhe ambiguities that still surround it and the vigor of the continuing disagreementas to what its implications are. How did fine-tuning make its way into the cosmo-logical discussion? What precisely did – and does – it amount to? What were – andstill are – the responses to it? How is one to evaluate those responses? Achievingameasure of clarity on these issues should make it easier to appreciate the searchfor fine-tuning or its analogs elsewhere in the sciences.The infinities of space and time in Newtonian mechanics were not propitiousto the formulation of a cosmology, a theory of the cosmic whole, although thenotion of gravity gave a hint, at least, as to how material complexity could form.The unification of space and time by Einstein’s general theory in a non-Euclideangeometrical framework offered new possibilities, and Hubble’s subsequent con-firmation of galactic expansion pointed Lemaˆıtre to a universe model that would,from a “primeval atom,” expand into the universe we know. Now, for the first timein the modern era, the universe could conceivably be presented as having a defi-nite age, a definite time-related size, and a tentative list of contents. In short, theconstruction of a theory of the whole – a cosmology – became possible. After aperiod of indecision in regard to the new and controversial expansion model of theuniverse, while the rival steady-state model still challenged the notion of an initialcosmic state, the discovery in 1964 of the isotropic microwave radiation that hadearlier been thought to be a likely consequence of the expanding-universe theoryhelped to gain widespread acceptance for the new cosmological model.Fitness of the Cosmos for Life: Biochemistry and Fine-Tuning,ed.

Hehad been struck by a coincidence between three such numbers, each an integralpower of a very large number,N,ofthe order of 1040: (1) the ratio of the gravitationalto the electric force is∼N−1; (2) the ratio of the mass of the universe to the massof the proton is∼N2; and (3) the Hubble age of the universe in atomic units is∼N.Dirac was convinced that the occurrence ofNin these apparently unrelated cos-mic features could not possibly be a coincidence. However, one of the three, theHubble age, is a variable. Assuming the coincidence to be significant, the other twowould therefore also have to be variables in order to maintain equality. The conse-quences would be that the numbers of protons and neutrons would have to increaseover time, and the gravitational “constant” would have to decrease, both troublingimplications for theory. Dirac focused on the latter of the two consequences, propos-ing that the gravitational factor should weaken over time. (Although he did not notethis, such a revision would have the benefit of explaining the enormous value ofN,the feature that had puzzled Dirac most. It would simply reflect the great age of theuniverse at this point.1)Robert Dicke (1961) later hit on an interesting rejoinder. As noted, Dirac hadtaken it to be more than mere coincidence that the Hubble age should happen to havethe value∼N, thus linking it to the other two cosmic features. Dicke showed that thiswas indeed not a coincidence, but his explanation was quite different from Dirac’s.Observers can exist in the universe only after heavy elements have had time to form,and within the maximum lifetime of a massive star.2Calculations show that, giventhe components from which the other two constants are constructed, the Hubbleage during the “epoch of man,” as Dicke called it, wouldnecessarilybe of the orderofN. The relationship betweenHand the other two does not therefore indicate aninvariant relationship, as Dirac thought, but is a selection effect, a constraint set onthe value ofTby the conditions of human observership.3There is no reason, then,to make the gravitational constant or the mass of the universe vary.1For technical detail on the matters discussed in this section and the next, by far the best source is Barrow andTipler,1986.2More correctly, it would be before all massive stars would have burned out, a much longer time, but one still inthe very rough “of the order of” that he is relying on.3The familiar example of a selection effect is that if in a large catch of fish none is smaller than a certain size,this might seem surprising until it is noted that it merely reflects the dimension of the mesh of the net in whichthe fish were caught. For an exhaustive recent discussion of selection effects, including the effect claimed bymany-universe proponents, see Bostrom,2002."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"72Ernan McMullinThis episode illustrates particularly well the relations between four notions thatare of central concern to our story. Dicke’s is ananthropicexplanation becauseit calls on human presence as an explanatory factor. (Eddington’s is even moredirectly anthropic; indeed, it may be the most audaciously anthropic explanation inthe modern history of cosmology!) Dicke’s explanation also points to aselectioneffectthat involves tuning only in the rather strained sense that the value ofHhasto lie within certain limits for the “coincidence” to appear. But the tuning is in nosense “fine”: the “of the order of” in Dicke’s calculations could haveHlying at anymoment over billions of years! Nor does he suggest thatdesignmight be involved;what attracted Dirac’s attention was simply a numerical coincidence, no more. Sohis speculation and Dicke’s response attracted little attention outside of cosmology.But to some cosmologists, Dirac and Dicke suggested an ingenious way to treatapparent cosmic coincidence.The impetus for this suggestion came from two different sources. After thediscovery in 1967 that the cosmic microwave background was isotropic to at leastthe 0.1 percent level, many were asking: What sorts of initial conditions could havemade this possible after billions of years had passed? Brandon Carter and othersposed a different query: What if the fundamental dimensionless constants of nature,like the ratios between the strengths of the four fundamental forces or the valueof the fine-structure constant, were to be slightly different? What difference wouldit make to the prospects of life? It was the direction ultimately taken in responseto the former of these questions that drew the attention of the wider public to thephenomenon that would later be dubbed “fine-tuning.”However, the immediate preference for a response to this question was for achaotic cosmic starting point. Here one might detect the influence of what may becalled a “Principle of Indifference” that tends to prevail among cosmologists: thedirective to avoid, if at all possible, setting a specific constraint on the initial cosmicboundary conditions. (The Principle of Indifference and fine-tuning are, of course,antithetical to each other.) Setting a constraint, whether fine or not, forces one toask the awkward question: But why these boundary conditions rather than others?4In any event, a “chaotic cosmology,” as its protagonist, Charles Misner, dubbed it,proved to be unable to yield anything close to the required present level of isotropy.Barry Collins and Stephen Hawking (1973) came to the conclusion that a quiteextraordinary degree of constraint would have to be imposed on the initial cosmicenergy density for the present cosmic state to develop. For that state to be as closeto “flatness” as the present state is, the initial state would have to be flat to an almostunimaginable precision. That is, it would have to have an energy density almost4Or, as Barrow and Tipler put it: “The appeal of this type of explanation [chaotic cosmology] is obvious: it makesknowledge of the (unknowable!) initial conditions at the ‘origin’ of the Universe largely superfluous to ourpresent understanding of its large-scale character” (1986,p.422; see also McMullin,1993)."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"5Tuning fine-tuning73exactly poised between values that would lead either to an indefinitely expanding(“open”) universe or to a collapsing (“closed”) one, the so-called critical density.5Hence the term “fine-tuning,” which soon came into common use to describe thissort of restriction.This choice of label has been vigorously contested by some: fine-tuning carrieswith it the suggestion of a Tuner, they charge (see, for example, Grunbaum,1998).Since the label has become more or less accepted in this context, however, it seemsbest to retain it at this stage while underlining the neutral descriptive sense inwhich it is being used. The term “fine-tuning” will be taken to refer simply to anysurprisingly tight restriction that has to be set on a cosmic feature, in this casethe initial cosmic state, if the sort of universe we now have is later to develop.Restriction of a parameter alone is not enough to constitute tuning; the restrictionmust be required if some other feature of interest is to come about.Collins and Hawking could not believe that so specific a constraint could simplybe a coincidence. But how is this fine-tuning to be explained, to be made lesssurprising? Recalling the anthropic strategy then in the air, they proposed an infiniteensemble of actually existing universes, of which ours is one, an ensemble thatexhibits the widest range of values of the critical parameter. In such an ensemble,it would not be surprising that one exists as close as necessary to the critical valueof the energy density, the value that would allow that universe to remain flat at amuch later time. And this is the kind of one in which we must necessarily findourselves: the formation of inhomogeneities such as galaxies, over the course oftime, appears to require cosmic flatness, which is thus a necessary condition forlife (and thus observers like us) to develop. Their many-universe hypothesis thusrenders the fact thatouruniverse is fine-tuned in regard to initial energy density nolonger surprising. It cannotbutbe fine-tuned, i.e. display an at first sight surprisinglysevere restriction on its initial conditions!6An anthropic argument of this sort involves in effect four steps. First is to postulatea large (infinite?) ensemble of existent universes exhibiting a range of the desiredcharacteristic. Second is to establish, somehow, a probability measure over theensemble as a means of ensuring that at least one member will have the needed5The ratio between the actual energy density at any given moment in the cosmic expansion and the critical densityat that moment is designated by the Greek letter\u0001. This is a pure number and must be close to unity for theuniverse to be “flat”; i.e. the actual density at any moment must be close to the critical density at that moment.The energy density itself is, of course, constantly decreasing as the universe expands.6Collins and Hawking suggested that their hypothesis carried with it a further bonus. The title of their articleasks: “Why is the universe isotropic?” With the help of a number of simplifying assumptions, they argue thatcosmic flatness ensures present isotropy. Since their many-universe hypothesis renders it no longer surprisingthat the initial state of the universe in which we find ourselves should be fine-tuned, it would also explain why itshould be isotropic. (“Why is the universe isotropic? Because we are here.”) Thus, in effect, the known isotropyof the microwave radiation would serve as further evidence for the many-universe hypothesis. Unfortunately, theassumptions that underlie the claim that flatness is a sufficient condition for isotropy do not hold up. (See Barrowand Tipler,1986, pp. 422–30.) This, of course, still leaves intact their main argument (that the many-universehypothesis accounts for the fine-tuning), which is somewhat confusingly mingled with the isotropy issue."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"74Ernan McMullinvalue of that characteristic. (This is, perhaps, the weakest link in the argument.)Third is to show that this cosmic characteristic (e.g. flatness) is necessary if auniverse is to be life-bearing. Fourth is to point out that our universe, the universethat occasioned the fine-tuning puzzle, will necessarily be the one (or one of theones) in the ensemble possessing the required characteristic.This has the effect of moving the Principle of Indifference up one level to anensemble of universes, within which none is to be regarded as special in itself. Thatone of thoseappearsto be special would then simply be a selection effect imposedby the conditions under which the question is asked rather than by the nature ofwhat is studied. Advertence to the selection effect transforms the situation: the fine-tuning required to arrive at the present state of our universe, which initially seemedsurprising, now turns out to be intelligible. And in that sense it is “explained,” or(if one prefers) is explained away, the ontological price being, of course, very high.For some time before this Brandon Carter had been discussing the potential role ofselection effects in cosmology. In 1974, he published a paper (Carter,1974)inwhichhe proposed the idea of an “anthropic principle,” and the term soon took on a life ofits own. The principle could take either a “weak” or a “strong” form. The weak form,the one relevant to the Collins–Hawking strategy, is in effect a truism, but one thatcan serve as a useful reminder: what is observed is restricted by whatever conditionsare necessary to allow the existence of observers.7As the term “anthropic principle”is now used by cosmologists, it normally refers to the device of appealing to a largeensemble of existent universes as a means of transforming a troubling instanceof fine-tuning into a non-troubling selection effect. More useful for the purposesof this discussion is the notion of anthropicexplanation,anexplanation involvinghuman agency or human presence. It is already applicable in such natural sciencesas physical anthropology and meteorology (in explaining climate warming, forexample). The appeal to a many-universe solution is evidently a form of anthropicexplanation.But Carter’s proposal also had a different, more controversial field of application:what if the dimensionless constants that define our world were to be different?Here, it turned out, a surprise was once again in store. In many instances, evena small percentage change in the value of a single physical constant, holding theother constants unchanged, would yield a universe that is not hospitable to life. Itbecame, indeed, a sort of parlor game among physicists to work out consequencesof this sort. Some of their conclusions: If the electromagnetic force were to be evenslightly stronger relative to the other fundamental forces, all stars would be reddwarfs, and planets would not form. Or if it were a little weaker, all stars would7The “strong” form contains an ambiguous “must” and either reduces to the weak form or is too strong: “Theuniversemustbe such as to allow the eventual appearance within it of observers” (see McMullin,1993,pp. 376–7)."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"5Tuning fine-tuning75be very hot, and thus short-lived. Other thought experiments bore on the chemicalconstitution of the imagined universe: If the strong nuclear force were to be just alittle stronger, all of the hydrogen in the early universe would have been convertedinto helium. If it were to be slightly weaker in percentage terms, helium wouldnot have formed, leaving an all-hydrogen universe. If the weak nuclear force wereto have been just a little weaker, supernovas would not have developed, and thusheavier elements would not have been created. And so on.8In each of these cases, the consequence of the change in the constant’s valuewould be relevant to the possibility of a biotic (life-hospitable) universe. Thechanges hypothesized above, just a few among the many similar ones proposed,would lead to a universe in which life could not have developed. Of course, somelarge assumptions are built into this sort of counterfactual reasoning, notably thatwe know at least some of the necessary conditions for life and, even more funda-mentally, that single constants can be meaningfully varied in this abstract way. Bothassumptions have given rise to much debate, but we shall simply acknowledge theexistence of this debate here and pass on.Fine-tuning of this sort might be called “nomic,” since it is the laws of naturethat are at issue. Its status is clearly very different from that of fine-tuning of suchboundary conditions as initial energy density. What caused surprise in the lattercase was extreme fine-tuning of a parameter that would have been expected to befree-ranging. The fine-tuning is there prior to any consideration of a tie to bioticconditions, whereas in the nomic case the surprise arises only when the bioticrelevance of the relative values of the physical constants is noted. The significanceof the fine-tuning depends here on biotic considerations. It seems plausible onthe face of it that the initial cosmic conditions might have been different; a widecontinuum of possible values of the energy density, for example, would not beinconsistent with theory. In the nomic case, however, we have no assurance thatthe constants of nature in our observable universe can be meaningfully regarded asvariables on some larger scale. Treating them in this way is, in effect, to extend thePrinciple of Indifference to the nomic level.There is another way to deal with cosmic fine-tuning, one that is highly con-tentious in the scientific context. It too makes essential reference to the (weak)Anthropic Principle. From the perspective of the Western theological tradition, allthree of the major Abrahamic faiths agree in viewing God as the Creator of all thatis, although they might spell out the notion of creation in somewhat different ways.They would also agree in holding that the Creator has a special care for humankind,8Foracatalog of possible instances of nomic fine-tuning, see, for example, Leslie (1996, pp. 33–56). That weshould find ourselves in a three-dimensional universe might already be described as “tuning” of the most generalsort: “The alternatives are too simple, too unstable or too unpredictable for complex observers to evolve andpersist within them. As a result we should not be surprised to find ourselves living in three spacious dimensionssubject to the ravages of a single time. There is no alternative” (Barrow,2002, pp. 225–6)."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"76Ernan McMullina care that has been demonstrated over and over according to the Western faith-traditions. With these two beliefs as premises, one can immediately infer that theCreator would fine-tune the original work of creation in whatever way would benecessary to ensure the coming-to-be of the human race.9This inference requiresno additional premises beyond two that are already central to those different reli-gious traditions. And it immediately explains (i.e. eliminates the element of surprisefrom) the fine-tuning that set off the original inquiry.For those who share these beliefs, there just isn’t any surprise in the fine-tuningstory. They would say: Well,of course! This explanation is also an anthropic one, butin a quite different way from the many-universe explanation. It is anthropic becauseit attributes an anthropic motive to the Creator in the original act of creation. TheCreator is assumed to have got it right from the beginning, without need for latermiraculous intervention.This last point distinguishes the anthropic way of dealing with cosmic fine-tuningfrom that of the recent proponents of “Intelligent Design” (ID) in the context ofbiological evolution. In the evolutionary context a “special” action on the part ofthe Creator is claimed to have been required at crucial moments in the developmentof terrestrial life: at its origin, at least, and perhaps also at various stages in thedevelopment of various “irreducible complexities” in the living body.10The IDapproach competes with possible scientific explanations of these developments,often arguing not only that such explanations are currently not known, but alsothat they are in principle excluded. The theistic explanation of fine-tuning is ofa quite different sort. It involves no challenge to science, no postulation of a gapin possible scientific explanation. The fine-tuning is simply a specification of theoriginal creation and involves no “special” action on God’s part. Nor is itad hoc:itfollows directly from the original theological premises, once fine-tuning presentsitself as a problem in cosmology.Further fine-tuning developments in cosmology and physicsThree further developments in cosmology and physics bore directly on the fine-tuning theme. In 1981, Alan Guth proposed a modification of the Big Bang theory,9Foranearly assessment of this argument, see McMullin,1981, pp. 47–52.10Michael Behe argues for the presence in the living cell of various “irreducible complexities” that wouldrequire the agency of intelligence to bring them about, but leaves open “the simplest possible design scenario,”which would posit “a single cell – formed billions of years ago – that already contained all information toproduce descendent organisms” (1996,p.231). He supposes that “irreducibly complex” systems that manifestedthemselves long afterward, such as that which produces blood-clotting, might have had their designs alreadypresent in potency in that first cell but not yet “turned on” (id., p. 228). The force of this suggestion dependson what “turning on” amounts to. The original ID argument would require it to involve a “special” action onthe Designer’s part, which would seriously dilute the notion of potency Behe is employing here. If such actionis not required, the complexities hardly qualify as “irreducible.”"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"5Tuning fine-tuning77one that would, he hoped, have the effect of eliminating some troublesome anoma-lies. He postulated an enormous inflation of the infant universe during the firstfraction of a second of its existence, one that lasted no longer than perhaps 10−35seconds but that, in a brief moment, multiplied the diameter of the universe by amind-boggling factor of perhaps 1050(Guth,1981). Over the next few years, theidea underwent rapid further development, the anomalies yielding in impressivemanner one by one.11One of these was what Guth called the “flatness problem,”the tight constraint on the initial energy density that had given rise to the fine-tuningissue in the first place. It was shown that the inflationary expansion would be sogreat that it would force the density of the infant universe to the critical value, nomatter what the initial density might have been. The need for fine-tuning of thedensity parameter would in this way be eliminated, or at least reduced, and thePrinciple of Indifference would once more reign for the preinflation state, whichcould have any of the possible values of the energy density.Besides handling anomalies, inflation had two other major features in its favor. Itcould explain the isotropy of the cosmic microwave radiation, for which Collins andHawking had attempted to develop an anthropic explanation. More significantly,as later developments would show, it could make use of quantum theory to providean answer to a long-standing puzzle: where were the inhomogeneities needed forgalactic formation to come from if the background radiation was isotropic? Inflationwould have the effect of magnifying quantum fluctuations to such an extent thatthey could furnish the necessary galactic seeds. Of course, that would depend onfinding that the radiation was not in fact perfectly isotropic, as it had originallyseemed to be.Sure enough, very tiny departures from isotropy have been found by meansof extraordinarily precise satellite observations. Furthermore, the pattern of thesedepartures across the width of the sky is claimed to offer strong support to the infla-tion hypothesis (Spergelet al., 2003; Schwartz and Terrero-Escalante,2004). Othersupport has come, for example, from the distribution of diffuse intergalactic gas inthe very early universe. It has to be said, however, that as yet no adequate theory hasbeen formulated that can explainwhythe inflation occurred. The hypothesis doesnot yet have as strong a mandate, therefore, as does the Big Bang theory to which itis an addendum. But as matters stand, it would be fair to say that the warrant for theoriginal claim of fine-tuning for the initial cosmic conditions has been substantiallyweakened. The universe may have had a “chaotic” starting point after all – that is,11The horizon problem had to do with the horizon distance over which causal signals can propagate. The magneticmonopole problem pointed to the apparent absence in our cosmic neighborhood of the very heavy particlesthat theory seemed to require. Inflation solved each of them in the same way: by almost instantly creatingimmense distances between causal regions and between monopoles. The region destined to become our observ-able universe might at that early time have been no more than 10 cm across (see Barrow and Tipler,1986,pp. 432–4)."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"78Ernan McMullinone that needed no particular specification of boundary conditions so that the kindof universe we have might later develop.The recently discovered acceleration of the cosmic expansion has led to thereintroduction of the “cosmological constant” that Einstein long ago postulatedin order to keep the gravitating universe from collapsing. It was abandoned asunnecessary after the recession of the galaxies led to the postulation of cosmicexpansion and, ultimately, of the Big Bang. Now it is coming back into favor againbutonquite different grounds. However, its quite extraordinarily tiny value incomparison with the other fundamental constants (about 120 orders of magnitudesmaller) is a surprise. Why so off-the-scale a value? One possible answer: a tinyvalue of the constant could be required if the universe were not to undergo immediaterunaway expansion and thus be unable to support the development of stars andgalaxies, and hence of complex life. Once again, an anthropic explanation suggestsitself: why not an immense ensemble of other existing universes with differentvalues of the cosmological constant, including at least one with the requisite value?(See, for example, Linde,1990a, pp. 158–60; Weinberg,2000.)Afurther development that bears on the fine-tuning theme is the proliferationof many-universe formulations in the wake of the initial successes of the infla-tion hypothesis. Andrei Linde formulated a modified version of the inflation idea,dubbing it “chaotic inflation” (1990a,p.13). Encouraged by developments in uni-fied theories of particle physics, and especially by the introduction there of scalar(instead of the usual vector) fields, he proposed a “chaotic” distribution of initialscalar fields (inflatons) as the cosmic expansion began. Inflation leads each of thesefields to create its own “domain”; the domains are separated from one another bydomain “walls.” Since the fields vary from one domain to the next, the fundamentalforces in each may “break out” differently, and hence the laws of physics in eachmight also vary. Each domain would become its own “universe,” as it were, withoutcausal contact with the other “universes” other than at the moment of originationin the single inflation event.Pushing this speculation a step further, Linde, Vilenkin, and others postulate a“multiverse” that is infinite both in space and in time, one in which inflation eventsoccur frequently, the one that produced our universe being just another of these (seeLinde,1990b;Vilenkin,1995).12By supposing the multiverse to be eternal, theyhoped to bypass the problem of how it is to be generated in the first place. It is, ineffect, a given, embodying the Principle of Indifference at the ultimate level. Sincethe individual “bubble universes” are at no time in causal contact with one another,12Vilenkin’s proposal is that “small closed universes spontaneously nucleate out of nothing, where ‘nothing’refers to the absence of not only matter, but also of space and time” (1995,p.846). He goes on to assert: “Weare one of an infinite number of civilizations living in thermalized regions of the metauniverse” (1995, p. 847).This illustrates rather well what may happen when one allows an infinite number of entities or of events to berealized!"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"5Tuning fine-tuning79it is no longer a “uni-verse” with the accompanying suggestion of a causal unity ofsome sort.13Hence the term “multiverse,” which is rapidly gaining acceptance.Fine-tuning in chemistryUntil now our discussion has focused on cosmology and physics. Might claims offine-tuning also originate in chemistry? Restricting the inquiry to the basic materialsneeded for life to develop, do they yield the sorts of necessary conditions that fine-tuning relies on? The presence of carbon compounds as building blocks and ofwater as a solvent are the two most often-cited candidates. Both have, in fact, beenchallenged as supposedly necessary conditions for any form of life (silicon insteadof carbon? solvents other than water?). Nevertheless, both remain favored as beingessential to the complex chemistry of life.As far back as 1953, Hoyle pointed to a striking “what if?” involving carbon(Hoyle,1954). For carbon to form within stars from the fusion of beryllium andhelium and for it not to convert too rapidly into oxygen, he predicted that the relevantnuclear resonance level would have to lie within a very narrow range of values(Dunbaret al., 1953a,b; Barrow and Tipler,1986, pp. 252–4). Later experimentalwork confirmed this prediction, although there has been some debate recently abouthow “fine” that tuning actually is. Just as important is that the carbon not converttoo rapidly into oxygen; here the resonance level in oxygen that would have led torapid conversion is barely avoided. Were the values to be slightly different in eitherof the two cases, there would not be enough carbon to sustain the chemistry of life(Hoyle,1965).So, carbon fine-tuning shows itself in chemistry. But what makes it interestinghere is the further presumed tie between the presence of carbon and the capacityfor organic life. Fine-tuning links this capacity for organic life to tightly specifiedresonance levels in the nucleus. But these levels depend in turn on the basic physicsof the nucleus, and ultimately on the fundamental physical constants, as in the othernomic examples given above. In other words, the fine-tuning inference begins inbiochemistry, but ends in physics. It seems, in principle, possible for an apparentinstance of fine-tuning in biochemistry to turn out to beonlyapparent once theunderlying physics is worked out. A wide range of the relevant parameters at thelevel of physics might converge to give the appearance of fine-tuning at the levelof chemistry.13Terminology in this context is still somewhat fluid. The term “multiverse” is also often used where a singleoriginating event brings about an ensemble of domains that do share a causal relation with one another at themoment of origin, although not later. I continue to use the more familiar “many-universe” label for this latterconstruction, while recognizing that this is a somewhat problematic usage. I restrict the term “multiverse” tothe infinite domain with its infinite series of inflation events."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"80Ernan McMullinBut this is likely to be the exception. At any rate, in the case of carbon, recentcalculations seem to indicate that the fine-tuning first apparent in the chemistryof the various nuclei involved carries over to the level of basic physics: were thestrong force to be greater by as little as 5 percent, or the electromagnetic force tobe greater by perhaps 4 percent, the production of carbon and oxygen in the infantuniverse could have shut down.14Chemistry plays a double role here, first in revealing the fine-tuning required inorder that carbon should form, and second in implying the (plausibly) necessary rolethat carbon plays in the economy of life generally. These are two separate arguments.But the decisive element in establishing the fine-tuning itself still lies at the level offundamental physics: must the relevant physical constants be constrained within atight percentage range so that the chemistry of the universe should be open to thedevelopment of life? Do any other plausible instances of fine-tuning exist in thebasic chemistry of the raw materials required for living processes? Other chaptersin this volume will take up this question.Fine-tuning in biology?What are the prospects for discovering instances of fine-tuning in realms other thanphysics and chemistry – in biology, say? This question will be explored elsewherein this volume, but it may still be helpful at this stage to draw some inferences firstfrom what we have just learned about the structure of the fine-tuning argument inits native home, cosmology.Biological considerations play an indispensable role in all discussions of cosmicfine-tuning. But in this role they are not part of the fine-tuning claim itself. Typically,as we have seen, proponents of fine-tuning allege that an unexpected degree ofconstraint on some physical parameter or basic constant is necessary if some otherphysical condition is to be realizable in the universe. Then, in a separate argument,this latter condition is held to be necessary for the universe’s being open to thedevelopment of complex life.This second element in every fine-tuning discussion draws on biology only inthe most general and speculative way. This is not the sort of biology that one findsin a textbook, but the kind science-fiction writers without number have used inimagining living forms that escape almost any restriction that analogies with theterrestrial life we know would be likely to impose. So the search for conditionsnecessary foranyform of life throughout the universe has to proceed very warilyindeed (Feinberg and Shapiro,1980). Still, the conditions that have so far playeda part in the fine-tuning discussions (the need for elements more complex than14This is quite tentative: the results of the difficult calculations entailed have to be regarded with caution. See thechapters in this volume by Barrow and Livio (Chapters7 and8)."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"5Tuning fine-tuning81hydrogen and helium to form the material basis of living process, the need forseveral generations of stars to generate the heavier elements, etc.) seem reasonablysecure.But the problem is that we do not have a cosmic biology in the sense in which wedohave a cosmic physics and chemistry. The life forms of earth, and consequentlythe biology built on them, have been shaped by the innumerable particularities ofthe terrestrial environment over billions of years. Countless independent causallines have crossed and recrossed to form the unique biota of the earth of today andyesterday. The limited teleonomic order imposed by natural selection on individualevolutionary lineages is nowhere near enough to yield anything that could plausiblycount as a cosmic biology. The evidence of convergence in the evolutionary record,so persuasively presented in recent work, does carry some weight in suggestinguniversals of various kind (Conway Morris,2003). But this still falls far short ofproviding an abstract framework within whichallliving processes would have to fit.The prospect of terrestrial biology’s suggesting a direct fine-tuning relationshipon its own account might therefore be regarded as problematic. It would seemthat some feature of the complex living processes described in our biology wouldhave to demand fine-tuning on the part of some underlying physical parameter.The immediate problem here is that living processes, as these are understood interrestrial biology, do not necessarily have cosmic scope. Other worlds could wellbe found in our universe where biological processes of a substantially different sortflourish, calling into question the significance of an earth-related “fine-tuning.”The second problem, of course, would be to establish a link to a physical parameterrequiring fine-tuning for the biological process to go forward.Still, it is worth carrying the matter a stage further. Take the issue of inevitabilityin evolutionary biology, for instance. A good case can be made for holding thatevolution tends to converge over the course of time on certain favored forms (seeConway Morris,2003, for an extended defense of the inevitability thesis). Somewould go even further, starting with the origin of life in a suitable environment andmoving easily to the eventual appearance of a technologically competent civilizationcapable of communicating with us. Others, however, would emphatically rejectany suggestion of overall directionality in the evolutionary process, pointing to themany sources of contingency along the way – notably the occurrence of a majorcatastrophe on a global scale.15In a different, although related, context, the originof life is taken by some to be of common, even inevitable, occurrence across thecosmos, whereas others would see complex life, at least, as a rare event, dependenton a host of contingent factors.1615Stephen J. Gould (1989)would be regarded as the main defender of this position.16Here the contrast could be, for example, between the views of Christian de Duve (1995) and those of, say,Francis Crick (1981)."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"82Ernan McMullinDoes this issue bear on considerations of fine-tuning? Strictly speaking, thishardly seems to be the case. Fine-tuning connotes a certain precariousness, a con-dition barely met. Features such as inevitability or convergence in the story ofevolution convey just the opposite. Evolutionary sequences are sometimes saidto converge on forms possessing specific functions with no hint of the environ-mental constraints required for this to happen. Claims of inevitability or conver-gence could be either (broadly) empirical, based on scrutiny of the historical recordof terrestrial evolution, or (broadly) theoretical, based on how Darwinian evolu-tion is supposed to work in general terms. But in neither case does anything likefine-tuning appear to be involved – quite the reverse, it might seem. Nor is thebroader claim any better: that the cosmos is pregnant with life and the originof life faces no particular barrier in the widest variety of cosmic circumstances.One might argue that a universe of this biophilic sort is antecedently unlikely andthat some specific sort of fine-tuning at the physical level is responsible for ouruniverse’s being biophilic rather than more sparing in offering life support. Thiswould seem to reduce to the fine-tuning argument in physics that we have alreadyseen, although this could depend on what connotation, exactly, one attaches to“biophilic.”So far the issue has been whether fine-tuning, in the relatively precise sense thatthat term has acquired in cosmology, is likely to find fresh application in biology.The answer has been, on the whole, negative. But suppose one were to address theissue more broadly. Fine-tuning is an instance of design, real or apparent; but designis itself a much broader category. The indications of design in the living worlddescribed in loving detail by seventeenth-century exponents of natural theology,such as Robert Boyle and John Ray, did not point to fine-tuning as the clue to theinvolvement of intelligence. Fine-tuning is a highly specific sort of clue, as we haveseen, leading to a specific set of alternative responses. Searching for evidence ofdesignin the living world today, on the other hand, might perhaps have a higherlikelihood of success, judging by the record, than trying to find analogs of fine-tuning there.Might one infer, then, to something like design from claims of evolutionaryinevitability or convergence? One could, of course, if one were to postulate a direc-tive agency of some sort at work within the evolutionary process, itself impellingthe process onward to higher and higher levels of complexity. Bergson’s ́elan vitaland Teilhard de Chardin’s radial energy would be of this sort. But it has to besaid that suggestions of this kind have, on the whole, met with a frosty receptionfrom evolutionary biologists. Such views challenge the overall adequacy of theneo-Darwinian explanatory framework, not a popular stand; critics respond thatthis framework is perfectly capable of handling whatever directions evolution canbe shown to have taken."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"5Tuning fine-tuning83It was the introduction of this framework that undermined the case for designin the first place – design, that is, that would be associated with specific complexfeatures of the living world. Its modern proponents often present the neo-Darwinianframework as having potentially universal applicability: wherever in the universe acertain set of conditions, centered on descent with modification, is to be found, evo-lution is bound to occur (see, for example, Dawkins,1983). The only contingenciesthat arise in this scenario have to do with the satisfying of the required conditionsand the presence in advance of reproducing organisms. (How well a Darwiniantype of schema applies to the origin of the first cells is still a matter of debate.)Holding that the contingencies are easily satisfied so that life must be common-place throughout the vast spaces and times of the universe (the “pregnancy” thesis)has suggested to some that such a profusion would indicate the agency of designin some form (see, for example, Davies,1999). Yet one wonders why frequency ofoccurrence, as against rarity, should of itself be significant in this context. If any-thing, extreme rarity would appear to be a more likely lead, if it could be established.But this is to barely scratch the surface of the burgeoning life sciences.The prospects for finding indications in those sciences for fine-tuning propermay not be bright. But perhaps the notion of design might still prove capaciousenough to extend into current discussions of such themes as optimality and fitness.It would need to do so at the cosmic level. At the local level of terrestrial biology,the many-world alternative would be all too obvious so that even the appearance ofdesign would hardly be countenanced. It may be worth recalling at this point, forthe historical morals that might be drawn, an earlier appeal to cosmic fitness thatelicited many of the same questions as those we have just been wrestling with.Fitness of the environmentL. J. Henderson’s celebrated book,The Fitness of the Environment(1913), is oftencited as a harbinger of the fine-tuning theme in discussions of the place of life inthe universe. Having worked through the complexities of that theme, we are nowin a better position to judge how close his contributions came to the contemporarynotion of fine-tuning, and in what ways and for what reasons they fell short of it.17Henderson is not talking about the fitness of life for the environment in which it findsitself. He makes it clear that this can be explained along Darwinian lines: naturalselection has shaped life to survive and, when possible, thrive in the particularenvironment it inhabits and to compensate for changes in that environment.1817Iamindebted in this section to Iris Fry’s perceptive analysis of Henderson’s book (1996).18One could also have recourse to a broadly anthropic consideration, although Henderson did not take this tack.If (as Henderson believed) a multitude of planetary worlds exist where life could possibly be found, one wouldexpect to find it in an environment for which it is fitted."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"84Ernan McMullinBut this was not what Henderson meant by “fitness of the environment.” It wasnot where he believed a complement to the Darwinian account needed to be given.What had struck him was the multiple “fitnesses” of the physical environment forthe biochemistry of life in general. And by “environment,” he meant to include boththe “external” and “internal,” with emphasis on the latter, following the practiceinitiated by Claude Bernard, who had had much to say about themilieu int ́erieur,as he termed it. Henderson was intrigued by the crucial roles that water and carbondioxide (and at a deeper level their three elemental constituents, hydrogen, oxy-gen, and most especially carbon) played in all living processes. Those processesrequired complexity, as well as the capacity for self-regulation and metabolism. Theproperties of the three elements and the two compounds made from them seemedto him so ideally suited to these requirements (a conclusion worked out by him inimpressive empirical detail) that some sort of explanation of this was called for.Henderson’s concern was not with particular environments, such as that of earth,but with the cosmic environment (as he saw it) that is revealed by astronomy. Hewent to some lengths to argue the optimality of the advantages offered by the two keycompounds and, thus, of their three component elements as well. He discussed thepossibility that water and carbon might be of frequent occurrence on other planets,arguing for the superiority of water over any other known solvent in the bioticcontext, as well as for carbon over silicon. He did not go as far as to propose themas necessary conditions for life, a more difficult case to make. Nevertheless, someresonances with the account of fine-tuning sketched above were already apparent.His main theme was the remarkable fitness of the chemical environment for life,and his problem was how to account for this. He ruled out chance: the coinci-dences between the properties of the favored elements and the needs of life are tooremarkable for this to be a plausible response. Likewise, he dismissed design asan alternative explanation. The notion of design was outside the realm of science;besides, to an agnostic like himself, it held no attraction. What is particularly strik-ing is that he also excluded the many-universe alternative, the response favored(as we have seen) by many recent cosmologists. He realized that talking about thesuperior merits in the biotic context of the three favored elements might suggestcomparison with other possible chemistries that had a different repertoire of ele-ments. But this would introduce “other possible worlds in which matter may havedifferent properties and energy different forms” (Henderson,1916,p.326; quotedin Fry,1996,p.163). And he will have nothing to do with such purely speculative“hypothetical worlds,” restricting himself quite explicitly to the chemistry of thecosmos that we know. This was sufficient, in his estimate, to make his point aboutthe remarkable biotic optimality of the three elements and their compounds.Nowhere in his discussion did Henderson suggest the specifically anthropic factorof a selection effect caused by our necessarily finding ourselves in the only one of a"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"5Tuning fine-tuning85large ensemble of universes in which wecouldfind ourselves. It clearly would nothave occurred to him, any more than to anyone else of his time, to take seriouslythe possibility of an ensemble of other actually existing universes governed bydifferent physical laws as a means of solving his problem. He had already made hisnegative attitude clear in regard to hypothetical alternative chemistries. But moreto the point, as far as the comparison with fine-tuning is concerned, his argumentwasnot specifically anthropic in the first place. He talked about the conditions forlife in general, about what makes life flourish.Humanlife was not central to thepoint he was making, as it is in the fine-tuning argument.But if this was the case, what were his remaining options? How was he to accountfor the type of “fitness” he found so intriguing? He was left, in his view, with onlyone possible alternative, although he candidly recognized its shortcomings. Likemany others of his day, he was a strong believer in evolution as a cosmic process,of which Darwinian natural selection governing living things would be one majormanifestation. So (he suggested) a natural property must have been inherent in theoriginal unorganized matter and energy bringing about an evolutionary process thatin turn shaped the differentiated properties of the elements, making three of theseoptimally ready for the origin and flourishing of life.Henderson described his view as the “new teleology,” since in some sense lifewasdescribed as a goal of the broader cosmic process. But he also insisted thatthe process was purely mechanistic; he wanted no part of the popular vitalisms ofthe day. Could he have it both ways? Could he expand the notion of a mechanismsufficiently to allow it to accomplish purpose-like goals without involving con-scious purpose? Aristotle might have had advice to offer! If a mechanistic processaccomplished goals or valued ends (as a thermostat does), it would of course promptanewseries of queries as to how this itself came about. Although he was neverquite satisfied with his explanation of the fitness of the chemical environment, heremained convinced that an explanation ofsomesort was needed.YetHenderson has been hailed by some as an early defender of the type ofargument labeled today as fine-tuning. How accurate is this identification? There isclearly some basis for it; but the tuning metaphor does not reflect the thrust of hisargument particularly well. First, the positives. He recognized how well on acosmicscale certain properties of the chemical environment fitted the requirements of thelife process in general. And he found this degree of fit striking enough to warrant anexplanation. Further, the alternative explanations he considered (and rejected) aresimilar to those found in contemporary accounts of fine-tuning. His own preferredexplanation, as we have seen, was interestingly different from these: a process ofasupposedly mechanistic sort that shaped the chemical properties of an initiallyunorganized chaos (the Principle of Indifference?) so as to make it possible for lifeto come into being and flourish."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"86Ernan McMullinMight this process be described, even broadly, as fine-tuning? It does not seemso. Fine-tuning implies a precise standard toward which the tuned activity is tobe adjusted. Henderson did not suggest a standard of this sort that would permitlife to go forward. Rather, the focus of his argument was on the multiplicity ofways in which the properties of the favored elements and their compounds conspiretogether, as it were, to provide a suitable environment for life. That environmentwassketched in only a general way, with no suggestion of a specific quantitativeparameter, the close approach to which in the constitution of nature is the occasionof surprise. Thus, his argument does not have the logical structure we have seen thefine-tuning argument to have.In the Henderson approach, what is regarded as significant is the manifold fitnessfor life of the cosmic chemical environment in general. One might perhaps describethis as “tuning,” in an extended sense of that term. But it would be more illuminatingto situate the “fitness” to which Henderson pointed as the sort of considerationthat, more generally, had already prompted arguments of the classical design sort,although of course with a novel twist and a resolute refusal to follow through to theclassical design conclusion.Four alternative responses to claims of cosmic fine-tuningIn conclusion, it may be helpful to evaluate the four alternative responses to claimsof cosmic fine-tuning outlined above.19Chance:One might simply dismiss as chance the cosmic constraints requiredfor the universe to be life bearing. The parameter in question had to havesomevalue, one might say, so why not this one? It need have no further significance. Theuniverse, it might be said, is a contingent affair, and fine-tuning should be seen in thatlight. Such a response is impossible to refute, strictly speaking. The challenge to itcomes, as we have seen, from two alternatives that present fine-tuning as potentiallysignificant. Scientists on the whole seem uneasy about setting aside the quest forexplanation, as the recourse to chance does. One can detect a note of urgency,almost, in many of the discussions of the original fine-tuning claim in the late1970s and early 1980s: leaving the initial tight cosmic setting of the energy densitysimply as a given was obviously a troubling prospect. Just as troubling, perhaps, tosome was the leap to an infinity of universes advocated by Collins and Hawking.And even more troubling to others was undoubtedly the rapidly growing interestof the broader community in the dramatic reappearance of indications of design innatural science at the cosmic level. In their view, an alternative responsehadto befound.19Edward Harrison suggests a fifth alternative: intelligent observers able to fine-tune cosmic constants on theirown account (1995). On this, see Barrow (2002,p.286)."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"5Tuning fine-tuning87Consequence of an advance in theory:This reaction defined a second way todeal with the fine-tuning challenge: work, as Alan Guth did, toward a theoreticaladvance that would eliminate, or at least significantly reduce, the need for fine-tuning of the initial energy density. In the interim, simply assume that such anadvance will someday be made. At the level of cosmic beginnings, scientific theoryis more than ordinarily fragile – and quite evidently incomplete in the absence of aunifying successor to relativity theory and quantum theory. There is reason to thinkthat a re-evaluation of fine-tuning claims in general may well lie somewhere downthe road. This is obviously less likely in the case of nomic fine-tuning than in thesimpler case of the tuning of an apparently contingent parameter such as energydensity.The two anthropic responses are, of course, the ones that have caught people’sattention. Both involve ontological assertions that far transcend the observableuniverse. Both make essential reference to the human factor. Both draw implicitly orexplicitly on the weak Anthropic Principle: human questioners like us are bound, ofnecessity, to find themselves in a universe that satisfies whatever cosmic conditionsare required for life to be able to develop in at least one region within it. As thesequestioners regard their universe, they will inevitably discover it to be able to satisfythese conditions. This response of itself does not, of course, relieve the puzzlementoccasioned by the discovery of fine-tuning. The original question still has to befaced: is the fact that our universe is fine-tuned in regard to a particular parameter,and thus life hospitable, significant or not? Is it no more than chance, a piece ofgood luck for us, a quirk in our current physical theories? At this point the twoanthropic responses diverge.Many-universe postulate:The first of these (the “scientific” one) in its strongestform postulates a vast ensemble of existent universes featuring a wide distribution ofvalues of the relevant parameter. This response has a quite complex structure, a pointthat can easily be missed. Some philosopher–critics have charged that although themany-universe hypothesis would give reason to believe thatsomeuniverse wouldbe life hospitable, it would of itself give no reason to suppose that that universewould beours,inall its particularity. Hence, the hypothesis does not explain whythisuniverse turns out to be fine-tuned, and the fact thatouruniverse is fine-tunedthus fails to support the hypothesis (see, for example, White,2000).20One need not enter into contested issues about individuation to see what iswrong with this argument. Nor does one need to call on Bayesian reasoning tobe convinced that the many-universe hypothesis does not, of itself, explain why20At the end of his analysis, White concludes: “Postulate as many other universes as you wish, they do not makeit any more likely thatoursshould be life-permitting, or that we should be here. So our good fortune to exist ina life-permitting universe gives us no reason to suppose that there are many universes” [emphasis added]. Fora critique, see Manson and Thrush (2003, pp. 67–83)."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"88Ernan McMullinthisuniverse in its particularity rather than another is fine-tuned for life. Rather,one has to call on a second, additional strand of argument along anthropic lines toshow how the many-universe response as a whole works. That we should live in alife-hospitable universe rather than elsewhere obviously requires no explanation:it is a necessary truth. In the many-universe line of argument, whatdoesrequireexplanation is that there should be a universe of thisgeneralkind available. Andthis the many-universe hypothesis secures. Our existence ensures the existence ofsome life-hospitable universe and thus supports that hypothesis, which has such auniverse as its consequence. This attack on the logic of the many-universe responsefails.However, the multiverse version of the postulate is still not much more thanafascinating, but highly speculative, mathematical exercise at this point. It facesmany testing challenges (Elliset al., 2003, 2006; Manson,2003). Is the notion ofan infinitely realized domain of existent universes even coherent?21This issue hasbeen debated since Aristotle’s time and it is still not resolved. Doesn’t making themultiverse eternal simply serve to evade the normal scientific question of how it wasitself generated? How is one to ensure that the “bubble” universes brought aboutby the unending series of inflation events exhibit lawlike behavior ofanysort, letalone the probabilistic distribution of such behaviors that the fine-tuning argumentrequires? If the notion of a multiverse is prompted primarily by the need to explaincosmic fine-tuning, does it not itself pose numerous demands for explanation in itsown right?A many-universe theory involving only a single inflation event would seem moreaccessible to scientific test at least. But even there, many issues remain unresolved.Do scalar fields exist? How is one to set up and validate a distribution function overthe ensemble of universes? A generating process would have to be specified, buthow is this process itself to be explained? That is, whythisprocess rather than someother one? And might there not be some special conditions required to initiate thesort of inflation under consideration, leaving open the possibility that an elementof fine-tuning might find its way back into the process that was supposed to banishit once and for all?Further, the invocation of a many-universe solution does not of itself necessarilylay fine-tuning to rest: every time fine-tuning makes its appearance, the argumentseems to be carried a level higher in order to rescue the Principle of Indifference.But this introduction of a higher-level ensemble, if it can be made specific enough,seems in practice itself to involve a further round of fine-tuning, and so the dialecticcontinues, at each level becoming more ontologically extravagant.21Barrow and Tipler point out that if the notion of an infinitely realized universe were to be allowed, the originalgrounds for postulating inflation would no longer hold good. Why not argue instead that in a chaotically randominfinite universe “theremustexist a large, virtually homogeneous, and isotropic region, expanding sufficientlyclose to flatness...sothat after fifteen billion years it looks like our universe?” (1986,p.437)."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"5Tuning fine-tuning89One final objection that is often voiced may be less serious than it looks. Can theinvocation of a multiplicity of universes permanently inaccessible to our instrumentsqualify as physics? The answer is yes, in principle it can if certain conditions are met.Retroduction, effect to cause inference, is central to the natural sciences generally:the physicist who infers to the structure of the atom or molecule on the basis of anemission spectrum or the geologist who infers to the inner structure of the earthon the basis of seismographic data is employing standard retroductive reasoning(see McMullin,1992). This is the reasoning that underlies explanatory theoriesthat account for inductively arrived at empirical regularities and that give cognitiveaccess to causal structures that are, more often than not, not directly accessible to us.Such theories are warranted by their ability to account for the data that originallycalled them forth, but even more by their performance over time, their abilityto overcome anomaly, their successfully predicting novel results, their continuedsurvival in the face of severe test, their ability to unify previously disparate domains.The list of the desirable epistemic virtues is long (McMullin,2007).Amany-universe theory is retroductive in form; the existence of the ensembleof universes that constitute its postulated causal structure will be warranted onlyto the extent that the theory itself behaves well over time. An adequate theory ofinflationary origination over an ensemble, with our own universe as the (admittedlysole) observational warrant, would be enough, provided that the theory could bemade sufficiently specific (there are doubts about the present candidates in thatregard) and that it comes to be supported by something more than accounting forthe original puzzling fine-tuning, a slender reed when considered on its own.A caring Creator:The fourth alternative, the other anthropic response, is of amuch more familiar kind; it comes from a quarter remote from scientific cosmology.Its premise, a Creator who has a care for human concerns, is a standard feature ofthe Western religious tradition. This response is the only one of the four that canbe said to “explain” the fine-tuning phenomenon in something like the familiarsense of “explain”: ascribing the fine-tuning to the motive of an agent. But, ofcourse, putting it that way tends to mask the unfamiliarity of the agency and theproblematic character of ascribing the fine-tuning to a Creator’s motives. In itsfavoristhat, unlike the many-universe alternative, it requires no new postulation,and it can appeal to a long philosophical tradition stretching back to Augustine andbeyond, with highly developed metaphysics in its support. Against it is an equallyfamiliar array of objections to the whole idea of a Creator and to the demand foran explanation of the universe’s existence.Sorting through the four alternativesAdecision between the four alternatives depends, then, in significant part onprior philosophical and theological commitments. To call it a decision between"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"90Ernan McMullinalternatives ought not to be taken to suggest that each explains the fine-tuning inthe same sense of “explains.” The first alternative, that fine-tuning is simply chance,maintains that no explanation is needed. The second recommends holding back, inthe expectation that, in the long run, the supposed fine-tuning may prove illusory.The third takes fine-tuning seriously and explains it as a selection effect. The fourthalso takes it seriously but draws instead on a prior belief in a Creator for whomhumanity holds a special place.Someone for whom neither of the anthropic explanations is attractive mightinsist on fine-tuning’s being no more than a chance phenomenon, or will counselcaution and delay in regarding fine-tuning itself as established. Someone to whomneither of these responses seems at all plausible but who also rejects any sort ofappeal that transcends, in principle, the possible reach of natural science will beinclined to opt for the daring ontological enlargement that goes with the many-universe hypothesis. If there is some indication that this can actually be broughtwithin the range of physical theory, so much the better. Someone who is alreadycomfortable with belief in a Creator will find fine-tuning in no way a challenge; quitethe reverse.Interestingly, the theistic response undercuts the need for a many-universe onebecause, if accepted, it makes the other redundant. In the absence of an alreadyreasonably credible many-universe theory, a theist is likely to be skeptical aboutthe need to add an ensemble of unobservable but real universes just to reduce fine-tuning in our own universe to a selection effect. From the theistic perspective, thisis simply not called for. On the other hand, adopting the multiverse alternativewould leave the theistic position still in place: we would still need to ask whythe multiverse itself exists, even if it were eternal, and would refuse to accept thepossibility of a universe’s coming to be from nothing pre-existent, all talk of aquantum vacuum notwithstanding. On the other side, many-universe proponentsare likely to be skeptical of venturing outside the possible range of cosmologicaltheory, or indeed to be suspicious of any kind of recourse to theological solutionsin explaining a feature of the natural world.What is fascinating about this epistemic situation is that it may set theistic beliefand natural science in partial competition with each other, without either venturingoutside its proper area of competence. Many writers have held this to be impossible,that the realms of science and religion are in principle “non-overlapping magisteria,”to recall Gould’s well-known formulation of the “NOMA” principle (Gould,1999).It is not as though the two are offering competing explanations here for the samefeature of nature in the same sense of “explanation,” so that if one is right, the otheris wrong. Rather, if one is right, the other is unnecessary, although not refuted. Theproponent of a multiverse does not (or at least should not) claim to explain howa multiverse could of itself come to be, or why it should exist in the first place."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"5Tuning fine-tuning91Believers in a Creator would, of course, see this as the work of creation, althoughthey might also want to emphasize that it was not as a cosmic explanation that theycame to belief in God in the first place. So the two sides of this dialectic are not instrict contradiction with each other, although under certain circumstances they arestill in competition.If the phenomenon of fine-tuning can be assumed to be real, does the abilityof the theistic position to handle it so neatly count as confirmatory evidence forthat position? Here religious believers should tread very warily. The assumptionabove has been that belief in a Creator is for many a given, in need of no furtherconfirmation. For them, the many-universe extrapolation is simply redundant. Butif the two anthropic alternatives were to be regarded as rivals, each in search ofconfirmation, the epistemic situation would change. The independent plausibilityof the many-universe response, however that may be assessed, could limit theconfirmatory force of fine-tuning for belief in a Creator. And, of course, one wouldhave to keep in mind the other two possible responses to fine-tuning, both quitedifficult to evaluate in practice. The apparent fine-tuning might not be significant tobegin with if either of these two were to be correct. Yet it is quite striking that somenotable physicists take it seriously enough to warrant their calling into existence aninfinity of universes co-existent with ours.Still, the epistemic situation is so difficult to assess that it is clearly prematureto make fine-tuning the key to a new natural theology (Corey,1993, 2001). Itseems best then, for the moment, at least, to fall back on the weaker notion ofconsonance. Fine-tuning is quite evidentlyconsonantwith belief in a Creator. Tosome, this conclusion might appear too weak: if theistic belief explains fine-tuning,they might argue, this should count epistemically in its favor. Strictly speaking this istrue (assuming of course that fine-tuning is in fact the case.) However, the epistemicissues surrounding the fine-tuning argument are so intricate and so difficult to assessthat making fine-tuning an independent motive for theistic belief may invite moretrouble for its proponents than it is worth (McMullin,1988,p.71).The fine-tuning debate has directed the attention of physicists to issues of anunfamiliar sort. This of itself has been a major contribution. How much weight, forexample, should cosmologists give to the Principle of Indifference? That is, howserious a problem would it be to leave a constraint on critical cosmic conditionsunexplained? Suppose (per impossibile,Isuspect) that some future theory were toexplain why the fundamental constants of nature have the values they do, would thiseliminate fine-tuning? On the assumption that the universe had a temporal begin-ning, would the transition from (literally) nothing to an inconceivably energeticbeginning be subject in principle to explanation in terms of physical theory? Onthe assumption that the universe did not have a temporal beginning, is the demandfor explanation of why it should exist in the first place still a legitimate one? If the"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"92Ernan McMullinchoice were to be between the two anthropic alternatives, there being no evidencefor the many-universe one other than fine-tuning, on what basis would one presumeto make the choice?Questions like these do not fall into any of the categories to which we areaccustomed. Yet they are real questions, ones that insistently pose themselves aswe explore the boundary-lands of contemporary cosmology. They are quite surelynot going to go away, so we had best give serious thought as to how they should beapproached.AcknowledgmentsIamindebted to Iris Fry for her helpful comments on a first version of this essay, toGrant Mathews and Bill Stoeger for their help in illuminating some of the darkcorners in the physics of the story, and to John Barrow for effective editorialadvice.ReferencesBarrow, J.

W. DaviesThe problem of what exists: whythisuniverse?Einstein reportedly said: “What really interests me is whether God had any choicein the creation of the world”.1What he meant by this informal remark was whetherthe physical universe must necessarily exist as it is or whether it could have beenotherwise (or could have not existed at all). Today, almost all scientists believethat the universe could indeed have been otherwise; no logical reason exists whyithasto be as it is. In fact, it is the job of the experimental scientist to determinewhichuniverse actually exists, from among the many universes that might possiblyexist. And it is the job of the theoretician to construct alternative models of physicalreality, perhaps to simplify or isolate a particular feature of interest. To be credible,these models must be mathematically and logically self-consistent. In other words,they represent possible worlds.Let me give one example from my own research (Birrell and Davies,1978). Theequations of quantum field theory describing a system of interacting subatomicparticles are often mathematically intractable. But several “toy models” exist, theequations for which may be solved exactly because of special mathematical features.One of these, known as the Thirring model, describes a two-spacetime-dimensionalworld inhabited by self-interacting fermions. This impoverished model of realityis designed to capture some features of interest to physicists in the real world. It isnot, obviously, an attempt to describe the real world in its entirety. Nevertheless, itis apossiblereal world. The universe could have been the Thirring version. But it isnot. Given, then, that alternative possible worlds exist, what is it that decides whichuniverse among this (probably infinite) array of possibilities is to be dignified as1See, for example, www.humboldt1.com/∼gralsto/einstein/quotes.html.

Or, to express it more poeticallyby using Stephen Hawking’s (1988)words, “What is it that breathes fire into theequations and makes a universe for them to govern?”Only two “natural” states of affairs commend themselves in this regard. Thefirst is that nothing exists; the second is that everything exists. The former we mayrule out on observational grounds. So might it be the case that everything that canexist, does exist? That is indeed the hypothesis proposed by some cosmologists,most notably Max Tegmark (2003, 2004), although as we shall see some disputeremains over the definition of “everything.” Obviously, ifeverythingexisted, humanobservations would merely sample an infinitesimal subset of the whole of physicalreality.At first sight, the hypothesis “everything exists” appears extravagant – evenabsurd. The problem, however, for those who would reject this thesis is that if lessthan everything exists, then there must be some rule that divides those things thatactually exist from those that are merely possible but are in fact non-existent. Oneis bound to ask: what would this rule be? Where would it come from? And whythatrule rather than some other?Another objection to the hypothesis that everything exists is that it seems tobe an extraordinarily complicated explanation for what is observed, and henceundesirable on the grounds of Occam’s razor. But this can be misleading. In certaincircumstances, everything can be simpler than something. Consider an infinitecrystal lattice. That regular periodic structure is very simple and can be describedby specifying a few bits of data such as the periodicity and orientation of the crystalplanes. Now remove a random subset of atoms from this array. By the algorithmicdefinition of “randomness” (Chaitin,1988), this subset requires a lot of informationto describe it (because it is not “algorithmically compressible”). What remains is,by definition, also random. So each subset, by itself, needs a lot of information tospecify it – but the two subsets, when combined, require very little information.In that sense, the whole is simpler than the sum of its parts. In the same way, theset of all possible universes may be (algorithmically) simpler than one or a finitecollection of universes. (There is considerable scope for these informal statementsto be placed on a sound mathematical footing.)Historically, most scientists and philosophers have assumed that only one realuniverse exists, and this should probably remain the default position today in theabsence of direct evidence for the existence of any other universes. Monotheistictheologians sought to explain the specific nature of the universe (that is, whythisuniverse rather than that) by appealing to divine selection: God made this universe(rather than some other universe that God had the power to make) as a free choice,perhaps with certain outcomes in mind (such as the emergence of sentient beings)(Haught,1986)."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"6Fitness and the cosmic environment99On the whole, scientists have ignored the matter, it being deemed that the properjob of a scientist is to take this particular universe as given and get on with the jobof figuring out what is going on in it. Some scientists have taken a more proactivestance by positively denying that there isanysignificance in the specific nature ofthe universe, taking the attitude that there isno reasonwhy it is as it is rather thanotherwise. The problem with this position is that science is supposed to explain theworld in logical and rational terms. That is, scientists offer reasons for why thingsare as they are. Normally, this involves chains of reasoning that ultimately leadback to the laws of physics – considered (at least by physicists) to be the bedrockof physical reality. Thus, in answer to the question of, say,Why did the snow melt?,a (partial) scientific explanation might go as follows: because it was warmed bythe sun, which was heated by thermonuclear reactions, which were triggered bythe high temperatures of the solar core, which was produced by the gravitationalattraction of the solar material, which moved according to the laws of gravity. If wenow ask,Why that law of gravity?, the scientist might well respond, “No reason;that’s just the way it is!” So a chain of reasoning in which each step is carefullylinked logically and rationally to a level below terminates abruptly with the claimthat the chain as a wholeexists reasonlessly. This bizarre backflip cuts the groundfrom under the entire scientific enterprise, because it roots the rationality of physicalexistence in the absurdity of reasonless laws (Davies,1991, 2007).Problems of a divine selectorIf the scientist is in trouble on this score, the theologian is not without problemseither. To offer a credible theistic explanation for the specific nature of the world,or for the actual form of the laws of physics, something must be said about thenature of God. (Merely declaring “God did it!” tells us nothing useful at all.) Anobviously necessary property of such a divine Creator is freedom of choice. Now,Christian theologians traditionally assert that God is anecessarybeing. If God existsnecessarily (that is, if it is logically impossible for God to not exist), then we areinvited to believe that this necessary being did not necessarily create the universe asit is (otherwise there is no element of choice, and nature is reduced to a subset of thedivine being rather than a creation of this being). But can a necessary being act in amanner that is not necessary? It is far from obvious to this writer that the answer isyes. On the other hand if, counter to classical Christian theology, God is regardedas not necessary butcontingent, then on what, precisely, are God’s existence andnature contingent? If we don’t ask, we gain nothing by invoking such a contingentGod, whose existence would then have to be accepted as a brute fact. One mightas well simply accept a contingent universe and be done with it. If we do ask, thenwe accept that reality is larger than God, and that an account of the universe must"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"100Paul C. W. Daviesinvolve explanatory elements beyond God’s being. But if we accept the existenceof such explanatory elements, why is there any need to invoke divine elements too?Attempts to reconcile a necessary God with a contingent single universe have along tradition.2Iamnot a good enough philosopher to know whether these attemptsare coherent; but I am bound to ask, even if such reconciliation were possible,whyGod freely chose to make this universe rather than some other. If the choice is purelywhimsical, then the universe is absurd and reasonless once more. On the other hand,if the choice proceeds from God’s nature (for example, a good god might make auniverse inhabited by sentient beings capable of joy), then one must surely ask,Why was God’s nature such as to lead tothischoice of universe rather than someother?This further worry would be addressed in turn by proving not only that Godexists necessarily, but that God’s entire nature is also necessary. Such a conclusionwould entail proving that, for example, an evil creator capable of making a worldfull of suffering is not merely undesirable, butlogically impossible.The fitness of the multiverseLet me then turn to the now fashionable notion of the “multiverse” theory as anexplanation for why the universe is as it is. Does this fare any better? The multiverseis defined to be an ensemble of universes within which the members may differfrom one another. These “universes” might be completely disconnected spacetimes,or spaces joined occasionally, perhaps only prior to some epoch or following oneanother sequentially (separated by some clear physical bounding event such asa big crunch), or merely widely separated contiguous spatial regions of a singlespacetime. (I use the word “universe” to denote a single member of this ensemble.)Crucially, these universes differ not just by “rearranging the furniture,” but in theunderlying laws of physics. As Martin Rees expresses it, what were hitherto believedto be universal, absolute, god-given laws are treated instead as merely local bylaws,valid only in our restricted cosmic patch (Rees,2001).The multiverse idea seems to offer progress. For example, one feature of theuniverse we would like to explain is why the underlying laws are biofriendly. Thiswas Henderson’s great insight: that nature is fit for life even as life is adapted tonature. He concluded his book with the clear statement: “The biologist may nowrightly regard the universe in its very essence as biocentric” (Henderson,1913).Given this now-uncontentious observation, we may then ask,why do the laws ofphysics have the requisite mathematical form and assume the relevant values ofvarious parameters within those laws, such that the universe may bring forth lifeand consciousness?The multiverse theory seeks to account for this remarkable2See, for example, Swinburne (1993)."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"6Fitness and the cosmic environment101and important property as an “observational selection effect.” The universe –thisuniverse – is observed by us to be biofriendly because it could not be observed atall, by us or anybody else, if it were biohostile.Something else in favor of the multiverse theory is that some sort of cosmicensemble is predicted naturally by combining two very fashionable branches ofscience: inflationary cosmology and string/M theory. The former is the standardmodel for how the universe emerged from the Big Bang displaying certain keyproperties, such as large-scale uniformity and (relatively) small-scale irregularity.3The latter is a mathematical theory that attempts to unify the various forces andparticles of nature into a final fundamental theory.4According to one interpretationof string/M theory, what were previously regarded as fixed parameters, such asthe masses of various particles or the strengths of the forces, are in fact frozenaccidents – haphazard values adopted in our particular inflation region (Susskind,2006). Most inflation regions would possess biohostile values, either too big or toosmall; but very rarely, by accident, a “Goldilocks” region would emerge in whichthings are just right for life, and those are the regions (universes) that are observedand perhaps commented on.That’s fine and blindingly obvious, as far as it goes. But does it get us out oftrouble? Does it provide an ultimate explanation for why things are as they are?No, it doesn’t. As described, the multiverse remains a subset of all possible uni-verses. For example, each universe comes equipped with a set of mathematical lawssimilar to those in our own universe. So a rule still divides what exists (universeswith laws similar to ours) from what does not (universes with radically differentlaws, lawless universes). Tegmark (2003, 2004) proposes to extend the multiverseby including universes in which the laws might be described by very differentmathematics, such as fractals or non-Cantorian sets. John Barrow (1991) consid-ered how laws based on alternative mathematics might preclude the existence ofinformation-processing systems rich enough to constitute observers. But even thisretains an arbitrary aspect. Defining universes in terms of their mathematical prop-erties is a prejudice that one might expect from a mathematical physicist, but itneed not represent the ultimate categorization. After all, Tegmark proposes a rulethat divides mathematical universes from non-mathematical ones. But one mightconsider all manner of non-mathematical criteria to label possible universes. Howabout universes constructed according to all possible aesthetic principles? Or allpossible gods? Or all possible ethical principles?Tosee the significance of this point, consider a multiverse that contains a sub-set of universes with all possible teleological principles. Now human beings findthemselves living in a universe that in many respects behavesas ifit is teleological.3See, for example Linde (1990).4See, for example, Greene (2000)."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"102Paul C. W. DaviesDarwinism is invoked in an attempt to eliminate teleology from the biological realm.But if one makes theaprioriassumption that our universe is but a component ofamultiverse, and that the said multiverse contains not merely copious examples ofuniverses with traditional differential equation laws but also universes with expli-citly teleological laws, then the job of the Darwinian is made considerably harder.Why? Well, it is now necessary to refute the claim that the universe appears teleo-logical because itisteleological. After all, why explain what we observe as reallyanon-teleological universe cunningly masquerading as a teleological one, whenplenty ofgenuinelyteleological universes are in the multiverse that could do thejob? To maintain this perverse stance, one would need to show that teleological uni-verses are in some sense sparser in the multiverse than non-teleological Darwinianuniverses; otherwise, on Bayesian grounds, one would be justified in retaining thehypothesis of teleology. For all I know, this may be the case; but it has certainly notbeen demonstrated.Similar reasoning may be applied to gods. All possible universes would certainlyinclude some with traditional deities, others with alien deities, yet others with nodeities. This might not bother scientists if the subset of deity-associated universeswere very rare among all biophilic universes. But can we be sure of this? A fewyears ago, I was asked to debate Peter Atkins about the existence of God. Asahumorous riposte to his invoking the now-standard multiverse explanations ofcosmic biofriendliness, I pointed out the following consequence of even a mild(that is, non-Tegmarkian) version of the multiverse theory. In the multiverse, atleast some universes must surely exist in which intelligent beings advance to thepoint of being able to simulate consciousness and virtual reality. Some so-calledstrong artificial intelligence (AI) specialists claim that even human beings will soonbe able to create conscious machines. It is but a small step from that threshold tothe point where such simulations reach a level of fidelity indistinguishable fromwhat we (or at least I) now observe. This small step has already been taken byHollywood (even if it is still awaited in the world of real science) in the guiseofThe Matrixmovies, wherein real and virtual realities are so alike that theyconfuse the participants (and the viewers). I have serious reservations about suchAI claims; but I am willing to concede, at least for the purposes of this argument,that such simulations are doable in principle and might in practice be achieved bybuilding a quantum supercomputer. At any rate, let us accept that a multiverse richenough to contain a limitless number of universes like ours will possess a subsetin which simulated reality by technological civilizations is routine. What are theimplications?First, it is amusing to note that the simulated beings in these universes stand in thesame relation to the simulating system (or its designer or operator) as human beingsonce stood in relation to the traditional biblical god. The simulating system is the"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"6Fitness and the cosmic environment103creator and sustainer of thein silico(or perhapsin quanto) beings and can observe,interfere with, and if necessary pull the plug on the simulated creatures. Ironically,far from abolishing a god, the multiverse seems to offer a convincing proof of sucha being’s existence, at least in a subset of universes. (This lighthearted remark findslittle favor among most theologians, who seek a god foreveryuniverse, not just thesimulated ones.)This line of speculation raises the obvious question of whether the universe thatwe humans observe is merely a simulation or is the Real Thing. Since a singlesimulating system may simulate an unlimited number of virtual worlds, the fakeuniverses would soon proliferate and outnumber the real ones, once the technologyhad been mastered. It follows that a random observer would be more likely to inhabita simulated world than a real world (Bostrom,2003). To express it more formally,unless we invoke an arbitrary existence rule that divides “real” from “simulated”consciousness, and hence real from simulated universes, a multiverse rich enoughto account for intelligent life is also a multiverse in which simulated beings arelikely to greatly outnumber unsimulated beings. Conclusion: We are very probablysimulated.Could such a wild idea be tested? Indeed it could, according to Barrow (2003).He points out that the simulating system need not bother to render consistentlyevery tiny feature of the simulated universes; it could achieve a great deal moreeconomically by running a so-so simulation and then tweaking the parameters fromtime to time. For the simulated beings, this would appear as the cosmic equivalentof the scenery wobbling. Barrow cites an example of such a possible “glitch” in thelaws of physics (2003).All this is entertaining stuff; but my serious point is that once one goes downthe slippery slope of ever-more elaborate multiverse models, the nature of realitybecomes exceedingly murky. The multiverse is no longer simply a set of plausibleuniverses with differing laws of physics and/or initial conditions. One must includein the grand inventory of universes all the fake ones along with the real ones. It getsworse. One may prove that a universal computer, or Turing machine, is capable ofsimulating another Turing machine, even one that is very different in structure. Thus,aPCmay simulate a cellular automaton (pixels that wink on and off on a screen)that itself may simulate, say, a Macintosh computer. Translated into virtual realities,this says that virtual worlds may contain beings that can simulate their own virtualworlds, and so on (and on,ad nauseam,evenifnotad infinitum,onaccount of thesecond law of thermodynamics). Any attempt to neatly decompose the multiverseinto “real” and “virtual” components seems doomed to failure. Rather, minds anduniverses become entwined, fractal-like, in a stupendously intricate amalgam. Theremay even be no “basement” universe, no ultimate ground of reality, on which tobuild such a “tower of turtles.” If so, the age-old dualism between mind and matter,"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"104Paul C. W. Daviescreator and creature, real and imaginary, dissolves away. Most people would regardthis conclusion as areductio ad absurdumof the multiverse hypothesis, althoughsome (for example, Rees,2003) may embrace it fearlessly. My own position is thata little bit of multiverse is good for you, and probably unavoidable given the recentdiscoveries of physics and cosmology; but following the slippery multiverse slopeto its ultimate conclusion is a descent into fantasy – quite literally!If Henderson were alive today: more water wondersWhen Henderson wroteThe Fitness of the Environment(1913), the nature of lifewas not well understood. The enormous advances in biochemistry, molecular biol-ogy, earth sciences, and astrobiology lay decades ahead. If Henderson were alivetoday, how might he extend his analysis in the light of modern discoveries? One veryobvious and dramatic development has a direct impact on his thesis, and that con-cerns the very word “environment.” Today, we know that life can not only survive,but thrive, in environments that in Henderson’s day would have been consideredutterly extreme for biology. Microbes inhabit the searing water spewing from deepocean volcanic vents and dwell in the sub-zero dry valleys of Antarctica. Otherorganisms inhabit pools so acidic that the fluid burns human flesh. Some microbes(called halophiles) can make a living in the extreme saline conditions of the mis-named Dead Sea and even in the radiation-drenched environment of nuclear wastepools (Postgate,1996). The one condition that does seem to be indispensable isaccess to liquid water. Henderson, who stressed the importance of several peculiarproperties of water for the success of life, would doubtless approve of the missionstatement of NASA’s Astrobiology Institute: “Follow the water!” Even the hardi-est extremophile needs liquid water. This suggests extending Henderson’s analysisto a much wider range of conditions in which liquid water exists, conditions thatHenderson would never have dreamed might permit life.What additional special properties of water might fascinate him?Some of the richest and most studied ecosystems are the deep ocean volcanicvents, inhabited byhyperthermophiles: microbes that live happily in temperaturesranging from 90◦Cto121◦C. (At depth, water does not boil at the usual 100◦C.)Typical of such organisms isPyrodictium abysii, with an optimum growth tem-perature of 110◦C. The current official record is held byPyrolobus fumerii, whichcan reproduce at a temperature of 121◦C, although I have witnessed a species ofarchaea metabolizing for thirty minutes at 130◦C. This raises obvious questionsabout water’s special properties: thermal conductivity and thermal capacity,solvent properties, interaction with cell membranes, viscosity, and surface tension.These properties, considered by Henderson in the temperature range associatedwith familiar life (0◦C–40◦C), need to be extended upward at least to 130◦C."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"6Fitness and the cosmic environment105One may also consider the opposite extreme of the very low temperatures inhab-ited by psychrophiles. Because of the need for water to remain liquid, and the declinein the rate of metabolism with temperature, psychrophilic life is not as extensive,active, or diverse as thermophilic life, but it is not without its interesting features.Water will not freeze at 0◦Cinsaline conditions, and highly saline water willsupport halophilic life even at low temperatures. Another circumstance in whichwater can remain liquid at temperatures well below the normal freezing point is inthin films on the surface of dirt and ice crystals. Although these films may be onlyafewmicrometers thick, reports exist of microbial communities inhabiting thisniche. Psychrophiles have been found living in the Siberian permafrost, growingand reproducing at temperatures of−10◦C. At temperatures as low as−20◦C,they take in needed materials from their environment and appear to be capable ofrepairing damage (Shiet al., 1997). Saline water will remain liquid at even lowertemperatures than this. The chemical and physical properties of water in ultracold,micrometer-thick layers differ radically from those of liquid water in more familiarconditions, and an extension of Henderson’s study into this regime would seem to beworthwhile. Similar “amazing water” analyses suggest themselves for conditionsof high salinity, acidity, and alkalinity.The earliest forms of life were almost certainly chemoautotrophs – organismsthat derive energy and make biomass directly from inorganic substances – sincethese can thrive in the complete absence of pre-existing organic material. Plantsare autotrophs, but they use the highly complex and sophisticated process of pho-tosynthesis, which must have taken a long time to evolve. Chemotrophy, in whichan organism uses chemical energy and inorganic raw materials, is simpler althoughless efficient. It also has the virtue that it can take place in the dark, thus openingup the subsurface zone for life (see the next section). Chemotrophs are known onearth today that can make a living directly from dissolved hydrogen and carbondioxide, which are turned into methane (Chapelleet al., 2002). It is likely that lifebegan with such organisms (Davies,2003). Their success depends crucially on threewater-related factors. The first is the ability of water to dissolve hydrogen and car-bon dioxide in sufficient concentration to provide the energy needed. The second isthe dissociation of water into hydrogen and oxygen when it passes through hot rocksdeep in the earth’s crust. This provides the hydrogen “fuel” that the chemotrophsuse, and results from a surprising and unusual process (Freundet al., 2002). Thethird is the ability of water to circulate deep into the crust and convect back to thesurface by percolating through the tiny rock pores. Without this continual cycling offluid, the supply of raw materials needed to sustain chemotrophic life at or near thesurface would soon be exhausted. The circulation rate, which will depend on suchfactors as the viscosity and coefficient of expansion of water, must be fast enough to“keep the food coming,” but not so fast as to fail to dissolve the released hydrogen."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"106Paul C. W. DaviesWater plays an indirect but crucial role in the story of life on earth throughgeophysical and astrophysical processes of which Henderson could have had noinkling. One of these is plate tectonics. Astrobiologists believe that a healthy planetmust continually recycle material if equable conditions are to be maintained. Forexample, on earth, carbon becomes sequestered in carbonate rocks and is releasedagain in the form of carbon dioxide when the rocks are subducted. Similarly, oxy-gen is prevented from building up to dangerous levels by tectonic activity, whichcontinually exposes fresh material to be oxidized. Part of the reason Mars seemsto be a dead planet is because its tectonic processes have ground to a halt. Water isa crucial ingredient in this story (Ragenauer-Liebet al., 2001). If the earth’s crustwere not hydrated, the basalt would be brittle. The water content gives the rockhigh plasticity that allows the plates to slide smoothly and material to flow steadilythrough the mantle.On a larger scale, water has helped shape the solar system. The solar nebula thatgave birth to the planets 4.6 billion years ago contained copious quantities of water.Because of the proximity of the hot protosun, the inner part of the nebula, where theearth formed, was largely desiccated and devolatilized. Water and volatile organicscondensed near the periphery of the nebula (beyond the so-called snow line). Thewater formed small ice crystals that stuck together to make snow. Snowflakesaggregated and trapped dust particles to make “dirty snowballs.” Over time, somesnowballs became large enough to gravitate significantly. According to the standardmodel, the cores of the giant planets probably formed this way, with the smallerdirty snowballs left over as comets and icy planetesimals. And giant planets play acrucial role in maintaining earth’s biofriendliness. Jupiter, in particular, is importantto life on earth by sweeping up rogue comets that would otherwise menace earth.But enough comets were able to get through to deliver water to our parched planet,without which life would be impossible. A key step in the foregoing sequence isthe aggregation of ice crystals. The stickiness of snow is a familiar property toall children who have engaged in a snowball fight. Without this stickiness, cometscould not have delivered water to the early earth.Water ice in the form of interstellar grains may have played an important role inprebiotic chemistry. These tiny particles permeate the interstellar medium, wherethey gather carbonaceous and silicate material and absorb ultraviolet radiation.Complex chemical processes on their surfaces produce a large variety of organicsubstances for possible later delivery to planets.As a final example of new discoveries being made about water’s remarkableproperties, consider the work of Kolesnikovet al.(2004), who have experimentedwith water confined to carbon nanotubes and found some highly unusual behaviorthat might be important for plant osmosis and the transport of protons across cellmembranes. If these expectations are confirmed, it would be worthwhile to elucidate"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"6Fitness and the cosmic environment107the quantum mechanics (QM) of this configuration to determine how sensitivelythe said properties would depend on the electron and nuclear masses or the fine-structure constant.Biogenesis: a damned close-run thing?Another area of research that has received a great deal of attention since Henderson’sbook was published is biogenesis, the problem of how life started from non-life inthe first place. In discussing the fitness of the environment for life, Henderson waslargely silent on the process of how life began – that is, the pathway whereby lifelesschemicals assembled themselves into the first living cell. It is one thing for the envi-ronment to be surprisingly fit for life, quite another for it to be fit for theemergenceof life. This “fitness of the incubator” is a largely unexplored area, for a very goodreason: we have almost no idea how lifedidoriginate (Davies,2003). If we knew theintricate chemical and physical pathway, we could determine just how critically thekey steps depended on this or that property. We could theoretically vary some ofthe parameters (such as the mass of the electron) and calculate what effect it hadon biogenesis. It is easy to imagine that the emergence of life depended on somefelicitous combination of chemical properties that relied sensitively on the mass ofthe electron (say). But it is equally easy to imagine that the special type of organizedcomplexity that represents life is robust enough to emerge under a wide range of con-ditions. In the absence of a plausible model for biogenesis, we simply do not know.It is, however, possible to offer some general remarks on the matter of fine-tuningand biogenesis. As I have discussed in the previous section, life today is extremelyresilient, able to exist across a wide range of conditions of pressure, temperature,pH, salinity, and even radiation exposure. The overriding restriction seems to be thepresence of liquid water. However, life on earth has had 4 billion years to evolvespecialized molecules and chemical procedures to optimize its performance andextend its environmental range. The first life forms are likely to have been muchmore at the mercy of a hostile environment, including a “fitness bottleneck” throughwhich the system had to pass before its longevity was ensured. We do not knowwhat this physical and chemical bottleneck was, but substantial fine-tuning mayhave been required for all the factors to work together. In itself, this is not a radicalsuggestion. The emergence of anything new requires a regime that is metastable,so that significant qualitative changes may take place. A physically and chemicallystable system is, by definition, one in which nothing new is likely to happen. Buta metastable system is also one that is likely to be compromised by changes in thefundamental physical parameters.Let me give an example of what I have in mind. We now have good evidencethat early life on earth was hyperthermophilic, consisting of microbes dwelling in"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"108Paul C. W. Davieshigh-temperature conditions (Davies,2003). Sequence analysis of ribosomal RNAenables organisms to be located on the tree of life, and the trend seems to be thatthe deepest branches of the tree are occupied by hyperthermophiles, suggestingthat these organisms are descendants of ancient life forms that evolved relativelylittle since the dawn of life (Brock and Goode,1996). Furthermore, from what isknown of the geological conditions of the early earth, our planet would have beensubjected to a ferocious cosmic bombardment for about 700 million years afterthe formation of the solar system. This would have rendered the surface of theearth very hazardous for life: the largest impacting objects would have releasedenough energy to swathe the planet in incandescent rock vapor and boil the oceansdry (Sleepet al., 1989; Maher and Stephenson,1988). The safest location was anumber of kilometers underground. Today, earth’s crust is found to be teemingwith microbes. Because temperature increases with depth, subsurface microbes areobligate thermophiles or hyperthermophiles. This too points to early life residingin a hot, deep location.It is not possible to conclude from this, however, that life actuallystartedin ahot, deep setting. Nevertheless, many astrobiologists believe that this is a plausi-ble scenario. If they are right, then we may identify a temperature bottleneck forbiogenesis. Above 100◦C, the stability of proteins and DNA is threatened withthermal disruption. Indeed, modern hyperthermophiles deploy customized heatshock enzymes that continually repair the thermal damage. So, on the one hand,the evidence points to a high-temperature setting for early life; on the other hand,modern life survives at high temperatures by using specialized molecules that haveevolved over billions of years. If the first life forms had to get by without thesespecialized molecules, their viability would have been a damned close-run thing, toparaphrase the Duke of Wellington. So I am hypothesizing that life emerged fromthe edge of thermal disruption, using molecules and chemical processes that wereonly marginally stable in those conditions. Such a regime is likely to be sensitive tochanges in parameters such as the fine-structure constant and particle masses, andonce again a careful analysis would seem to be worthwhile.Asecond, albeit even more speculative, possibility of fine-tuning in biogene-sis concerns the role of quantum mechanics. Obviously, at some level life mustreceive a quantum mechanical description. However, most researchers think ofbiochemical processes in terms of classical ball-and-stick models. To be sure,quantum mechanics determines the shapes and chemical affinities of biologi-cal molecules; but additional quantum effects, such as superposition, entangle-ment, and tunneling, are not normally regarded as significant. But this point ofview may be questioned (Davies,2004). Some circumstantial evidence exists fornon-trivial quantum effects in extant biology (Abbot, Davies and Pati,2008).Regarding biogenesis, if life emerged from the molecular realm, then it per-force emerged from the quantum realm. Two possibilities then present themselves:"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"6Fitness and the cosmic environment109(1) that quantum uncertainty was a limiting factor and (2) that a prebiotic systemexploited quantum effects in making the transition to life.Consider each possibility in turn. If life is defined as a form of organized com-plexity, then quantum fluctuations place constraints on the fidelity of organiza-tional processes. For example, complex molecular processes that demand fine-tunedchoreography of the component parts are subject to the inherent limitations thatapply to quantum timekeeping (Peˇsi ́ c, 1993). If the emergence of life was indeed aclose-run thing, then the probability of biogenesis may be sensitive to any relativeincrease in quantum fluctuations. The second possibility is that the transition to lifeinvolved certain key quantum steps, such as resonant reactions or tunneling, thatare highly sensitive to small changes in the heights and shapes of potential barriers,which in turn depend (to some extent) on the fine-structure constant and particlemasses.The role of catalysts in biogenesis is likely to have been absolutely critical.Biochemists have long suspected that catalytic surfaces, especially minerals suchas clay crystals or the pores of ocean basalt, were crucial in assembling com-plex organic molecules. The building blocks of these molecules are adsorbed ontothe surfaces and brought into conjunction, thereby facilitating their concatenation.Some researchers, such as Kauffman (1993) and Morowitzet al.(2000), envisageautocatalytic cycles (in three dimensions), in which the products of catalysis gen-erate more of the catalyst, forming a self-organizing system leading eventually tolife. The citric-acid cycle, which forms the basis of intermediary metabolism, is apossible candidate for a prebiotic self-organizing system. This cycle is already quitecomplicated, involving some dozens of different molecules, and the question arisesas to how sensitive the stability of this cycle would be to changes in the fine-structureconstant and particle masses. It is possible that this cycle of highly interdependentprocesses hangs together only as a result of some felicitous coincidences in thereaction and diffusion rates of different substances.Henderson’s legacyHenderson could scarcely have imagined that a few decades after he wrote his book,“the environment” for life would consist (at least in some people’s eyes) not just ofthe earth, or even the solar system, or even the universe, but of a vast assemblageof universes. Given that we may now entertain the possibility of alternative lawsin neighboring universes, and anthropic selection of fitness “oases” within themultiverse, how may the overall significance of Henderson’s fitness examples beassessed?I should first like to introduce a distinction between two quite different formsof fitness that are often conflated in these discussions. The first concerns caseswhere, had the laws of physics differed slightly from their observed form, life"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"110Paul C. W. Davieswould apparently have been impossible. I will not review here the many examplesof this argument.5The second has to do with the felicitous conjunction of dis-parate biofriendly properties, of which the most famous example – made famousby Henderson – is water. It happens that water combines in one substance severalkey qualities (thermal, mechanical, chemical) that life exploits and indeed that areindispensable to life as we know it. What are we to make of this? Is it just a luckyfluke that the same stuff that has an anomalous expansion property when it freezes(enabling ice to float) also has superlative solvent properties or unusually highsurface tension and/or efficient tectonic lubrication qualities, for example?Viewed in a multiverse context, we may imagine a world in which, say, themass of the electron is different. This would have a knock-on effect on all theabove properties:Nof them, say. Thus, as the mass changes, these propertiescease to assume biofriendly values. So on the face of it, we may invoke a standardmultiverse/anthropic explanation for why water is biofriendly. But this is a bit of acheat. We still need to explain whyanyvalues for the electron mass exist in whichall Nof the key properties realize their biofriendly valuessimultaneously.Mypointis that the saidNqualities are not independent, but interrelated through physics andchemistry. You can’t change each of them in isolation without changing the others.So we are left with the mystery of whyanyuniverse in the multiverse containsanyfluid that enjoys, in conjunction, all the properties needed for life.Perhaps we can entertain a naturalistic explanation along the following lines.Parameters other than the mass of the electron may affect the properties of water.The mass of the proton and the neutron, hence the masses of hydrogen and oxy-gen, will affect the density and viscosity of water. The fine-structure constant willaffect the strengths of chemical bonds. One could envisage these parameters beingindependently varied. Within the four-dimensional parameter space, one or moreregions may then exist where most of theNkey properties take biofriendly values.Barrow has pointed out (see Chapter8, this volume) that simultaneously scalingthe fine-structure constant and the product of the mass and charge of the elec-tron leaves the non-relativistic Schr ̈odinger equation invariant, implying no changein those properties of water that do not depend on relativistic effects. Therefore,one should envisage a large two-dimensional subspace of the parameter space asbeing biofriendly. Including the nuclear masses, however, breaks the invariance. Aresearch program along these lines – to find out whether other regions exist of thelarger-parameter space in which water possesses appropriate qualities – might beworthwhile.This proposal is predicated on the assumption that one is free to vary the fore-going parameters independently. This may be unwarranted. A future unified theory5See, for example, Barrow and Tipler (1986)."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"6Fitness and the cosmic environment111might well tie together quantities such as the masses of particles and the forces ofinteraction. In some envisaged unification schemes, all such parameters would befixed by the final theory, leaving no freedom to vary them independently, apart froman overall scale factor (Greene,2000). A good way to think about this point is toimagine a multidimensional parameter space, with each axis labeled by the massesof the fundamental particles, the coupling constants, and so forth. Suppose it hasMdimensions, whereMmight be 30 or so. Each dimension will come with an asso-ciated biofriendly range of values. Obviously, in our universe all such biofriendlyintervals intersect in a biofriendlyM-dimensional volume, a region of parameterspace where all life-permitting values occur simultaneously. Now suppose that theparameters are not all independent, but linked by an underlying theory. If the theoryconnects two parameters, it can be represented by a (generally curved) line in thetwo-dimensional subspace of theM-dimensional parameter space. This line hadbetter intersect the biofriendly volume or the theory would be inconsistent with ourexistence. Continuing in this manner, a final theory that contained no free param-eters would be a curve in theM-dimensional space that would pass through thebiofriendly volume. This curve would define a particular multiverse model, beingthe ensemble of universes corresponding to the points on the curve. A differentcurve would define a different multiverse model characterized by a different finaltheory.What would one then make of cosmic biofriendliness? One could appeal to themultiverse and anthropic selection to explain why our universe was positioned ata felicitous pointalong the curve, namely, a point that lies within the biofriendlyvolume. But it would still be a matter of some amazement that this curve obliginglyintersected the key (and possibly very small) region of theM-dimensional parameterspace in which all the physical parameters assumed their biofriendly values inconjunction. Note that a different final theory would lead toa different curve, onethat in general wouldnotintersect the biofriendly volume. So we seem to havemerely shifted the problem up one level, changing the question fromWhy thisuniverse?toWhy this multiverse?Unless, of course, it could be demonstrated thatonly one final theory is logically possible (a most unlikely prospect, in my opinion).So, here we have the cosmic equivalent of the Henderson water problem: the happyand amazing conjunction of disparate but individually vital properties manifestedin one system.The project that Henderson began nearly a century ago suggested a deep linkbetween life and the universe. Henderson’s central idea – that the physical universeis intriguingly biofriendly – has endured through the revolutions in cosmology,physics, molecular biology, and astrobiology that followed in the decades afterhis work was published.

I am referringnot to discoveries that are related to very localized regions, such as the detection of200 extrasolar planetary systems (at the time of writing1), but rather to propertiesof the universe at large.In order to set the stage properly for the topics that follow, I would like to start bypresenting four observations with which essentially all astronomers agree. Thesefour observationsdefinethe cosmological context of our universe and form thebasis for any theoretical discussion.1.Ever since the observations of Vesto Slipher in 1912–22 (Slipher,1917) and EdwinHubble (1929), we have known that the spectra of distant galaxies are red shifted.2.Observations with the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) have shown that, to aprecision of better than 10−4, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) isthermal,with a temperature of 2.73 K (Matheret al., 1994).3.Light elements, such as deuterium and helium, have been synthesized in a high-temperature phase in the past (see, for example, Gamow,1946; Alpheret al., 1948;Hoyle and Tayler,1964; Peebles,1966;Wagoneret al., 1967).4.Deep observations, such as the Hubble Deep Field, and the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, haveshown that galaxies in the distant universe look younger. Specifically, they are smaller(see, for example, Rocheet al., 1996; Fergusonet al., 2004), and they have a higherfraction of irregular morphologies (see, for example, Abrahamet al., 1996). This is whatone would expect from a higher rate of interactions and from the “building blocks” oftoday’s galaxies.1See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrasolarplanet.Fitness of the Cosmos for Life: Biochemistry and Fine-Tuning,ed. J. D. Barrowet al.Published by Cambridge University Press.C\u0001Cambridge University Press 2007.114"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"7 The interconnections between cosmology and life115When the above four basic observational facts are combined and consideredtogether, there is no escape from the conclusion that our universe isexpandingand cooling. This conclusion is entirelyconsistentwith the Hot Big Bang model.Sometimes, we hear the stronger statement that these observations “prove” thatthere was a Hot Big Bang. However, the scientific method does not truly produce“proofs” in the mathematical sense.During the past decade, deep and/or special-purpose observations with a varietyof ground-based and space-based observatories have advanced our understandingof the history of the universe far beyond the mere theory that a Big Bang occurred(see, for example, the determination of cosmological parameters by the WilkinsonMicrowave Anisotropy Probe [WMAP]) (Spergelet al., 2003). In particular, inspite of uncertainties that still exist, remarkable progress has been achieved in theunderstanding of cosmic star-formation history.By using different observational tracers (e.g. the UV luminosity density) of starformation in high-redshift galaxies, tentative plots for the star formation rate (SFR)as a function of redshift have been produced (see, for example, Lillyet al., 1996;Madauet al., 1996; Steidelet al., 1999; Giavaliscoet al., 2004; Stanwayet al.,2003). There is little doubt that the SFR rises from the present to aboutz≈1. Whathappens in the redshift rangez≈1–6 is still somewhat controversial. Whereas somestudies suggest that the SFR reaches a peak atz≈1–2 and then declines slightlytoward higher redshifts (see, for example, Steidelet al., 1999)ormaybe even morethan slightly (Stanwayet al., 2003)orstays fairly flat up toz≈5 (see, for example,Calzetti and Heckman,1999; Peiet al., 1999), others claim, more speculatively, thatthe SFR continues to rise toz≈8 (Lanzettaet al., 2002). The last claim is based onthe suggestion that previous studies had failed to account for the dimming effectsof surface brightness, but it is not clear whether such a claim can be substantiated(see, for example, Giavaliscoet al., 2004). For my present purposes, however, itis sufficient that the history of theglobalSFR is on the verge of being determined(if it has not been determined already). A knowledge of the SFR as a function ofredshift allows for meaningful constraints to be placed on the global emergence ofcarbon-based life for the first time.Carbon-based life in the universeThe main contributors of carbon to the interstellar medium are intermediate-mass(1–8M\b) stars (see, for example, Wood,1981;Yungelsonet al., 1993;Timmeset al., 1995) through the asymptotic giant branch and planetary nebulae phases.Aknowledge of the cosmic SFR history, together with a knowledge of the initialstellar mass function (presently still uncertain for high redshift), therefore allowsfor an approximate calculation of the rate of carbon production as a function of"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"116Mario Livioredshift (see, for example, Livio,1999). For a peaked SFR, of the type obtainedby Madauet al.(1996), for instance, the peak in the carbon production rate issomewhat delayed (by\u00011 billion years) with respect to the SFR peak. The declinein the carbon production rate is also shallower forz\u00011 (than the decline in theSFR) because of the buildup of a stellar reservoir in the earlier epochs.Assuming a “principle of mediocrity,” one would expect the emergence ofmostcarbon-based life in the universe to be perhaps not too far from the peak in thecarbon production rate – aroundz≈1 (for a peak in the SFR atz≈1–2; otherconsiderations, related to the production of radioactive elements, lead to similarconclusions [see, for example, Hogan,2000]). As the timescale required to developintelligent civilizations may be within a factor of 2 of the lifetime of F5 to mid-Kstars (the ones possessing continuously habitable zones; see Kastinget al.[1993]and further discussion below), it can be expected that intelligent civilizations haveemerged when the universe was\u00020 Gyr old. A younger emergence age may beobtained if the SFR does not decline at redshifts 1.2\u0001z\u00018. The fact that statementsabout the time of emergence of life in the universe can even be made attests to theimmense progress in observational cosmology.Carbon features in most anthropic arguments. In particular, it is often argued thatthe existence of an excited state of the carbon nucleus (the 0+2state) is a manifestationof fine-tuning of the constants of nature, which allowed for the appearance ofcarbon-based life.Carbon is formed through the triple-αprocess in two steps. First, twoαparticlesform the unstable (lifetimec.10−16s)8Be. Second, a thirdαparticle is capturedvia8Be(α,γ)12C. Hoyle argued that, in order for the 3αreaction to proceed at arate sufficient to produce the observed cosmic carbon, a resonant level must existin12C, a few hundred keV above the8Be+4He threshold; such a level was indeedfound experimentally (Dunbaret al., 1953;Hoyleet al., 1953; Cooket al., 1957).The question of how fine-tuned this level needs to be for the existence of carbon-based life has been the subject of considerable research. The most recent work onthis topic was done by Oberhummer and collaborators (see, for example, Ober-hummeret al., 2000;Cs ́ot ́ oet al., 2001; Schlattlet al., 2004). These authors useda model that treats the12C nucleus as a system of 12 interacting nucleons, with theapproximate resonant reaction rateγ3α=33/2N3α\u00012πh2MαkBT\u00023\u0005γhexp\u0001−εkBT\u0002(7.1)HereMαandNαare the mass and number density ofαparticles, respectively,εis the resonance energy (in the center-of-mass frame),\u0005γis the relative width,and all other symbols have their usual meaning. These authors also introducedsmall variations in the strengths of the nucleon–nucleon interaction and in the"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"7 The interconnections between cosmology and life117fine-structure constant (affectingεand\u0005γ) and calculated stellar models using themodified rates. In their initial work, Oberhummeret al.(2000) concluded that achange of more than 0.5% in the strength of the strong interaction or more than4% in the strength of the electromagnetic interaction would result in essentially noproduction of carbon or oxygen (considering the12C(α,γ)16O and16O(α,γ)20Nereactions) in any star. More specifically, a decrease in the strong-interaction strengthby 0.5%, coupled with an increase in the fine-structure constant by 4%, resulted ina decrease in the carbon production by a factor of a few tens in 20M\bstars and by afactor ofc.100 in 1.3M\bstars. Taken at face value, this seemed to support anthropicclaims for the extreme fine-tuning necessary for the emergence of carbon-basedlife.Earlier calculations by Livioet al.(1989) indicated less impressive fine-tuning.They showed that shifting (artificially) the energy of the carbon resonant state by upto 0.06 MeV does not result in a significant reduction in the production of carbon.As this 0.06 MeV should be compared with thedifferencebetween the resonanceenergy in12Cand the 3αthreshold (calculated with the basic nucleon–nucleoninteraction), it was not obvious that a particularly fantastic fine-tuning was required.Most recently, however, Schlattlet al.(2004) reinvestigated the dependence ofcarbon and oxygen production in stars on the 3αrate. These authors found thatfollowing the entire stellar evolution was crucial. They concluded that in massivestars C and O production strongly depends on the initial mass. In intermediate- andlow-mass stars, Schlattlet al. found that the high carbon production during He shellflashes leads to alowersensitivity of the C and O production to the 3αrate thaninferred by Oberhummeret al.(2000). Schlattlet al.(2004) concluded by sayingthat “fine-tuning with respect to the obtained carbon and oxygen abundance is morecomplicated and far less spectacular” than that found by Oberhummeret al.(2000).The nature of dark energyIn 1998, two teams of astronomers, working independently, presented evidencethat the expansion of the universe is accelerating (Riesset al., 1998; Perlmutteret al., 1999). The evidence was based primarily on the unexpected faintness (byc.0.25 mag) of distant (z≈0.5) Type Ia supernovas compared with their expectedbrightness in a universe decelerating under its own gravity. The results favoredvalues of\u0001m≈0.3 and\u0001\u0007≈0.7 for matter and “dark energy” density parameters,respectively. Subsequent observations of the supernova SN 1997ff, at the redshiftofz\t1.7, strengthened the conclusion of an accelerating universe (Riesset al.,2001). This supernova appearedbrighterrelative to SNe in a coasting universe, asexpected from the fact that atz≈1.7 a universe with\u0001m≈0.3 and\u0001\u0007≈0.7 wouldstill be in its decelerating phase. The observations of SN 1997ff do not support any"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"118Mario Livioalternative interpretation (such as dust extinction or evolutionary effects) in whichsupernovas are expected to dim monotonically with redshift. Measurements of thepower spectrum of the CMB (see, for example, Abroeet al., 2002;deBernardiset al., 2002; Netterfieldet al., 2002; and, most recently, the WMAP results, Bennettet al., 2003) provide strong evidence for flatness (\u0001m+\u0001\u0007=1). When combinedwith estimates of\u0001mbased on mass-to-light ratios, X-ray temperatures of intra-cluster gas, and dynamics of clusters (all of which give\u0001m\u00010.3; see, for example,Strauss and Willick,1995; Carlberget al., 1996; Bahcallet al., 2000), again a valueof\u0001\u0007≈0.7 is obtained.Arguably, the two greatest puzzles that physics faces today are:1.What is the nature of dark energy, and why is its density,ρ\u0007,sosmall, but not zero? (Or,why does the vacuum energy gravitate so little?)2.Whynow? Namely, why do we find at present that\u0001\u0007≈\u0001m?The first question reflects the fact that taking graviton energies up to the Planckscale,MP,would produce a dark-energy density roughly of the order ofρ\u0007≈M4P≈(1018GeV)4(7.2)which misses the observed one,ρ\u0007≈(10−3eV)4,bymore than 120 orders ofmagnitude. Even if the energy density in fluctuations in the gravitational field istaken only up to the supersymmetry-breaking scale,MSUSY,westill miss the mark byafactor of 60 orders of magnitude becauseρ\u0007≈M4SUSY≈(1 TeV)4. Interestingly,a scaleM\u0007≈(MSUSY/MP)MSUSYproduces the right order of magnitude. However,although a few attempts in this direction have been made (see, for example, Arkani-Hamedet al., 2000), no satisfactory model that naturally produces this scale hasbeen developed.The second question is related to the anti-Copernican fact that\u0001\u0007may be asso-ciated with a cosmological constant, while\u0001mdeclines continuously (and, in anycase,ρ\u0007may be expected to have a time behavior different from that ofρm), andyet the first time that we are able to measure both reliably we find that they are ofthe same order of magnitude.The attempts to solve these problems fall into three general categories:1.The behavior of “quintessence” fields2.Alternative theories of gravity3.Anthropic considerationsAttempts of the first type have concentrated in particular on “tracker” solutions(see, for example, Zlatevet al., 1998; Albrecht and Skordis,2002)inwhich thesmallness of\u0001\u0007is a direct consequence of the universe’s old age.

The energy density of the scalarfield is given byρφ=12 ̇φ2+V(φ)(7.4)and that of matter and radiation,ρm,by ̇ρm=−3H(ρm+Pm)(7.5)wherePmis the pressure. For a potential of the formV(φ)=φ−αM4+α(7.6)whereα>0 andMis an adjustable constant (MMP), and a field that is initiallymuch smaller than the Planck mass, one obtains a solution in which a transitionoccurs from an earlyρm-dominance to a lateρφ-dominance (with no need to fine-tune the initial conditions). Nevertheless, for the conditionρφ≈ρmto actually besatisfied at present requires (Weinberg,2001) that the parameterMsatisfyM4+α\t(8πG)−1−α/2H20(7.7)which is not easily explicable.In order to overcome this problem, some quintessence models choose potentialsin which the universe has periodically been accelerating in the past (see, for example,Dodelsonet al., 2000)sothat dark energy’s dominance today appears naturally.Avery different approach regards the accelerating expansion not as being pro-pelled by dark energy, but rather as being the result of a modified gravity. For exam-ple, models have been developed (Deffayetet al., 2002)inwhich ordinary particlesare localized on a three-dimensional surface (3-brane) embedded in infinite-volumeextra dimensions to which gravity can spread. The model is constructed in such away that observers on the brane discover Newtonian gravity (four-dimensional) atdistances that are shorter than a crossover scale,rc, which can be of astronomicalsize. In one version, the Friedmann equation is replaced byH2+ka2=\u0003\u0004ρ3M2P+14r2c+e12r2c\u00052(7.8)whereρis the total energy density,ais the scale factor, ande=±1.In this case, the dynamics of gravity are governed by whetherρ/M2Pis larger orsmaller than 1/r2c. Choosingrc≈H−10preserves the usual cosmological results.At large cosmic distances, however, gravity spreads into extra dimensions (the"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"120Mario Livioforce law becomes five-dimensional) and becomes weaker, directly affecting thecosmic expansion. Basically, at late times, the model has a self-accelerating cos-mological branch withH=1/rc(to leading order Equation7.8can be parameter-ized asH2−H/rc\tρ/3M2P). Interestingly, it has recently been suggested thatthe viability of these models can be tested by lunar ranging experiments (Dvaliet al., 2003). I should also note that the early WMAP results indicated an intriguinglack of correlated signal on angular scales greater than 60 degrees (Spergelet al.,2003), reinforcing the low quadrupole seen already in COBE results. One possible,although at this stage very speculative, interpretation of these results is that theysignal the breakdown of conventional gravity on large scales.A third class of proposed solutions to the dark-energy problem relies on anthropicselection effects, and therefore on theexistenceof intelligent life in our universe.The basic premise of this approach is that some of the constants of nature are actuallyrandom variables, whose range of values anda prioriprobabilities are neverthelessdetermined by the laws of physics. The observed Big Bang, in this picture, is simplyone member of an ensemble. It is further assumed that a “principle of mediocrity”applies; namely, we can expect to observe the most probable values (Vilenkin,1995). Using this approach, Garrigaet al.(2000; following the original idea ofWeinberg,1987) were able to show that, when the cosmological constant\u0007is theonly variable parameter, the order of magnitude coincidencet0≈t\u0007≈tG(wheret0is the present time,t\u0007is the time at which\u0001\u0007starts to dominate, andtGis thetime when giant galaxies were assembled) finds a natural explanation (see alsoBludman,2000).Qualitatively, the argument works as follows.In a geometrically flat universe with a cosmological constant, gravitational clus-tering can no longer occur after redshift (1+z\u0007)≈(ρ\u0007/ρm0)1/3(whereρm0isthe present matter density). Therefore, requiring thatρ\u0007does not dominate beforeredshiftzmax,atwhich the earliest galaxies formed, requires (see, for example,Weinberg,1987)ρ\u0007\u0001(1+zmax)3ρm0(7.9)One can expect thea priori(independent of observers) probability distributionP(ρ\u0007)tovary on some characteristic scale,ρ\u0007≈η4, determined by the underlyingphysics. Irrespective of whetherηis determined by the Planck scale (c.1018GeV),the grand unification scale (c.1016GeV) or the electroweak scale (c.102GeV),ρ\u0007exceeds the anthropically allowed range ofρ\u0007(Equation7.9)bysomanyorders of magnitude that it looks reasonable to assume thatP(ρ\u0007)=const,(7.10)"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"7 The interconnections between cosmology and life121over the range of interest. Garriga and Vilenkin (2001) and Weinberg (2001)haveshown that this assumption is satisfied by a broad class of models, even though notautomatically. With a flat distribution, a value ofρ\u0007picked randomly (and whichmay characterize a “pocket” universe) from an interval|ρ\u0007|<ρmax\u0007will, with a highprobability, be on the order ofρmax\u0007. The principle of mediocrity, however, meansthat we should observe a value ofρ\u0007that maximizes the number of galaxies. Thissuggests that we should observe the largest value ofρ\u0007that is still consistent witha substantial fraction of matter having collapsed into galaxies: in other words,t\u0007≈tG,asobserved. Above, I argued that the appearance of carbon-based life maybe associated roughly with the peak in the star formation rate,tSFR. The “presenttime,”t0,isnot much different (in that it takes only a fraction of a stellar lifetime todevelop intelligent life), hencet0≈tSFR. Finally, hierarchical structure-formationmodels suggest that vigorous star formation is closely associated with the formationof galactic-size objects (see, for example, Baughet al., 1998; Fukugitaet al., 1998).Therefore,tG≈tSFR, and we obtaint0≈tG≈t\u0007.Garrigaet al.(2000) further expanded their discussion to treat not just\u0007,butalso the density contrast at recombination,σrec,asarandom variable (see alsoTegmark and Rees,1998). The galaxy formation in this case is spread over amuch wider time interval, and proper account has to be taken of the fact that thecooling of protogalactic clouds collapsing at very late times is too slow for efficientfragmentation and star formation (fragmentation occurs if the cooling timescale isshorter than the collapse timescale,τcool<τgrav). Assuming ana prioriprobabilitydistribution of the formP(σrec)∼σ−αrec(7.11)Garrigaet al. found that “mediocre” observers will detectσrec≈10−4,to≈tG≈t\u0007≈tcb,asobserved,ifα>3 (here the “cooling boundary”tcbis the time afterwhich fragmentation is suppressed).Other anthropic explanations for the value of the cosmological constant and the“why now?” problem have been suggested in the context of maximally extended(N=8) supergravity (Kallosh and Linde,2003; Linde,2003). In particular, theformer authors found that the universe can have a suffciently long lifetime only ifthe scalar field satisfies initially|φ|\u0001MPand if the value of the potentialV(0),which plays the role of the cosmological constant, does not exceed the criticaldensityρ0≈10−120M4P.Personally, I feel that anthropic explanations to the dark-energy problem shouldbe regarded as thelast resort, only after all attempts to find explanations basedon first principles have been exhausted and failed. Nevertheless, the anthropicexplanation may prove to be the correct one, if our understanding of what is truly"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"122Mario Liviofundamentalis lacking. A historical example can help to clarify this last statement.Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) was obsessed by the following two questions:1.Why were there precisely six planets? (Only Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, andSaturn were known at his time.)2.What was it that determined that the planetary orbits would be spaced as they are?The first thing to realize is that these “why” and “what” questions were a noveltyin the astronomical vocabulary. Astronomers before Kepler were usually satisfiedwith simply recording the observed positions of the planets; Kepler was seeking atheoretical explanation. Kepler finally came up with preposterously fantastic (andabsolutely wrong) answers to his two questions inMysterium cosmographicum,published in 1597. He suggested that the reason for there being six planets is thatthere are precisely five Platonic solids. Taken as boundaries (with an outer spher-ical boundary corresponding to the fixed stars), the solids create six spacings. Bychoosing a particular order for the solids to be embedded in one another, withearth separating the solids that can stand upright (cube, tetrahedron, and dodecahe-dron) from those that “float” (octahedron and icosahedron), Kepler claimed to haveexplained the sizes of the orbits as well (the spacings agreed with observations towithin 10%).Today, we recognize themainproblem with Kepler’s model: Kepler did notunderstand that neither the number of planets nor their spacings arefundamentalquantities that need to have an explanation from first principles. Rather, both arethe result of historical accidents in the solar protoplanetary disk. Still, it is perfectlylegitimate to give an anthropic “explanation” for earth’s orbital radius. If that orbitwere not in the continuously habitable zone around the sun (Kastinget al., 1993),we would not be here to ask the question.It is difficult to admit it, but our current model for the composition of theuniverse –c.74% dark energy,c.22% cold dark matter,c.4% baryonic mat-ter, and maybec.0.5% neutrinos – appears no less preposterous than Kepler’smodel. Although some version of string (orM-) theories may eventually provide afirst-principles explanation for all of these values, it is also possible, in my opinion,that these individual values are in fact not fundamental, but accidental. Maybe theonly fundamental property is the fact thatall the energy densities add up to pro-duce a geometrically flat universe,aspredicted by inflation (Guth,1981;Hawking,1982; Steinhardt and Turner,1984) and confirmed by WMAP (Spergelet al., 2003).Clearly, for any anthropic explanation of the value of\u0001\u0007to be meaningful at all,even in principle, one requires the existence of a large ensemble of universes,with different values of\u0001\u0007. That this requirement may actually be fulfilled isprecisely one of the consequences of the concept of “eternal inflation” (Stein-hardt,1983;Vilenkin,1983; Linde,1986; Goncharovet al., 1987; Linde,2003)."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"7 The interconnections between cosmology and life123In most inflationary models, the timescale associated with the expansion is muchshorter than the decay timescale of the false-vacuum phase,TexpTdec. Conse-quently, the emergence of a fractal structure of “pocket universes” surrounded byfalse-vacuum material is almost inevitable (Garcia-Bellido and Linde,1995; Guth,2001; for a different view, see, for example, Bucheret al., 1995;Turok,2001).Thisensemble of pocket universes may serve as the basis on which anthropic argu-mentation can be constructed (even though the definition of probabilities on thisinfinite set is non-trivial; see, for example, Lindeet al., 1995;Vilenkin,1998).Furthermore, the construction of de Sitter vacua of supergravity in string theoryhas shown that the number of possible solutions is extraordinarily large (Kachruet al., 2003), again indicating the possible existence of an ensemble of universes(a “landscape”).Is the fine-structure constant varying with time?Another recent finding, which,if confirmed, may have implications for the emer-gence of life in the universe, is that of the cosmological evolution of the fine-structureconstantα≡e2/hc(Webbet al., 1999, 2001, and references therein). Needless tosay, life as we know it places significant anthropic constraints on the range of valuesallowed forα.For example, the requirement that the lifetime of the proton would belonger than the main-sequence lifetime of stars results in an upper boundα\u00011/80(Ellis and Nanopoulos,1981; Barrowet al., 2002a). The claimed detection of timevariability was based on shifts in the rest wavelengths of redshifted UV resonancetransitions observed in quasar absorption systems. Basically, the dependence ofobserved wave number at redshiftz,ωz,onαcan be expressed asωz=ω0+a1ω1+a2ω2(7.12)wherea1anda2represent relativistic corrections for particular atomic masses andelectron configurations, andω1=\u0001αzα0\u00022−1(7.13)ω2=\u0001αzα0\u00024−1(7.14)Hereα0andαzrepresent the present-day and redshiftzvalues ofα, respectively.

Their data suggested a 4σdeviationαα=(−0.72±0.18)×10−5(7.15)over the redshift range 1.5\u0001z\u00013.5 (whereα/α=αz−α0α0). More recently, Murphyet al.(2003) analyzed a total of 128 absorption systems over the redshift range0.2<z<3.7 and obtainedαα=(−0.574±0.102)×10−5(7.16)It should be noted, however, that the data are consistent withnovariation forz\u00011, in agreement with many previous studies (see, for example, Bahcallet al., 1967;Wolfeet al.,1976; Cowie and Songaila,1995).Murphyet al.(2001, 2003) conducted a comprehensive search for system-atic effects that could potentially be responsible for the result (e.g. laboratorywavelength errors, isotopic abundance effects, heliocentric corrections during thequasar integration, line blending, and atmospheric dispersion). Although theyconcluded that isotopic abundance evolution and atmospheric dispersion couldhave an effect, this was in the direction of actually amplifying the variation inα(toα/α=(−1.19±0.17)×10−5). The most recent results of Webbet al. arenot inconsistent with limits onαfrom the Oklo natural uranium fission reactor(which was active 1.8×109years ago, corresponding toz≈0.1) and with con-straints from experimental tests of the equivalence principle. The former suggestsα/α\t(−0.4±1.4)×10−8(Fujiiet al., 2000), and the latterallowsfor a varia-tion of the magnitude observed in the context of a general dynamical theory relatingvariations ofαto the electromagnetic fraction of the mass density in the universe(Bekenstein,1982;Livio and Stiavelli,1998).Before going any farther, I would like to note that what is desperately neededright now is an independent confirmation (or refutation) of the results of Webbet al.byother groups, through both additional (and preferably different) obser-vations and independent analysis of the data. In this respect, it is important torealize that the reliability of the SNe Ia results (concerning the accelerating uni-verse) was enormously enhanced by the fact that two separate teams (the SupernovaCosmology Project and the High-zSupernova Team) reached the same conclusionindependently, using different samples and different data analysis techniques. Afirst small step in the direction of testing the variableαresult came from measure-ments of the CMB. A likelihood analysis of BOOMERanG and MAXIMA data,allowing for the possibility of a time-varyingα(which, in turn, affects the recom-bination time), found that in general the data may prefer a smallerαin the past(although the conclusion is not free of degeneracies) (Avelinoet al., 2000; Battyeet al., 2001). A second, much more important step came through an extensive"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"7 The interconnections between cosmology and life125analysis using the nebular emission lines of [O III]λλ4959, 5007Å(Bahcallet al., 2004). Bahcallet al. foundα/α=(−2±1.2)×10−4(corresponding to\u0006\u0006α−1dα/dt\u0006\u0006<10−13yr−1, which they consider to be a null result, given the preci-sion of their method) for quasars in the redshift range 0.16<z<0.8.Although this result is not formally inconsistent with the variation claimed byWebbet al., the careful analysis of Bahcallet al. has cast some serious doubts on theability of the “many-multiplet” method employed by Webb and his collaboratorsto actually reach the accuracy required to measure fractional variations inαat the10−5level. For example, Bahcallet al.have shown that, to achieve that precision,one needs to assume that the velocity profiles of different ions in different cloudsare essentially the same to within 1 km s−1.Inthe most recent work, Chandet al.(2004) observed 23 Mg II systems toward 18 QSOs in the redshift range 0.4\u0001z\u00012.3. The weighted mean value of variation inαthey obtained was considerablysmaller than that claimed by Murphyet al.(2003). Chandet al. foundα/α=(−0.06±0.06)×10−5. Furthermore, in a separate study, Ashenfelteret al.(2004)have shown that the synthesis of25,26Mg in low-metallicity asymptotic giant-branchstars produces isotopic ratios that could explain the data fromz<1.8 withoutinvoking variations in the fine structure constant. However, even for extremely lowmetallicity (inconsistent with that observed in the 0.4\u0001z\u00012 redshift range), theexpected effect produced by the different isotopic ratios is smaller than the oneclaimed by Murphyet al.(2003). Clearly, much more work on this topic is needed.I should also note right away that, in order not to be in conflict with the yield of4He,|α/α|cannot exceedc.2×10−2at the time of nucleosynthesis (see, forexample, Bergstr ̈omet al., 1999).On the theoretical side, simple cosmological models with a varying fine structureconstant have now been developed (see, for example, Sandviket al., 2002; Barrowet al., 2002b). They share some properties with Kaluza–Klein-type models in whichαvaries at the same rate as the extra dimensions of space (see, for example, Damourand Polyakov,1994) and with varying-speed-of-light theories (see, for example,Albrecht and Magueijo,1999; Barrow and Magueijo,2000).The general equations describing a geometrically flat, homogeneous, isotropic,variable-αuniverse (Bekenstein,1982;Livio and Stiavelli,1998; Sandviket al.,2002) are the Friedmann equation (withG=c≡1)\u0001 ̇aa\u00022=8π3[ρm(1+|ζm|e−2ψ)+ρre−2ψ+ρψ+ρ\u0007](7.17)the evolution of the scalar field varyingα(α=exp(2ψ)e20/hc) ̈ψ+3Hψ=−2ωe−2ψζmρm(7.18)"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"126Mario Livioand the conservation equations for matter and radiation ̇ρm+3Hρm=0(7.19) ̇ρr+4Hρr=2ψρr(7.20)Here,ρm,ρr,ρψ,ρ\u0007are the densities of matter, radiation, scalar field\u0007ω2ψ2\b, andvacuum, respectively;a(t)isthe scale factor (H≡ ̇a/a);ω=hc/l2is the couplingconstant of the dynamic Langrangian (lis a length scale of the theory); andξmisa dimensionless parameter that represents the fraction of mass in Coulomb energyof an average nucleon compared with the free proton mass.Equations7.17–7.20were solved numerically by Sandviket al.(2002) andBarrowet al.(2002b), assuming a negative value of the parameterξm/ω, and theresults are interesting both from a purely cosmological point of view and fromthe perspective of the emergence of life. First, the results are consistent both withthe claims of a varyingαof Webbet al.(2001) (which, as I noted, badly need furtherconfirmation) and with the more secure, by now, observations of an acceleratinguniverse (Riesset al., 1998; Perlmutteret al., 1999; Spergelet al., 2003), whilecomplying with the geological and nucleosynthetic constraints. Second, Barrowet al. (2002a,b) find thatαremains almost constant in the radiation-dominated eraand experiences a small logarithmic time increase during the matter-dominated era,but approaches a constant value again in the\u0007-dominated era. This behavior hasinteresting anthropic consequences. The existence of a non-zero vacuum-energycontribution is nowrequiredin this picture to dynamically stabilize the fine struc-ture constant. In a universe with zero\u0007,αwould continue to grow in the matter-dominated era to values that would make the emergence of life impossible (Barrowet al., 2002a,b).Clearly, the viability of all of the speculative ideas above relies at this point onthe confirmation or refutation of time-varying constants of nature. Most recently,Barrow (2005) has shown that the isotropy of the microwave background imposesvery stringent bounds on spatial variations of physical constants.How rare is extraterrestrial intelligent life?With the discovery ofc.200 massive extrasolar planets (see, for example, Mayorand Queloz,1995; Marcy and Butler,1996, 2000), the question of the potentialexistence of extraterrestrial, galactic, intelligent life has certainly become moreintriguing than ever. This topic has attracted much attention and generated manyspeculative (by necessity) probability estimates. Nevertheless, in a quite remark-able paper, Carter (1983) concluded on the basis of the near-equality between thelifetime of the sun,t\b, and the timescale of biological evolution on earth,t\u0013, thatextraterrestrial intelligent civilizations are exceedingly rare in the galaxy. Most"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"7 The interconnections between cosmology and life127significantly, Carter’s conclusion is supposed to hold even if the conditions optimalfor the emergence of life are relatively common.Let me reproduce here, very briefly, Carter’s argument. The basic, and verycrucial, assumption on which the argument is based is that the lifetime of a star,t∗,and the timescale of biological evolution on a planet around that star,t\u0013(taken here,for definiteness, to be the timescale for the appearance of complex land life) areapriori entirely independent.Inother words, the assumption is that land life appearsat somerandomtime with respect to the main-sequence lifetime of the star. Underthis assumption, one expects that generally one of the two relationst\u0013\ft∗andt\u0013t∗applies (the set wheret\u0013≈t∗is of negligible measure for two independentquantities). Let us examine each one of these possibilities. Ifgenerally t\u0013t∗,itisvery difficult to understand why, in the first system found to contain complex landlife – the earth–sun system – the two timescales are nearly equal,t\u0013≈t∗. If, onthe other hand,generally t\u0013\ft∗, then clearly the first system we find must exhibitt\u0013≈t∗(because fort\u0013\ft∗complex land life would not have developed). Therefore,one has to conclude thattypically t\u0013\ft∗, and that consequently, complex land lifewill generally not develop; earth is an extremely rare exception.Carter’s argument is quite powerful and not easily refutable. Its basic assumption(the independence oft\u0013andt∗) appears on the face of it to be solid becauset∗isdetermined primarily by nuclear burning reactions, whereast\u0013is determined bybiochemical reactions and the evolution of species. Nevertheless, the fact that thestar is the main energy source for biological evolution (light energy exceeds theother sources by 2–3 orders of magnitude; see, for example, Deamer,1997) alreadyimplies that the two quantities are not completely independent.Let me first take a purely mathematical approach and examine what it would takefor the conditiont\u0013≈t∗to be satisfied in the earth–sun systemwithoutimplyingthat extraterrestrial intelligent life is extremely rare.

The toy model was based on the assumption that the appearanceof land life has to await the buildup of a sufficient layer of protective ozone (Berknerand Marshall,1965; Hart,1978) and on the fact that oxygen in a planet’s atmosphereis released in the first phase from the dissociation of water (Hart,1978;Levineet al., 1979). Given that the duration of this phase is inversely proportional tothe intensity of radiation in the 1000–2000Årange, a relation betweent\u0013andt∗can be established. In fact, a simple calculation gavet\u0013/t∗\t0.4(t∗/t\b)1.7(7.23)precisely the type of monotonic relation needed.I should be the first to point out that the toy model above is nothing more thanthat: a toy model. It does point out, however, that, at the very least, establishing alink between the biochemical and astrophysical timescales may not be impossible.Clearly, the emergence of complex life on earth required many factors operatingtogether. These include processes that appear entirely accidental, such as the stabi-lization of the earth’s tilt against chaotic evolution by the moon (see, for example,Laskaret al., 1993). Nevertheless, we should not be so arrogant as to concludeeverything from the one example we know. The discovery of many “hot Jupiters”(giant planets with orbital radii\u00010.05 AU) has already demonstrated that the solarsystem may not be typical. In particular, Jupiter is a significant outlier (at the 2.3σlevel) in the periastron distribution of all the extrasolar planets (Beeret al., 2004).Although this could represent merely a selection effect (we should know within5–10 years), the possibility exists that most of the observed extrasolar planetarysystems have been formed in a way rather different from our own. We should nonethe less keep an open mind to the possibility that biological complexity may findother paths to emerge, making various “accidents,” coincidences, and fine-tuningunnecessary. In any case, the final scientific assessment on life in the universe willprobably come from biologists and observers – not from speculating theorists likemyself.AcknowledgmentsThis work has been supported by Grant 938-COS191 from the John TempletonFoundation.

BarrowIntroductionIn recent years, there has been great interest among some particle physicists andastronomers in assessing the dependence of the gross structure of the universe onthe values of its defining constants of nature. This agenda has been partly motivatedby the recognition that many of the most important structures in the universe, andits most crucial evolutionary pathways over billions of years of cosmic history,are surprisingly sensitive to the values of some of those constants. Since we lackany fundamental understanding of why any of the constants of nature take thevalues that they do, this state of affairs appears surprisingly fortuitous. It provokescosmologists to consider our observed universe in the context of a wider ensembleof possible universes in which the laws of nature remain the same but the constantsof nature, or the boundary conditions that specify the overall expansion dynamicsof the universe, are allowed to change. In effect, a type of “stability” analysis isperformed to ascertain how large such changes in the structure of the universe andits defining constants could be and still give rise to a recognizable universe.These considerations have attracted renewed attention with the realization thatour universe may have a significant non-uniform structure in space, in whichthe values of many of the quantities that we dub “constants” may in fact bevariable values of spacetime-dependent fields. Their values in their ground state willbe uniquely defined only if the ground state, or vacuum state, of the universe isunique. However, from what we know of string theories at present, it appears thatthere is a vast level of non-uniqueness about the vacuum state. String theory offersavast landscape of different low-energy worlds in which the gallery of fundamentalforces – their identities, multiplicity, and strengths – can fall out in many differentways. Some of these will allow complexity to develop in the universe, but most willFitness of the Cosmos for Life: Biochemistry and Fine-Tuning,ed. J. D.

As a result, it is of considerable interest to study the extent to which observersare possible in different vacua [1, 2], whether the fact that we observe three largedimensions of space to exist in the universe is true everywhere, and whether thedimensionality of space has a dynamical or random origin. Thus the different “uni-verses” either can be realized at different places in a very large, or spatially infinite,universe or can be different outcomes of a spontaneous symmetry-breaking processin the quantum gravitational era of the universe’s evolution.In assessing the likelihood that our universe arose from one of these stringtheoretic scenarios, we have to ask what the probability is of our type of universearising from the subset of all possibilities that can permit living complexity todevelop, not merely the unconditioned probability of our universe arising as asolution of the theory. Very similar considerations also arise in the context of thechaotic and eternal inflationary universe scenarios [3]. There, the final state of thefields that give rise to inflation can determine the values of some of the constantsof nature and the low-energy symmetry group that determines the forces of nature.This final state can be different in different inflated regions of the universe, givingrise to an effective spatial variation of the “constants.” Again, the challenge is tofind a rigorous method to compute the probability distribution of outcomes andto determine the likelihood of “our” universe arising, as well as the probability of“our” universe arising in the subset of life-supporting universes. Taking a modifiedCopernican perspective, we ask whether we are typical among those universes inwhich intelligent life could evolve and persist.These investigations in cosmology have been discussed in some detail else-where [4]. They have refocused attention on the sensitive aspects of the universeas a life-supporting environment. This type of examination of the sensitivity ofthe universe to the numerical values of its dimensionless constants and boundaryconditions is very familiar to astrophysicists, but it appears to be almost unknownto chemists. Very few analyses of the sensitivity of life-supporting aspects of chem-istry have been given by chemists in modern times (see, for example, [5]), althoughsome extensive analyses have been made by physicists [6] under the title of the“anthropic principles.” In addition, wider considerations of how local geophysi-cal and astronomical “coincidences” have been exploited by the evolution of lifeare given by Ward and Brownlee under the banner of the “rare Earth hypothesis”[7] and by Gonzalez and Richards [8]inarecent survey that encompasses manyaspects of solar system structure and geomorphology. In this chapter, and many ofthe others in this volume, we investigate ways in which crucial chemical and bio-chemical structures and mechanisms exhibit sensitivity to constants of nature andambient conditions. We are interested in those pathways that are important for theorigin and persistence of life. In addition to understanding the sensitivity of knownpathways, we hope that these studies will provoke consideration of alternative"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"134John D. Barrowbiochemistries or the ways in which standard chemistry might be changed byunusual environments. For example, we have long appreciated that atomic andmolecular structure is significantly changed in the presence of very strong mag-netic fields and are beginning to appreciate that the unique properties of water canbe significantly changed in thin films. In both these cases, atomic structures behaveas though the world possessed just two accessible dimensions of space.Webegin with a historical summary of previous investigations of the special fea-tures of chemical structure by natural theologians of the eighteenth and nineteenthcenturies, together with the important contributions of Henderson early in the twen-tieth century. We then describe some of the results of searching for fine-tunings inphysics and astronomy before turning to introduce some points of possible currentinterest to chemists and biochemists.Fine-tuning in historyHendersonLawrence J. Henderson, professor of chemistry at Harvard, wrote two books onthe fitness of chemical elements, molecules, and compounds for the existence andfunctioning of the phenomenon that we call “life.” The first,The Fitness of the Envi-ronment(1913) [9], is the inspiration for this volume. The other, less well knownvolume, entitledThe Order of Nature(1917) [10], contains a summary of the argu-ments put forward inFitness, together with a wider philosophical reflection on theconclusions to be drawn from them. The discussions are remarkable in that theypredate quantum mechanics; however, they were by no means the first discussionsof the fitness of chemistry for life. See, for instance, Prout’s famous BridgewaterTreatise,Chemistry, Meteorology and the Function of Digestion(1834) [11]. OrseeReligion and Chemistry(1880) by Josiah Cooke, a professor of chemistry andmineralogy at Harvard [12]. Cooke’s work provoked further detailed discussionsof the life-supporting properties of water, carbonic acid, C, N, and O by Chad-bourne in hisLectures on Natural Theology(1870) [13]. And these properties weremost magisterially addressed by Alfred Russel Wallace in his bookMan’s Placein the Universe(1903) [14]. Henderson’s studies were the broadest and deepest,not superseded until Needham’sOrder and Lifewas published in 1936 [15]. Yet,despite their clear and compelling presentation, Henderson’s books attracted littleinternational attention at the time. J. S. Haldane briefly reviewed Henderson’s sec-ond book forNature[16], but it was only his son J. B. S. Haldane who graspedthe significance of what Henderson was arguing and followed up with a number ofshort papers of his own about the reasons for the form of the laws of nature andthe role of cosmological evolution in driving the pace of evolutionary change [17]."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"8 Chemistry and sensitivity135They probably appeared a little too speculative because they exploited non-standardcosmological models, with two timescales, advocated at the time by E. A. Milne.Henderson’s analysis of the wonderful appropriateness of hydrogen, oxygen,and carbon for the roles they play in biochemistry can be summarized by his claimthat [9]No other element or group of elements possesses properties which on any account can becompared with these. All such are deficient at many points, both qualitatively or quanti-tatively. . . . The unique properties of water, carbonic acid, and the three elements con-stitute, among the properties of matter, the fittest ensemble of characteristics for durablemechanism.Henderson was well aware that he was following in the footsteps of those whohad based an Argument from Design for the existence of God on the apparentfine-tuning of nature’s structures and the forms of her laws. He even quotes fromWilliam Whewell’s Bridgewater Treatise [18].One suspects that the lack of contemporary interest in Henderson’s work mighthave been because such ideas were closely associated with the teleological designarguments of the past, which had been discredited by the emergence of naturalselection as a better explanation for biological fine-tuning and, to a far lesser extent,by the philosophical objections of Hume (1779) [19] and Kant (c.1790) [20].Henderson’s contributions to this subject were not confined to his books. Thephilosopher Josiah Royce organized a private evening discussion group at Harvardthat included Henderson (and even T. S. Eliot for a while) as a regular participant.During 1913–14, the group’s discussions focused for three months on Hender-son’sFitness of the Environmentand its interpretations for science and philosophy[21, 22].The legacy of design argumentsIt is useful to distinguish two features of fine-tuning that have become confusedby historians. On the one hand, design arguments have typically pointed to thefortuitous “fine-tuning” of differentoutcomesof the laws of nature: the way inwhich living things seemed tailor-made for their environments, or the fortuitousangle of tilt of the earth’s rotation axis. Arguments of this sort were eloquentlysurveyed in William Paley’s much-quotedNatural Theology(1802) [23], althoughit grew out of talks delivered from 1770 onwards. Many discussions of this typeof fine-tuning ofoutcomeshave taken place since ancient times; see [6] for anoverview.However, historians and theologians never seem to read the second half of Paley’sbook, where he turns to another type of argument (which he doesn’t personally"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"136John D. Barrowlike so much because it is more removed from observation and less amenable toreasoning by analogy, which Paley especially liked) based on the fortuitous structureof thelaws and constantsof nature: the consequences of the inverse-square lawof gravity or the strength of the gravitational force. Here Paley was greatly helpedwith the astronomical details by his friend John Brinkley, who was both Bishop ofCloyne in Cork, and Astronomer Royal for Ireland and Professor of Astronomy atTrinity College, Dublin. Fine-tuning arguments of this sort, based on the form ofthe laws of nature rather than their outcomes, began with Newton and appear firstin print in Richard Bentley’sBoyle Lectures on Natural Theology[24] for which hewas strongly “coached” by Newton himself (this was the motivation for Newton’sfamous four “Letters to Bentley” in 1691 [25], although they were not publisheduntil 1756).Design Arguments based on laws and invariants of nature were completely unaf-fected by natural selection, but few leading scientists appreciated the distinction. Anotable exception was James Clerk Maxwell, who in 1873 emphasized the fact that“molecules” (what we would now call “atoms,” in fact) were populations of identicalparticles whose properties were not acted on by natural selection, but that deter-mined whether life could exist. Henderson was greatly influenced by Maxwell’sideas and quotes from him on many occasions. In fact, one of Maxwell’s remarkableessays on the subject is reproduced in its entirety as an appendix to theOrder ofNature[10]. This essay was a talk on “free will” delivered to the Apostles’ conver-sazione group in Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1873, and also provides the firstidentification of the dynamical phenomenon that we now call “chaos” along witha discussion of its implications for determinism.Fine-tuning in physics and cosmologyMotivationsThe modern interest in fine-tuning exists primarily in particle physics, astro-physics, and cosmology, and its examples are frequently gathered together underthe umbrella of “anthropic arguments” [6]. Cosmologists have been interested in theways in which the observed values of dimensionless constants of nature are relatedto the ranges of values that permit the evolution of “life” or complexity, as we knowit. This program has a variety of motivations, although its most interesting resultsgenerally arise as by-products of other investigations. In particular, it aims to:(a)Understand which features of the universe and its constants are necessary conditionsfor the existence of complexity, chemistry, and life. As a by-product, we might con-sider whether alternative non-carbon-based biochemistries or different life-supportingenvironments to those found on earth might be possible."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"8 Chemistry and sensitivity137(b)Determine whether radical new theories to understand coincidences between the valuesof different dimensionless constants of nature are warranted. Historically, Dicke [26]was the first to show that the “large number coincidences” of cosmology were necessaryfor observers (like ourselves) who rely on hydrogen-burning stars and do not require atime-variation inG,asDirac had proposed in 1937 [27].(c)Identify those aspects of the physical universe’s structure that depend most sensitivelyon the actual values of fundamental constants and to discover whether these sensitivitiesoffer new observational bounds on the possible time or space variation of the supposed“constants of nature” [4].(d)Discover how many (if any) of the underlying constants of nature are fixed by the math-ematical structure of the Theory of Everything and how many remain to be determinedquasi-randomly by physical processes during the history of the universe.Other worldsThe idea of counter-factual alternative “universes” or “many worlds” with differ-ent values of the constants of nature are considered in different contexts. Thesescenarios are the most common:(a)Many worlds, in which all possible permutations and combinations of the constantsof nature, laws, dimensions, and so forth, are considered. This ensemble of possibleother worlds might be metaphysical, as in Leibniz’ “all possible worlds,” which wasthe motivation for Maupertuis’s introduction of Least Action Principles in mechanics[6]inorder to make mathematically precise what was meant by “possible worlds”and by “best world”: the other worlds were the paths of non-minimal action, and thebest world was the one whose dynamics followed the paths of least action! Or theensemble might be physical (as might arise in a single spatially infinite universe).Some commentators see this as a way of avoiding any idea of special anthropocentricdesign in the structure of the universe because in an exhaustively random ensemble ofpossibilities a subset will necessarily exist that permits life (because we know one casecertainly exists!), and we will necessarily be a member of it [28, 29]. No fine-tuning isrequired.(b)Scenarios such as the chaotic or eternal inflationary universe, in which different quanti-ties that we call “constants of nature” fall out differently in different parts of the universeas a result of symmetry-breaking or other random processes of quantum origin. It maybe possible to determine the probability distribution of these outcomes in a prescribedset of inflationary theories (although this has not yet been calculated in a persuasiveway). We would then be able to evaluate the probability of creating an expanding “hab-itable” domain old enough (≈1010years) and large enough to produce elements heavierthan hydrogen and helium by stellar nucleosynthesis.(c)Cosmologies in which some of the constants of nature are assumed to be slowly vary-ing scalar fields, depending on time and position [4]. Such theories provide a fully"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"138John D. Barrowself-consistent context in order to investigate the observational consequences of time-varying constants (as opposed to constants taking different – but still constant –numerical values).(d)In any theory of the very early universe in which intrinsically random processes enter,for example through quantum uncertain initial conditions, quantum gravity [30], orsymmetry-breaking, the ultimate prediction that such a theory makes will be proba-bilistic. In order to test these predictions, it is necessary to know what range of val-ues for the predicted quantities could result in “observers” like ourselves. We need toknow the conditional probability distributions of the predicted parameters given thatobservers can subsequently evolve, not the unconditioned probability distributions. Ifthe peak of the probability distribution for some cosmological property predicted byquantum gravity does not permit any observers to exist, then we should not reject thetheory.(e)“Many worlds” interpretations of quantum mechanics in which the different worldsdefined by measurement assume equal ontological status [31]. This interpretation ofquantum mechanics is the one of choice for researchers in quantum cosmology, where no“observer” of the universe is required, as it is in the so-called Copenhagen Interpretationdeveloped by Bohr.The mystery of constantsThe idea that some traditional constants might be varying has become of great inter-est because of recent observations consistent with variations in the fine-structureconstant at high redshift [32, 33, 34]. However, the fact that string theories onlyappear to be consistent with many more dimensions of space than three means thatthe true constants of nature are defined in the total number of dimensions (nine orten in current theories). The three dimensions we see are large. Any others mustbe assumed to be imperceptibly small. Our constants arise as shadows of the truehigher-dimensional constants as a result of the unknown process by which the extradimensions stay small while our three (why three?) have grown large. If the extradimensions were to change in any way, then our three-dimensional “constants”would be observed to change at the same rate.In all this work, it is good to remember that although we have made steadyprogress in measuring the constants of nature to ever greater numerical precision,we have no idea at all why any of them take the precise numerical values that theydo. Physicists have never predicted or explained the value of any constant of nature.The most pressing problem in fundamental physics and cosmology at present is tounderstand why one apparent constant of nature – the cosmological constant –exists with a small (≈10−121in inverse Planck lengths), but non-zero, value –that is, sufficient to create the currently observed acceleration in the expansion ofthe universe."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"8 Chemistry and sensitivity139Fine-tuning in stars and atomsWhat depends on the value ofα?Weare interested in those aspects of chemistry and biochemistry with specialsensitivities to the values of the existing constants of nature, or to the local orglobal astronomical environment in which life evolves. The following exampleswill give the flavor of such considerations at a back-of-the-envelope level of detail;more examples can be found, with further detail, in references [35, 36, 37, 38].Some examplesAvariety of constraints are placed on the maximum value of the fine-structureconstant,α=e2/\u0002c≈1/137, that is compatible with the existence of nucleons,nuclei, atoms, and stars under the assumption that the forms of the laws of natureremain the same.(a)In simple grand unified gauge theories, the running of the fine-structure constantwith energy due to vacuum polarization effects leads to an exponential sensitiv-ity of the proton lifetime with respect to the low-energy value ofαwithtpr∼α−2exp[α−1]m−1pr ̄hc−2∼1032yrs. In order that the lifetime be less than the mainsequence lifetime of stars, we havetpr<(Gm−2pr)−1m−1pr ̄hc−2, which implies thatαis bounded above byα<1/80 approximately [39].(b)The stability of nuclei is controlled by the balance between nuclear binding andelectromagnetic surface forces. A nucleus (Z,A) will be stable if, roughly,Z2/A<49(αs/0.1)2(1/137α). In order for carbon (Z=6) to be stable, we requireα<16(α/0.1)2. Detailed investigations of the nucleosynthesis processes in stars haveshown that a change in the value ofαshifts the key resonance-level energies in thecarbon and oxygen nuclei that are needed for the production of a mixture of carbonand oxygen from beryllium plus helium-4 and carbon-12 plus helium-4 reactions instars. This unusual level structure was first noted by Hoyle [40] and has recently beenexplored in some detail by Oberhummeret al.[41]. Some of these upper bounds onαare model-independent in significant ways. However, sharper limits can be found byusing our knowledge of the stability of matter derived from analysis of the Schr ̈odingerequation.(c)The value ofαcontrols atomic stability. Ifαincreases in value, then the innermostBohr orbital contracts, and electrons will eventually fall into the nucleus whenα>Z−1mpr/me. Atoms all become relativistic and unstable to pair production. In order thatthe electromagnetic repulsion between protons does not exceed nuclear strong binding,e2/rn<αmπc2,werequireα<1/20. Lieb [42] has proved that atomic instabilityarises for the relativistic Schr ̈odinger equation atZα=2π. When the many-electron–many-nucleus problem is examined with the relativistic Schr ̈odinger equation, there is acondition onαindependent ofZfor stability. Ifα<1.94=0.0106, stability occurs all the"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"140John D. Barrowwayuptothe critical valueα=2πZ=0.1061(6/Z), whereas ifα>128/15π=2.716,the system is unstable for all values ofZ.Inthe presence of arbitrarily large magneticfields, matter composed of electrons and nuclei is known to become unstable ifαorZis too large.(d)Using a series of non-linear inequalities that are more powerful and rigorous thanconventional estimates using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle alone, Lieb andcollaborators [42] analyzed the conditions needed for finite ground-state energies inatoms of any size. They proved that matter is stable ifα<0.06=1/16.67 andα<0.026 (6/Z)1/2. Thus the stability of matter with coulomb forces has been proved fornon-relativistic dynamics, including arbitrarily large magnetic fields, and for relativisticdynamics without magnetic fields. In both cases stability requires that the fine-structureconstant be not too large.(e)If stars are to exist, it must be hot enough at their centers for thermonuclear reac-tions to occur. This requiresαto be bounded above byα2<20me/mpr. Carter[35] has also pointed out the existence of the very sensitive coincidenceα12≈(me/mpr)4Gm−2pr\u0002−1c−1that must be met if stars are to undergo a convective phase,but this stringent condition no longer seems to be essential for planet formation.These limits are the result of rather coarse-grained arguments. One imagines that ifthe form of life is specified more narrowly, then the limits arising from requirementsfor the persistence of stable planetary environments with atmospheres and on thebiochemical functioning of that form of life would be rather stronger.Fine-tuning in chemistrySimultaneous variations of constants in chemistrySo far, as in almost all the existing literature, we have only mentioned limits arisingwhen one constant (e.g.α)ischanged. What happens if several are changed in valuesimultaneously? Interestingly, there is a simple case where precise conclusionsare possible. The non-relativistic Schr ̈odinger equation possesses a simple scalinginvariance if we change the electron mass,me, and the fine-structure constant,α, simultaneously. The Hamiltonian for a non-relativistic atomic system is [6](ignoring the kinetic energy of the nucleus,\rxiis the position vector of theithelectron,\rRjis the position vector of thejthnucleus):H=− ̄h22me\ti∂i∂\rxi·∂i∂\rxi+e2×\ti\tj−Zj|\rxi−\rRi|+12\ti<k1|\rxi−\rxk|−12\ti<kZjZl|\rRj−\rRl|\u000b"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"8Chemistry and sensitivity141Now transform to new dimensionless position variables (\ry,\rS)byusing the Bohrradius as the unit of length:\ry=\rxa0,\rS=\rRa0wherea0= ̄h2mec2is the Bohr radius.

The double helices of its DNA molecules will differ onlyin size; its water molecules will display the same remarkable properties that flowfrom its special bond angles but will differ solely in overall scale.The consequences of this invariance do not seem to have been addressed in thestudy of the sensitivity of biochemistry to the constants of nature. Note, however,that this scaling invariance does not hold whenrelativisticatomic structure effectsare included or when other forces of nature intervene (as becomes inevitable forsufficiently large variations). Of course, one can hypothesize arbitrary changes inconstants (includingαandme)under the assumption that no Schr ̈odinger equationgoverns them. We can conceive of these worlds with arbitrary atoms, but we cannotdeduce any of the properties of those atoms without an underlying equation ofwhich they are eigenstates. The scaling invariance does not govern them in thiscase, but the assumption is useless because without a Schr ̈odinger (or Schr ̈odinger-like) equation there is no way of deducing any atomic properties at all."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"142John D. BarrowThis scaling invariance also holds for Newtonian gravity (also an inverse squarelaw force like the Coulomb force) and can be used to transform exact solutions ofNewtonian gravity with a constant value ofGinto new ones in whichGvaries withtime or in which the gravitating masses all vary with time [32].Some effects of relativityThe scale invariance of atomic structure is broken when relativistic effects areintroduced. They become important for heavy elements since relativistic effectscan be gauged by the magnitude of orbital velocitiesv∼Zαc, whereZis theatomic number. They become significant whenZαbecomes of order unity. Recently,there has been considerable interest in the sensitivity of relativistic contributions toatomic lines when very small changes (a few parts in 106) are made to the valueof the fine-structure constant,α.For several years, John Webb, Michael Murphy,Victor Flambaum, Vladimir Dzuba, and I [33, 34]have been studying the distancesbetween different absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars and comparingthem with line separations from identical atomic transitions in the laboratory. Theobservational program has completed detailed analyses of three separate quasarabsorption line data sets taken at the Keck Telescope and finds persistent evidencethat is consistent with the fine-structure constant,α,having beensmallerin the past,at redshiftz. The shift in the value ofαfor all the data sets is given provisionallybyα/α≡{α{z}−α(0)}/α(0)=(−0.54±0.12)×10−5for spectra originatingin the redshift rangez=0.2–3.7, whereα(0) is the value of the fine-structureconstant here and now. This result is currently the subject of detailed analysis andreanalysis by the observers in order to search for possible systematic biases in theastrophysical environment or in the laboratory determinations of the spectral lines.This result is based on the analysis of about 950 spectra from 129 quasar systemsin three separate samples, with both the observations and data analysis being doneby three separate groups. A new VLT-UVES quasar sample of Mg II systemsin the Southern sky has very recently been analyzed by Chandet al.[43], whoreportα/α=(−0.06±0.06)×10−5(assuming terrestrial isotope abundances1)from 18 quasars atz=0.4–2.3 using the method of Webbet al., who are also atpresent analyzing this high-quality dataset, but employing simpler data-analysistechniques. A significant difference between the results from the North and Southsky subsamples has been recently noted in these studies with the Webb data, givingα/α=(−0.66±0.12)×10−5for the subsample of 96 quasars in the Northernsky andα/α=(−0.36±0.19)×10−5for the subsample of 32 quasars in theSouthern sky [44].1The Chandet al. data was reanalyzed to giveα/α=(−0.44±0.16)×10−5in [51]."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"8 Chemistry and sensitivity143In order to carry out these astronomical studies of the constancy ofαover tenbillion years of light-travel time from the most distant quasars in the observationalsample, Flambaum’s group carried out detailed many-body computations of theenergy levels of atomic species of relevance to the astronomical datasets. It wasthen possible to examine all the energy-level differences between pairs of linesin different multiplets in order to evaluate the sensitivity of these differences tovery small changes inα. The power of this method is that the astronomical data arerequired to produce a simultaneous fit to many line separations with different contri-butions from two relativistic contributions to the energy levels. Although the energydifferences between different relativistic lines can be systematically computed foragiven value ofα,itisnot obvious ahead of computation what will be the effect onany particular energy level of a small change in the value ofα.Infact, even thesignof the change in the energy level created by, say, a small increase inαis not obvious.Some line separations increase, whereas others decrease, for the same change in thevalue ofα. This technique is therefore a powerful diagnostic of possible differencesin the value ofαat high redshift compared with its value here and now: about 50times more powerful than direct laboratory determinations of the constancy ofαby using atomic fountains. And so the reported variations have no consequencesthat are yet at an observable level in the laboratory. The interest of these studies forchemistry is that we have carried out a systematic examination of the sensitivity ofdifferent line separations to small changes inα,asshown in Figure8.1.Simulated spectra show how changing the value of the fine-structure constantaffects the absorption of near-ultraviolet light by various atomic species. Each atomor ion has a unique pattern of lines. Changes in the fine-structure constant affectmagnesium, silicon, and aluminum less than iron, zinc, nickel, and chromium. Theconsequences of different fractional changes (negative sign signifies a decrease)for the absorption wavelengths are shown.Some heavy species such as Fe are fairly insensitive to changes inα, and so theycan be used as “anchors” against which to measure the sensitivity of other lines bylooking at the line separations between these species and Fe. In Figure8.1,weseethe effects of growing percentage changes in the value of the fine-structure constanton the energy levels of the species shown.

It is therefore of interest to seehow a general analysis of such situations might be performed so as to identifythose factors that play the leading role in sustaining a dynamical (which neednot also be a thermodynamical) equilibrium. It is instructive to adapt an exam-ple from mathematical biology [45] that provides a very simple model exam-ple (for refinements and criticisms of its application to biological systems, seeKing and Pimm [46]). It can be generalized to other types of rate equation anddifferent types of equilibria (for example, oscillatory limit-cycle attractors) asrequired."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"8 Chemistry and sensitivity145Suppose that our chemical environment is controlled byntime-dependent vari-ablesx, and, for simplicity, assume that they satisfy a system ofnlinear ordinarydifferential equations ̇x=AxwhereAis ann×nmatrix. This system of equations has a solutionx=0 that weshall take to be the stable equilibrium solution for the situation under study. To makethe stable equilibrium as simple as possible, we will assume that the eigenvaluesofAare all equal to−1. Now, we are interested in the effects of small stochasticperturbations on this equilibrium. In particular, what does it take to destroy theequilibrium?Weadd toAanother matrix,S, whose elements are drawn from a normal proba-bility distributionN(0,σ2) with zero mean and a variance denoted byσ2.Afractionfof the elements of the matrixAwill be populated in this way; the rest will be zero,so 0≤f≤1. Thus, the parameterfis a measure of the complexity of the stochasticperturbations: asf→1, more and more of thenvariables,x, are coupled together,whereas asf→0, the matrixSis very sparse, and different variables,x, are rel-atively uncoupled by the perturbations. Likewise, asnincreases, so the systembecomes larger, with more and more components of the vectorxcoming into play.Finally, as the variance of the stochastic perturbations,σ2, increases, so the broaderis the influence of random effects from one interaction pathway to others. Thus, thecomplex system is now turned into the stochastic differential equation ̇x=[A+{S}]xThis system has a remarkably simple response to the stochastic perturbation. Theequilibrium atx=0 remains stable with probability 1 in the face of random per-turbations so long asnfσ2<1but ifnfσ2>1, it becomes unstable. The interpretation is simple. The instabilitycondition requires the system to become very large (n→∞), very complex (f∼O(1)), or highly connected (σ2→∞). In practice, living systems can avoid instabil-ity by evolving into a situation where the matrixAis effectively block diagonal, sothat it behaves as though it is a smaller matrix with a far smaller value ofn. Thus, ina complicated ecosystem, stability may be sustained because not all species interactwith all others, only a small subset form a strongly interacting subset. More recently,a number of interesting mathematical studies have been made into the structure ofconnected networks (and the so-called small-world effect) following the famousdiscovery by Erd ̈os and R ́enyi [47] that “almost any” random graph with more than"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"146John D.

These are likely tohave implications for the stability of complex chemical or biochemical networks.It will also be important to specify carefully what is meant by stability. It may beenough for the effects of perturbations merely to be bounded rather than that theydie to zero (i.e. “asymptotic stability” in mathematical parlance).Sensitivity in chaotic systemsThere has been much debate as to the sensitivity of the evolutionary process. Gouldhas argued that it is sensitive to small changes, so that if we replayed the tape ofevolution again we would end up with a completely different result. Others, likeConway Morris [48], have argued that the same overall pattern of developmentwould ensue, even though the details would vary. We can add just two things tothis discussion. The first is that we must distinguish between “large” and “small”perturbations. Large perturbations that arise from outside the adaptive system, forexample in the form of catastrophic impacts by comets or asteroids, clearly do havethe power to change the whole course of evolution – by eliminating all life in themost extreme cases – and cannot be regarded as small perturbations. Second, it isimportant to understand more fully the nature of chaotic processes. Everyone isnow familiar with the notion of a system that displays the propensities of chaos.The slightest perturbation will rapidly be amplified and produce significant effects.Hence it is tempting to draw Gould’s conclusion that a chaotically unpredictablebranching time series like the evolutionary process must end up giving a differentoutcome if its history is rerun with a slightly different starting state. However, thesituation is more subtle than this. Consider the motions of molecules in a room. AsMaxwell was the first to appreciate, these motions are chaotically unpredictable.Any small uncertainty in the trajectory of a given molecule will be exponentiallyamplified after a few collisions to become larger than the whole range of possibilitiesopen to it. Yet, despite this unpredictability in the small, we have Boyle’s Law inthe large, linking the pressure,P,volume,V, and temperature,T,ofthegasbythesimple relationPV/T=constantThus, although the individual molecular motions are chaotically unpredictable, theiraverage behavior is entirely predictable and satisfies a particular probability distri-bution (the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution). Quantities, such as the temperaturethat appear in Boyle’s Law are measures of the average speed of the molecules.If we reran the “tape” of the history of our gas, we would find essentially thesame average behavior, in accord with Boyle’s Law, even though the individualtrajectories of the molecules would be quite different."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"8 Chemistry and sensitivity147This feature of probabilistic determinism, or well-defined average behavior, isa feature of most chaotic systems. It reveals why one should not conclude that thetape of evolution would have to come out differently if played again just becauseevolution is a chaotically unpredictable process in the mathematical sense.The world is not enoughAt the meeting that inspired this volume, it was clear that a sharp difference in“culture” exists between chemists and physicists. The latter were at home withthe idea of “changing” the values of the constants of nature and evaluating theviability of the virtual realities so formed. They were used to the idea that otheruniverses might exist, either in a Platonic sense or in the more mundane situationthat constants are actually variables in our universe, and only in some universes or insome parts of our universe will life be possible. By contrast, chemists are generallyloth to indulge in this type of perturbation of reality, and it is interesting to considerwhy this might be. Some of the reasons may be sociological, but other explanationsmay be consequences of the types of problem with which they are engaged.Why are chemists generally reluctant to carry out analyses of the sensitivity ofchemical and biochemical structures and pathways to small changes in the con-stants of nature? It is interesting that they will in general enter numerical values forconstants at the outset of an analysis, and thus the sensitivity of a result to particu-lar constants of nature will be hidden. By contrast, if constants are only evaluatednumerically at the end of the calculation, their role is transparent. More important,I suspect, is the nature of the problems that chemists and biochemists address.In complex chemical networks, the environmental conditions of temperature andpressure can determine the chemical outcome, or in the situation of astrophysicalchemistry, by the external cosmic ray flux. The effect of changing a constant ofnature by a small amount can easily be totally dominated by the effects of smallenvironmental changes. Also, in a complex network it is very hard to evaluatewhether the effect of making a small change in a fundamental physical constantwill destroy the possibility of a similar nearby equilibrium. Extremely non-linearsystems are able to find new equilibria in a way that is not available to the situ-ation, common in astrophysics, where a structure arises as a simple equilibriumbetween gravity and another force of nature. A classical series of examples arethose displaying self-organized critical behavior, such as the sand-pile paradigmof Per Bak [49]. For such reason, along with the entirely sensible viewpoint thatthey have their hands full trying to understand this world without inventing others,chemists have, in the main, resisted the temptation to create virtual chemistriesby changing dimensionless constants of nature. However, another type of study isavailable to them that gives definite information about the consequences of changing"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"148John D. Barrowfundamental bonds and constants of nature. This is the process of element substi-tution. Thus, for example, the sensitivity of the properties of water (H2O) can bestudied by comparing it with the structure of heavy water (D2O) formed by replac-ing hydrogen with its isotopes, deuterium or tritium, to make HDO, D2O, and T2O,or by changing the oxygen isotope from16Oto17Oor18Otoform, say, H217O,H218O, or D218O. The detailed properties of these hybrid forms of water can befound listed at theWater Structure and Behaviorwebsite maintained by MartinChaplin [50]. Similar strategies can be observed in physics where muonic atoms(with muons substituted for electrons) or states of positronium show what happensif the proton-to-electron-mass ratio is changed in conventional atoms.It is clear from these considerations that the complex problems faced in biochem-istry require an approach different from the early-universe studies of cosmologists.The latter are used to clear-cut consequences of possible changes in the valuesof constants of nature or the dimensions of spacetime. The sciences of complex-ity, while open to investigations of this sort in many areas, also challenge us tounderstand the stability of complex networks and the couplings to their wider envi-ronments.References[1]L.

Instead, philosophers and theologians haveapproached such questions within their own domains of competence. One suchexample is provided by the question of purpose in evolution (see the discussionbelow). Indeed, the concept of purpose in a general sense may be understood assomething that one sets before oneself as an object to be attained, an aim to be kept,a plan to be formulated. In attempting to give an answer to the question of “purposein nature,” we should discuss the main components of human knowledge in anintegrated way, so as to ask the right questions in the right field of knowledge. Thisapproach should encourage us to provide appropriate answers that are reasonablewithin philosophy, science, or theology. At this juncture, it may also be argued thatthe task of a scientist should be independent of those of the other areas of humanculture (Russell,1991,p.13). On the other hand, it is surely useful to be aware thatthis view of the role of science that is “divorced” from both philosophy and naturaltheology can also be seen from a different point of view (Townes,1995,p.166):because science and religion are evolving and are similar in their search for truth,convergence of these independent searches for truth may occur in the future.I wish to address some questions in philosophy and theology that are pertinentto the main subject of this chapter. In order not to go beyond the natural boundariesof either science or theology, I will discuss contemporary attempts to encompassDarwinian evolution in a natural theological context. To meet this objective, weneed some definitions to make this chapter self-contained.First,teleologymay be considered in two separate ways: either it is a doctrineaccording to which everything in the cosmos has been designed with humans inFitness of the Cosmos for Life: Biochemistry and Fine-Tuning,ed.

This latter concept is intimately related to the Anthropic Principle, asemployed either in physics or in biochemistry. Teleology is also related to variousinterpretations of fine-tuning in phenomena such as the nuclear reaction of berylliumatoms in the production of carbon, as originally pointed out by Fred Hoyle (Hoyle,1975, pp. 401–2).Second, the notion ofprocessdominates the work of three philosophers of thelast century: Henri-Louis Bergson (1859–1941), Samuel Alexander (1859–1938),and Alfred North Whitehead (1861–1947) (see Ayer,1982, pp. 208–9). In passing,it is perhaps worth noting that process theology is based on the metaphysics ofWhitehead, who rejected Divine Action in terms of causality, proposing that Godacts persuasively in all events, but not necessarily in determining their character.Specifically, Whitehead pointed out the incoherence of belief in a lifeless universe.Elsewhere in this book, Haught (Chapter 3) has emphasized God as the soleground for the world’s being (see also Haught,1998). This approach to natu-ral theology leads him to explain the world in terms of evolution, as understoodwithin the Darwinian tradition (Russell,1996). Russell focuses on features of pro-cess thought. This philosophical system is considered to be particularly helpfulin the task of constructing an evolutionary theology that may throw some furtherlight on Darwinism.Afar-reaching implication of the possibility of interpreting the evolutionaryaspects of Darwinism within theology is that the evolutionary process begins atthe molecular level of biochemistry. In fact, such “chemical” evolution is a time-honored discipline that has been studied extensively in the past, particularly duringthe last decade of the twentieth century (see, for example, Ponnamperuma andChela-Flores,1993; Chela-Floreset al., 2001). In this chapter, I endeavor to showthat fine-tuning in biochemistry is a well-defined problem. Its evolutionary aspectsshould, in principle, be able to be integrated into a framework of natural theology,for instance in approaches such as kenotic process theology.Process philosophy, or “process thought,” attempted to provide a common meta-physical basis for discussions of science and religion. Some criticisms have beenraised in the past (Polkinghorne,1996,p.28): if physics is to be appropriate forprocess thought, this school of philosophy has to face an ongoing debate. In par-ticular, continuity seems to be intrinsic to quantum mechanics (for example, theSchr ̈odinger equation is a differential equation). For Polkinghorne, at least, themathematics of process thought should be that of “difference” equations, insteadof “differential” equations (with their implied underlying continuity).On the other hand, we should keep in mind deeper issues that are currentlyunder debate as quantum gravity aims to provide a coherent theory of spacetime."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"9Fitness of the cosmos for evolution of life153Spacetime is a dynamic entity, and as such it would have quantum properties (Rov-elli,2000). Both current and future developments in theoretical physics have toinvestigate the concept ofdiscreteexcitations of space itself. Thus, process thought,as a philosophical system, cannot be ruled out at present, because of an unfinisheddebate in theoretical physics.Tocomplete our discussion of contemporary attempts to encompass Darwinismin a natural theological context, we ask whether there is evidence of purpose inthe cosmos. If we allow the simultaneous approaches of philosophy, theology, andscience, it seems possible to reconsider the question that has been raised in the past:Is there evidence of purpose in the cosmos? And, in particular, is there any evidenceof purpose in biochemistry?Wecan consider how the cosmos itself is well fitted for the origin and evolutionof life. I will discuss how the combined approaches of philosophy, science, andultimately natural theology can help us to begin to discuss the intelligibility of theuniverse in a rational way. Care is needed in addressing the right questions withintheir corresponding cultural domains.First, we consider the origin and evolution of intelligent behavior in the cosmos,examining the case of life on earth. As already pointed out above, investigations ofthe evolution of life on earth (Darwinism) can be incorporated in natural theology(process theology), at least in principle. The subsequent arguments in this chapter,within the boundaries of science, should, I hope, be useful for their interpretationin terms of theological issues.Biochemical fine-tuning and fitness of the cosmos for lifeOur starting point for studying the fitness of the cosmos for the origin and evolutionof life is Lawrence J. Henderson’s influentialThe Fitness of the Environment(1913).As a graduate of and professor at Harvard University, Henderson’s main interestsranged widely, and he became a physiologist, chemist, biologist, philosopher, andsociologist. He discussed the question of teleology in biochemistry to give somerationale to the question of the fitness of the environment for the evolution of life.For many chemical compounds, he discussed the difficulties that the evolution oflife would have encountered had these compounds not been freely available inthe environment. One obvious example used by Henderson was water, the searchfor which even today is a main objective of our explorations of the solar system,especially Mars, Europa, Titan, and Enceladus (the tiny Saturn moon).Today, we need to search the roots of Henderson’s biocentrism at the molecularlevel. In fact, fine-tuning in biochemistry is represented by the strength of thechemical bonds that makes the universal genetic code possible. Neither transcriptionnor translation of the messages encoded in RNA and DNA would be possible if the"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"154Julian Chela-Floresstrength of the bonds had different values. Hence, life, as we understand it today,would not have arisen.In this chapter, I will argue in favor of the fitness of the cosmos for the originand evolution of life without touching on the question of teleology. Instead, Iapproach the subject by considering biological evolution in the universe, as wellas the evolution of the structure of the cosmos itself. I will touch on the evolutionof solar systems, interstellar matter, and finally various aspects of the cosmos – allin relation to the emergence of life. However, I hasten to point out that argumentsbased on science can nevertheless be a source of inspiration for reconsideringthe bases of natural theology. I will argue that the fitness of the universe for theorigin and evolution of life can be best understood not only through convergencein biochemistry, but also through a range of convergences based on observations ofphenomena in the space sciences.The Weak Anthropic Principle in cosmology and biochemistryIn cosmology or biology, we may inquire whether general mechanisms (for instance,natural selection and adaptive radiation), as well as special values of some physicalconstants, could be interpreted together in natural theology as indications of pur-pose. The example of “fine-tuning” in physics has led to a weaker and a strongerversion of the Anthropic Principle, which is concerned with the question of the basesof life, particularly intelligent life, in the cosmos. I have no difficulty in acceptingwhat has come to be known as the “Weak Anthropic Principle” in physics:Change the laws (and constants of nature), and the universe that would emerge most likelywould not be compatible with life.Biochemistry offers a clearly analogous statement:First omit the observed cosmic abundance of the biogenic elements that are favorable tolife. Then omit the environments (earth-like planets or Europa-like satellites) that favorevolution and adaptive radiation. The consequence of omitting both factors is that life mostlikely would not arise.However, difficulties certainly would arise, both in cosmology as well as in biology,if we allowed some degree of teleology to be brought into the argument. Here, ofcourse, I am referring to formulation of the “Strong Anthropic Principle”:\u0001The laws of nature and the physical constants were established so that human beingswould arise in the universe.\u0001The distribution of earth-like environments and Europa-like satellites was laid out so thatnot only life, but at least in certain circumstances human beings, would also arise in theuniverse."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"9Fitness of the cosmos for evolution of life155The general mechanisms of nature, according to the evidence that we can inferfrom the biota of earth, which by now is at least 3 billion years old, imply thatthe evolution of intelligent behavior seems inevitable. What is not evident is theinevitability of the emergence of human beings.The intimately related concepts of the Anthropic Principle and fine-tuning inliving systems (Carr and Rees,2003) are topics that would be simpler to under-stand with knowledge of more than a single instance of emergence of life on earth.On the other hand, the West’s religious traditions go back to Jewish theology: asole omnipotent God created heaven and earth, and subsequently life on earth. Thisview of our origins has traditionally been referred to as the “First Genesis.” Withthe emergence of astrobiology (Chela-Flores,2001), we can start to explore thepossibility of the occurrence of a “Second Genesis” – namely, whether the evolu-tion of intelligent behavior is inevitable in an evolving cosmos, given the presentlaws of cosmology (general relativity) and the general mechanisms of biologicalevolution (natural selection and adaptive radiation). If we were to change theselaws and mechanisms, the arguments supporting the inevitability of the evolutionof intelligent behavior would not stand, and thus the evolution of intelligent beingswould not necessarily take place. This aspect of evolution has clear implicationsfor the Weak Anthropic Principle.A first aspect of convergence: cultural convergenceIn the search for answers that go beyond the boundaries of a given area of humanculture, we should first consider whether the various approaches would ever con-verge. The concept of convergence enters our discussion in three different contexts.In this section, I consider convergence in different cultural areas (Townes,1995,p. 166). The other two aspects that are discussed in the following two sections are(1) convergence at a cosmic level, a subject that is essentially based in the spacesciences, and (2) convergence in biology, a topic that is central to understandingDarwinian evolution.Both science and religion are concerned with the common understanding of lifein the universe. Because they largely address the same questions, we would expectthat both aspects of human culture should at some point converge. With subse-quent progress in philosophy, science, and theology, convergence seems unavoid-able, although human culture does not seem to show any evidence of convergenceat present. The status of the relationship between these three disciplines – phi-losophy, science, and theology – has been discussed in the past (John Paul II,1992). In this chapter, an integrated approach to the questions regarding the fit-ness of the universe for the origin and evolution of life aims to avoid a splinteredculture."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"156Julian Chela-FloresA second aspect of convergence: convergence at the cosmic levelIn this section, I will discuss five cases of convergence at the cosmic level. First, fromorganic chemistry we know that nuclear synthesis is relevant for the generation of theelements of the periodic table beyond hydrogen and helium and, eventually, for thefirst appearance of life in solar systems. The elements synthesized in stellar interiorsare required for making the organic compounds that have been observed in thecircumstellar, as well as the interstellar, medium in comets and other small bodies.The same biogenic elements are also needed for synthesis of the biomoleculesof life. Moreover, the spontaneous generation of amino acids in the interstellarmedium is suggested by general arguments based on biochemical experimentation:the study of amino acids in the room-temperature residue of an interstellar iceanalog has yielded 16 amino acids, some of which are also found in meteorites(Mu ̃noz Caroet al., 2002; see also Bernsteinet al., 2002). These factors help us tounderstand the first steps in the eventual habitability of planets.On the other hand, the concept of cosmic convergence has a second aspect thatmay be inferred from what we know about the small bodies, such as the Murchisonmeteorite. These bodies may even play a role in the origin of life: according tochemical analyses in this particular meteorite, we find basic molecules that areneeded for the origin of life such as lipids, nucleotides, and more than 70 aminoacids (Cronin and Chang,1993). Most of the amino acids are not relevant to life onearth and may be unique to meteorites.This demonstrates that those amino acids present in the Murchison meteorite,which also play the role of protein monomers, are indeed of extraterrestrial origin.In addition, chemical analysis has demonstrated the presence of a variety of aminoacids in the Ivuna and Orgueil meteorites (Ehrenfreundet al., 2001). If the presenceof biomolecules on the early earth is due in part to the bombardment of interplanetarydust particles, comets, and meteorites, then the same phenomenon could be takingplace in any other solar system.Interstellar gas provides yet another illustration of the convergent phenomenonthat occurs at a cosmic level. Indeed, solar systems, many of which are now known,originate from interstellar dust that is constituted mainly of the fundamental ele-ments of life, such as C, N, O, S, P, and a few others. When a star explodes intoa supernova, all the elements that have originated in its interior as a result of ther-monuclear reactions are expelled, thus contributing to the interstellar dust. The staritself collapses under its own gravity, compressing its matter to a degenerate state;the laws of microscopic physics eventually stabilize its collapse into a white dwarf.Stellar evolution of stars more massive than the sun is far more interesting. Afterthe star has burnt out its nuclear fuel, a catastrophic explosion follows in which an"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"9Fitness of the cosmos for evolution of life157enormous amount of energy and matter is released. These supernova explosions arethe source of enrichment of the chemical composition of the interstellar medium.This chemical phenomenon, in turn, provides new raw material for subsequentgenerations of star formation, which leads to the formation of planets. Late in theirevolution, stars are still poor in some of the heavier biogenic elements (for instance,magnesium and phosphorus). Such elements are the product of nucleosynthesis trig-gered in the extreme physical conditions that occur in the supernova event itself.By this means, the newly synthesized elements are disseminated into interstellarspace, becoming dust particles after a few generations of star births and deaths.An additional case that argues in favor of convergence at a cosmic level is emerg-ing from what we are beginning to learn about the origin of planetary systems aroundstars. Our solar system formed in the midst of a dense interstellar cloud of dust andgas, essentially a circumstellar disk around the early sun. Some evidence suggeststhat this event was triggered by the shock wave of a nearby supernova explosionmore than five billion years ago. Indeed, some evidence indicates the presenceof silicon carbide (carborundum, SiC) grains in the Murchison meteorite, a factdemonstrating that they are matter from a type II supernova (Hoppeet al., 1997).Wemay now be observing an extrasolar circumstellar disk around a young, three-million-year-old, sun-like star in the constellation Monoceros (Kerr,2002). Severalearlier examples of circumstellar disks are known, including a significantly narrowone around an eight-million-year-old star. The narrowness of this disk suggests thepresence of planets constraining the disk (Schneideret al., 1999). The followingadditional information further supports the arguments in favor of universal mecha-nisms of convergence in the formation of solar systems. The matter of the originalcollapsing interstellar cloud does not coalesce into the star itself, but collapses intothe spinning circumstellar disk, where planets are thought to be formed by a processof accretion. Some planetesimals collide and stay together because of the gravita-tional force. In addition, a variety of small bodies are formed in the disk, prominentamong which are comets, asteroids, and meteorites, completing the componentsthat make up a solar system.Finally, the fifth example of what I have called “cosmic convergence” is providedby the convergent origin of hydrospheres and atmospheres. The earliest preservedgeologic period (the lower Archaean) may be considered as representing the tail endof the “heavy bombardment period.” During that time, various small bodies, includ-ing comets, collided frequently with the early precursors of the biomolecules thateventually ignited the evolutionary process on earth and in its oceans. In addition,comets may be the source of other volatile substances significant to the biosphere,as well as the biochemical elements that were precursors of the biomolecules. Col-lisions with comets, therefore, are thought to have played a significant role in the"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"158Julian Chela-Floresformation of the hydrosphere and atmosphere of habitable planets, including earth.The sources of comets are the O ̈ort cloud and Kuiper belt. These two componentsof the outer solar system seem to be common in other solar systems. Hence, in thiscosmic sense, we recognize evolutionary convergence.A third aspect of convergence: the case for convergence in biologyThe question of evolutionary convergence in the context of the life sciences hasbeen discussed extensively (Conway Morris,2003; Chapter11, this volume; Chela-Flores,2001, pp. 149–62;2003; 2006; Akindahunsi and Chela-Flores,2004).Weare assuming that natural selection is the main driving force of evolution inthe universe, a hypothesis made earlier elsewhere (Dawkins,1983). For thesereasons, it is relevant to question whether local environments that were favor-able for the emergence of life on the early earth were at all unique, occurringexclusively in our own solar system. Another view on the universal validity ofbiology in the cosmos has been advanced in the context of the basic buildingblocks (Pace,2001): it seems likely that the basic building blocks of life any-where will be similar to our own. Amino acids are readily formed from simpleorganic compounds and occur in extraterrestrial bodies, such as meteorites. Func-tions that are suggested as being common to life elsewhere in the cosmos serveto capture adequate energy from physical and chemical processes to conduct thechemical transformations that are necessary for life: lithotropy, photosynthesis, andchemosynthesis. Other factors that argue in favor of the universality of biochem-istry are physical (temperature, pressure, and volume) and genetic constraints (seebelow).In general, we may say that features that become more, rather than less, similarthrough independent evolution will be called “convergent.” In fact, convergencein biology is often associated with similarity of function, as in the evolution ofwings in birds and bats. New World cacti and the African spurge family providean example. Some other examples are the euphorbs, such asEuphorbia stapfii, andsome members of the Madagascar Didieraceae(Didiera madagascariensis). Theseplants are similar in appearance, being succulent, spiny, water-storing, and adaptedto desert conditions (Tudge,1991,p.67; Nigel-Hepper,1982,p.81). However,they are classified in separate and distinct families, sharing characteristics that haveevolved independently in response to similar environmental challenges. Hence, wemay say that this is a typical case of convergence.When we look at convergence at the biochemical level, we can further documentthe general question of evolution in the life sciences. Convergent evolution is man-ifest at the active sites of enzymes and in whole proteins, as well as in the genomeitself, as the following examples show."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"9Fitness of the cosmos for evolution of life159\u0001The northern sea cod(Boreogadus saida)is an economically important marine fish ofthe family Gadidae found on both sides of the North Atlantic. The distantly related orderPerciformes with its suborder Percoidei contains the sea basses, sunfishes, perches, and,more relevant to our interest, the notothenioid fishes from the Antarctic(Dissotichusmawsoni).Inspite of their distant relationship with cods, they have evolved the sametype of antifreeze proteins, in which the amino acids threonine, alanine, and prolinerepeat (Chenet al., 1997). These proteins are active in the fish’s blood and avoid freezingby preventing the ice crystals from growing. The Antarctic fish protein arose over sevenmillion years ago, whereas the Arctic cod first appeared about three million years ago(both species arose in different episodes of genetic shuffling).\u0001The blind cavefishAstyanax fasciatusare sensitive in two long-wavelength visual pig-ments. In humans, the long-wavelength green and red visual pigments diverged aboutthirty million years ago. The mammalian lineage diverged from fishes about four hun-dred million years ago, but a recent episode in evolution has provided fish multiple-wavelength-sensitive green and red pigments. Genetic analysis demonstrates that the redpigment in humans and fish evolved independently from the green pigment by a fewidentical amino acid substitutions (Yokoyama and Yokoyama,1990), a clear case ofevolutionary convergence at the molecular level.\u0001Convergence may also occur when the sequence and structure of molecules are verydifferent, but the mechanisms by which they act are similar. Serine proteases have evolvedindependently in bacteria (e.g. subtilisin) and vertebrates (e.g. trypsin). Despite their verydifferent sequences and three-dimensional structures, in each the same set of three aminoacids form the active site. The catalytic triads are His57, Asp102, and Ser195 (trypsin)and Asp32, His64, and Ser221 (subtilisin) (Doolittle,1994;A.Tramontano, personalcommunication).Evolutionary convergence in biology has been best documented at the level of ani-mals. The evolutionary biology of the Bivalvia, at the level of both zoology andpaleontology, provides multiple examples of convergence and parallel evolution, afact that makes the interpretation of their evolutionary history difficult (Harperet al.,2000). Specific examples of convergence in mollusks have been pointed out in vari-ous families of the gastropods (camaenid, helminthoglyptid, and helcid snails). Theshells of the camaenid snails from the Philippines and the helminthoglyptid snailsfrom Central America resemble each other and also members of European helcidsnails. These distant species, in spite of having quite different internal anatomies,have grown to resemble each other morphologically in response to their environ-ment. In other words, in spite of considerable anatomical diversity, mollusks fromthese distant families have come to resemble one another in terms of their externalcalcareous shell (Tucker Abbott,1989, pp. 7–8).In addition, we should recall that among birds the Passeriformes (including swal-lows) may be confused with Apodiformes (including swifts), but are not related tothem. Swallows and swifts provide a classical example of evolutionary convergence."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"160Julian Chela-FloresAlthough unrelated, swallows are generally similar to swifts in size, proportion, andaerial habits (Clench and Austin,1983). Members of these two orders differ widelyin anatomy, and their similarities are the result of convergent evolution on differentstocks that have become adapted to the same lifestyles in similar ecosystems forboth species.Can convergent pathways of evolution in the cosmos be foreseen?Above I have argued that fine-tuning in biochemistry is represented in molecularbiological terms by the strength of chemical bonds that make the universal geneticcode possible. The messages coded in RNA and DNA would not be possible ifthe strengths of the bonds had different values. Hence, life, as we understand ittoday, would not have arisen. Subsequent evolutionary stages beyond molecularevolution in biochemistry (i.e. beyond chemical evolution of the building blocks oflife) will depend on certain factors that can be documented with further research inthe geologic record of hydrothermal vent communities and with the exploration ofthe solar system. I will review some of them, beginning with the geologic record.Some evidence indicates that once life originates, provided sufficient (geologic)time is available, evolution will provide living organisms with the opportunity tooccupy every conceivable environment. This notion further favors the hypothesisthat once life appears at a microscopic level on a given planet or satellite, theeventual evolution of intelligent behavior is just a matter of time.The inevitability of some of the earliest stages of the evolution of life on earthcan be illustrated with careful analysis of the geologic record. For instance, Cam-brian fauna, such as lamp-shells (inarticulate brachiopods) and primitive mollusks(Monoplacophora), were maintained during Silurian times by microorganisms thatlived in hydrothermal vents (Littleet al., 1997). Many examples of such fossils havebeen retrieved from the Silurian Yaman Kasy sulfide deposit. This volcanogenicsite is located in the Orenburg district (southern Urals, Russia). In modern ventcommunities, monoplacophorans have been recovered at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge(37o50\u0005N), and brachiopods from mid-ocean ridges are also recorded. However,taxonomic analysis of Cenozoic fossils suggests that shelly vent taxa are not ances-tors of modern vent mollusks or brachiopods (Littleet al., 1998). We may concludethat modern vent taxa support the hypothesis that the vent environment is not arefuge for evolution.In fact, evidence exists that since the Paleozoic and through the Mesozoic era,taxonomic groups have moved in and out of vent ecosystems through time: nosingle taxon has been able to escape evolutionary pressures. Some independentsupport for deep-water extinction has also been presented (Jacobs and Lindberg,1998). These findings rule out the possibility that deep-sea environments are refuges"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"9Fitness of the cosmos for evolution of life161against evolutionary pressures. In other words, the evidence so far does not sup-port the idea that there could be environments where ecosystems might escapebiological evolution, even in the apparently unassailable depths of the oceans. Thisgives considerable support to the hypothesis that any microorganism, in whateverenvironment on earth or elsewhere, would be inexorably subject to evolutionarypressures.As I have shown above, fossils from Silurian hydrothermal vent fauna demonst-rate that species have become extinct in locations that at first sight seem to be farremoved from the pressures of evolutionary forces. Given that there are no refugesagainst evolution, we can raise the question whether over geologic time it wasinevitable that the most primitive cellular blueprint bloomed into full eukaryogen-esis and beyond, along convergent evolutionary pathways, ultimately to organismsdisplaying intelligent behavior (Chela-Flores,1998).Toinvestigate beyond the geologic record whether subsequent evolutionarystages lead to the evolution of intelligent behavior, we turn to the exploration ofour solar system. In order to investigate, in the short term, whether the evolutionof life is subject to convergence throughout the cosmos, we have at least two pos-sibilities. First, we can directly test whether evolution of intelligent behavior hasfollowed a convergent evolutionary pathway elsewhere in the universe by meansof the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project (Ekerset al., 2002).Unfortunately, no signal that could definitely be interpreted as originating from anadvanced civilization has ever been detected.Asecond alternative, although much more restricted in scope, is currently inprogress. We can test for the possible existence of the lowest stages of the evolu-tionary pathway within the solar system, namely at the level of microorganisms.One approach is currently being carried out in terms of the search for life on Mars.Another approach, still within the solar system, is to search in due course for lifeon the Jovian satellite Europa (Chela-Flores,2003, 2006). Even beyond our solarsystem, scientific research may help us to decide whether environments exist thatfulfill conditions favorable to life’s origin and evolution. This is due in part tothe fact that we are aware of multiple examples of solar systems. In addition, wesuppose that stable conditions persist in extrasolar planets. By stable conditions, itshould be understood that the planet (or satellite), where life may evolve, is boundto a long-lived star. In other words, the time available for the origin and evolutionof life should be sufficient to allow life itself to evolve, before the solar system ofthe host planet or satellite reaches the final stages of stellar evolution, such as at thered-giant and supernova phases.It is also assumed that major collisions of large meteorites with a habitable worldare infrequent after the solar system has passed through its early period of formation.Under such stable conditions, the gradual action of natural selection would be"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"162Julian Chela-Floresexpected to be the dominant mechanism in evolution. Fortunately, the existence ofstable earth-like planetary conditions is an empirical question for which we willbe able to give partial answers in the foreseeable future. Reliable observationaltechniques are currently being provided to image Jupiter-like planets orbiting atseveral astronomical units from their corresponding stars. Hence, we may concludethat in the not-too-distant future we will be able to address the following questionon the evolution of intelligent behavior: is the evolution of the cosmos “fine-tuned”for the inevitable emergence of intelligent behavior throughout the cosmos? Theassumed universality of biological evolution suggests a positive answer to thisquestion, provided that stable planetary conditions are maintained in a given planet,or satellite, over geologic time.A third factor in favor of the inevitability of the evolution of intelligent behaviorin the cosmos is natural selection, which seems to be powerful enough to shapeterrestrial organisms to similar ends, independent of historical contingency. Like-wise, in view of the assumed universality of biology, we would expect evolutionaryprocesses to take place in the cosmos that are mechanistically similar to those thathave driven the evolution of life on earth. I will discuss some examples that supportthis view. Before approaching the question of convergent evolution, however, weshould first recall that the set of factors influencing the relative degree to whichearth’s biota has been shaped is still a debatable topic. According to the hypothe-sis of universal Darwinism, life on earth, and possibly elsewhere, may have beenshaped either by contingency or by the gradual action of natural selection. It may bepossible to document convincingly whether, independent of historical contingency,natural selection is powerful enough for organisms living in similar environmentsto be shaped to similar ends. For this reason, I highlight the following examples,which suggest that, to a certain extent and in certain conditions, natural selectionmay be stronger than chance.\u0001Black European fruit flies(Drosophila subobscura)were transported to California morethan twenty years ago. This event has provided the possibility of testing the role of naturalselection in two different continental environments. Pacific coastD. subobscura(fromSanta Barbara to Vancouver) were compared in wing-length with European specimens(from Southern Spain to the middle of Denmark). After half a dozen generations living insimilar conditions, the increase in wing length was almost identical (four percent). This isa compelling case in favor of the key role played by natural selection in evolution (Hueyet al., 2000).\u0001Anole lizards from some Caribbean islands (Anolisspp.) provide another example of evo-lutionary convergence. In Cuba, Hispaniola (shared by Haiti and the Dominican Repub-lic), Jamaica, and Puerto Rico (the so-called Greater Antilles), the observed phenomenonsuggests that in similar environments adaptive radiation can overcome historical con-tingencies to produce strikingly similar evolutionary outcomes. We could even say thatreplicated adaptive radiationhas occurred in the various islands. In fact, it has been"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"9Fitness of the cosmos for evolution of life163shown that although many species were known to thrive on these islands, some groupsof lizards from different islands living in similar environments also look similar (Lososet al., 1998). Genetic analysis has shown that similar traits have evolved in distantlyrelated species for coping with similar environments (such as living in treetops or on theground): anoles that live on the ground have long, strong hind legs, whereas those livingin treetops have large toe-pads and short legs. Repeated evolution of similar groups ofspecies (both morphologically and ecologically) suggests that adaptation is responsiblefor the predictable evolutionary responses of the anole lizards of the Caribbean. Indeed,we can speak in this case of evolutionary history repeating itself (Vogel,1998).Finally, in order to decide whether the standard laws of physics and biology implythe evolution of intelligent behavior, it is instructive to appreciate the implications ofthe existence of severalconstraints on chance. These constraints are relevant to thequestion of whether life elsewhere might follow pathways analogous to the ones ithas already followed in terrestrial evolution. Christian de Duve has enumerated vari-ous examples of constraints on chance (de Duve,1995, pp. 296–7;2002; Chapter10,this volume).\u0001Not all genes are equally significant targets for evolution. The genes involved in significantevolutionary steps are few in number; these are the so-called regulatory genes. In thesecases, mutations may be deleterious and consequently are not fixed.\u0001Once a given evolutionary change has been retained by natural selection, future changesare severely constrained; for example, once a multicellular body plan has been introduced,future changes are not totally random, as the viability of the organisms narrows down thepossibilities. For instance, once the body plan of mammals has been adopted, mutationssuch as those that are observed inDrosophila, which exchange major parts of their body,are excluded. Such fruit-fly mutations are impossible in the more advanced, mammalianbody plan.\u0001Not every genetic change retained by natural selection is equally decisive. Some maytend to increase biodiversity rather than contribute to a significant change in the courseof evolution.Implicit in Darwin’s work is chance represented by the randomness of mutations inthe genetic patrimony and their necessary filtering by natural selection. However,the novel point of view that astrobiology forces on us is to accept that randomnessis built into the fabric of the living process. Yet, contingency, which is representedby the large number of possibilities for evolutionary pathways, is limited by a seriesof constraints.Natural selection necessarily seeks solutions for the adaptation of evolving organ-isms to a relatively limited number of possible environments. From cosmochemistrywe know that the elements used by the macromolecules of life are ubiquitous inthe cosmos."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"164Julian Chela-FloresTosum up, a finite number of environments force a limited number of options onnatural selection for the evolution of organisms. We expect convergent evolution tooccur repeatedly, wherever life arises. Consequently, it makes sense to search forthe analogs of the attributes that we have learned to recognize on earth, especiallythe evolution of intelligent behavior.ConclusionData from the current fleet of space probes that are capable of searching for signs oflife in the solar system suggest that extraterrestrial life could be identified sometimein the near future. Thus, if we can settle the question of the occurrence of a SecondGenesis elsewhere in the universe, additional information would be available todiscuss the question of fine-tuning in biochemistry. Earlier, I extended the meaningof convergence from biology to the space sciences in an effort to provide a solid sci-entific basis for the concept that the universe is fit for the origin and evolution of life.Closely related to the issue of extending convergence from the life to the spacesciences is the subject of the intelligibility of life in the universe, a significant topicthat requires an explanation. In this chapter, two aspects of the intelligibility oflife in the universe were discussed in scientific terms, namely, the origin and theevolution of intelligent behavior in the universe. The arguments were centered onwhether evolution is dominated by contingency, or by the gradual action of naturalselection. Random gene changes accumulating over time may imply that the courseof evolution is generally unpredictable, but constraints on chance, as argued above,put some powerful bounds on the degree of uncertainty.Other contingent factors are the extinction of species due to asteroid collisions orother calamities, although these uncertainties may affect only the evolution of singlelineages. However, such questions are of lesser interest to the larger issues that arerelevant either to natural theology, or to science. This is particularly true whenthe question of fine-tuning is raised in physics, or biochemistry – that is, whetherthe appearance of biological features such as vision, locomotion, nervous systems,brains, and intelligent behavior is inevitable, rather than the preservation of a givenspecies. I have further argued throughout this chapter that contingency does notcontradict a certain repetition of natural history. Evolution allows a certain degree ofpredictability of the eventual biological properties that are likely to evolve, mainlybecause of convergence in the life sciences, but especially, as we have stressedrepeatedly, because of the useful new concept of convergence in the space sciences.ReferencesAkindahunsi, A.

Were it otherwise, we wouldn’t be around. Thequestion is, therefore, how biofriendly is it? Physicists have addressed this questionand have come to the conclusion that if any of the fundamental physical constantswere a little smaller or a little larger than they are, the universe would be verydifferent from what it is and unable to produce or harbor living organisms. Noteveryone, however, subscribes to the concept of “fine-tuning” embodied in the so-called Anthropic Principle, some preferring instead the notion of a “multiverse,”in which our universe is only one in trillions of trillions, perhaps the only one that,by mere chance, happened to have the right combination of constants to enable itto serve as our birthplace and abode.In contrast, biologists and other scientists interested in biology generally takethe universe for granted and ask instead to what extent the manifestations of life,including humankind, fit within the existing physical and cosmic framework. Noth-ing could better illustrate the depth of their ignorance on this subject than thediversity of answers they have given, which cover virtually the whole array of pos-sibilities. Many agree with the late Jacques Monod, who, in his best-sellerChanceand Necessity(1971), expressed his skepticism in the oft-quoted sentence: “TheUniverse was not pregnant with life, nor the biosphere with man.” In myVital Dust(1995), I defended the diametrically opposed view, also shared by many scientists,that life and mind are “cosmic imperatives,” likely to exist in many areas of the uni-verse. The recent interest in astrobiology and the SETI (Search for Extra-TerrestrialIntelligence) project rest on this assumption. Some scientists make a distinctionbetween life and mind, but once again in two diametrically opposed versions. InRare Earth(2000), the geologist Peter Ward and the astronomer Donald BrownleeFitness of the Cosmos for Life: Biochemistry and Fine-Tuning,ed. J. D.

In contrast, the paleontologist Simon Conway Morris,one of the editors of this book, argues inLife’s Solution(2003) that life may bevery rare, perhaps unique, but that, once arisen, it was bound to give rise to humanbeings. Humans, he states, are “inevitable in a lonely universe.” Both views makeus exceptional, but for totally different reasons.In this chapter, I propose to look at the problem through the eyes of a biochemist.I will first consider the main features that define life as we know it and then askhow such features could have arisen and what environmental conditions would havebeen necessary for them to appear. Finally, in trying to put these notions within acosmic perspective, I hope to derive some assessment of the probability of life’sorigin, a sort of quantitative estimate of the universe’s “biofriendliness.”The hallmarks of lifeWhat Is Life?This question, the title of a famous book by Erwin Schr ̈odinger(1944), has been answered in many different ways, most often stressing the ability ofliving organisms to maintain improbable structures with the help of outside energy,reproduce themselves, and undergo evolution. My own answer to the question issimple – many would call it simplistic, even tautological:Life is all that is commonto all known living organisms. This definition, based on concrete facts that arebeginning to be well understood, allows a number of key properties to be singledout as characteristic of life. I will briefly review these properties in the followingpages. For additional information, the reader can refer to my previously publishedbooks (1984, 1991, 1995, 2002, 2005) and to standard biochemistry textbooks.Water and mineralsAll living organisms contain abundant water and a number of mineral constituents,mostly Na, K, Cl, Ca, and Mg, together with various trace elements, such as Fe,Cu, Mn, Zn, Ni, Co, Mo, Si, F, I, and Se, which, although present in very smallamounts, often play functional roles of central importance.Organic building blocksThe bulk of all living matter is constructed with little more than fifty different organicbuilding blocks, mostly sugars, amino acids, nitrogenous bases, fatty acids, and afew more specialized substances, made with only six elements, represented, not"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"10 How biofriendly is the universe?171very euphonically, by the acronym CHNOPS (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen,phosphorus, sulfur). These building blocks are joined together in different ways toform a number of metabolic intermediates, coenzymes, and other relatively smallmolecules that are found in many different organisms, sometimes in all. Whataccounts for the main differences between the great variety of life forms – whethermicrobes, plants, fungi, animals, or humans – is the ways in which the buildingblocks are assembled into macromolecules, such as polysaccharides, lipids, and,especially, nucleic acids and proteins.CatalysisOf the thousands of chemical reactions that make up metabolism, virtually nonewould occur without an appropriate catalyst, or enzyme. Even a reaction such asthe combination of carbon dioxide with water to form carbonic acid, which hasthe rare distinction of taking place spontaneously at a significant rate, is catalyzedby an enzyme (carbonic anhydrase), which accelerates the reaction more than amillion-fold.Protein enzymesMost enzymes are proteins, which owe their unique functional versatility to thenumber and diversity of their building blocks. The distinctive side chains thatcharacterize the various proteinogenic amino acids include aliphatic and aromaticmolecules, which either are unsubstituted and hydrophobic or bear one of a numberof different hydrophilic groups exhibiting a great diversity of physical properties,thus allowing a wide variety of possible interactions. In proteins, the amino acidsare linked into long polypeptide chains that usually contain several hundred aminoacids.With the exception of structural proteins, which often remain linear, the polypep-tide chains of proteins usually fold into complex, three-dimensional conforma-tions. In enzymes, these conformations bring together certain functional groups ofamino acids that are distantly located in the chain, so as to delimit specific bindingsites and catalytic centers, disposed in such a manner that reaction substrates arefished out from the surrounding medium, immobilized in a particular configuration,and caused to interact. In addition, many enzymes also bear separate sites, calledallosteric, which bind regulatory substances that modify the enzyme’s functionalproperties.More than ninety percent of the chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes areeither group transfers (including hydrolyses, in which water serves as acceptor ofthe transferred group) or electron transfers. These two types of reaction, as will be"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"172Christian de Duveseen, both play major roles in energy transactions. Other enzymatic reactions aremostly isomerizations or reversible molecular splittings.CofactorsProtein enzymes frequently operate with the help of metal ions and with that oforganic cofactors, which either are covalently bound to the enzyme molecule (pros-thetic groups) or act in free, soluble form (coenzymes). As is to be expected,these cofactors serve mostly as carriers in transfer reactions. Several are nucleotidederivatives or have a nucleotide-like structure, thus being related to nucleic acidcomponents. Many contain a vitamin in their molecule.RibozymesAfewbiological catalysts are RNA molecules. Known as ribozymes, these catalyticRNAs are involved in RNA splicing and other forms of RNA processing. A specialribozyme of central importance is the ribosomal peptidyl transferase, the catalystin ribosomes responsible for peptidyl transfer in protein synthesis.EnergyThe central role of ATPThroughout the living world, energy is derived from the environment and used tosupport life by mechanisms that almost invariably end up depending, directly orindirectly, on the hydrolysis of the terminal pyrophosphate bond of ATP, givingADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi):AT P+H2O−→ADP+Pi(10.1)This reaction, in which ATP is sometimes replaced by another NTP, which in turnis subsequently regenerated at the expense of ATP, is exergonic. It releases freeenergy (that is, energy convertible into work, henceforth to be referred to simply asenergy) in an amount that, under physiological conditions, is on the order of 14 kcal,or 59 kJ, per gram molecule of ATP split. This value defines the size of the energypackages used in biological energy transactions, what may be seen as the standardbioenergetic currency unit. If ATP hydrolysis takes place freely, the energy releasedby the reaction is dissipated as heat. Living systems contain a number of transducersthat convert this energy into some form of work, including the mechanical workperformed in animal motility; the osmotic work of forcing substances into cells, orout of them, against a concentration gradient; the electric work dependent on theactive transport of ions and the resulting membrane potentials; the emission of light"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"10 How biofriendly is the universe?173in bioluminescence; and, especially, the many forms of chemical work involved inthe synthesis of natural compounds.Biosynthetic processes are as varied as their products, but share some key fea-tures. One property they have in common is that they rely, in most cases, on thelinking together of small molecules with removal of water (dehydrating condensa-tions). Thus, sugars join into polysaccharides; amino acids into proteins; fatty acidsand alcohols into lipid esters; bases, pentoses, and phosphate into nucleic acids;and so on. In an aqueous medium, such reactions are always strongly endergonic.They are almost invariably supported by ATP, or by some other ATP-related NTP,by way of sequential group transfer mechanisms. In these mechanisms, one of thereactants accepts a piece of the ATP molecule – inorganic phosphate, AMP, or inor-ganic pyrophosphate – forming a complex from which the reactant thus activated istransferred to the other reactant. I have detailed these mechanisms elsewhere (1984,1991, 2000, 2005).Besides fueling biosynthetic processes, ATP hydrolysis also serves to spark manymetabolic reactions. Thus, phosphorylation of substrates – sugars, for example –often initiates their metabolic transformation. In addition, a number of receptor-mediated, regulatory mechanisms depend on the splitting of ATP (or GTP).Living cells can function only a few seconds on their content of ATP and otherNTPs, which need to be continually regenerated at the expense of their split productsfor life to be maintained. Exceptionally, this regeneration may take place at theexpense of stored, high-energy phosphate compounds, including the phosphagens ofanimal cells and, especially, a phosphate polymer, or polyphosphate, found in somebacterial cells. These reservoirs, however, can serve only as a buffer and need to bereplenished with the help of ATP. Therefore, all the energy expenditures of a cellare ultimately dependent on the regeneration of ATP by energy-yielding metabolicprocesses. These processes consist almost exclusively of electron transfers.Electron transfersIn these transactions, electrons – often combined with protons into hydrogen atoms –are transferred from a donor to an acceptor down a difference in energy level, whichis measured by the difference between the redox potentials of the two reactants. Avery large number of such reactions participate in metabolism. To be able to servefor ATP regeneration, electron transfers must satisfy two conditions: (1) they mustrelease enough energy to power the reversal of Reaction 10.1; and (2) they must becoupled to the reversal of this reaction – that is, constrained in such a way that theycan take place only if ADP and inorganic phosphate condense to ATP at the sametime.The energy condition requires the donor and acceptor to be separated by a dif-ference in redox potential of at least (600/n)mV,nbeing the number of electrons"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"174Christian de Duvetransferred. This value represents the minimum needed to provide 14 kcal, or 59kJ, per gram molecule, which we have seen is the energy released by Reaction 10.1and, therefore, the minimum amount of energy required for its reversal. There areessentially two ways in which this difference is created, depending on whether ornot light energy is involved. When it is, an electron in the chlorophyll molecule isdisplaced to a higher energy level with the help of light and allowed to fall back toalower energy level through a phosphorylating system, to be either similarly recy-cled (cyclic photophosphorylation) or used for biosynthetic reductions (see below).In all other cases, electrons are provided from the outside at an appropriately highenergy level, most often by organic foodstuffs, as in all heterotrophic organisms, butsometimes also by mineral donors, as in chemotrophic prokaryotes. After poweringATPassembly, the electrons are taken up at a lower level of energy by an outsideacceptor. Most often (oxidative phosphorylation), this acceptor is molecular oxy-gen, which combines with four electrons and four protons to give two moleculesof water. In certain prokaryotes, the acceptor is a mineral oxidized substance, forexample nitrate or sulfate. Exceptionally, no outside electron acceptor is required;the final acceptor arises metabolically. Such is the case in alcoholic or lactic fermen-tation. In addition, all organisms can, when deprived of their external energy supply(either light or electron donors), use their stored reserves, of fat or carbohydrate,for example, or even their own substance as a source of high-energy electrons.Coupling mechanismsThroughout the living world, the coupling between electron transfer and ATP assem-bly is mediated predominantly by electrochemical mechanisms dependent on pro-tonmotive force. In these mechanisms, known as carrier-level phosphorylations,electrons travel along complex chains of membrane-embedded carriers organizedin such a way that the electrons can move only if protons are translocated at thesame time from one side of the membrane to the other, from which they can returnonly by way of a proton-dependent, ATP-assembling system. In some cases, thismachinery may function in reverse, lifting electrons from a lower to a higher energylevel with the help of ATP generated at some other site.Asecond coupling mechanism, of minor quantitative but immense qualitativeimportance, involves soluble enzyme systems and intermediates. It concerns theoxidation of a few selected aldehydes andα-keto-acids, with NAD+serving aselectron acceptor. The substrates are oxidized jointly with a thiol (R\u0005-SH) in suchamanner that a thioester of the acid is formed:OORC(COO)H+NAD++R\u0005−SH⇔R−C−S−R\u0005+NADH+H+(+CO2)(10.2)"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"10 How biofriendly is the universe?175This type of reaction is almost unique in that it couples the donation of electrons tothe closure of a chemical bond, the thioester bond. This bond, which is energeticallyequivalent to the pyrophosphate bonds of ATP, can be used to power ATP assemblyby sequential group transfer:OOR−C−S−R\u0005+ADP+Pi⇔R−C−OH+R\u0005−SH+ATP(10.3)Adding up the two reactions, one finds that the aldehyde is oxidized to the corre-sponding acid, or that theα-keto-acid is oxidatively decarboxylated to the corre-sponding acid and CO2,while ATP is assembled, with the thiol playing a catalyticrole. This thiol may be a cysteine residue in the enzyme protein; or an enzyme-linkedphosphopantetheine molecule; or coenzyme A, a soluble coenzyme in which phos-phopantetheine is linked to 3\u0005-phospho-AMP; or lipoic acid, also known as thiocticacid, a molecule that can serve at the same time as electron carrier and as groupcarrier, a unique distinction.Reactions of this kind are called substrate-level phosphorylations, as opposed tothe protonmotive force-dependent carrier-level phosphorylations mentioned earl-ier. Substrate-level phosphorylations are involved in only a few processes; but thesebelong to the most central metabolic systems, the glycolytic chain and the Krebscycle, making substrate-level phosphorylations both universal and indispensable.In addition, the reactions are readily reversible (especially with aldehydes as sub-strates). They can serve in the reduction of a carboxyl group (COOH) to a carbonylgroup (CO) with the help of energy provided by the splitting of ATP. As we willsee, this process is of key importance in biosynthetic reductions.It should be further noted that thioesters, with coenzyme A as carrier, play a keyrole as donors of acyl groups in the synthesis of lipids and other esters from freeacids and alcohols. In such cases, the acid is activated to the corresponding thioesterby Reaction 10.3, running from right to left or, more frequently, by the analogousreaction in which ATP is split to AMP and inorganic pyrophosphate.Biosynthetic reductionsAll living organisms carry out some reductive reactions. The conversion of sugarsto fatty acids and the formation of deoxyribose from ribose are important examplesof such reactions. In heterotrophic organisms, these processes are supplied withelectrons by foodstuffs and, if needed, with energy by ATP. The importance ofbiosynthetic reductions is much greater in autotrophic organisms because theseorganisms manufacture their substance with very simple, oxidized building blocks,mostly H2O, CO2,NO−3,and SO2−4.They thus need a considerable additional supply"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"176Christian de Duveof electrons, as well as of energy, as environmental electrons are usually providedat a low energy level.Chemotrophic autotrophs derive the required electrons from mineral donors, forexample hydrogen sulfide (H2S). They lift these electrons to the high energy levelneeded for the reductions with the help of ATP (or protonmotive force) generated bythe downhill transfer of electrons from the same donors to an outside acceptor (mostoften oxygen). Primitive phototrophic bacteria likewise obtain electrons from min-eral donors, but depend largely on light energy for lifting the electrons to a higherenergy level. This process is catalyzed by a chlorophyll-dependent system knownas photosystem I. The more advanced phototrophs, which include cyanobacteria,eukaryotic algae, and plants, have a second chlorophyll-dependent system, pho-tosystem II, which withdraws electrons from water, releasing molecular oxygen,and lifts them to an intermediate energy level, with the help of light energy. Fromthis level, the electrons are transferred to photosystem I for further energizationand utilization for biosynthetic reductions. In their passage from photosystem II tophotosystem I, the electrons suffer a partial energy fall coupled with ATP assembly(non-cyclic photophosphorylation).Interestingly, in the majority of autotrophic organisms, whether chemotrophicor phototrophic, the top energy boost whereby electrons are lifted to the levelfrom which they can serve to reduce carboxyl to carbonyl groups – mostly3-phosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde, as in reverse glycolysis – isaccomplished by a thioester-mediated mechanism (reversal of Reactions 10.3 and10.2), confirming the central importance of this mechanism.InformationBiological information circulates universally by means of three processes: replica-tion of DNA, transcription of DNA into RNA, and translation of RNA into protein.In addition, viruses with an RNA genome possess an enzyme that catalyzes oneof two processes that are not carried out by cells: replication of RNA and reversetranscription of RNA into DNA. These five processes are shown schematically inFigure10.1.These processes have two aspects, one involving energy, the other information.I will treat these two aspects separately.Biosynthetic mechanismsIn essence, biological information-transfer processes all rely on syntheses and, assuch, operate by the same kind of ATP-fueled mechanisms that carry out biosyn-theses in general. The synthesis of nucleic acids, which underlies all forms ofreplication and transcription, is special in that a single transfer reaction completesthe process. Mononucleotide groups (either dNMPs or NMPs) are transferred to the"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"10 How biofriendly is the universe?177DNA  RNA ProteinsTranscriptionTranslationReplicationReplicationReversetranscriptionDNARNA(viruses)Figure 10.1. Biological information transfers.3\u0005end of the growing polynucleotide chain from the corresponding dNTPs or NTPs,with release of inorganic pyrophosphate, which is hydrolyzed, thereby ensuring theirreversibility of the process.Protein assembly involves reactants carried by transfer RNAs (tRNAs). The bondlinking amino acids to tRNAs is created by a sequential group-transfer processin which ATP is split into AMP and inorganic pyrophosphate, which is furtherhydrolyzed, driving the reaction, as above. The two transfer steps of this processare catalyzed by a single enzyme, called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. The peptidebond itself is formed at the expense of the ATP-derived aminoacyl-tRNA bond bytransfer of the growing peptide chain from its tRNA carrier to the amino group ofatRNA-borne amino acid, yielding a peptide chain lengthened by one amino-acidunit and attached to the tRNA bearing the new amino acid. This reaction takesplace on the surface of ribosomes, which are small particles consisting of aboutfifty percent protein and fifty percent RNA (rRNAs). Interestingly, the peptidyltransferase that catalyzes the reaction is not a protein, but an rRNA. This is one ofthe rare known instances of involvement of a catalytic RNA, the only one in whichthe substrate is not an RNA molecule.TemplatesThe biosynthetic mechanisms mentioned differ from all others in being guided by atemplate molecule that dictates which building block is to be added at each step. Thistemplate molecule is invariably a nucleic acid, and the mechanism by which it exertsits control relies universally on base pairing, the phenomenon whereby adenine joinsspecifically with thymine or with uracil, and guanine joins likewise with cytosine.These relationships are summarized by the following cardinal relationships:A⇔TorU G⇔C(10.4)"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"178Christian de DuveIn the synthesis of nucleic acids, the template is a nucleic acid – of the same kindin replication, of opposite kind in transcription (see Figure10.1, above) – whichimposes, by base pairing, the nature of the mononucleotide to be added at eachstep. In protein assembly, the template is a messenger RNA molecule (mRNA),derived by transcription (eventually followed by splicing) from the DNA gene inwhich the sequence of the protein is encoded. The mRNA dictates, by successivebase triplets, or codons, the choice of the amino acid to be added at each step. Thisphenomenon is mediated by base pairing between the mRNA codons and com-plementary base triplets, or anticodons, present in the amino-acid-bearing tRNAs.Translation itself is carried out earlier by the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, whichensure, by their specificities, that amino acids and tRNAs are correctly matched.Exactly twenty varieties of such enzymes exist, one for each proteinogenic aminoacid.Base pairing also has an important structural function. It is responsible for thejoining of two complementary DNA chains (or, exceptionally, RNA, in certainviruses) into the celebrated double helix. It also causes single polynucleotide chains(mostly RNA) to bundle up into complex, three-dimensional arrangements. Thisproperty accounts for the many functions accomplished by RNA molecules, asopposed to DNA, which is essentially inert chemically and has as its sole functionsto serve as a repository of genetic information and as a template for the transfer ofthis information in replication and transcription.The genetic codeThe genetic code is the set of correspondences between amino acids and codons.In it, 61 of the 64 codons represent amino acids, with up to six codons standing forthe same amino acid; the remaining three codons serve as stop signals. With veryrare exceptions (in some mitochondria, for example, and in a few microorganisms),which arose late in evolution, the genetic code is the same for all living organ-isms. Workers have long puzzled about the relationships that underlie the code,which have been attributed to anything between a “frozen accident” and a set ofstrict, chemical complementarities between amino acids and codons or anticodons.The latest answer is that the genetic code is most likely the product of selectiveoptimization. The structure of the code is such that it minimizes the adverse con-sequences of mutations leading to the replacement of one base by another in acodon. As has long been pointed out, such changes often either do not alter thenature of the coded amino acid or replace it with an amino acid of similar phys-ical properties so that the mutant protein remains functional. Modeling experi-ments have shown the code to be close to optimal in this respect (Freelandet al.,2003)."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"10 How biofriendly is the universe?179HomochiralityThe amino acids used for protein synthesis are all, with the exception of glycine,which is not optically active, chiral molecules oflconfiguration. Similarly, DNAand RNA are made exclusively with thedisomers of their constitutive pentoses,deoxyribose and ribose, which happen to be levorotatory, like thel-amino acids.This peculiarity has been the object of much discussion and speculation. It is viewedby many as one of the most mysterious hallmarks of life.It should be noted first that the fact that only enantiomers of thesameopticalrotation sign are found in proteins and nucleic acids – the “homo” part of homochi-rality – may be viewed as a necessity, most probably a consequence of naturalselection. Protein molecules containing bothd-andl-amino acids, nucleic acidconstructed with the two enantiomers of the pentoses, would lack some of their keybiological properties. Life as we know it could not exist with heterochiral proteinsor nucleic acids. The alleged mystery thus concerns the chirality part, the actualnature of the enantiomers used:l-rather thand-amino acids, andd-rather thanl-pentoses.Much has been written on this topic. Relevant to the subject of this chapter isthe fact that there seems to be no compelling cosmic reason – there may be a localone – why life should use one or the other enantiomer. The possibility of life formssimilar to those we know, but functioning with proteins made ofd-amino acidsand with nucleic acids constructed withl-pentoses, is not ruled out in the presentstate of our knowledge. Whetherd-amino acids could be used withd-pentoses, orthe opposite, seems less likely if, as may well have been the case, steric interac-tions between the two kinds of molecule played an important role in the origin oflife.MembranesMembranes are indispensable biological constituents. No living cell can existwithout at least a peripheral membrane. In addition, many cells contain internal,membrane-bounded structures. Biological membranes consist universally of a lipidfabric within which a number of proteins are embedded.The fabric of membranesThe basic fabric of all membranes is the lipid bilayer, a bimolecular layer consistingof amphiphilic molecules typically made of a three-carbon core or skeleton to whichare attached, on one side, two long, hydrophobic chains made exclusively of carbonand hydrogen and, on the other, a hydrophilic head containing a variety of chemicalsubstances that share the property of being electrically charged or polarized:"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"180Christian de DuveCH3  CCH3  CC head(10.5)The three-carbon core of such molecules most often consists of glycerol, with thehydrophobic tails being made of long-chain fatty acids linked to glycerol by esterbonds – except in archaebacteria, where they are formed by isoprenoid alcoholslinked to glycerol (in the chiral configuration opposite to that shown in Scheme10.5 by ether bonds. Sphingolipids differ from this general scheme in that the long-chain aminoalcohol sphingosine provides both the core and the top hydrophobicchain, the second hydrophobic chain belonging to a long-chain fatty acid attachedto sphingosine by an amide bond.In phospholipids, which are the most important membrane lipids, the hydrophilichead consists of a negatively charged phosphate ester group, often esterified bysome positively charged nitrogenous, hydroxylated substance, such as choline,ethanolamine, or serine (which also carries an extra negative group). In glycolipids,avariety of carbohydrate compounds, occasionally associated with a negativelycharged acidic group (sialate or sulfate), make up the hydrophilic head.When mixed with water under certain conditions, molecules with the aboveconfiguration spontaneously organize into closed lipid bilayers. In this structure,two monomolecular layers join by their hydrophobic faces, creating an inner, oilyfilm, lined on both sides by the hydrophilic heads in contact with water inside andoutside the vesicle:waterwateroily film(10.6)Biological membranes owe a number of distinctive properties to the physical char-acteristics of the lipid bilayers with which they are constructed. One such property isflexibility. Because their constituent molecules can readily slide along one anotherin semi-fluid fashion, the films can adopt a wide variety of shapes, thus allowingmembranes to fold and mold themselves around almost any object.Another important property is self-sealing. Lipid bilayers and the membranesarising from them invariably exist in the form of closed sacs, or vesicles, withastrong, inherent tendency to adopt this shape. This ability accounts for the"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"10 How biofriendly is the universe?181spontaneous repair of pierced or injured membranes and for the various reorga-nization phenomena involved in the fission and fusion of vesicles that underliemany fundamental cellular processes, such as endocytosis, exocytosis, and vesicu-lar transport.In most membranes, the basic lipid bilayer fabric is enriched in various ways.The inner, fatty film of the bilayer often provides shelter for a number of hydropho-bic molecules, for example cholesterol, which is an obligatory constituent of theouter membrane of all eukaryotic cells. Most importantly, all biological membranescontain a variety of specialized proteins of crucial importance.Membrane proteinsProteins are able to associate with lipid bilayers because several of the aminoacids used for protein synthesis have hydrophobic groups. When a large enoughnumber of such amino acids are present close together in a given stretch of theprotein chain, they form a short, rod-shaped segment sufficiently hydrophobic tobe accommodated by the bilayer. If such a segment ends the chain, it serves asanchor, with the bulk of the molecule hanging from one or the other face of thebilayer. If a hydrophobic segment is situated inside a protein chain, it can form atransmembrane bridge, with the two parts of the molecule separated by the segmentprotruding on opposite faces of the bilayer. Finally, if, as is often the case, othersuch segments follow one another along the protein chain, the molecule will snakein and out across the bilayer, with both ends coming out on the same face or onopposite faces of the bilayer, depending on whether the number of hydrophobicsegments is even or odd.Membrane proteins have multiple functions. They comprise enzymes acting onlocally concentrated substrates; transport systems of various kinds, including theionic pumps responsible for bioelectric manifestations; translocators serving in thespecific delivery of proteins and other macromolecules across membranes; electron-transfer chains and other components of protonmotive machineries; photosystemsand their ancillary cofactors; and a variety of receptors involved in transmembranesignaling.CellsLife cannot exist without cells. The minimal cell contains, within a surroundingmembrane, a DNA genome, a complete machinery for replicating this genome andexpressing it by way of RNA and protein molecules, and a set of enzymes andcofactors capable of building the cell’s constituents from surrounding materialsand of deriving energy from the outside in a form suitable for the support of allthese activities."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"182Christian de DuvePresent in the simplest prokaryotes, these attributes are complemented by a vari-ety of additional properties in higher prokaryotes and, especially, in eukaryotic cells,which are distinguished by a fenced-off nucleus and by complex cytomembranestructures, cytoskeletal and motor elements, and endosymbiont-derived organelles.Akeyfeature of cells is the ability to multiply by division. Initiated by DNAreplication – and held in check as long as this process has not taken place – celldivision involves a number of steps, different in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, butleading in both to the splitting of the surrounding membrane into two distinct, closedmembranes, each enveloping a full copy of the genome and enough of all other cellcomponents to endow each daughter cell with autonomy. Relatively uncheckedin prokaryotes, which tend to multiply exponentially as long as enough usablematter and energy are available, cell division is subject to complex regulations ineukaryotic cells, especially those of multicellular organisms, in keeping with theindividual requirements and mutual relationships of tissues and organs. Cancer, asis known, is a major harmful consequence of a defect in this control.The requisites of lifeHaving reviewed the key features of life on earth, we are now ready to examinethe universe’s fitness for life. In addressing this question, I will limit myself tolife as we know it, ignoring the frequently evoked possibility of other life forms,differing from extant ones by the nature of their organic constituents and/or by themechanisms whereby they build their own substance, exploit environmental energysources, or handle information – and perhaps even constructed from elements otherthan CHNOPS. Such open-minded conjectures, which satisfy the commendableprinciple of “leaving no stone unturned,” have stimulated many valuable, theoreticalreflections on the nature of life and the kind of chemistry needed to support it. Inpractice, however, these conjectures have drawn attention mostly to the uniquefitness of present-day biochemistry as underpinning the main properties of life. Iwill not consider them further.Regarding fitness, an important distinction must be made between fitness toharbor life and fitness to generate life. The former question is to some extent trivial.Weknow from experience that life, once it has taken hold, can adapt to almostany kind of milieu, from freezing polar waters to superheated volcanic jets; fromswamps, lakes, and oceans to the deepest of rocks and the driest of deserts; fromalmost salt-free freshwaters to saturated brine; from pristine springs to the mostpolluted canals and other sites created by human technology; and across a widepH range, from biting acids to caustic alkalis. Considering the diversity and, insome cases, simplicity of the environments in which certain forms of life manageto thrive, one is tempted to believe that the universe has countless spots where somekind of living organism would be able to survive."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"10 How biofriendly is the universe?183Fitness to generate life, however, raises an entirely different question, whichcould be answered only if we knew how life actually originated. Although wedon’t know this, I will nevertheless attempt to address the question on the basisof what is known of the nature of life and what is suspected of its origin. Myaccount will be brief, and I again refer the reader to my previous publications foradditional information and bibliography (1991, 1995, 2002, 2005). In discussingthese requisites of life, I will follow the same order as in the first part of this chapter.Water and mineralsLiquid water is indispensable for life and must have been so for its origin as well.As far as is known, the universe contains plenty of water. The liquid state carrieswith it a more stringent condition in that its temperature range, although it varieswith pressure, remains relatively narrow. Considering the number and diversity ofplanets, moons, and other celestial bodies that presumably exist in the universe, thiscondition can hardly be forbidding. It seems most likely that many sitescapableofholding liquid water exist, in our galaxy and in others, and that at least a fractionof those actuallydocontain it. Even in our solar system, earth is probably not theonly such site. Liquid water may lie under the permafrost believed to cover partsof Mars and under the ice plates detected on the surface of Jupiter’s moon Europa.As to the various minerals associated with life, they are likely to be present insufficient amounts in many of the water-containing celestial bodies. It is signifi-cant, in this respect, that no element of atomic number higher than 34 is found inliving organisms, even in trace amounts. Up to that limit, elements are all relativelyabundant in many stars.Organic building blocksWhen, in 1953, Stanley Miller announced that he had observed the formation ofamino acids and other biological molecules “under possible primitive Earth con-ditions,” the scientific world (including the media) was thrilled by the possibil-ity, evoked by Miller’s historic experiments, that some of the building blocks oflifecouldhave arisen spontaneously on our planet. Surprisingly, nothing like theexcitement generated by Miller’s results or by those of his co-workers and follow-ers greeted the much more astonishing discovery that the building blocks of lifeactuallydoarise spontaneously in many parts of the cosmos.This is the startlingly significant message that extraterrestrial objects of variouskinds – interstellar dust particles, neighboring planets and their moons, comets, and,especially, meteorites – have divulged to high-resolution spectroscopic explorationsand to direct analyses using instruments borne by spacecraft or applied to materialsthat have fallen to earth. It is now known that a great variety of organic radicals and"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"184Christian de Duvemolecules exist in many extraterrestrial sites never visited by any living organism(for reviews, see Botta and Bada,2002; Ehrenfreundet al., 2002)Because of the extremely rarefied and cold conditions under which it operates,cosmic chemistry is nothing like the kind of chemistry we know. But it obeys thesame laws and, like organic chemistry on earth, exploits the unique associativeproperties of the carbon atom. Dominant among its products are small moleculesand radicals consisting of only a few atoms, short aliphatic hydrocarbons believed,for example, to form the seas observed on the surface of the Saturn moon Titan,the ubiquitous polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and fullerene-like polycarbonassociations. In addition, cosmic chemistry seems indiscriminately to make, inamounts that decrease with molecular size, most of the combinations that can arisefrom the radicals. These combinations include amino acids, nitrogenous bases,sugars, and other moderately sized molecules that are found in living organisms,but with no obvious bias in favor of those that serve as biological building blocksover those that do not. Chirality could be an exception, revealed by slight excessesofl- overd-amino acids in some meteoritic material. This matter is, however,still the object of much debate. The bias, to the extent that it exists, is most likelysecondary and due to asymmetric destruction rather than to synthesis.Much is still expected from this fruitful research field. Particularly encouragingis the possibility of reproducing in the laboratory some of the events that take placein outer space. Two distinct groups, one American (Bernsteinet al., 2002) and theother European (Mu ̃noz Caroet al., 2002), have investigated the effects of ultravioletirradiation, under about the lowest temperature and highest vacuum conditionsattainable, on simulated interstellar ice analogs containing water, methanol, andammonia as the main components with the addition of cyanide in the first researchproject and carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in the other. Both groups haveobserved the formation of a variety of organic compounds, including a number ofamino acids.It is generally accepted that products of cosmic chemistry were showered onthe nascent earth and could likewise fall on many other celestial bodies, broughtdown by comets, meteorites, and cosmic dust. But there is no agreement on thecontribution of such products to the origin of life. Some researchers believe that thebulk of the building blocks of life came from outer space, others that they arose inthe primitive terrestrial atmosphere by the kinds of process Miller and others havetried to reproduce in the laboratory. Most likely, both sources contributed, but inproportions that remain to be evaluated.Faced with these facts, one is obviously tempted to assume that the productsof cosmic/terrestrial chemistry did, in reality, serve as the building blocks fromwhich life first arose. This view is not unanimously accepted. At least two promi-nent investigators, the German G ̈unter W ̈achtersh ̈auser (1998) and the American"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"10 How biofriendly is the universe?185Harold Morowitz (1999; Chapter18, this volume), have vigorously defended thetheory that life started from scratch in autotrophic fashion. Their proposed schemesdiffer, but have in common that they attribute a central role to a reverse, reductiveKrebs cycle, from which the first amino acids would have arisen by amination ofcertain intermediates. A recent cladistic analysis has, however, led to the oppositeconclusion that Krebs-cycle intermediates arose from amino acids by deamination(Cunchillos and Lecointre,2002).On the whole, it would be very surprising if cosmic chemistry had nothing to dowith the development of biochemistry. Attributing the many similarities between thetwo chemistries to a meaningless coincidence strains the boundaries of credibility.If we accept the more plausible view, then the main message of all these discoveries,from the point of view of our discussions, isthat the chemical “seeds” of life arepresent throughout the cosmos. This, as far as I know, is the strongest argument yetuncovered in favor of a “biofriendly” universe.CatalysisChemical “seeds” are a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for the developmentof life. For the seeds to “germinate,” that is, for the building blocks to join intoproteins, nucleic acids, and other key biological constituents, suitable catalysts areindispensable. What is true of present-day life no doubt also applies to emerginglife, which, however, could not have had available the enzymes, ribozymes, andcoenzymes that are at work today.Many investigators have searched the mineral world for possible catalysts ofbiogenic reactions. Suggestive results have been obtained with metal ions, zincfor example (Lohrmannet al., 1980), clays (Cairns-Smith,1982; Ferris,1998),double-layer metal hydroxide minerals (Pitschet al., 1995), pyrite (W ̈achtersh ̈auser,1998), and iron–sulfur complexes (Cammack,1983;W ̈achtersh ̈auser,1998). Towhat extent such materials may have been crucial to the origin of life on earth is,however, not known. In addition, doubts have often been expressed that mineralcatalysts could, alone, have sufficed to launch life.Much attention has therefore been given to the suggestion that ribozymes mayhave played a key role in the origin of life in the so-called RNA world (Gilbert,1986).There are, indeed, strong reasons that favor this possibility. Protein synthesis, forexample, almost certainly was developed by interacting RNA molecules. But RNAitself can obviously not have catalyzed its own synthesis nor all the protometabolicreactions that came before it.Foranumber of years, I have advocated the view that the first catalysts were shortpeptides and related compounds that I have called “multimers” (1991). Differentfrom proteins, which they are supposed to have preceded, these substances could"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"186Christian de Duvehave containedd-aswell asl-amino acids, some not found in proteins, togetherwith other components, such as hydroxyacids, resembling in this respect a vastgroup of natural substances of bacterial and fungal origin. Known as non-ribosomalpeptides and polyketides, these substances include a number of antibiotics and otherbiologically active molecules and have in common that they are synthesized by wayof the thioesters of their precursor acids (Cane,1997;Walsh,2004).As I have pointed out, substances of this kind would be most likely, becauseof chemical similarities, to mimic, be it only in rudimentary fashion, some of thecatalytic properties of protein enzymes. Such properties have not been describedin natural substances, but they could be looked for, both in natural and in artifi-cial compounds (de Duve,2003). Furthermore, the possibility that such substancescould have arisen spontaneously in a prebiotic setting is plausible. Made of build-ing blocks that are abundant among the primary products of cosmic chemistry,the posited multimers could have formed by fairly simple assembly mechanisms,which could even, like their natural counterparts, have involved thioester precur-sors. As discovered by Wieland even before the biological role of thioesters cameto be known, peptides can form spontaneously from the thioesters of amino acids(see survey by Wieland,1988). Several other investigators have described the syn-thesis of peptides under plausible prebiotic conditions (see, for example, Huberand W ̈achtersh ̈auser,1998). Particularly interesting are the experiments by a groupof Japanese workers that have observed amino acid oligomerization in a hot–coldflow reactor designed to simulate a hydrothermal vent (Imaiet al., 1999;Ogataet al., 2000;Yokoyamaet al., 2003). This point, together with the hypotheticalinvolvement of thioesters, is of interest with respect to the possibility that life mayhave started in a volcanic setting (see below).Substances resembling my multimers could even be formed by cosmic chemistry.There is evidence of the presence of peptides in meteorites, although apparentlylimited to the simple dipeptide glycyl–glycine (Shimoyama and Ogasawara,2002).In the simulation experiments reported above (Bernsteinet al., 2002; Mu ̃noz Caroet al., 2002), free amino acids were obtained in substantial amounts in the productsof UV-irradiated interstellar ice analogs only if the material had first been subjectedto acid hydrolysis. The possibility that the amino acids may be present in theform of peptides is explicitly raised by the investigators. It is thus conceivablethat peptides and analogous substances accompanied basic building blocks in thecometary showers that are suspected of having delivered chemical seeds of life tothe prebiotic earth.EnergyAny consideration of the energetic underpinning of emerging life must allow acrucial role to ATP and the other NTPs, especially since these compounds also"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"10 How biofriendly is the universe?187serve to make RNA, most likely the first biological information-bearing substance(see below). It is interesting and possibly significant that inorganic pyrophosphatesubstitutes for ATP in a few metabolic reactions today. These reactions have beenstudied in particular detail by the Swedish couple Margaret and Herrick Baltscheff-sky (1992), who believe them to go back to a “pyrophosphate world,” a hypotheti-cal early stage in the origin of life in which inorganic pyrophosphate was the firstbearer of high-energy phosphate bonds. As mentioned above, another inorganicpyrophosphate derivative, polyphosphate, serves as a reservoir of such bonds incertain bacteria.If inorganic pyrophosphates were essential to the development of life, this factwould put a severe constraint on the type of site where life could start, as pyrophos-phates are very rare in the mineral world. Almost the only place where they mightbe expected to be present is a hot, volcanic setting (pyrmeans fire in Greek), wherethey could arise from inorganic phosphates and have indeed been detected in oneinstance (Yamagataet al., 1991).Whatever the role of inorganic pyrophosphate, an early development of theorganic moieties of NTPs is mandated by the participation of these molecules inRNA synthesis. This problem is still largely unsolved, even though it has engageda considerable amount of research. Ribose and the various purine and pyrimidinebases that make up natural nucleosides can all arise by relatively simple reactions.Some of these substances could even be among the products of cosmic chem-istry, having been detected in trace amounts in meteoritic materials. What remainsunknown, however, is how these molecules joined into nucleosides, were phospho-rylated, and, especially, emerged to occupy the central position they hold in thescheme of life. It is possible that subsequent selection, at the RNA level, rather thanspecific chemistry, was responsible for this emergence (de Duve,2002, 2005).Thioesters are another group of substances that could have played a key rolein primitive energy transactions. We have seen how these substances are uniquelyinvolved in both group and electron transfers and in phosphorylation processesthat are associated with some of the most primordial metabolic reactions and donot, unlike those dependent on protonmotive force, require complex membrane-embedded systems. We have also seen how my hypothetical multimers could havearisen from the thioesters of amino acids (see above). These facts and others haveled to my proposal of a “thioester world” (1998).Thioesters form by condensation between organic acids, which are typical prod-ucts of cosmic chemistry, and thiols, which are organic derivatives of hydrogensulfide (H2S), a characteristic component of volcanic fumes. Here, therefore, is yetanother hint of a volcanic cradle of life.These considerations raise the question of the actual source of energy wherebynascent life was fueled. Volcanic heat, by way of pyrophosphates and, perhaps,thioesters, is a possible source, although not likely to have, by itself, supported the"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"188Christian de Duveentire development of life. Light, which supports most of the biosphere today, hasoften been envisaged, but does not, in my opinion, qualify as a primitive sourceof energy. Its utilization depends on complex membrane-linked systems and, espe-cially, requires the ability to continue functioning in periods of darkness. Today,unilluminated phototrophs subsist on their reserves and, if need be, on their ownsubstance, by coupled electron-transfer mechanisms similar to those used by het-erotrophs. Most likely, therefore, some primitive electron-transfer reactions werealready involved at an early stage, perhaps connecting thioesters and pyrophos-phates in a manner presaging today’s substrate-level phosphorylations. If so, whatwere the participants in these early transactions and how do they relate to the natureof the relevant environment?This question is unresolved. When Miller designed his celebrated experiments,he was much influenced by the theory of his mentor, Harold Urey, who believedthe atmosphere of the early earth to have been strongly reducing. This theory has,however, since fallen into disfavor, throwing doubt on the validity of Miller’s results,especially since similar experiments performed with a neutral atmosphere yieldednegligible quantities of organic material. The controversy is not yet resolved, butit may become irrelevant if cosmic synthesis, rather than atmospheric formation,should turn out to be the main source of life’s building blocks. In such an event,oxidative conditions, rather than reducing ones, would be called for to support thefirst electron-transfer reactions, with preformed building blocks serving as electrondonors.Although molecular oxygen was most likely absent on the prebiotic earth, therewas probably no dearth of potential electron acceptors in the mineral world at thetime. Sulfate and its reduction product, sulfite, which serve as electron acceptorsfor some bacteria, are possible acceptors. This is an attractive possibility becausesulfite is a common component of volcanic fumes, and its reduction could haveyielded hydrogen sulfide.The matter must remain open, however, since, as mentioned above, some inves-tigators do not believe that early life was fed by products of cosmic chemistry,but propose instead an autotrophic origin of life, thus reinstating the hypothesisof a reducing milieu. In the scheme devised by W ̈achtersh ̈auser (1998), the nec-essary electrons are assumed to be supplied by sulfide ions (S2−) condensing intodisulfide (S2−2). Ferrous iron is taken to drive this reaction thermodynamically byprecipitating the disulfide formed into the highly insoluble FeS2constituent of themineral pyrite, which is also supposed to provide a catalytic surface for the reaction.Experiments have indeed shown that this process can support certain reductions.Interestingly, this “iron–sulfur world,” which combines two major participants ofbiological electron transfers in a suggestive fashion, also presupposes a volcanicsetting."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"10 How biofriendly is the universe?189In recent years, the “hot-cradle” theory has been boosted by the discovery of deep-sea hydrothermal vents and of the many strange forms of life that inhabit those darkand seemingly inhospitable recesses. It has been argued against this theory that thefragility of many of the constituents of life precludes a hot environment and evenmandates freezing temperatures (Miller and Bada,1988). The fact remains thatsome organisms thrive at temperatures as high as 110◦C. Also, one would expectprimitive forms of life to be more robust than their more sophisticated descendants.Certainly, the traces pointing to a volcanic birthplace apparently left in life’s mostfundamental processes cannot be lightly disregarded.InformationInformation most probably entered nascent life with the appearance of RNA. Oneneed only look at Figure10.1to realize that DNA can be dispensed with providedthat RNA can be replicated. In such a DNA-free “RNA world,” RNA would haveserved both as the repository of genetic information and as the agent of the expres-sion of this information, first by itself and later by way of its protein translationproducts. On the other hand, the key functions carried out by RNA molecules inprotein synthesis indicate strongly that proteins – defined as special polypeptidesmade with a distinct set of twenty amino acids – are an “invention” of RNA. It hasbeen proposed, because of the molecular complexity of RNA, that this substancemay itself have been preceded by some simpler information-bearing molecule. Thishypothesis, however, is unsupported by any evidence.The problem of RNA formation is achemicalproblem. This point is of cardinalimportance. The first RNA molecules were the products, probably together with anumber of similar compounds, of the early chemistry whereby life was launched;they were not “intended” to serve as information carriers. It was their unique basecomposition that, by lending itself to pairing, probably allowed their specific repli-cation and amplification, which, in turn, caused them to emerge and to be moldedby selection into the first bearers of genetic information and into the first catalystsof protein synthesis, as well as, perhaps, of other processes (de Duve,2005).In light of these considerations, it would seem that the main requirements for theappearance of RNA were the conditions, already briefly referred to, that allowed theformation of its NTP precursors, presumably in connection with primitive energytransfers. Two restrictions may be added. First, there is the problem of assembly,which probably required a special catalyst (possibly later supplemented by RNAmolecules). Furthermore, there is the need for sufficient stability of the assembledmolecules. RNA is a fragile substance, especially in an alkaline medium. Thus, acertain degree of acidity may be another quality to be added to our reconstructionof the cradle of life. This point is of interest as adaptation to media of increasing"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"190Christian de Duveacidity may have played a role in the development of protonmotive force (de Duve,1991).MembranesBiological membranes, as we have seen, are constructed on lipid bilayers. Whatwere the first amphiphilic molecules capable of associating into bilayers, and howdid they arise?There are several possibilities. As found by the American investigator DavidDeamer (1998), small amounts of molecules capable of assembling into bilayers,probably medium-length fatty acids, can be extracted from meteorites, suggestinga possible cosmic origin of the first amphiphilic molecules.Another possibility is that the first membranes arose from phospholipid-likemolecules produced by primitive metabolism. Phosphate, with or without additionalcomponents, could have provided the hydrophilic heads of the molecules. As to theirhydrophobic tails, the French chemist Guy Ourisson has built a strong case in favorof polyisoprenoid molecules, the building blocks of ether lipids, as opposed to long-chain fatty acids, the main constituents of ester lipids (see Ourisson and Nakatani,1994; Chapter19, this volume). In nature, isoprenoid chains arise from isopentenylpyrophosphate, a relatively simple precursor.Finally, the possible intervention of hydrophobic peptides or other multimers(de Duve,1991) may deserve consideration, as they might have provided the poresneeded for exchanges of matter across the membranes, to be replaced later byproteins.Amphiphilic molecules with sufficiently bulky tails readily assemble into vesicu-lar lipid bilayers. A whole industry has been built around the production of artificialvesicles of this kind, or liposomes, which are widely used in the cosmetic and drugindustries. A condition for the formation of liposomes is vigorous mechanical agi-tation, which is generally provided by ultrasound. Thus, we may add agitation toour reconstruction of the cradle of life. Pressured jets, such as those that make uphydrothermal vents, could possibly create the necessary turbulence.CellsWhether life started with the formation of vesicular structures or became encap-sulated at a later stage is still a matter of much debate. What seems likely is thatsome kind of protocells already existed by the time RNA appeared. This contentionis based on the assumption, which looks reasonable, that the RNA molecules thatlaunched the “RNA world” and developed protein synthesis must have emergedby Darwinian selection. A direct selection process, based on the stability and"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"10 How biofriendly is the universe?191replicability of the molecules themselves, could conceivably have accounted forthe early stages of this evolution. But soon, an indirect process, based on the use-fulness of the RNA molecules or of their protein products, must perforce havebeen at work. Competing protocells capable of multiplication are an indispensablecondition of such a selective process.As seen in the preceding subsection, some kind of vesicular structure couldhave formed spontaneously by agitation as soon as the appropriate amphiphilicmolecules were present. But vesicles are not necessarily cells. Two supplementaryconditions, at least, had to be fulfilled. First, the membranes bounding the protocellsmust have had permeability properties such as to keep functional components insidewhile allowing incoming foodstuffs and exiting waste products to pass through. Inaddition, the protocells must have been capable of growth and division if they wereto participate in a process of Darwinian selection.How such conditions were fulfilled is not known. In terms of environment,they imply the existence of a milieu capable of accommodating a large number ofprotocells, of providing them with necessary nutrients, and of disposing of theirwaste. The calmer surroundings of hydrothermal vents could conceivably haveprovided such a milieu.DiscussionIn dealing with the question “How biofriendly is the universe?” I have intentionallyrestricted my analysis to life and the universe as we know them. Conjecturing onpossible forms of life obeying a different kind of chemistry seems to me absurd in theabsence of any sign that they exist or any hint of the kind of chemistry on which theycould be based. Similarly, speculating on other possible universes as backgroundfor an appreciation of the “fine-tuning” and “anthropic” qualities of the one weinhabit is beyond my competence and must be left to physicists, who have given itabundant attention. Within these self-imposed limits, I have addressed the problemmainly in the light of biochemistry, which is now understood in considerable detail,and of what is known or suspected about the origin of life, a topic still in its infancybutsubject to intensive research.The chemical seeds of lifeWhat is probably the most significant and revealing lesson emerging from thepreceding survey comes from outer space: the chemistry of life is written into thatof the cosmos. It has long been recognized that living organisms are built with themost abundant elements. Recent findings have now shown that this biofriendlinessextends from atoms to molecules. Organic chemistry, far from being an exclusive"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"192Christian de Duveprerogative of living organisms, as its name was intended to signify, is universal.Moreover, some of the products of cosmic chemistry are identical or closely similarto the most central building blocks of life. Chemical seeds of life arise spontaneouslyin outer space and on many celestial objects.It is difficult to attribute this fact to a meaningless coincidence. This, however,is what one would have to believe if, as some researchers maintain, life developedin autotrophic fashion from carbon dioxide and very small building blocks, andnot from preformed organic molecules (see above). The problem remains openbecause autotrophy obviously did develop at some stage by mechanisms that must beaccounted for. On the other hand, the evidence is very strong that our young planet –or whatever site harbored the origin of earth life – must have been abundantlysupplied with amino acids and other biogenic substances delivered by comets,meteorites, and cosmic dust. It seems highly likely that these substances participatedsignificantly in the development of life, whatever the contribution of local syntheses.The cradle of lifeSeeds can germinate only in fertile soil. Thus, if, as appears likely, cosmic chemistrydid play a role in the origin of life on earth, the key question facing us is: howfrequent, or infrequent, in the universe are the conditions that allowed the productsof cosmic chemistry to become fruitfully involved in the generation of living cells?Our knowledge on this topic is still very scanty. All we have are a few indicationsthat life may have originated in a volcanic milieu, perhaps one resembling present-day hydrothermal vents. What seems to be needed, therefore, according to thisreconstruction of the cradle of life, is a rocky body containing a magmatic core,pockets of liquid water, and, in between, a fissured crust allowing water to seepthrough the cracks and resurge in the form of pressured, turbulent, overheated,acidic, sulfurous, metal-laden jets. If this reconstruction is correct, the questionraised reduces to estimating the probability of celestial objects elsewhere in theuniverse that are likely to harbor hydrothermal vents physically and chemicallysimilar to those found on earth.This question is obviously unanswerable in the present state of our knowledge.In any case, it is not for the biologist to answer. All that can be said is that the presentdirection of astronomical research favors multiplicity rather than uniqueness. It isalready known that planetary systems are far from rare. It is true that only largeplanets orbiting close to their sun have been detected so far, but this is because oftechnical limitations that may well be overcome by the advances of tomorrow. Theexistence of earth-like planets is not excluded; it is seen as likely by many experts.The very real possibility remains, however, that our reconstruction of the cradleof life is incomplete and that some special condition not included in our assessment"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"10 How biofriendly is the universe?193has to be fulfilled for life to arise. Perhaps the magnetic field must be just right. Orthe planet’s orbit must have the right degree of ellipticity, its rotation axis the righttilt. Or there may be a need for a moon of just the right mass circling at just the rightdistance. With enough rare conditions to be satisfied, planet earth could indeed turnout to be unique in the entire universe, a “cosmic fluke” (Conway Morris,2003).On the whole, sheer numbers would seem to argue against rarity. Consideringthe number of sunlike stars believed to exist in our galaxy (on the order of thirtybillion) and the estimated number of galaxies in the universe (about one hundredbillion), the odds seem to favor the existence of multiple earth-like planets capableof giving rise to life. Even some defenders of a “rare earth” share this opinion (Wardand Brownlee,2000).The probability of lifeSticking to our metaphor, what we have seen so far is that the chemical seeds oflife are universally available and that the kind of soil in which the seeds germinatedto give rise to present-day life probably exists in other sites in the universe. Onequestion remains: how probable is it that germination will succeed when the seedsfall on the right soil? In other words, given the building blocks and the appropriateenvironmental conditions, what is the probability that viable cells will actuallyemerge?In considering this question, elsewhere I have vigorously defended the viewthat life was virtually bound to arise under the conditions that prevailed at thesite of its birth (1995, 2002, 2005). This opinion rests mainly on the fact thatlife must have arisen by chemical processes and that chemistry deals with highlydeterministic, reproducible mechanisms. To be sure, contingency became added tochemical determinism when replicable molecules, most likely RNA, began to bemade. This phenomenon introduced continuity into the course of events, but, also,the risk of its accidental loss by mutation. Many researchers have emphasized thechancy nature of such developments.As I have pointed out on a number of occasions, the intervention of chance doesnot necessarily exclude inevitability. What counts is the number of opportunitiesavailable for the occurrence of a given event, as compared with the probability ofthat event. Many instances indicate that, when faced with a large number of distinctchance opportunities, nascent life enjoyed the freedom of exploring the range ofpossibilities extensively enough to approach selective optimization. Many of the“hallmarks” singled out in the first part of this chapter may have been the outcomeof such a process (de Duve,2005).Admittedly, the possibility cannot be ruled out that some rare substance orsome improbable chance occurrence played a decisive, non-reproducible role in"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"194Christian de Duvethe appearance of life. Scientific caution commands such reservation, but commonsense argues against it. One doesn’t readily see how a complex network of intercon-nected chemical reactions, such as those that must have initiated life, could haverested critically on a single, improbable chance factor. Such a caveat looks morelike anad hochypothesis than like a reasonable conjecture.Nevertheless, the fact remains that attempts at reproducing key events leading tothe development of life in the laboratory have met with little success so far. We stillhave no inkling, for example, of how such central compounds as ATP and the otherNTPs may have arisen. Achieving the synthesis of these substances under plausibleprebiotic conditions would go far toward accrediting the deterministic theory. Untilthis happens, the question stays open. In this connection, the indications gathered onthe possible conditions under which life arose may be useful guides in the design ofexperiments. We have seen that this approach has already yielded some interestingresults. Success could also depend critically on finding the right catalysts amongpossible mineral components of the prebiotic environment or, more likely, amongthe organic products of primitive chemistry (de Duve,2003).All these uncertainties would be dispelled if clear evidence of extraterrestriallife could be obtained. Even then, kinship with earth life would have to be ruledout. Discovering life on Mars, for example, might not be decisive in itself. It is notconsidered impossible that Martian life could originate from earth, or terrestrial lifefrom Mars, or both from some third site in the solar system. The two forms of lifewould have to differ in a significant way, for example in the chirality of some keyconstituent, for their independent origin to be incontrovertibly established.The concerted effort that is going on at present in the new discipline of astrobi-ology, sometimes also called exobiology or bioastronomy – a discipline with threenames but no known object! – will perhaps lead to the discovery of extraterrestriallife some time in the future. If it does not, however, all one will be able to state isthat life is not extremely frequent. Finding no sign of life in the minuscule part ofthe cosmos accessible to our explorations in no way can serve as proof of the rarityof life, let alone its uniqueness.ConclusionIn conclusion, we live in a biofriendly universe; but just how biofriendly is notprecisely known. Therefore, the only scientifically valid attitude with respect to thequestion is prudent agnosticism. If, however, some hypothesis is to be favored, asa guide for experimentation, for example, or as a justification for research funding,or, perhaps more importantly, as an inspiration for one’s world view, availableclues support the assumption that our universe is such that generation of life wasobligatory, probably in many sites and at many times.

Each is, in its respectiveway, constrained by a whole series of physical and chemical factors. One of the mostobvious aspects is the fluid environment in which they live, albeit at scales that inbeing separated by about eight orders of magnitude are determinative of radicallydifferent behaviors. The bacterium’s world is submillimetric, and accordingly itis dominated by constraints of viscosity. Motion involves the remarkable methodof flagellar propulsion (the nearest thing to a wheel in biology; see, for example,Berg,2003). When its flagella stop beating, the bacterium ceases its movement ina distance equivalent to the diameter of a hydrogen atom. The humpback whale, bycontrast, occupies a liquid environment with which we are somewhat more familiar,although our swimming ability is feeble compared with the whale’s oceanic travelrange of thousands of kilometers. Fully aquatic, the humpback occupies a worldthat to us is both alien, with its complex system of echolocation, and familiar, withits ability to communicate – which includes singing.Despite such wide divergences, the basic point of commonality is that both bac-teria and whales live in environments where the physical controls imposed by thephysico-chemical properties of water – be they viscosity or acoustic transmission –predetermine what is biologically possible. To this simple example could be addedmany other physical and chemical constraints. In the case of water – echoingLawrence Henderson’s (1913) prescient remarks on the way in which the physico-chemical glove matches the hand of life – one could list such factors as its power as asolvent, dielectric properties, transparency, latent heat of evaporation, and decreaseof density when frozen. These properties are all central in various ways to lifeFitness of the Cosmos for Life: Biochemistry and Fine-Tuning,ed. J. D.

Otherexamples, such as the strength of the carbon–carbon bond or the central role ofphosphorus in biochemistry (Westheimer,1987), will be familiar as properties thatare essential to life. Putative alternatives are difficult to imagine.Physicochemical factors in various ways necessarily predetermine what organ-isms can and cannot achieve, and they therefore delimit the habitable “box” of allbiological possibilities. Biologists, of course, freely acknowledge that form andfunction are intimately connected to the prevailing physicochemical constraints ofthe real world. Yet typically they would exhibit restraint from making anything butthe broadest predictions about how life might turn out on some other, earth-likeplanet – or indeed how the history of life might unfold if, by some miraculous inter-vention, the clock were reset to the time of the Cambrian “explosion” or earlier. Inthe common view, we might have flight, but not insects; maybe heterotrophs, but notfungi (let alone mushrooms); maybe animals, but not intelligent arborealists. Is thisview of generic contingency warranted? If physico-chemical factors substantiallyconstrain possibilities, might they not also constrain and predetermine evolutionarytendencies and trajectories?General patterns?The purpose of this review is two-fold. First, it is to question the prevailing belief(or, if the reader prefers, paradigm) that evolution has effectively no predictabilities,let alone destinations. This is an issue reviewed at some length in my bookLife’sSolution(Conway Morris,2003). Here I particularly want to explore issues I dealtwith there only cursorily, or not at all, not least because new information has sincebecome available. A second purpose of direct relevance to the theme of this volumeis to ask (if only in outline) what some of the basic and necessary physicochemicalunderpinnings of life might be. To reiterate Henderson’s phrase, the question athand is what physico-chemical factors might contribute to the fitness of life itself.These two questions are interrelated. Ultimately we would like to be able todetermine, on the basis of some common framework, the probability that sentientlife forms would emerge that could formulate the very questions posed here. Tobegin to address this area, we must acknowledge that while the organization oflife is hierarchical (protein chemists and evolutionary sociologists seldom attendone another’s meetings, perhaps regrettably), we have little understanding of (butplenty of speculation about) how organic complexities emerge and what their keypredeterminants are. So, too, as addressed later in this chapter, we need to askwhether a particular evolutionary pathway critically depends on a given innovation.This is not to say that a particular biological property (say ion channels, elasticproteins, or multicellularity) cannot be understood in an evolutionary context. Far"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"11 Tuning into the frequencies of life199from it. The point to note is that our descriptions are specific to the instance inquestion. We are not yet capable of addressing general principles of constraint anddirectionality within a coherent scientific framework.Another largely unacknowledged tension within evolutionary biology is betweenhistorical perspectives and the desire to establish general principles, if not laws. Theformer aspect often remains implicit, not least in much of the biochemical and phys-iological literature. Evolutionary divergences (or, for that matter, convergences) bydefinition must follow historical pathways. Unsurprisingly, this historical dimen-sion has encouraged interest in contingent events, most famously in the example oftreating the Cretaceous–Tertiary (K/T) impact as a roll of the dice, setting evolutionin a new direction. Such a focus of attention, arguing for a diversion or derailingof evolutionary trajectories, naturally undermines the search for general principlesin biology. In this regard, the discipline remains notoriously refractory. Indeed, itslack of a law-like framework has led to the clich ́eofdistinguishing physics (andchemistry) as “hard” and biology (and geology) as “soft.” The search for generalprinciples remains, therefore, a perennial challenge. In this context, important recentcontributions toward the possibility of general “laws” include discussions of suchtopics as: (i) allometric scaling in organisms (see, for example, Westet al., 1999;Savageet al., 2004;but see Kozlowski and Konarzewski,2004); (ii) ontogeneticgrowth (Westet al., 2001); (iii) movement and locomotion (Marden and Allen,2002;Tayloret al., 2003; Hedenstr ̈om,2004; Linden and Turner,2004); and, froma different perspective, (iv) latitudinal diversity gradients (Hillebrand,2004).Stumbling blocks in evolutionOne indication of the potential difficulties in comprehending the fundamentaldynamics of evolution is those instances where research areas seemingly havefailed. Such conclusions may seem harsh and in no way are meant to denigrate ordismiss the enormous intellectual and scientific effort given to such topics. Never-theless, the list is interesting, and among those that come most straightforwardly tomind are the origin(s) of life, artificial intelligence, and artificial life.Each in its own way thus far has failed to match its initial sense of scientificpromise. Notably, in the cases of the origin of life (see, for example, Dose,1988)and in the quest to generate artificial intelligence (see Horgan,1997), for decades therespective communities have been claiming to be on the edge of significant break-throughs. Problems, however, have turned out to be far more difficult than initiallyexpected. In the case of the origin of life, it is not clear what physico-chemicalsystem now holds the greatest promise for further progress. Hydrothermal ventanalogs (see, for example, Codyet al., 2000; Lebrunet al., 2003) seem potentiallyvery interesting, not least because of their possible occurrence on early Mars and"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"200Simon Conway Morrispresent-day Europa. But at a basic scientific level of insight, it is far from clear whyany particular set of experiments, synthesizing one set of simple organic moleculesand defining one set of protometabolic pathways, should be any more likely tolead to deep illumination compared with other sets of experiments that follow dif-ferent hunches and hopes. Perhaps more progress has taken place in the case ofcomputational artificial intelligence, but ambitions toward the emergence of artifi-cial machine sentience seem to be as remote as ever. To be sure, anotherin silicoventure, that of artificial life, where a computer program allows entities in a “vir-tual world” to “evolve” from a starting point of unremarkable conditions, certainlyseems an important and fruitful area of investigation (see, for example, Lenskiet al., 2003). However, I am struck by how uninteresting the end results tend to bewhen compared with the concrete products of real evolution, constructed as theyare out of the full toolbox of nature and not just purely mathematical proceduresdigitally instantiated.A simple reply would be that these model systems were never meant to representthe real world. This point certainly has force in the case of artificial life, althoughthe question remains how successful the approach will be in helping to decidewhether the biological world we know is largely contingently accidental or, as Iargueab initio,ismore strongly predictable. The point, in summary, is that we havecontinuing debates over the possible existence of general theoretical perspectivessuch as might address questions about degrees of contingency and directionality, butat present we do not yet have what might form a fundamental theory of evolution.In the remainder of this chapter, one of my purposes is to explore a series ofrelated points concerning the emergence of biologically complex forms. Note thatwhen discussing these points the underlying themes of “fine-tuning” and “fitnessof the environment” are not neglected in considering the emergence, continuation,diversification, and irreversible increase of complexity of biological organizationsover protracted intervals of geological time. This view of life raises two addi-tional questions: (1) Do ultimate limits to the process of evolutionary diversificationexist? and (2) Insofar as physicochemical fine-tuning and fitness of the environ-ment are effectively universal properties (see also de Duve,1995), to what degreewould the evolution of life on earth carry specific expectations and implications forexobiology?Chemical underpinningsThat life is chemically based is beyond dispute, and any attempt to revivify avitalistic program in terms of an ́elan vitalis doomed to failure. Williams and Fra ́ustoda Silva (2003)have gone on to argue that thermodynamics and the rules of chemicalassembly impart a strong directionality to evolution. From the point of view of the"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"11 Tuning into the frequencies of life201organism, they argue that the principal constraints revolve around the nature ofintracellular reductive chemistry, the challenge of oxygen, and the advantages ofcooperative interactions in the context of ecosystems. They further suggest that theseconstraints led to “changes [that] were in an inevitable progression, and were not justdue to blind chance” (p. 323). This claim surely implies that even to a backgroundof mutational or other Darwinian change there remained “a fixed overall route.” Inthe context of “fitness of the environment,” the Williams–Fra ́usto da Silva paperis, therefore, exceptionally important in its claim that the “overall activity of the[blind] watchmaker was constrained by the nature of changing chemicals and thethermodynamic equilibrium conditions of the environment” so that “[l]ife was in aphysical tunnel and there was only one way to go” (p. 335). Hence, Williams andFra ́usto da Silva suggest that not only was the emergence of eukaryotes inevitable,butsoalso was the evolution of plants and animals. Their paper does not, however,make claims for particular organismal specificities. Although it seems to be implicitin their analysis that humans are also a logical outcome of this process, nowheredo they state that such an evolutionary outcome is inevitable. Nor, I hasten to add,would I necessarily expect them to address this topic. To reiterate, their argumentsare effectively chemical and thermodynamic.What, then, might be the basis for a road map of evolution? I will start with theassumption that all life is carbaquist, thus doubly dependent on the properties ofwater (Henderson,1913) and on the ability of carbon to form both flexible chainsand chemical bonds. Liquid ethane as an alternative solvent and silicon-based lifeforms are among the alternatives, but appear to suffer significant drawbacks. Solife, perhaps all life, originates as carbaquist; but for the time being, locations onany map involving the origin of life might as well be labeled “Here be dragons”(see also Conway Morris,2003). My hunch is that the chemical pathway to lifewill turn out to be extraordinarily specific, involving the customary “happy co-incidences.” At present, however, the diversity of experimental approaches is aclear indication that both the process and place of assembly remain highly spec-ulative. Difficulties in understanding the origin of life are all the more puzzlingbecause of evidence that the basic parameters presumed to be essential in the initi-ation of this process are probably universal. In part, the idea of such “universality”follows because of the ease of synthesis of many of the principal building blocksof life. Detection of amino acids, nucleic acids (or precursors), and hydrocarbonsin carbonaceous meteorites also suggests that carbon chemistry probably is themolecular substrate on which all life sits. So far as the amino acids are concerned,one estimate is that approximately three-quarters of those found in terrestrial lifewould have extraterrestrial counterparts (Weber and Miller,1981).So too in his research program looking at the so-called etiology of DNA, theteam led by Albert Eschenmoser (1999) shows that few alternatives match the"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"202Simon Conway Morriseffectiveness of DNA itself. Nevertheless, it is worth remembering three implica-tions of this research program: (i) as Eschenmoser stresses, the principle of molecu-lar choice revolves around optimization, rather than maximization (for example, ofsuch properties as conformational flexibility); (ii) even if alternative DNAs match,or even exceed, the optimized properties of “real” DNA, this does not necessarilymean this advantage extends to the operational milieu of chromatin, DNA proteinssuch as the histones, chromosomes, and the cell; and (iii) although various alterna-tives to the sugar and nucleic acid building blocks are also feasible, in at least manycases their synthesis in any prebiotic situation seems improbable. This is not to saythat DNA could not have been preceded by a viable and more primitive precursor,such as the TNAα-threofuranosyl oligonucleotide (Sch ̈oninget al., 2000); yet heretoo questions of possible chemical pathways and ease of prebiotic synthesis cannotbe ignored.Universal biochemistry?What of the next stage, the integration of basic biomolecules into a functioningbiochemistry? Pace (2001) has made a strong argument for the universality of sucha biochemistry. This view is relatively uncontroversial, and it echoes Wald’s famousremark that candidates for biochemistry exams would be at equal advantage whetherthey sat for them here or many light-years away on a planet orbiting Arcturus. Ina different vein, Dentonet al.(2002)haveargued that the basic protein foldsare an axiomatic product of amino acid assembly, constrained by constructionalrules that impart a law-like behavior reflecting innate and inevitable tendenciestoward constructing particular types of biological structure. The extent to whichsuch constraints apply to specific types, such as seven-helical, membrane-spanningproteins, or globins, which are often associated with particular functions (in thesetwo cases, respectively, signal transduction and oxygen transport), remains to beseen. The evidence for functional convergences in these and other proteins (ConwayMorris,2003; Zakon,2002; see also Beuthet al., 2003; Charnocket al., 2002; Chenget al., 2003; Dupuyet al., 2002; Litvak and Selinger,2003; Hamburgeret al., 1999;Boffelliet al., 2004; Kryukovet al., 2002; Johns and Somero,2004) suggests thathere, too, there may be important rules of assembly.The extent to which biochemical systems are genuinely universal is, of course,an unresolved question. Many biologists, I suspect, would not be overly surprisedto find close analogs to the citric acid cycle operating in extraterrestrial biospheres.On the other hand, most would be surprised, possibly astonished, if those similari-ties extended, for example, to signal transduction and respiratory proteins. So howdo we proceed? Even the resolution of life on Mars is probably many years in thefuture, and the likelihood of visiting exoplanetary biospheres is still centuries away."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"11 Tuning into the frequencies of life203At the moment, the only realistic ways to test such suppositions seem to fall intotwo categories. The first involves the engineering of a biological system, either toreconstruct a putative primitive state or to define alternative organizational possi-bilities. Steven Benner (2000) notes that the former approach is one of considerablesignificance in that it opens the door to a possible rapprochement of the biologicaland physical sciences. In other words, by moving biology toward the establishmentof long-sought-after general principles, paradoxically it might help to explain theextraordinary specificity and precision of many biological systems. Less often, asBenner also reminds us, is the gap between the efficacy of natural systems and theclumsiness of artificial imitations given its proper emphasis.The second line of inquiry is to identify alternatives (or rivals) in order to exploredegrees of similarity purely in terms of comparative operational terms and relativeefficacy. The engineering of biological systems to explore alternatives is, unsurpris-ingly, driven by available genetic technologies. In a stimulating overview, Bennett(2003) discusses how biological novelty can be laboratory-generated with a viewto testing the question of whether a diversity of adaptive pathways exists. He alsoexplores the corollary of whether evolution has preferred directions and inevitabili-ties of outcome, concluding that outcomes may well be predictable, but need not beexclusive. As Bennett stresses, such experimentation may lead to the emergence ofunanticipated features. His review is important because it helps to define a generalresearch program to explore predictability in an adaptive context, although, as willbecome apparent (see also Conway Morris,2003), it would be a mistake to assumethat the natural world itself cannot supply the necessary information about “alterna-tive adaptive solutions” (Bennett,2003,p.9)–that is, by examples of evolutionaryconvergence.Arelated theme of inquiry is the attempt to infer the evolution of a biologi-cal system, especially in the context of proteins. For proteins, the ancestral statesand historical pathways can be established on the basis of functionalities, typi-cally dependent on amino acids at key sites and the adaptive shifts from precursorarrangements (see, for example, Malcolmet al., 1990; Benner,2002; Zhang andRosenberg,2002; Gaucheret al., 2003). Such an approach is important not onlybecause of its implications for the so-called neutral theory of protein evolution,but also because it opens the possibility of linking these changes to environmentalcircumstances. Such a line of enquiry also offers the chance to consider whetherthe evolved system is in any way optimized.The second approach in determining the boundaries of life, and thereby theconstraints that may point to universal principles, is to consider alternative solu-tions to a common problem. Examples from a number of molecular systemsare available. Here I will address briefly the case of the respiratory proteins,which employ either iron (hemoglobin/myoglobin and hemerythrin/myoerythrin)"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"204Simon Conway Morrisor copper (hemocyanin). Although it is possible that all are ultimately derived froman ancestral metalloprotein (see, for example, Volbeda and Hol,1989), the generalconsensus is that they represent distinct solutions to problems of providing respira-tory oxygen. I review elsewhere (Conway Morris,2003)evidence that hemoglobinand myoglobin are both convergent and, in the latter case, the noteworthy conver-gence with an enzyme (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase) in some mollusks (ConwayMorris,2003, pp. 288–9). So too the hemocyanins of mollusks and arthropodsare most likely convergent solutions (Burmester,2002; see also Immesberger andBurmester,2004).The case of hemerythrin (see, for example, Stenkamp,1994;Kurtz,1999)isofparticular interest for several reasons. It is clearly distinct from the other hemo-respiratory proteins and also occurs as analogous blood and muscle types (see, forexample, Takagi and Cox,1991). Intriguingly, its occurrence in animals (specificallythe brachiopods, sipunculans, priapulids, and a number of annelids) makes nophylogenetic sense in terms of our current understanding of metazoan relationships.This is most obvious in terms of the placement of the priapulids in the ecdysozoans(i.e. related to arthropods), whereas the other three phyla are all lophotrochozoans.Even within this latter superclade, the distribution of hemerythrin does not seem tobe phylogenetically informative.Thus, even among the polychaete annelids, the occurrences of hemerythrin (seeRouse and Pleijel,2001)donot appear to map in an evolutionarily coherent man-ner. In addition, many other annelids employ either hemoglobin or the closelyrelated blood protein chlorocruorin (see Weber,1978). Identifying the antecedentsto hemerythrin is also problematic. The molecule evidently belongs to a largerclass of proteins with non-heme carboxylated-bridge diiron sites (see, for exam-ple, Coufalet al., 2000). Proteins comparable to hemerythrin are known in variousbacteria (see, for example, Herrmannet al., 1980; Beeumenet al., 1991). Althoughconvergence cannot be ruled out, it is possible that the sporadic occurrence ofhemerythrins in the Metazoa is due to lateral gene transfer (see, for example,Beeumenet al., 1991)inaway that is analogous to the cellulose gene of thetunicates (Matthysseet al., 2004; Nakashimaet al., 2004).This case study of hemerythrin raises a number of issues relevant to the argu-ments for (or against) universal biochemistries. First, with this molecule, can werule out the possibility of molecular convergences (see Herrmannet al., 1980)?One might note, for example, that even within the lophotrochozoans, specificallybrachiopods and sipunculans, the sequence divergence of their hemerythrins isconsiderable (Joshi and Sullivan,1973). Irrespective of origin, the hemerythrin inanimals is most likely the product of lateral gene transfer; but is there only onesource or several? Could, for example, different non-heme carboxylated-bridgediiron site proteins “donate” hemerythrin in separate circumstances? What are"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"11 Tuning into the frequencies of life205those circumstances? If, as seems likely, hemerythrin is polyphyletic, then whyis its occurrence so rare? Given that hemoglobin and hemocyanin are much morewidespread, should we judge, in the words of Stenkamp (1994,p.724), hemerythrinas “an evolutionary development that failed to provide the best means of solvingthe reversible oxygen-binding problem”? Is hemerythrin one of life’s “solutions,”buteffectively a curiosity? Could we go so far as to speculate that all biosphereswill certainly have hemoglobin, very likely have a copper-based respiratory proteinanalogous to the hemocyanins, and also have much rarer respiratory proteins, whichon occasion might be hemerythrin?What hemerythrin does share with hemoglobin and hemocyanin, however, is itsadaptation of dealing with dioxygen chemistry. In Kurtz’s (1999)evocative words,this is “Nature’s [way of] tiptoeing along the edges of the energetic barrier separatingreversible O2binding from OO bond cleavage without crossing it” (p. 97). Such“tiptoeing” is, of course, a striking example of evolutionary “navigation” (ConwayMorris,2003). Finally, as Kurtz notes, this triad of solutions begs the question ofwhether other oxygen-carrying proteins used for respiration still await discovery.If they do, we can now be confident that in certain critical ways they must conformto some general rules.Bifurcation points and critical “choices”Arguments, therefore, are made that at the molecular level strong constraints cer-tainly exist, and perhaps we should even look to inevitabilities. In terms of theirmolecular architecture, alien biospheres will be similar – perhaps very similar –to the only one we now know. They will not be identical, and interesting altern-atives must exist. Yet the example of hemerythrin and the questions of its ori-gin(s), possible co-option(s), and relative efficacy (especially in comparison withthe near-ubiquitous hemoglobin [Kurtz,1999] suggest that we can begin to tacklethe problem of how to define alternative trajectories in evolution. This perspectiveis clear even if we are (necessarily) limited to the one planet we happen to inhabit.Let us then accept that any biosphere will have much the same molecular sub-strate. The objection could still be raised that this base level of biomolecular com-monality has little bearing on the diversification of life. To return to hemerythrin,this protein occurs in animals as diverse as annelids, brachiopods, priapulids, andsipunculans; but (so far as we know) it has little, if any, bearing on the diversi-fication of these three sorts of worm and a bivalved animal. Rather, one needsnow to shift perspective to ask to what extent the nexus of evolution is controlledor governed by predeterminants, possible pathways, and incumbencies. Do theseundermine, if not negate, any possibility of evolutionary inevitabilities? Recall that,from a historical perspective, evolution is faced with repeated “decisions” based"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"206Simon Conway Morrison predetermined realities. To date, it is not clear to what extent a pre-existingsubstrate, say a particular protein family, is absolutely necessary for the emergenceof a given complexity such as, to take an extreme example, intelligence. Nor is itclear whether evolutionary incumbency – the preoccupation of a metaphorical highground – can in principle permanently frustrate the emergence of a particular com-plex system. These are unresolved questions, but the evidence (Conway Morris,2003) seems very much to point in the other direction; that is, toward inevitabilitiesof outcome. In the case of the absolute necessity of a given molecular substrate,the emergence of highly complex systems (notably in animals in the form of socialsystems, tool use, cultural transmission, and vocalizations) from markedly differ-ent beginnings suggests that a given molecular substratum cannot be an absolutepredeterminant.Incumbency is a more difficult question. However, the clear evidence for theemergence of recurrent levels of complexity during geological time (see, for exam-ple, Knoll and Bambach,2000) suggests that no pre-existing system can imposea complete impediment to further diversification and integration. That is evidentlywhat happened on this planet, but it begs the question, of course, of whether radi-cally alternative biospheres exist. All one can say is that if we combine the insightsin the emergence of successive complexities (Knoll and Bambach,2000) with theevidence from evolutionary convergence, then so far as earth-like planets are con-cerned it would seem that what we see around us on earth is a fair guide to whatwe would see anywhere else in the galaxy (Conway Morris,2003).Evolutionary inherencyMuch of the preceding discussion hinges on the question of when in evolutionaryhistory a particular molecule or developmental system appeared. These are gen-erally difficult to date accurately; yet, despite this relative uncertainty, it is clearthat a number of molecules and molecular mechanisms essential for the functionof a complex system had evolved at a much earlier stage and had then been elab-orated, often in distinct ways, in different lineages. Such is the case, for example,with glumate-based cell signaling (Dennison and Spalding,2000). It also is clearin the instance of the repeat protein known asarmadillo(Coates,2003). On thebasis of these and other examples, it seems reasonable to conclude that much of thecomplexity of animals and plants is evidently inherent at a microbial level. Self-evidently, animals possess intermediate-level structures defined by such propertiesas nervous systems, sensory organs, and contractile tissues. These structures, how-ever, utilize such key molecules as acetylcholine (Wessleret al., 1999), crystallins(see, for example, Piatigorsky,1992), and myosin (Berget al., 2001), all moleculesthat had evolved hundreds of millions, if not billions, of years before animals arose."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"11 Tuning into the frequencies of life207Molecular convergenceIn this section, I consider how the fitness of the environment not only applies tobiochemistry, but, as shown by several examples, also has implications for theinevitable emergence of complex systems. The first topic concerns remarkableand emerging new evidence for various sorts of molecular convergence. At theoutset, this would be expected to be surprising for the simple reason that, with anastronomically large number of alternatives, a random process should not generatecoincidences of even short identical sequences. That is the principle. But, in fact,considerably more examples exist than might otherwise be imagined (see ConwayMorris,2003; Zakon,2002; see also Beuthet al., 2003; Charnocket al., 2002;Chenget al., 2003; Dupuyet al., 2002; Litvak and Selinger,2003; Hamburgeret al., 1999; Boffelliet al., 2004; Kryukovet al., 2002; Johns and Somero,2004).Such examples are less surprising when functional constraints are considered, suchas those associated with active enzymatic sites (for recent examples see Beuthet al., 2003; Johns and Somero,2004).A particularly interesting case concerns an example of convergent evolution ina virus, specifically the bacteriophageφX174 (Bullet al., 1997). Admittedly, thisexample is somewhat artificial inasmuch as it is laboratory-based and involved inan experiment designed to study the evolutionary response to a change in a rathergeneral environmental property, in this case an increase in temperature. Despite theconstraints of the protocol, the results were important: the study of five lineagesassociated with two bacterial hosts (Escherichia coliandSalmonella typhimurium)showed striking convergence at a few key sites in the genome. The response toheat, therefore, was evidently selective. As Bull and colleagues also point out,despite the generality of the imposed environmental change, the experiments arestrongly constrained both by the similar selective environment (specifically, anincrease from 38◦Cto43.5◦C) and by the fact that the starting point of each virallineage had a practically identical genome. On the other hand, it is important tonote that, without the prior knowledge of the convergence, the true evolutionarytree of divergence would have been unrecoverable. Moreover, although Bull andcolleagues stress the unusual nature of this case, they also note the possibility thatmolecular convergences may be more prevalent than has generally been expected.Given the widely acknowledged reality of extreme sensitivities of certain molecularsites (although remarkably unexplored [but see Axe,2000]), such convergencesare actually unsurprising. This is despite the average scientist’s reaction – almostalways precisely the opposite, with exclamations of astonishment and the use ofsuch adjectives as “stunning” (Conway Morris,2003,p.128).Evidence for molecular convergence is emerging in other quarters. Examplesinclude both transcriptional machinery and developmental processes. In the context"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"208Simon Conway Morrisof the former, particularly important is the analysis by Conant and Wagner (2003)of gene circuits inE. coliandSaccharomyces cerevisiae(yeast). Of the four cir-cuit types, for example those known as bi-fan and feed-forward in yeast (and twoequivalents inE. coli), the evidence strongly points to the great majority havingindependent origins. Conant and Wagner remark:Our results also suggest that convergent evolution...mayhaveanimportant role inthe higher organizational level of gene circuits. Stephen Jay Gould famously asked whatwould be conserved if life’s tape, its evolutionary history, was replayed...Transcriptionalregulation circuits, it seems, might come out just about the same.(p. 265)Although these examples of molecular convergence can always be put in a particularcontext, the emerging evidence for various sorts of convergence in developmen-tal biology is attracting considerable attention, principally because of continuingdiscussions of the nature of biological homology and the roles of constraint. Putbriefly, would we not expect the same structure to have the same genetic basis? And,if this basis is wanting, will the structure then never evolve? Possibly not. Evidencefor possible convergence in developmental mechanisms falls into three broad cat-egories. The first concerns the repeated and independent emergence of a particularphenotype, but on the basis of the same regulatory mechanism. Examples may bequite specific; for instance, the loss of trichomes in a larval fly (Sucenaet al., 2003)or melanism in birds (Hoekstra and Price,2004; Mundyet al., 2004). Alternatively,they may be more general, as in the evolution of lecithotropic, direct-developing seaurchin larvae (Wray,2002; see also Nielsenet al., 2003). The focus of interest is thereiteration of a phenotype, presumably in an adaptive context, and the unsurprisingobservation that a particular developmental pathway will be recruited “on demand.”The homoplastic spanner this throws into the painfully literal cladistic machinerywill be self-evident. Although these convergences involve examples from animals,a comparable result has also been documented in bacteria. This involved a study ofdirected evolution (for 20,000 generations) in twelve populations ofE. coli. Ratherremarkably, fifty-nine genes showed parallel changes in expression patterns – allin the same direction (Cooperet al., 2003).Asecond category is potentially more significant. In this case, a very similarphenotype emerges from a different developmental basis. Here, too, one can findwell-documented cases in fly development (see, for example, Gompel and Carroll,2003;Wittkoppet al., 2003), as well as melanism in the cat family (Eiziriket al.,2003). This category is arguably much more important because it is central to theidentification of convergence in phenotypes. The evolutionary route is navigated invery different ways, but leads to the same “solution” (Conway Morris,2003).A third category is where complex structures are “built” by recruitment of similargenetic modules; although they are nominally the “same,” they are patently not"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"11 Tuning into the frequencies of life209homologous. The almost identical construction of the insect wing and the vertebratelimb is a striking example (see Tabinet al., 1999).Closely linked to the question of convergence (and constraint) in developmentalsystems is the clear evidence for repeated co-option of developmental genes fornew functions. So widespread is this phenomenon that major difficulties arise indetermining the “primitive” function of a given gene. In this context, it also isdifficult to decide what, if any, are the general rules of engagement: are certain genesrecruited “come what may”? In specific cases, it does look as though the organism inquestion had “no choice.” This is evident, for example, in the repeated recruitmentof theotxgene to tube-foot development in direct-developing sea urchins (Nielsenet al., 2003). Other possible examples of apparent redeployment are cases such asgenes essential for the development of the eye being recruited for the expressionof spermatocyte (Fabrizioet al., 2003), muscle (Heanueet al., 1999; see alsoRelaix and Buckingham,1999), and salivary duct tissue (Joneset al., 1998). Thesepresumably are fortuitous; but, alternatively, deeper constraints may make the co-option of these genes (and their protein products) effectively inevitable. Too littleis known at present to clarify this uncertainty.Social microbes, intelligent plants?The emergence of complex systems has another interesting dimension concern-ing the evolution of analogous systems. In one way, such similarities are hardlysurprising given that they call on a common molecular repertoire. They remainimportant, however, because they give us some sense of the range of alternativesand a healthy reminder that, although animals may be the only group with thepotential to understand creation, other players reinforce our sense of its richness,diversity, and even strangeness. Thus, Crespi (2001; see also Rainey and Rainey,2003;Velicer and Yu,2003) notes how it is that “all the hallmarks of a complexand coordinated social life” (p. 178) are identifiable in microbial communities,with analogs of cooperation, division of labor, communication, and sociality beingidentifiable. In fact, Crespi also identifies seven social phenomena that representbehavioral convergences with “higher” organisms.In an even more ambitious vein, Trewavas (2003)explores how aspects of com-munication, computation, and intentionality in plants reflect not only their adap-tive plasticity, but also a form of biological capacity not inaccurately described as“intelligence.” At first sight, his analysis seems to be decidedly heterodox. Yet hisfundamental point seems clear: that the many analogs of animal intelligence, suchas stimulus response and memory, are predicated on a broadly similar chemicalbasis. The analogs are just that. Trewavas offers interesting speculations on futureagendas for describing plant communication. He also notes a way in which the"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"210Simon Conway Morrismultiple networks offered by separate ramets allow the potential for a sort of mul-tiple channel form of integrated information processing (see also Firn,2004, andreply by Trewavas,2004).Higher-level convergences?Evolution spans a series of levels. A typical order would read: molecules (or genes),cells, individuals (or ramets), societies, and communities. Questions of where themain drivers might lie in this hierarchy, and what interactions are between theselevels, continue to be areas of active debate (see, for example, Gregory,2004). Inthe context of convergence, it is generally agreed that even if societal structures (e.g.fission–fusion, monogamy) show convergence, at yet higher levels of communitystructure convergence generally is not observed. Such a conclusion is not surprising.Communities are seen largely asad hocassociations. At least in some cases, suchas Pleistocene forests, the reassembly of a community following the retreat of theice sheets and recolonization seem mostly haphazard. Some counter-exceptions,however, emerge; as with other examples of convergence at lower levels of the evo-lutionary hierarchy, it is possible that general principles will be discovered. HereI touch on four disparate examples. These suggest that, in certain circumstances,operational rules apply beyond the species level. The central theme is the recog-nition of so-called ecomorphs. This term refers to unrelated species that evolvesimilar morphologies in response to equivalent functional demands within a givenenvironment. As with other examples of convergence, the degrees of similarity areseldom precise, but can still be striking.Particular attention has been paid to ecomorphs in fish (Conway Morris,2003,p. 133), among which the African cichlids are particularly instructive (see, forexample, Allenderet al., 2003; Kassamet al., 2003;Koblm ̈ulleret al., 2004),although other groups also provide relevant examples (see, for example, Brosset,2003; Knouft,2003). Perhaps more celebrated are the instances of anolid eco-morphs in the Caribbean islands (Conway Morris,2003,p.125; see also Lososet al., 2003). More recently, Gillespie (2004) produced an absorbing survey ofcommunity assembly of Hawaiian spiders. She identified four distinct ecomorphsthat have emerged independently multiple times. She writes: “...within any com-munity, similar sets of ecomorphs arise...suggest[ing that] universal principlesunderlie community assembly” (p. 356). In the case of the mammalian guilds, thesimilarity of community structure has long been appreciated (Conway Morris2003,p. 132). Nevertheless, these ecomorphs continue to attract interest (see, for example,Meehan and Martin,2003). And the examples of plant ecomorphs, most famouslythe xerophytes, are almost too well-known to require comment. However, compar-isons may also be made at the community level involving very disparate plants,"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"11 Tuning into the frequencies of life211notably bryophytes versus higher plants (Steelet al., 2004). Such examples againpoint towards possible general rules.Since the addition of molecular data to phylogenetic studies (hitherto largelydependent on morphological information) it has become clear that homoplasy isrampant. It is also clear that in numerous cases the earlier reliance on morphologicalsimilarity in establishing a given phylogeny was seriously misplaced. Again andagain, morphological features turn out to be convergent. Many such examples couldbe given. From the recent literature, let me note the cases of the pulmonate snailsand the multiple invention of a lung (Grandeet al., 2004); tropical scleractiniancorals (Fukamiet al., 2004); mushrooms (O’Donnellet al., 2001; see also Hibbettet al., 1997a,b); and ferns (Rankeret al., 2004). In reality, this is hardly surprising.If one has a given biological “form,” it is to be expected that evolution not only will“explore” and populate ecological and functional space, but will do so repeatedly.Thus, given various constraints, groups inevitably will navigate again and againtoward particular solutions.Although this evidently applies to particular clades, the notion that a generalprinciple exists so that any form will be convergent is likely to be greeted withskepticism. The reasons for this are complex. In outline, I suggest the source of thisskepticism is actually anti-evolutionary, revolving around typological and essen-tialist views of body plans, especially at the level of the phylum. Thus, whereasone might concede that convergence is prevalent in the pulmonate snails, sclerac-tinians, fungi, or ferns, it will be widely assumed that the anthozoans (and encom-passing cnidarians), gastropods (and encompassing mollusks), fungi (or at leastbasidiomycetes), and tracheophytes (and so ferns) are monophyletic. This may becorrect. But it is difficult to test, in terms of both the fossil record and the moleculardata. The point to appreciate is that if the processes of evolution giving rise tobiological forms are effectively the same at whatever taxonomic level, then one hasno reason to suppose that the process of evolutionary “exploration” does not occurat taxonomic levels, which, in hindsight, we would identify as equivalent to classor even phylum. Thus, during the Cambrian “explosion,” it would be as likely thatvarious groups were “trying” to become cnidarians or mollusks. If correct, this isan important point. Not only will homoplasy be universal, but at any given stageof the evolution of life we should not be surprised to see a number of groups allattempting to run along similar evolutionary trajectories, not only in terms of bodyplans, but in such general developments as biomineralization, the invasion of theland, or the rise of advanced intelligence.Toappreciate this in more detail, consider the following list of connectedexamples: photosynthesis, chlorophyll, chloroplasts, water-conducting tissue(xylem), flowers, and a rose garden. Most evolutionary biologists would, I suspect,see this list as one of ever-decreasing evolutionary probabilities. As far as planetary"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"212Simon Conway Morrislife is concerned, photosynthesis may well be universal (see also Wolstencroft andRaven,2002). Such may also be true of chlorophyll (Wald,1974). (In passing, weneed to note that although proteorhodopsin can also act as a phototrophic molecule[Bejaet al., 2001], its use is restricted to particular bacteria and was co-opted fromits prior use as a proton pump. Moreover, although it may well provide an energeticadvantage to the bacteria, apparently no evidence exists that it can actually assist inthe fixation of carbon.) Beyond photosynthesis and possibly chlorophyll, the rest ofmy list would be regarded as a series of fortuitous evolutionary innovations of onlyterrestrial significance. Such a view, however, might be premature. Thus, althoughthey are generally regarded as monophyletic, Stilleret al.(2003) present evidencethat chloroplasts may have arisen independently several times. So, too, xylem hasevolved twice (Ligraneet al., 2002), as have flowers (see Conway Morris,2003,pp. 135–8). On this basis, only the rose garden is unique, although here we need toremind ourselves that flowers also show recurrent homoplasies (see, for example,Hufford,1997).Evolutionary convergence, therefore, gives an interesting and largely unappreci-ated slant on life. Nevertheless, does it really provide the sought-after generalitiesthat might also mesh with Henderson’s concept of the “fitness of the environment”?Discussion is hindered, not only because of the inevitable specializations inbiology – watching a biochemist, an ecologist, and a paleontologist in animated con-versation is an all-too-rare sight – but also because we are uncertain what depends onwhat. Thus, the gene-centered view, popularized by Richard Dawkins, may be seento be not only over-reductionist, but in some cases possibly seriously misleading.Consider, for example, the classic case of haplodiploidy as an explanation of thehighly organized colonies observed in the eusocial insects. Despite the elegance ofthis hypothesis and its neat explanation of how non-reproductive individuals retaina genetic benefit even though they cannot directly pass on their genes, an alternativeexplanation for kin selection is the benefit conferred by a balance between individ-ual risk and colony viability (a sort of life insurance). This seems, at least in somecircumstances, to be a more convincing explanation for the origin and maintenanceof eusociality (see, for example, Queller and Strassman,1998; Fieldet al., 2000;Landiet al., 2003). The point here is not to dispute the reality of kin selection, but tostress that the life-insurance hypothesis, together with other features such as workerpolicing and individuality (in terms of recognition and apparent choice of activity),removes the reductionist stamp to eusociality with the implicit assumption of blindand robotic forces.Yet finding a common ground is difficult. For example, the debate of “moleculesversus morphology” remains inconclusive, despite the remarkable advances indevelopmental biology. The truth surely is that our growing understanding of adap-tive complexes only serves to reinforce our (or at least my) wonder at the robustness,"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"11 Tuning into the frequencies of life213integration, and sophistication of biological systems. Molecules obviously play apart, but they are very far from being the whole story. No wonder these systems areso hard to dissect. Moreover, although the adaptive explanation (and penalty forfailure) is self-evident, it is worth reminding ourselves of the immense difficultiesthat confront anyab initioimitation of these systems, perhaps most obviously inthe arena of artificial intelligence.Paradox of stability and changeOrganisms appear on the whole as though they had been precisely engineered.They operate as though aware of their environment, and invariably they are able tomodify it – albeit on a variety of scales. In addition, they are capable of sophisticatedcomputational exercises operating across a variety of timescales. Not only areorganisms remarkably robust in their developmental pathways and environmentalresponses, but they also represent extraordinary machines in their ability to engagein sophisticated internal “conversations” whereby feedback loops ensure long-termhomeostasis. No matter how familiar we are with these factors, we too easily takethem for granted. Yet, the fine-tuning of organisms is entirely extraordinary, as evena glance at a living cell and its biochemical intricacies will confirm: machine-like,but unlike any machine we can build. These remarks apply as much to inevitableinefficiencies, and here the Rubisco enzyme comes to mind. A critical future testwith this enzyme will be to see how successful any “improvement” that accompaniestechnological intervention will actually be. If Rubisco has not been improved duringbillions of years of evolution, it is not clear that we will do much better. Rubisco isfar from perfect, but it may still be the best.The integration and complexity of the organism, not to mention the emergenceof form from a fertilized zygote in multicellular groups, depend, of course, ona molecular substrate. This is classically the area of developmental biology andgenetic intervention. Yet, despite the many remarkable successes (of which theresult ofPax-6expression in terms of unrestricted eye development across thebody of a fly is perhaps the most iconic), this area of evolution contains unresolvedparadoxes. The central dilemma revolves around the place of genetic conserva-tion versus innovation. The former is most famously expressed in the role ofHoxgenes in axial patterning, which to the first approximation are identical in fly andmouse. Similar arguments have been applied to key features of animal organization,such as eye and heart development and definition of dorsoventrality, or in plants,such as development of flowers (see, for example, Theissen and Becker,2004).Such a program has considerable evolutionary implications. First, the recognitionof such genetic systems in more primitive groups invites identification of homol-ogous structures. Second, the existence of such gene-control systems may provide"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"214Simon Conway Morrisa possible framework to discuss evolutionary convergent directionalities andconstraints.The Cnidaria (a phylum familiar to the non-expert as the group containing jelly-fish and sea anemones) exemplifies this possibility. Thus, model cnidarians, notablyHydraandNematostella, provide a molecular template from which it is reasonablysupposed that more advanced metazoans emerged. Finnertyet al.(2004)arguefor a fundamental equivalence of body axes (anterior–posterior and dorsoventraldefining bilaterality) in cnidarians and higher metazoans. Similarly, an importantdevelopmental gene family known as COE (an acronym based on three importantgenes: Col/Olf-1/EBF) found in vertebrates and invertebrates is proposed, on thebasis of its expression patterns in cnidarian development, to have played an ancestralrole in chemoreception (Panget al., 2004). Such examples are powerful metaphorsfor both the molecular basis of evolution and the deep-seated unity of biologicalorganization, in this case of animals. Yet, such views at least require qualification.Bosch and Khalturin (2002), for example, emphasize the limits to developmentalconservation and the relatively unacknowledged importance of novel genes thathave equivalent functions, but not molecular homology, with other systems. Sotoo Primus and Freeman (2004) caution against over-simplistic identification ofsimilar function, for example in theβ-catenin signaling pathway, in widely differ-ent groups. Indeed, as the net of genomic investigation widens, the versatility andflexibility of these genetic systems will become apparent. For example, Locascioet al.(2002)explore the history of the gene family Snail, a zinc-finger protein, andspecifically products of a gene-duplication event known assnailandslug. These areassociated with many important developmental features, including mesoderm andneural formation. The Snail family of genes is widespread. Yet in the vertebrates,Locascio and colleagues have shown that for three features (lens, premigratoryneural crest tissue, and tailbud mesenchyme),snailandslugshow a “much higherdegree of plasticity and complexity than expected” (p. 16845).Such qualifications deserve to be widely appreciated, even though the extentof recruitment and redeployment of developmental genes in certain examples iswell attested. The echinoderms provide an excellent example (see, for example,Wray and Lowe,2000). At first sight, the straightforward conclusion would bethat the molecular components of evolution are no different from any other andwill be co-opted when necessary. So, too, it would seem reasonable to assume thatsuch co-option is governed by local rules, if not opportunity. This, however, maynot entirely correspond with emerging evidence for convergence in developmentalpathways. Thus, in the case of the echinoderms, Wray and Lowe point to severalinstances of possible convergence (see also Nielsenet al., 2003). Other examplessuggest that such convergences may be more widespread than generally realized.Some examples were given earlier in this chapter in the general discussion of"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"11 Tuning into the frequencies of life215molecular convergence. The same phenotype may emerge by the repeated employ-ment of the same genes, albeit independently of each other (see, for example, Mundyet al., 2004; Sucenaet al., 2003). This is probably the most frequent situation andalso the most unsurprising. Much more significant is a similar phenotype arisingfrom different genotypes (see, for example, Gompel and Carroll,2003; Reeves andOlmstead,2003;Wittkoppet al., 2003). This dichotomy – of similar phenotypesarising from the same genotype as opposed to the same phenotype emerging fromdivergent genotypes – will need considerable refinement as the details of the path-ways are elucidated. For example, in a study of evolutionary parallelism in plants,the multiple origins of a particular trait depend on a single developmental program.Despite this, in each case the specific genetic changes are different (Yoon and Baum,2004).The potential importance of this area of evolutionary convergence has not beenoverlooked. Rudel and Sommer (2003) write:Our understanding of the role of parallel evolution to produce similar structures in closelyrelated taxa and of the causes and mechanisms for the occurrence of convergent evolutionis a black box, yet an understanding of how and why disparate species within groups ofrelated organisms independently generate the same solutionde novoand obtain an analogousmorphology may be the most important pursuit of all . . . The phenomena of convergence,parallelism, and homoplasy . . . will be one of the largest challenges for the future study ofevolution of developmental mechanisms.(p. 32)The eternal returnIf divergence and convergence are considered antithetical, then most evolutionarybiologists typically will ascribe the greater role to the former. This accords wellwith the vast diversity of the biosphere, as well as with the pervasive influenceof the body plan concept whereby the organic world can be divided into a finitenumber of “designs.” Yet, within any clade, the phenomenon of convergence isubiquitous, and, as already noted, careful analysis of morphological features in theelucidation of phylogenies typically reveals rampant homoplasy (see, for exam-ple, Rankeret al., 2004). And, interestingly, in successive diversifications within aclade convergence becomes increasingly prevalent (Wagner,2000); in essence, theclade “runs out of things to do.” In such cases, it is generally the case that the char-acter states that turn out to be homoplastic are often relatively simple. It is importantto stress, however, that in terms of the emergence of complex biological properties,such as those associated with social structure and intelligence, convergences againare found to be widespread.This divergence of approaches that look at evolution in terms of divergenceversus convergence doubtless will continue to generate fruitful dialog. Each, taken"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"216Simon Conway Morrisalone, will lead to remarkable insights. However, a wider aim is to delineate the basic“landscape” of evolution and the extent to which navigation to stable points (perhapseven attractors) is achieved along “superhighways” compared with “country lanes.”Will such discoveries help to map aspects of Henderson’s notion of the biocentric“fitness of the environment”?The best test, of course, would be the discovery and documentation of one ormore extraterrestrial biospheres, assuming any exist. Even the exercise of tryingto envisage biospheres on planets with physical parameters very far removed fromthose of the earth, in terms of, perhaps, size (and gravity) or atmospheric density,might refine our appreciation of the evolutionary possibilities. A terrestrial context,however, might also serve to give some guidelines. Consider, for example, thesurprising fact that in various plant biomes a particular form has never evolvedwithin the indigenous flora. Thus, as Mack (2003) points out, it is rather remarkablethat succulents have not evolved in Yunnan, or (with few exceptions) annuals inNew Zealand, or (for that matter) sand-binding grasses (marram) in the PacificNorthwest. So too in a number of cases, such as the spread of alien prickly acaciain Australia, it is surprising that none of the native acacias have evolved in similarstructures. The importance of these “gaps” becomes clear on the arrival of thosepreadapted aliens that aggressively colonize the given biome. Not only can thislead to radical adjustments of the flora, but it also can lead to the definition ofnew habitats that may trigger further ecological change. This has been particularlyevident in Hawaii since the introduction of the red mangrove. Note also the potentialdisaster awaiting the temperate forests of the Pacific Northwest in North Americaif bamboo is allowed to naturalize.Mack’s (2003) analysis is a compelling instance of the importance of phyloge-netic constraints, even though in many cases the absence of an “expected” life formremains rather puzzling. When, however, these observations are set in the widercontext of convergence in plants (see Conway Morris,2003), then one can beginto resolve the dichotomy between divergence (and phylogenetic constraint) andconvergence (and evolutionary inevitability). Local histories are not only impor-tant, but fascinating. They are also a reminder of the plenitude of the world. Onthe other hand, wider principles are at play. Were we ever to be able to wander inan extraterrestrial forest, we likely would still struggle to reconcile the expectedstrangeness with the unexpected familiarity.FuturesSuch inherencies and analogs suggest that the motors of adaptation and ecologicaldiversification make the emergence of complex biological systems, say an eyeseeing a rose garden, probable, and perhaps even inevitable. The basic similarity"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"11 Tuning into the frequencies of life217of these analogs indicates that radical, alien alternatives may be much less likelythan is often thought. Such arguments would, I suggest, apply to the emergenceof all biological complexities, including intelligence (Conway Morris,2003) and,as Grammeret al.(2003)have recently argued, also to the appreciation of beauty.Consider the evolutionary inevitability of intelligence. There now appears to bespecific support from experiments designed to establish whether cognitive functionsare uniquely propositional and so in principle unable to function in the absenceof symbolic-based language with implicit semantics and syntax. The alternativeconcept is that cognitive functions might be based fundamentally on an analog-coding process whereby a continuum between cognitive abilities and lower-levelsensory mechanisms exists. One way to test this is to examine numerosity (theability of animals to count) insofar as this property presumably involves both thesensory perception (“I see two dogs”) and abstraction (“I see two extraterrestrials,not two dogs”). Such experiments (see, for example, Nieder and Miller,2003)indicate that the analog-coding hypothesis is correct. At the moment, such resultsmake the evolutionary emergence of human cognition unremarkable. But they alsofail to explain why in certain important respects it is unique.Another intriguing question is whether the fitness of the environment confersany predictability on the future of the evolutionary process. Certainly, the likeli-hood of a universal biochemistry and the inevitability of organismic convergenceat many levels (Conway Morris,2003) provide a necessary framework. But whatof the future evolution of intelligence? Hofman (2001) has convincingly arguedthat the potential for further encephalization in the hominids is limited. The stockresponse, of course, is to postulate computer-based extensions of our cognitive abil-ity. A more radical alternative is to suggest that in the evolution of (any) biospherethe rise of bird- and mammal-like intelligences with a potential for developingtechnologies is geologically short-lived and is replaced by other systems, such asinsect eusocial colonies. Such a view will seem far-fetched. It may be that the com-plexities achievable by insects and their eusocial societies have gone as far as theyare able. Nevertheless, some degree of caution might be advisable. This is for atleast three reasons. First, extrapolating evolutionary trends into the future has beengenerally regarded as a futile exercise, although in principle a proper understand-ing of the evolutionary “landscape” might confer a degree of predictability. Evenso, from our present perspective, estimating the potential of a complex system isfraught with difficulties. Suppose we encountered a pre-australopithecine and setit in the context of a late Miocene African ecosystem. Would we,ab initio, predictourselves?The second reason for caution is that although we know quite a lot about theincreasing complexity of the biosphere through geological time, we have littleunderstanding about how the complex systems interact and reciprocate. A popular"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"218Simon Conway Morrissuggestion, for example, concerns the co-evolution of angiosperms and insects.Similarly, one can speculate about the evolution of sonar (bat, cetacean) and theprey response. Clearly, interactions occur; but what are the evolutionary dynamics?So, too, with the independent emergence of many complex insect societies – howare they driving the rest of the biosphere, and on what timescales?Finally, consider the sometimes underappreciated complexity of the socialinsects themselves. These include not only complex societies of varying types, butalso sophisticated communication (e.g. bee “dance,” quorum sensing), co-ordinatedactivity (e.g. wing beating), memory, sleep, ability to distinguish same from dif-ferent, metabolic control and resource appropriation, and, most famously, the agri-culture in attine ants and an analogous system in termites. As noted earlier, it ispossible that the systems are incapable of further elaboration. To my mind, however,this may well be incorrect, and in any event our views of intelligence are still toonarrow. Indeed, as our knowledge of complex organic systems capable of mem-ory, communication, and computation grows, we may find ourselves consideringsystems even more arcane than that of the social insects.In conclusion, I wish simply to comment that, although the notion of the “fitnessof the environment” is most obvious and direct at the level of biochemistry, the inter-connections of life via evolution effectively predetermine the process. This situationevidently imparts both directionality and, more controversially, inevitability.In summary, wherever life exists, there will, in due course, evolve mind. Whetherit is always our type of mind is altogether another question.AcknowledgmentsIacknowledge support from the John Templeton Foundation, and I warmly thankSandra Last and Vivien Brown for typing numerous drafts.

Banavar and Amos MaritanIntroductionIt is now believed that our universe was created around 13.8 billion years ago.Our planet earth came into existence around 4.5 billion years ago. For nearly abillion years or so after it was formed, the earth was stark and bereft of life. Thematter contained on earth was inorganic with relatively small molecules. Therewere endless rock formations, oceans, and an atmosphere.And then there was life.The problem of how life was created is a fascinating one. Our focus is on lookingat life on earth and asking how it works. The lessons we learn provide hints to theanswer to the deep and fundamental question pondered by our ancients: Was life onearth inevitable? Then there are the questions posed by Henderson [1]: Is the natureof our physical world biocentric? Is there a need for fine-tuning in biochemistry toprovide for the fitness of life in the cosmos – or, even less ambitiously, for life hereon earth? Surprisingly, as we will show, a physics approach turns out to be valuablefor thinking about these questions.All living organisms have a genetic map consisting of a one-dimensional stringof information encoded in the DNA molecule. An essential question that one seeksto answer is how an organism converts that information into a three-dimensionalliving being.Life has many common patterns. All living cells follow certain simple “universal”themes. As eloquently described by Hoagland and Dodson [2]intheir classic bookThe Way Life Works, these patterns include the following properties.\u0001Life builds from the bottom up.\u0001Life uses a few themes to generate many variations.\u0001Life organizes with information.Fitness of the Cosmos for Life: Biochemistry and Fine-Tuning,ed.

Banavar and Amos Maritan\u0001Life tends to optimize rather than maximize.\u0001Life is opportunistic.\u0001Life competes within a cooperative framework.\u0001Life is interconnected and interdependent.The revolution in molecular biology [3] sparked by the discovery [4]ofthe structureof the DNA molecule 50 years ago has led to a breathtakingly beautiful descriptionof life. Life employs well-tailored chain molecules to store and replicate informa-tion, carry out a dizzying array of functionalities, and provide a molecular basis fornatural selection. The complementary base-pairing mechanism in DNA combinedwith its double-helix structure serves as a repository of information and provides anelegant mechanism for replication [4]. The replication is prone to errors or muta-tions; these errors, which are the basis of evolution, are in turn copied in futuregenerations [5]. Using the RNA molecule as an intermediary, the information con-tained in the DNA genes is translated into proteins, which are linear chains of aminoacids. Unlike the DNA molecule, which has one structure, protein molecules [6, 7]fold into thousands of native-state structures under physiological conditions. Forproteins, form determines functionality, and the rich variety of observed formsunderscores the versatility of proteins. There then follows a complex orchestrateddance in which proteins catalyze reactions, sometimes speeding up reactions bymore than a factor of 10 billion, interact with one another, and finally feed backinto the genes to regulate the synthesis of other proteins [3]. Thus, life originatesfrom the dynamics of large networks. Living cells are complex systems whose con-stituents interact selectively, non-linearly, and in a temporally orchestrated mannerto yield coherent and robust behavior.Our focus in this chapter is on understanding a key component of this network oflife: the globular proteins that act as enzymes. In his bookFor the Love of Enzymespublished in 1989 [8], the brilliant biochemist Arthur Kornberg wrote eloquently:What chemical feature most clearly enables the living cell and organism to function, growand reproduce? Not the carbohydrate stored as starch in plants or glycogen in animals, northe depots of fat. It is not the structural proteins that form muscle, elastic tissue, and theskeletal fabric. Nor is it DNA, the genetic material. Despite its glamor, DNA is simplythe construction manual that directs the assembly of the cell’s proteins. The DNA is itselflifeless, its language cold and austere. What gives the cell its life and personality areenzymes. They govern all body processes; malfunction of even one enzyme can be fatal.Nothing in nature is so tangible and vital to our lives as proteins, and yet so poorly understoodand appreciated by all but a few scientists.A protein molecule is large and has many atoms. In addition, the water moleculessurrounding the protein play a crucial role in its behavior. At the microscopic level,the laws of quantum mechanics can be used to deduce the interactions, but the"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"12 Life on earth: the role of proteins227degrees of freedom are far too many for the system to be studied in all its detail.When one attempts to look at the problem in a coarse-grained manner [9] with whatone hopes are the essential degrees of freedom, it is very hard to determine whatthe effective potential energies of interaction are. This situation makes the proteinproblem particularly daunting, and no solution has yet been found.Over many decades, many experimental data have been accumulated; yet theo-retical progress has been somewhat limited. The problem is highly interdisciplinaryand touches on biology, chemistry, and physics; it is often hard to distill the essen-tial features of each of the multiple aspects of the problem. The great successes ofquantum chemistry in the determination of the structure of the DNA molecule [4]and in the spectacular prediction that helices and sheets [10, 11, 12] are the buildingblocks of protein structures have spurred much work using detailed chemistry forunderstanding the protein problem. Such work has been very insightful in providinguseful hints on how proteins behave at the atomic scale in performing their tasks.The missing feature in such a theoretical approach, of course, is that it treats eachprotein as a special entity with all the attendant details of the sequence of aminoacids, their intricate side-chain atoms, and the water molecules. Such an approach,while quite valuable, neither has as a goal nor can lend itself to a unified way ofunderstanding seemingly disparate phenomena pertaining to proteins. Reinforcingthis, experiments, which are very challenging, are carried out on one protein ata time and cry out for an understanding of the behavior of an individual class ofprotein.The lessons we have learned from physics are of a different nature. The his-tory of physics is replete with examples of the elucidation of connections betweenwhat seem to be distinct phenomena and the development of a unifying frame-work, which, in turn, leads to new observable consequences [13]. Indeed, strongevidence suggests that globular proteins share many common characteristics: theirability to fold rapidly and reproducibly in order to create a hydrophobic core, thefact that there seem to be a relatively small number (on the order of a few thou-sand) of distinct modular folds made up of helices and almost planar sheets, thefact that protein folds are flexible and versatile in order to accomplish the dizzy-ing array of functionalities that these proteins perform, and the unfortunate ten-dency of proteins to aggregate and form amyloids, which are implicated in humandiseases.Researchers have made many attempts at using physics-based approaches (suchas all-atom molecular simulations, simpler coarse-grained models that retain whatone hopes are the essential degrees of freedom, and statistical approaches for deter-mining the effective interactions between them) for understanding proteins [9].These methods have provided valuable insights on how one might think about theproblem and have served as a means of understanding experimental data. Yet, no"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"228Jayanth R. Banavar and Amos Maritansimple unification has been achieved in a deeper understanding of the key principlesat work in proteins.Our goal here is to present a different approach to the protein problem that wehave developed with many collaborators. We restrict ourselves to globular pro-teins, which display the rich variety of native-state structures. Other interesting andimportant classes of proteins [14] include membrane proteins and fibrous proteins,butwedonot consider them here. Our focus is on understanding the origin ofprotein structures and how they form the basis for both functionality and naturalselection. Our work points to a unification of the various aspects of all proteins:symmetry and geometry determine the limited menu of folded conformations thata protein can choose from for its native-state structure. Such structures are in amarginally compact phase in the vicinity of a phase transition and are thereforeeminently suited for biological function. These structures are the molecular targetfor the powerful forces of evolution. Proteins are well-designed sequences of aminoacids that fit well into one of these predetermined folds and are prone to misfold-ing and aggregation, leading to the formation of amyloids, which are implicatedin debilitating human diseases [15, 16] such as Alzheimer’s syndrome, light-chainamyloidosis, and spongiform encephalopathies. We will show how our frameworktouches on the issue of fine-tuning for life on earth. Michael Denton, in Chapter13of this book, discusses further the fascinating consequences of our principal resultthat the menu of protein folds is determined by physical law.Phases of matter: from spheres to tubesThe fluid and crystalline phases of matter can be readily understood [17]intermsof the behavior of a simple system of hard spheres. The standard way of ensuringthe self-avoidance of a system of uniform hard spheres is to consider all pairs ofspheres and require that their centers are no closer than their diameter. Studiesof hard spheres have a venerable history [18], including early work by Kepleron the packing of cannonballs in a ship’s hold. Each hard sphere can be thoughtof as a point-particle or a zero-dimensional object with its own private space ofspatial extent equal to its radius. Generalizing to a one-dimensional object, onemust consider a line or a string, with private space associated with each point alongthe line, leading to a uniform tube of radius of cross-section or thickness,, withits axis defined by the line. (Likewise, one could consider a collection of interactingtubes.) The new feature, with respect to the hard-sphere system, is that a flexibletube has self-interaction. The generalization of the hard-sphere constraint to thedescription of the self-avoidance of a tube of non-zero thickness is as follows [19].Consider all triplets of points along the axis of the tube.

When points are taken from different neighborhoods that are close tointersection,ρapproximates (half of) the distance of closest approach.of the triplets, and ensure that none of the radii are less than the tube thickness [20].This prescription surprisingly entails discarding pairwise interactions and workingwith effective many-body interactions for the description of the self-avoidance ofa tube or sheet of non-zero thickness, as shown in Figure12.1.One may visualize a tube as the continuum limit of a discrete chain of tethereddisks or coins [21]offixed radius separated from one another by a distanceain thelimit ofa→0. The inherent anisotropy associated with a coin (the heads-to-tailsdirection being different from the other two) reflects the fact that a special localdirection at each position is defined by the locations of the adjacent objects along thechain. An alternative description of a discrete chain molecule is a string-and-beadsmodel in which the tethered objects are spheres. The key difference between thesetwo descriptions is the different symmetry of the tethered objects. On compaction,spheres tend to surround themselves isotropically with other spheres, unlike the tubesituation in which nearby tube segments need to be placed parallel to one another.Even for unconstrained particles, deviations from spherical symmetry (replacing asystem of hard spheres with one of hard rods, for example) lead to rich new liquidcrystal phases [22, 23]. Likewise, the tube and a chain of tethered spheres exhibitquite distinct behaviors."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"230Jayanth R. Banavar and Amos MaritanMarginally compact tubesConsider a tube of non-zero thickness undergoing compaction to expel the wateraway from the interior of its structure in the folded state. (In order to make con-nection with proteins, it is useful to note that the backbone of all amino acidscontains a carbon atom called a Cαatom. In a coarse-grained description, this atommay be chosen as the representative of the amino acid. Our tube can be thought ofas a discrete chain of Cαatoms of the protein backbone.) As we have discussed,the notion of a tube thickness is captured by ensuring that none of the three-bodyradii is smaller than a threshold value equal to the radius of the tube. Let us pos-tulate that the attractive interactions promoting compaction are pairwise and haveagiven range. (Because we are considering a discrete situation, it is quite validto have pairwise interactions, which need to be discarded in a continuum descrip-tion of a tube.) We will need to specify one dimensionless quantity, which we willcallX, that is the ratio of the thickness of the tube to the range of the attractiveinteractions.WhenXis very large compared with 1, the tube is so fat that it is unable tobenefit from the attractive interactions. The constraints of the three-body interactiondominate (the pairwise interaction plays no role), and one then obtains a swollenphase consisting of all self-avoiding conformations that satisfy the three-body radiusconstraint associated with the non-zero tube thickness. A vast majority of theseconformations are ineffective in expelling the water from the interior of the structure.The non-zero thickness is loosely analogous to restricted space that others are notallowed to trespass on. Imagine that your friend sits in the center of his/her room andrequests that no one enter the room. The thickness then is proportional to the widthof the room. If the range of attractive interactions is very small compared withthis size, your ability to benefit from interactions with him/her is compromisedby the fact that you cannot enter the room, and, for all practical purposes, it isas though your interactions with him/her were turned off. At the other extreme,for a tube with a very smallXcompared with 1, one also obtains many, manyconformations. This is because, in the room analogy, your interaction with yourfriend is sufficiently long-range that you have a lot of flexibility in where youposition yourself. From a dynamical point of view, the structures obtained whenX1 are somewhat inaccessible because the energy landscape is studded withnumerous multiple minima. This situation is one in which the pairwise attractiveinteractions dominate and the three-body radii constraints do not matter.On varyingX,wefind two regimes: the phase with an effective long-rangeattraction and the swollen phase, both with tremendous degeneracies, as shown inFigure12.2. There is a “twilight zone” between these two phases, viewed as dayand night, whenXis just shy of 1.

WhenXis large compared with 1, one obtainsaswollen phase. At the other extreme, whenX1, one finds a highly degeneratecompact phase. The twilight zone between these two phases occurs in the vicinityofX∼1and is characterized by marginally compact structures. The figure showstypical tube conformations in each of the phases.crossover that we characterize colloquially as a “twilight zone” has no relationshipto, and should not be confused with, the same terminology sometimes used in thestudies of sequence similarity.) In this twilight zone is a rich interplay of the pairwiseattractive interactions and the constraints imposed by the three-body interaction.This is a situation in which you are able to interact with your friend, but can onlydo so by positioning yourself right outside his/her room.In the twilight zone, a tube is barely able to avail itself of the attractive inter-actions promoting compaction. In this region of parameter space, the forces pro-moting compaction just set in, and one would expect to obtain marginally compactstructures that have the ability to expel the water from the interior. In addition,because the scale of the interaction strength is relatively small, one would expect a"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"232Jayanth R. Banavar and Amos Maritanlow ordering crossover temperature with entropic effects not being too important.Furthermore, the physical picture of a tube (recall that a tube can be thought of asmany anisotropic coins tethered together) leads to a strongly anisotropic interac-tion between nearby tube segments: it is better to position them parallel rather thanperpendicular to one another. Thus, in the twilight zone, one has a relatively weakand strongly anisotropic interaction. Because the tube segments have to positionthemselves next to one another and with the right relative orientation in order toavail themselves of the attractive self-interaction, one would expect a cooperativetransition with few intermediates – the tube will need to snap into its correctlyfolded configuration. Also, because of the loss of flexibility regarding the relativepositioning and orientation of nearby tube segments, one would expect a largedecrease in the degeneracy.In this marginally compact state, the number of candidate tube structures issomewhat limited. The ground-state structures of a short tube in the marginallycompact phase subject to compaction are shown in the bottom panel of Figure12.3below.Tubes and proteinsThere is a truly remarkable coincidence between the structures one obtains in themarginally compact physical state of matter of short tubes and the building blocksof protein “native-state” structures, as shown in Figure12.3. Proteins [14] are linearchains of amino acids, of which there are twenty naturally occurring types with dis-tinct side chains. The backbone and several of the side chains are hydrophobic; underphysiological conditions, globular proteins fold rapidly and reproducibly to some-what compact conformations called their “native-state structures.” In their nativestate, a hydrophobic core is created that is space-filling, as shown in Figure12.4,and water is expelled from the interior. Even though human cells have hundredsof thousands of proteins, the total number of distinct folds that they adopt in theirnative states is only on the order of a few thousand [24, 25, 26]. Furthermore,these structures seem to be evolutionarily conserved [27, 28]. Proteins are rela-tively short-chain molecules; indeed, longer globular proteins form domains thatfold autonomously [29]. The building blocks of protein structures are helices, hair-pins, and almost planar sheets (see Figure12.3). Strikingly, short tubes, with noheterogeneity, in the marginally compact phase form helices with the same pitchto radius ratio as in real proteins [30] (see Figure12.4) and almost planar sheetsmade up of zig-zag strands. It is interesting to note that the helix is a very naturalconformation for a tube and occurs without any explicit introduction of hydrogenbonding. As in the tube case, small globular proteins show a two-state behavior[31, 32, 33, 34, 35]intheir folding pattern."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"12 Life on earth: the role of proteins233(B1)(A1)(D1)(C1)(C2)(B2)(A2)(A3)(D3)(D2)∆PROTEINSTRUCTURESGROUND STATESTHICK TUBEFigure 12.3.

Wepostulate instead that the tube picture presented above is a paradigm for under-standing protein structures. Quite generally, such postulates are of limited util-ity unless one is able to unify seemingly unrelated aspects of the problem andmake new predictions amenable to experimental verification.

Figure12.5indeed shows that, in its native state, the protein backbone can bethought of as the axis of a tube of approximate radius of cross-section () equalto 2.7Å. Interestingly, the tube radius shows small variations, especially in thevicinity of backward bends [36].The marginally compact phase in tubes occurred for a finely tuned ratio,X, around1, of the tube thickness to the range of attractive interactions. Strikingly, for proteins,this quantity is self-tuned around this value. Steric interactions lead to a vast thinningof the phase space that protein structures can explore [37, 38].

The same side chains that determine the tube thickness also control therange of attraction: the outer atoms of the side chain interact through a short-rangeinteraction screened by the water. This self-tuning is a quite remarkable feature ofproteins.The system, being poised in this twilight zone, has several significant advantagesbetween large and small values ofXwith the limited number of marginally com-pact structures as the candidate native-state conformations. The thermodynamiclimit of a tube of infinite length has a first-order transition, on decreasing the tubethickness, between a swollen phase and a compact phase. This phase transition ischaracterized, nevertheless, by a diverging length scale: the propensity for nearbytube segments to be aligned just right with respect to one another leads to a diverg-ing persistence length, defined as the characteristic length over which memory ofthe tube orientation is preserved."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"236Jayanth R. Banavar and Amos MaritanLet us briefly review the well-studied subject of phase transitions and criticalphenomena [39]. Examples of critical points include a magnet at the onset ofordering, a liquid–vapor system at the critical temperature and pressure, and abinary liquid system that is about to phase-separate. The key point is that thefluctuations in a system at its critical point occur at all scales, and the system isexquisitely sensitive to tiny perturbations. Even though sharp phase transitions canoccur only in infinitely large systems, behavior akin to that at a phase transitionis observed for systems of finite size as well. Indeed, for a system near a criticalpoint, the largest scale over which fluctuations occur is determined either by howfaraway one is from the critical point or by the finite size of the system.Amagnet at low temperatures compared with its critical temperature is wellmagnetized and is not very sensitive to a tiny external field. After all, when themagnetization is large, small perturbations do not lead to major consequences.Similarly, a magnet at very high temperatures is not very sensitive to a tiny externalfield because the strong thermal fluctuations dominate and the ordering tendenciesare rather small. However, at the critical point, where an onset of the magnetizationis about to occur, the system is very sensitive to an applied magnetic field, andindeed the magnetic susceptibility for an infinite system diverges.Nature, in her desire to design proteins to serve as smart and versatile machines,has used a system poised near a phase transition to exploit this sensitivity. Indeed, itis well-known that proteins utilize conformational flexibility [40]toachieve optimalcatalytic properties [6]. That protein structures are poised near a phase transitionprovides the versatility and the flexibility needed for the amazing range of functionsthat proteins perform.The rapid folding of small proteins can be understood in terms of the inherentanisotropy of a tube and the self-tuning of the two key length scales, the tubethickness and the range of the attractive interactions. In the marginally compactphase, in order to avail themselves of the attractive interactions, nearby segmentsof the tube have to snap into place parallel to and right up against one another.As stated before, both in the tube picture and in proteins, the helix and the sheetare characterized by such parallel space-filling alignment of nearby tube segments.In proteins, such an arrangement serves to expel the water from the protein core.As shown by Linus Pauling and co-workers [10, 11], hydrogen bonds provide thescaffolding for both helices and sheets and place strong geometrical constraintsstemming from quantum chemistry.Beyond the tube archetype: a refined tube model informed by protein dataWeturn now to a marriage of the tube idea and the wealth of information availablefrom a variety of experimental probes [6, 41]inpreparation for the task of exploring"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"12 Life on earth: the role of proteins237the consequences of our hypothesis. Recall that three-body local and non-localradius constraints describe the self-avoidance of a tube [19]. Unlike unconstrainedmatter, for which pairwise interactions suffice, for a chain molecule it is necessaryto define the context of the object that is part of the chain. This is most easilycarried out by defining a local Cartesian co-ordinate system whose three axes aredefined by the tangent to the chain at that point, the normal, and the binormal thatis perpendicular to both the other two vectors. A study [42]ofthe experimentallydetermined native-state structures of proteins from the Protein Data Bank [43]reveals that clear amino-acid-aspecific geometrical constraints are placed on therelative orientation of the local co-ordinate systems because of constraints due tosterics and the chemistry of backbone hydrogen bonds.Recently, we [42]have carried out Monte Carlo simulations of shorthomopoly-mers, chains made up of just one type of amino acid, subject to these geometricalconstraints and physically motivated interaction energies, a local-bending energypenalty,eR,anoverall hydrophobicity,eW, and effective hydrogen-bond energies.The resulting phase diagram and the associated structures are depicted in Figure12.6.Inkeeping with the behavior of the archetype tube discussed earlier, in thevicinity of the swollen phase one obtains distinct assembled tertiary structures,quite akin to real protein structures, on making small changes in the interactionparameters.The marginally compact phase has distinct structures, including a single helix,abundle of two helices, a helix formed byβ-strands, aβ-hairpin, three-strandedβ-sheets with two distinct topologies, and aβ-barrel-like conformation. Thesestructures are the stable ground states in different parts of the phase diagram. Fur-thermore, conformations such as theβ–α–βmotif are found to be competitive localminima. The specific structure depends on the precise values of the local radiusof curvature penalty (a large penalty forbids tight turns associated with helices,resulting in an advantage for sheet formation) and the strength of the hydrophobicinteractions (a stronger overall attraction leads to somewhat more compact well-assembled tertiary structures). The topology of the phase diagram allows for thepossibility of conformational switching, leading to the conversion of anα-helix to aβ-topology on changing the hydrophobicity parameter, analogous to the influenceof denaturants or alcohol in experiments [45].Free-energy landscape of proteinsMany previous studies of proteins have been done from a physics point of view.The standard approach is to assume an overall attractive short-range potential thatserves to lead to a compact conformation of the chain in its ground state.

This ground-state degeneracy grows exponentially withthe length of the homopolymer. The role played by sequence heterogeneity is tobreak this degeneracy, leading to a very rugged landscape with a specific native-stateconformation, which, of course, depends on the amino-acid sequence, as shown inFigure12.7(b). The motion of a protein in a rugged landscape can be subject totrapping in local minima, and a model protein may not be able to fold rapidly.Glassy behavior may ensue because of such trapping. Bryngelson and Wolynes[46] suggested that a principle of minimal frustration is at work in which there is anice fit between a given sequence and its native-state structure, carving out a funnel-like landscape [47] that promotes rapid folding and avoids the glassy behavior, asshown in Figure12.7(c).Indeed, the common belief in the field of proteins is that given a sequence ofamino acids, with all the attendant details of the side chains and the surroundingwater, one obtains a funnel-like landscape with the minimum corresponding to itsnative-state structure. Each protein is characterized by its own landscape. In thisscenario, the protein sequence is all-important, and the protein-folding problem,besides becoming tremendously complex, needs to be attacked on a protein-by-protein basis.In contrast, our model calculations show that the large number of commonattributes of globular proteins [48, 49] reflect a deeper underlying unity in theirbehavior. At odds with conventional belief, a consequence of our hypothesis isthat the gross features of the energy landscape of proteins result from the amino-acid-aspecific common features of all proteins. This landscape is(pre)sculptedbygeneral considerations of geometry and symmetry (Figure12.7(b)). Our unifiedframework suggests that the protein-energy landscape should have thousands ofbroad minima corresponding to putative native-state structures.The key point is that for each of these minima the desirable funnel-like behavioris already achieved at the homopolymer levelin the marginally compact part ofthe phase diagram. The self-tuning of two key-length scales – the thickness of thetube and the interaction range – so that they are comparable to each other and theinterplay of the three energy scales – hydrophobic, hydrogen bond, and bending –in such a way as to stabilize marginally compact structures also provide the closecooperation between energy gain and entropy loss needed for the sculpting of afunneled energy landscape.Consequences of a presculpted free-energy landscapeRecent work has shown that the rate of protein folding is substantially the same [50],even with large changes in the amino-acid sequence [50, 51], as long as the overall"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"240Jayanth R.

In contrast, funnel-like propertiesalready result from considerations of geometry and symmetry in the marginallycompact phase (b), thereby making the goals of the design procedure the relativelyeasy task of stabilizing one of the presculpted funnels followed by the more refinedtask of fine-tuning the putative interactions of the protein with other proteins andligands."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"12 Life on earth: the role of proteins241topology of the folded structure is the same. Furthermore, mutational studies[52, 53]have shown that the structures of the transition states are also similarand in complete accord with our picture of a pre-sculpted free-energy landscape.Sequence design [54]would favor the appropriate native-state structure over theother putative ground states, leading to a free-energy landscape conducive to rapidand reproducible folding of that particular protein. Nature has a choice of twentyamino acids for the design of protein sequences. A pre-sculpted landscape greatlyfacilitates the design process. Indeed, within our model, we find that a crude designscheme, which takes into account the hydrophobic (propensity to be buried) andpolar (desire to be exposed to the water) character of the amino acids is sufficientto carry out a successful design of sequences with one or the other of the structuresshown in Figure12.6. The matching of the hydrophobic profile of the designedsequence to the burial profile [55] (as measured by the number of neighbors withinthe range of the hydrophobic interaction) leads to the correct fold in a Monte Carlosimulation.Also, as is seen experimentally, many protein sequences adopt the same native-state conformation [56]. Once a sequence has selected its native-state structure, itis able to tolerate a significant degree of mutability except at certain key locations[54]. Furthermore, multiple protein functionalities can arise within the context ofa single fold [57].One successful method of predicting protein structure is based on threading[58]. The basic idea is entirely consistent with our findings. Using pieces of native-state structures of longer proteins as possible candidate structures of a shorterprotein, the technique is simple because, instead of determining the structure fromab initiocalculations, one merely has to select from among the putative native-statestructures. The documented success of the threading method confirms that eachprotein does not fashion its own native-state structure, but merely selects from themenu of predetermined folds.Amyloid phase of proteinsA range of human diseases such as Alzheimer’s, spongiform encephalopathies, andlight-chain amyloidosis lead to degenerative conditions and involve the depositionin tissue of plaque-like material arising from the aggregation of proteins [15, 16,59, 60]. In prions [60], one observes a transition fromα-toβ-rich structures,which favors aggregation and causes the disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy(BSE). It has been argued [61] that the formation of amyloid fibrils occurs in ahierarchical way starting from a chiralβ-strand. The resulting structures arise froma competition between the free-energy gain from the aggregation and the elastic-energy cost of the distortion. A variety of proteins not involved in these diseases"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"242Jayanth R. Banavar and Amos Maritanalso form aggregates very similar to those implicated in the diseased state [16, 59].This suggests [16] that the tendency for proteins to aggregate is a generic propertyof polypeptide chains with the specific sequence of amino acids playing, at best, asecondary role.Let us consider the phase obtained when the tube is sufficiently long (or whenthere are many interacting tubes) and is subject to attractive interactions leadingto compaction. In this phase, the tube is stretched out locally with nearby sectionsparallel to one another (or the tubes are stacked parallel to one another in a periodicarrangement) and does not have the richness we associate with protein native-statestructures. Returning to the protein, one may ask whether some structures are theanalogs of those found in this so-called semicrystalline phase.In collaboration with Hoang, Seno, and Trovato, we have found that aβ-sheetstructure is a significant competitor with a large basin of attraction in a region wherethe stable phase is a helix, reinforcing the possibility that the interaction betweenseveral proteins could stabilize the formation of extended hydrogen-bondedβ-sheets via the aggregation of individual chains. These kinds of structures, whichresemble the basic structures associated with amyloid fibrils, thus seem to belongto the general class of predetermined folds, but this time for multiple proteins, andshould be seen ubiquitously in generic proteins [16, 59]. This suggests that the key topreventing such aggregates is to stabilize helices in such proteins and evolutionarymechanisms such as proteasomes, molecular chaperones [62], and ubiquitinationenzymes [16, 59].Our protein-tube hypothesis shows that long chains of amino acids have a ten-dency to form amyloids rather than maintain their protein-like shape. Indeed, naturehas on suitable occasions thwarted this tendency by dividing the protein into sub-stantially independent domains that fold autonomously and are then assembledtogether. This suggests that the variety of protein folds increases with length up to acertain point at which they are supplanted by the formation of domains or amyloids.In a recent paper, Fandrich and Dobson [63] suggested thatamyloid formation and protein folding represent two fundamentally different ways oforganizing polypeptides into ordered conformations. Protein folding depends critically onthe presence of distinctive side chain sequences and produces a unique globular fold. Bycontrast . . . amyloid formation arises primarily from main chain interactions that are, insome environments, overruled by specific side chain contacts.Our results are in complete accord with the suggestion that amyloid structures mayarise from the generic properties of the proteins, with the details of the amino-acidside chains playing a secondary role. However, our work suggests that instead of an“inverse side chain effect in amyloid structure formation [63],” there is a unifyingtheme in the behavior of proteins. Just as the class of cross-linkedβ-structures"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"12 Life on earth: the role of proteins243are determined from geometrical considerations, the menu of protein native-statestructures is also determined by the common attributes of globular proteins: theinherent anisotropy associated with a tube and the geometrical constraints imposedby hydrogen bonds and steric considerations.Natural selection and protein interactionsNatural selectionTraditionally, the framework of evolution in life works through two aspects of orga-nization, the genotype and the phenotype. The genotype is the heritable informationencoded in the DNA, which is translated through the RNA molecules into proteins.The phenotype is valuable for adaptation and at the molecular level plays a key rolein natural selection. One conventionally assumes that a selection of phenotypesleads to an enhancement in the numbers of the genotype. Furthermore, mutationsof the genotype lead to the possibility of new phenotypes.Let us consider the situation at two levels: the sequence level (which is thegenotype because it is a direct translation from the evolving DNA molecules) andthe structure level (which we can think of as the phenotype). As pointed out byMaynard Smith [64], as the sequence undergoes mutation, the mutated sequencesmust traverse a continuous network without passing through any intermediariesthat are non-functioning. Thus, one seeks a connected network in sequence spacefor evolution by natural selection to occur. Considerable evidence accumulatedsince the pioneering suggestion of Kimura [65] and King and Jukes [66] showsthat much of evolution is neutral. The experimental data strongly support the viewthat the “random fixation of selectively neutral or very slightly deleterious mutantsoccurs far more frequently in evolution than selective substitution of definitelyadvantageous mutants” [67]. Also “those mutant substitutions that disrupt less theexisting structure and function of a molecule (conservative substitutions) occurmore frequently in evolution than more disruptive ones” [67]. Thus, although onehas a “random walk” in sequence space that forms a connected network, there isno similar continuous variation in structure space.These facts are in accord with our result of a pre-sculpted free-energy landscapethat is shared by all proteins and has thousands of local minima corresponding toputative native-state structures – not too few because that would not lead to sufficientdiversity, and not too many because that would lead to too rugged a landscape withlittle hope that a protein could fold reproducibly and rapidly into its native-statestructure. Indeed, many proteins share the same native-state fold, and often thesubstitution of one amino acid for another does not lead to radical changes in thenative-state structure, underscoring the fact that it is not the details of the amino"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"244Jayanth R. Banavar and Amos Maritanacid side chains that sculpt the free-energy landscape, but rather some overarchingfeatures of symmetry and geometry that are common to all proteins. In this respect,the phase of matter that forms the native-state structures is one that is determinedby physical law rather than by the plethora of microscopic details analogous to thelimited menu of possible crystal structures.Protein interactions and functionalityAnfinsen [32] wrote in1973, “Biological function appears to be more a correlateof macromolecular geometry than of chemical detail.” Much recent progress hasbeen made in extracting information on biological function and protein interactions[68] from the structure of proteins and the complexes they form [69]. A proteinstructure chosen from the predetermined menu of folds contains information on thetopology of the folded state. In addition, one can glean information on the natureof the exposed surface and crystal packing and the existence of clefts or othergeometrical features (which are often the active sites of enzymes). The picture iscompleted by knowledge of the sequence of amino acids that folds into the structure,using which one can infer the amino-acid composition of the exposed surfaces, thelocation of mutants, and conserved residues and evolutionary relationships. Forsome structural families, function is highly conserved, whereas for others one canuse the types of information described above to guess the function [70].There is increasing evidence that evolution along with natural selection allowsnature to use variations on the same theme facilitated by the rich repertory of aminoacids to create enzymes that are able of catalyzing a remarkable array of diverse andcomplex tasks in the living cell. The key point, of course, is that a constant backdropof folds not shaped by sequence but determined by physical law is necessary formolecular evolution to work in this manner. Were the folds not immutable andthemselves subject to Darwinian evolution, the possibility of creating many subtleand wonderful variations on the same theme would not exist. The pre-sculptedlandscape is the crucial feature that leads to a predetermined menu of immutablefolds.Other consequencesThe picture we have developed based on the tube-protein hypothesis has severalattractive features. First, as noted before, protein structures lie in the vicinity of aphase transition to the swollen phase, which confers on them exquisite sensitivityto the effects of other proteins and ligands. The flexibility of different parts of theprotein depends on the amount of constraints placed on them from the rest of theprotein [40]. From this point of view, it is easy to understand how loops, which are"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"12 Life on earth: the role of proteins245not often stabilized by backbone hydrogen bonds, can play a key role in proteinfunctionality.It is useful to reconsider how nature uses the variety of amino acids for sequencedesign. The existence of a pre-sculpted free-energy landscape with broad minimacorresponding to the putative native-state structures and the existence of neutralevolution demonstrate that the design of sequences that fit a given structure isrelatively easy, leading to many sequences that can fold into a given structure.This freedom facilitates the accomplishment of the next-level task of evolutionthrough natural selection: the design of optimal sequences, which not only foldinto the desired native-state structure, but also are fit in the environment of otherproteins. A useful protein is one that can interact with other proteins in a synergisticmanner and at the same time is not subject to the tendency to aggregate into theharmful amyloid form. This suggests that protein-engineering studies aimed atimproving enzymatic function should focus on two aspects in a sequential manner.First, the family of sequences that fold into a desired target structure need to beselected, and then a finer design needs to be carried out in the context of thesubstrates and the other proteins with which the target protein interacts. Unlike thegenerality of geometry and symmetry that leads to the menu of native-state folds,what we have here is a problem of chemistry acting within the fixed backgroundof the physically determined structures. These considerations suggest that, whenthe information becomes available, protein–protein interaction networks [71] canbe fruitfully viewed not only as the interactions between proteins, but also as theinteractions between the structures that house them.The two characteristics required for protein native-state structures to be targets ofan evolutionary process are stability and diversity. Stability is needed because onewould not want to mutate away a DNA molecule able to code for a useful protein,and diversity is needed to allow evolution to build complex and versatile forms. Themechanism for natural selection arises naturally in this context: DNA molecules thatcode for amino-acid sequences that fit well into one of these predetermined folds andhave useful functionality thrive at the expense of molecules that create sequencesthat are not useful. Indeed, in this picture, sequences and functionality evolve inorder to fit within the constraints of these folds, which, in turn, are immutable anddetermined by physical law.The situation is somewhat reminiscent of a content-addressable memory [72],in which partial information is converted by the brain to recover the completeinformation. Such content-addressable memories [72], as well as the energy land-scape [73] suitable for prebiotic evolution [74], have been modeled through spinglasses [75]. The energy landscape of spin glasses is also characterized by div-ersity and stability arising from randomness and frustration, which is quite distinctfrom the the physical mechanisms of short tubes in the marginally compact phase."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"246Jayanth R. Banavar and Amos MaritanIn conventional spin glasses, randomness, which plays a role somewhat similar toamino-acid-specific interactions in proteins [76], sculpts, through frustration, anenergy landscape with many local minima. Indeed, a non-random exchange inter-action between spins would lead to periodic order with much simpler behavior.In spin glasses, starting from a random spin configuration, it is hard to reach aspecific local minimum unless the exchange constants are tuned in a clever way,as in a content-addressable memory. The landscape is not invariant on changingthe exchange interactions and can be fashioned at will. For proteins, on the otherhand, our analysis shows that a rich landscape is obtained even in the absence ofany sequence heterogeneity, and the nature of the ground states is determined bygeometry and symmetry and is therefore immutable [28].Summary and perspectiveSymmetry and geometry place strong constraints on the types of infinite-sized crys-tal structures, and there are exactly 230 distinct space groups in three dimensions.Proteins are finite-sized objects. Our analysis demonstrates that the same kind ofsymmetry and geometrical considerations lead to a finite number of protein folds.This number grows with the size of the protein, but is limited by the fact that pro-teins beyond a characteristic length form either autonomous domains or amyloids.Unlike the crystalline state of matter, proteins are characterized by an inherentanisotropy because of their tube-like character. A given crystalline structure tran-scends the material that is housed in it: common salt adopts the face-centered-cubiclattice structure, as do the well-packed cannonballs of Kepler [18]. Likewise, dif-ferent sequences of proteins can be housed in the same protein fold and yet be ableto perform different functions [57]. Protein structures are modular in form, beingsimple assemblages of helices and strands connected by tight turns.The unified picture leads to a single free-energy landscape with two distinctclasses of structure. The amyloid phase is dominated byβ-strands linked to oneanother in a variety of forms, whereas the native-state structure menu is an assemblyofα-helices andβ-structures. Nature has exploited these native-state structuresin the context of the workhorse molecules of life. The selection mechanism forgenetic evolution at the molecular level lies in the ability of the protein encodedby the gene to fold well into one of the predetermined folds and have a usefulfunction. Unfortunately, however, the proximity of this beautiful phase to the genericamyloid phase underscores how life can easily malfunction as soon as aggregationaltendencies of proteins come to the fore. One cannot but marvel at the robustness oflife.The protein problem, which lies at the intersection of many disciplines, is highlycomplex. Evolution complicates the situation even further. Human design allows for"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"12 Life on earth: the role of proteins247an engineer to devise entirely new ways of accomplishing certain tasks – a classicexample is the replacement of vacuum tubes with semiconductor transistors. Naturedoes not have this luxury in evolutionary design. Nature takes what she has, tinkerswith it, and builds on it. Thus, the notion of optimal design is not particularlyrelevant, and the future is very strongly correlated with the present and the past.Aslightly different turn of events could have led to conspicuously different lifeforms. This picture of nature muddling along through evolution combined with theinherent complexity of proteins makes the problem very daunting. Yet, within thiscomplexity, there is a stunning simplicity provided by the fixed backdrop of theprotein folds determined by physical law, in the context of which sequences andfunctionalities are shaped by evolution.Let us revisit the classic theoretical work, shown in Figure12.8,ofPauling[10, 11] and Ramachandran [37]. Both of them considered the protein backbonethat is the common part of all proteins. Pauling and his co-workers explored thetypes of structures that are consistent with both the backbone geometry and the for-mation of hydrogen bonds. They predicted that helices and sheets are the structuresof choice in this regard. Ramachandran and his co-workers carried out their pioneer-ing work more than a decade after Pauling. They considered the role of excludedvolume or steric interactions between nearby amino acids along the sequence inreducing the available conformational phase space. Astonishingly, the two signifi-cantly populated regions of the Ramachandran plot correspond to theα-helix andtheβ-strand. Even though hydrogen bonds and steric constraints are not related toeach other, they are both promoters of helices and sheets. Is this concurrence ofevents a mere accident? The marginally compact phase of short tubes has helices andsheets as its preferred structures. In order for nature to take advantage of this phaseof matter, proteins, which obey physical law, may have been selected to conform tothe tube geometry. Hydrogen bonds serve to enforce the parallelism of nearby tubesegments, a feature of both helices and sheets, and steric constraints emphasize thenon-zero thickness of the tube and serve to position it in the marginally compactphase. Because the marginally compact phase is a finite-size effect, proteins tend tobe relatively short compared with conventional macromolecules, including DNA.Indeed, proteins seem to be a vivid example of the adaptation of nature to her ownlaws.Nature has used several classes of chain molecule – DNA, RNA, and proteins –to create living matter. (Small, unconstrained molecules are not very useful forthis because one cannot associate a natural context for them.) The DNA moleculecarries information and is able to replicate itself, albeit with occasional mistakes.Importantly, these mistakes, which form the basis of molecular evolution, are alsoreplicated in future generations. The RNA molecule plays a key role in translatingthe information contained in the DNA for making proteins. Proteins, the workhorse"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"248Jayanth R.

A single pro-tein may have a variety of capabilities, but the work it does, although efficient,is monotonous. The situation changes dramatically when one has a collection ofproteins organized in a network. These proteins interact with one another, catalyzechemical reactions, turn the gene on or off, and lead to the robust and coherentbehavior that we associate with life.The structure of the DNA molecule provides a beautiful explanation of how it isable to encode information and the mechanism underlying its replication. Proteins,on the other hand, are less well understood. One could ask what kind of a phaseof matter one would choose to house protein structures in order to accommodatethe important roles that these molecules of life play. Our work suggests that a veryspecial, previously unstudied phase of matter is associated with the marginallycompact phase of short tubes with a thickness specially tuned to be comparableto the range of attractive interactions promoting the compaction. This phase is afinite-size effect and exists only for relatively short tubes; it is poised near a phasetransition of a new kind that lends itself to flexibility in the structure; the structuresthat one finds in the marginally compact phase are space-filling and modular inconstruction, being made up of two principal building blocks – helices and sheets;the total number of distinct folds is relatively small and only on the order of a fewthousand or so, and proteins are able to fold rapidly and reproducibly into them.The price that nature pays for utilizing this novel phase of matter is the relative easewith which aggregation of multiple tubes can occur, leading to amyloid formation.In his insightful book,The Fitness of the Environment[1], Henderson extendedthe notion of Darwinian fitness to argue that “the fitness of [the] environment isquite as essential a component as the fitness which arises in the process of organicevolution.” Strikingly, the chemistry of proteins ensures that they are self-tunedto occupy the marginally compact phase of short tubes. One cannot but marvel athow several factors – the steric interactions; hydrogen bonds, which provide thescaffolding for protein structures; the constraints placed by quantum chemistry onthe relative lengths of the hydrogen and covalent bonds; the near planarity of thepeptide bonds; and the key role played by water – all reinforce and conspire withone another to place proteins in this novel phase of matter.Proteins have proved to be difficult to understand because of (1) their inherentcomplexity with twenty types of amino acids and the role played by water; (2) theirrelatively short length compared with generic human-made polymers, which meansthey are therefore likely to be characterized by “non-universal” behavior; and (3)the complexities associated with the random process of evolution. Nevertheless, ourwork suggests an underlying stunning simplicity.

Banavar and Amos Maritanfunction, seem to be determined by physical law and are not subject to Darwinianevolution. In that regard, these folds may be thought of as immutable or Platonic.Protein folds do not evolve: rather, the menu of possible folds is determined byphysical law. In that sense, it is as if evolution acts in the theater of life and shapessequences and functionalities, but does so within the fixed backdrop of the Platonicfolds.Henderson wrote [1]:The properties of matter and the course of cosmic evolution are now seen to be intimatelyrelated to the structure of the living being and to its activities; they become, therefore, farmore important in biology than has been previously suspected. For the whole evolutionaryprocess, both cosmic and organic, is one, and the biologist may now rightly regard theuniverse in its very essence as biocentric.His intriguing ideas continue to provoke thought even as we strive to understandthe connections between life and the laws of nature.AcknowledgmentsWeare indebted to our collaborators Trinh Hoang, Flavio Seno, and Antonio Trovatofor their invaluable contributions to the ideas and work presented here; to MichaelDenton for numerous stimulating discussions; and to John Barrow and PamelaContractor for many helpful suggestions.

DentonThe thesis I shall present in this book is that the biosphere does not containa predictable class of events but is a particular event, certainly compatibleindeed with first principles, but not deducible from those principles andtherefore essentially unpredictable.Jacques Monod (1972),Chance and NecessityThe process of crystallization in inorganic nature . . . is . . . the nearestanalogue to the formation of cells . . . should we not therefore be justified inputting forward the proposition that the formation of the elementary partsof organisms is nothing but a crystallization and the organism nothing butan aggregate of such crystals?Theodore Schwann (1847),Microscopical ResearchesThe laws of light as of gravitation being the same [on other planets]...the inference as to the possibility of the vertebrate type being the basis oforganization of some of the inhabitants of other planets will not appearso hazardous.Richard Owen (1849),On the Nature of LimbsIntroductionIn his great classicThe Fitness of the Environment(1913), Lawrence J. Hendersonexamined the fitness of the basic chemical constituents and chemical processesused by living organisms on earth and of the general environment, including thehydrosphere and atmosphere of the earth, and argued that the laws of nature andthe properties of matter appear uniquely and maximally fit for life as it exists onearth. Towards the end ofFitness,hesummarized his findings:Fitness of the Cosmos for Life: Biochemistry and Fine-Tuning,ed. J. D.

No other environment consisting of primary constituents made upof other known elements, or lacking water and carbonic acid, could possess a like numberof fit characteristics...topromote...theorganic mechanism we call life.(p. 272)And, in the last sentence ofFitness, Henderson concludes with the challengingclaim that “the biologist may now rightly regard the universe in its very essence asbiocentric.”Henderson’s core point – that the existence of carbon-based life depends on aremarkably fit “ensemble of natural constituents” and that carbon-based life as itexists on earth is integral to nature and in a sensepreordained in the properties ofmatter –can hardly be contested. After ninety years, no evidence has come to light ofany alternative ensemble of natural or synthetic ingredients that could promote the“organic mechanism we call life.” However, whether the ensemble is “uniquely andmaximally fit,” as Henderson claims, exhibiting “not a single disability” (p. 267),which might be required to defend a teleological conclusion, remains a questionfor debate.Henderson accepted natural selection as a cause of biological fitness; but, ashe points out, the basic chemical constituents that he examines are features of thenatural environment that existedbeforelife emerged on earth. Natural selectionmay mold the organism, but not theprecedingnatural environmental constituents,such as water and carbon dioxide. In his words: “This latter component of fitness,antecedent to adaptations [is] a natural result of the properties of matter and thecharacteristics of energy in the course of cosmic evolution” (p. 275). InThe Orderof Nature(1917, p. 206), Henderson makes it clear that his argument depends on“a harmonious unity among the abstractchangelesscharacteristics of the universe”(emphasis added). And he stresses that the properties of the constituents he isconsidering are “perfectly changeless in time” (p. 201) and “antedate” the processof evolution (p. 191).The logical structure of Henderson’s argument, which he lays out at the end ofchapter2 ofFitness(pp. 67–71), is quite straightforward. He identifies a key naturalconstituent or process of life and then he examines exhaustively its various chemicaland physical properties that contribute to its biological fitness, arguing that theseappear to be maximally fit. He then considers what othernaturalalternatives mightexist that could perform the same role, concluding that no alternatives are remotelyas fit and that the constituent of interest (water, carbon dioxide, the carbon atom,etc.) exhibits a unique and maximal fitness for its biological role. He then inquireswhether they constitute “a unique ensemble of fitness, among all possible chemical"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"258Michael J. Dentonsubstances, for a living organism” (p. 71). Henderson’s method would appear to be ageneral approach or procedure for assessing the “fitness” of anynaturalbiochemicalconstituent of life for its biological role. (Whether his treatment is as exhaustive ashe claims, and whether the properties of the individual constituents such as water,carbonic acid, etc. are as maximally fit as he claims, remain, as mentioned above,matters for debate.)Henderson’s claim may be controversial, but his thesis is easy to refute. Thediscovery of “alternatives” as fit as water or carbon dioxide for carbon-based life,the existence of only one single obvious “disability” in any of the constituents heexamines (water, carbon dioxide, carbon compounds, etc.), or the construction ofany comparable alternative self-replicating system with cells built out of a set ofdifferent materials (silica, or a different suite of carbon compounds, for example)would immediately undermine the claim that the cosmos is uniquely biocentric:that the properties of matter are uniquely fit for carbon-based life as it exists onearth. If a vast number of different types of biology are compatible with the laws ofphysics, obviously the claim of a unique biocentricity in nature for lifeas it existson earthis fatally undermined. For example, the discovery of life on Mars, basedon a fundamentally different chemistry, would immediately negate the conceptof a unique fitness in the order of things for life on earth. In being easy to refute,Henderson’s thesis is a robust scientific theory in terms of Karl Popper’s philosophyof science (Popper,1965).Since HendersonThe idea that the cosmos is in some sense biocentric has been supported over thepast several decades by the discovery of biocentric fine-tuning of the fundamentalphysical constants (see also the contributions of other authors in this volume), theso-called cosmic coincidences (Car and Rees,1979;Davies,1982; Barrow andTipler,1986). One such coincidence is the “lucky” fact that the nuclear resonancesof C12and O16are exactly what they need to be if carbon is to be synthesizedand accumulate in any quantity in the interior of stars. The energy levels of theseresonances ensure that C12is first synthesized in stellar interiors from collisionsbetween Be8and helium nuclei and that the carbon synthesized is not depleted later.This discovery was made by Hoyle in 1953 while working at Caltech with WilliamFowler (Hoyle,1964). An intriguing aspect of the discovery is, as Hoyle laterpointed out (1994,p.256), that it was a prediction from the Anthropic Principle.From the cosmic abundance of carbon, Hoyle inferred probable coincidences in thenuclear resonances that facilitated and promoted the synthesis of carbon (Barrowand Tipler,1986, pp. 250–5). Hoyle’s discovery was widely acclaimed, not onlyas a major scientific discovery, but also as evidence for the biocentricity of nature."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"13 Protein-based life and protein folds259Hoyle himself commented on the energy levels of the resonances: “If you wanted toproduce carbon and oxygen in roughly equal quantities by stellar nucleosynthesis,these are the two levels you would have to fix, and your fixing would have to bejust about where these levels are found to be” (Davies,1982,p.118).Additional support for Henderson’s thesis has also come from advances in bio-chemical knowledge. Very little was known in 1913 about the critical role of metalsin life (Williams and Fra ́usto da Silva,2003)orofthe remarkable fitness of someof the more complex material constituents of the cell, including the lipid bilayermembrane (Trinkaus,1984, pp. 51–3) and the nucleic acids (Eschenmoser,1999)(see also other chapters in this volume). In my view, nearly everything we havelearned since Henderson’s day about the material constituents of life, especiallysince the molecular biological revolution in the 1950s, is at leastconsistent withHenderson’s claim that the properties of matter are uniquely fit for life as it existson earth (Denton,1998).ProteinsThe proteins have been long invested with a mystical aura. Even the word “protein” –proposed in 1838 by the Swedish chemist Berzelius in a letter to his student GerritJan Mulder (Fruton,1999,p.171), derived from the Greek meaning “holding firstplace” – conveys the idea that these molecules play a unique and vital role inbiology. In hisMolecular Biology of the Gene, Jim Watson, writing well over ahundred years later, remarked:Through the first quarter of this century...themost important group of macromoleculeswas believed to be the proteins . . . [the discovery by Sumner that enzymes were proteins]did not dispel the general aura of mystery about proteins . . . it was still possible as lateas 1940, for some scientists to believe that these molecules would eventually be shown tohave features unique to life...(Watson,1976, pp. 25–6)Berzelius’s choice of the word “protein” turned out to be remarkably prophetic.Proteins are quite literally the stuff of life. Apart from the transmission of geneticinformation, they carry out individually or in groups nearly all the essential activitieson which the life of the cell depends and most of the catalytic functions in the cell.In addition, the core of nearly all of the cell’s supramolecular assemblies, such asmicrotubules and microfilaments, is composed of proteins. Indeed, complex cellularlife would be inconceivable without what Jacques Monod called their “demonical”catalytic abilities (1972, p. 64). The importance of proteins is such that much ofthe cell’s functioning, including the role of DNA and RNA, the genetic code, andthe basic logic of the genetic system, is organized primarily for their manufacture.Life on earth – life as we know it – is in essence a protein-based phenomenon."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"260Michael J. DentonThis centrality of the proteins leads to an obvious test of the “Henderson hypoth-esis.” If the cosmos is uniquely fit for life as it exists on earth, then, given theirprimal significance, the proteins should be anotheruniquely fit ensemble of natu-ral forms(analogous to, but more complex than, the ensemble of simple naturalforms discussed by Henderson inFitness). To show that this “anthropic prediction”holds first necessitates finding convincing evidence (1) that the protein folds aregenuine natural forms determined by physical law that, like water and carbon diox-ide or other natural forms such as atoms or crystals, are universal “givens” of theorder of nature whose basic architectural and core functional properties are thus“antecedent” to the appearance of life; and (2) that they are uniquely fit for theirbiological role as the universal “toolkit” for carbon-based life. If either of thesepredictions fails, whatever else may be true of nature, we can conclude definitivelythat the order of nature isnot uniquely fitfor the special form of modern cellularprotein-based life as it exists on earth today.The 1000 protein foldsThe 1000 protein folds are the basic stable units of the protein universe and aretherefore, given the centrality of proteins in the modern cell system, the very build-ing blocks of all life on earth. The folds are complex molecules made up of severalthousand atoms and consisting of a linear chain of approximately 80–200 aminoacids folded into a complex three-dimensional configuration. They have a hierarchicstructure, being built up mainly out of two well-known secondary structural motifs –alpha (α) helices and beta (β) sheets (see Figure13.1)–that are combined intohigher-order motifs, such as the well-known helix–turn–helix, theβhairpin, theβ–α–β, and so forth, which are in turn combined to form the higher-level archi-tecture of the folds (Brandon and Tooze,1999; Lesk,2001). Each fold is able toassemble itself independently into its native conformation and represents the min-imum protein structure capable of folding into a stable molecular conformation(Brandon and Tooze,1999). Folds are also often referred to as domains (Brandonand Tooze,1999; Bartlettet al., 2003;Wernisch and Wodak,2003). Although manyproteins, such as myoglobin,β-lactamase, triosephosphate isomerase, ribonucle-ase, and flavodoxin, are composed of an individual fold, most proteins are composedof several individual folds (or domains) combined into higher-order structures, asin hemoglobin, for example, where four individual globin folds or monomers arecombined into a compact quaternary structure.The elucidation of the atomic structure of so many such complex molecules hasbeen one of the triumphs of twentieth century science. Many different folds havenow been identified, and together they form an exotic and beautiful set of organicforms.

Indeed, as recently as the early 1950s the fundamental structure ofproteins was still largely mysterious. A remarkable testimony to just how little wasactually known at that time about even the primary structure of proteins is Sanger’s(1952) confession that...asaninitial working hypothesis it will be assumed that the peptide bond theory is valid,in other words, that a protein molecule is built up only of chains of alpha amino . . . acids"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"262Michael J. Dentonbound together by peptide bonds between their alpha-amino and alpha carboxyl groups.While this peptide theory is almost certainly valid . . . it should be remembered that it isstill a hypothesis and has not been definitely proved. Probably the best evidence in supportof it is that since its enunciation in 1902 [by Emile Fischer] no facts have been found tocontradict it.Ideas on the three-dimensional structure of proteins were no less preliminary. Itwas agreed that they were big molecules – macromolecules – probably composedof linear chains of amino acids of up to 100 or more. But just how their primarysequences were determined, how they were synthesized, and how they arrivedat their native three-dimensional conformations was a complete mystery (Hunter,2000, ch.11). It is a testimony to how little was known about protein function thata majority of biochemists considered that it was proteins, rather then nucleic acids,that played the primary role in heredity and formed the basic aperiodic molecule thatmade up the material structure of the gene (McCarty,2003). The question of whetherproteins represented a potentially infinite set of Lego®-like assemblages, largelyunconstrained by physical law and determined by natural selection, or whetherthey represented a finite set of natural forms determined mainly by natural law andtherefore were “antecedent” to life and evolution (like a set of atoms or crystals),was simply impossible to answer.The next two decades saw critical advances that were, by the 1970s, to laythe foundations of a rational and ultimately deductive science of protein form and,finally, by the late 1990s, to support the growing realization that the folds representedanew“periodic table” of complex natural molecular forms (Denton and Marshall,2001; Dentonet al., 2002). The term “periodic table” as applied to the protein foldsfirst appeared inNature(Taylor,2002).Protein taxonomyUntil the early 1970s, there was no hint that proteins might be a set of lawfulstructures determined by a set of constructional rules, “laws of protein-fold form,”that determine a finite set of natural conformations.The first three-dimensional protein structures determined by X-ray crystallogra-phy provided no obvious support for the concept that the folds were natural forms.The apparent irregularity of the three-dimensional arrangement of the polypeptidechain was one of its most striking features. This was a disappointment for Kendrewand Perutz, who worked out the first structures (Richardson,1981). Althoughby the late 1960s the three-dimensional structure of several proteins – includ-ing hemoglobin and lysozymes – had been determined, the lack of any apparentregularity in protein structures, and the great dissimilarity between those that hadbeen determined, provided no basis for a rational classification. The picture in those"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"13 Protein-based life and protein folds263early days was still compatible with the conception that proteins in living organismson earth might be individual members of a near-infinite set of contingent materialassemblages brought together by natural selection over millions of years of evo-lution, rather than members a finite set of atom-like or crystal-like natural formsdetermined by physical law.During the early 1970s, however, as the number of three-dimensional structuresbegan to grow significantly, it first became apparent that the number of protein foldsmight not be unlimited, that the folds mightnotbelong to a potentially infinite set ofmaterial configurations. Increasingly, the same folds were found to recur in manydifferent proteins from many distantly related organisms. Moreover, it was alsoapparent that the three-dimensional structures of individual folds were essentiallyinvariant, some, such as the globin fold and the Rossman fold, for example, havingremained essentially unchanged for thousands of millions of years (Richardson,1981). Fold invariance was a finding that surprised many at the time, as Perutz(1983) comments: “My proposal that the tertiary and quaternary structure of thehemoglobins has been conserved through evolution from fish to mammals has beenmet withdisbelief among biologistsand others, but it comes as no surprise to proteincrystallographers, who have found that homologous proteins in distant species haveclosely similar structures” (emphasis added).As well as being essentially invariant, it became apparent during the 1970s, asmore structures were determined, that the structure of the folds is also basicallyhierarchical (see Figure 13.1), consisting of secondary structural elements such astheαhelix andβsheet combined into more complex motifs (Rose,1979) andthat the same motifs (helix–turn–helix,βhairpin, etc.) recur in many differentproteins (Brandon and Tooze,1999). The hierarchic nature of fold structure and therecurrence of the same submotifs suggested that physical law is playing a majorrole in the ordering of global fold structure and further supported the notion thatthe folds might be a set of natural and lawful structures rather than contingentassemblages of matter.The fact that the folds can be classified into distinct structural classes (Levitt andChothia,1976; Brandon and Tooze,1999) containing a number of related but vari-ant structural subclasses (Richardson,1981; Orengoet al., 1997) provided furtherevidence for their essentially natural status (see Figure 13.1). Levitt and Chothia(1976) derived one of the first structural protein taxonomies, dividing the folds intothree main groups:αfolds,βfolds, andα/βfolds. Inαstructures, the core is builtup exclusively ofαhelices; in theβstructures, the core is made up of antiparallelβsheets. Theα/βfolds are made from combinations ofβ–α–βmotifs that forma predominantlyβsheet core surrounded by helices (Brandon and Tooze,1999).Another early finding, amply confirmed by subsequent work, is that many dif-ferent sequences can fold into the same three-dimensional structure (Richardson,"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"264Michael J. Denton1981; Perutz,1983); in some cases these sequences give no evidence of sequentialhomology (Orengoet al., 1994; Holm and Sander,1996). This suggests multipledifferent discoveries of the same fold during evolution and also that the same foldmay have evolved on many different occasions (Ptitsyn and Finkelstein,1980).This indicates that the higher-order architecture of the folds may be a real andnon-contingent feature of nature (Ptitsyn and Finkelstein,1980).A further finding, supporting the notion that the folds are real, natural existents,is that in many instances the same fold has been modified in minor ways to performmany different functions (Orengoet al., 1994; Gerlt and Babbit,2001). This ismost apparent in the case of the so-called superfolds (Orengoet al., 1994). Onesuch superfold (see Figure 13.1) is the triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel fold(an eight-strandedα/βbarrel), which has been adapted for more than 61 differentenzymic functions (Bartlettet al., 2003), including TIM, enolase, and glycolateoxidase (Brandon and Tooze,1999). Bartlettet al.(2003) comment on the diversityof functions associated with this one fold: “This suggests . . . re-use of the samemolecular architecture again and again.” Moreover, the fact that in many caseswhere the same fold is adapted to different functions, no trace of homology – thatis, common ancestry – can be detected in their amino acid sequences suggestsmultiple separate “discoveries” of the same basic structure during the course ofevolution (Orengoet al., 1994). This further reinforces the conclusion that thefolds are a finite set of ahistorical physical forms.Apicture has emerged of a limited number of ahistorical forms that have beensecondarily modified to perform a vast number of adaptive functions. A remarkablefeature of these secondary adaptive substitutions is how few seem necessary tocause adaptive shifts in protein function. As Perutz (1983) comments: “In theinstances analyzed so far, new chemical functions appear to have evolved by onlyafewamino acid substitutions in key positions.” Thus, changes in only a fewamino acid positions in the globin fold have conferred a vast variety of differentadaptive functions on the hemoglobins. Other proteins show the same phenomenon:a considerable variety of functions realized by a relatively few minor substitutions.Studies of the evolution of new digestive enzymic functions in monkeys and changesin the absorption spectrum of rhodopsin in deep-sea fish (Shozo,2002) all show justhow very few amino acid changes are necessary in many cases to shift the functionof a protein significantly. As Shozo sums up, “avian hemoglobin, coelacanth vision,and langur ribonuclease show that adaptation of proteins can occur by amino acidreplacements at a small number of critical sites.”Considered together, their basically invariant forms and fundamental hierarchicalstructures, the fact that based on purely structural criteria they can be classified intoclearly defined groups, the multiple use of the same fold for different functions,and the likelihood that the same folds have occurred independently on several"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"13 Protein-based life and protein folds265different occasions during evolution point to their being a finite set of “realtimelessstructures” determined primarily by physics.Toward a rational morphologyThe empirical evidence suggesting that the folds are a finite set of natural formshas been largely confirmed over the past three decades by many researchers (Levittand Chothia,1976; Ptitsyn and Finkelstein,1980; Richardson,1981; Chothia,1984;Finkelstein and Ptitsyn,1987; Chothia and Finkelstein,1990; Przytyckaet al., 1999;Srinivasan and Rose,1999). Their studies have elucidated what amount to a set ofrules or laws of protein-fold form that indicate how the physical properties of theamino acid residues in a polypetide chain – and particularly the steric constraintsthey impose on the conformation of the chain – limit the number of “allowable”folds to a surpisingly small, finite number of about 1000 molecular forms. Theseconstraints or rules that govern the way that the various secondary structural motifssuch asαhelices andβsheets can be combined and packed into compact three-dimensional structures amount to arational and generative morphology of proteinform.As we now know, proteins exhibit a hierarchical structure consisting of basicmotifs, such as theαhelix andβsheet, combined into higher-order motifs, whichare then combined into the native fold (Brandon and Tooze,1999; Lesk,2001).The way in which these ordered motifs are generated and packed together intothree-dimensional conformations is limited by steric constraints at all levels of thehierarchy (Ramachandran and Sasisekharan,1968; Ptitsyn and Finkelstein,1980;Chothia and Finkelstein,1990; Srinivasan and Rose,1999).These steric constraints arise at the lowest level from the phi (φ) and psi (ψ)torsion angles (Ramachandran and Sasisekharan,1968) and from local interactionsbetween adjacent amino acids in short sections of the chain that limit allowableconformations to a finite number of conformers, including the two key secondarystructural elements, theαhelix andβsheet (Voet and Voet,1995). At a higher level,other constraints limit the ways in which helices and sheets may be connected intomotifs, and at the highest level different packing constraints determine the waysthese submotifs may be folded into higher-order structures (Chothia and Finkelstein,1990; Srinivasan and Rose,2002).Ramachandran and Sasisekharan (1968) established early that most combina-tions of theφ,ψtorsion angles in a polypeptide are conformationally inaccessiblebecause of steric hindrance between the van der Waals radii of the atoms in the suc-cessive amino acids. In a plot of all possible combinations of the torsion angles –the so-called Ramachandran plot – there are only two small regions of stericallyallowedφ,ψcombinations that together define what might be considered the first"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"266Michael J. Dentonrule or law of protein-fold form. Only one helical conformation simultaneouslyallows conformation angles and a favorable hydrogen-bonding pattern. This is theαhelix, first identified by Linus Pauling by model-building in 1951 (Voet and Voet,1995). Subsequent studies showed that theαhelix is a common secondary struc-tural element of proteins. The other secondary structural element of proteins is theβsheet. This also has repeatingφ,ψangles that fall within the allowed regionsof the Ramachandran plot and also utilize the full hydrogen-bonding capabilityof the polypeptide backbone. Theβsheet structure was first proposed by Coreyand Pauling in 1951 (Voet and Voet,1995). The two basic motifs, theαhelix andtheβsheet, are therefore both sterically preferred arrangements for amino acidpolymers composed of the twenty proteinaceous amino acids. Because of the con-straints imposed by the torsion angles and adjacent side chains, even the supposedly“unfolded chain” is probably more “folded” than commonly assumed (Rose,2002,2003).The higher form of the folds is largely determined by what amounts to anotherset of rules, which determine the way in which these two key secondary structuralelements, helices and sheets, may be combined into higher-order motifs (Voet andVoet,1995; Brandon and Tooze,1999). Inαhelices, several rules explain thedifferent geometric arrangements observed in native protein conformations. AsBrandon and Tooze comment:Rules have been derived that explain the different geometric arrangements of alpha helicesobserved in alpha domain structures. The helix packing in coiled-coil structures is deter-mined by fitting of the knobs of side chains in the first helix into holes between the sidechains of the second helix. For the otherαhelical structures, the helix packing is determinedby fitting ridges of side chains along oneαhelix into grooves between the side chains ofanother helix.(1999, p. 45)Other rules determine the way in whichβsheets are arranged into higher-ordermotifs. As Voet and Voet describe:Beta sheets invariably exhibit a right-handed twist, which is a consequence of non-bondedinteractions between the chiral L-amino acid residues in . . . extended polypeptide chains.These interactions tend to give the polypetide chain a right-handed helical twist.(1995, p. 151)This intrinsic right-handed twist of extended sheets leads to further constraints onsheet geometries. For example, it explains why two consecutive parallelβstrandsalmost always have a right-handed helical sense. Finkelstein and Ptitsyn (1987)comment further:Strong limitations are connected with the handedness of protein structure. . . These limita-tions often permit distinction between two mirror-image structures. The most well-known"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"13 Protein-based life and protein folds267limitation is that two parallel beta stands of the same beta layer together with the connectionjoining them must form the turn of a right superhelix. . . This rule . . . is due to the intrinsicright twist . . . ofβsheets from L amino acids residues. The right-handed connection usesthe “shortest” way and therefore it is not so “stretched” as the left-handed one.Altogether, these lower- and higher-level “packing or steric constraints” amount towhat is in effect arational and generative morphologyconsisting of a hierarchy ofrules that govern the way in which the various secondary structural motifs such asαhelices andβsheets can be combined and packed into compact three-dimensionalstructures (Chothia and Finkelstein,1990; Chothiaet al., 1997; Przytyckaet al.,1999). In the words of Chothiaet al.(1997):In most proteins theαhelices andβsheets pack together in one of a small number of ways.The connections between secondary structures obey a set of empirical topological rulesin almost all cases. . . Subsequently, it was argued that these similarities arise from theintrinsic physical and chemical properties of proteins, and a great deal of work was carriedout to demonstratethat this is the case[emphasis added].Understanding the rules that determine protein form may ultimately allow theabinitioprediction of three-dimensional form from sequence. Already, hierarchicprediction programs such as LINUS (Srinivasan and Rose,2002) and ROSETTA(Chivianet al., 2003), based primarily on consideration of the steric constraintsthat restrict the conformation of short sections of the polypeptide chain, are able topredict higher-order structures with remarkable accuracy.The various physical constraints that restrict the folded spatial arrangements oflinear polymers of amino acids – the laws of protein-fold form – restrict permissiblefolds is to a very small number of a few thousand (Przytyckaet al., 1999). Onerecent estimate basded on possible arrangements of typical structural elements gavea maximum of 4000 folds (Lindgard and Bohr,1996). Others have suggested thatthe maximum is likely to be no more than a few thousand (Chothiaet al., 1997).Brenneret al.(1997) recently estimated an upper limit in the range of 1000 to 6000.An estimate based on the rate of discovery of new folds, rather than permissiblespatial arrangements, suggests that the total number of folds utilized by organismson earth might not be more than 1000 (Chothia,1993).The fact that the total number of theoretically possible protein structures thatan individual amino acid chain of 150 residues might adopt – assuming that eachpeptide group has only three conformations – is 3150or 1068(Brandon and Tooze,1999) whereas the total number of permissible folds is of the order of 1000 graph-ically illustrates just how restrictive the laws of protein-fold form are. Whateverthe actual figure, the total number of folds is bound to represent a tiny stable frac-tion of all possible polypeptide conformations, determined by the laws of physics.This further reinforces the notion that the folds, like atoms, represent a finite set"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"268Michael J. Dentonof allowable physical structures that would recur throughout the cosmos wherevercarbon-based life that utilizes the same twenty amino acids exists.Recently, Banavar and Maritan (2003a, b; see also Chapter12, this volume)proposed a novel tube model to account for the character and nature of the pro-tein folds. They argue that polypeptide chains should be considered as tubes ofnon-zero thickness. When the ratio of tube thickness to the range of attractiveinteractions uniquely characteristic of polypeptide chains (composed of the twentyproteinaceous amino acids) is taken into account, it turns out that the resultant chaininhabits the vicinity of a unique phase transition between a highly degenerate anddisordered compact polymer phase with mutiple inaccessible energy minima anda highly disordered dispersed or fluidic non-condensed phase. The success of thiselegant and simple physical model in predicting many of the key motifs seen innative proteins (Banavar and Maritan, 2003a) and the characteristic marginal sta-bility of the folds (see below) reinforces strongly the conception that the folds areindeed natural forms.A new periodic tableHere it is easy to be reminded of the constructional rules that govern the assembly ofsubatomic particles into atomic structures, generating the finite set of 92 atoms thatmake up the periodic table of the elements (Taylor,2002), or of the rules of grammar,which restrict grammatical letter strings to a tiny finite set of all possible sequences.These laws of protein-fold form represent a set of pre-existing abstract prescrip-tions that specify a finite set of allowable “material forms.” They therefore providefor a rational deductive derivation ofall possible fold morphologiesand thus rep-resent “Laws of Biological Form” of precisely the kind sought after by Goethe,Geoffroy, Carus, and many other biologists of the pre-Darwinian era (Dentonet al., 2002; Gould,2002). And, in perfect conformity with pre-Darwinian thought,protein adaptations would appear to be almost entirely secondary modificationsof primary forms, wonderful exemplars of Owen’s conception of adaptations as“adaptive masks” (Owen,1849; Gould,2002).Although much remains to be learned about protein structure and evolution, allthe available evidence now supports the conclusion that the folds represent a finitenatural ensemble of forms, determined by a hierarchic set of physical constructionalrules that arise out of the fundamental properties of linear polymers made up ofthe twenty proteinaceous amino acids, and assemble into their native forms likea set of crystals through a series of phase transitions (Scheraga,1963; Florey,1969). And, like any other set of natural forms, such as atoms or crystals, thefolds are genuine universals that areantecedentto biology and thus to Darwinianselection. In short, the universe of protein forms can be accounted for by physical"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"13 Protein-based life and protein folds269ruleswithout reference to biology!As Przytyckaet al.(1999) comment: “Fromthe outset chemistry, in promoting structure,predeterminesthe universe of proteinfolds for polypeptide chains in an aqueous environment” (emphasis added). Thefolds represent an “abstract changeless” ensemble of natural components of thecosmos in the same sense as Henderson’s ensemble of water and carbon dioxide.Just as 92 atoms form the periodic table of chemistry, the 1000 protein folds formanother “periodic table” of basic physical, crystal-like structures (Taylor,2002),which form the underlying fabric of protein-based life.In itself, this is a landmark discovery. The discovery that the protein universeconsists of a finite set of natural forms in a sense completes the molecular biologicalrevolution, revealing finally – five decades after the nature and biological purposeof DNA and RNA were first elucidated – the essential nature of the second greatclass of biopolymers. It reveals that the purpose of the genetic system is to turnout endless adaptive variants of a set of invariant natural forms. The great com-plexity of the folds (among the most complex material structures known) indicates,perhaps more clearly than any other previous discovery in the biological sciences,thatvery great biological complexitymay belawfuland need not necessarily becontingent.Jacques Monod’s bold and well-known claim (1972,p.49) that the “biospheredoes not contain a predicable class of events; that amino acid sequences (pp. 94–7)“show no regularity, special feature or restrictive character . . . but rather appearcompletely haphazard, each discloses nothing in its structure other than the purechance of its origin” has proved premature. Indeed, deep restrictions on the aminoacid sequences of proteins imposed by the laws of protein-fold form exist, and thebiosphere does now contain a class of predictable events. Of course, the proteinsmay be unique; but their example does raise the distinct possibility of analogouslaws of form determining aspects of the supramolecular and higher architectureof life. Note that it has taken nearly two centuries of research to reveal the truenature of proteins and to identify the laws of protein-fold form. At the very least,this suggests that the absence to date of any evidence for analogous laws of formdetermining cell forms and body plans cannot be taken to support the view thatnone will come to light as knowledge advances. An intriguing hint that the proteinsmight be heralds of things to come is the recent evidence that microtubular formsmay represent another set of complex organic forms limited by a set of dynamicconstructional rules (Surreyet al., 2001). Indeed, we cannot discount the possibilitythat RNA folds may also turn out to be a finite set of natural forms analogous tothe protein folds (Russellet al., 2002).The finding that the protein folds are lawful natural forms whose inherent bio-logical properties and range of functional propensities are given and delimited byphysical law is (as argued earlier) anecessaryfinding if Henderson’s argument is"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"270Michael J. Dentonto be extended to the protein universe. But it iscertainly not sufficient.Ifthe foldsare to be deemed a uniquely fit, natural ensemble like Henderson’s water, carbondioxide, etc., in addition to their being natural formsantecedentto biology, theymust also be shown to be uniquely fit. Although theirnaturalstatus is in my viewsecure, whether they are uniquely fit remains to be resolved.The fitness of the foldsBecause each fold has been subjected to billions of years of selective fine-tuningfor specific biochemical functions, efficient folding, and so forth, it is somewhatdifficult to judge precisely which properties are universal, generic properties ofthe folds and which are secondarily evolved features. Nonetheless, as James andTawfik (2003) point out, “An evolved function can only evolve if it is alreadypresent to some extent,” and this presumably applies to all characteristics of thefolds. Thus, four characteristics that contribute to their fitness are likely to bebasic, intrinsic characteristics of the folds themselves: their architectural diversity,marginal stability, robustness, and possession of a hydrophobic core.The underlying molecular architectures of the folds are, as we have seen, quiteamazingly diverse. (This can be seen by turning to the various databanks thatdepict the folds, such as CATH; see above.) This architectural diversity is a majorcontributor to their biological fitness, providing the basis for the vast range ofstructural and functional molecular roles that they play within the cell.The folds exhibit a combination of robustness and marginal stability, both char-acteristics that confer important elements of fitness. In terms of marginal stability,the folds are nothing like the rigid conformations conveyed in textbook depic-tions. In fact, the energy difference between the native conformation of a foldand its denatured state is extraordinarily small – about 5–15 kcal/mol – not muchmore than the energy level of a single hydrogen bond, which is of the order of2–5 kcal/mol (Brandon and Tooze,1999). Studies by various groups, includ-ing those of Martin Karpus (Karpus and Petsko,1990) and Hans Frauenfelder(Frauenfelderet al., 1988) indicate that a protein’s native structure consists of alarge number of conformational substates. Instead of inhabiting a deep free-energyminimum, a “V-shaped” bowl with steep sides ending in a unique deep pit (asis often depicted in the literature), the folds inhabit a complex energy landscapethat is more a “shallow U-shaped bowl” with multiple small depressions on itsbase (James and Tawfik,2003). These depressions are the substates, or alternativeconformers, available to the fold (Frauenfelderet al., 1988; Karpus and Petsko,1990), each of near-equivalent stability. Marginal stability is critical during fold-ing, enabling the polypeptide chain to search conformational space for increasinglystable conformations (Dinneret al., 2000). Marginal stability and the characteristic"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"13 Protein-based life and protein folds271U-shaped energy landscape arise according to the “tube model” of Banavar andMaritan (2003a, b) from a “novel phase of matter in the vicinity of a phase transi-tion” in which the folds arise (Banavar and Maritan, 2003b; see also Chapter12, thisvolume). The tube model also implies that few other polymers may exist that willexhibit discrete, stable, folded conformations associated with their characteristicmarginal stability (J. R. Banavar, personal communication).It is this marginal stability (Brandon and Tooze, 1999; James and Tawfik,2003)and its consequence, the ability of folds to adopt many slightly different conforma-tions, that have permitted the evolution of allosteric control mechanisms that linklogical control circuits with catalysis in the same molecular fabric–aphenomenallysophisticated mechanism that Monod saw as the “second secret of life” (Judson,1979). In the case of hemoglobin, conformational flexibility allows the globin foldto undergo “breathing movements” that permit oxygen-free access to the hemegroup by momentarily opening pathways into the tightly packed interior (Karpusand McCammon,1986). Without this physical ability, the globin fold would beincapable of oxygen uptake or release (Voet and Voet,1995). More generally, theability to adopt a variety of related conformations contributes another crucial ele-ment of fitness: it greatly facilitates the evolution of new protein functions (Jamesand Tawfik,2003). Rigid macromolecules not only would be incapable of allostericregulation or sophisticated catalytic activities, but would also be unfit for the evo-lutionary exploration of novel functions and their associated variant conformers.Marginal stability, and the consequent flexibility and conformational diversity of thefolds, therefore confers a wonderful fitness for adaptive evolution – “evolvability”(James and Tawfik,2003)–which has been exploited by life to spectacular effectover the past three billion years to produce the huge variety of protein functionsexploited by life on earth. It may even, as James and Tawfik (2003) speculate, haveallowed “the evolutionary process [to have achieved] great, perhaps unrestricted,functional diversity.”But beneath this marginal stability lies an inherent natural robustness. As self-organizing natural forms, each fold is able to assume its native stable form, as Anfin-sen (1973) first showed, through energy minimization without external assistancefrom any other agency in the cell. This self-forming ability has two consequencesthat contribute to the fold’s fitness. First, it relieves the cell of the considerableburden of having to specify and organize the assembly of 1000 complex three-dimensional atomic architectures, a process that would be costly in energetic andinformational terms. Second, it means each fold is able to maintain and regain itsnative conformation in the turbulent chaos of the cell’s interior, even after all man-ner of momentary conformational disturbances, which may involve anything fromthe movement of a few atoms to the unfolding of sections of the amino acid chain(Brandon and Tooze,1999)."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"272Michael J. DentonTheir natural robustness has another consequence. The authors of a recent papercomment: “A protein’s function is due to a comparatively small number of residues,suitably interspersed throughout the sequence. This process of imbedding functionalresides in a robust framework constitutes a versatile mechanism to confer multiplefunctions upon a given fold” (Przytyckaet al., 1999). The folds are thus able tomaintain their core architectures in the face of considerable amino acid sequencevariation, and this contributes another important element of fitness: it makes possi-ble adaptive substitutions that do not disrupt the underlying fold architecture, andthis facilitates functional molecular evolution. It is the generic robustness of thebasic fold frameworks that permits such sequential “tampering” and consequentfunctional variation.Another general feature of the protein folds that confers an important element offitness is that they generally contain a relatively compact hydrophobic core. Thisprovides a “convenient” reaction chamber for organic syntheses that are, for themost part, difficult to carry out unless water is excluded. The dense hydrophobiccore may also confer on many folds the ability to stack together into various sta-ble supramolecular assemblies that form the basic elements of the cytoskeleton:nucleosomes, cytoplasmic filaments, microtubules, and so forth.Finally, the diversity of the bulk properties of proteins is unequaled in any otherknown polymer class. Proteins form materials as diverse as the hard substance ofnails and hair, the transparent substance of the lens, the elastic substance of collagen,and so on. Some of these properties are equaled by polymers in other classes: keratinby the carbohydrate polymer chitin (N-acyl-d-glucosamine), the transparency of thelens proteins by the polymer Perspex®(polymethyl methacrylate), the toughnessand elasticity of collagen by the polyamide nylon. But no single polymer classhas demonstrated such a variety of diverse bulk properties. The compaction of somany diverse bulk properties into one polymer class, polypeptides composed of thetwenty proteinaceous amino acids, obviously contributes greatly to their biologicalfitness.The fitness of specific foldsGiven the great structural diversity exhibited by the 1000 architectures of the folds,one might expect, from first principles, that certain architectures are more suitedto particular biochemical functions than others. This is true in the case of certainsubmotifs, where it is apparent that particular conformations are suited to particularbiochemical functions. One example is the helix–turn–helix motif used for DNAbinding (Voet and Voet,1995; Brandon and Tooze,1999).What is true of the helix–turn–helix motif may also be true in certain casesof individual folds. Considerable evidence exists for believing that certain folds"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"13 Protein-based life and protein folds273lend themselves to certain functions. One of the clearest cases is that of theBin/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain, a fold found in many diverse proteinsinvolved in membrane remodeling (Lee and Schekman,2004), whose structure wasrecently determined (Peteret al., 2004). As Lee and Schekman (2004) comment:“The structure of the domain . . . seems ideally suited to the task of sensing, and per-haps even generating, membrane-bending events during vesicle formation.” Andlater they comment: “If you were to design a protein domain [fold] for detectingor imposing membrane curvature, you would likely come up with something thatclosely resembles the structure of theDrosophilaBAR domain now solved by Peteret al.” Another instance in which a fold form is clearly suited for a biological func-tion is the membrane-channel-forming proteins – the porins – made up of trimersofβbarrels. These folds lend themselves to the construction of solvent-accessiblepores through the lipid membrane (Voet and Voet,1995). Mere cursory observationof the fold structure (essentially a hollow tube) suggests functions related to trans-port. Similarly, hydrophobic helical folds also lend themselves to the constructionof transmembrane proteins (Locheret al., 2003).In the case of the globin fold, the remarkable way it has been shaped by selectionfor the carriage and storage of oxygen in vertebrates – involving the “breathing”of the molecule to allow the passage of oxygen into its tightly packed interior(mentioned earlier) – and the many elegant and subtle allosteric control mechanisms(Lesk,2001) and many functional adaptations in different species (Perutz,1983)suggest that perhaps few other folds could be so perfectly fine-tuned by selectionfor these specific functions.Towhat extent particular folds are fit for particular functions remains to beestablished, but already I think it reasonable to suggest that if the laws of protein-fold form were more restricting, if they permitted only a quarter of the existingfolds, if they permitted a less rich inventory of architectures (say 250 folds insteadof 1000), then despite the adaptability of the folds many key biological functions,indeed protein-based life as we know it, might be impossible. And I think that it isalso clear that if the folds were more rigid their fitness would be greatly diminished,whereas if they were less rigid they would be incapable of providing the sufficientlystable scaffolds essential for biochemical function in the cell.Uniquely fit?The folds provide the cell with 1000 self-assembling, complex, diverse atomicarchitectures that are all compacted into a single polymer class. Each exhibits anexquisite balance of robustness and marginal stability, which makes them eminentlyadaptable and evolvable and allows allosteric control and a suite of intricate proper-ties ideally suited to the vast range of structural and functional biological roles they"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"274Michael J. Dentonperform. Moreover, the core of each fold provides a hydrophobic reaction pocketideally fit for organic synthesis. On top of all this, the bulk properties of proteinsare unrivaled by those of any other known polymer class.Natural selection has exploited this toolkit to dramatic effect during the evolutionof life on earth. But are the folds a uniquely fit toolkit for molecular evolution, asHenderson’s thesis predicts? Judging their fitness is complicated by the earlier-mentioned challenge of sorting their intrinsic fitness from their evolved fitness.Moreover, in his book Henderson was able to carry out a systematic analysis of theproperties of water and carbon dioxide and a relatively exhaustive comparison oftheir properties with those of other known “alternative” compounds and to concludethat they are indeed uniquely fit. No such comparative method is available in thecase of the folds. Thus, although no ensemble of complex molecular architecturesof comparable fitness is currently known, the universe of all possible polymers andcomplex macromolecules that might potentially possess similar characteristics tothe folds is mainly unexplored. It is even impossible to judge whether differenttypes of proteins, made up of different sets of amino acids, might be more or lessfit than proteins made up of the well-known twenty proteinaceous amino acids!Indeed, experimental assessment of the functional properties of proteins composedof different sets of amino acids provides an obvious means, still largely untested,of assessing the relative fitness of native proteins.In another direction, we already know that many individual properties of proteinsare clearly not unique. Their ability to self-fold is shared by ribozymes (Moore,1999; Russellet al., 2002) and may be shared by other synthetic polymer typesin the future (Ohet al., 2001; Shihet al., 2004). However, RNA polymers lackthe biochemical diversity of proteins, being composed of only four similar sub-units against the twenty different amino acids, and RNA molecules also lack therigid, tightly packed hydrophobic cores of proteins and therefore their hydropho-bic chemical-reaction chambers. The lack of a tightly packed hydrophobic coremight also render RNA folds less suited to form stable filamentous assemblies,such as microtubules and actin filaments, which play a critical role in the gen-eration of the cell’s cytoplasmic architecture. It certainly seems significant that,despite the energetic advantage that would accrue to the cell if RNA polymerswere used for its supramolecular assemblies, no cell today utilizes nucleic acidin this way. None the less, research into the biological potential of RNA con-tinues, and many new and unexpected properties of RNA polymers may well berevealed.In this context, further evidence regarding the uniqueness of the folds will comefrom future advances in protein chemistry and increased knowledge of alternativepolymer types and from research in the fields of artificial life (Langton,1989;Levy,1993; Kauffman,2000; Brooks,2001; Rasmussenet al., 2004), supramolecular"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"13 Protein-based life and protein folds275chemistry, nanotechnology, nanorobotics (Lehn,2002; Seeman,2003; Shihet al.,2004), and new theoretical approaches to modeling the essential properties ofpolypeptide chains, such as the “tube model” recently developed by Banavar andMaritan (2003a). Such models may eventually provide the means of estimatingwhat fraction of all polymers might be capable of folding into a set of complexatomic architectures exhibiting the critical mix of robustness and marginal stabilityof the folds.Considerating the number and relative stringency of the functional criteria satis-fied by the protein folds – self-organizing robustness in conjunction with marginalstability, diverse architectures, a hydrophobic core fit for organic synthesis, diversebulk properties, etc. – it seems likely that few other types of polymer will be equallyfit. At present, I think that current knowledge is consistent with the possibility thatthe protein folds represent an ensemble ofnaturalforms uniquely fit for the “mech-anism we call life.” If correct, this not only would support Henderson’s contentionthat the cosmos is fine-tuned for carbon-based life, but would further restrict thisstatement to the protein-based variety of life that exists currently on earth.A final aspect to the fitness of proteins relates to their evolutionary accessibility,especially in the early stages of cellular evolution, that lie close to the origin oflife. Henderson makes the point that in the case of water and carbonic acid “Inplaces where life is possible the primary constituents [water and carbonic acid]are necessarily and automatically formed in vast amounts by the cosmic process”(1913, p. 268). Intriguingly, many of the twenty proteinaceous amino acids – out ofwhich the folds are constructed – are among the commonest amino acids found inmeteorites and the easiest amino acids to generate in prebiotic syntheses (Dentonet al., 2002). Remarkably, the folds – so fit in so many other ways – are not somany steps removed from the synthesis of the elements in the stars, a witness tothe fitness of matter for the evolution of protein-based life.ConclusionAside from questions of cosmic fitness or teleology, evidence that the properties ofmatter may have played a crucial determining role in the generation and evolutionof life is an important finding in itself. It echoes ancient animist and pantheistconceptions of nature (Jonas,2001, pp. 7–9) and the monistic materialism of thepre-Socratic nature philosophers (Gomperz,1912, pp. 43–79; Copleston,1946,p. 75), who postulated a living cosmos and matter animated and imbued with theDivine spark, the self-sufficient cause of life. In theOrder of Nature, Henderson’sthought also strays in this animist direction, as is evident in the passage in whichhe writes: “No idea is older or more common than a suspicion that somehow natureitself is a great, imperfect organism” (1917,p.205)."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"276Michael J. DentonAlthough the question of whether the folds are a uniquely fit ensemble of naturalforms remains to be answered, the discovery that this elegant set of atomic architec-tures represents a set of natural forms determined by physical law (and therefore thatmany of their generic properties are “antecedent” to biology) not only is profoundlybeautiful and intellectually attractive in itself, but has far-reaching consequences.It implies, aside from the question of the actual biological fitness of the folds, thatprotein-based life is an integral part of nature and may be properly designated anemergent property of matter.AcknowledgmentsIamgrateful to colleagues in the Biochemistry Department at Otago University,including especially Craig Marshall and John Cutfield, for many illuminating cor-ridor conversations regarding the basic nature of the protein folds and to Craig Mar-shall for having worked with me specifically on the nature of the folds.

FreelandThis is a book about whether our universe is “biocentric.” TheOxford EnglishDictionarydefines this term as “treating life as a central fact” [1]; thus a biocentricuniverse is one predisposed towards producing life (life’s centrality is implicit if“the fitness of the environment [for life] far precedes the existence of the livingorganisms” [2]). To date, this unusual idea has been most thoroughly explored (andmost widely publicized) under the umbrella term “Anthropic Principle” in physics[3]. In essence, this principle refers to a suite of fundamental physical parameters,dimensionless constants that interact to imbue our universe with such interrelatedphenomena as a diverse periodic table of elements, a preponderance of carbon andwater, stars that emit energy, and planets that orbit them [4]. It asserts that, withoutclear explanation at present, the constants responsible for this state of affairs appearfinely tuned in our universe to values peculiarly sympathetic with life’s emergence.Even if we accept this view of physics at face value, we remain a long logical leapfrom establishing truly biocentric credentials for our universe. Understanding “whatis” versus “what might have been” for physics must be met by an equivalent under-standing in biology. Thus the interface of biochemistry, where physics becomesbiology, deserves especially close scrutiny. In this context, the first and perhapsmost important point of this chapter is to emphasize that in considering physics andbiology, two fundamentally different sets of expectations collide. Explorations ofbiochemical biocentrism must negotiate the transition from one to the other if theyare to form a coherent evaluation.The reason is that physicists’ claims for a finely tuned universe are centered on theassertion of improbable non-randomness. In particular, the handful of physical con-stants responsible for our universe not only appear finely tuned, but “are, as far as weknow, unrelated to one another, that is each can be independently set yet each mustfall within a particular range to make a universe in which habitable environmentsFitness of the Cosmos for Life: Biochemistry and Fine-Tuning,ed. J. D. Barrowet al.Published by Cambridge University Press.C\u0001Cambridge University Press 2007.280"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"14 Could one predict earth’s biochemistry?281can exist” [5]. Thus, their putative serendipitous values as single entities becomeall the more remarkable when considered together. But to simply extend this searchfor improbable non-randomness into biochemistry is fundamentally problematic.Whereas the abiotic sciences find the confluence of non-random parametersremarkable, biology does not. Indeed, the existence and aggregation of highlynon-random attributes within biology is more than unremarkable. It is a primaryexpectation of a well-characterized process: natural selection. Reduced to a sen-tence, the theory of natural selection asserts that wherever a population of self-replicating entities inherit characteristics from their parents, traits that positivelyinfluence reproductive potential (“adaptations”) are likely to increase in frequency.At a straightforward level, such adaptations might include the ability to control thelocal environment under which self-replication is achieved (e.g. evolution of a cellmembrane). Less intuitively, the empirical evidence indicates that, given enoughtime, adaptation may also include such bizarre strategies as being a gnat or a gnu.All are highly non-random states of matter; but none requires special explanationbeyond established evolutionary theory.Thus, somewhere in fleshing explorations of biocentrism into biochemical detail,we must synthesize the answers to two different sets of questions. Physics mayask: How far forward into biology does the remarkable abiotic non-randomnessproceed? (Does some trick of physics explain the mystery of biochemical chirality[6, 7]? Does physics directly define life [8]?) Biology, however, asks: How far backinto abiosis does natural selection reach? (Does it explain fundamental biochem-ical parameters of living systems? Can it contribute to interpreting the physicaluniverse [9]?) A physicist overlooks this fundamental distinction when assumingthat improbable non-randomness within living systems is remarkable. A biologistoverlooks it when assuming that the universe is just so.Such misunderstandings are rife. In an otherwise excellent introduction aboutwhy evolution is such an important framework for understanding biology, RichardDawkins writes that “physics is the study of simple things that do not tempt usto invoke design . . . even large physical objects like stars consist of a rather lim-ited array of parts, more or less haphazardly arranged” [10]. In a more infamousfaux pas, Sir Fred Hoyle once complained that biologists were willfully ignoringthe mathematics of probability when claiming that random mutation could pro-duce higher forms of life [11]. Dawkins found the productions of physics irrelevantto an account of life on earth (or of apparent design in the universe) because,to him, a diverse array of elements and the ready availability of a stable planet,bathed in the sun’s radiation and rich in molecules of carbon and water, are back-ground assumptions for a discussion of evolution. Hoyle assumed that biology islacking in explanatory power because he failed to appreciate that natural selec-tion is a powerful heuristic search algorithm that acts on mutation to directly"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"282Stephen J. Freelandcreate non-randomness. Indeed, the misunderstandings persist and have transferreddirectly to discussions of biocentrism.Thus, many scientists dismiss any “fit” between the universe and life on earthas a simplepost hocfallacy [12], arguing that whatever hand of cards physics haddealt, any life that subsequently emerged under those conditions and acquired thecapacity for suitable scientific inquiry would find itself well suited to its universe.If the reader substitutes the word “environment” for the word “universe” to yieldthe sentence “any life that subsequently emerged . . . would find itself well suitedto itsenvironment,” then it will come as no surprise that such dismissals often stemfrom evolutionary biologists. But have they correctly understood the claim of abiocentric universe?One of the most widely touted examples of a biocentric parameter from physicsis the so-called cosmological constant: “finely tuned” between a value small enoughto have allowed matter to aggregate into stars and planets and large enough to havepermitted a leisurely expansion of the universe over billions of years. Could biologyreally have emerged in a universe without stars, planets, radiation, and elements?Physicists who reject any anthropic principle tend to either opt for a flat denial thatany good fit exists between physics and biology [13]orrecast the universe itselfas the variable, arguing for the existence of an all-possibilities-exist multiverse inwhich our slice of reality is, quite unsurprisingly, the one peculiarly well adjustedto contain us [14].What is interesting, then, is that these various denials are more or less mutuallyexclusive. How can an interesting “fit” between the physical universe and its lifebe a simplepost hocfallacy if some deny such a fit’s existence in regard to theone example of life that we know whereas others require a multiverse to renderour particular reality (and hence our existence) unexceptional? Indeed, these logi-cally incompatible dismissals combine to outline the central gap in our currentknowledge: exactly how are the properties of the universe connected to those ofthe life that has emerged within it? Put another way: is life necessarily so, and,if it is, then what are the cosmological implications? The answer is of relevancenot only to cosmology and general evolutionary theory, but also to exobiology (theyoung field concerned with the possibility of and search for extraterrestrial life).Even the emerging branch of computer science that takes an evolutionary approachto developing algorithms seeks inspiration here [15].Having identified the question, where can we look for evidence? Asking ques-tions about what life might look like elsewhere in this universe (or in anotheruniverse altogether) is peering into a deep and murky pool. So far, we have exactlyone example of the emergence and subsequent evolution of life in precisely oneuniverse (the “n=1problem” [12]). Yet, as representatives of this evolutionarylineage, we have been studying the story of our descent in great detail. Presumably,"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"14 Could one predict earth’s biochemistry?283our existence, and that of the other living systems that make up earth’s naturalhistory, are illustrative of something: the trick is to extract the generalities from thislimited data set.Thus, the significance of complex biological systems lies not in their non-randomness as a collection of abiotic molecules (this is natural theology of anold [16] and discredited [10]flavor), but rather in what they reveal about life ingeneral, about the sort of life that one would expect to emerge elsewhere. It istherefore unsurprising that those most interested in the search for extraterrestrial life(e.g. NASA’s exobiology program [17]) are chief patrons of research into the originof life on earth. Extrapolating from the narrative of terrestrial evolution to generalstatements about life in the universe is an exercise of lifting current knowledge toa higher level by pulling on our scientific bootstraps. Certainly it requires care, formisleading extrapolations are easy; but it is hardly unscientific by nature. To claimotherwise is to conveniently ignore the extent to which evolutionary theory (andother branches of science) already bootstraps from the actual to the possible, a topicthat has been explored at length by philosophers of science for hundreds of years[18]. Thus, rather than ask whether we could predict the fundamental biochemistryof life on another planet, I ask the opposite question: Could intelligent extraterres-trials predict the biochemistry of life on earth? Our detailed knowledge of earth’schemistry and biology at least has us peering in the murky pool at the shallow end.Other chapters in this book explore the concept of predictable biochemistry bothat a general level (for example, once life had emerged, did its subsequent evolu-tion pursue a predictable feedback loop with the inorganic chemistry of the planet[19]?) and at a detailed one (given that life uses proteins for metabolism, did naturalselection merely “discover” the shapes that are inherent in this type of chemicalpolymer [20]?). Here my aim is to ask whether the fundamental biochemical frame-work for life, namely nucleic acid information (genotype) and protein metabolism(phenotype), was in any sense a predictable outcome. More specifically, I intendto discuss in detail whether and how to broach this topic within the boundaries ofstandard evolutionary theory. The answer informs the question of whether, giventhe physical framework of this universe, evolution was bound to produce a certainkind of life.For those unfamiliar with molecular biology, the next section provides a briefintroduction.

But DNA is noth-ing more than information, a “how to” instruction manual for building an organism.In today’s organisms, proteins are, to a first approximation, the components thatactually interact to make life.Some proteins are structural (such as collagen in skin and cartilage or the keratinin hair and fingernails), but most are catalytic, steering the chemistry that forms lifefrom energy and raw materials. Thus, the classical definition of a gene is nothingmore than a short stretch of DNA that encodes a single protein, and the genome isthe total genetic information of an organism.Each protein is itself a polymer, but here the individual components are aminoacids, of which 20 different kinds exist (see Figure14.2). Thus, both genes and pro-teins can be represented by strings of symbols (e.g. English letters) that describethe sequence of building blocks of which they are made. Indeed, this is exactly howthey are represented in the centralized databases [21] that are currently accumulat-ing the data reported by scientists working around the world whose work entailsfinding the precise sequences for the genes and proteins of different organisms(see Figure14.3(A)).The complete set of rules for decoding (translating) genes into proteins are whatis known collectively as thegenetic code.Given the difference in size betweenDNA and protein alphabets, the nucleotides of a gene cannot be converted intothe amino acids of a protein by a simple 1:1 mapping.

Thus, the words “translation” and “decoding”are quite literal. For example, the triplet AAA corresponds in the standard geneticcode to the amino acid lysine (Lys or K), whereas AGC corresponds to the aminoacid serine (Ser or S), and every gene includes three times as many nucleotides asthere are amino acids in the protein that it encodes. Because there are four typesof nucleotide, and they are read in triplets, there are a total of 4×4×4(=64)codons, each assigned to one of 21 translation “meanings”: 20 amino acids and asingle piece of genetic punctuation–asignal to “stop translating!”In discovering this translation system, researchers found something quitesurprising: the same genetic code is used by organisms as diverse as the bacteriumEscherichia coliand human beings. In fact, it is now known that this standardgenetic code is used by the overwhelming majority of organisms on earth and isthus to be found in every textbook of biology and biochemistry.

In each dimension, the nucleotides are displayed in the same order,U, C, A, then G, and the amino acids are usually represented by their three-letterabbreviations.However, this overview has so far omitted mention of one other importantcomponent: the molecule RNA. RNA is another biopolymer; as its name suggests,it is a sister chemical language to DNA that is also spelled out in four nucleotides.Each nucleotide is a biochemical relative to its equivalent letter in DNA (althoughfor reasons of biochemistry and evolutionary history, the “T” of DNA is equivalentto the “U” [uracil] of RNA [23]). The primary importance of RNA to the systemis that DNA is never directly translated into protein. Rather, any gene that is des-tined for translation is first copied into a temporary RNA form (a process knownastranscriptionto reflect the direct copying, nucleotide for nucleotide, from onelanguage into another); the resulting messenger RNA (mRNA) is what is translatedby the cell into a protein.Interestingly, however, this is not the only relevance of RNA to the genetic code.Many metabolically active components of the molecular machinery at the heart ofthe cell are made of RNA that has folded up into a three-dimensional shape rem-iniscent of protein. One key example is the ribosome, the subcellular machine ofgreat complexity that supervises the process of translation. The ribosome largelycomprises folded, knotted RNA. Although various proteins are embedded withinthis structure, great interest has surrounded the discovery that the ribosome’s pri-mary functional attributes are performed by the RNA [24]. Moreover, the molecularadaptor molecules – known as transfer RNAs (tRNAs) – that effect translation byattaching at one end to a codon and at the other to an amino acid are themselvesmade of RNA. Indeed, Francis Crick, co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, notedearly on that the “tRNA looks like nature’s attempt to make RNA do the job of aprotein” [25]. A decade later came the suggestion that protein-like molecules at thecore of biochemistry could be elegantly explained as “molecular fossils” [26]ofa time long before our modern system of DNA and proteins first evolved. In thishypothesized world, all life used just a single biopolymer, RNA, which performedboth as an information storage molecule (today deferred to DNA) and as a catalyticmolecule (today, largely deferred to proteins). Since then, this observation has beencoupled with a growing field of laboratory experiments to form the “RNA worldhypothesis” [27]. In fact, it seems likely that the genetic code evolved in the RNAworld and that DNA was the last piece of the puzzle to appear [28].This now completes the brief introduction to the central dogma of molecularbiology, the two-step process by which a short stretch of DNA is first transcribedinto mRNA and then translated, one triplet codon at a time, into the amino acids ofa protein."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"288Stephen J. FreelandA context for the questions of biochemical biocentrismImagine a tomorrow in which the world is rocked by NASA’s fanfare announcementthat, after many false starts and red herrings, its latest robotic probe has unambigu-ously identified living organisms on Mars. Scientists, philosophers, and theologiansscurry to prepare an initial response, thinking of implications for a universe that maybe bustling with an unimaginable diversity of life. But even as they mobilize comesthe most surprising discovery of all. The sophisticated remote laboratory – equippednot only to detect the telltale signs of self-replication in organisms, but also to studytheir biochemistry – shows that these life forms are no mysterious aliens: they usethe same fundamental biochemical framework as life forms on earth. Each organ-ism has a nucleic acid genome encoding a complex network of proteins that interactto produce metabolism. Even the decoding is eerily familiar, with small adaptormolecules of folded RNA translating successive genetic “codons” into individualamino acids. Mainstream interest quickly subsides as debates refocus on academicissues of how and when a single ancestral life form distributed itself between at leasttwo planets (see, for example, [29]) and whether we are indeed looking at recentcontamination by terrestrial bacteria carried to Mars by previous NASA missions[153].The shift in interpretation reflects current orthodox science: life originating else-where would evolve into something very different from what we know as terrestrialbiology. In particular, evolutionary biologists deride what we might term the “StarTrekSyndrome,” biologically naive, unconsciously anthropocentric science fictionin which the aliens have evolved toward the ideal “goal” of humanoid appearancein some sort of synchrony with their evolutionary progress toward self-aware intel-ligence. Pointed ears, unusual bony skull protuberances, or scaly skin is all thatremains to hint at the radically different pathways that each species has traverseden route to achieving our “advanced” state of bipedal curiosity. Indeed, the makersof the recentStar Trekseries, perhaps embarrassed by criticism of their science,have recently added the plot device in which aliens were guided to this commonappearance by a higher intelligence [30].So, sweeping aside this anthropocentrism leaves an alternative vision: whereverlife originates, it will be uniquely and unpredictably fitted to its local environmentand will inevitably follow a unique and unpredictable evolutionary trajectory tostates that we find difficult to imagine. This sounds altogether more sophisticatedand open minded. But what exactly is the scientific evidence for this view?

The occasionaloptimistic assessment of earth’s biochemistry as “common sense” [31] tends toignore this part of the discussion, so let us start by exorcising a persistent demonof evolutionary orthodoxy.Evolutionary predictability: a historical contextThe simplest and most general arguments against evolutionary predictability assertthat the whole point of Darwin’s theory was to escape from notions of determinismapplied to the development of the biosphere. The corollary here is that all talkof predictability represents the unscientific graft of pre-Darwinian culture onto alegitimate scientific theory. One of the clearest statements to this effect comes fromGould [32], who wrote that the very wordevolution“has contributed to the mostcommon, current misunderstanding about what is meant” by Darwin’s theory –namely, progress. Gould traces this misunderstanding back to the subversion ofDarwin by Victorian cultural values, as exemplified in the writings of HerbertSpencer [33]. We read that “Darwin spoke of descent with modification. He shunnedevolution as a description for his theory . . .” because of the etymological roots ofthe word, which lie in the Latinevolvere, “to unroll” (especially a book or scroll)[34].Thus, from the early poetic usage to describe the unfolding of a plan [35], “evo-lution” originally entered the biological lexicon via “preformationist” theories1that interpreted biological development within individual organisms’ lifetimes andbetween successive generations as equally deterministic realizations of a preor-dained design. For example, Bonnet asserted that an aboriginal female of everyspecies contained the germ (information) for every individual that would subse-quently be born to that species [36]. He later expanded this view to incorporatechange from one species into another: extinctions were correlated with the devel-opmental migration of species to a higher state such that any and all change in thebiosphere was an evolution (unfolding) of this plan [37].Such thinking had itself grown from the earlier, more general assumption thatlife’s diversity displays an intuitive order, a ladder of progress from lower to higherstates of being. This view ultimately traces back to Aristotle’s “Great Chain ofBeing” (Scala Naturae), but was subsequently adopted by the Roman CatholicChurch and later formalized in Linnaeus’Systema naturae[38]asnatural theology.1Gould [32] ascribes the first usage of “evolution” in this context to Albrecht von Haller. I have been unable tocorroborate this source, instead finding a tentative suggestion from his contemporary, Bonnet, that “evolution”describes the process of organic change over time [37]. For our purposes, the discrepancy is inconsequential:both presented preformationist theories of evolution at about the same point in history."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"290Stephen J. FreelandIndeed, the real point of Lamarck’s theory of evolution (“transformisme”) was notthe inheritance of acquired characteristics (which widespread view he shared withmost of his contemporaries), but rather that of an innate, preprogrammed behavioraldrive of all organisms toward a higher state [39].From this perspective, the “Star TrekSyndrome” has a surprisingly rich culturalhistory from roots in ancient Greek metaphysics through Roman Catholic theologyinto early enlightenment science. All told, by the mid nineteenth century, “evolu-tion” had vernacular currency in the English language with the nuanced meaningof an unfurling plan, and it was this that Gould tells us Darwin sought to avoid. Andyet, as Gould admits, theOrigin of Speciesdoes contain one use of the word, andit is no casual slip. The final sentence of the final paragraph of the book concludes:There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathedinto a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according tothe fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and mostwonderful have been, and are being,evolved[40] [emphasis added].In other words, Darwin chose “evolution” as his masterwork’s literal last wordon the outcome of “descent with modification.” Certainly, Darwin displayed aseemly Victorian correctness in using the passive tense of the verb to reflect itsetymological subtext: from our standpoint in time, the biosphere we encounterhas indeed evolved (unfolded) according to the laws of natural selection over fourbillion years. In other words, hindsight reveals how possibility unfurled into fact,whether or not the pathway followed a predictable trajectory.Likewise, thea prioriimprobability of any particular hand of cards unfoldsinto certainty as the deck is shuffled and dealing proceeds. But the vernacular andscientific nuance of “evolution” would not have passed unnoticed among eitherthe scientists or the general public at whom Darwin aimed his book. Rather, itwould have left them with an obvious question as they finished reading: was this“unfolding” in any way predictablebeforethe fact of history? Even when thesecond and subsequent editions ofOriginincorporated explicit statements linkingthe Creator to the emergence and evolution of life on earth [41], Darwin keptevolution in its pointedly ambiguous position, leaving the question as to whetheror not the simple algorithm of natural selection produces predictable trends andpatterns at a longer timescale. Indeed, Darwin’s debates with Asa Gray regardingthe roles of purpose and design in evolution clearly reveal his personal agnosticismon this issue of deterministic outcomes [42]. He did not reject the idea that the lawsof nature (including natural selection) stemmed from an Ultimate Cause, nor did hedeny that natural selection could lead predictably to sentience or humans; he simplydenied that the pool of variation on which natural selection worked was directlymanipulated by a Higher Hand [43]. Thus, for example, Gould’s statement that"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"14 Could one predict earth’s biochemistry?291“Darwin explicitly rejected the common equation of what we now call evolutionwith any notion of progress” is hard to reconcile with Darwin’s own words in thefinal chapterofOrigin:“And as natural selection works solely by and for the goodof each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towardsperfection” [44].The issue here is not whether natural selection always pushes every lineagethat it influences to states of higher complexity. No one disputes that selectioncan lead to evolved simplicity (although widespread generalizations are suspect –cave-dwelling animals do not evolve general simplicity relative to their light-dwelling counterparts [45], nor do parasites evolve simplified anatomical designrelative to their free-living counterparts [46]). Rather, the issue is what, if any, pre-dictable outcomes would unroll from natural selection? The significance of Dar-win’s theory was not to demolish notions of evolutionary predictability, but ratherto lay the groundwork that (among other things) renders them testable as scientifichypotheses rather than spiritual assumptions.Distinguishing predictable outcomes from orthogenesisThis is not to deny that since 1859 evolutionary theory has repeatedly had to evalu-ate suggestions of additional forces that would steer the trajectory of descent withmodification toward particular ends. Such attempted introductions form a majorclass of what Dennett refers to as “skyhooks” [47]–unwarranted and unscientificconstructs that seek to lift Darwin’s process to a level that can explain the emer-gence of intelligent human beings, the enormous antlers of Irish elk, or any of ahost of other phenomena that defy the imagination as being emergent productsof unadulterated natural selection. Evolutionary biologists refer to such skyhookscollectively as “orthogenesis” (“a view of evolution according to whichvariationsfollow a defined direction and are not merely sporadic and fortuitous” [35]).Some early examples sought simply to fuse a “hands-on” Creator with Darwin’sprocess, suggesting that God has directly controlled the flow of variation fromwhich natural selection has harvested adaptations (for example, Asa Gray wrote toDarwin that he could not but see the hand of God in steering which mutations ledto human beings [43]). Such thinking, exemplified most recently in the cause ofIntelligent Design, is a crude attempt to fit an interventionist God into the mechanicaluniverse [48]. It is but a short step away from Lamarck’s theory that God imbued theorganisms themselves with a desire or drive to “vary” towards ever more perfection.Interestingly, other forms of orthogenesis have taken the other half of Lamarck’sequation, arguing that the internal, non-random drive exists, but is not attributableto a divine hand. Rather, they hypothesize unknown mystical properties of themutation mechanism (R. S. Lull, for example, infamously argued that some genetic"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"292Stephen J. Freelandfactor unleashed a drive toward ever-increasing size in the antlers of the Irish Elk,leading to the eventual extinction of the species [49]).But although evolutionary research to date has found no supportive evidence forany form of orthogenesis, it is simply wrong to infer that all hints of evolutionarydeterminism are connected to this unfounded concept. The error lies in a failureto distinguish between the skyhooks of orthogenesis and the potential for a simplealgorithm, when applied iteratively over much time or space, to reliably producepatterns that are not immediately obvious. By way of analogy, anyone who hascarefully observed the behavior of a colony of social insects (or a wheeling flockof birds or a school of fish) will have been impressed by the high-level patterns oforganization that appear somehow programmed into the dynamics of these popu-lations. Indeed, some have gone so far as to interpret the interacting population asa single superorganism [50].Yet each year that passes brings the scientific community closer to understandinghow a relatively few, simple rules followed by each individual but iterated manyhundreds of times in a single social grouping could combine to produce such elegant,complex, and unintuitive overall dynamics [51]. The whole is, after all, predictableas the sum of the parts [52]. Why then should we be confident that natural selection,operating in countless lineages over enormous periods of time, could not producereliable, if unintuitive, outcomes? Why should the whole biochemical frameworkof life not be a prime example?Current understanding of unpredictability: from physics to biologyWenow know from physics (specifically quantum mechanics) that below a certainresolution deterministic,a prioripredictions regarding any and all matter (biologicalor not) do not just lie beyond our current powers of calculation, but are activelyincalculable [53]. Thus, whereas the winning sequence of numbers for the MarylandState Lottery unfolds into certainty before many disappointed eyes each week, adeterministic prediction of the draw would require knowledge of the precise positionand velocity of all the particles of the Ping-Pong balls in the tombola, and the verynature of the subatomic world precludes such knowledge for even one fundamentalparticle. Similarly, long-term weather predictions remain informed guesswork asthe dynamics of the atmosphere magnify infamous butterfly wing-beats into chaos[54].Both types of event “evolve” (in the strict etymological sense) from possibilityinto actuality only with the benefit of hindsight. But there is no reason to believethat quantum uncertainties will automatically penetrate upward into higher-orderdynamics – it all depends on which particular higher-order dynamical system oneconsiders. For example, itisa highly predictable outcome of human behavior that"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"14 Could one predict earth’s biochemistry?293each week’s state lottery will be largely funded by the least financially securesegment of Maryland’s population [55]. Indeed, a process as simple as diffusionillustrates how a higher-level dynamical process can tame atomic uncertainties asclose to certainty as any statistician would care to calculate. So does evolutionamplify or suppress unpredictability? The simple truth is that no one yet knows.Biologists have no reason to expect that lower-level stochasticities of physics areof any relevance to understanding evolution or to suspect that evolution is therebyrendered deterministic.Tounderstand this ambiguity, start by considering that evolution by natural selec-tion results from two contrary processes. Stochastic mutation acts within a popu-lation to create random variation, but natural selection then filters this variation,steering the population towards specific parameter values for specific traits. Thecontinual introduction of new variation matched by a continual selection toward anoptimal phenotype will lead, in simple systems, to predictable evolution. Indeed, acomputer scientist presented with this description of natural selection as an iterationof twinned processes will immediately recognize the overall process as a simple(“hill-climbing”) form of search algorithm–aset of rules that can find an opti-mal solution to a problem from pretty much any random starting point, given theright conditions. For example, the population might be one of herbivorous insectsevolving, under the selection pressure of predation, to the exact shade of green thatmaximizes camouflage against the leaves on which they sit browsing.Mutations introduce random variations in color, and predators subsequently filterthis gene pool, leaving a disproportionate fraction of the best camouflaged indi-viduals. The important point for our current purposes is that whatever the startingpoint of the insect phenotype, and whatever the variation provided by mutation, anindividual’s reproductive success will tend to reflect its physical similarity to theleaf. The stochasticity of mutation is tamed by natural selection into a predictableoutcome. However, there is no sense in which the insects are striving toward bettercamouflage (cf. Bonnet [37]orLamarck [39]) or that the mutations are leadingthem toward camouflage (cf. Gray [43]orLull [49]). Instead, the random varia-tion is being non-randomly filtered by predators, whose appetites unconsciouslyeffect natural selection on the insect population (Darwin [40]). So if natural selec-tion simply accumulates to produce long-term evolutionary change, then isn’t itstraightforward logic to conclude that all of evolution is deterministic?This was certainly the caricature of evolutionary biology presented when Gouldand Lewontin launched a spirited attack on what they termed the “adaptationistprogram” of neo-Darwinian evolutionary biology [56]. They argued against whatthey perceived as a near monomaniacal form of scientific reductionism that wasattempting to explain the whole of evolutionary biology as the sum of a series ofadaptive parts, each fashioned to perfection by natural selection. The central theme"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"294Stephen J. Freelandof their criticism was that overzealous “adaptive storytelling” can easily lead to theinappropriate atomization of an organism into a collection of well-adapted traits.When the pieces are reassembled, this in turn would yield a misleading picture ofevolutionary determinism to explain the evolved morphology that we encounter asan organism. Gould and Lewontin’s analogy for the loyal evolutionary adaptationistwasVoltaire’s Dr. Pangloss (“It is proved that things cannot be other than they are,for...everything is made for the best purpose” [154]). Subsequently, the claimthat mid-twentieth-century evolutionary biology was undervaluing the evolutionaryimportance of biological constraints has proved highly controversial (see, for exam-ple, [57]), the logic of the criticism has been questioned (see, for example, [58]),the adaptive program has been vigorously defended (see, for example, [59]), andthe general motivation for the critique has itself been questioned (see, for example,[60]). However, in the midst of Gould and Lewontin’s work lie two fundamentallynon-adaptive features of strict Neo-Darwinism that even their sharpest critics donot dispute.Noise and drift: the unpredictability in evolutionFirst, evolution is more than just mutation and natural selection. Evolution is prop-erly defined as “change in genetic material over time.” Certainly, natural selectioncontributes to such change; but so do altogether more stochastic events. Theseinclude the sorts of unusual environmental fluctuations, such as an earthquake ormeteorite impact, that form “noise” against the “signal” of regular selection pres-sures to which a population is adapting. No matter how well an insect matchesthe leaf on which it feeds, it will fail to reproduce (thus contributing to change inthe genetic composition of the population, i.e. evolution) if struck by a wanderingmeteorite. Unlikely? Perhaps. But debates still rage as to the relative importanceof extraterrestrial impacts in triggering mass extinctions [61], and as to the rolethat such events have played in steering the course of long-term evolution [62](especially near to the time of life’s origin[s] [63]).Moreover, stochastic noise extends (insidiously, although less dramatically) intothe very genetic framework by which many organisms transmit their genes to thenext generation. August Weismann [64]was among the first to point out that individ-uals of a sexually reproducing species must necessarily halve their genetic materialbefore reproduction if the fusion of egg and sperm is not to double the genetic mate-rial of each successive generation. Gregor Mendel’s later experiments demonst-rated that genetic material is made up of numerous particulate genes and that eachorganism of a sexually reproducing species carries two versions (alleles) of everygene. The cellular division process of meiosis, by which such organisms producegametes with half the “normal” complement of genetic material, is usually a lottery"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"14 Could one predict earth’s biochemistry?295in which each member of a pair of alleles stands a 50 percent chance of making thephysical transition into a specific daughter cell.2As a result, even in the absence ofnatural selection, allele frequencies evolve through an extensive binomial samplingprocess as each generation reproduces. The inherent sampling error (“genetic drift”)is as entirely random and without direction as it is absolutely unavoidable. In a largepopulation, the effects are negligible, and population geneticists typically refer toan effective population size above several hundreds as “infinite” in this sense. Butstochasticity is built into the system, and who is to say that relatively sudden, rela-tively drastic reductions in population size have never unleashed genetic drift at animportant juncture in the evolution of life on earth (see, for example, [65])?The second problem with assuming that natural selection accumulates into deter-ministic macroevolution adds weight to this question mark. It is the observation thatthe reliability with which natural selection (or any other heuristic search) produces aspecific outcome is influenced by key features of the possibility space within whichit operates. This can be illustrated by using the notion of a fitness landscape (seeFigure14.4)[67] within which a phenotype composed ofntraits is represented asan (n+ 1)-dimensional surface; the final dimension (“height”) is the implied fitnessof a phenotype. Returning to the evolving population of herbivorous insects, wemight assume that an individual’s fitness is defined by two quantifiable traits, say“color” (light absorption wavelength) and “age to sexual maturity.”In such a world, the fitness landscape exists in three dimensions (see Figure14.4(A)). In this construct, it becomes clear why the simple iteration of mutation andnatural selection is called a “hill-climbing” heuristic search algorithm: Mutationsform random steps in any direction from the initial genotype, but natural selectionfavors those that result in an individual of higher fitness (one that resides farther upthe hill; see Figure14.4(B)). The result is that the average genotype of the populationprogresses toward the optimum. The problem is that hill-climbing algorithms tendto find and become stuck at the nearest optimum to the starting position (i.e. atlocal optima) even when superior optima exist elsewhere on the landscape. Thismatters because the adaptive landscape for any real-world organism is likely to beextremely high-dimensional, containing numerous distinct, isolated local optima.Thus, in any “adaptive walk,” the precise nature of the first few mutations (each anoutcome of a stochastic process) may influence exactly which adaptive peak naturalselection subsequently approaches. In other words, were two genetically identicalpopulations to experience exactly the same novel selection pressure(s), then eachwould follow a different evolutionary pathway to a different optimal solution.2In some cases, “ultra-selfish” genes evolve to cheat this process. In particular, alleles known variously as “meioticdrivers” or “segregation distorters” ensure that they end up in the only viable gametes that are produced. Theoryand data surrounding the general phenomenon of intragenomic conflict are still relatively new, and the degree towhich this potentially important phenomenon influences broad patterns of macroevolution is difficult to assess[66]."},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"296Stephen J. Freeland(B)optimalphenotype(A)Figure 14.4. (A) The adaptive landscape represents the “possibility space” of phe-notypes as surface, with every combination of values for traits 1,...,N(co-ordinatesin dimensions 1,...,Nof the landscape) associated with a fitness value (dimensionn+1,drawn here as “height”). In this case, two traits define fitness in a simple land-scape for which there is only one optimal combination of trait values; thus (B) inan evolving population that exhibits phenotypic variation (shown here as a clusterof circles on the landscape), the fittest individuals are those closest to this opti-mum (shown as dark circles), and the least fit are those farthest from the optimum(shown as light circles). Thus, through iterated, fitness-dependent reproduction,the population “climbs” to the adaptive peak.Influential figures of twentieth-century neo-Darwinism have placed centralemphasis on this effect for the very process by which new species form. In particu-lar, Mayr’s [68] classic model for the formation of new species asserts that a criticalfirst step is the isolation of a small subpopulation during which event stochastic-sampling error (perhaps coupled to a brief period of genetic drift as the populationrecovers to an appreciable size) triggers adaptive evolution to a new adaptive peak.Thus, extraterrestrial impacts near to life’s origin(s) could have reduced primordialpopulations to a point where genetic drift set the evolutionary course by whichfundamental biochemistry emerged.So, should we not only reject the na ̈ıve idea that natural selection inevitably pro-duces long-term evolutionary predictability, but further conclude that the stochas-ticity of mutation creates the existence of genetic drift and also that the frame-work of hideously complex adaptive landscapes combine to render evolutionaryunpredictability inevitable? This is perhaps as close to orthodoxy as generaliza-tion will allow. For example, in rebutting Gould and Lewontin’s [56] critique ofthe adaptationist program, the arch proponent of natural selection G. C. Williams"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"14 Could one predict earth’s biochemistry?297simultaneously defended the role of the adaptive program in advancing evolutionarytheory while emphasizing that adaptation could only ever be to the local conditions[59]. In short, evolution might be producing good design all around, but the globaloptima that an intelligent engineer mightpredictcould be consistently overlookedby the natural selection’s myopic tendency for local hill climbing.Indeed, this viewpoint arguably reached its most famous and focused expo-sition when, some fifteen years after dismissing evolutionary determinism as acultural hangover from Victorian philosophy, Gould’s bookWonderful Lifecre-ated the catchy sound-bite of “replaying life’s tape...you press the rewindbutton...then let the [evolution of life on earth] run again and see if the rep-etition looks anything like the original” [69]. The book’s thesis is a protractedargument that the long-term outcomes of evolution are unpredictable and that self-aware humans are an extremely unlikely, happy accident. The claim was based oncommon sense regarding the unpredictability of the environment in which organ-isms are adapting. Our world is one in which stochastic noise, from fluctuationsin seasonal temperatures and precipitation to the occasional impact of huge mete-orites and the intricate maneuverings of plate tectonics, keep throwing the dicefor evolving populations. If each population’s long-term evolutionary trajectory iscontingent on numerous accidents of history, then surely long-term evolution isunpredictable?Allowing the data to leadBut common sense (more accurately called “intuition”) is rarely the friend ofscience: the data must lead and opinions follow. Indeed, humans historically havedisplayed an impressive ineptitude for accurate intuition about biological evolution.The primary breakthrough of evolutionary thinking [70]was to expose Aristotle’sfundamental “common sense” notion of naturally discrete categorical types as alargely subjective invention of human thought when applied to the natural worldof species.3Of greater relevance to the issue at hand, the common sense of old-school natural theology’s “arguments from design” (that a mechanical universecould not produce organisms so exquisitely suited to their environments) has fallento data, hypothesis, and experiment. Even Mayr’s view of stochastic speciation [68]is coming under increasing pressure from the empirical data [73]. The question formacroevolutionary predictability, then, is whether similarly counterintuitive dataare waiting in the wings, ready to redefine common sense.3Indeed, field biologists have subsequently uncovered so many examples where two or more “species” blendconfusingly into one another [71] that even scientifically literate creationists have found themselves maneuveredinto reassigning the point of divine creation somewhat farther up the taxonomic hierarchy: a level somewherebetween “family” and “genus” is a typical, if arbitrary, focal point in such circles at present [72]."},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"298Stephen J. FreelandInterestingly, research from the computer science community has shown that thevery process of stochastic drift that forms one half of Neo-Darwinian argumentsfor evolutionary non-predictability may go some way to solving the problem ofmultiple adaptive peaks that forms the other half of such arguments. Specifically,if a local hill-climbing algorithm is allowed periodic bursts of random geneticdrift, then this can free the evolving population to wander far from local optima.The subsequent re-implementation of natural selection finds the population on thefoothills of an alternative adaptive peak [74]. The probability that a short burst ofdrift will dislodge an evolving population from its current hilltop to the foothills ofanother peak is inversely proportional to the size of the peak it currently occupies.Because global optima are, by definition, higher than local optima, bursts of driftcan actually help populations to find global optima with greater predictability. Butsimulating evolutionary dynamics on complex landscapes is still a minor field, notleast because of difficulties in accurately rendering real-world populations to thistheoretical construct. Thus we turn to empirical data.In this context, Conway Morris’ recent bookLife’s Solution: Inevitable Humansin a Lonely Universe[75] brings a broad range of contemporary evidence to chal-lenge common sense. It derives an antithesis to assertions of long-term evolutionaryunpredictability by re-evaluating the fundamental notion that no specific pathwaythrough a complex, branching “possibility tree” could be inevitable. To test thisassertion, Conway Morris focuses on case studies where the evolution of multiplelineages has seen them converge on similar morphologies, reflecting an optimalsolution to the challenges of maximizing fitness (a self-replicating system’s self-replication potential). His conclusion is that complex evolutionary convergence isfar more widespread than contemporary wisdom would anticipate. The inferenceis that natural selection seems to navigate through the randomness of this worldto “locate” similar, optimal solutions, almost regardless of the starting point. Anextreme role for selection pressure at each node in a long series of branching pos-sibilities does not transform blind chance into deterministic certainty, but it doessuggest that adaptive evolution can navigate complex fitness landscapes to arrivewith surprising predictability at specific outcomes. But how then do we move froma broad consideration of the macroevolutionary landscape to an explicit evaluationof the fundamental biochemistry of life?Resolvingn=1: from comparative analysis to optimality studiesConway Morris’ focus on convergence exemplifies one general approach to study-ing adaptation: he infers the footprint of natural selection by demonstrating thata particular trait has evolved repeatedly beyond the expectations of chance. Themethodology for such analyses has been formalized as the Comparative Method"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"14 Could one predict earth’s biochemistry?299[76], by which patterns of evolutionary outcomes are mapped onto an associatedtree of evolutionary relationships to test their statistical significance. However, thelimitation of this approach is that it applies only to evolutionary phenomena forwhich multiple, independently derived examples exist. Indeed, the very essence ofthe analysis is to show that similar phenomena have evolved independently withsignificant regularity.In considering the question of fine-tuning within biochemistry, some of the mostrelevant phenomena are of interest because they were universal to the primordiallife that subsequently spawned today’s biosphere. In particular, during the earlyevolution of life on earth (defined as the interval between the origin of life andthe organism that formed the “Last Universal Ancestor” of all extant life), allorganisms followed a similar pattern: all came to use lipid membranes to partitiona local environment for metabolism; all came to use nucleic acid to encode geneticinformation in a linear sequence (Schr ̈odinger’s predicted “aperiodic crystal” [8]);all came to use an alphabet of exactly four such chemical letters to spell out theirgenetic messages; all came to use DNA for genetic information storage and proteinsfor metabolically active molecules; all came to construct proteins from an alphabetof 20 amino acids; all came to transform genes into living organisms; all came touse an identical genetic code. Although in a few cases these universal constantshave subsequently weakened into standards (some viruses have re-evolved an RNAgenome [77], some twigs on the tree of life have evolved minor changes to therules of their genetic code [78], and some lineages have even added one or twoamino acids to their protein alphabet [79]), they form the platform on which allsubsequent evolution has built. Their significance to understanding the fit betweenthis universe and its life is as fundamental as that of the cosmological constant.But we cannot interpret the near-ubiquity of such phenomena throughout themany branches of the tree of life as a sign of adaptive value via the comparativemethod. The problem is that here, widespread distribution derives from sharedancestry rather than from convergence. Although designs of natural selection maybe blind with respect to future potential, they are less so to the antecedent(s) onwhich they build. Specifically, the probability that a mutation is advantageous isinversely proportional to the magnitude of its effect [80]. Consequently, “Evo-lution is a tinkerer” [81] that tends to construct at the edges of an increasinglyconstrained foundation. As organisms evolve, characteristics that emerged earlyon become “locked in” by an increasing number of evolutionary epiphenomenathat make adaptive sense only in relation to them. In short, evolutionary conver-gence from different starting points is far better evidence of adaptation (and hencepredictability) than a failure to diverge from a common starting point.Thus, each biochemical standard may have arisen by chance and then beenevolutionarily frozen into place. A striking example of such thinking was Crick’s"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"300Stephen J. Freelandexplanation [82] for why the same genetic code is found in organisms as diverse asE. coliandHomo sapiens.Henoted that an organism’s entire genome uses one com-mon set of decoding rules to convert genetic information into proteins. Thus, onceany genetic code is in place, the fitness of all protein-coding genes in the genomedepends implicitly on these decoding rules. Whereas Neo-Darwinism asserts thatoccasionally a single mutation within a gene might prove advantageous, to mutateany of the decoding rules themselves would amount to simultaneously introducingcountless mutations throughout an organism’s genetic material. Selection pressureagainst variation, Crick argued, could explain why the same genetic code was usedby all organisms: not because it was an adaptive state in every lineage, but becauseit was a “frozen accident” of evolutionary history.However, other interpretations of the code surfaced around the same time. Inparticular, they focused on the observation that any code mapping 64 codons to just20 amino acids will be redundant in that at least some amino acids will be specifiedby more than one codon. The standard genetic code is decidedly non-random in thisrespect: although redundancy is distributed between most amino acids, synonymouscodons (i.e. those that code for the same amino acid) are typically clustered together,sharing two out of three nucleotides (see Figure14.3(B)). Two researchers suggestedthat this non-random distribution might buffer genomes against the effects of pointmutation (a common type of mutation in which a single nucleotide of DNA isaltered) and proposed natural selection as an explanation [83, 84]. Soon after,another researcher noted a more subtle pattern: that amino acids sharing similarbiochemical properties are also clustered within the code, such that even wheresingle point mutationsdolead to a change in amino acid meaning, they tend tosubstitute an amino acid similar to that specified by the unmutated codon [85]. Butthen Crick’s “wobble hypothesis” proposed that the block pattern of synonymouscodons could have resulted from nothing more than biophysical constraints on thespecificity with which a tRNA can recognize its cognate codons [86]. The biologicalcommunity was still reacting to the spectacular collapse of several high-profilehypotheses that had previously predicted how the code would be found to work.Each was extremely elegant, but had been proven wrong by empirical evidence[87]. Thus, the “frozen accident” argument for the impossibility of code evolution,backed by the apparent universality of the standard genetic code, carried the day.The genetic code: from “frozen accident” to predictable adaptationMore than a decade later, the situation changed when researchers discovered the firstexample of a naturally occurring, non-standard genetic code [88]. Subsequently,further examples of variations in codon assignments have been uncovered in a dis-parate group of evolutionary lineages [78]. Each is a minor variation of the standardcode, and most occur in simple genomes with few genes. However, these findings"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"14 Could one predict earth’s biochemistry?301joined with plausible mechanisms of codon reassignment [89]toseriously under-mine the intuitively simple logic of the frozen accident hypothesis. This in turnreopened the door to discussions of the possibility that natural selection had steeredthe evolution of codon assignments within the standard genetic code. The chal-lenge was to go farther than noting features of the standard genetic code that makeadaptive sense, to formally test whether the standard genetic code is significantlynon-random with respect to plausible alternatives. This approach represents anexample of a another well-established, general technique for evaluating evolution-ary outcomes: Optimality Theory [90], a form of what physicists recognize by thedescription “counterfactual investigation.” Optimality theory has been widely usedto study evolutionary outcomes that range from animal behavior [91]togenomestructure [92]. Thus, Haig and Hurst [93] calculated the average change in aminoacid hydrophobicity caused by all possible point mutations within the standardgenetic code and compared this value with equivalent measures calculated for alarge sample of theoretical alternative codes. Results showed that around one inten thousand random patterns of codon assignments would buffer genomes againstthe impact of mutation as well as or better than the standard genetic code. Furtherwork went on to show that more sophisticated calculations of error susceptibility,adjusted to reflect known biases in the patterns within which codons mutate or aremistranslated, reduce this figure by two further orders of magnitude, so that thestandard genetic code appears to be literally one in a million [94] (see Figure14.5).A full description of how the adaptive theory developed and where it stands todayis beyond the scope of this chapter; details are recorded elsewhere [95]. Suffice itto say the evidence that the pattern of codon assignments found within the standardgenetic code is a product of natural selection has grown in volume and detail. Indeed,a growing network of analysis is painting a picture of a genetic code that originatedthrough deterministic biochemical interactions between nucleic acid motifs andafewamino acids [96] and grew in complexity by incorporating biochemicallymodified derivatives of these original amino acids [97] and navigated by naturalselection toward a specific, optimal pattern of codon/amino acid assignments [98].Precise details of one of the fundamental features at the heart of life’s biochemistrythus appear to be anything but a frozen accident of evolutionary history. Rather,the discovery of such an “attractor” gives one clear indication of a predictableevolutionary outcome. We might not see exactly the same code a second timearound, but perhaps we should expect to see one with strikingly similar features.Beyond predictable codon assignmentsOf course, these findings remain tightly constrained within assumptions (for exam-ple, that we are dealing with nucleic acid genotype mapped to protein phenotypeby a code of triplet nucleotides, drawn from an alphabet of 4, each encoding one of"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"302Stephen J.

Every one of these parameters is worthy of exploration for adap-tive significance. Together, they pose a network of questions amenable to scientificinvestigation. Answers here will start to yield a robust picture of the predictabilityfor life’s biochemical framework. Many of these biochemical fundamentals havebeen investigated already to some extent, but progress in formalizing such inquiriesand synthesizing the results has been patchy (more thorough expositions of whatfollows may be found in [99] and [100]).Forexample, the amino acid alphabet has received an enormous amount ofattention in terms of its origins. The groundbreaking work of Miller and Ureydemonstrated that, under plausible prebiotic conditions, close to half of the 20 aminoacids found in the standard genetic code can be reliably produced in significantquantities by simple abiotic processes (originally an electric spark applied to amixture of steam, ammonia, and methane) [101]. Subsequent work has shown thatthe precise source of energy, and even the precise gaseous mixture, can vary withoutsignificantly changing the results [102]; further research suggests that a similar setof amino acids is probably synthesized abiotically throughout the universe [103,104]. A careful compendium of this evidence indicates a fairly high degree ofagreement as to which amino acids were likely available to the earliest life forms"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"14 Could one predict earth’s biochemistry?303and which were “invented” by early metabolism [105]. Although detailed assertionsregarding the precise order in which this latter group of amino acids entered thecode [106]have proved unpersuasive [107, 108], attempts to collate clues continue[109, 110].This understanding of how the amino acid alphabet began, how it grew, and bywhat mechanism it grew only partly addresses the evolution of the code. Severalhundred biochemical derivatives of the standard code’s 20 amino acids are producedand used in the metabolism of extant life, but have never been incorporated intothe code. Moreover, many amino acids are routinely produced in abiotic syntheses,buthavenoknown place in biology. The question of why life “chose” the 20that we see in the standard genetic code is largely unanswered – indeed, the onlydirect commentary on nature’s choice of amino acids has concluded that only someaspects seem to make sense [111]. Certainly, their ready synthesis under abioticconditions suggests that they are reasonable components to find at the center of life’sbiochemistry. Moreover, this analysis offers a simple adaptive explanation as towhy analogous organic monomers, also produced abundantly by abiotic syntheses,each with the potential to form linear protein-like polymers, would have beenpassed over in favor of alpha amino acids by primordial evolution. Specifically,the argument concerns a protein’s potential to fold into a stable, three-dimensionalshape with specific catalytic or structural properties; amino acid equivalents withlonger or shorter “backbones” produce polymers that are too rigid or too flexible toproduce useful, reliable structures. Emerging technology is starting to explore theconformational stability of folded biopolymers that contain uncoded amino acids[112]. As computing power and accessibility continue to increase, software thatapplies this theory to predict the properties of arbitrary folds is growing in power[113]. Weber and Miller’s [111] suggestion is ripe for further investigation.Even less work has tackled the related issue of whether the amino acid alphabetsize of 20 is in some way optimal or a mere accident of history. Recent discover-ies of some lineages that encode up to 22 amino acids merely re-emphasize that20 is unlikely to be a frozen accident. Yet to date, the only attempts to test foran optimal amino acid alphabet size have been tucked in as afterthoughts withinpublications pursuing a fundamentally different theme [114, 115]. The impedimentto detailed research here is our generally poor understanding of how amino acidsequence maps into folded structure (and our even weaker general predictive poweroverhowsequence determines function). Previous attempts to produce functionalmolecules from reduced alphabets of amino acids have met with limited success[116]. However, the enormous scientific [117] and economic [118] motivation tobe able to accurately predict protein structure and “rationally design” proteins isleveraging progress [119]. In addition, innovative experimental techniques are start-ing to broaden possibilities for investigating structure/function mapsin vitro[120]."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"304Stephen J. FreelandPerhaps, in the not-too-distant future, meaningful optimality studies will explorerealistically the link between protein structure and the amino acid alphabet. Mean-while, it would seem pertinent to extend optimality studies of the standard geneticcode to explore the properties of codes with fewer, more, or different amino acidswith respect to the canonical 20.For the nucleotides, the situation described for amino acids is almost preciselyreversed. We know that many non-biological nucleotides are possible [121]. Indeed,many are used outside of genetics within extant metabolism [122]. Several focusedoptimality studies have offered detailed explanations for the size and compositionof the genetic alphabet used by life [123]. Even the choice of ribose as the sugarcomponent of nucleic acid has been proposed to be optimal for base-pairing strengthrelative to other prebiotically plausible alternatives [124]. Assuming that nucleicacid is on the table, the details of life’s genetic biochemistry appear to be more orless predictable.Yet this assumption is a problem. The very existence of nucleic acids withinbiochemistry remains one of the larger mysteries of primordial evolution. It is notat all clear that nucleic acid would have been on the primordial table (at least withinthe soup appetizer). Certainly, nucleic acid presents some highly attractive featuresas the genetic [125] and even catalytic [27] start of life. Some regard it as an obvi-ous choice for the core of biochemistry [126]. None the less, prebiotic simulationsappear to present serious problems for such a scenario. Specifically, if amino acidsare readily produced by abiotic processes, then nucleotides are quite the reverse (asobering caveat to enthusiastic descriptions of the RNA world [127]). Any singlenucleotide comprises three distinct subcomponents: a base (a heterocyclic ring ofcarbon and nitrogen – that part of the nucleotide that varies and is used to carrygenetic information) is linked to a ribose (a cyclic five-membered sugar), whichis in turn linked to a phosphate. Each of these components is difficult to under-stand from the point of view of prebiotic chemistry. To name but a few of thesalient problems, not only are the reaction pathways by which the four bases can besynthesized inconsistent with one another, they are downright antagonistic [128].The most widely accepted abiotic pathway to produce ribose [129] also producesa host of other reaction products, including enantiomers of ribose in a racemicmixture [130] (and all sugars are unstable under what are generally consideredto be prebiotic conditions [131]). No plausible source for abiotic phosphate hasbeen found [132]. In fact, it is not only the components that present difficulties. Noone has yet produced a convincing, abiotically plausible reaction scheme by whichthe resulting nucleotide monomers could be assembled from these components[133] (not least because nucleotides themselves are highly unstable, and henceunlikely to have gradually accumulated from ineffective reaction pathways [134]).Moreover, no one has yet proposed how a pool of mixed organic monomers, includ-ing amino acids, nucleotides, and sugars, could fail to produce large quantities of"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"14 Could one predict earth’s biochemistry?305heteropolymers (i.e. hybrid chains built from nucleotides, amino acids, and otherreactive monomers) on a purely probabilistic basis [135].Of course, this is exactly the situation where the non-randomness of naturalselection might take over from the problems of abiotic improbability: if life gotunder way using a less complex genetic system [136], then it is easier to understandhow the “useful” properties of nucleotides could have been selected for [123, 124,126, 127]. In fact, there has been no shortage of suggestions as to possible forerun-ners of RNA. These include peptide–nucleic acid [137], triose nucleic acid [138],polyglyceric acid [139], and even inorganic crystals such as clay [140]. But sofarnoone has found a meaningful methodology to discriminate these suggestionsbeyond conjecture. Indeed, even the simple suggestion that perhaps the primitivegenetic system comprised fewer than four nucleotides has produced such varied andinconsistent ideas that the different hypotheses combine to undermine one another’scredibility (see [99] for references).Why is biochemistry dichotomous?Surrounding all of these issues, a subtly distinct and even more fundamental ques-tion remains largely untouched. All extant life employs a dichotomy of nucleic acidgenetic information and protein metabolism, with an associated suite of complexmolecular machinery for translating one into the other. It seems increasingly likelythat this situation evolved from an “RNA world” in which nucleic acid performedboth roles. Yet our explanation for why a unipolymeric biochemistry evolved intothe dichotomy of nucleic acid genetics and protein catalysis currently involves muchhand-waving. A typical answer is that the amino acid alphabet permitted greatercatalytic specificity than the nucleotide alphabet; for example, DNA could not haveevolved (as a more stable form of information storage) until protein catalysts wereperforming catalytic roles as sophisticated as free-radical biochemistry [141]. Butlet us rewind this statement a little. Suppose the earliest genetic code consisted offarfewer than 20 amino acids. As ribozymes are being shown to be capable of anunsuspected diversity and sophistication of catalytic properties, all indications arethat the nucleic acid alphabet could plausibly have expanded instead [142, 143,144, 145, 146]. It is unclear why proteins would enter such a situation.Szathm ́ary’s solution is that the nucleic acid alphabet was constrained in sizewithin an RNA world by the tradeoff demands of carrying information and per-forming catalysis [123]. A larger nucleic acid alphabet would have permitted moresophisticated metabolism, but would be more prone to copying errors. A smallernucleic acid alphabet would reverse this situation. In this case, the sort of trade-off that produced a nucleic acid alphabet of four letters would benefit from theevolution of a dedicated catalytic polymer. This would separate the two competingdemands for optimality. However, this cannot account in itself for the initial adaptive"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"306Stephen J. Freelandadvantage of coding unless it can be clearly shown that the amino acids of the orig-inal code opened new catalytic possibilities: evolution cannot plan ahead. In thiscontext, a very different idea comes from a recent turn in optimality studies of thestandard genetic code. So far, non-randomness in the standard code’s assignmentof codons to amino acids has been interpreted as a result of natural selection to min-imize the phenotypic impact (on protein function) of genetic errors [95]. Recentsimulations are now offering a challenge to this interpretation. It appears that the pre-cise properties of the standard genetic code (including its error-minimizing effects)actually speed the general process of adaptive evolution of all proteins [147]. Thetentative suggestion is that the standard genetic code might have evolved by cladesorting that would favor lineages best able to track changing environmental chal-lenges of the primordial biosphere. Although these findings are preliminary atpresent, the potential that coding itself arose as an adaptation for adapting seemstoo interesting to ignore.A speculative prediction for the future biochemistry of earth(or of visiting aliens)So far, I have built a cautious argument for the plausibility that, given primordialearth as a starting point, at least some important aspects of the biochemical basisfor life were predictable. From the beginning, I have argued that in our currentstate of scientific knowledge it is easier to explore evolutionary predictability intro-spectively (could an intelligent alien predict earth’s biochemistry?) than throughprojection onto the rest of the universe (could we predict the biochemistry of analien that was investigating us?). But having pushed this question to its (currentlymodest) limits in terms of our current science, I finish with a mix of observationand speculation about biochemistry such as we might encounter in our intelligentextraterrestrial observer.First, the observation. From the vantage point of the twenty-first century, it wouldappear that sentience on this planet is moving to incorporate an increasingly impor-tant component of disembodied information. The lore of oral culture has given wayto an accumulation of written learning, now merging into a global information tech-nology culture. As Dennett points out, unless we include some supernatural com-ponent in our account of how humanity arose, then everything that humans produce(from organisms that have been “artificially” selected or genetically engineered tocars and computers) may be considered an outcome of biological evolution, albeit akind of meta-evolutionary phenomenon [18]. Put another way, the only distinguish-ing difference between a molecule that is chemical and one that is biochemical is thatthe latter is somehow utilized by living system(s). Viewed in this way, it appearsthat the precise details of human information technology culture are becomingan increasingly important part of the biological information (biochemistry?) of"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"14 Could one predict earth’s biochemistry?307sentience on this planet. The “representational language” of information associatedwith this technology is binary (everything is represented as a string of 1s and 0s),whereas that of nucleic acid is based on a quarternary chemical alphabet (U, C, A,G). Certainly, an aperiodic, binary linear sequence is the simplest way in whichinformation can be represented. It might seem that a larger information-carryingalphabet could be advantageous in terms of transporting a denser information loadper unit message length, but the increased probability of transmission errors (orcost of increased error-checking processes) renders this unclear. Indeed, binaryrepresentation carries several fundamental advantages for storage, transmission,and manipulation of pure information. Thus, if Szathm ́ary’s explanation for thesize of the nucleic acid alphabet is correct, then we might interpret this spread ofthe new, binary “biochemistry” on earth as a further optimization rendered possi-ble once information is freed from the historical constraints of organic chemicalstructure that initiated it.Now, the speculation. Because mutation is a necessity for evolution, I wouldpredict that any extraterrestrial life will have evolved by using a form of geneticinformation prone to errors and decay. As such, the organic phase of alien sentiencewould be highly unsuitable for the long time periods and harsh conditions implicitin interplanetary space travel. However, I consider it likely that any sentient speciescapable of space exploration would also have discovered mechanical computation.Like us, such beings would have grown increasingly dependent on this syntheticprosthesis as their science and technology advanced. In other words, whereversentient life evolves, I think it likely that the spirit of space exploration will findthe flesh to be weak and will substitute manufactured technology to do such work.Iwould therefore consider it likely that if our species ever does interface withextraterrestrial intelligence, it will be by way of the manufactured technologicalproducts of an “organic” intelligent alien sentience (its meta-evolutionary products),whether or not the organic aliens themselves still exist. According to such a view,the most predictable feature of any alien that we encounter by dint of its travelingto find us would be its reliance on binary information storage. If so, then we andthe aliens would be demonstrating exactly the kind of convergence into optima thatConway Morris has suggested for independently evolving terrestrial lineages.Conclusion: from evolutionary inevitability to metaphysicsCould an intelligent alien predict earth’s fundamental biochemistry? We do notknow at present, but some surprisingly encouraging clues are starting to emerge.Aspects of the amino acid alphabet, the size and composition of the nucleic acidalphabet, and the form of the code that maps one to the other show signs that, withenough foreknowledge, these details of earth’s biochemistry might well be more orless predictable. Even the existence of the phenotype–genotype split that underpins"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"308Stephen J. Freelandmolecular biology may be an evolutionary “good move” that we would expect tooccur wherever life evolves. This hints at a new level to which our universe earnsthe description “biocentric.” Physics as we know it seems to extend meaningfullyinto the biology that it has produced. But the point of this chapter is not to give aclear, general answer one way or the other. It is to argue that further research seemsworthwhile. The questions are scientifically tractable (or at least tractable questionsexist that would further our understanding), and there is no reason to dismiss theexercise as contrary to reasonable expectations based on what we know of evolution.However, it would be remiss to finish without referring to one further factor thatcolors attitudes toward inquiries into the biocentric credentials of our universe. Theissue is that those who perceive a finely tuned aspect to our universe subsequentlydivide to offer one of two general explanations. Some argue that a biocentric uni-verse suggests the existence of a “designer” God. Others argue that the universeitself must be evolving or be part of a multiverse in which we unsurprisingly find our-selves in the corner best suited to producing us.4Either explanation pushes towardquestions that have no root in science, and some scientists appear uncomfortablewith producing data that stimulates theological or philosophical debate.Here, my concern was to delve into a straightforwardly scientific question:givenphysics,howcan we discern whether this universe was likely to produce life suchas what we know on earth? Yet points of philosophical and theological interestlie not far away. One review of Conway Morris book on anthropocentric evolu-tion, quoted on the back cover, concludes that it offers “a welcome antidote to thebleak nihilism of ultra-Darwinists.” The description of bleak nihilist hardly fitsDarwin himself, and many would be surprised to hear Gould’s long-term emphasison non-adaptive evolutionary luck described as ultra-Darwinian. Perhaps, then, thiscomment was directed at those evolutionary thinkers, such as Jacques Monod andRichard Dawkins, whose avowed atheism has led them repeatedly to cross from evo-lutionary theory into statements of a metaphysical nature. However, philosophershave been quick to point out the pitfalls of stretching one belief system to deny thevalidity of others in this context [149]. Nihilism remains the metaphysical belief ithas always been. Just as Kant’s “nebula hypothesis” [150] removed the need for aninterventionist creation of stars and planets, so modern evolutionary theory removes4Alhough proponents of this latter view sometimes portray themselves as liberating cosmology from a temporaryabduction by metaphysics, the rescue is not clear-cut. Gingerich has argued with eloquent simplicity that both amultiverse and a Creator are concepts that lie beyond our spacetime reality, such that both are equally inaccessibleto science and thus may be considered equally metaphysical. Put more bluntly, once mathematics has shown theplausible existence of alternative universes in which we do not live (because we couldn’t), how exactly are we totest this possibility? If their existence is unfalsifiable by experiment, then as an explanation for our finely tuneduniverse they remain a matter of faith. Indeed, one is tempted to perceive a direct link to Kant’s philosophicaldistinction between noumenal and phenomenal concepts: with only one reality at our disposal, howcouldwebring the existence of multiple alternative realities within the scope of experimental science? Perhaps this willturn out to be a further “God-of-the-gaps” fallacy (for example, see [148]), but this particular debate is forphysicists, philosophers, and theologians (with several direct contributions in this volume)."},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"14 Could one predict earth’s biochemistry?309the need to invoke a Cosmic Watchmaker as explanation for the biosphere that weencounter. But, as Kant and many others have pointed out, removing the necessityfor an interventionist creator hardly disproves the existence of God. Likewise, Dar-winism (ultra- or otherwise) is currently linked to metaphysical opinion only bythe faith of its proponents, and some of its most vociferous proponents have placedtheir faith in atheism. This is not to imply that the equally simplistic conclusion ofde factomutual independence for faith and science [151]isanymore defensible,butIhappily relinquish further discussion of this territory to those whose thinkingbegins here [152]. My point is simply that ultra-Darwinism, if this phrase is taken tomean methodical application of neo-Darwinist theory, by way of optimality theory,is well suited to objective investigations of the significance of earth’s biochemistry.Proper metaphysical interpretation lies beyond science, as the task of scholars withappropriate expertise in such matters.Dawkins accurately describes natural selection’s “utility function” in modernbiology as the preservation of genes. Yet nothing in this description confirms ordenies whether selection played a role in shaping life’s biochemical foundation,with consequences that profoundly influenced the ultimate outcome of evolution.It is simply unscientific to regard a lack of evidence as the final word. I thereforeadvocate neo-Darwinian optimality investigations as appropriate lines of inquiryfor evolutionary biologists to study biochemical fine-tuning. These will includeinvestigations into the significance of the size and composition of the nucleic acidand amino acid alphabets, the “choice” of nucleic acid and protein biopolymers,the organization of the standard genetic code, and the evolution of a dichotomyof nucleic acid genotype and protein phenotype. If evolutionary biologists dismisssuch scientific inquiry on the grounds of metaphysical distaste, then they followin the footsteps of creationists who ignore related areas of scientific inquiry foressentially the same reason.References[1]Oxford English Dictionary, online edn. 2E: http://dictionary.oed.com/.[2]L.

Bioenergeticconstraints, allometric trends, and the evolutionof life-history invariantsJeffrey P. SchlossIf there is ever a time in which we must make profession of two oppositetruths, it is when we are reproached for omitting one.–Pascal,Pens ́ees1IntroductionAfamous metaphor in integrative biology refers to the relationship between envi-ronmental constraint and evolutionary change as “the ecological theater and theevolutionary play” (Hutchinson,1965). In the forty years since the penning of thatphrase, the relationship between play and stage has been a matter of vigorous andfascinating debate. The issues have profound implications, not only for our scien-tific account of the evolutionary process, but also for our expectation of what lifemight look like on other planets and, indeed, for our philosophical and theologicalunderstandings of what it might mean on this one.The controversy involves differing conclusions about the roles of contingencyand constraint in evolutionary history, including, among other things, the way inwhich fundamental regularities of the physico-chemical environment, or “stage,”influence the unfolding of the evolutionary drama. On the one hand, many prevalentexpositions of the evolutionary play suggest that the fundamental or ultimate actorsare genes, not organismic (much less mental) agents (Dawkins,1976, 1998; Dennett,1995). The drama itself is a theater of the absurd, a plotless improvisation usingwhatever props are contingently provided by the environment (Gould,1989, 1996).Contingency is held to exert determinative influence on history, and, according toStephen Gould’s widely cited metaphor, “we would probably never arise again evenif life’s tape could be replayed a thousand times” (1989,p.234).

Or none.On the other hand, some accounts of evolutionary change emphasize a scien-tifically explicable thematic continuity and even a plausible, perhaps inevitable,directionality (Carroll,2001; Conway Morris,1998, 2003;deDuve,2002; Denton,1998; Salthe,1993; Szathm ́ary and Maynard Smith,1995;Williams and Fra ́usto daSilva,2003;but see Szathm ́ary,2002). Like a good melodrama, revisit the theaterand one will see variations on a recurrent theme.There are two classes of explanation for this, both of which emphasize evolution-ary constraint. One approach to this issue focuses on the preconditional fitness oftheabioticenvironment – the cosmos, earth, and/or physico-chemical variables –for life. Structural design of the theater predictably constrains the plot of the play,as environmental ordering trumps or at least mitigates contingent influences onevolution. This could occur through intrinsic, prebiotic properties of the stage.Or it could occur interactively though modification of the environment by organ-ismic agents, which directionally transform stage construction by their chemicalmetabolism (Williams and Fra ́usto da Silva,2003). Another approach involves fun-damentalbioticconstraints, emerging, of course, from underlying chemistry. Theseconstraints operate at the internal level of bioenergetic (Westet al., 1999a, 2004)or developmental (Maynard Smithet al., 1985) limits, or at the interactive level ofselectionally optimized or invariant strategies for allocating resources across lifehistory (Kozlowski and Weiner,1997).Of course, metaphor may help frame (or serve to obscure!) a question, but it willnot answer it. In this chapter I hope to clarify the contingency/constraint debate andits relationship to environmental fitness and directionality by focusing on severalconceptually related examples of convergent functional trends in physiological andevolutionary ecology. Although all cases of convergence or directionality entailquestions of physico-chemical constraint, the effects may be manifest at variouslevels of biotic organization, including the molecular mechanisms of replication andmetabolism, structures of cellular integration, multicellular functional complexity,and even intelligence. In fact, Williams and Fra ́usto da Silva (2003,p.323) recognizethis organizational hierarchy itself as an “inevitable progression” driven by thesequential oxidation of the environment through living cells’ reductive organicchemistry.Various contributions to this volume address each of these levels. I wish toemphasize the “upper” end of the continuum by focusing not on the traditionalapex of intelligence, but on the evolved capacity for interorganismal investment or“inter-subjective commitment” (Nesse,2001). I will argue that, within bioenergeticconstraints of metabolism and selective constraints of fitness tradeoffs in energybudgets, evolution has predictably, perhaps inevitably (although not eliminatively)"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"320JeffreyP.Schlossconverged on life history strategies with particular relational significance. Thesestrategies involve the capacity to recognize other individuals and make significant,protracted investments in their welfare. In life history theory, this has culminatedin what has somewhat euphemistically, although not altogether facetiously, beencalled the transfer of benefits or “live to give” hypothesis (Lee,2003;Wade,2003).Vigorous controversies notwithstanding, I must begin by acknowledging that theroles of constraint and contingency in evolutionary processes are, of course, notmutually exclusive. In fact they are mutually necessary (Carroll,2001). Neverthe-less, a significant amount of both the scientific and interdisciplinary literature onthese issues has been characterized by an unnecessary dichotomization of causalexplanations and a regrettable polarization of rhetoric. There are two reasons forthis, both of which I hope at least to avoid, if not to redress.First, these questions have obvious entanglements with ideological and meta-physical issues. On the one hand, philosophical precommitments influence theplausibility criteria by which theories are assessed. On the other hand, scientificconclusions have implications for the justification of theological and moral belief.Wewill clearly see these dynamics at work in the controversies that follow.Understandably, extreme assertions have begotten extreme responses. The clich ́eexhortation here would be to disentangle the science from metaphysics; but giventhe nature of the issues, it is not clear that this is entirely possible, or even desirable.A more modest and potentially more constructive response would be to explore theissues in light of an explicit and nuanced recognition of the logical entailments. AsI will argue below, and contrary to prominent assertions (Gould,1989, 1996; Ruse,1996, 2003), the dichotomized scientific accounts are not diametrically opposed intheir theological implications. Either can be, and each has been, employed on behalfof both theologically hostile and hospitable arguments. This does not mean theissues are irrelevant, and in fact I will argue that the very ambiguity is theologicallysignificant.Second, and more specifically, two logically separate but related scientific aspectsof these questions have frequently been intertwined, if not conflated. However, theyhave quite different evolutionary foci and interdisciplinary ramifications. Theseinvolve questions of what might be considered thenecessaryversussufficientcon-ditions for the evolution of life. The first question involves the issue of which featuresof the abiotic environment are requisite to the origin and manifest diversificationof life. This has been the traditional domain of “fine-tuning” arguments. A lessmetaphysically laden and more historically consistent way to speak of it would bein terms of “the fitness of the environment,” as emphasized nearly a century ago byLawrence J. Henderson (1913). Darwinian theory typically addresses the fitness oforganisms to the environment. A complementary question – which at face value isapriorito the question of natural selection – is the fitness of the environment to life, orthe preconditional requirements of the “theater,” to support an evolutionary drama."},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"15 Would Venus evolve on Mars?321This question may be asked at the level of the physical constants of the cosmos,the life-sustaining features of our planet, or the unique aspects of chemistry thatare fundamental to life. If, on empirical grounds, those preconditions appear to behighly specific or biophilically constant, it raises the teleological question of theenvironment’s fitness not justtolife, butforlife.2Furthermore, if – on non-empiricalbut some would argue rationally justifiable grounds – the specificity seems to behighly unlikely (a complicated and perhaps intractable question; see Barrow,2002;Manson,2000), it raises the metaphysical question of fine-tuning or divine design.It is possible to affirm the former without affirming the latter (Henderson,1913;Denton,1998).In contrast to the question of necessity, which entails the characteristics of theenvironment (E), required for life (L) to evolve, given what we know of life (L→E),the question of sufficiency entails the characteristics of life that must have cometo pass, given what we know of the environment (E→L). This involves preciselythe question of inevitability in playing the tape over and getting the same results.However the environment came about, and however finely tuned its properties areor are not, does the environment that exists so constrain biochemistry that the ori-gin of life and the direction of its evolution were highly probable, if not certain?Is evolutionary “‘unfolding’ in any way predictablebeforethe fact of history?”(Freeland, Chapter 14, this volume). The idea that the world is so constructed asto guide the historical unfolding of life in a way that is open to, if not suggestiveof, developmental or teleological interpretation has attracted vigorous theologicalinterest. However, although these issues are theologically significant, there is notheistically “right” answer here. One can answer this fascinating question affirma-tively, without advocating theistic precommitments or conclusions (de Duve,2002;Denton,1998; Wright,2000), or negatively, while accepting them (Behe,1996;Beheet al., 2000; Dembski,2001, 2002).The two different issues of sufficiency and necessity – if, and only if – are alludedto in the subtitle of Simon Conway Morris’s (2003) book,Life’s Solution: InevitableHumans in a Lonely Universe, and involve, respectively, determinative and requi-site constraints in evolution. This chapter will focus on the question of sufficientor determinative constraint. The question of whether the environment is suited orfit to ensure the arising of complex, socially affiliative life is both scientificallyand theologically significant. I will argue that directional and convergent trendsin the evolution of life history strategies reflect an inherent tilt toward increased2Lest the “to” versus “for” distinction seem obscure, let me illustrate by pointing to the differing implicationsof saying the heart is fittopump blood and the heart isforpumping blood. Or a Stradivarius may be fittoburn but is notforkindling. Although teleology in terms of Final Causes has been extruded quite legitimatelyand fruitfully from science, there is significant debate about whether teleological explanations remain helpful,perhaps essential, in organismic or evolutionary biology (Fodor,1998; Bekoff and Allen,1998). Hendersonposited such a teleology without supernatural metaphysical entailments."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"322JeffreyP.Schlossinterorganismal investment. In so doing, I will make some general comments aboutinferences of directional trends and constraint, survey three major and interactingdomains of evolutionary trend, assess current debates over their possible relation-ship to intrinsic constraints, and conclude with some theological comments onhow these scientific issues relate to questions of cosmic purpose, or “plot” in theevolutionary play.Of trends andtelosThe issue of evolutionary directionality as it reflects finely tuned constraints involvesthree levels of disagreement.Trends or no trends?The first issue is whether there evenaremeaningful evolutionary trends suggestiveof constrained directionality rather than contingent variability. Of course, evolu-tionary history exhibits directional change: we have life now and did not have it fourbillion years ago. And since the origin of life, organisms have become, among otherthings, larger, multicellularly complex, taxonomically diverse, and energeticallyintensive (Bonner,1988; Maynard Smith and Szathm ́ary,1995; McShea,2001b;McShea and Changizi,2003; Szathm ́ary and Maynard Smith,1995;Williams andFra ́usto da Silva,2003). The question here is whether this represents the merelycontingent directionality of a few “major evolutionary transitions” (Janis,1993)precipitated by unpredictable geo- or climatological cataclysms or whether direc-tional change representative of consistent evolutionary trends, involves, in Eldredgeand Gould’s terms, “biostratigraphic character gradients” (1988,p.211)? If so, andmost important, does this reflect the fact that “life was in a physical chemical tunneland there was only one way to go” (Williams and Fra ́usto da Silva,2003,p.335)?Although I will assess evidence for the latter, the question has been complicatedby theological entanglements. The twin issues of evolutionary progress and direc-tional inevitability have been invested with substantial significance in the wake ofnatural theology’s displacement by Darwinian naturalism. Once organismicprod-uctscould no longer be construed as evidence of intervention by a designing deity,the evolutionaryprocesswasargued to represent the historical drama of a divineplaywright (Ruse,1996). Thus, debates over progress and inevitability are fre-quently represented as disputes between theism-friendly and theism-hostile ver-sions of evolution (Gould,1989, 1996, 2002; Ruse,1996, 2005). But this is notnecessarily the case on either count. With respect to progress, although there hasbeen a flourishing of evolutionary eschatologies since Teilhard de Chardin (Schloss,2002), no intrinsic theological warrant exists for believing that historical change"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"15 Would Venus evolve on Mars?323must naturally incline toward improvement. In fact, some thoughtful traditionsreject a ruddy optimism gleaned from extrapolation of progressive trends in favorof theological hope for redemption of a fundamentally ambiguous creation (Barth,2000; Kierkegaard,1995;Pascal,1958). Perhaps it is even tilted toward chaos, or atleast vulnerable to demise (Polkinghorne and Welker,2000; Russell,2002; Schloss,2002;Watts,2000). With respect to inevitability, it has almost become a shibbo-leth to say that contingency is irreconcilable with providence. In his seminal andoft-quotedThe Meaning of Evolution, George Gaylord Simpson maintained that “apurposeless and materialistic process that did not have man in mind...[means]he was not planned” (Simpson,1967,p.344). Similarly, Stephen Gould concludesthat seeing another drama on replaying the tapes is incommensurate with notionsof Providence (Gould,1996). But this is uncritically to infer metaphysical fromhistorical contingency. It also conflates the lack of intentionality in a mechanisticcause (or process) with the lack of a final cause or divine purpose. Ironically, theseare precisely the errors that are justifiably criticized in creationists’ rejection ofevolution.Moreover, if contingency is not necessarily the foe of providence, inevitabilityis surely not the friend (Gingerich,2005). With the rise of seventeenth centurymechanism, this very issue was the focus of debate between Descartes and Gassendi,whose views were rooted in the even more ancient differences of Thomists andnominalists (Osler,1994). Indeed, with no contingency at all, there is no roomfor final cause or purposeful agency. Einstein’s aphorism reflects longstandingtheological questions of causal necessity: “I want to know whether God had anychoice in creating the universe.” These same issues are still unresolved betweentwo very different (and equivalently over-simplistic) contemporary approaches tonatural theology. One argues that the inevitability of life’s origin and evolutionaryhistory is testimony of divine purpose, and another infers divine design preciselyfrom the wildly contingent improbability of obtaining what we have (Behe,1996;Dembski,1998, 2001; Ross,2001). My point is that the contingency/constraintdebate is not a dispute between science and religion, but is a fundamental issue ofambiguity existing within both theological and scientific interpretations of nature.Biased vs. driven trendsEven if one tentatively grants the existence of significant and constrained evolu-tionary trends (Bonner,1988; Gould,1988a,b; Knoll and Bambach,2000; MaynardSmith,1970; McShea,1998, 2001a; McShea and Changizi,2003; Stanley,1973;Szathm ́ary and Maynard Smith,1995;Wagner,1996), differing understandingsremain about (a) the nature of this directionality and (b) the factors that constrain it.One involves debate over whether the trends involve passive or driven evolutionary"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"324JeffreyP.Schlosschange (McShea,1994, 1998;Wang,2001), the other over whether factors con-straining major trends are primarily internal or external (Carroll,2001).Driven change would involve biased replacement or movement away fromone pole and toward another pole of a character gradient, mediated by consis-tent selective advantages and/or fundamental biomechanical–developmental con-straints. Conversely, a passive trend would involve no evolutionary bias at all, butrather random diffusion away from a minimum functional threshold of size, com-plexity, or other quality (Bonner,1988; Gould,1988b; Knoll and Bambach,2000;McShea,1994, 1998; Stanley,1973). In fact, in the absence of such a minimum,there would be no directional trend at all, but simply an adirectional increase inphenotypic variance (Gould,1988b).As above, this debate has involved both ideological and theological issues. Ide-ological implications include the concern that claims of a strong evolutionary or“natural” bias toward particular biological characteristics have been used to justify,and have also often reflected, an ideologically based social vision (Gould,1981,1988a; Ruse,1996). This is regrettably true in historic cases such as Social Darwin-ism, eugenics, Marxist genetics, and some theories of gender and social stratifica-tion (Gould,1981; Kaye,1986; Larson,1995;Lewontinet al., 1984; Sahlins,1976;Sayers,1982). For this reason, Stephen Gould has been a strong proponent bothof largely contingent evolutionary history and, in clear cases of constrained trends,of passive rather than driven change. His powerful metaphor for this is a drunk’srandom stumbling down a street with a wall on one side. This strong rejection ofprogress or any kind of directional bias in evolution contrasts with his earlier views,congenial to the argument presented here, that posited a life history trend towardhigher and more selective investment in other organisms (Gould,1977). His posi-tion appears to have emerged while writing his 1981 treatise on biological racism,The Mismeasure of Man(Ruse,1996).It is indeed important to avoid using a theory of how things are as a justificationfor how things should be – the naturalistic fallacy (Moore,1903). But it is equallyimportant not to reject an idea on the basis of its implications if misused – theconsequentialist fallacy. In fact, there is a long (though controversial) history, fromThomas Huxley (1894)toRichard Dawkins (1976) and George Williams (1993), ofrecognizing the morally ambiguous, even objectionable, nature of the evolutionaryprocess and many of its products. Far from rejecting the underlying science on thisbasis, these writers have argued that it can be used to inform and exhort a humanmorality founded on selectively resisting, rather than uncritically endorsing, allaspects of nature.Theologically, the image of a drunk stumbling down the road is certainly provoca-tive, and the metaphor of passive diffusion rather than driven change is less conno-tive of evolutionarytelosor inevitability. Connotations notwithstanding, I should"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"15 Would Venus evolve on Mars?325point out that although differences between passive and driven trends have impor-tant implications for understanding the specific causes of directional change in theevolution of various characters, each view harbors completely equivalent implica-tions for the issue of inevitability. A diffusional process is entirely non-contingent,and although I will argue that the following trends reflect strong biases, they wouldbe no less certain if they entailed passive, diffusional increases in maxima. “Pas-sive trends towards increases in organismal size, complexity, and diversity fromsome initial minima are certain to prevail in any system” (Carroll,2001,p.1108).Moreover, the metaphor of diffusion (and metaphor it is) functions merely as adescription of pattern, but not an explanation of cause (McShea,1994). Even iftrends are passive, we still need to examine the reasons for constrained minima andinevitable movement away from this boundary (McShea,1998).Internal vs. external constraintsThere is increasing discussion of whether major evolutionary trends, particularlypatterns in life history evolution, reflect constraints that are primarily internal orexternal in nature. “Internal” constraints are taken to be inherent in the physico-chemical, metabolic, or developmental limits of the organism and in some casesare posited to entail universal first principles underlying all organisms. “External”constraints are understood in terms of what will reproductively flourish or “work”in any given environment. They involve selectional tradeoffs between solutionsto a variety of challenges imposed by different abiotic and biotic environmentalfactors. Many of these factors, such as dispersals of predators and competitors, orgeological and climatological cataclysms, may be contingent.Like the above two controversies, discussions of this issue have become some-what intellectually dichotomized and rhetorically polarized.3Although advocatesof the positions seem to represent differences not so much in ideological as indisciplinary commitments, the arguments reflect profoundly contrasting ways ofunderstanding the history and, indeed, perhaps the nature of life. On the onehand, the impressive and rapidly growing literature on internal constraint, involv-ing significant contributions by physicists and chemists, strongly maintains thatphysico-chemical principles are sufficient to determine major evolutionary patterns.They entail provocative proposals for a universal or master equation of metabolism(Gilloolyet al., 2001;Savageet al., 2004)oranoxidatively driven “inevitable pro-gression” from prokaryotes through metazoan nervous systems to human beings(Williams and Fra ́usto da Silva,2003). On the other hand, the notion of external3Foranexcellent representation of the arguments in one recent and particularly fascinating instantiation ofthis debate, see the theme issue ofFunctional Ecology(182, 2004) dedicated to internalist and externalistunderstandings of allometric trends in metabolic rate."},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"326JeffreyP.Schlossconstraints, emphasized by many comparative physiologists and evolutionary ecol-ogists, acknowledges far less clarity and inevitability in evolutionary history. Itviews directional patterns as being underdetermined by physical necessity andreflecting the stochastic outcomes negotiated by natural selection (Bokma,2004;Charnov,1993; Hochachka and Somero,2002;Kozlowski and Konarzewski,2004;Kozlowski and Weiner,1997; Stearns,1992).This issue is significant for two reasons. First, providing an account for any set ofgeneralized patterns that goes beyond statistical description to causal explanationin terms of first principles would represent a revolutionary contribution to thebiological sciences. This is especially true for ecology and evolutionary biology,which have been markedly recalcitrant to such approaches (Whitfield,2001). Thisquestion is germane to the themes of this volume, because it is central to the conceptof biochemical fine-tuning or the Hendersonian notion of environmental fitness: itis physico-chemical first principles that would constitute sufficient constraints, i.e.the suitability of the prebiotic cosmos to predictably generate the kind of life weobserve.Second, because internal constraint would presumably influence evolutionaryunfolding in a way less vulnerable to contingent variation than selection-mediatedtradeoffs in solutions to independent environmental challenges (Clarke,2004;Clarke and Fraser,2004;West and Brown,2004;Westet al., 2004), it has implica-tions for the theologically charged question of inevitable evolutionary directionalityor divinetelos. That is undoubtedly one reason for the interdisciplinary nature of thisvolume. However, I have already argued that inevitability is theologically ambigu-ous. In what follows, I will also argue that the vigorous and fascinating debate overinternal and external constraint – prominent in each of the following issues – entailsbut does not reduce to necessitarian versus contingent views of evolutionary history.Bioenergetic trendsTwoofthe most significant trends in evolutionary history – and perhaps two ofthe most notable generalizations in all the biological sciences – entail evolutionaryincreases in body size (Cope’s Rule) and energetic intensiveness across and withinthe major taxa. Although the former relates to the latter in several ways, I want todiscuss two manifestations of energetic trends across evolutionary history that havesignificant implications for life history strategy. First, energy flow through biotaand individual organisms has generally escalated. Biomass density, gross primaryproductivity, production efficiency, and secondary productivity have all increased.More significantly, energy utilization per organism has increased with increasingbody mass, and mass-specific metabolic rate has increased from unicellular organ-isms, through ectothermic metazoans, to endothermic metazoans."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"15 Would Venus evolve on Mars?327These trends represent a fascinating and well established instance of neces-sary conditions having been progressively generated by the action of life itselfupon the environment (see, for example, Williams and Fra ́usto da Silva,2003).Life-generated prerequisites to these trends include increases in atmospheric freeoxygen, biomass density, and biomineralization over evolutionary time. But whatdrives utilization of these substrates in the direction of increased energetic intensity?Approaches to this involve internal and external constraints. Vermeij proposes aco-evolutionary arms race, in which defensive armaments and attendant counter-measures result in a continuing “evolutionary escalation” (1987, 1994). Selectionfavors energetically intensive adaptations such as locomotor performance, toxicity,armor, high growth rates, and metabolically demanding increases in informationgathering and processing. This involves intrinsic directionality, perhaps spiked byepisodic and contingent environmental increases in nutrient availability (Vermeij,1987). Alternatively, Stanley Salthe (1993) has an elegant proposal for an intrin-sic increase of energy utilization in developing systems, followed by a decreaseduring senescence. These developmental changes occur with concomitant changesin information and organizational complexity and apply to developmental pro-cesses at organismal, ecological, and evolutionary scales (Salthe,1993). The aboveapproaches and others involving external and internal constraints need not be mutu-ally exclusive, and may even be nested. Importantly, all posit intrinsic and sufficientconditions for evolutionary increase in energetic intensiveness.The second and more specific bioenergetic trend involves thermoregulation.Beyond the fact that its very emergence represents a historic vector (primitiveorganisms are thermal conformers), there are two fascinating and sometimes con-flated aspects of a trend toward thermoregulatory escalation. First is the increasein body temperature, or differentials between organismal and ambient tempera-ture (Hamilton,1973). This consistent progression is evident along an extensivephyletic continuum that includes invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, monotremes,marsupials, eutherian mammals, passerines, and non-passerine birds. It is a dra-matic example of a consistent directional trend across major taxa, but even withintaxa it is tempting to describe temperature relations as reflecting a drive towardmaximization or “maxithermy” (Hamilton,1973). The preferred temperatures andthermal performance curves of most organisms are not normal but skewed left, withtemperature optima that approach the highest sustainable in a given environment(Hamilton,1973) and that are often quite close to upper-critical and even lethaltemperatures (Huey and Bennett,1987).Why is this the case? Numerous studies provide evidence for the selective advan-tage of increased body temperature for food capture, prey avoidance, assimilationefficiency, and growth rates (Avery,1984;Averyet al., 1982; Christian and Tracy,1981; Greenwald,1974). Locomotor performance in a wide variety of species is"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"328JeffreyP.Schlossoptimized at temperatures higher than ambient, and compensation for the depress-ing effects of decreased temperature does not appear to be effective: “in regards tolocomotion, warmer appears to be better” (Bennett,1987,p.422). This appears toentail a driven directional and convergent trend across major evolutionary transi-tions, that involves the direct physico-chemical effects of temperature.A question that is related to but separate from the issue of temperature increaseis that of convergence: why does body temperature in independent endothermsapproximate 36–38◦C? Paul (1986)argued that the body temperatures of mostendotherms approximate the 36◦C temperature at which the specific heat of wateris lowest, and hence the temperature at which the least heat would be lost to theenvironment. However, the problem with this proposal is that the actual rate of heatloss, and hence the behavioral or metabolic costs of heat replacement, is entirelyindependent of specific heat. Thermal flux is determined by the driving force or thetemperature differential between organism and environment, and elevating the tem-perature of endotherms to 36◦C actually results in greater heat loss. An alternativephysico-chemical proposal, based on this observation, is that raising the organism–environment temperature differential, and hence the driving force, facilitates the dis-sipation of excess metabolic heat in birds and mammals, by conduction, convection,and radiation, rather than by costly evaporative loss of water (Calder,1986). A com-plementary proposal posits the optimization of water’s viscosity, which decreaseswith temperature, and the solubility of hydrophobic molecules, which increaseswith temperature. The intersection of these curves occurs at approximately 36◦C(Duntee and Benner,1986).The significant bottom line is that fundamental physical and chemical propertiesof the abiotic environment appear related to both an increase and a convergence ofbody temperatures. But how do organisms maintain these temperatures? The sec-ond aspect of thermoregulatory trends involves escalation, not of the set-point, butof the modes of temperature regulation, which have become increasingly metabol-ically and behaviorally costly. One aspect of this involves the maintenance of bodytemperature by internal (metabolic) rather than external means, the progressiveemployment of endo- versus ectothermy, which convergently arises across verte-brate, invertebrate, and even plant taxa. Another aspect involves increasing precisionof temperature regulation, the transition from poikilo- to homeothermy, entailinghigher peak performance and narrower thermal performance breadth. These strate-gies represent not dichotomies but continua, which have increased and been coupledoverevolutionary history.44Although some primitive organisms inhabiting thermally stable environments have been referred to as nominalhomeotherms, this is a misnomer as such organisms are not thermal regulators at all, much less precise ones.Some dinosaurs may have been inertial homeotherms, relying on their large thermal mass (McNab,2002)."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"15 Would Venus evolve on Mars?329Three classic explanations for the evolution of endothermic homeothermy allentail bioenergetic constraint: increased stability of body temperature enablingrefinement of optimal performance, increased spatial and temporal independence ofbody temperature enabling expanded domains of activity, and increased metabolicscope enabling higher and more sustained peak performance (McNab,2002).Because these advantages obviously entail tradeoffs between costs and benefits,the directional trend they are proposed to explain is not eliminative : although thereis an increase in maximal thermoregulatory investment, there are still plenty ofectotherms and thermal conformers. Crucial to our focus, though, the trend is verystrongly driven to converge with other life history traits, particularly parental care.The higher energetic requirements of this thermal strategy demand substantiallygreater parental input into young, especially because the surface area : volume ratioof juveniles involves high heat loss. Thus, while natural selection has produced andsustained a variety of thermoregulatory strategies, there have been a directionalincrease and convergent arising of maxithermy, endothermy, and homeothermy– which are associated with one another and have driven concomitant increasesin parental care.5If this account is correct, thermodynamics entails parentalinvestment.Three fundamental affirmations are relevant at this point. First, there are cleardirectional and convergent trends of increase in energetic and thermoregulatoryintensity within and across lineages. These trends appear to have both passiveand driven components, but in both cases increased maxima reflect evolutionaryinevitabilities. Second, debated explanations of these trends employ internal andexternal constraints, but little theoretical or empirical warrant exists for consideringthem mutually exclusive, nor is there any credible account that is wholly contingent.Third, both energetic and size increases harbor significant implications – separatelyand in their interaction – for parental care and, as we shall see, other major lifehistory trends.Allometry: of mice and menAlthough trends in body size and energy utilization are significant in themselves, thescaling relationship between mass and metabolism represents a crucial, some argueuniversal (Savageet al., 2004;West and Brown,2004), convergent evolutionarypattern. Not only is it one of the most fundamental and widely discussed regularities5Arecent revisionist theory has suggested that instead of the selective advantages of endothermy driving theevolution of parental care, the reverse was the case. High parental attentiveness drove the evolution of endothermyby the requirements of a stable temperature during development and sustained performance levels for postnatalparental provisioning (Farmer,2000;Watanabe,2005). These approaches may not be mutually exclusive, as it ispossible to have autocatalytic effects. But while the fascinating question of the evolution of endothermy remainsunresolved, the undisputed and for our purposes crucial point is the tight linkage with parental care."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"330JeffreyP.Schlossin the biological sciences, but also it relates – empirically if not causally – to theimportant life history characteristics under discussion here.Bergmann (1847) first noted that metabolic rate in mammals appeared to scalewith mass to a 2/3power. Rubner (1883) observed that heat production appearedto be more closely correlated with surface area than with mass, positing the widelycited Rubner’s rule or “surface law.” Huxley (1932) advocated fitting metabolic rateto a power function of mass, and based on the most extensive empirical analysis todate, Kleiber (1932) concluded that the exponent was 3/4. By mid-century we hadthe “3/4 rule.” Surface area explanations of metabolic scaling were abandoned.For one thing, they required a 2/3exponent (representing the linear dimensionsquared) that did not fit the data. In addition, metabolic rate scaled to body massby a similar power function in ectotherms, for which the metabolic replacement ofsurface-mediated heat loss was not relevant.In spite of the general acceptance of the 3/4 rule, which has become a promi-nent “textbook example” of scaling, discussion has continued about whether thisvalue for the exponent is reliable. The debate has been renewed over whether theexponent is 2/3 (Heusner,1982a,b)or3/4 (MacMahon,1973, 1975; Feldmanand MacMahon,1983). There has also been concern about whether the interspe-cific slope reflects experimental or statistical artifact (Elgar and Harvey,1987;Heusner,1991; McNab,1986, 1988). An adequate mathematical understandingof these relations has been described as “the central question in comparativephysiology” (Heusner,1991,p.34). Indeed, until recently we have lacked notonly a consensus description of how metabolism and mass scale, but also, andmore importantly, a coherent mechanistic proposal for why they do so (Bennett,1988).That has changed dramatically over the past several years, with the ground-breaking work of West and co-workers (Westet al., 1997, 1999a,b, 2003;Westand Brown,2004; see also Brownet al., 1993; Enquistet al., 1998, 1999;Savageet al., 2004). In two seminal papers, Westet al.(1997, 1999a) accept that the 3/4law is empirically warranted, and assume that natural selection maximizes resourceexchange and minimizes time and energy for resource transport. They develop amodel that describes resource transport through a branched, fractal-like networkof circulatory tubes (1997) or, more generally, a space-filling distributional surfacearea (1999a), corresponding to every level of biotic exchange from digestive cav-ities or plant leaves to transport vessels to cell surfaces, mitochondria, and evenmolecules. Unlike external surface area, which scales through the square of thelinear dimension, an internal, space-filling surface area scales as the cube. Energyutilization will scale as a function ofD/(D+ 1), whereD= the number of dimen-sions. The adaptations to provisioning an internal, “three-dimensional” surface areaeffectively endow living systems with an additional, “fourth” dimension."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"15 Would Venus evolve on Mars?331The authors conclude that these geometric and physical constraints so limit thepossibility space on which selection can act, that all organisms reflect quarter-powerscaling laws – 3/4 for metabolic rate, 1/4 for internal time and distance – that areas universal as biochemical pathways or the genetic code. However, unlike the lasttwo cases, which may reflect the retention of an underdetermined initial characterthat arose but once, adaptations that effectively contribute a fourth dimension –lungs, gills, guts, kidneys, organelles, as well as branching whole-organism mor-phologies – have convergently arisen at numerous times in evolutionary history.This proposal both points out and explains the convergent scaling of numerousphysiological adaptations, and it also has been extended in an impressively ambi-tious and promising attempt to explain a wide range of previously disparate relationsin population and community ecology. This includes: proposals for universal tem-perature dependence of life; scaling relations in plant morphology, productivity, andlife history; energy flux, carbon turnover, and biomass density in plant populations;a general allometric model for growth and development; energy flux in ecosystemsand across food webs; rates of mutation and carcinogenesis; and patterns in globalbiodiversity (Allenet al., 2002; Brown and Gillooly,2003; Enquist,2002; Enquistet al., 1998, 1999, 2003; Gilloolyet al., 2001, 2002; Niklas and Enquist,2001;Westet al., 1999b, 2001, 2004). It is the first attempt to provide an account of a widearray of biological and ecological generalizations on the basis of first principles.The formulation of inherent biophysical constrains represents an emphatic alt-ernative to radical contingency: “Does some fixed point or deep basin of attractionin the dynamics of natural selection ensure that all life is organized by a fewfundamental principles and that energy is a prime determinant of biological structureand dynamics among all possible variables?” (West and Brown,2004,p.42). Theproposal for fundamental internal constraints is one of the most broadly unifyingand mechanistically based explanations advanced in evolutionary ecology. It hasbeen widely lauded – “if it holds up, it’s going to rewrite our evolutionary biology”(Klarreich,2005)–and also severely criticized.The disagreement falls into three main classes. First, some researchers still dis-pute the 3/4 characterization of metabolic scaling (Bokma,2004; Doddset al.,2001; White and Seymour,2003). However, in an analysis of what is arguably themost extensive and rigorously selected data set to date, the West team confirmed 3/4scaling across mammals and a variety of other taxa (Savageet al., 2004). Moreover,they point out that deviations from 3/4 scaling, found in smaller mammals by otherstudies, are actually predicted by their initial model on the basis of dominance ofPoiseuille rather than pulsatile flow in smaller-diameter, originating vessels.Second, some workers affirm the 3/4 rule and posit an explanation for it thatinvolves intrinsic constraints, but disagree with West and co-workers’ proposal.Banavaret al.(1999, 2002) advocate an account that is amenable to but more general"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"332JeffreyP.Schlossthan West’s, rejecting the notion of an effective fourth dimension to life. Instead,allometric scaling is intrinsic to all systems with directed flow and circulationtimes that are proportional to length but not size. However, a problem with thisis that it does not provide a conciliatory explanation for all the other organismalcharacteristics that scale allometrically.Darveauet al.(2002, 2003) propose that the relationship between body massand metabolic rate reflects the contribution of multiple factors – ATP-utilizationprocesses in parallel, supply processes in series – that each have different powerfunctions. This hierarchical layering results in an “allometric cascade” that hasdifferent scaling implications for different measures of metabolism. They contendthat only a multiple-factor account, and not West’s (or any) single-cause account, canexplain the scaling difference between basal and maximum metabolic rate (Bishop,1999). However, the mathematical formulation of their model has been severelycriticized (Banavaret al., 2003;Westet al., 2003), and in any case it does not providean account of why individual processes scale as power functions of mass or whythe causal cascade results in a whole-organism metabolism that approximates the3/4 rule (Bokma,2004;Westet al., 2003;West and Brown,2004).Third, dispute exists over whether there even is a universal scaling relationand whether ostensible patterns reflect internal biophysical constraints of any kind(Clarke,2004; Clarke and Fraser,2004;Kozlowski,1996;Kozlowski and Weiner,1997;Kozlowski and Konarzewski,2004). This is asserted for two reasons. For onething, it is claimed that the data do not support the model. This is because the 3/4rule itself is an artifact of an interspecific regression that traverses heterogeneousintraspecific regressions with independent slopes and intercepts and also becausefunctionalist explanations do not adequately account for the extremely large andhighly correlated residual variation (Kozlowski and Weiner,1997).6For another thing, it is maintained on theoretical grounds that metabolic and lifehistory variables interact with one another in the ecological context of each species,rather than being deterministically related to body mass for all species. The balancebetween these factors, and their relationship to body mass, reflects the ecologicalconditions unique to each species and, in principle, no meaningful interspecificgeneralization can be formulated. Several models of evolutionary tradeoffs havebeen proposed to explain the same data used by West and co-workers (Kozlowskiand Weiner,1997; Clarke,2004). However, like the above multiple-factor internalistaccounts, what the approach of viewing allometric trends as by-products does notdo is to explain why metabolic rate scales to body mass – even within species –as a power function to begin with. Nor does it explain the generalized patterns6Foranygiven mass, variation in metabolic rate may span an order of magnitude, and the same metabolic ratemay be found in organisms with 20–30-fold differences in mass. More importantly, the residual variation itselfis not random, and many life history parameters are still highly correlated even after being adjusted for mass(Kozlowski and Weiner,1997;Kozlowski and Konarzewski,2004)."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"15 Would Venus evolve on Mars?333across taxa, i.e. why certain proportions are more likely than others (Kozlowskiand Weiner,1997) and what constrains the distribution of possibilities on whichselection can act.So what can we conclude? The proposal for internal constraints represents apath-breaking attempt to explain long-observed patterns in biology, on the basis ofphysical first principles. And it not only fits the basic, coarse-grained allometric data,but also has fruitfully generated new hypotheses and has been used to explain a widearray of other observations as well. None of the alternative proposals accomplishesthis. However, it does not explain fine-grained patterns and significant deviationsfrom predictions, which appear to represent not mere noise but residual variationexplainable by other – most likely external – factors.Tosome extent, a disciplinary divide is at work here, as “probabilistic modelsderived from population biology and selection theory differ fundamentally fromengineering models, which depend on . . . the surface area of isometric bodies,or the structure of branching networks” (McNab,2002,p.35). This divide entailsdifferences not only in analytic approach, but also in evaluative criteria that haveboth polarized the dispute and made it difficult to resolve empirically. However,my point is that these tensions do not require a forced choice between explanatoryaccounts, which are not intrinsically irreconcilable. Internal constraints may fixthe allometric baseline, which selection may modify under certain circumstances.One of the postulates of West and co-workers’ model is that “organisms evolvetoward an optimal state in which the energy required for resource distribution isminimized” (West and Brown,2004,p.38). “Toward” is the key word here, andthe extent to which evolution attains any particular optimality target often reflectscompromise with other selective demands: physical first principles may constrainwhat is optimal, but do not always determine what is actual.Therefore, we can summarize with three conclusions that are analogous to whatwasaffirmed in the previous section. First, there are clear allometric trends thatrepresent convergence of scaling relations across a wide range of both taxa (bacteria,plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates) and organizational levels (organelles, cells,bodies, and ecosystems). Second, although the relative contribution of “internal”(biophysical) and “external” (selection) constraints is debated, no account of thesetrends – which include invariant relationships – interprets them as products ofprimarily contingent causes or passive radiation. And third, allometric trends arestrongly related to, and to some extent constitutive of, important life history trendsto which we now turn our attention.Life history across life’s history“Life history” refers to the timing and allocation of resources for growth, main-tenance, and reproduction over an organism’s lifetime. The size and number of"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"334JeffreyP.Schlossoffspring; investment in parental care; ovi- and viviparity; growth rate and adultbody size; and ages of reproductive maturity, reproductive cessation, and death arepresumably all under control of selection to optimize reproduction. These variablesdo not evolve independently of one another. Some are related by invariant ratios,and most occur in strategic constellations that represent significant directional andconvergent evolutionary trends.What I want to focus on is the capacity for selective interorganismal investment.This is represented by high degrees of parental care and social reciprocity, whichare positively associated with body size and lifespan and negatively associated withspecific metabolic rate and lifetime fecundity. A clear trend of investment increaseoverevolutionary time has been observed, although it involves an increase in max-imum and not mean investment. It represents a classic example of non-eliminative,passive – although apparently inevitable – diffusion away from a minimum. On theother hand, its coupling with other parameters is a driven or strongly constrainedtrend.As with the trends previously mentioned, proposals have been promulgated forinternal and external constraints. At first pass, it is tempting to account for relationsbetween life history variables almost purely on the basis of fundamental allometricconstraints. Metabolic rate, lifespan, fecundity, age at maturity, and maternal invest-ment all vary with body mass as power functions. In fact, relations are invariantbetween some of these variables. For example, lifespan scales with body mass by a1/4power, and heart rate (or the rate of ATP synthesis) scales with body mass by a−1/4power. The product yields an approximately constant number of “metabolicevents” in mammal species, independent of body mass or lifespan. Age at maturity /lifespan, and annual maternal investment / lifespan (for indeterminate growers), arealso invariant ratios (Charnov,1993; Charnovet al., 2001; Stearns,1992). West andBrown (2004) point out that invariant ratios, and universal quarter-power allomet-ric trends in general, suggest underlying physical first principles. They employtheir model to explain these life history relations (Enquistet al., 1999; Niklas andEnquist,2001;Westet al., 2001).However, the two types of criticism leveled (as I have argued, unconvincingly)at their application of physical principles to scaling of metabolic rate are moretelling against this being an adequatesingle-causeaccount of all these variables’relations to body size and one another. First, selection theory argues against aninflexible coupling of life history variables to mass (Calder,1984; Charnov,1993;Charnov et al.2001;Kozlowski,1996;Kozlowski and Weiner,1997;Kozlowski andKonarzewski,2004; Stearns,1992). This has recently been empirically confirmedby an elegant analysis that related life history traits in mammalian carnivores tobody sizes of extant species and their direct ancestors (Websteret al., 2004). In thosespecies that have recently undergone size change, life history variables were more"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"15 Would Venus evolve on Mars?335closely correlated with ancestral than present size; for example, phyletic giants havesmaller offspring, in larger, earlier, and more frequent litters, than similarly sizedspecies that have not recently become large. Therefore, life history variables, whichdo scale to body mass, may be coupled loosely by selection rather than rigidly bybiophysics.Second, and perhaps more importantly, both phyletic differences and residualanalysis of general relations have important stories to tell. For example, althoughage at maturity scales directly with average adult lifespan, the ratio decreases acrossvertebrate classes (fish, reptiles, mammals, birds), reflecting a gross trend towarditeroparity, or increased proportion of lifetime over which reproduction occurs.Regarding residuals, although length of maternal investment and annual fecundityscale with body mass (and hence each other), the residuals also scale with oneanother. That is, a strong negative relation exists between size-adjusted or relativefecundity and relative maternal investment (Stearns,1992). This is a crucial life his-tory trend in its own right, having an allometric but also an entirely size-independentcomponent. Bats and primates are at the upper end of the regression and also occupysimilar positions in residual analysis of lifespan and body mass. There is an evolu-tionary trend toward protracted lifespans, reduced fertility, and increased parentalinvestment beyond that predicted by first principles, and a linking of these featuresin a fashion that is not allometrically mediated.Here again the literature has become highly polarized, though it is not onlypossible but also necessary to avoid a false dichotomy. It is precisely the contributionof both internal and external constraints that is most noteworthy in these trends. Theimportant conclusion is that natural selection has found a way of both employingand “amplifying” allometrically mediated relations between life history variablesto generate organisms that invest more resources, with more selectivity, over greatertimescales. Physical first principles underlie but do not wholly determine this.Asalient example of interaction between internal and external constraints inlife history trends involves the issue of lifespan or the timing of senescence anddeath, which also turns out to have newly posited implications for investment. Onthe one hand, lifespan has been interpreted as reflecting fundamental allometricconstraints (Westet al., 2001;West and Brown,2004). Larger organisms havelower specific metabolic rates and tend to live longer. This is consistent with thequarter power account of biological time (West and Brown,2004) and concordswith metabolic damage (e.g. telomere damage, free-radical accumulation) or “rateof living” theories of aging (Finch,1990; Rose,1991).On the other hand, evolutionary theories of aging posit that the timing of senes-cence is mechanistically determined not by metabolically induced damage, butrather, by selection’s response toexternalmortality factors. In fact, there shouldbe no senescence at all in the absence of external causes of death. The extent to"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"336JeffreyP.Schlosswhich an organism invests in repairing damage will reflect the externally mediatedlikelihood that an investment in maintenance at any given point in the lifespan willresult in sufficient additional reproductive opportunities to pay the investment backin future progeny. More generally, selection will allow the accumulation of dele-terious mutations that are expressed late in life, when an organism’s reproductivepotential is low (Medawar,1952; Hamilton,1966). And it will actually promote,through antagonistic pleiotropy, traits that increase reproduction early in life at theexpense of dysfunction later in life (Kirkwood,1977;Williams,1957). Variousexperimental (Rose,1984, 1991;Tyneret al., 2002) and observational (Keller andGenoud,1997; Sherman and Jarvis,2002) studies support this, which are not madesense of by first-principle, rate of living accounts.As before, both internal and external constraints – entailed in this case by rateof living and evolutionary theories of aging – can operate simultaneously, indeedinteractively. But neither has done a good job of explaining certain unexpectedmortality patterns that some highly social species exhibit at the beginning and endof life. Although both approaches predict that mortality rates will increase withage across the lifespan, in some species with high parental care infant mortalityactually decreases as juveniles mature, and these species also exhibit protractedpost-reproductive longevity. Enter the first theory to incorporate parental care –or “transfer of benefits” as opposed to brute fertility – as the major determinantof mortality, and of life history under some circumstances (Lee,2003). In demo-graphic conditions where intensive parental care is essential to survival of progeny,selection may more effectively eliminate deleterious traits in offspring that havealready incurred high parental investment (hence the declining juvenile mortalitywith age). This approach also explains how selection can operate against antag-onistic pleiotropy or accumulation of mutations that are expressed later in life.Anticipated by the notion of a “grandmother effect,” in which post-reproductiveindividuals can still very significantly enhance fitness by caring for progeny ortheir kin (Williams,1957), Lee formalizes this in a model that integrates economicexchange, demography, and population genetics. Because it provides a unifiedaccount for mortality patterns across the entire lifespan, it has been referred to as“the most comprehensive evolutionary theory of aging that we have seen to date”(Rogers,2003,p.9115).In fact, under certain circumstances, the ability to “transfer benefits” to progenyor kin, rather than the maximization of lifetime fertility, becomes the primary con-trolling parameter for other life history characters. An organism’s entire life historystrategy may be optimized for this. In addition to providing a unified explanation forpatterns that previously appeared anomalous, this life history theory is significantin that it explicitly posits a driven, directional trend. It entails “a positive feedbackloop that selects for reduced fertility, higher consumption, greater investments injuveniles, and longer life. This describes the evolution of primates and other kinds"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"15 Would Venus evolve on Mars?337of species with low fertility, heavy investment in offspring, and long adult life”(Lee,2003,p.9640). In contrast to some representations of the debate over int-ernal/external constraints, this feedback loop involves an inevitable convergencethat is driven not just by internal biophysical, but by external selective, constraints.Adistinctive, and I will suggest a beautiful, implication of the theory is itsemphasis not only on the phylogenetic, but also on the ontogenetic intensificationof investment or resource transfer. The progressive transition from receiving togiving benefits is itself a life history parameter that changes developmentally overthe lifespan, a notion Lee considered calling the “live to give” theory (Wade,2003).Is there, in this theory, a ground for rehabilitating Alfred Tennyson’s dashed hopein “love Creation’s final law”? Although that affirmation of Romanticism may bea bit too saccharine in light of evolutionary ambiguity, a profound and escalatingother-orientation does appear to constitute a fundamental biotic strategy.Conclusion: trends, progress, and purpose in evolutionIbegan this chapter by observing, and lamenting, the fact that discussions of evo-lutionary trends have frequently been polarized by divergent theological or philo-sophical precommitments. However, seeking to avoid metaphysical biases need notmean refusing to reflect on theological implications. I want to conclude with somebrief comments on the significance of these issues. To do so, I distinguish betweenevolutionary trends (change in a given direction), progress (change in a valueddirection; Ayala,1988), and purpose (regulated change in a targeted direction).First, fashionable pronouncements of disteleology notwithstanding, there is littleroom to doubt the existence of significant life history trends in evolutionary history.This entails the convergent arising, biased retention, and directional elaborationof fundamental organic structures and functional strategies that increase selectiveinvestment. Such increases appear to be the inevitable result of both fundamentalbiophysical and selective constraints. Moreover, these trends involve a genuinelyinteresting story, or to return to our initial metaphor, an evolutionary play whoseplot involves increasing size, energy, complexity, diversity, longevity, and affiliativeinvestment. This is, in a real sense, increasingly abundantlife(Jonas,1966).As I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, it is possible, even tempting, toreflect on this in a couple of ways. First, one may marvel at the stage and calculatethe odds of its having been designed without input from the playwright. This isthe domain of environmental fitness or fine-tuning arguments, emphasizing whatIhave called “necessary preconditions.” Second, one may marvel at the way thestage supports thisparticulardrama and wonder whether it could have turned outdifferently in this theater. This is the domain of inevitability arguments entailingsufficient constraints or preconditions, which I have been emphasizing. Both ofthese enterprises are legitimate, and each is interesting. But both may fail to focus"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"338JeffreyP.Schlosson the message of the play itself. Like some forms of biblical fundamentalism thatseem to place more emphasis on the method of textual inspiration than on the largermeaning of scriptural revelation, one may be so caught up in the architecture ofthe physico-chemical stage that one does not adequately engage the drama of theevolutionary play.Second, what then can be said about the “message” of the script itself? Here againIwant to question theZeitgeistand maintain that, by any reasonable sense of theword “progress,” evolutionary drama is filled with it, by virtue of an ongoing, serialintensification of the wondrous qualities of life itself. Theologian John Haught,who contributed a chapter to this volume, maintains that “Surely, by any objectivestandard of measurement, something momentous has been going on here . . . an over-arching inclination...towardtheheightening of beauty” (Haught,2005,p.520).Philosopher Hans Jonas (1966) refers to the evolutionary epic as the “the ascent ofsoul.” In response to qualms that such a judgment is parochially anthropomorphic,he contends it is appropriatelyzoomorphic. I would suggest that all of the majortrends discussed in this paper build on one another to constitute a suite of bioticcapacities that are jointly necessary for what we would call “love” or “relationalcommitment.” This surely constitutes progress, change in a valued direction.However, I want to point out two profound ambiguities in this “progress.” First,as indicated earlier, none of these trends is eliminative. Even if they constituteprogress, the “world” is not getting better, in terms of either a modal increase inbeneficence or an attenuation of natural evil. Second, these capacities for affilia-tive investment that underlie love and commitment are necessary, but by no meanssufficient. For one reason, other capacities are required that lie beyond the scopeof this paper (and may or may not be outside the domains of existing biologicaltheory; [Schloss,2004]). For another and more important reason, these capaci-ties are just that – capacities, and not deterministic inclinations – to act in certainways. In fact, behavioral plasticity increases along with the strategic assemblageof these capacities (Changizi,2003). Thus, the cognitive and affective capacities,and life history and social contexts, that give rise to attachment, altruism, or moralcommitment, may also facilitate manipulation, spite, or deceptive moral posturing.Ultimately, evolutionary “progress” is morally ambiguous. Like the biblical story ofcreation, it involves the origin of potentiality for, but not inevitability of, creaturelygoodness, and the increase of this biological capacity is also coupled with anincreased capacity for suffering (Schloss,2002).Finally, does it make sense to speak of evolutionary purpose? At one level, theanswer to this question is easy. Like all mechanistic processes, evolution is non-purposive. In fact, natural selection is explicitly formulated as a non-teleologicalalternative to explanatory accounts invoking purposeful design. But supernaturalmetaphysics aside, there is a naturalistic context in which it could make scientific"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"15 Would Venus evolve on Mars?339sense to speak of evolutionary purpose in a way analogous to the teleonomic,goal-oriented, or purposive behavior of living organisms. Living systems exhibit“regulated change in a targeted direction.” Evolutionary change could be construedas purposive if: (a) its directionality were targeted or specified (perhaps by pre-existing or emergent environmental information) and (b) the process were adjustedby regulatory feedback loops (perhaps involving ecosystem- or biospheric-levelinteractions, e.g. Gaia). Although notions of environmental fitness or biochemicalfine-tuning could and probably do contribute to the first requirement, the second,although it is fully naturalistic in principle, lies outside our current ability to assessempirically. Lee (2003) and Demetrius (1997, 2000)doprovide conceptual pro-posals for how such directional feedback might occur in selection.But the question of evolutionary purpose has another meaning, which involvesnot so much the purposesofevolution, but the possible purposesbehindevolution.Can evolution, particularly the trends discussed here, be reasonably viewed asreflecting, even instantiating, purposes that transcend the process itself? Here againthe spirit of the age is far from shy. A virulent natural atheology (Lustig,2004)asserts that ascribing divine purpose to evolution is not only methodologicallyillegitimate, but also rationally incoherent (Dawkins,2003; Gould,1989, 1996;Rachels,1990;Williams,1993). Evolutionary history is represented as involvingsuch great waste and suffering, resulting in such little if any directional progress,it is asserted that one who wishes to believe in a God behind evolution should beprepared to believe in “a monster” (Williams,1993). Sadly, many traditional theistshave either uncritically accepted or actively promoted the same view. I want toclose by maintaining that the emerging understandings of evolutionary constraintdescribed in this chapter, and in other chapters in this volume, are consistent with,even suggestive of, divine purpose. But they are by no means demonstrative of orsimplistically concordant with it. This very ambiguity is itself quite important forscience and theology, both of which suffer when science is distorted to promoteafalse nihilism or co-opted to bolster a mechanistic optimism about the fate ofthe cosmos. As Pascal maintained centuries before evolutionary theory, the naturalworld affords enough light to allow, but enough shadow to require, theological hoperather than religious or nihilistic certainty.ReferencesAllen, A.

If anyone, besides the biochemist, may befit to recognize such marvels on the molecular level and put them into a properperspective, it is the synthetic organic chemist, who tends to judge any new discov-ered molecular structure or process by the criterion of whether he could do such athing himself: “If I had to, could I make this?” The question reflects a dichotomy,epistemological in nature, that has been with the science of organic chemistry fromthe very beginning: the two-fold task of studying molecules occurring in nature andcreating by chemical synthesis molecules that have never existed before. Chemi-cal synthesis has traditionally been the organic chemist’s major tool for exploringthe molecular world: the ability to synthesize molecules of ever-increasing com-plexity that mirror those produced by living nature has been a significant measureof progress in organic chemistry as a whole. Yet, the gap between what chemistsare able to create by chemical synthesis and what nature achieves in biosynthesisremains immense.Fortunately, it is inspiration rather than resignation that chemists are drawingfrom this gap, and they are encouraged to do so by considering how chemicalthought and the chemist’s ability to make molecules have changed in the courseof the past two centuries. Today, many organic chemists are shifting their researchinterest towards the chemistry–biology interface. There, besides encountering amultitude of new scientific and technological challenges, they come in contact withthe principles and problems of evolutionary thinking, a different way of looking atFitness of the Cosmos for Life: Biochemistry and Fine-Tuning,ed.

Barrowet al.Published by Cambridge University Press.C\u0001Cambridge University Press 2007.349"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"350Albert Eschenmoserthe world and one that has been historically completely foreign to their core field.One of the purely scientific challenges at this interface is etiological in nature,namely, the quest for chemists to join biologists in addressing problems of origin.Their challenge here is to pursue such problems on the territory of chemistry, todefine them at the chemist’s level of looking at molecules, and to tackle them byusing the chemist’s tools – not the least of which is chemical synthesis. The ultimatefocus of such etiological research on the territory of chemistry will be the searchfor the chemistry of life’s origin, the problem at which chemistry and biology maybe expected to mesh in the most fundamental way.Modern molecular biology’s mechanistic demystification of the material aspectsof life does not mean that we have lost our ability to stand in awe before themolecular “miracles” happening within living cells; such emotions differentiateus from “research robots.” Yet in no way are these emotions supposed to implyor express doubts about the basic paradigm of contemporary science. Surely, itmust have been such “standing in awe” before thought-provoking coincidencesthat induced Lawrence J. Henderson, almost one hundred years ago, to writeThe Fitness of the Environment(1913). However, his central message, althoughit remains thought-provoking today, failed to become an explicit part of main-stream science because it seemed to transcend limits that the chemistry and biologyof the twentieth century had set for themselves as fundamental natural sciences.Specifically, these disciplines showed a tendency to deny, ignore, postpone, or“outsource” interest in phenomena, questions, and views that paradigmatic rea-soning concluded were not, or perhaps not yet, accessible to scientific inquiry.More recently, however, Henderson’s bold vision of an innate biocentricity implicitwithin our universe has been forcefully echoed in debates within contemporarycosmology. Such debates concern the epistemological status of provocative pro-nouncements such as the “anthropic principle(s)” or, more mildly, the role in sci-ence of what is referred to as “anthropic reasoning,” a topic amply discussed inother chapters of this volume. Almost needless to say, any debate such as thisis bound to emanate beyond the limits of natural science into other realms ofhuman thought. Therefore, it seems consistent and timely that the John Tem-pleton Foundation has responded to an initiative of interested cosmologists byorganizing an interdisciplinary workshop commemorating the 1913 publication ofHenderson’s book. The workshop juxtaposed the thoughts and expertise of cos-mologists, biochemists, and evolutionary biologists with regard to the question ofwhether the cosmologists’ perception of “fine-tuning of the fundamental param-eters of physics toward life” has any counterpart on the level of contemporarybiochemistry.In attempting to retrospectively analyze the goal and outcome of the workshopfrom the point of view of the chemist, it is helpful to begin with the original"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"16 Creating a perspective for comparing351wording of three (of the five) core questions that this workshop was asked toaddress:1.Do analogs to the fine-tuned biocentric parameters in physics and cosmology exist inbiochemistry?2.How can this question be addressed adequately within biochemistry?3.Might fine-tuning in biochemistry be fundamentally different from fine-tuning in physicsand cosmology?With hindsight, I think that the discussions seeded by these questions at the work-shop turned out to be handicapped by an underlying misunderstanding between thecosmologists (interrogators) and the biochemists (those being interrogated). Thebiochemist tends to use the term “fine-tuned” intuitively and qualitatively, thinkingof the physical and chemical properties of matter, very much as Henderson did.Tothe cosmologist, a statement such as “the fundamental parameters of physicsseem fine-tuned toward life” is based on data obtained by counterfactual varia-tion of fundamental physical parameters and theoretical calculations of the effectssuch variation would have on the structure and the properties of the universe. Inessence, the initiators of the workshop expected their biochemical colleagues tocomment on two questions: first, whether the effects of counterfactual variationin fundamental physical parameters could be delineated on the biochemical leveland whether signs of “fine-tuning” might be discernible on this level; and, second,whether the tool of counterfactual variation itself could be applicable at the levelof biochemistry (in the sense of varying counterfactually physico-chemical param-eters and evaluating by theory the effect of such variation on vital biochemicalprocesses).In this context, it is illuminating to remember that chemistry in the eighteenthand nineteenth centuries became an independent branch of natural science becausephysicists had “outsourced” the study of the transformations of “chemical matter”to chemists; such phenomena seemed too complex and too foreign to commonexperience at the time to be rendered in the physicist’s language of mathematics.Analogously, in the late nineteenth and in the twentieth century, biochemistry andmolecular biology became independent branches of natural science as chemistshad “outsourced” investigations of biopolymers and the living cell as structureswith properties too complex to be analyzed by chemical methods and expressedin the language of chemistry. Today, of course, we know better. Chemistry, withthe help of physics, has become a widely quantifying science; biochemistry andmolecular biology, largely with the help of physical methods, have become thesciences that deal with the chemistry of the living cell. This nothwithstanding,no contemporary biochemist (at least of the ilk of this author) would think thatcounterfactual variations of fundamental physical parameters could be translated"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"352Albert EschenmoserCytosineGuanineAdenineThymineHFigure 16.1.

With respect to this degree of challenge, chemistryremains an empirical science, biology even more clearly so. In this sense, therewould have been no way that the biochemists present at the workshop could havelived up to the optimistic expectations of the cosmologists.Thus remains the question of whether the tool of counterfactual variation, appliedto parameters at the level of biochemistry (implying physico-chemical parameters)could provide specifically biochemical evidence for matter being fine-tuned towardlife. In principle, Henderson had done just that in an intuitive and qualitative way acentury ago. But is there not more to be said today? My view is that the underlyingproblem remains unchanged. I want to illustrate the point in more detail by meansof a recently considered example (see Figure16.1): Watson–Crick base-pairing ofoligonucleotides (Eschenmoser,2001; Groebkeet al., 1998).

The positions of these equilibria in a given environment are anintrinsic property of these molecules, determined by their physico-chemical param-eters (and thus, ultimately, by the fundamental physical constants of this universe).The chemist masters the Herculean task of grasping and classifying the bound-less diversity of the constitution of organic molecules by using the concept ofthe “chemical bond.” He pragmatically deals with the differences in the thermo-dynamic stability of molecules by using individual energy parameters, which heempirically assigns to the various types of bonds in such a way that he can simplyadd up the number and kind of bonds present in the chemical formula of a moleculeand use their associated average bond energies to estimate the relative energy con-tent of essentially any given organic molecule.2As it happens, the average bondenergy of a carbon–oxygen double bond is about 30 kcal per mol higher than thatof a carbon–carbon or carbon–nitrogen double bond, a difference that reflects thefact that ketones normally exist as ketones and not as their enol-tautomers.3If(in the sense of a “counterfactual variation”) the difference between the averagebond energy of a carbon–oxygen double bond and that of a carbon–carbon andcarbon–nitrogen double bond were smaller by a few kcal per mol, then the nucle-obases guanine, cytosine, and thymine would exist as “enols” and not as “ketones,”and Watson–Crick base-pairing would not exist – nor would the kind of life weknow.It looks as though this is providing a glimpse of what might appear (to thoseinclined) as biochemical fine-tuning of life. However, I agree with Paul Davies’comment at the workshop: in order for the proposed change of the bond energy ofa carbon–oxygen double bond to be a proper counterfactual variation of a physico-chemical parameter, we concomitantly would have to change the bond energiesof all other bonds occurring in the chemical formulae of the nucleobases in suchaway that we would remain internally consistent within the frame of molecularphysics. To do this in a theory-based way is not feasible because the average ener-gies assigned to (isolated) chemical bonds are empirical parameters that have nodirect equivalents in quantum-mechanical models of organic molecules. Without the1This statement has a remarkable precedent in the history of the discovery of the DNA double helix: Jim Watsonand Francis Crick’s efforts to build a model of DNA remained futile as long as Jerry Donohue had not told themthat they were using the wrong tautomers for the nucleobases (Watson,1968).2Such a sum of the average bond energies for a given organic molecule approximates the energy change involvedin the formation of one mole of the molecule from the corresponding free atoms (gaseous). Average bondenergies of chemical bonds symbolized in the chemical formulae of organic molecules are in the range of 35–120 kcal/mol (single bonds) and 100–180 kcal/mol (double bonds). The bond-energy values for carbon–carbondouble bonds are around 145 kcal/mol and those of carbon–oxygen double bonds (carbonyl bonds) around175 kcal/mol (Roberts and Caserio,1977).3Tautomers are isomers that differ in the position of hydrogen atoms and can rapidly transform themselves intoeach other."},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"354Albert Eschenmoserpossibility of calculating bond energies from first principles, average bond energiescannot be meaningfully used as a parameter for counterfactual variation.On the other hand, calculating the position of tautomeric equilibria in nucleo-bases is certainly within the grasp of contemporary quantum chemistry, and semi-empirical physico-chemical parameters on which the positions of these equilibriamight most sensitively depend could presumably be identified. Whether in thisspecial case it would be feasible and conceptually proper to attempt an internallyconsistent variation of physico-chemical parameters followed by calculation ofassociated properties for resulting virtual nucleobases is a question to be answeredby a quantum chemist rather than an experimentalist. It nevertheless would seemthat Watson–Crick pairing is a promising target (for those so inclined) in a theory-consistent search for a biochemical example of fine-tuning of chemical mattertoward life. It represents an example of a question referring to existence that mightbe reduced to a question of the position of chemical equilibrium between tautomers.Irrespective of the outcome of such a search, the cascade of coincidences embod-ied in nature’s canonical nucleobases will remain, from a chemical point of view,an extraordinary case of evolutionary contingency on the molecular level (even tothose unconcerned about the question of a biocentric universe). The generationalsimplicity of these bases when compared with their relative constitutional com-plexity,4their capacity to communicate with one another in specific pairs throughhydrogen bonding within oligonucleotides, and, finally, the role they were to takeoveratthe dawn of life and to play at the heart of biology ever since is extraordinary.Ihave little doubt that Henderson – could he have known it – would have addedthese coincidences to his list of facts that were, to him, convincing evidence for theenvironment’s fitness to life.Let us then assume, for the sake of argument, that the equilibria between thetautomers of the nucleobases prevented Watson–Crick base-pairing of the kind weknow. Would there be an alternative higher form of life? If we were to answer inthe affirmative – aware of the immense diversity of the structures and properties oforganic molecules and conscious of the creative powers of evolution – could wehave any idea of what such a life form might look like, chemically? The helplessnessthat overwhelms us as chemists in being confronted with such a question can giverise to two different reactions. Some of us would seek comfort in declaring that suchquestions do not belong to science, and others would simply be painfully remindedof how little we really know and comprehend of the potential of chemical matterto become and to be alive. Our insight into the creativity of biological evolution4The constitution of the canonical purines and pyrimidines is relatively complex with regard to content andpositioning of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms in their molecules, yet simple from the pointof view of their (experimentally documented) formation from elementary (potentially geochemical) startingmaterials such as hydrocyanic acid, cyanamide, cyanoacetylene, and water (see, for example, Ferris and Hagan,1984). The most remarkable member is adenine, a “simple” pentamer of HCN (Oro and Kimball,1960)."},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"16 Creating a perspective for comparing355on the molecular level is far too narrow for us to judge by biochemical reasoningwhat would have happened to the origin and the evolution of life if they had had tooccur and operate in a world of (slightly) different physico-chemical parameters. Ishall return to this point below.Statements about fine-tuning toward life in cosmology referring to criteria suchas the potential of a universe to form heavy elements and planets are in a categoryfundamentally different from statements about fine-tuning of physico-chemicalparameters toward life at the level of biochemistry. Whatever biological phenomenaappear fine-tuned can be interpreted in principle as the result of life having fine-tuned itself to the properties of matter through natural selection. Indeed, to interpretin this way what we observe in the living world is mainstream thinking withincontemporary biology and biological chemistry. Thus, life science and cosmologyare in very different positions when it comes to the question of how to interpret, oreven identify, data that point to fine-tuning. To return to our example: in biology,the existence of a central feature such as Watson–Crick base-pairing may be seen asan achievement of life’s evolutionary exploration of, and adaption to, the chemicalpotential of matter on planet earth. In cosmology, there is no corresponding wayto interpret the formation of, let us say, a planet, and proposals of “evolutionary”universe-selection imposed on multiverse models would fall short of creating acorrespondence.Mainstream thinking in biology that unconditionally traces everything observedin the living world back to the known and (still) unknown powers of Darwinianevolution is, at its roots, the expression of a “dogmatized Occamism” that fun-damentally dominates natural science. Needless to say, at the edges of scientificinquiry, such as the potential biocentricity of our universe, cultural imprinting, pre-conceptions, and personal inclinations are bound to participate, admittedly or not,to an unusually large degree in our scientific reasoning. Prejudices at a dynamicborderline of science are legitimate and can be important (provided its supportersaccept them to be potentially transient) because research, stimulated by prejudiceand taken up and forcefully pursued by the prejudiced, may eventually lead toinsights that become a generally accepted part of science. Such prejudicial inquirybecomes harmful to scientific progress only when it fails to cede in the light ofcontinuing negative evidence.On the question of life’s biochemical uniquenessIf fundamental parameters of physics, acting through the properties of existingchemical matter, were fine-tuned toward life, then how sharply determined are theparameters of the life to which these physical parameters are “fine-tuned”?

How biochemically diversecoulda library of different lifechemistries be while maintaining compatibility with the physics that we know?At least in principle, chemistry could offer a strategy to find out, such as by creat-ing, through chemical synthesis, alternative biologies and systematically comparingtheir biochemistries with that of “natural” biology. Needless to say, such a thingis (at present) out of reach. But within reach here and now is the ability to adhereto the general strategy ofcreating alternatives to apparent uniqueness for the sakeof gaining a perspective for comparingby applying this strategy to modest, yetnevertheless significant, biomolecular targets such as the structure type of life’sbasic informational polymers, the nucleic acids.For such a project, the strategy may read as follows. Conceive (through chemicalreasoning) potentially natural alternatives to the structure of RNA; synthesize suchalternatives by chemical methods; compare them with RNA with respect to thosechemical properties that are fundamental to its biological function (Eschenmoser,1999). Fortunately for this special case of the nucleic acids, it is not at all problematicto decide what the most important of these properties has to be: it must be thecapability to undergo informational Watson–Crick base-pairing. The relevance ofthe perspective created in such a project will strongly depend on the specific choiceof the alternatives’ chemical structures. The quest is to focus on systems deemed tobe potentially natural in the sense that they could have formed, according to chemicalreasoning, by the very same type of chemistry that (under unknown circumstances)must have been operating on earth (or elsewhere) at the time when and at the placewhere the structure type of RNA was born. Candidates that lend themselves tothis choice are oligonucleotide systems, the structures of which are derivable from(CH2O)nsugars (n=4, 5, 6) by the type of chemistry that allows the structure ofnatural RNA to be derived from the C5-sugar ribose (see Figure16.2). This approachis based on the supposition that RNA structure originated through a process that wascombinatorial in nature with respect to the assembly and functional selection of aninformational system within the domain of sugar-based oligonucleotides. In a way,the investigation is an attempt to mimic the selection filter of such a natural processby chemical means, irrespective of whether RNA first appeared in an abiotic or abiotic environment.In retrospect, the results of systematic experimental investigations carried outalong these lines justify the effort (see Figure16.3). It is found that hexopyranosylanalogs of RNA (with backbones containing six carbons per sugar unit insteadof five carbons and six-membered pyranose rings instead of five-membered fura-nose rings) do not possess the capability of efficient informational Watson–Crickbase-pairing. Therefore, these systems could not have acted as functional com-petitors of RNA in nature’s choice of a genetic system, even though these six-carbon alternatives of RNA should have had a comparable chance of being formed"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"OBAS EOPOOOOOPOOOHOOBASEOOPOOOOBASEHOOOPOOOHOBASEOOOPOOHOOOBASEOOHOOBASEOPOOOOHOBAS EOOPOOOOOPOOOOOHBASEOOPOOOOBASEDNAOOPOOOOOHBAS EOHOOPOOOOOHBASEHOOOPOOOOHOBASEOHOBASEOOPOOORNAOOOPOOOBASETETRO-FURANOSYL(3'→2')(4'→2')(4'→3')riboriboxylolyxoarabinolyxoPENTO-PYRANOSYLPENTO-FURANOSYL(5'→3')HEXO-PYRANOSYL(6'→4')glucoaltroallohomo-DNAPENTO-PYRANOSYLthreoerythroFigure 16.2.

The reason for their failure revealed itselfin chemical model studies: six-carbon-six-membered-ring sugars are found to betoo bulky to adapt to the steric requirements of Watson–Crick base-pairing withinoligonucleotide duplexes. In sharp contrast, an entire family of nucleic acid alter-natives in which each member comprises repeating units of one of the four possiblefive-carbon sugars (ribose being one of them) turned out to be highly efficient infor-mational base-pairing systems. All of them contain their five-carbon sugar in thesix-membered pyranose form, all of them show a base-pairing strength that is higherthan that of natural RNA, and all of them possess duplex structures quite distinctfrom that of RNA and DNA (quasi-linear ladder structures; see Figure 16.4). Theyall are able to communicate by Watson–Crick cross-pairing among each other, butare unable to do so with RNA or DNA. They “speak another language.”More recently, the systematic exploration of alternative nucleic-acid systemsfrom RNA’s structural neighborhood has presented us with a further challeng-ing observation. TNA, the threose-analog of RNA (a system containing only fourinstead of five carbon atoms in its sugar building block), turns out to be a mar-velous Watson–Crick base-pairing system. Indeed, not only is TNA very similar to"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"16 Creating a perspective for comparing359RNA in its base-pairing properties, but it is also much more resistant to hydrolyticdecay, and, above all (in sharp contrast to the pyranose form of RNA), it speaks thesame “base-pairing language” as RNA and DNA (Sch ̈oninget al., 2000). TNA is aprovocative alternative nucleic-acid system, not only because of its RNA-like prop-erties, but also because of its structural simplicity. With its four-carbons-only sugarbuilding block, it is a simpler type of molecule than RNA (the simplest syntheticpathway to the four-carbon sugar threose requires one single C2-starting material,that to a five-carbon sugar requires in addition a C1-component). Not surprisingly,therefore, the question has been raised as to whether this system could have ful-filled the role of the, or an, ancestor of RNA (Orgel,2000). The interest in such aconjecture may be seen to lie primarily in the question of what kind of experimentsit induces. Rather remarkable results have already come forward in other labora-tories from such experiments. Certain DNA polymerases were found to be ableto faithfully transcribe TNA sequences into complementary DNA sequences andvice versa (Chaput and Szostak,2003;Kempeneerset al., 2003). While of interestfrom an etiological point of view, such observations also throw new light on theamazing structural versatility of modern DNA polymerases and may open the doorto applying the methods ofin vitroevolution to the nucleic-acid alternative TNA(Chaput and Szostak,2003).What lessons do the observations made so far on the base-pairing properties ofpotential nucleic-acid alternatives teach us? First,the capability of Watson–Crickbase-pairing is by no means unique to the natural nucleic acidsand is not boundto the type of double-helix structure occurring in DNA, as had been quite generallyassumed before.5Furthermore,nature did not choose RNA among possible altern-atives by pursuing the strategy of maximizing base-pairing strength.For instance,starting from the very same building blocks and using the same type of chem-istry that led to RNA, nature could have easily arrived at the pyranose formof RNA (see Figure16.4). Watson–Crick pairing would have been not onlystronger, but even more selective than in the natural isomer. Pyranosyl-RNAis a system that would also have been more resistant to hydrolytic decay thanRNA. Hence, this six-membered ring isomer of RNA is perhaps the most rel-evant reference point that we have today for identifying assets of natural RNAstructure that made it the (putatively) superior system among the alternativesfrom RNA’s structural neighborhood and, therefore, the one that became partof the biology we know today. Can we see hints of why nature chose one andnot the other? Properties such as relative backbone flexibility (greater in RNA)and base-pairing strength (greater in pyranosyl-RNA) come immediately to mind5This insight has been extensively supported and extended by the results of the contemporary search in medicinalchemistry for structural nucleic-acid variants that may have the potential of acting as antisense agents (see, forexample, Hyrup and Nielsen,1996; Herdewijn,1996; Leumann,2002)."},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"360Albert Eschenmoser(see Figure16.2). High base-pairing strength can facilitate template-assisted growthof oligomer strands in duplexes, but can hamper replication because of strongerproduct inhibition. However, when we consider in detail the task of comparing andevaluating assets, it becomes clear that really nothing is straightforward. This isbecause chemical fitness does not necessarily parallel biological fitness, and we donot know how far life’s evolution had advanced by the time RNA became selected.Ta kethe difference in backbone flexibility between the pyranose form of RNAand natural RNA: in the former, two out of the six chemical bonds per backboneunit are rotationally constrained (part of a ring), whereas RNA has only one suchconstrained bond (see Figure16.2). How can we know what this “small” consti-tutional difference would imply for the diversity of molecular shapes in long basesequences and, in turn, for the diversity of catalytic capabilities of these shapes and,ultimately, for the evolvability of an emerging biological system that had to oper-ate with either of these alternative nucleic-acid systems? Such questions forciblyremind us of limitations associated with the task of looking at the molecular levelfor the existence of cosmophysical and physico-chemical fine-tuning toward theuniqueness of the life that we know. Although our experimental observations indi-cate that nature, in selecting the molecular structure of her genetic system, had otheroptions available besides RNA, the notion we naturally would be inclined to con-sider – namely, that RNA might be the biologically fittest of them all – remains but aconjecture.The work done thus far has been deliberately restricted to nucleic acid back-bone structures that belong to the close structural neighborhood of RNA. Thereis an important reason for this. The closer the structural relationship between achosen alternative and RNAs, the more reliably we can reason that the alternativerepresents a potentially natural molecular structure and thus could have been anevolutionary competitor of RNA (irrespective of whether the RNA structure is ofprebiotic or biotic origin). The etiological relevance of nucleic-acid alternativesthat are structurallyunrelatedto RNA is a much greater problem because of ourincreased uncertainty regarding their generation under environmental conditionsthat prevailed at RNA’s origin. It nevertheless behoves us to ask whether naturecould have had at its disposal genetic oligomers that are built not of sugar (phos-phate) units, but of other types of building blocks. Inescapably, such inquiry willeventually touch on one of contemporary life’s most fundamental features: the struc-tural and functional separation of genotype and phenotype at the molecular level.From a chemical point of view, its realization in the course of evolution demandedso extraordinary an innovation – the entanglement of genotype and phenotype bymeans of the former codifying the synthesis of the latter – that its emergence froma non-living environment seems inconceivable, at least in the form that we knowtoday. A conceptually attractive escape from the dilemma is the idea of an RNA"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"16 Creating a perspective for comparing361Figure 16.4.

This idea, since the time of its resurrection (Gilbert,1986)in the wake of the discovery of ribozymes (Krugeret al., 1982; Guerrier-Takadaet al., 1983), has received an impressive amount of empirical support (Gestelandet al., 1999). To the chemist, its conceptual attractiveness resides in its replacing theneed for a complexchemicalinformation-transferbetweenmolecules (taking placein today’s ribosomes) with that for a ubiquitous type ofphysicalprocesswithinmolecules. In other words, in any RNA molecule that folds itself into a catalyti-cally active structure, the constitution (base sequence) automatically “codes” for themolecule’s conformation by reasons having their roots in molecular physics. This,in turn, co-determines the molecule’s shape and, therewith, its functional (catalytic)capabilities.The concept of the RNA world forcibly raises the question of RNA’s origin.Experience over the years with the demanding requisites of the generational chem-istry of the different types of oligonucleotides and their building blocks makes meshare the belief of those who think that RNA could hardly have assembled itselfand initiated an evolutionary process in a prebiotic world (Joyce and Orgel,1999).This means that we must consider RNA as originating from a biotic environment,the chemobiological nature of which is completely unknown to us. To throw light"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"362Albert Eschenmoseron this unknown territory is a major challenge to chemistry. It may be nothing lessthan the quest for the chemical roots of life. Thus, the systematic chemical studyof nucleic-acid alternatives, originally directed at the question of life’s chemicaluniqueness, will eventually have to merge with the search for the chemistry of life’sorigin.The search for the chemistry of life’s originThe search for the chemistry of life’s origin has been going on under the head-ing “prebiotic chemistry” since the advent of the Miller–Urey experiment half acentury ago (Miller,1953). Today, the elementary and potentially prebiotic natureof the basic building blocks of contemporary life’s fundamental biopolymers, thealpha-amino acids, the sugars, and the nucleobases, is considered to be established(Oro and Kimball,1960; Miller and Orgel,1974). On a purely chemical level ofexperimentation, it has also been shown that oligonucleotide base sequences can betranscribed into complementary sequences without enzymes (Sulstonet al., 1968;Orgel,1992) and that some short sequences are even able to replicate autocata-lytically (von Kiedrowski,1986;Orgel,1992). However, these experiments werecarried out under constraints and conditions that are so specific that they do notnecessarily demonstrate the capability of nucleic acids to self-replicate autocata-lytically under potentially prebiotic conditions. Remarkably, certain oligopeptideshave also been shown to possess the capability of acting as templates that autocata-lyze their own formation by ligating hemi-complementary oligopeptides, directedby sequence-dependent recognition factors such as lipophilicity and hydrophilicityof amino-acid side chains (Leeet al., 1996). The exploratory chemical studies onself-replication in both the oligonucleotide and oligopeptide series reflect a clas-sical dichotomy concerning the origin of the kind of life we know – namely, theold question of what might have been first: nucleic acids or proteins? Although thisdichotomy is narrowly confined to structures that are known from contemporarybiology, it reflects a broader (although not necessarily closely related) dichotomythat refers to function: should the search for the chemistry of life’s origin focus onprimordial genetic or primordial metabolic function? The “geneticists’” school ofthought (Eigen,1971) maintains that life began with the first successful informa-tional replicator, whereas the “metabolists” (e.g. W ̈achtersh ̈auser,1990; Morowitzet al., 2000) consider genetic function as a later evolutionary achievement of a lifethat began as autocatalytic-metabolic cycles. A third prejudice is propounded bythe “compartmentalists,” (e.g. Morowitzet al., 1988) who emphasize the fact thatall life on earth is cellular, and therefore autocatalytic systems were not alive untilthey operated in cellular compartments."},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"16 Creating a perspective for comparing363The literature concerning the problem of life’s origin is littered with specula-tions. What is badly needed, if our scientific approach to this problem is to evolve,is experimental research that will create a platform of relevant new facts, facts thatreflect the whole range of chemical possibilities. Not only is there no harm in lettingsuch research proceed in the different directions that reflect the whole spectrum ofexisting (hopefully potentially transient) preconceptions, but this plurality is abso-lutely required at this stage of our ignorance. The overall strategy for continuingthe search for the chemistry of life’s origin is to conceive or discover, and above allexperimentally explore, any structural and functional type of system that expresseselements of chemical matter’s potential for self-organization.The harvest expectedto result from concerted efforts of devoted geneticists, metabolists, and compart-mentalists, each exploring their own molecular space of structural and functionaldiversity, may reveal to us which of these approaches (or perhaps alternatives, thusfar unrecognized) deserves our ultimate focus.In this concert of efforts, one of the geneticist’s tasks is to extend comparativestudies of potentially natural nucleic-acid alternatives into explorations of infor-mational oligomers that are of a broader structural variety than merely alternativeoligonucleotide systems taken from RNA’s structural neighborhood. Informationaloligomers with polyamide backbones are already known (Nielsen,1993). From thechemical point of view, systems of lesser generational complexity can be envisagedand, among them, systems that contain nucleobases different from the canonicalones. In contrast to the strategy followed so far, a structurally unconstrained searchfor informational oligomers opens up such broad possibilities that it cannot remainsystematic; yet the major criterion for selecting a given system for study, the poten-tial for constitutional self-assembly, will remain the same. What we need is a map,based on experimental facts, of all structure types of molecular or supramolecularsystems that could be relevant to the geneticist’s “dream of a primordial replicator.”A comprehensive search pursued at the chemical level not only geneticists, butalso by metabolists and compartmentalists, may eventually open up the centralbottleneck to making progress in the origin-of-life field – namely, our uncertaintyabout the contingent geochemical boundary conditions of biogenesis. Assessingthe requisites of an entirelibraryof chemically validated candidate systems andjuxtaposing it with alibraryof geologically and geochemically “allowed” boundaryconditions might uncover coincidences that, in the best case, might allow us topinpoint a specific pair of “system type” and “boundary-condition type” whileexcluding other combinations.Astrategy requiring so much effort and based on so many “ifs” may appeardiscouraging. Yet we should view it in light of the dimension of the problem, onethat is perhaps best reflected in the oft-heard statement (with which, in principle,we all may be inclined to agree): “The origin of life, an event of billions of years"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"364Albert Eschenmoserago, is unknowable.” Yet this statement too is a preconception. Given that, in astrict sense, the origin of life may be not knowable, its type of chemistry must bereconstructable and experimentally exemplifiable.In the introduction to this chapter, I pointed to the role of chemical synthesis as theorganic chemist’s major tool for understanding the molecular world. This statementspecifically holds also for the organic chemist’s participation in the search for thechemistry of life’s origin. As organic chemistry as a whole has evolved through thestudy of molecules occurring in nature combined with the creation of moleculesthat have not existed before, the search for life’s origin will be accompanied by anexperimental search for self-organizational behavior inartificialchemical systemsand, eventually, the synthesis of artificial chemical life. This research will be freeof constraints such as potential naturalness and compatibility with geochemicalboundary conditions, unburdened by the demands of having to refer to the past. Thechallenge of moving through design-induced discoveries towards a goal of suchrelevance will, when the time is ripe, attract mainstream chemists in larger numbers.It may indeed turn out that the most promising path toward a comprehension of theconundrum of life’s origin consists in concerted efforts, launched by chemists, tocreate artificial chemical life forms.ReferencesChaput, J.

In large measure, this hasbeen a result of radioastronomical observations. Among the most important is thatthe majority of the radiation of the universe is almost uniform and follows thespectral distribution of a thermal source at a temperature of 2.725 K.1This cosmicbackground radiation is the remnant of the initial event, the Big Bang. Althoughthis radiation is essentially uniformly distributed in the universe,2the distributionof matter is highly non-uniform.Matter, 99% hydrogen and helium, is found virtually entirely within galaxies.Galaxies occupy 10−7of the volume of the universe, but contain most of the knownmatter. The origin of this separation of radiation and matter is a topic of much currentstudy, as is the question of galaxy formation and the abundance and distributionof intergalactic matter. Although they are clearly fundamental to the question ofthe chemistry that occurs, it is not my intent or capability to discuss these mostinteresting questions (see Peebles,1993). The heterogeneous distributions of matteroccur universally. Theaveragedensity within galaxies is 1 atom of hydrogen cm3,whereas outside of galaxies estimates are of less than 1 atom of hydrogen m3inintergalactic regions. This sharp aggregation of matter means that the chemistry isoccurring within galaxies. It is sensible to focus the discussion, therefore, primarilyon the molecular abundances and the chemistry occurring in our galaxy, the MilkyWay,because observations are much easier in view of the decrease of radiationintensity as the inverse square of the distance. Thus, most of the observationsdiscussed here are of this galaxy.

A list is given in Table17.1.It is customary to regard chemistry and chemical processes in a utilitarian manner.Thus, the usual natural chemistry is one that occurs at the earth’s surface, frequentlyin aqueous solution. We may further note, as seen in Table17.2below, that thecosmic abundance of the elements is strikingly different from the composition ofthe earth’s crust. This difference is not simply reflected by that of hydrogen andhelium. Of particular interest is the abundance ratio of carbon and oxygen, whichis 1/2.3 cosmically and 1/250 terrestrially. (If carbon is the stuff of life, it wouldappear that the earth is not the optimal location for it.)The techniques of analytical chemistry developed to quantitatively follow themolecular transformations that occur have evolved and have been refined overtwo and a quarter centuries following Lavoisier (Cobb,2002). This natural chem-istry is further aided by the vast body of empirical data built up during thisperiod, which allows relatively facile interpolation or small extrapolation forthe prediction of new molecular transformations. The jump to encompassingthe chemistry of the universe is large. The techniques for thein situanaly-sis of molecular abundances are essentially those of remote sensing, in partic-ular spectroscopy. Seeing in absorption provides the ability to determine bothspecies and their amount. It requires a light source, generally a star, locatedbeyond the region examined. The requirement for absorption, that the temper-ature of the light source be greater than that of the absorber, is generally metwith ease. The requirement that light pass through the sample is frequently notmet. The absorption law isI(ν)/I0(ν)∝exp[−κ(ν)n], whereI(ν)/I0(ν)isthefraction of transmitted light intensity at the frequencyν,κ(ν)isthe absorp-tion coefficient, andnis the column density (units cm2). Whenκ(ν)n≥4,the absorber is essentially opaque (at the frequencyν), making discrimination ofcolumn density, or sometimes even species, not possible.Absorption spectroscopy in the visible and near-ultraviolet region of the spectrumdominated molecular astronomy in the three decades from 1937 to 1968. The speciesCH, CH+, and CN, observed by using bright hot stars as light sources, were seenin the spectra of many stars. The spectra of these species, as shown in Figure17.1, establish that the population in the quantum levels is strongly biased towardthe lowest levels. The population distributions are fit by a temperature of 2.73 K(Bortolotet al., 1969).3This temperature is that of the cosmic background radiation.1The species havereasonably large electric dipole moments; for CH and CN, measurement gives3The very low rotational temperature of interstellar species was pointed out by McKellar (1942).

Thus, thelow internal molecular temperature of the dipolar species established a low densityfor the interstellar translucent (diffuse) clouds. This low density couples well witha picture of atomic dominance in the interstellar medium.The elemental composition of the universe, the cosmic abundance of the ele-ments, is essentially 99% hydrogen and helium. The question of whether a regionis atomic or molecular essentially reflects the condition of hydrogen. Amongthe most significant discoveries or inventions was the detection of the hyperfinetransition of atomic hydrogen in 1951 at 1420 MHz (Ewen and Purcell,1951).6This radio emission provided the tool for seeing cold hydrogen throughout the4Phelps and Dalby,1966: CH,μ=1.46 D; Thompson and Dalby,1968: CN,μ=1.45 D.5Green,1974:CH+,μ=1.70 D.6These transitions were predicted by H.

The excitation of thishyperfine transition by collision at a rate faster than its radiative lifetime occurseven in regions of very low density. The picture of the universe as consisting of thehighly visible stars at high densities together with a cold, low-density, essentiallyatomic interstellar medium fitted observations well.An abrupt change in our picture of the universe occurred in 1968 with the detec-tion of radio emissions from the inversion spectrum of ammonia in the directiontoward the galactic center (Cheunget al., 1968). Because ammonia has a largedipole moment, its rotation–inversion energy levels would be coupled to the back-ground radiation field at low density. Thus, specific sharp line emissions could notobservably occur. The discovery of high-density regions, where hydrogen is molec-ular and a number of molecules emit their characteristic radio frequencies, producedthe present picture of the molecular universe (Ranket al., 1971). It was noted that,in regions of the galaxy where considerable optical obscuration occurred, emission"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"17 Fine-tuning and interstellar chemistry371of the characteristic 1420 MHz of atomic hydrogen was weak or absent. Theseregions of the galaxy have become increasingly important.7Observing the molecular universe by radioastronomy offers numerous advan-tages. The low energies of transitions between rotational molecular energy levelsallow relatively cool regions to exhibit thermal emission. The scattering of radiationby particles varies asν4,sothat regions opaque in the visible are quite transparent atcentimeter and even submillimeter wavelengths. This provides the means of look-ing into the dense, visibly opaque molecular clouds. Finally, rotational transitionsare theoretically the simplest molecular spectra to analyze. The spectra of semirigidspecies may be fitted reasonably well with three constants, the principal momentsof inertia of the species (Townes and Schawlow,1975).Furthermore, these three constants may even be estimated, for species for whichlaboratory spectra do not exist, from the existing body of knowledge on molecularstructure. An early example of this is shown in the story of Xogen, or HCO+.This species was observed by a transition at 89.190 GHz (Buhl and Snyder,1970),which did not correspond to any known laboratory spectrum; hence, it was namedXogen. The very high spectral resolution of radio-frequency spectroscopy showedno hyperfine splitting, ruling out the possibility that Xogen was either a radical or aspecies that contained nitrogen. The spectral transition fitted well what was expectedfor the lowest transition of HCO+(Klemperer,1970), a species isoelectronic tothe well-studied and already observed molecule HCN. The species HCO+is thedominant ion in dense molecular clouds. The proof that Xogen is HCO+wasdemonstrated by its laboratory spectrum (Woodset al., 1975).Radioastronomy has established the molecular character of large, important por-tions of the universe. Hydrogen is, of course, the most abundant molecule. Followingit in abundance is carbon monoxide. The facile mapping of matter by observingmolecular hydrogen is virtually impossible. The low-energy pure quadrupole rota-tional transitions are highly forbidden, as well as relatively high in energy, withthe first transition,J=2–J=0, occurring at 360 cm−1.Inaddition, they occurat inconveniently high frequencies detectable in the far-infrared range and requiresatellite observatories. The high energy of the lowest excited emitting level,J=2,then requires a heated source. For typical molecular clouds at a temperature of 20 K,the emission would be essentially negligible. It is noteworthy that the vibra-tional transition of H2is observed in strongly heated spatial regions. This tran-sition, occurring in an atmospherically transparent region, around 4500 cm−1, hasbeen well studied in hot regions of the Orion molecular cloud (Gautieret al.,1976).7Anexcellentdescriptionofthisdiscoveryisavailableatthe IEEE History Center: http://ieee.org/web/aboutus/historycenter/oralhistory/ohshz.html; Charles H.

Reprintedwith permission.The observation of molecular hydrogen by means of its electronic transitionsin a sense follows classical optical interstellar spectroscopy. It is, however, con-siderably more complex, requiring essentially controlled satellite observatories.Thus, it serves to determine molecular-hydrogen column densities in translucentclouds, but cannot provide images of the dense molecular clouds. For these, carbonmonoxide is the generally accepted tool. The reported results are in terms of H2column densities under the assumption that the H2:COratio is the accepted valueof 104.COisobservable by means of its many isotopomers. This is extremelyuseful, as the common isotopomer12C16Oisfrequently optically opaque, makingits emission intensity independent of column density. The much less abundant iso-topic forms13C16O,12C18O, and even13C18Oare then used for producing mapsof molecular abundance. A final important virtue of carbon monoxide for produc-ing radio-frequency images is its very small electric dipole moment of 0.1098 D(Muenter,1975). This ensures the weak coupling of the CO rotational transitions tothe microwave cosmic background radiation field, permitting the collisional exci-tation of rotational transitions in relatively low-density regions, and thus their map-ping.

This high quality factor allows very accurate species identificationin comparison with laboratory spectroscopy. The polyatomic molecules attract thegreatest chemical and biological interest, although in amount it is the diatomicspecies H2that is preponderant. The present largest positively identified molecularspecies, HC10CN, contains 12 heavy atoms. These species are listed in Table17.1.8An enjoyable reference to the discoveries of molecular astronomy is also available.9An abridged list of the cosmic abundance of the elements and the contrast to theearth’s crust is presented in Table17.2.The majority of the observed polyatomic species contain carbon. Because theratio of hydrogen to carbon in the universe is 3×103, the nature of the chemistry, orbetter chemical processes, leading to this preference for organic polyatomic speciesin the interstellar medium can be examined for sensitivity – or, in effect, fine-tuning.Is this a chance development or a predictable consequence of the electron structureof matter? We can further ask, in view of the abundance of hydrogen, why among theobserved organic species there is such a preponderance of unsaturated compounds.The galaxy is clearly not uniform in atomic density. The average density is2×10−24gcm−3or 1 atom cm−3. This rich chemistry primarily occurs in thedense molecular clouds. In developing a scheme for the formation of the specieslisted in Table17.1above, the standard method would be to first simply followequilibrium arguments. The observed species in Table17.1show clearly that equi-librium thermodynamic constraints are inappropriate, because in some instanceshigh-energy isomeric forms of species are quite abundant. Note that both HCN andits high-energy isomer HNC are observed. The observed relative abundance[HNC][HCN]is near unity in cold molecular clouds. Using the canonical temperature of 20 K,the equilibrium abundance ratio[HNC][HCN]predicted is 10–250. Further evidence againstusing an equilibrium model for the prediction of the chemistry and molecular abun-dances is found by considering the reactionCO+3H2=CH4+H2O.(17.1)At 20 K, the equilibrium constant,K=[CH4][H2O][CO][H2]3,isreadily calculated from stan-dard enthalpies to be 10490molecules−2cm6.For[H2]=105cm−3,avalue typicalof the molecular clouds, the predicted ratio of CO/CH4is 10−500. Because CO isthe second most abundant molecule, this rules out arguments of chemical equilib-rium, which disagree with observation by 500 orders of magnitude, for the usefulprediction of the observed molecular abundances.8The sites www.ph1.uni-koeln.de/vorhersagen/ and www.cv.nrao.edu/ ̃awootten/allmols.html are current sourcesfor observed interstellar molecules.9See www.molres.org/astrochymist/astrochymistism.html."},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"374William KlempererFigure 17.3.

The beautiful Horsehead nebula in Orion, a rich molecularregion, is shown in Figure17.3; the molecular cloud Barnard 68 is shown in Figure17.4.10The clouds have high optical opacity, and thus starlight will not deeply penetrate.The initiating energy input step of the reaction scheme is volume ionization by high-energy cosmic rays (E≥100 Mev).

H+3reacts with CO, the second most abundant molecule, formingHCO+, which, being the most abundant ion, is readily observed. H+3is observedby its vibrational spectrum, now in many sources (see, for example, McCallet al.,1999).The highly exoergic reactionHe++H2=reaction products(17.5)essentially does not occur at low temperatures, with limits of less than 10−5percollision.

The pro-duction of C+by the route indicated (17.6) is at least 500 times (the ratio of He/Ccosmic abundance) more efficient than direct cosmic-ray ionization of CO, the pre-dominant interstellar carbon source – hence, the rich organic chemistry observedin the interstellar medium. The efficient production of C+has as origin the lack of"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"376William Klempererreactivity of He+with H2. The rich organic chemistry is a direct consequence ofhelium (ion) chemistry.In now examining fine-tuning of the universe, we may examine why the rateof (17.5) is so slow. This reaction was discussed in detail by Mahan (1975), whopointed out that the equivalent reaction with argon – Ar++H2=ArH++H(and other products) – is fast proceeding at the Langevin rate as expected forion–molecule reactions. Thus, the answer to the question of whether it is possibleto change the fundamental constants of the electron so that the He energy levelsresemble those of argon appears to be no.The synthesis of organic molecules by means of carbon ions can be considered.A relatively long series of essentially bimolecular reactions are suggested, as listedbelow. Energetics and rate constants for the species and processes listed are available(Le Teuffet al., 2000). Listed below are some of the reactions in the chain leadingto the formation of C3Hnwheren=1 and 2. The efficiency of the synthesis dependson the ease of production of C+in the dense molecular clouds. The slow radiativeassociation rate of C+with H2starts the chain of reactions:C++H2=CH+2+hν(slow radiative association)(17.7)C+H+3=CH++H2;CH+2+H(17.8)CH++H2=CH+2+H(17.9)CH+2+H2=CH+3+H(17.10)CH+3+H2=CH+5+hν(radiative association)(17.11)CH+5+CO=CH4(√)+HCO+(17.12)CH4+C+=C2H+2+H2(17.16a)=C2H+3+H(17.16b)C2H+2+e=C2H(√)+H(17.17)C2H+3+e=C2H+H2(17.18a)=C2H2(√)+H(17.18b)C2H2+C+=C3H++H(17.19)C3H++H2=C3H+3+hν(radiative association)(17.20)C3H+3+e=C3H2cyclic(√)+H(17.21a)=C3H2linear(√)+H(17.21b)=C3Hcyclic(√)+H2(17.22a)=C3H linear(√)+H2(17.22b)The species labeled (√)have been observed in interstellar molecular clouds.

The deuterated species C3H2D+will have an observable radio spectrum,because the center of charge does not coincide with the center of mass. Althoughthe cosmic abundance of deuterium is only 10−5that of hydrogen, a very high degreeof isotopic enrichment is observed in the cold molecular clouds. It is thus highlylikely that the rotational spectrum of this important, but as yet not detected, reactionintermediate will soon be produced in the laboratory, allowing radioastronomicalsearches.In this reaction scheme, CH4is produced by two steps of radiative associationwith slow rate constants. Because the destruction of C+by electron capture (radia-tive) is four orders of magnitude slower than the destruction of a molecular ionby dissociative recombination, there is not a rapid loss of C+, allowing productionof a saturated hydrocarbon. We recall that chemical equilibrium arguments predictpreponderant conversion of carbon monoxide to methane and water. There is littleevidence for this, as stated earlier. The gas-phase production of CH4from CO andH2then proceeds by a very high-energy kinetic path, namely He++CO=C++O. The production of organic hydrocarbons in this model then depends on carbonion insertion reactions. A number of these have been measured in the laboratoryand have been shown to proceed at essentially collision frequency. The productionof C3hydrocarbons starting with C+is delineated in the set of reactions 17.7–17.22listed above.A natural question is whether this epoch is unique with respect to the rich organicchemistry observed. At first sight, based on the above discussions, this is primarilya question of the abundance of helium and carbon. Without detailed examination,it appears that the production of C+from CO – or, for that matter, from othercarbon-containing species – will occur for a wide range of He and C interstellarabundances. This is probably an oversimplification. The ion–molecule chain ofreactions suggested would be significantly interrupted by reaction with gas-phaseoxygen (in the form of H2O, CO2,O2,orprobably even O). The present cosmicabundance ratio of O/C is 2.3. With gas-phase carbon held essentially in the carbonmonoxide repository, the excess of oxygen is large and, if present in the gas phase,would disrupt the growth of carbon chains. The quickest remedy to this disruption ofthe synthesis scheme is to bind the oxygen into non-volatile substances, essentiallyrefractory oxides (Scappiniet al., 2003).11The chemical nature of the presumed condensed-phase repository is discussedlater. We first examine measurements of abundances of the species H2O, O2, andCO2. Recent observations of H2Oincold molecular clouds from the Submillimeter11See isowww.estec.esa.nl/science/ for many infrared spectra of the interstellar medium.

At this level, it does not interfere with organic synthesis. With elementalevolution, an increase of the O/C ratio is expected. If this is not readily incorporatedinto the refractory solid phase, production of organic species in the interstellarmolecular clouds could well be reduced. CO is an abundant molecule in stronglyred shifted quasars (Downes and Solomon,2003)(z=2.6–6.4). Thus, it would beexpected that its reaction products also are present, but harder to observe. SWAS isinstrumented to measure O2abundances and has not observed any. (O2, althoughlacking an electric dipole moment, has magnetic dipole transitions.) Note that ithas probably not been observed in dense molecular clouds.12The power of ion–molecule chemistry can be further illustrated by showing thedetection of non-polar species by radio observations. The non-polar species N2,isoelectronic and quite similar to CO, is readily observed by its polar protonatedform HN+2(Turner,1974; Greenet al., 1974). The reaction forming this speciesN2+H+3=HN+2+H2is identical to that forming HCO+.HN+2is an abundantmolecular ion detected in many regions of the galaxy, as well as in other galax-ies (Solomonet al., 1992). It provides a means of estimating the abundance of itsnon-polar parent N2, which is the dominant form of nitrogen in molecular clouds.In a similar manner, CO2abundance also may be determined by observing its pro-tonated form HCO+2(Thaddeuset al., 1981). CO2is a potential repository of theexcess oxygen. Thus, directly determining it in cold molecular clouds is of consid-erable importance. HCO+2is formed by the reaction H+3+CO2=HCO+2+H2.The reactions of both HCO+2and HN+2with CO are exothermic and fast. In densemolecular clouds, H+3is primarily destroyed by CO, as HN+2and HCO+2will be. Thevery low observed abundance of HCO+2in dense cold molecular clouds establishesthat gas-phase CO2is not an important repository for excess oxygen.Finally, the question of atomic oxygen’s being the dominant oxygen species indense cold molecular clouds can be examined. This would effectively require aratio O/CO≥1.

The majorelements that will serve as suggested refractory repositories for the excess oxygencan be extracted from Table17.3.Note that these standard substances are adequate to effectively remove the excessoxygen. Sulfuric acid is included as a refractory substance. It has not been observedas a gas-phase species, but might be observed in infrared spectra of clouds. It islikely that most of the chemistry forming these species occurs in hot, dense stellarenvelopes during their mass loss.The chemistry in strongly heated regions changes appreciably (Walmsley,1993).Table17.4shows the dramatic effect of heating in Orion. The strong reduction ofHCO+shows the likely proton transfer to H2O, forming H3O+.Water vapor is abundant in the heated region of Orion. Of particular interest is thethree orders of magnitude increase of H2SinOrion’s hot core. This is most likely theresult of the reaction of H2SO4with hot atomic hydrogen. Finally, the large increasein HCN relative to HNC is plausibly accounted for by the exothermic reactionHNC+H=HCN+H. The essential equality in abundance of HNC and HCN incold molecular clouds is the consequence of the dissociative electron attachmentprocess forming both, HCNH++e. The HCNH+ion is an observed interstellarspecies. That in the strongly heated Orion core the high-energy isomer, HNC,decreases relative to the ordinary stable form HCN shows that the thermodynamicarguments of LeChatelier’s principle are not applicable in a strongly kineticallydetermined chemistry. It appears likely that the converting reaction is the exothermictransformation HNC+H=HCN+H.

Becausethe ions are ultimately destroyed by their very fast dissociative recombination withelectrons, this leads to an ion abundance varying as the square root of the ionizingflux, which is taken to mean a highly stable system. Although the abundance ofa specific ion will show variations depending on cloud conditions, the total ionabundance in dense molecular clouds should be 10−5[H2]1/2.The picture of a gas-phase chemistry in the dense molecular clouds, initiated bycosmic ray ionization of H2and He, has been greatly strengthened by the directobservation of the very early reactant H+3(Oka,1992). The identification and deter-mination of the spectrum of H+have been a great triumph of laboratory studies(Oka,1980). This ion is now observed in absorption in many sources by means of itsvibrational spectrum (McCallet al., 1998), as well as in planetary atmospheres inemission (Oka,1992). Its abundance allows critical exploration of ionizing fluxes,primarily cosmic rays, and further provides an exceptional sight into dense molec-ular clouds.Perhaps the most dramatic consequence of removing CO from the gas phaseby freezing of the dust grains in very cold prestellar regions is the observationof extremely enhanced deuterium abundances in molecules.

MorowitzLearning from our own existenceHoyle’s [1] successful prediction of the 7.6 MeV resonance of the carbon-12nucleus, based on observation of his own carbon-based existence, established thescientific usefulness of anthropic principles. These principles have become com-mon, if not yet standard, tools in cosmology, where theories of initial conditionsmay not yet exist – or, if they do exist, may admit a range of values [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].At the same time, anthropic principles have retained a traditional role in religionand philosophy, where sensitive dependence of human existence on laws of naturethat could imaginably have been otherwise is interpreted as evidence for humansignificance in the creation of the universe.The tendency of life forms to make universal use of, and seemingly to depend on,specific details of natural law or historical circumstance does not end with nuclearabundances. Following decades of studying the ways in which mammalian bloodachieves homeostasis by exploiting favorable regions in carbonic-acid chemistryand similar adaptations, Henderson compiled a list of such dependences in physi-ology [7]. Inverting Darwin’s description of selective fine-tuning of organisms for“fit” to their environments, Henderson characterized his physiological sensitivitiesanthropically as evidence of “the fitness of the environment” for life.The rapid growth in understanding of biology, from structures to systems, seemslikely to expose many more sensitivities of life to details of chemistry, physics, andhistory. The question has been posed as to whether these advance Henderson’s inter-pretation of fine-tuning of the environment or, more generally, what their anthropicsignificance is.

How do we distinguish features that are “essentialto life” from adaptations to convenient environmental circumstances? Are the meaningfulsensitivities properties of abstractions, even from structures we see universally? If so,how do we abstract correctly?2.What are the structure of anthropic arguments and their range of interpretations? Whatother inputs besides universality or sensitivity of life’s processes contribute to assigningmeaning?3.What specific presuppositions create the meanings of “fine-tuning” or Henderson’s“fitness”? How do conclusions of this type depend on whether we study sensitivityof features or relations?Webegin in the following subsections with careful definitions of anthropic argu-ments, fine-tuning, and fitness in terms of the general problem of inferring infor-mation about generative processes by using their output as evidence. We note thatsensitivity in the output is necessary for useful inference, but that it carries differentinformation in complex and simple systems, where it has different frequencies.The wealth of biological evidence available today, together with growing under-standing of self-organization in physics and chemistry, cautions us that we mustincorporate life’s variations with its universals, and its robustness with its sensitiv-ity, at all levels in our analysis. A pragmatic anthropic principle guides us: the ideathat the universals in metabolism, structure, and regulation today allow us to inferthe thermodynamic and chemical forces responsible for life’s emergence.Weargue that much of biological order comes from arrangement and augmen-tation of near order in the underlying chemical world and that the uniqueness oflife is often found in this augmenting relation, rather than in particular biologicalstructures. What seems familiar and lawful to us about life is often the lawful-ness of the underlying physical and chemical world, with which we have broadexperience, as that order is expressed transparently through the living process. Weare seeing the environmentthroughlife; the meaningful category distinctions aredefined not by specific molecular structures, but by specific relations to the opportu-nities for structure formation in chemical and energetic relaxation.

Morowitzthe Neo-Darwinian explanation for emergence and universality, a sort of anthropicnull model.Anthropic principles, fine-tuning, and fitnessLiving systems combine a strictness of regularity with a profusion of innovationof structures, to a degree that seems unequaled in any other single class of phe-nomenon we recognize. They are uniform in many ways, but strikingly diverse inothers. All organisms ever alive on earth, taken together, account for a tiny frac-tion of the conceivable physicochemical structures of comparable complexity, andtheir uniformity implies that, in a statistical sense, the realized instances are drawnover and over (redundantly sampled) from that small subset of possibilities. Thespecification of the actual within the conceivable defines a measure of statisticalinformation in the forms we see. As formalized by Shannon and Weaver [8], infor-mation measures surprise and is defined only when we have specified an ensembleof comparable forms from which the observed forms are drawn [9]. We may hopeto use the variability within observed living systems to identify the ensemble ofpossible process networks from which they are selected, and thus something aboutthe nature of life within the environment.Afewinformative properties of life come from easy category distinctions, suchas the fact that all known life makes essential use of carbon and carbon–oxygen–nitrogen molecules in liquid water solution. The seemingly trivial observation thatsuch “carbaquist” chemistry is ruled out if astrophysical carbon abundance liesbelow a certain threshold enabled Hoyle [1]topredict the 7.6 MeV carbon-12(12C) nuclear resonance with remarkable precision because the discovery of thetriple-alpha reaction synthesis of12Cinstars happens to be a bottleneck for stellarnucleosynthesis of all the heavy elements.1The pragmatic information in this pre-diction is easy to measure because it guided experimental characterization of12Cnuclear structure where the existing computational capabilities could not. Similarsensitive dependence of the physical state of water has been used to define a “hab-itable zone” in planetary physics [10], which is not predictive in the same sense ascarbon abundance (we already knew where the earth’s orbit lies), but which createsa useful filter in the search for extraterrestrial life.The “Anthropic Principle” is the name given to a collection of related argumentsof this type, in which observations about the existence or form of life are used asevidence to constrain theories of the natural laws from which life arises. The dif-ferent forms of the Anthropic Principle are conventionally divided by philosophers1In Appendix 18.1, we explain why a natural measure exists for the precision of this prediction and also themethodological limitations relative to which this natural measure generates a surprising prediction about nuclearstructure."},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"18 Fine-tuning for intermediary metabolism387into “weak” and “strong” [4], according to whether they merely make other conse-quences of the same laws conditional on our existence as observers or predict lawsor parameter values that are believed to be unique in nature, but for which no otherbasis of selection is known.Anthropic reasoning is a subset of the more general reductionist inference ofnatural laws from observations of their effects [11], distinguished by its use oflife as evidence (in some particular cases, human life and thought, as the namesuggests). The program of model validation from posterior evidence is formalizedin a probabilistic construction known as Bayes’ theorem [12]. We show in Appendix18.1 that anthropic principles have a common logical structure of Bayesian updatingand that the distinction between weak and strong principles lies essentially in theprobability interpretation of the prior beliefs.Bayesian formalization makes clear that refinement of prior beliefs with posteriorevidence does not by itself assign meaning to those beliefs. Thus, the same evidencecan be claimed in support of different meanings in different contexts. It can providea pruning rule [11, 13]tosolve an intractable problem, as Hoyle’s prediction did forFowler and Whaling [1], or a way to work around the lack of theoretical specificationof initial conditions, as in some cosmological proposals [4, 5, 6]. These are bothweak anthropic arguments whose distinct meanings are defined within the contextof scientific prediction.In contrast, strong interpretations generally have meanings originating outsidescience, precisely because initial conditions by assumption precede cause and effector the criteria of repeatability that validate causal theories [14]. The concept offine-tuning originates in an anthropomorphic interpretation of the Bayesian priordistribution for such initial conditions. “Tuning” suggests intervention with pur-pose, a presupposition incompatible with the notion of causality in natural law[15], but neither obviously inappropriate nor obviously useful for theories of initialconditions.For Bayesian inference to aid prediction, the posterior observable must dependnon-trivially on the prior variable being estimated. Fine-tuning presumes a naturalmeasure of sensitive dependence, such as a small half-width of nuclear resonancein relation to its center frequency. We will find, however, that the weak anthropicuse of life’s current forms to study its origins requires us to abstract away from themost facile category distinctions of life from non-life. Simple categorizations basedon specific amino or nucleic acids, which may depend sensitively on history as wellas chemistry, can include adaptations that are not restrictive on either the environ-ment or the essential nature of life and ignore its robustness under environmentalfluctuations.Adaptation produces sensitive dependence in living forms quite generallybecause it arises from growth with heritable variations. Differential growth rates"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"388Eric Smith and Harold J. Morowitz(including survival and fecundity effects) appear exponentially with time in thepopulation frequencies of inherited features, leading to sensitive dependence ofpopulation samples of phenotypes on small differences in their relations to envi-ronments [16]. Under situations of resource constraint, this can result in competitiveexclusion, through which not only the population mean, but all of its instances, maybe strongly biased by small differences in viability. The relative growth rates them-selves, which may not depend sensitively on environment by any natural measure,are termed “fitness” in Darwinian population dynamics [17]. Darwinian fitness isexpressed through selection of individuals – each one a relatively complex packageof adaptations – in response to the often complex characteristics of their environ-ment. Therefore, it frequently leads to sensitive dependence of complex wholes oncomplex wholes.Henderson appears to have appealed to this latter aspect of fitness in charac-terizing the laws of chemistry and physics, as well as the earth’s environmentalcomposition, as “fit for life” [7]. The observed physico-chemical environment issensitive to his criterion that it be able to support life’s complexity and also its needfor homeostasis, rather than being the result of any dynamic process that producesexponential dependence on initial conditions, and in that respect is unrelated toDarwinian fitness.Because of its variability, adaptability, and robustness, it seems likely that life willadmit relatively few easy category distinctions, such as the carbaquist sensitivity tocarbon abundance. Most of the “information” in the structure of life, about eitherits necessary circumstances or its generating processes, will likely come from morespecific structures, which typically emerge at higher levels of complexity. Thus, inaddition to understanding the logic of anthropic argument and the flexibility in itsuse of empirical sensitivities, we must understand the different kinds of surprisecarried by sensitivity in complex and simple systems.Sensitivity and antisensitivity in complex systemsLinear or near-linear response is common in simple systems with few degrees offreedom [18], averages of simple systems with few global constraints and central-limit theorem statistics [19], and closed systems near stable equilibria, not driven bypersistent forces in the environment. Systems with intermediate numbers of degreesof freedom and global configurational constraints (such as nuclei or atomic electronshells) tend to display few and isolated sensitive features, such as resonances aboutground states governed by Pauli exclusion. Experience with non-linear dynamicsand chaos has taught us, however, that sensitive dependence on initial conditionsand details of dynamics becomes a generic property of the observables of complexsystems with long-range constraints [20]."},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"18 Fine-tuning for intermediary metabolism389Whereas we might extract information about a generative process from an obvi-ous feature such as a parameter value (frequency of a nuclear resonance) in asystem of moderate complexity, the equivalent capacity to inform us (reduce ouruncertainty) about the generating process may reside only in a category of featuresin a complex system. Which feature we see may depend sensitively on historicalaccidents that are irrelevant to the generating process itself, but only when weunderstand how to see past this contingency – which would affect any realizationof the process – do we identify the informative regularity of the whole category.Convergence, of central empirical importance to the structuralist interpretation ofDarwinian evolution [21, 22], can indicate sensitive selection of organism featuresfor fit to the environment. Yet this sensitivity is not restrictive either of the “alive-ness” of the organism or of the environment, because we recognize convergenceprecisely where there exist diverse solutions matched to diverse environments, aswell as viable pre-convergent starting points that were not so specialized. The tor-pedo shape of fish is a strongly convergent trait selected for swimming at highReynolds number. Yet phytoplankton, which must move and feed in the oppo-site extreme of low Reynolds number, display completely different but similarlyuniversal traits [23, 24].Resilience and robustness can come from the same ability to track the envi-ronment that leads to convergence or from a quite different ability to absorb itsvariations, leading to a kind of antisensitivity. Such antisensitivity is not exclu-sive to life; the atmosphere generates many negative feedbacks that confer stabilityagainst geological and biogenic shocks. Indeed, the pH stability of blood arises fromits positioning at a stable region of carbon dioxide solution chemistry in water. Thefitness of the environment for life may depend on its richness in such stable regions,but not necessarily on the ability of natural selection to exploit those regions.The ability of life to accommodate environmental variation, either through com-plementary adaptation or through compensation, argues against naive characteriza-tion of life in terms of specific biochemical pathways or structures, even universalones. We must first understand why they are universal and what relation to ordistinction from the abiotic environment they exemplify.Accounting for biological universalityCellular life has existed on earth for between 3.8 and 4 billion years [25]. As therewas essentially no molecular oxygen in either the atmosphere or oceans for thefirst two billion years [26, 27], at least the great bulk of life inhabited neutral orreducing environments and appears to have been exclusively prokaryotic. Althoughphotosynthesis is not ruled out during this period, the large-scale photolysis ofwater does seem unlikely, so that the free energy to drive life had to come from"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"390Eric Smith and Harold J. Morowitzgeochemical reductant, abiotically generated organic compounds (of atmospheric orastrophysical origin), or low-energy photosynthesis (involving sulfur or other weakoxidants). Over the interval from 2.4 to 1.6 billion years ago, first the atmosphereand then the oceans gradually became loaded with oxygen, believed to have beengenerated by oxygenic photosynthesis [28] and to have accumulated once buffersagainst oxidation, such as reduced iron in the oceans, were exhausted. Around thesame time, eukaryotes emerged through endosymbiosis. Even today, the largestnumber of major taxa (whether grouped by 16S rRNA phylogeny or other criteriabased on way of life, which more naturally reflects the horizontal gene transferthat continued for other metabolic pathways after ribosomal RNA was effectivelyfixed within lineages [29, 30]), are prokaryotes [31], and all intermediary metabolicpathways are used within this group.Prokaryotic life is found over a temperature range exceeding 0–100◦C,apHrange of 1–10 or more, a NaCl concentration ranging from 0.01 M to saturation,and an oxygen saturation ranging from 0 to 20%. In laboratory settings, cells haveremained viable under deuteration of from ambient 0.001 to 0.99 of the solventwater and under replacement of water with 0–35% glycerol. Prokaryotes occupyall environments on earth that harbor life and define the limits of its robustness andmetabolic adaptability as far as we know.Throughout this remarkable range of conditions, all known life shares a com-mon chart of intermediary metabolism. In reducing autotrophs, energy is derivedfrom environmental redox couples by either the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA)cycle, the reductive acetyl-CoA cycle, or the Calvin–Benson cycle, and all biomassis synthesized from carbon dioxide, water, ammonia, and simple inorganic saltsand acids, or from more reduced inorganic chemicals produced from these, such asacetate. In photoautotrophs, reductant produced by photosynthesis either drives ATPformation and biosynthesis directly (as in some purple Archaea such asHalobac-terium halobium)oriscombined with photosynthetically produced oxygen in oxida-tive TCA (or Krebs)-cycle respiration. Heterotrophs implement subsets of the samemetabolic networks as autotrophs, combining to produce entire networks in ecolo-gies, which are always autotrophic.Heterotrophy is possible because all organisms are composed of roughly thesame 300 small molecules (molecular mass < 500 Dal), into which all food is bro-kendown before being used directly or being reassembled into several thousandkinds of polymer inside the organism. All major classes of these biomolecules aresynthesized from the eleven carboxylic acids of the rTCA or TCA cycle, althoughsugars can also be photosynthesized from 3-phosphoglycerate by an alternate path-way.Adiagram of this universal synthetic core is given in Figure18.1.

Synthesis of categories usuallybegins with a specific molecule (lightface).synthesized from these starting compounds. The porphyrins, an important classof ring molecules that bind transitional metals in cofactors, chromophores, andelectron-transfer proteins, are generated from succinate.All reactions among these metabolites are catalyzed in modern organisms byprotein enzymes or ribozymes, all of whose sequences are encoded in DNA. Yetextensive horizontal transfer of genes in both metabolic [32, 33] and photosynthetic[34] networks has taken place, whereas the metabolites and chromophores areessentially universal. (Some variability exists in chlorophylls, rhodopsins, and someaugmenting pigments [35], possibly because of their relatively high molecular mass,which is not found in the simpler metabolites.)How are we to account for this universality within the remarkable diversity bothof environments and of relative reaction kinetics within organisms? Two interpre-tations exist, one based on an extreme controlling role for gene-encoded catalysisand pure Darwinian selection, and the other based on a continuation from physicalchemistry to core metabolism.Gene as gatekeeper and happy accidents: the anthropic null hypothesisOne of many unique features of modern life, with its great complexity, is the abilityto faithfully pass genetically encoded traits from generation to generation through"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"392Eric Smith and Harold J. Morowitzreproduction. The fidelity of the inheritance mechanism is not perfect; the smallincursion of mutations enables the tracking of lineages of descent [36]. The accuracyof inheritance is remarkably high, however, and traits that are not actively removedby selection can persist indefinitely in large populations, as well as proliferate acrosslineage boundaries by horizontal gene transfer. At the same time, mutation is blindwith respect to future selective advantage, allowing even favorable traits to be lostforever [16].Depending on how much we think of genes as the arbiters of the possible for lifeforms, we choose between two qualitatively different interpretations of universalityand robustness. It is possible that the universal reagents and pathways of interme-diary metabolism are not qualitatively distinct from other organism traits that weobserve as variable or that have not been preserved, such as the number of digitson vertebrate limbs throughout history. The robustness of all these traits preservedthrough evolutionary time could be conferred arbitrarily by the robustness of theinheritance mechanism; indeed, this is more likely for metabolically central featuresthan for peripheral features such as morphology simply because of the number ofother pathways that evolve to depend on them exclusively. A characteristic of theneo-Darwinian commitment to the central dogma – that information flows fromgenes to mRNA to proteins to pathways – is that genes become the gatekeepers bywhich all living functions must be discovered and maintained.Note that this is not a presumption of selective neutrality or pure genetic drift;adaptation and even convergence lie within this paradigm. Rather, it is the moresubtle commitment to “accidentalism,” which is forced on us when we realize thatthe number of combinations of pathways that are in principle consistent with enzy-matic regulation by any large genome far exceeds the number of species (moregenerally, connected gene-swapping populations) that have ever existed. We inter-pose the accident of discovery between the fitness advantages potentially inherentin the environment and any opportunity for selection to find organisms that cap-ture them, and thus we exclude “the arrival of the fittest” [37] from our realm ofprediction. This second-order consequence of neo-Darwinism drastically reducesthe information we are willing to admit from universal biological traits about theirenvironment, because first and foremost we presume that they must have beendiscovered in a common ancestor for any but the most superficial mutations.If our priors – as they are called in the domain of Bayesian inference, for whichsee Appendix 18.1 – admit a very large number of imaginable genetically regulatedmetabolisms (say, a number that scales exponentially with genome size, such asthe number of possible combinations of enzymes), a strict neo-Darwinian viewof metabolic universals becomes almost an anthropic null model, because anyparticular combination has near-zero probability of discovery and is preserved eitherbecause no competitive scheme was ever found by the genome or as a result of its"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"18 Fine-tuning for intermediary metabolism393centrality. Redundant discovery of a single solution is as improbable as multipleindependent original discoveries, and we lock ourselves combinatorially into theinterpretation that modern organisms are tied to primordial organisms primarilythrough descent. Their observed forms are then not permitted to refine the priorprobabilities for the pathways selected at life’s emergence. The only question inthis view is how far back descent enables us to see. Gene-first models of the originof life [38] impose Darwinian selection as a pure paradigm back to the originatingevents, leaving both emergence of the genome and the subsequent innovation ofthe pathways favored by genetic regulation a “happy accidents” [39].Structuralism in evolution [21], the predictable selection among those competingsolutions that do arise, survives on the margins of the domain of accidental discoveryin neo-Darwinism. Practically, it is only a predictive theory (as opposed to a mererationalization) for competition among nearby variants, whose probabilities aresensibly calculable. (This is also why gradualism has been so heavily emphasizedin “theories” of evolution, beginning with Darwin. Even Darwin did not presumethat large changes were impossible; there was simply nothing in the nature ofscientific explanation that he could say about them, a point that has been assigneddeep philosophical significance by Monod [40].) The tremendous complexity anddiversity of the genetic regulators of metabolic pathways appear to fall well outsidethe domain of small variations, leaving the genomic discovery of a metabolism ableto support all living structures so improbable that selective competition cannot beinferred from current forms. (Remember that the probability for the emergence ofat least one meaningfully independent competitor is presumed to equal the jointprobability for at least two independent originating events for life.) Although nological objection exists to Bayesian priors that place the discovery of metabolismoutside the domain of scientific prediction, such priors seem practically at odds withthe assumption that the genome somehow found a metabolism so productive thatcellular life could emerge within 0.2 billion years after persistent oceans formed,after which that life was so stable that it has survived to the present.The neo-Darwinian commitment to gene as gatekeeper, and with it the unfortu-nate buy-in to accidentalism, appears to be a reaction against teleological interp-retations of progress in evolution [41, 42], 43] and an attempt to rule out suchinterpretations methodologically. Yet the absence of teleology in the dynamicsof mutation and recombination cannot rule out systematic progression, and thatprogression can be predictable if selective bias is visible above sampling bias inpopulation dynamics. Any case of predictable, systematic progression is open tointerpretation as progress by those who choose an endpoint for the sake of thatdefinition. Thus, giving precedence to a particular macromolecule (DNA) – for thesake of its susceptibility to historical accident – doesn’t overcome the true prob-lem of prejudiced interpretation [44], and meanwhile it blinds evolutionary theory"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"394Eric Smith and Harold J. Morowitzneedlessly to the pressures for regularity at all the other levels of life, which maynot be so subject to accident.Seeing the environment through lifeAn alternative interpretation is that at least some of the empirically universal featuresof lifearequalitatively different from variable features, and that their persistence isdriven by forces also recognizable in abiotic ordering. This interpretation includesstructuralism in Darwinian evolution, but locates it within a continuum of progres-sions that give predictable shape to the environment and the life within it. Thegenome is simply another emergent level of structure, neither sufficient to definelife nor capable of precluding or overriding the many other chemical and physicalforces that engender organization or stability at multiple levels. The distinctionbetween biological and abiotic order ceases to be defined with the emergence ofgenes or any other single molecular class and must be sought as a system propertyof the relation among the various molecular functions.This moderated view of the role of the genome allows robustness and resilienceto have energetic and statistical origins, which may affect many levels of structure,from the reaction network of metabolites themselves to the centrality and orderof emergence of catalysts regulating them. It is compatible with extensive lateralgene transfer [45] and with experimental investigations on the origin of the genome[46], which call into question the necessity of DNA and RNA as specific categoryfeatures of life. This view is valid where systematic bias remains visible oversampling bias in population dynamics. Unlike sampling bias, systematic bias actspredictably, both at the emergence of life and during its subsequent evolution. Inthis interpretation, the universality of current forms can constitute evidence for thestrong thermochemical biases on life and may be used anthropically to refine thepossible scenarios for its emergence. The requirements on such an interpretationare that we identify the sources of systematic progression and that we demonstratethat sampling bias is not sufficient to mask these sources.Wethus characterize life as a collection of physical and chemical processes ofenvironmental constituents, augmented by biomolecules that are rare or absent inabiotic environments. Different levels of living structures, depending on their com-plexity, can behave more or less like the common reaction networks in the abioticenvironment. In particular, those involving many reactions of small molecules thatare strongly distinguished by free energies of formation or kinetics of functionalgroups [47, 48] may thoroughly and redundantly sample all allowed reactions withone another (a kinetic generalization of the notion of ergodic sampling in equi-librium statistical mechanics), selecting by familiar statistical means the favoredspecies and pathways. More complex structures such as macromolecules – with"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"18 Fine-tuning for intermediary metabolism395a flatter energy landscape, more kinetically equivalent combinations, and lowerturnover in reactions – are both more susceptible to accident and, as a result, moreeligible to record information within the organism about the environment to whichit must respond [49].Genes, compartments, and catalysts are regulatory structures that must be builtfrom free energy and materials made available by metabolic reactions. The metabo-lites are smaller and simpler than the regulators, more of them are present in theambient environment, and the possible reaction networks among them are moredensely sampled than the possible networks producing complex structures. Thus,the reaction network of core metabolism is expected to be more nearly a bulkchemical process [50] than the combinatorics of either nucleic acid or amino acidpolymers.The sources of systematic progression that once drove the emergence of life andnow determine its stable forms can be the same ones that generate stable order inabiotic statistical systems. Thus, we ask how life could have emerged systematicallyand yet without teleology and how the pathways for emergence may have exploitedthe tendency toward self-organization in certain chemical regimes.Progression away from the abiotic stateAdeep conceptual division separates the notions of evolution in biology andphysics, which we argue is in some respects a historical artifact and should beovercome. From the origin of natural selection as a variation on human selection oftraits by breeding, and the later association of one gene – one trait in the first formalpopulation genetic models, a trait in biology has come to mean either an indepen-dent degree of variation in the genome [51, 52]oranindependent axis of selectionby the environment (and sometimes the conflation of the two). The fine structureof biological evolution is traced through changes in genotype and phenotype (thecollection of traits, by whichever definition).In statistical physics, nothing like the “trait” as a salient degree of freedom isrecognized. Rather, ensembles of configurations, rapidly and chaotically generatedby their own internal dynamics, are assumed to be maximally disordered, subjectto constraints such as ensemble-averaged energy or chemical constitution. Theseaverages are the state variables of the system. They need not correspond to degreesof freedom of the dynamics, but rather are defined as the coarse-grained boundaryconditions through which the average properties of the ensemble interact exclu-sively with those of its environment. Maximal randomness of a statistical ensemblesubject to its environmental constraints corresponds to a condition in which themicroconfigurations that produce those state variables are the most numerous inthe ensemble [53]."},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"396Eric Smith and Harold J. MorowitzSystematic progression in statistical systems is a property of changes in thevalues of the state variables, which need not look anything like the diverse observ-ables available in the rapidly fluctuating, microscopically specified configurations.The direction of progression can have a simple description toward end states thatare stable equilibria or away from initial states that are unstable. The followingobservations indicate that the abiotic state of those environments that harbor lifeis unstable, or at least metastable relative to more probabilistically favored states.The idea that evolution proceeds by punctuated equilibrium, invoked to explain thedearth of intermediate forms in the fossil record compared with persistent stableforms [43], would be predicted if metastability were a common property of ecosys-tems, suggesting a complex landscape in which the initial departure from past statesis easier to predict than the likely futures. (Thus, for example, the nucleation eventthat leads to the first vapor-bubble formation in a volume of superheated wateris easier to understand and model than the turbulent dynamical state [boiling] towhich the system subsequently settles.)All environments that harbor life are stressed by a density of unequilibrated freeenergy. Trapped free energy is necessary to drive biomass away from the Gibbsequilibrium state [54] and exists only if all the processes active in the systemare insufficient to create the equilibrium distribution (equivalently, to ergodicallysample the state space in which the equilibrium distribution is the most disorderedand thus favored by probability.)Environments with stable energetic stresses are frequently divided into nearlydecoupled spatial or compositional subsystems. This is true of quasi-stable energeticredox couples at hydrothermal vents and of the weakly coupled 6000 K spectrumof solar visible light and 300 K terrestrial thermal black body [55]. The separatecomponents may constitute internally near-equilibrium subsystems, defined indi-vidually by simple ensemble constraints.Internally equilibrated subsystems, which act as free energy reservoirs, arealready as random as possible given their boundary conditions, even if they arenot in equilibrium with one another because of some bottleneck. Thus, the onlykinds of perturbation that can arise and be stabilized when they are coupled arethose that make the joint system less constrained than the subsystems originallywere. (This is Boltzmann’s H-theorem [9]: only a less constrained joint system hasa higher maximal entropy than the sum of entropies from the subsystems inde-pendently and can stably adopt a different form.) The flows that relax reservoirconstraints are thermochemical relaxation processes toward the equilibrium statefor the joint ensemble. The processes by which such equilibration takes place are byassumption not reachable within the equilibrium distribution of either subsystem.As the nature of the relaxation phenomenon often depends on aspects of the cross-system coupling that are much more specific than the constraints that define eitherreservoir, they are often correspondingly more complex than the typical processes"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"18 Fine-tuning for intermediary metabolism397in either of the decoupled subsystems. Thus, the reducing bacteria draw energyfrom a large collection of dissimilar environmental redox couples [56, 57]. As anensemble of environments, these may be constrained only by pyrolysis at lava–water interfaces, followed by a partial quench in passing to the cooler environmentof hydrothermal vents. Yet the process for redox relaxation by all organisms istransmembrane transduction to apparently uniquely suited phosphodiester bonds[58], and the mechanisms that have evolved to enable this are quite complex [35].As free energy stress is unstable in the presence of cross-system coupling, some(generally complex) relaxation process must become the short-term steady state.The principle that stabilized relaxation processes arise where they can reduce theimpact of a free energy bottleneck has been likened by Eschenmoser to a dynamicLe Chatelier principle [46].Living processes contribute to thermochemical relaxation, but they are not theonly ones to do so. Many processes in convective weather [59, 60, 61], chemistry[62], and engineered systems [63, 64] are examples of self-organized productionof conduits for the transport of energy and transport or generation of entropy.Progression away from the unstable, unorganized state is frequently exponential[63, 64], giving rise to a physical form of competitive exclusion similar to that seenin Darwinian population dynamics at a higher level of complexity. (Indeed, it isnatural from a physical point of view to regard competition for bulk resources tobuild a metabolic energy-transducing channel as the origin of directional evolutionin biology. Darwinian evolution is distinguished by the non-linearities it injects intothis bulk process, making the genome the unit of inheritance and the individual theunit of selection.)As we expect many biological structures to achieve stability by exploiting sta-tistical stability in the underlying chemical networks, so we expect biological orga-nization to be most likely where it follows dynamically stable thermochemicalrelaxation pathways. Their stability can be driven by the free energy stress theyrelieve, by their use of near-equilibrium chemicals and reaction networks, or bythe redundancy of random relaxation pathways leading to them. Thus, a continu-ation exists from physical self-organization to the energetically predictable biasesto Darwinian fitness.Core metabolism and relaxation...and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.(Ezekiel 1.16, Authorized version)Reducing metabolismWenow examine specific features of core metabolism, and its reductive pathwaysin particular, as augmented relaxation channels for redox stress. We begin with"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"398Eric Smith and Harold J. Morowitzreductive pathways for two reasons. First, in a non-oxidizing environment [26, 27],the only energy sources are abiogenic reductant, photosynthesized reductant, andabiotically produced organics. As primordial heterotrophs would have a very limitedpool from which to draw reagents, and photosynthesis is a difficult mechanism tobuild from nothing, we suppose that the most reliable energy source for the first-half-billion or more years of life was geophysically produced reductant and that theuniversal features to emerge during this time hold the most immediate informationabout origins. Reducing environments such as volcanic trenches, and the metabolicpathways of the organisms that inhabit them, are likely to be the least changed inthe modern world from their primordial forms. Second, the chemical simplicity,network topology, and energetics of the reducing metabolism identify it naturally asa relaxation mechanism in a purely chemically stressed environment. Recognizingthe same relations in photosynthetic life requires going outside chemical free energyand considering much more complex metabolic pathways.Weobserve that biomass lies between the energetic redox couples that consti-tute food in a reducing environment and the most reduced, lowest-energy wastemolecules with the same element compositions. The chemical species characteriz-ing one redox relaxation channel created by chemoautotrophic bacteria (realizedentirely in the single organismHydrogenobacter thermophilus[59,p.254] areshown in Figure18.2,inwhich CO2and H2are inputs and CH4and H2O are out-puts. The eleven acids of the rTCA cycle (oxalosuccinate not shown) lie in a narrowrange of free energy per carbon atom along the pathway of progressive reductionof carbon from CO2to CH4.Weexpect this free energy of formation per carbon tobe characteristic of the more general CHO sector of biomass [65], which as notedforms from these acids by side-reactions from the cycle.The acids of the rTCA cycle are low-energy forms at their respective hydrogenreduction stoichiometries. For instance, formaldehyde has higher free energy offormation per carbon than acetate, which has the same chemical composition astwo formaldehyde molecules. Thus, in any relaxation pathway for full reduction ofCO2, likely intermediate states are the rTCA compounds.Next, we present the reaction sequence of the rTCA cycle in Figure18.3.Weobserve that topologically it is a loop with an external regenerative pathway. Ifwe consider the primary loop the recycling of oxaloacetate, this four-carbon com-pound functions as a network catalyst for the synthesis of CH3COOH + 2H2Ofrom 2CO2+4H2. This synthesis is net exergonic, and acetate is the most reducedrTCA compound in Figure18.2.When the regenerative pathway from acetate to oxaloacetate is included, therTCA cycle develops the possibility of self-production, increasing the density ofcatalytic oxaloacetate molecules and hence the bulk rate of acetate synthesis fromCO2.

In contrast to the abstract simplicity of polymerization, whichoccurs at the price of assuming complex (activated!) inputs, the network catalystsof rTCA are structurally slightly heterogeneous, but act by enhancing condensationof simple molecules into a carrier backbone.

In an enzymatically regulated organism, autocatalysis can be enhancedby speeding the rate of reactions within the cycle. Whether the threshold for auto-catalysis can be reached in a pre-catalytic environment is the subject of ongoinglaboratory experiments. W ̈achtersh ̈auser has suggested, however, that the geometryof surface reactions may be required to reduce the energy barriers of key syntheses[74, 75].Afinal observation about the compounds of the rTCA cycle is that they arerich in carbonyl groups from incompletely reacted CO2.

Enhanced reactivity is favorableboth as a property of a network-catalytic relaxation pathway and for the synthesisof biomolecules that can feed back to enhance the rate of the cycle. We will returnto this latter relation below.Photochemical relaxation by photosynthesisUnlike metabolism in a reducing world, oxidizing metabolism must build biomatterfrom substrates of lower free energy; anabolism and catabolism are opposed. Thus,only in the presence of a non-equilibrium photon spectrum is oxidizing metabolisma relaxation process.Oxidative life, like reductive life, occupies a free energy bottleneck for the samereason that visible light from the sun reaches the surface of the earth, rather than ther-mally equilibrating with matter in the atmosphere. Visible photons couple almostexclusively to electronic transitions in small gas molecules, whereas the terrestrialmicrowave background couples to vibrational and rotational transitions. Quantumselection rules prevent cross-coupling, both of light and of the internal transitions,making the atmosphere an effective barrier to cross-band transduction of lightenergy. Photons absorbed in either band are re-emitted preferentially within thesame band in steady state [55].Inelastic visible photon absorption by larger molecules on exposed mineralsurfaces occurs principally by photodissociation [76]; the resulting relaxation ofexcited vibrational levels of the fragments is partly responsible for the earth’selevated surface temperature. However, photodissociation removes an electronictransition with each absorption, limiting its own rate. Thus, the albedo of the earthis controlled mostly by water, through reflection from clouds (not wavelength-transducing) and absorption in the oceans, the latter of which combines the robust-ness of small molecules with the unusual strong vibrational coupling of molecularclusters in liquid water.The emergence of photosynthetic life is defined chemically by biosynthesis ofthe chromophores, which can absorb visible photons repeatedly. Before it can bere-emitted, the light energy is converted to internal reductant, which is used bycore metabolism, with oxygen (or, in fewer taxa today, other oxidants such assulfur) released to the surroundings [28]. Biosynthesis distributes light energyamong lower-energy chemical bonds, from which it is then dissipated eithermechanically through motion or in vibration and rotation through degradationof biomass. The less than 30% conversion effciency of light to redox potential[77]inchlorophyll-based photosystems (for sugars, under the best of conditions),with the remainder dissipated directly as heat, both makes a pigmentation effect"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"402Eric Smith and Harold J. Morowitzthe major impact of biomass on changing ocean absorption and suggests that themajor technical problem of rapid distribution of vibrational stresses is solved bythese molecules. Additional inefficiencies in the consumption of ATP and reductantin more complex biosynthetic processes also dissipate energy directly as heat insolution.Limitations other than conversion efficiency attest to the difficulty of transducinglight energy abiotically, even in modern chromophores, according to an interpreta-tion by George Wald [78]. Both chlorophylls and rhodopsins absorb away from thefrequency of maximum light intensity at the earth’s surface, the so-called water holeof atmospheric scattering [79]. An absorption band centered in the water hole wouldproduce more free energy for self-reproduction. Yet such a solution has not beenfound even by modern organisms, suggesting that the universal chromophores arelocally optimal solutions to a hard relaxation problem. The smallest self-sustainingmetabolic networks that produce them are equivalent to the networks of the pho-toautotrophs, of considerably greater complexity than the autocatalytic rTCA corefor redox relaxation.The major chemical transitions and robustnessAll of these observations combined lead us to believe that the development ofmodern life as a steady-state relaxation process in fact took place through thesequential emergence of two separate channels. The first in time, and the simple,was the emergence of reductive metabolism through autocatalytic networks eitheridentical or similar to the rTCA cycle. All its reagents are small molecules thatare selected by simple kinetic and physical properties from the complete set ofCHO molecules of comparable size [65], and the reaction networks involving themare relatively densely sampled, either within the cycle or in the side-reactions thatgenerate biomass from it.The reductive metabolic core reactions are close enough to bulk physical chem-istry to be studied with the statistical mechanics of complete reaction networks ofsmall molecules, yet produce the biomass necessary to support the full complementof compartments, catalysts, prosthetic groups, and genes. The scenario requiringminimal happy accidents is one in which most of the complexity of cellular lifedeveloped around this metabolism over the first 0.5–2 Gy.Reductive metabolism captures free energy ultimately produced by the fissionof uranium, thorium, and potassium-40 in the earth’s mantle, but makes no use ofthe richer free energy stress from solar fusion reactions, other than exploiting liquidwater as a solvent in the habitable zone. Photosynthesis captures this independentfusion energy source, but appears to have become accessible only with the molecularcomplexity of modern cells. It therefore evolved to be self-supporting by artificially"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"18 Fine-tuning for intermediary metabolism403generating reductant to synthesize critical components such as the porphyrins frommolecules provided by the rTCA cycle.It is a remarkable example of life’s robustness that the compounds in the rTCAcycle survived the poisoning of the earth’s atmosphere by oxygenic photosynthesisto remain the core of biosynthesis. Photosynthesis of 3-phosphoglycerate as well asreductant enabled the direction of the cycle to be reversed, from self-generation toself-consumption, becoming the oxidative Krebs cycle. In some modern organisms,parts of this cycle are now replaced with other pathways, but the synthetic core hasnot been lost, and the complete cycle is still preserved in some chemoautotrophs.This robustness may be due in part to the centrality of the cycle and the geneticcommitment to complex synthetic networks by the time the transition occurred. Yetthe fact that a plausible primordial form has not been lost suggests to us that itschemical constitution remains a source of selective advantage.At the same time, the oxygen loading of the atmosphere is a useful dem-onstration that mutation, and even short-term selective bias, are not forward-lookingwith respect to slower degrees of freedom, such as the ability of the atmosphere–volcanism cycle to reduce molecular oxygen. Photosynthesis is energeticallyselected even if it produces only reductant, in which case the by-product, oxygen,is a toxin. An additional complex pathway, apparently sharing a common ancestorwith the pathway for nitrogen fixation, is required for photosynthetic production of3-phosphoglycerate, which in turn is required to produce phosphoenolpyruvate tosupport reversal of the rTCA cycle to TCA. Current organisms use the atmosphereas a buffer for oxygen, which is then consumed jointly by photosynthesizers andthe oxidizing heterotrophs. The high O2saturation of this buffer, however, requiresthat these organisms evolve defense mechanisms against oxidizing radicals, as inthe compartment structure of the C4 photosynthesizers [28] and possibly originallyendosymbiosis. Specific enzymes have also evolved for protection from perox-ides, such as catalase for general scavenging of H2O2, and peroxidases for otheralkyl peroxides [35]. Notably, both of these enzymes employ heme as the activegroup.The epistasis represented by persistence of the TCA core in the face of suchendogenous shocks is not easily attributed to any particular attributes of phys-ical chemistry or geology. It is more naturally understood as the Le Chatelier-type stability of a relaxation process in the face of continuous free energy stress.Complex solutions initially present as reductive metabolism, even if they becomeuntenable or marginalized on earth, provide exploratory seeds for generating othercomplex solutions to new problems that arise [70, 71, 72].

MorowitzComplexity hierarchy and feed-down...for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.(Ezekiel 1.20, Authorized Version)Wehave argued that metabolic pathways are statistically favored relaxation chan-nels in energetically stressed environments and that their universality and stabilityresult at least partly from this function. Yet the only places we see these pathwayscapture a significant fraction of element abundances is within organisms. Oncemodern organisms exist, their greater efficiency than abiotic processes can scav-enge useful reagents from the environment, lowering the residual energetic stressbelow the threshold to spontaneously induce life, so the dominance by organisms ofthese relaxation structures may not in itself be surprising [80]. However, the essen-tially regulatory superstructure, which emerges with the complexity of cellular lifeto enhance efficiency, distinguishes living from all non-living relaxation phenom-ena that interact with the same reservoirs by means of the same active chemicalbond types.Phosphates, geometry, and topologyUniversality in these regulatory structures exists beyond that in the metabolic core,which is also likely to be informative at least about the fit of life to energeticallystressed environments. As noted above, all organisms use a variety of redox cou-ples, whether environmentally generated or photosynthesized. Some of these areconsumed for reducing potential directly, such as NADH. Many reactions in cells,however, proceed by dehydrations in aqueous environments, and in all cases thisdifficult reaction is produced by hydrolysis of pyrophosphate [35]. Polymerizationof amino acids, sugars, and nucleotides proceeds in this way, and the only reactionin the rTCA cycle requiring net energy input by an environmental molecule usesATP for dehydration (acetate→pyruvate and succinate→α-ketoglutarate) (seeFigure18.3). Almost all modern organisms store the energetic pyrophosphate bondfor these reactions in ATP, although cases are known where it is stored in crystallinepolyphosphate [81].All pyrophosphate bonds are produced ultimately from redox energy via amembrane-mediated reaction sequence. The sequence first converts redox energy toelectrochemical proton potential, which then drives ATP synthesis. This three-stageprocess involves the interaction of chemically structured energetic transitions (redoxreactions and phosphodiester bond formation) with the spatial motion of protons inpH and voltage gradients.

Membrane interaction with phosphatesmay have originated with the natural proton-semiconducting properties of phos-pholipid bilayers in water [82], and this may have been the first requirement oflife for membranes, as pre-enzymatic rTCA has rate kinetics determined by bulkprocesses [83].This proposal for the first association of membranes with reductive metabolismis consistent with their later use as containers that enhance reaction rates involvingenzymes produced by side reactions from the core cycle. It is a natural sequence forthe cellularization of primordial autotrophs, in contrast with heterotrophic originstories where macromolecules are responsible for the first imprinting of heritablestructure, and in which catalysts first become enclosed in membranes more or lessby accident [84].Wenote that phospholipid bilayer geometry essentially gives spherical topologyas a consequence of physical chemistry [85], so once again life requiring geometryfor energy transduction takes the thermodynamically favored path by being spheri-cal. Yet in the association of variants of metabolism with enclosing vessels, we findthe first forms of individuation. In growth and fissioning by metabolic productionof membrane lipids, we find a crude form of inheritance of variations. Once again,it is not clear at what point these processes, often taken as defining characteristicsof life, become surprising if energy transduction to phosphates has already beeninvoked to bind membranes to metabolism.The requirement for cell walls or some other form of osmotic stabilization issimilarly an almost immediate consequence of containment of any non-ambientmetabolic process. In prokaryotes, it is provided by a universal class of structureswith cross-woven amino acid and amino sugar chains, which are produced inside thecell, moved across the membrane, and assembled on the outside by a sophisticatedprocess of insertion [86]. The more recent device of cholesterol stabilization inconjunction with a tensile cytoskeleton may have emerged to enable endocytosis,and as a result has been amenable to endosymbiosis.Minimal genomesStructures provide physico-chemical regulation of metabolic reactions; catalystsprovide rate-kinetic regulation. Among catalysts, as among structures, an identifi-able functional taxonomy, up to homology, is present.Current prokaryotes have between 480 and 8000 genes, of which core compo-nents define their trophic relations to their environments.Mycoplasma genitalium,a metabolically minimal organism because it depends on the organically richest"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"406Eric Smith and Harold J. Morowitzenvironment, has 480 genes in the wild type and an apparently necessary coreof about 250 in ideal circumstances [87]. Of these, certain invariant groups, suchas 95 genes associated with protein synthesis, are known to have homologs inthe necessary cores of all other organisms whose minimal genomes have beenisolated.In contrast, the smallest genomes known in autotrophs have about 1500 genes. Asthe universal inventory of small molecules numbers about 300, it may be possible foran autotroph to function in ideal circumstances with as few as 750 genes. To identifythe necessary complexity an organism must have in order to sustainably regulatemetabolism in an osmotic container, it is probably necessary to experimentallyisolate such minimal genomes. Because the metabolic load of genes is similarto that of catalysts (they are not consumed in providing templates for enzymesynthesis), the cost of maintaining excess genetic material is much less than thatfor suboptimal metabolic pathways. With the observed frequency of lateral genetransfer, it is therefore expected that most organisms have maintained so-calledextraneous genes, either to enable phenotypic plasticity in fluctuating environmentsor as historical artifacts from ancestors living in different conditions. A functionaltaxonomy of genes thus provides a more reliable input to fine-tuning argumentsthan a purely empirical inventory. It at least enables a separation of those functionsthat are necessary to all organisms under all circumstances, from those that are only“necessary” for robustness or resilience (although this distinction may be only oneof timescale with respect to the problem of persistence through geological time).Regulatory feed-down onto core metabolismAll the regulatory structures we have discussed have at least a qualitative cate-gory distinction from the reagents whose pathways we have argued are most likethose of abiotic chemical networks. To function, all the regulators require polymer-ization of small molecules in the minimal set of 300. Although cell membranesform spontaneously by surface energy minimization, they are only stable withthe addition of either amino-sugar or cellulose cell walls or with the addition ofmembrane-dissolved cholesterol and the cytoskeleton. Amino and nucleic acidsare both generated along short pathways from the TCA core, but to be useful ascatalysts and templates they must be polymerized with particular sequences.A qualitative difference arises between the somewhat sparse but orderly samplingof the reaction network among all small metabolites and the much sparser and moreclearly contingent sampling of the space of synthesized polymers. The reactivityof biomass, a consequence of its reduction stoichiometry as shown in Figure18.2,also induces small free energy differences among different sequences, making the"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"18 Fine-tuning for intermediary metabolism407energetic landscape of sequence space flat compared with that of the metabolitesthemselves.Polymer sequences are therefore much more likely to be governed by samplingbias in evolutionary history than are metabolites [88]. One consequence of thisdegeneracy under permutations of sequence is that neutral models of populationgenetics can provide good first approximations for the evolution of traits that dependon complex syntheses, although this has also reduced most Darwinian arguments torationalizations and led to the complaint that Darwinian evolution is not like otherscientific theories. An important second point, however, is that only such neutralmolecules are eligible, by possessing a degenerate configuration space with manystates, to carry mutual informationwithin the cellabout those characteristics of theenvironment that it needs to anticipate [49]. Although we have argued that it is anerror to identify life with polymer chemistry and sparse sampling, we agree that aqualitative distinction of the informational and regulatory character of life emergeswith this class.The regulatory structures have a universal relation to core metabolism thatappears to be a distinguishing feature of life. First, they are of low metabolicload and can therefore exist in greater diversity than the metabolites they regulate.Thus, a typical cell contains as many as tens of thousands of kinds of polymers,most in small numbers, but only several dozen metabolic reagents, in amounts thatscale with the mass of the organism, and perhaps 50 building blocks, cofactors, andprosthetic groups that are shared among the polymers.Second, whereas core metabolism generates net currents and an arrow of timefrom non-equilibrium thermal boundary conditions, regulatory structures inheritthis arrow of time from metabolism, which generates their building blocks as rawmaterials for combinatorics. Thus, the plausible abstractions for metabolism arebased on microscopically reversible thermodynamics and chemistry, with non-equilibrium boundary conditions. The more natural abstractions for regulatorystructures are cellular automata or the growth-and-culling models of Darwinianpopulation genetics [16]. It is known that important prohibitions on the formationof order, such as the absence of phase transitions in one-dimensional systems, whichapply to near-reversible processes, are not binding for cellular automata because oftheir time-reversal asymmetry and constructive dynamics [89, 90]. The opportuni-ties for encoding stable information are naturally larger in these driven structuresfor dynamical, as well as sampling, reasons.Finally, because regulatory structures usually do not flow between the organ-ism and its environment, and because they act catalytically within the organism,selection of these structures takes place only through their impacts on the rate ofcore metabolism and their ability to efficiently draw energy and material from it"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"408Eric Smith and Harold J. Morowitzfor self-reproduction. (It is implicit here that the fit participation of the organismin itslivingenvironment is almost always a leading factor impacting the net coremetabolism of the ecology as a whole.) Those structures enabling greater bulk freeenergy transduction, more efficient synthesis, or reduced thresholds to autocatal-ysis either survive in expanded environments or exclude less efficient solutions inexisting niches.Wedesignate the reciprocal relation among components, having these threeproperties, as “feed-down” of regulation onto core metabolism. This is a univer-sal relational property of all living systems that provides an energetic foundationfor Darwinian fitness and governs the emergence of complexity and innovation inevolution. Feed-down determines selection bias on catalytic schemata competingintraspecifically to be the surviving metabolic strategies of autotrophs and operatesthrough material cycling, as well as energy capture, at the level of ecologies. Tous, these three relational features of regulators to substrates – sparse sampling thatleads to history dependence, but also to the ability to carry information about theenvironment; a limited gatekeeper role over the forms of organisms; and selec-tion through feed-down reciprocity that operates both prior and subordinate to thegatekeeper role – are more fundamental to life than any single chemical class orphysical structure.Shift in biological anthropic thinkingWehave emphasized relaxation, regulation, and feed-down in this analysis toaccount for the remarkable universality, persistence, and specificity of biochem-ical processes, and at the same time for the robustness and resilience of life asawhole. We expect that many universal pathways depend sensitively on the finestructure of chemistry and that these pathways would no longer be used by life ifthat structure were changed, perhaps even slightly. However, that does not lead usto conclude that some other structures would not arise in their place to fulfill similarfunctions. Thus, we try to avoid the first fallacy in a sensitivity analysis: confusingadaptationtothe environment with singularityofthe environment.The sensitivity of the categories of function we have identified is much morediffcult to estimate than the sensitivity of one or another class of chemical species,both on the structure of chemistry and on geophysical history. Clearly, relaxationrequires non-equilibrium thermal boundary conditions. But what makes a relaxationpathway especially amenable to regulation? Informational structures require a largeconfiguration space with a relatively flat energetic bias and are clearly achieved bythe combinatorics of the reactive CHO and CHON molecules with characteristichydrogen saturation and free energy of formation. But what kind of periodic table,"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"18 Fine-tuning for intermediary metabolism409other than a vacant one, would rule out the existence of any such combinatorialregime anywhere in the space of chemicals?These are the questions required in a sensitivity analysis of the category dis-tinctions we have made. Given the limitations of synthetic and computationalchemistry, even sampling the space of structures permitted by the known periodictable is just becoming imaginable. Sampling the space of structures of counterfac-tual chemistries thoroughly is far beyond our collective current capability. Yet weexpect this kind of sensitivity analysis to be appropriate for anthropic reasoningabout the fitness of the environment from biology, a departure from the methodused in cosmology or astrophysics. In principle, questions about the richness of thelaws of nature in opportunities for biological complexity are answerable, althoughdifficult.This categorization, which makes strong anthropic reasoning diffcult, does per-mit a form of weak anthropic reasoning that we consider very useful. Primordialforms of life were probably different in many respects from all modern formsbecause they were not tuned by four billion years of first chemical, and then Dar-winian, selection; conversely, they were not in competition with any modern organ-ism. They were likely driven by environments with higher energetic stress becausethe relaxation phenomena that operate throughout the globe today did not exist,although we do not envision an environment so rich in free energy and organicraw materials [38]astoenable gene-first emergence. Despite these differences ofdegree, decomposing metabolism into the parts likely to have been governed byinvariant laws of statistics, and those likely to have been limited by sampling andbiased by selection, allows us to reason uniformly about emergence and persis-tence. The experience we gain through attempts to apply weak anthropic reasoningto practical and accessible problems is likely to be our best ladder to a conceptualsystem capable of framing strong anthropic questions.APPENDIX 18.1 ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLES AND THEIRINTERPRETATIONSThe ambiguous role of anthropic biasEven when they make use of quantitatively expressed sensitivities, anthropic argumentshave tended to be discursive rather than formal [1, 5, 6, 7]. The demonstration that someaspect of life depends sensitively on the form of a natural law or value of an initialcondition may seem surprising enough to set a course of research, and can thus be usefulwithout formalization. Hoyle’s argument for the 7.6 MeV resonance of12C set anexperimental agenda for Fowler and Whaling [91] without the logical grounds’ needing tobe specified for surprise at the abundance of astrophysical carbon.However, sensitivity of observables to inputs, by itself, carries neither surprise normeaning, and the same demonstration of sensitivity can be an input to anthropic"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"410Eric Smith and Harold J. Morowitzarguments with a range of meanings. We show in this appendix how the same sensitivityof carbon abundance to nuclear structure can be used in anthropic principles with threedistinct interpretations.First, it can generate a pruning rule [11, 13]tosimplify a combinatorially intractable,but scientifically conventional, problem. This is the minimal, pragmatic interpretationgenerated by the experimental problem of nuclear characterization. The observation ofastrophysical carbon abundance was a proxy for the detailed and untenable (in 1954)calculation to predict nuclear structure from the masses and scattering cross-sections ofelementary particles. Since such a calculation was, in principle, possible fromindependently measured values, the anthropic prediction of a 7.6 MeV resonance wasfalsifiable theoretically as well as experimentally, or alternatively could act as a constrainton less certain inputs to the constructive calculation. Second, in cosmological scenariosthat admit a range of values for either matter densities or the parameters in the standardmodel [4, 5, 6], anthropic reasoning can act as a filter for the set of all observations wewill ever be able to make. In this capacity, predictions for the distribution of initial valuesare not falsifiable by assumption. The Anthropic Principle is not an input to reductionistinference, either of the existence of universes with other parameters or of the theorypredicting them.Although different, both interpretations are categorized as weak anthropic principleswhose meaning is defined by the refinement they make in the predictions of observables.Informationally [8], the surprise in an anthropic prediction is measured relative to therefinement of the same prediction without the condition of our existence.The prediction of cosmological initial conditions is a different business, however, fromthe validation of causal theories. Initial conditions by assumption have no cause that canbe varied to check their dependence, and the cosmos is by assumption a single instance ofthese values, which we cannot compare experimentally to anything else to test forrepeatability. Weak anthropic principles are a conservative response to this dilemma, inwhich the issue of boundary conditions is put off to a larger theory determining adistribution of pseudo-initial conditions for the universe we see [2, 3]. A radical responseis to propose that only one universe exists and to make predictions for its initial conditionson some criterion other than causality, such as a form of mathematical consistency[92].Strong anthropic principles provide alternative criteria to mathematical consistency forthe declaration of initial conditions: whatever selects them does so for consistency withour later existence. Pragmatically, there is no difference between the predictions made bystrong and weak anthropic principles, so the philosophical difference attached to theirinterpretation must come from outside scientific epistemology. The informativeness orsurprise in the strong anthropic condition must similarly be measured with respect to someother source of uncertainty, since it is not compared with the predictive specificity ofcausal theory. Some strong interpretation, in which human existence has significance forthe selection of cosmological initial conditions, seems to have been favored by Hoyle andWickramasinghe [93] and obliquely by Henderson [7].Bayesian structure of anthropic reasoningThe common element that separates anthropic argument from constructive logic is the useof posterior observations (specifically, involving the existence of human or other life) toinfer boundary conditions that from the perspective of construction would be regarded asprior knowledge. Such inputs to constructive logic are conventionally referred to as"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"18 Fine-tuning for intermediary metabolism411“priors.” Bayesian inference [12] nicely captures the logical role of anthropic bias, whileremaining general enough to admit the range of interpretations we have described.Formally, Bayes’s theorem relates posterior to prior probabilities for observables from astochastic process with well-defined joint probabilities. If the conditional probabilitiesthat appear in it are interpreted as the index functions of constructive logical arguments,however, the posterior probability can be interpreted as the likelihood of a generativemodel, given the data. Such an interpretation makes explicit the ontological commitmentsthat have been made by the modeler in the form of Bayesian priors. The importantconclusion of such probabilistic representations of theory building is that non-trivialinputs always remain unjustified by the data used. The differences in anthropicinterpretation hinge on where these inputs originate.Forvery simple problems of machine learning and pattern discovery, Bayesianinference provides practical, quantitative measures of the relative likelihood of models[94]. Obviously, any Bayesian representation of human theory building in nuclear physics,cosmology, or biochemistry (much less theology) is at best a cartoon, a sort ofpseudo-code to capture the logical structure of the actual process whose implementationwe do not nearly understand. None the less, it is not ridiculous to write down, if oneremembers that the purpose of scientific statements is to guide behavior by offering somerationale for betting. A formal representation of anthropic argument that captures thechange in rational behavior generated by the posterior observation can be valid withoutpresuming any description of beliefs.Wetherefore formalize Hoyle’s prediction as an example, first in the minimal form of apruning rule, and then extended to the conservative and radical cosmological forms. Weidentify the source of predictive specificity in anthropic argument and separate from thatthe source of interpretation of the priors in different applications.The minimal Bayesian structure of Hoyle’s proposalSuppose nuclear physics offers a denumerable set of rules that we can denote byN,inprinciple sufficient to predict the states and transitions of all the chemical elements. Thisset may be well approximated by a few particle masses and quantum numbers, andS-matrices for the interactions of nucleons andπmesons. Then suppose we are seekingsome description of the states and resonances of the12C nucleus, which we may denoteS(12C). For convenience here, we project the description onto the positions of resonancesrelevant to stellar nucleosynthesis.By assumption onN,wecan write a prediction of the12C structure in the form of aconditional probability:P(S(12C)|N)P(S(12C)|N)issimply the index function taking value one on the structure predicted byN, and zero elsewhere. (Given the purpose and limitations of the example, it is adigression to distinguish a discrete index function from a Diracδ-functional ifNand theresonances have real-valued parameters, or the more realistic case where inputs andoutputs have probability measures generated exogenously by measurement precision.)At any time, the completeness or accuracy of calculations of nuclear structure islimited. In the 1950s, the limitations were severe. We can measure the degree ofintractability by identifying a proper subsetˆN⊂Nof rules and parameters usable incalculations and the appropriately normalized index function (no longer having one"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"412Eric Smith and Harold J. Morowitzsolution) of structures admitted byˆN:P(S(12C)|ˆN)ˆNmay be as crude as the Fermi liquid theory for nucleons, plus classical estimates ofelectromagnetic energy density, andP(S(12C)|ˆN).may have such broad support that itplaces essentially no restriction on stellar nucleosynthesis. For this reason, we introduceHoyle’s posterior observation of estimated carbon abundances.Denote byˆA(M) the estimated cosmic metal abundance given the observation of lifeon earth, where “metal” conventionally denotes carbon and all heavier elements. Supposecosmology and astrophysics offer some set ˆχof inputs to tractable calculations forgeneratingˆA(M), which includes primordial nuclear abundances, but also models of starand planetary-system formation. For simplicity, we first treat ˆχandˆNas independent, asthey effectively were for Hoyle, but later come back and revise this assumption torepresent more recent cosmological anthropic arguments.A range of parameters may exist for ˆχ, because of computational intractability such ascurrently afflicts planetary-system formation [15]orevenofthe lack of a theory about theexistence of a unique putative characterizationχ[4, 5, 6]. Unlike the case for the usablesubsetˆN, identified uniquely by the Standard Model and methodological constraints, itmakes sense to sum over the parameters of ˆχwith some distributionP(ˆχ). The nuclearand astrophysical inputs provide a joint distribution:P(ˆA(M)S(12C)|ˆN)=\tˆχP(ˆA(M)S(12C)|ˆχˆN)P(ˆχ)(18.A1)P(ˆA(M)S(12C)|ˆχˆN)isthe index function for admitted values of12C structure and metalabundance given ˆχandˆN.Constructively, the12C structure is prior in principle to the metal abundance, but theprocedure to extract it is intractable, whereas the empirical metal abundance is readilyaccessible. Thus, we factor Equations (18.A1)intwodifferent ways, using the chain rulefor probabilities:P(ˆA(M)S(12C)|ˆN)=\tˆχP(ˆA(M)|S(12C)ˆNˆχ)P(S(12C)|ˆN)P(ˆχ)=P(S(12C)|ˆA(M)ˆN)\tˆχP(ˆA(M)|ˆNˆχ)P(ˆχ)(18.A2)where the conditional probabilityP(S(12C)|ˆχˆN) formally required by the chain rule hasbeen shortened toP(S(12C)|ˆN)inkeeping with our assumption that nuclear structure isconditionally independent of cosmological parameters givenNand that the maximalconstructively usable subset ofNisˆN.Expanding the probability for abundances in Equation18.A2as\tˆχP(ˆA(M)|ˆNˆχ)P(ˆχ)=\tˆχ,S\u0005P(ˆA(M)|S\u0005(12C)ˆNˆχ)P(S\u0005(12C)|ˆN)P(ˆχ)(18.A3)Bayes’s theorem is the rearrangementP(S(12C)|ˆA(M)ˆN)=\tˆχP(ˆA(M)|S(12C)ˆNˆχ)P(S(12C)|ˆN)P(ˆχ)\tˆχ,S\u0005P(ˆA(M)|S\u0005(12C)ˆNˆχ)P(S\u0005(12C)|ˆN)P(ˆχ)(18.A4)Hoyle observed that non-trace metal abundances result only from those approximatecalculationsP(ˆA(M)|S(12C)ˆNˆχ) whereS(12C) has a resonance within a relatively narrow"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"18 Fine-tuning for intermediary metabolism413range around 7.6 MeV. The actual structure of this prediction has since been refined [95].IfP(S(12C)|ˆN) andP(ˆχ) are comparatively featureless and bounded in the range wherethese forward predictions are made, then the support of the posterior distribution forS(12C) is a narrow region around 7.6 MeV.Minimal interpretation: a pragmatic pruning ruleHoyle’s argument narrowsP(S(12C)|ˆA(M)ˆN) relative toP(S(12C)ˆN)tothe extent thatP(ˆA(M)|S\u0005(12C)ˆNˆχ)isasharply peaked prediction of metal abundance. (S\u0005(12C)|ˆN)isanaugmented nuclear model based on a constructively prior but unknown input. As values ofS\u0005(12C) are not tightly constrained byP(S\u0005(12C)|ˆN), the unaugmented rulesˆNsimplycoarsely bound the search space for this input. Similarly, ifP(ˆχ)isgenerated fromobservations of the local galactic neighborhood and the Copernican assumption ofmediocrity, it is primarily limited by confidence in planetary-system models that do notalter terrestrial relative to cosmic abundances by many orders of magnitude. Thus, in thisapplication it could be replaced by some “given” value of ( ˆχ) (as were the “given” rulesˆN) without changing the results.Hoyle’s posterior observation ofˆA(M) thus generated a pruning rule [11, 13]bywhichthe experimentally likely configurations forS(12C) were narrowed for Fowler andWhaling. Its predictive specificity comes from the quality of the indexP(ˆA(M)|S\u0005(12C)ˆNˆχ), but the commitment to priorsˆNandP(ˆχ) comes from outside thisproblem. Such exogenous Bayesian priors can always (in principle) undermine thespecificity of any modelP(ˆA(M)|S\u0005(12C)ˆNˆχ) that depends on them non-trivially, a formalrecognition of the fact that scientific conclusions inevitably depend on philosophical (or,more neutrally, methodological) commitments external to scientific reasoning [15].In this problem,ˆNand ˆχmay themselves be regarded as posterior to the collectivevalidation sets of nuclear physics and astrophysics and cosmology, with distributionsvastly narrowed relative to the true ontological priors. Furthermore, the preferredaugmented model (S(12C)ˆN)inthis pragmatic interpretation of Hoyle’s anthropicargument was provisional, required either to be derivable fromNwith improvedcomputations or to act as an experimental constraint on improved estimates ofNinkeeping with the reductionist program [11]. Weakening of both features in multiversescenarios [5, 6] and Henderson’s conception of environmental fitness [7] significantlychanges the interpretation of both the posteriors and anthropic reasoning.The conservative cosmological extensionA representative anthropic argument from carbon abundance relevant to multiversecosmology uses the same variables with a slightly different interpretation. Suppose nowthat nuclear physics depends on the cosmological model through parameters (e.g.arbitrary features of consistent solutions to some more fundamental grand unified theory)and thatˆNis the subset of parameter-independent features (rather than those that aresimple to use). Then expand ˆχto include the cosmological parameters that aretheoretically variable, and suppose that structures such asS(12C) are predictable fromˆNand ˆχwith some index functionP(S(12C)|ˆNˆχ)"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"414Eric Smith and Harold J.

The best we cando then is factorP(ˆA(M)S(12C) ˆχ|ˆN)=P(ˆA(M)S(12C)|ˆNˆχ)P(ˆχ)(18.A7)possibly extendingˆA(M)toseveral features on which life appears to depend sensitively.The anthropic Bayesian posterior becomesP(S(12C) ˆχ|ˆA(M)ˆN)=P(ˆA(M)|S(12C) ˆχˆN)P(S(12C) ˆχ|ˆN)\tˆχ\u0005,S\u0005P(ˆA(M)|S\u0005(12C) ˆχ\u0005ˆN)P(S\u0005(12C) ˆχ\u0005|ˆN)(18.A8)The constructive modelP(ˆA(M)|S(12C) ˆχˆN) acts as before, as a filter on the priorP(S(12C) ˆχ|ˆN) output from the cosmological theory. In this respect, the anthropic bias isindistinguishable from the pruning rule generated by Hoyle; but as it is driven byincomplete theoretical specification rather than mere intractability, the posteriordistribution is not provisional and cannot act as a constraint on reductionist refinements ofˆNor ˆχ.Itisnot a substitute for a theory of particular initial conditions, because it addsnothing axiomatic to the structure of the causal theories represented byP(ˆA(M)|S(12C) ˆχˆN) andP(S(12C) ˆχ|ˆN), and it places no constraints on the latter if theformer is sufficiently sharp. At most, it elaborates the structure of conditional posteriordistributions that we can practically sample.The “fine-tuning” interpretationThe difference between the conservative and radical interpretations of anthropicarguments for cosmological initial conditions corresponds roughly to the differencebetween frequentist and Bayesian interpretations of the distribution (S(12C) ˆχ|ˆN)wehaveused as a prior in Equation18.A8. (This terminology should not mask the fact thatBayes’s theorem relates prior to posterior distributions under successive observations ineither interpretation.)Cosmological theories that generate a distribution of universes correspond to afrequentist interpretation in which all possible universes (S(12C) ˆχ) are “really”instantiated. Even if we are unable to sample them in direct experience, denying us thestrict frequentist interpretation, our commitment to a theory (made for whateverexogenous reasons) generates a frequentist definition forP(S(12C) ˆχ|ˆN). Under thisinterpretation, anthropic bias limits the range of posterior observables sampled by ourexperience relative to those generated by the process that defines the distribution.The alternative “Bayesian” interpretation ofP(S(12C) ˆχ|ˆN) retains the idea of a single,entire universe in which values of initial conditions (S(12C) ˆχ) should be regarded as fixedaspects of a uniqueN, and no maximal invariant proper subsetˆN⊂Nexists. Althoughtheories of initial conditions are by assumption not causal, they are expected to commit tospecific forms the same way they currently specify the algorithmic structure of naturallaws. A non-sharpP(S(12C) ˆχ|ˆN)isthen associated by Bayesians with a range of"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"18 Fine-tuning for intermediary metabolism415“beliefs,” of which all but the correct (S(12C) ˆχ) are interpreted as so-calledcounterfactuals.If the index functionP(ˆA(M)|S(12C) ˆχˆN)ofthe generative model is sharp, as it is forcarbon nucleosynthesis, then a well-defined posteriorP(S(12C) ˆχ|ˆA(M)ˆN)isconsistentwith initial conditions only in the support of that index function. IfˆA(M)isconstructivelyposterior, and the constructive priors admitted counterfactuals (S(12C) ˆχ) relative to theposteriorP(S(12C) ˆχ|ˆA(M)ˆN), then a Bayesian interpretation of the theories of initialconditions claims that a constructive prior is missing, and the theory is incomplete. Therequisite constructive prior is called “finely tuned” with respect to the posterior anthropicobservationˆA(M)ifthe support ofP(ˆA(M)|S(12C) ˆχˆN) has some small measure relativeto the support of the current priorP(S(12C) ˆχ|ˆN). An intrinsic measure of sensitivity inHoyle’s prediction is the half-width of the resonance, a characteristic scale for nuclearfeatures, divided by the center frequency of the resonance.In the Bayesian interpretation, the “belief system” that generates priorsP(S(12C) ˆχ|ˆN)originates outside scientific methodology for discovering causal laws. Thus, theinterpretation of additional finely tuned principles that omit counterfactuals from the prior,while leavingˆA(M) posterior to the causal dynamics, is extrascientific.One cannot, however, sensibly define a constructive prior to choose initial conditions“only” to produce the observed posterior observationsˆA(M). If the condition of equalitybetweenP(S(12C) ˆχ|ˆA(M)ˆN) andP(S(12C) ˆχ|ˆN) does not affect the causal dynamicsP(ˆA(M)|S(12C) ˆχˆN) (miraculous intervention excluded from conventional natural law[15]), then it is a tautology within the anthropic argument, imposing no selection on priorbeliefs other than what is computed in the posteriors, and thus having no constructive role.A non-trivial constructive prior would be some theory of initial conditions thatproduces equivalentP(S(12C) ˆχ|ˆA(M)ˆN) andP(S(12C) ˆχ|ˆN) and also places constraintson other posterior observables. The theological overtones often given to fine-tuningarguments, even when not directly stated [93], presumably intend to establish a linkbetween initial conditions permitting the emergence of carbon-based life and thoseimplying a favored moral system (thus also in principle observable) through someextra-human construct such as Kant’s categorical imperative [96].The choice of anthropic evidenceThe posterior evidence variableˆA(M) has three distinguishable roles in the three anthropicinterpretations we have presented. It is chosen for predictive specificity in the generationof a pruning rule; for appropriateness as a constraint on the observable ensemble inmultiverse cosmology; and for selectivity of those aspects of initial conditions we regardas relevant to modification of beliefs in the Bayesian cosmological interpretation.In all three applications, the quantity we really want to compute is (some generalizationof)P(S(12C) ˆχ|ˆN)=P(S(12C) ˆχ|ˆA(M)ˆN)P(ˆA(M))(18.A9)In the original work of Hoyle and Fowler,P(ˆA(M)) represents estimation uncertainty,from measurement precision and model diversity, of a single character selected for itssensitivity and relevance to a specific experimental problem. In cosmological models ofeither type,P(ˆA(M)) can also represent a distribution over alternative characters regardedas substitutes for identifying the posterior distribution we wish to specify.Toextend the former role from Hoyle’s example to biochemistry, we must specify whatintractable problem we wish to prune in order to choose the relevant and readily"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"416Eric Smith and Harold J.

However,I recognize, of course, that so far it remains an unsolved problem, and even anunfathomable one. We scientists are playing with partial explanatory hypothesesand have few hard facts at our disposal. Therefore, we must remain humble inattempting to describe each scenario and be careful to discuss each one’s constraints,recognizing where the scenarios may be flexible to synthesis with other hypotheses.Thus, my present discussion explores some areas in which there may indeed be someflexibility in terms of what solutions could potentially lead to living systems – inother words, where some “coarse-tuning” might be tolerable.Specifically, I address the following series of questions:1.Is life necessarily based on carbon?2.Must the “bricks of life” have originated by some process closely related to Miller’s“spark tube” experiment, or do other possibilities exist?3.Is it necessary that any kind of life be associated with water from the start?4.Is it necessary for any kind of life to be cellular and for the cells to be bounded in waterby membranes?5.Are then-acyl phospholipids of “classical” membranes, or the more recently discoveredarchaeal lipids, plausible constituents of primitive membranes?6.Could early membrane-forming amphiphiles have simply been polyprenyl phosphates,following the “Strasbourg scenario” (Biraultet al., 1996)?7.Are there automatic consequences of the self-organization of amphiphiles (such aspolyprenyl phosphates) in water into membranes, and does this lead to novel properties?Specifically, I consider the available evidence for the following features of membranes:∗Sadly, Professor Ourisson passed away while this book was in production.

Can these remain functional?Against this background, I will examine how “coarsely tuned” these simultaneouseffects can be – that is, what variations can occur and what flexibility does thisenable? I shall finish close to where I started, with a confession: that major problemsremain and gaps in our current understanding exist. Put frankly and simply, nobodyknows yet how life originated. As I concentrate on the fine- and coarse-tuningaspects of life, I will refer to some of the many detailed reviews of the topic ofprebiotic chemistry for more specific discussions (see, for example, Miller andOrgel,1974; Sutherland and Whitfield,1997).Is life necessarily based on carbon?All known living organisms use a carbon-based chemistry, and the huge varietyof constituents of living organisms stems from the incredible flexibility of organicchemistry. Yet, against the possibility of building an infinite variety of carbon-basedbuilding blocks, the universal biochemistry of life as we know it involves a relativelylimited set of “bricks of life,” universal constituents of all living organisms – aminoacids, nucleotides, sugars, lipids, and so forth – to which I add terpenes (see morebelow). Put another way, “secondary metabolites” are...well, secondary.Based on what is known of silicon chemistry to date, a silicon-based life looksrather improbable. Some science fiction has “described” living organisms basedon silicon,1butnoreally complex silicon derivative has been prepared so far.However, this restriction may well be temporary, as the possibility of the existenceof complex silicon derivatives has been established by experiments in which high-energy molecular beams of dihydrogen and dinitrogen were focused onto a silicon(or silica) target in an atmosphere of dioxygen at very low pressure (Devienneet al., 1998, 2002) (see Figure 19.1).The resulting products were extracted directly into a mass spectrometer to studytheir fragmentation in an argon collision chamber, and the atomic composition ofthe peaks obtained in this manner was checked by their satellites because of thesimultaneous existence of three isotopes of silicon:28Si (92%),29Si (5%), and30Si(3%). An unexpectedly large variety of molecular peaks have been observed, the1Fora“silicon zoo” containing artifacts “lurking” in electronic constructions, see for instance theMolecularExpressionswebsite: http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/creatures/."},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"19 Coarse-tuning in the origin of life?423H2SiSiO2HNH2H3CSiHSiO2HNH2Sila-alanineSila-glycine Figure 19.1. The possibility of the existence of complex silicon derivatives has beenestablished by experiments in which high-energy molecular beams of dihydrogenand dinitrogen were focused onto a silicon (or silica) target in an atmosphere ofdioxygen at very low pressure (Devienneet al., 2002).fragmentations of which suggest that they include sila-glycine, sila-alanine (see Fig-ure 19.1), sila-threonine, sila-uracile, sila-cytosine, sila-valine, sila-glutamine, andother sila-analogs of some of the most classical carbon-based biological molecules.These identifications remain tentative, as they are based on an interpretation of thefragmentation patterns for which no comparison standards are available. None ofthese sila-analogs has been isolated; so far, this is the only, limited indication of thepotential existence of a silicon-based chemistry of a complexity similar to that ofcarbon, and we must provisionally accept that only carbon can support life. How-ever, further study of complex silicon analogs of bio-organic molecules would beinteresting and helpful to justify such views one way or the other.Must the “bricks of life” have originated by some process closely related toMiller’s “spark tube” experiment, or do other possibilities exist?Assuming carbon-based life, we may turn now to the origin of the “bricks of life”themselves, the universal constituents of all living organisms.Just over fifty years ago, a major breakthrough occurred: the celebrated Miller“spark tube” experiment (Miller,1953), in which sparks (simulating electric storms)in a putative prebiotic atmosphere of methane, ammonia, dihydrogen, and waterproduced, under recycling conditions, a complex mixture of products containing inparticular a variety ofα-amino acids (identical to those used by all living organisms)(Miller,1953).Some critics assert that Miller’s atmosphere was “too reducing” to be credibleas a prebiotic model (Bada and Lazcano,2003). Dihydrogen, with its very lowmolecular mass and resultant high average speed, higher than the “escape velocity”on a planet the size of earth, could not have been a permanent constituent of ouratmosphere because it would escape into space. However, other recent experimentshave shown that by having the right elements (H, C, N, O), providing them withenough energy, and quickly cooling the system, a wide variety of bricks of life canbe obtained, not only by “Miller sparks,” but also by very different processes, suchas:"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"424Guy Ourisson\u0001UV irradiation of ice particles loaded with impurities providing the necessary atoms.This procedure had been designed explicitly to simulate the possibility that the bricks oflife had been produced by solar irradiation on “dirty” ice crystals in the primitive earthstratosphere (Bernsteinet al., 2002;Mu ̃noz Caroet al., 2002).\u0001High-energy molecular beams of the appropriate atoms hitting a graphite target simulatinginterstellar grains (Devienneet al., 1998). Note that in this case, unlike in the silicon casementioned earlier, apositiveproof of the identity of the molecules formed was provided bythe very convincing direct comparison of their mass spectrometric fragmentations withthose of authentic materials. Several of the proteinous amino acids, as well as severalnucleotides, have thus been identified.These experiments could all be interpreted in the same way. In all cases, the requiredatoms have to be provided in some molecular form. They must be raised to ahigh energy level by some physical process (sparks, photo-excitation, high-energymolecular bombardment), and the resulting excited mixture (“soup,” or plasma)must be quenched to produce the products observed, including the required bricksof life. This interpretation also allows us to predict that any process in whichone could inject enough energy into simple molecules containing the right atoms,followed by quick cooling, might work just as well. This suggests that a watersolution of, for example, formamide, sodium carbamate, or urea, sonicated underconditions energetic enough to lead to cavitation (and therefore to very high localtemperatures followed by very fast cooling), might also lead to a spark-tube-likeprocess. This prediction has not yet been tested.All these abiotic syntheses yield, of course, only racemic mixtures of all the chi-ral products obtained. A word is in order at this stage about the “chirality problem.”All proteinousα-amino acids are of the samel-chiral series and are “homochiral.”Much work has been devoted to the development of processes leading to homochi-rality, and these are well-established and of the utmost importance in syntheticorganic chemistry. However, one may anticipate that a natural homochiral systemcontaining thed-antipodes, and only them, would be equally viable – but would bejust a “through the looking glass” world. By contrast, of course, in a world where thel-andd-antipodes were simultaneously involved, intractable complexities wouldresult. For instance,l-Ala–l-Ala is a substance different fromd-Ala–l-Ala. A veryearly chance step leading to anl,ldimer might have been all that was needed toorient our world toward the homochiral set of molecules we know today. One mustalso take into account the fact that once some molecules are enriched in one oftheir homochiral varieties, they can display catalytic properties enabling them to“seed” chirality into the products obtained. The enantiomeric excesses observedare, for the time being, very low; but the number of cases studied is also quitelimited (Pizzarello and Weber,2004)."},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"19 Coarse-tuning in the origin of life?425HOHHNHC=OHFigure 19.2. Water and formamide.Furthermore, does an intrinsic reason exist in our world to exclusively use thel-amino acids instead of thed-series? It is remarkable that the amino acids iso-lated from extraterrestrial organic matter from meteorites that are at least some-what carbonaceous are slightly enriched in the enantiomers of the samel-series asthose present in the amino acids of living organisms (Pizzarello,2004). This wouldbecome a serious question only once we have discoveredafewother life-forms inthe universeand found themallto be based onl-amino acids. I know that othershave a different point of view and consider theoriginof chirality and of homochi-rality to be an important problem. I think it is not, in contrast with some related butsimpler questions, such as that of thepropagationof homochirality.Is it a necessity that any kind of life be associated with water from the start?Life as we know it is so intimately associated with water that the detection of wateron a planet would be considered a prerequisite, and even a possible indicator, ofthe presence of some life. This view is linked in particular with the hypothesisthat living organisms must be cellular (see below), and the formation of cells is, asfarascurrent knowledge tells us, linked with the special properties of water: veryhigh dielectric constant, considerable cohesive forces, and formation of “hydrogenbonds.” These factors add up to produce what is known as the “hydrophobic effect”(Tanford,1978; Blokzijl and Engberts,1993; Lemieux,1996). Indeed, we think thatwe understand why, in a liquid of high dielectric constant (such as water), properlybuilt amphiphilic molecules can become self-organized into surface monolayers,micelles, and eventually vesicles (liposomes) in which “inside water” is separatedfrom “outside water” by a membrane (Israelachviliet al., 1980). However, is wateritself specifically and exclusively required?It has been suggested (although as far as I know only in science fiction!) thatliquid ammonia might be an equivalent of water. I know of no experimental resultssuggesting that ammonia might display “organizing” properties similar to those ofwater, but related substances do. In formamide, for example, the elements of water,H and O, are present and separated by the insert N–CH (see Figure19.2).Formamide exhibits a high dielectric constant, is strongly H-bonding, and isa highly organizing solvent. Micelles, and even vesicles, have been obtained in"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"426Guy Ourissonformamide with the same phospholipids as in water (Rico and Lattes,1986). Theproperties of formamide and of other water mimics certainly deserve more study,even though the possibility that they might support other forms of life looks ratherthin. Formamide would have to be primarily formed, and we do not see how atpresent.Is it necessary for any kind of life to be cellular, and for the cells to bebounded in water by membranes?Leaving aside the possible limitations mentioned below, living organisms are cel-lular. Cells are limited by membranes, and the singular importance of this cellularstructure has been emphasized repeatedly, most forcefully and perceptively byHarold Morowitz, who is represented in Chapter18of this volume (Morowitzet al., 1988; Morowitz,1992). The widely accepted model of membranes is thatof Singer and Nicolson (1972), in which the cells are considered to be limitedby a “fluid mosaic” membrane built of phospholipids arranged as a double layer.Intrinsic membrane proteins float within this lipid bilayer, to which are hooked,by lipophilic tethers, membrane-bound appendages such as sugars, proteins, andvarious receptors. Inside the cells, the cytoskeleton ensures stability and displaysavariety of important functions. Cells are complex microscopic units defined bysuch membranes, and the only way to define separate compartments in an aqueousenvironment is to separate “inside water” from “outside water” by means of such awater-insoluble semi-permeable wall.However, the following points are worthy of consideration. First, several groupsof organisms are not “cellular” in the usual sense of the word. For example, the well-known hardy sea algaeCaulerpaspp., and probably other Siphonales species, arecharacterized by a plurinucleate macroscopic structure that resembles a “normal”green alga, but contains no individual cells.Second, and perhaps more fundamental, is that at least one conceivable alterna-tive system with “water inside” separated from “water outside” could theoreticallyexist, namely a very large dendrimer. Dendrimers are molecular structures builtof branches filling up more and more of the available space progressively as theydiverge. Known dendrimers (all fully synthetic) are much too small to define abiologically useful interior space. However, this would not necessarily apply toextremely large dendrimers, built like a boxwood topiary, in which the successivebranchings would leave enough space inside to accommodate water and analogsof cytoplasmic structures, terminated at the periphery in a dense outer surface of“twigs” that effectively would create a semipermeable barrier functionally equiva-lent to a membrane.

Small amounts of theseamphiphilic molecules produce surface films; larger amounts lead to bulk assem-blies, in which clusters of molecules minimize their destructive effect on the net-work of hydrogen bonds by forming micelles or vesicles (liposomes) with a specifictopology that depends on the concentration and specific shape of the amphiphilicmolecules (see Figure19.6)."},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"19 Coarse-tuning in the origin of life?429This self-complexification leads to a major consequence: vesicles are the sim-plest objects in which an inside compartment is formed spontaneously through theinterplay of physical factors that we understand at least qualitatively. Such a spon-taneous compartmentalization is, of course, an attractive candidate as a prototypeof universal cellular organization in living organisms. It defines an inside compart-ment, separated from the outside medium by a semipermeable fluid membrane.Also, the dimensions of spontaneously formed vesicles are of the same range asthose of living cells. But what can we say about the nature of themost primitiveamphiphiles?In fact, this point has received little attention, despite the fact that classi-cal membrane lipids display all the hallmarks of modernity. Their amphiphiliccharacter is due to the combination of a deceptively “simple”n-acyl straight chainand of a large variety of polar head-groups. The structure of the C14–20n-acyl chainsmay be easy to memorize and to draw, but it is very difficult to synthesize: noin vitroprocess has been found to give such part-structures from very small synthons. TheFischer–Tropsch reaction is often invoked, but it gives mixtures ofn- and branchedhydrocarbons or of their functionalized derivatives, but not C14–20n-acyl deriva-tives. It is used to make diesel oils (the South AfricanSasolprocess), but not (to myknowledge) edible fats withn-acyl chains.2The biosynthesis of C14–20n-acyl chainsalso implies remarkably complex processes despite their simple structures, callingas it does for seven to ten successive additions and reductions of C2units (acetatein the activated form of acetyl-coenzyme-A) and a selective control of the chainlength. Furthermore, all “modern” phospholipids requireseparatebiosyntheses fortheir glycerol and phosphocholine head groups (or variants). I think it is obviousthatn-acylphospholipids are “modern.”Interestingly, bacteria very often contain not only thesen-acyl amphiphiles, butlargely, or even mostly, mixtures of analogs with branched chains (e.g. iso- or ante-iso-, or cyclopropyl- orω-cycloalkyl-substituted chains). However, the biosyntheticprocesses required are again very complex.Some carboxylic acids have been isolated from meteorites, the sodium saltsof which have produced vesicle-like structures in water (Deamer,1986). Theiraromatic structures are, however, very different from those of any known constituentof biomembranes, and an import from the cosmos by way of meteorites does not looklike a reasonable hypothesis of the origin of the phospholipids of biomembranes.Zhang’s contribution to the present volume (Chapter 20) may well offer a majorstep forward in positing plausible prebiotic membranes.2Shortly before World War II, Reichsmarschall Hermann G ̈oring had proclaimed that Germany would produce“Kanonen statt Butter.” If it had been possible to use the Fischer–Tropsch process to producen-acyl chains, theThird Reich could have produced both cannonsandbutter."},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"430Guy Ourisson\u0001\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0001\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002Figure 19.7. Geranylgeranyl phosphate and difarnesyl phosphate.Could early membrane-forming amphiphiles have simply been polyprenylphosphates, following the “Strasbourg scenario”3?The long chains required to impart the required lipophilic character to membrane-forming lipids might rather have been, in an early world, polyprenyl, identical withthose found in Archaea. This would require much simpler biosyntheses: just threeor four identical condensations of C5units, by reactions that can be simulated onclays, can produce such molecules (D ́esaubryet al., 2003). One could even conceiveof such a cascade of C5condensations terminated selectively at the third (C15)orfourth (C20) step by physical segregation because of spontaneous vesicle formation.Thus, polyprenyl chains are convincingly plausible as potential “primitive” lipids inthat they can be synthesizedin vitrowithout enzymes. However, the actual archaeallipids are themselves still much too complex to be prototypical; for example, theyare actually more diverse than their eukaryotic counterparts in their polar head-groups. This is why we have been led to formulate the hypothesis that simplephosphates of polyprenyl alcohols, with only a simple phosphate group as a polarhead and without any further complicating feature, might produce vesicles in water.This hypothesis has been fully validated, both for molecules containing a singlepolyprenyl chain and for the diesters (Pozziet al., 1996; Biraultet al., 1996).Specifically, polyprenyl phosphate vesicles form easily, provided that their“lipophilic balance” (the ratio of the lipophilic part to the hydrophilic part) isadequate. Single-chain polyprenyl phosphates require at least 20 carbons (ger-anylgeranyl, phytyl, or phytanyl phosphates). Double-chain polyprenyl phosphatesrequire at least two C15(farnesyl) chains to generate vesicles, although this some-times requires the help of a small amount of the corresponding free polyprenol(Pozziet al., 1996) (see Figure19.7.)At present, polyprenyl phosphates, with C15–25chains, are the simplest vesicle-forming phospholipids known, and they may have been the most primitive mem-brane constituents. We have been pleased to discover that the properties of vesicles3See Biraultet al.(1996)."},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"19 Coarse-tuning in the origin of life?431OOOHOOO Figure 19.8. “Simple” reactions leading to the C5unit of isopentenol.made of these polyprenyl phosphates are remarkably similar to those of vesiclesmade of the usual phospholipids.However, the origin of these polyprenyl derivatives is still not obvious. The abi-otic origin of the C5isoprenic units is very problematic, and the C5–25chains are notas easy to obtain from suitable C5precursors, as one could deduce from first-yearorganic chemistry. Indeed, although one can conceive of several reactions leadingon paperto isopentenol from simpler precursors, none withstands close scrutinyas a plausible prebiotic process. For example, the acid-catalyzed Prins reaction ofisobutene and formaldehyde (Arundale and Mikeska,1952; Blomquist and Verdol,1955; Brace,1955) has been described and is appealing because formaldehyde isa precursor favored by prebiotic chemists for its (relative) abundance in interstel-lar space, and reactions on an acidic rock as a catalyst are conceivable. However,isobutene has never been identified in space or on earth, except as a minor con-stituent of natural gas. The same is true for acetone, which might have been thesubstrate of a Paterno–B ̈uchi photochemical reaction (Paterno and Chieffi,1909;B ̈uchiet al., 1954), and for ethylene, both of which are also unlikely precursors(see Figure19.8).Furthermore, the head-groups of archaeal phospholipids are much too complexto be archaic, and I have postulated thatpolyprenyl phosphatesmight have been themost primitive membrane constituents. These phosphates can be biosynthesized byquite simple reactions, which, as we have shown, can be simulatedin vitrofromtheir C5precursors (D ́esaubryet al., 2003).The initial proposal of this scheme for the evolution of terpenes (Ourissonand Nakatani,1994)was graced with a full page “Comment” from the editor ofNature(Maddox,1994). It also led to the recognition thatall living organisms"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"432Guy Ourissonrequire and use terpenes:farnesyl and geranylgeranyl tethers link proteins tomembranes; ubiquinones, with their polyterpene chains, serve as transmembraneelectron transporters; cholesterol orα,ω-dipolar carotenoids serve as membranereinforcers; steroids are involved in mechanisms as diverse as calcium metabolism,potassium/sodium balance, sex hormones, attractants, defense substances, and soforth. Terpenes are not “secondary” metabolites!Are there automatic consequences of the self-organization of amphiphiles(such as polyprenyl phosphates) in water into membranes, and does thislead to novel properties?The self-organization of amphiphiles (e.g. polyprenyl phosphates) in water leadsto important consequences and to novel properties, such as the following.\u0001It makes possible aselective concentrationof lipophiles in the membranes. Vesiclesmade ofn-acyl lipids or of polyprenyl phosphates extract selectively into the mem-brane any lipophilic substance: lipophilic pigments (Nile Red), cholesterol, polyprenols,carotenoids, etc. This is particularly important for those lipophilic substances that playa role in stabilizing the membrane: cholesterol, hopanoids, polyprenols, and carotenoids(Bisseretet al., 1983; Milonet al., 1986; Lazraket al.,1988; Krajewski-Bertrandet al.,1990).\u0001The increased concentration leads in turn tonovel reactionsof some lipophiles in the mem-brane. Ringsdorf and colleagues (Foldaet al., 1982) and Luisi and colleagues (Blocheret al., 1999)have shown that some lipophilic derivatives of amino acids are selectivelyextracted into the membranes and can spontaneously condense into lipophilic derivativesof oligopeptides without requiring any biocatalyst such as a peptidase. However, thispotentially exciting finding must be tempered with caution: this condensation does notlead to the spontaneous formation of polypeptides larger than di- or tripeptides, and itoccurs only when specific, modified, and activated amino-acid derivatives are presented.In short, it seems unlikely that this concentration effect may have led to a primitive syn-thesis of proteins. Perhaps more interesting is that analogous condensations have beenobserved with long-chain esters ofα-amino acids in mono- and multilayers adsorbed ona solid surface, where again the concentration is locally increased (Fukudaet al., 1981).\u0001On a different note, anisotropic molecules, once extracted fully or partly into the mem-brane, becomeselectively oriented.Byitself, the inside of the membrane is a highlyanisotropic, hairbrush-like, lipophilic solvent. Any anisotropic lipophilic molecule selec-tively extracted into the membrane must therefore automatically become oriented toavoid the unfavorable energetics of disrupting this ordered state. Indeed, it has beenshown experimentally (by specific labeling with a transmembrane photosensitive probe)that cholesterol is orientedperpendicularlyto the membrane in closed vesicles (Nakataniet al., 1996). By contrast, the linear hydrocarbonβ-carotene has been shown (by lin-ear dichroism spectroscopy on flat bilayer stacks) to lieparallelto the surface (Nord ́en"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"19 Coarse-tuning in the origin of life?433et al., 1977). In other words, membranes are a class of structure that can encourage theformation of order from disorder, a theme that is central to understanding the origins oflife.\u0001The membrane becomes spontaneously more complex by the automatic induction ofvectorial properties. The membrane is made of all identical molecules of amphiphiles.However, those forming the exterior, convex leaflet are less compressed than those form-ing the inside, concave one. The two groups, although formed of identical molecules,become different by virtue of their different surroundings (Chrzeszczyket al., 1977).This difference has been explored with further experimentation, for instance by the sep-aration of the31P NMR signals of the polar head-groups of the inside and of the outsidelayers (identified by their different intensities because of the smaller number of moleculescontained in the inner half of the membrane). Moreover, these vectorial properties engen-dered by self-organization extend to produce segregation of different phospholipids whenmixtures of amphiphiles are used (Swairjoet al., 1994; Leeet al., 2002).\u0001Further complexification can be obtained beyond the lipid bilayer itself by the formation ofa pseudo-cell wall. Specifically, if pullulan (a fungal metabolite with a long polysaccharidechain) is anchored onto the membrane by a cholesterol or a polyprenyl substituent asa tether and labeled with a fluorescent tag, this spontaneously leads to coating of theoutside surface of the vesicles by the polysaccharide, as can be observed by opticalmicroscopy (Uedaet al., 1998; Ghoshet al., 2000). In other words, a pseudo-cell wall ofpolysaccharide spontaneously forms, although this process is efficient only with a goodmatch between the chains of the phospholipid and the lipidic tethers (a cholesteryl tetherforn-acyl-phospholipid vesicles, a polyprenyl one for polyprenyl phosphate vesicles).\u0001Most significantly, self-organization can include a form of self-replication. It is pos-sible to obtain self-multiplying closed vesicles or vesicles as long as they contain atleast some of the essential elements of a living cell. Specifically, a micelle that containsenzymes hydrolyzing additional precursors of the membrane amphiphiles is automati-cally increasing the total volume of the membrane. At first, this leads to expansion of thesingle micelle, but as further lipids are added the micelle self-replicates by a process thatresembles bacterial multiplication by budding (Bachmannet al., 1990, 1991).\u0001This brings us to the topic of whether and which biological macromolecules can beincorporated into micelles. Much work has focused on the incorporation of DNA intolipid vesicles since Jay and Gilbert (1987) first showed that basic protein can enhancethis process (see, for example, Monnardet al., 1997; Szostaket al., 2001). Indeed, apolymerase chain reaction (the standard method for duplicating nucleic acid sequencesin vitro) can be run in closed vesicles (Oberholzeret al., 1995a), and enzymatic RNAreplication has been achieved in self-replicating vesicles (Oberholzeret al., 1995b). It ispossible to obtain closed vesicles containing at least some of the essential elements of aliving cell, for instance nucleic acids.Giant DNAs or RNAs observable with an optical microscope after being labeledwith a fluorescent tag can be injected into these vesicles with laser tweezers, aprocess akin to artificial fecundation or simply trapped during vesicle formation"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"434Guy Ourissonby hydration, a surprisingly efficient process (Nomuraet al., 2001). They remainfunctional once inside the vesicles, as shown by the synthesis of the green fluo-rescent protein, and are protected from outside DNases/RNases (Nomuraet al.,2003).Aprovisional summaryOur knowledge of which type of biochemistry is and is not possible in this universeis hampered by an obvious limitation: at present, we know of only one version oflife. As a result, when considering the possible “biocentric” nature of our universe,we must use clues from synthetic chemistry and physics to infer what aspects of thisterrestrial life are necessary and whether alternative scenarios could be built, ensur-ing in different but convergent ways the major features of life: self-organization andevolution despite homeostasis. In this chapter, I have collected and discussed someof the most prevalent ideas and insights from the “origin of life” field of research tosketch a framework for introducing this topic. I have shown that although silicon-based life might be possible, current knowledge indicates that life is carbon-based.Ihave also shown that although water-alternatives might support life, we can sus-pect that a strongly dipolar, hydrogen-bonded liquid is probably necessary for life,and it seems obvious that water is by far the most likely candidate. In addition, Ihave shown that at least a subset of the fundamental chemical building blocks fromwhich life is constructed are likely to be widely distributed throughout the universeand are intuitive “choices” for life elsewhere. Finally and most importantly, I havetackled the all-important topic of how independent, self-replicating entities mightform, given these building blocks.My view is that amphiphilic molecules are the key to understanding how lifecould – and would – emerge from such a biochemically interesting universe. Theirself-organization into membranes leads to closed vesicles, which define outer andinner compartments, and spontaneously to self-complexification by the accretionof novel properties. This self-complexification, in turn, renders membranes highlygermane to exploring the notion of a “biocentric” universe.The above seems to constitute the beginnings of a potentially fertile scenario.However, we must acknowledge the existence of some major problems.Some problemsSome problems tend to be hidden, but deserve to be highlighted. A general problemwith all scenarios for the origin of life appears to be that of local concentrations ofthe initial molecular precursors. The image of the “warm little pond” by the side ofthe sea, concentrated by evaporation and replenished by wave splashes, had beenproposed by Darwin (1859) and has been espoused by Miller and Orgel (1974)"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"19 Coarse-tuning in the origin of life?435and many others. This image is appealing, but difficult or impossible to submitto experiment; therefore, it remains just “comfortable” and impossible to prove(Shapiro,1986). Bernal suggested that concentration might have been achievedby adsorption onto clay particles, a chemically very reasonable hypothesis, thathas been developed by Cairns-Smith (Cairns-Smith and Hartmann,1986) into histheory of a primitive “surface life” on appropriate minerals. This is again appealing,but not compelling; personally, I have never understood how a two-dimensional lifeform might have originated on a clay particle – and even less how it could laterhave exploded into the third dimension.Aparticularly poignant problem is that life as we know it involves phosphatesas polar groups, and there is no obvious major source of phosphates. AlthoughWestheimer (1987) has given very powerful arguments to show why nature has“chosen” phosphates instead of sulfates or some other polar group, this is in contrastto the fact that phosphorus is a relatively rare element in the universe:4Universe7 ppbCrustal rocks1,000 ppbSeawater0.070 ppbHumans11,000 ppbApart from phosphate rock originated in the deposition and fossilization of marineorganisms, no large reservoir of phosphate is known, and natural abiotic sourcesare few, dilute, and very localized (e.g. volcanic springs).5Furthermore, phosphates and polyphosphates display a very low reactivity inphosphorylation; this leads to the difficulty of producing organic phosphates fromthe corresponding alcohols, without enzymes, and therefore of involving them inthe origin of life. (It also leads to difficulties in hydrolyzing them, which is a goodthing for life, but a bad one for water-treatment plants, where one must resort to abacterial treatment to hydrolyze the polyphosphates.) A plausible way out of thisdifficulty might be to rely on the activation of phosphates by carboxylates (Bironand Pascal,2004). One should refer in this connection to the much-too-neglectedwork of Baltcheffsky and Baltcheffsky (1992), showing that sodium polyphos-phates may have been precursors of activated phosphates such as adenosinetriphosphate.ConclusionAvalid conclusion of this review is, of course, “We do not know!” Furthermore,currently we have no efficient search plan.

Without water, life would beeither impossible or totally different. Thus, a deep understanding of the relationshipbetween water and other simple building blocks of life is crucial to gain insightinto how prebiotic life forms could have originated and evolved and whether thephysical laws of this universe are in any way predisposed to the emergence of life(Henderson,1913, 1917; Eisenberg and Kauzmann,1985; Ball,2001).It is unlikely that under prebiotic conditions the complex and sophisticatedbiomacromolecules commonplace in modern biochemistry would have existed.Thus, research into the origin of life is intimately associated with the search forplausible systems that are much simpler than those we see today. However, it isalso plausible that these simple building blocks of life might have been amphiphilicmolecules in which water could have had an enormous influence on their prebi-otic molecular selection and evolution, because water can either form clathratestructures or drive these simplest molecules together (Ball,2001).Structure of waterWater is both simple and complex. It is simple because it consists of only one oxy-gen atom and two hydrogen atoms (see Figure20.1). But at the same time it exhibitshighly complex molecular behavior (far exceeding the multibody problem in math-ematics, planetary science, and astrophysics) wherever numerous water moleculesinteract dynamically (Eisenberg and Kauzmann,1985; Ball,2001). Indeed, thisbehavior becomes even more complex when water molecules interact with otheratoms and molecules (Eisenberg and Kauzmann,1985; Ball,2001).Fitness of the Cosmos for Life: Biochemistry and Fine-Tuning,ed.

Wherevernumerous water molecules co-exist, they form a dynamic network, constantly con-necting and disconnecting with extreme rapidity, much like constantly and rapidlyexchanging dance partners at a densely populated dance party (see Figure20.1).When temperature decreases, the length of bonds between different atoms dimin-ishes. The water molecules pack together more and more tightly and eventually forman ice structure (see Figure20.1). On the other hand, when temperature increases,bond lengths increase as atoms are stretched farther and farther apart, like recedingstars and galaxies in the universe.

When water molecules interact withnon-water substances, water molecules form a cage-like structure to surround them.Depending on the size of the substance, water molecules pack in different ways tosolubilize or to form an interface with the materials.between water molecules eventually break, and water forms vapor. Without a doubt,this “physics of water” operated billions of years ago, just as it does today. Thus,cyclical temperature fluctuations not only could have driven numerous prebioticmolecular interactions in an unpredictable way, but could also have generated pre-dictable synthesis reactions (Henderson,1913, 1917).As water molecules exhibit a dipolar moment that allows them to interact withone another and with other atoms and molecules, they can encase other moleculeswithin cage-like (“clathrate”) structures. These multifaceted balls resemble viralprotein-coats by encapsulating molecules within them (see Figure20.2). In fact,we now know of diverse clathrate structures that vary considerably, depending onthe non-water molecules involved. When non-water molecules become too large,water molecules cease to encase them, such that they aggregate and either precipitateout of water or form macromolecular interfaces with water. Precipitated aggregatesexhibit little structure, but the latter systems (multimolecular interfaces betweenwater and biopolymers) are often found in biological membranes. Many researchershave pointed out that some simple kind of membrane would have been a requirementfor the earliest metabolism to form partitions and enclosures that optimized specificreactions or sequestered important metabolites (see, for example, Morowitz,1992;Chakrabarti and Deamer,1994).Simplest enclosure system in waterIn the summer of 1992 at the “Origin of Life” Gordon Conference in New Hamp-shire, I asked two simple questions. What might be the simplest amphiphilic"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"444Shuguang Zhangbiopolymers that could self-organize to enclose other biological molecules in aprimarily aqueous prebiotic environment? Could such structures be constructedfrom the simplest of molecular building blocks? I reasoned that the biopolymerscould be neither phospholipids nor nucleic acids because they are relatively com-plex multicomponent molecules containing several distinctive parts (Hargreaveset al., 1977). Likewise, proteins seem unlikely because the polymerization of anyspecific (or even semi-specific) sequence from a “soup” of possible monomersbrings in unavoidable problems of combinatorial mathematics (moreover, mostextant proteins also require chaperone molecules to facilitate folding into the cor-rect three-dimensional shape). In short, abiotic syntheses of all three types of com-plex molecule in the prebiotic environment seem rather unlikely. I therefore askedwhether it were plausible that the simplest peptides, comprising just two or threeof the simplest amino acids, could function in this membrane/enclosure-formingcapacity. Although several groups had studied the chemistry of various amino acidsand amino acid biopolymers (Fox and Harada,1958; Brack and Orgel,1975; Brackand Spach,1981;Yanagawaet al., 1988), distinctive structures and enclosures werenot reported or observed at that time.Simplest amino acidsGlycine with a side chain (RH), alanine (RCH3), and aspartic acid(R=CH2COOH) are among the chemically and structurally simplest amino acids.They are of particular interest to prebiotic molecular evolution because of theirpresence not only in the products of biochemical simulations of earth’s presumedprebiotic environment (Miller,1953; Miller and Urey,1959; Oro and Kamat,1961;Badaet al., 1994), but also in the CI-type carbonaceous chondrites, including theOrgueil, Ivuna, and Murchison meteorites (Kvenvoldenet al., 1970;Wong andBronskill,1979; Anders,1989;Chyba and Sagan,1992; Ehrenfreundet al., 2001).Specifically, glycine is the simplest possible amino acid (it is an achiral moleculewithout any true side chains and is universally indicated to have been the mostabundant amino acid in abiotic environments).Beyond synthesis of the amino acids themselves, it has been experimentallydemonstrated that these amino acids (and their derivatives) can form peptides whensubjected to repeated hydration–dehydration cycles under microwave heating, inaqueous ammonia, or on heated clays that mimic various hypothesized conditionsof early life on the planet (Oro and Guidry,1961; Whiteet al., 1984;Yanagawaet al., 1988). Indeed, oligo-glycine appears even more easy to produce abiotically, asit has been synthesized by subjecting glycine monomers to extended exposure (morethan forty hours) of supercritical water conditions, that is under high temperature"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"20 Plausible lipid-like peptides445(several hundred degrees celsius) and high pressure (tens of atmospheres) (Gotoet al., 2004).These high-temperature and high-pressure conditions are similar to those foundin deep-sea volcanoes and hydrothermal vents, a favorite hypothesized venue forthe origin of life. It is plausible that some of the simplest biochemical buildingblocks could have produced complex life forms over eons of natural selection andevolution. The challenge, however, is to explain how sufficiently complex proteins,or ribozymes, could have been produced in the lipid membranes necessary for themetabolism of their own catalysis.If, instead of lipid membranes, simple peptides with hydrophobic tails andhydrophilic heads (made up of merely a combination of these robust, abiotically syn-thesized amino acids) could self-assemble into nanotubes or vesicles, they wouldhave the potential to provide a primitive enclosure for the earliest RNA-based(Beaudry and Joyce,1992;Wilson and Szostak,1995)orpeptide enzymes andother primitive molecular structures with a variety of functions.In other words, if such structures can be demonstrated to exist, then this makesplausible the idea that in the prebiotic world lipid-like peptides of various lengthscould form and self-organize into distinct vesicles and tubes that could act asnaturally formed enclosures, isolated from the broader environment, for prebioticrudimentary enzymes and ribozymes to accumulate. From this starting point, it isfar easier to envisage how a diverse population of peptides and RNA not only couldcondense into complex structures, but also could evolve increasing sophistication,stimulating their own synthesis and replication and evolving ultimately into thewondrously efficient chemical and biological catalysts we encounter today (Zhangand Egli,1994, 1995).Lipid-like peptides that form nanotubes and nanovesiclesTothis end, I focused on designing a class of simple amphiphilic lipid-like pep-tides that consist exclusively of plausible prebiotic amino acids. One class ofthese molecules comprises peptides that exhibit lipid-like or surfactant properties(Vautheyet al., 2002; Santosoet al., 2002a,b;von Maltzahnet al., 2003;Yang andZhang,2006; Nagaiet al., 2007). I designed such peptides with computer modeling,linking amino acids together one at a time to achieve a length and shape similarto there of lipids. Although individual chemical species within this population ofpeptides have completely different composition and sequence, they share a crucialcommon feature: a hydrophilic head comprising one or two charged amino acidsand a hydrophobic tail comprising four or more consecutive hydrophobic aminoacids (see Figure20.3). In other words, although it would be possible to designpeptides with non-charged hydrophilic heads using serine and threonine, those that"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"446Shuguang Zhang(A)(2)(3)(4)(1)A6D(B)V6DV6D2L6D2KL6KV62.4 mm(a)3.2 mm(b)3.9 mm(c)(d)4.7 mmFigure 20.3.

These lipid-like peptides can self-organize to form well-ordered nanostructures, including micelles, nanotubes, and nanovesicles in water.Furthermore, the structure formation is concentration-dependent: namely, at lowconcentration, there are no defined structures. These structures spontaneously format a critical aggregation concentration (CAC) (Yang and Zhang,2006; Nagaiet al.,2007), in a way similar to that of lipids and other surfactants.Six amino acids of varying hydrophobicity (Gly, Ala, Val, Ile, Leu, and Phe)can be used to generate the non-polar tails.

These peptides,like Lego®bricks, have two distinctive side-pegs and holes. The hydrophilic partbears charged residues, either positive charges – lysine, arginine, histidine – or neg-ative charges – aspartic acids and glutamic acids. On the other side are hydrophobicresidues – alanine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryp-tophan. Some of them can form well-ordered helical and other fibrous structures(Zhanget al., 1993, 2002; Mariniet al., 2002; Hwanget al., 2003; Zhang,2003) (seeFigures20.8–20.10). Others form non-helical fibrous structures (Zhao and Zhang,2004). They form many stable structures, as either double-layered helical or non-helical tapes that sequester hydrophobic parts because the hydrophobic residuesmust move away from water and leave the hydrophilic side exposed to water. Wateris the driving force that sequesters the hydrophobic part of a molecule, regardlessof whether it is a protein, alipid, a nucleic acid, or some other small molecule.Tosummarize, this provides one vision of a crucial bridge between the physicists’claim of a “fine-tuned universe” (one predisposed to the production of water, carbon,and nitrogen) and the reality of life on earth. The existence of stable nanotubestructures demonstrates how biochemical molecular fine-tuning could give rise tocomplex entities, presumably through a process of prebiotic molecular selectionapplied to primitive, quasi-living autocatalytic networks.Put more simply, when considering prebiotic selection and evolution in the con-text of the origin of life, the enormously powerful force of water must never beunderestimated. As all life is based on water, all molecules in living systems inter-act with it, and water likely has driven molecular evolution from the very beginning,here on earth or plausibly elsewhere in the universe – or multiverse."},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"20 Plausible lipid-like peptides453innerhelixouterhelixFigure 20.9.

R. Fra ́usto da SilvaIntroductionIf we inspect our surroundings on earth, we will see a myriad of materials, objects,natural and artificial constructions (many resulting from the activities of the humanspecies), and, of course, an enormous variety of living organisms, from the simplestbacteria to the most complex animals. We can also inspect the sky and observeother planets, stars, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies far away in our expandinguniverse, leaving us wondering whether life can also be found elsewhere. Is it allan inevitable product of such a finely tuned construct as the universe seems to be,given appropriate local conditions? At a very basic level, it must be. We are anevolved species co-existing with many other simpler species on which we depend.All are made of the same chemical elements resulting from that fine-tuning thatallowed their kinetically controlled formation in big stars and created our planetand the fields to which all life is exposed. Life must be a possibility included in afinely tuned cosmos – we sense it in our minds. We also know that it has evolvedand diversified here on earth, although the reasons for this – that is, the factors thatdetermined evolution – are not so obvious. This question has intrigued philosophersand scientists through the ages, and it reached public awareness toward the end of theeighteenth century. The names Lamarck and, especially, Darwin are perhaps mostwidely known, but many others prepared the ground for earlier developments andfor those that have followed. The progress in knowledge and understanding has beenenormous, and inquiry has extended even to the origin of life itself. Nevertheless,no accepted explanation of the origin of life exists, nor does a rational chemicaldescription of evolution. In their bookThe Major Transitions of Evolution, MaynardSmith and Szathm ́ary [1]gosofar as to state that evolution has resulted in an increasein complexity, but that this increase “is neither universal nor inevitable.” The bookFitness of the Cosmos for Life: Biochemistry and Fine-Tuning,ed.

We consider that without reference to the environment and its changes,evolution of life cannot be understood. The environment is essentially composedof inorganic chemicals.Our purpose then in this chapter is to tackle evolution, not the origin of life,seen, however, from the point of view of the inorganic and physical chemistry ofthe combination of the environment and organisms. The elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of DNA by Watson and Crick and publication of the seminalpaper of Stanley Miller on prebiotic synthesis, both in 1953, as well as the beginningof the systematic study of the biological role of the chemical elements [2], havemade such an approach possible. A major part of our argument is, then, that thechemistry of life is not just “organic” – far from it – and that life cannot be studiedin isolation from the original and changing inorganic environmental surroundingsin which it emerged and evolved. We must bring together the nature of DNA, theprebiotic and subsequent environmental chemistry, as well as life’s chemistries. Wewill show why we believe that the resultant overall ecological development wasinevitable, but we cannot give a reason for its timing. It could have been stuck foravery long time in a given condition.Tostructure the presentation, we show in Figure21.1a rather simplistic schemeof the requirements necessary for the formation and functioning of a living cellularorganism: (1)raw materials, necessarily obtained from the environment; (2)avail-able (usable) energy, obtained from the earth’s core and mantle or from the sun’sradiation; (3)confinement(or closure), to localize the reaction space and to avoiddispersion of raw materials and products; (4)operational instructions(“informa-tion”), to allow internal self-regulation and reproduction with a minimum of error(which must not be identified with or just reduced to a geneticcode, which, by defi-nition, can code only something that already existed or developed simultaneously),to which we add (5) the ability to distinguish favorable from unfavorable conditionsin a changing environment. The environment will be seen to be a second primarysource of information (see “Steady states and final conditions” below). Because itis extremely complicated, the idea of information in a cell will be treated later. Inessence, the first four are the requirements for a reproductive organization, whilethe fifth allows an initial system to evolve. Some parallels with the evolution ofindustrial plants can be seen.In this chapter we will concentrate first on the raw materials of life, starting fromtheir constitutive chemical elements (see Figure21.2), trying to show that changesin their environmental bioavailability influenced decisively the possible increasein organizational complexity of living organisms, causing what de Duve [3] calls“vertical” evolution – that is, the major overall steps of evolutionary change [4]."},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"458R.

Although thisapproach seems to us to make intuitive good sense, it is curiously absent frommost theories and discussions of biological evolution, perhaps because evolutionhas been, through the years, a field to which many biologists, biochemists, pale-ontologists, cosmologists, physicists, organic chemists, philosophers, and othershave given their attention, largely to species, but to which inorganic chemists haveseldom contributed [1]. Again, by limiting our analysis to what in effect are thechemical classes of life – we shall call them “chemotypes” as opposed to genotypes –we avoid many of the difficulties associated with species. We consider that the con-centration on species hides the general progression, denied in reference [1], of theecosystem.Of course, life is not just a question of chemicals. Therefore, as stated, we willalso discuss topics that are equally relevant, but on which misunderstandings anddifferences of opinion persist, such as the question of the “quality” of energy and itsusefulness in achieving a possible optimal cyclic steady state; the confusion aroundthe concept of entropy and the applicability of the second law of thermodynamics to"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"460R. J. P. Williams and J. J. R. Fra ́usto da Silvastructured organizations such as living organisms; the concept of information; andthe nature and function of the whole genetic apparatus [5]. In the later part of thischapter we will attempt to impart a better understanding of these ideas, togetherwith the propositions that synergism (including symbiosis) is a major factor ofbiological evolution and that the evolution of cooperative activity in one ecosystemsuperimposes on and dominates the evolution of organisms and species. It is theecosystem that has a logical development, a view that we share with others [4,5] and that may well force a change of paradigm to allow a clearer vision of afundamental problem for humankind: the nature of life and its sustainability in anecosystem, of which we are the dominant and probably the most vulnerable part. Weturn first to the element content of organisms so as to stress the role of inorganic –apart from the well-described organic – chemicals in organisms [6, 7].The biological elementsLife seems to have emerged on earth about 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago, when theenvironment was essentially reducing [8] and free oxygen was not present in anappreciable amount. The high reactivity of oxygen had forced it to combine withhydrogen, carbon, and many less abundant elements, such as phosphorus, silicon,aluminum, calcium, iron, magnesium, sodium, and potassium, but generally notthe later transition metals (Co to Zn), which, in the absence of oxygen, combinedpreferably with sulfur to give sparingly soluble sulfides in the primordial, some-what acidic (HCl, H2S) conditions. No one knows the way in which the first livingorganisms arose in this environment, and it is doubtful that we ever will. Manytheories exist, but no fully satisfying evidence has been found concerning the origi-nal synthesis of the primordial building blocks – organic compounds together withrequired inorganic elements – on the earth or in the interstellar space to give emer-gence (in a “warm little pond” or in the deep-sea volcanic trenches) to the firstforms of cells.The same can be said of the many theories concerning the origins of organization:self-assembly (autopoiesis), self-catalyzed cycles, dissipative systems, and order-out-of-chaos – all just theories without experimental verification. Because the initialconditions for the emergence of life are not known with any certainty, it is unlikelythat we will ever manage to go beyond this nebulous thinking unless we are ableto generate life itself. We will therefore begin from a chemical analysis of organ-isms, starting from the nature of life in the most primitive cells, which existed, asrecognized by what is found today, in what we take to be a primitive environment.The facts are that living organisms exist; their current diversity is enormous;they are all cellular; their organizational complexity has increased in evolution [1];the remnants of the presumed most primitive organisms co-exist with the modern"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"21 Evolution revisited by inorganic chemists461Table 21.2.Maintained pathways throughout evolutionPathwayExampleSyntheses and degradation of saccharidesglycolysis (Mg)Dicarboxylic-acid reaction sequenceCO2incorporation in incomplete cycle;completed later to give energy capture(i.e. Krebs cycle) (Fe, Mg)Amino-acid synthesisproducts of glycolysis and Krebs cycle +NH3(Fe)Protein synthesisformyl initiation (Fe) and methionineinitiation (Fe, Co)DNA, RNA synthesisnucleic-acid pathways (Mg, Zn, Fe/S, B12,or Fe2O)Synthesis of fatsβ-carbon oxidation/reduction (flavin, Fe)Nitrogen incorporationformation of NH3(Mg, Fe, V, Mo) insymbiotic bacteriaHydrogen reactionsH2as a reductant (Fe, Ni) in anaerobicArchaeaEnergy: electron/proton flow in membranesenergy capture related to ATP (Fe, NADH,flavin, quinones)Exchange of ions in membranesosmotic and electrolyte control (Na, K, Mg,Ca, H)Light capturechlorophyll and heme (Mg, Fe)Pumps (ATPases)most elements as cations or anionsRedox balanceglutathione, Feones, cooperating actively (see below); and they all have in common a particularchemical characteristic in their cellular cytoplasm. All cells contain a basic set oforganic chemicals, proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and polysaccharides made fromthe non-metal elements H, C, N, O, P, and S. To make them environmental, carboncompounds, such as CO and CO2, had to be reduced. Their basic cytoplasmicmetabolic reactions have remained, reducing even until now – that is, throughout3.5 billion years (see Table21.2). The reason for these facts is more or less obvious:at the fixed, almost neutral pH at which seas settled, these are the set of reactionsgiving rise to biopolymers that provided the kinetic stability and activities of theorganization we observe today. We know of no others, and it is likely that noneexists. However, we need to add to the list of essential elements in these moleculesan equally large group of metal ions (see Figure21.2and Table21.3) becausepolymers have to be synthesized from different non-metal raw materials, mainlyCH4,H2O, CO, CO2,H2S, NH3, (HCN), or derived compounds resulting fromprebiotic chemistry (see Table21.2).

The primitive organisms we know, such as archaebacteria, have approximately20 elements.Source: See [6, 7].be obtained from the environment. Other essential inorganic chemicals besidescatalysts are also required for the stability of cells, and we describe these below.All of the elements had to be selected initially from among those most available inthe prevailing primitive environmental conditions (probably somewhat acidic witha high content of H2S). From analysis, the total basic list of the necessary elementsfor all forms of life, and therefore for the emergence of life, we deduce to be C, H, N,O, S, P, Se, (Cl), (Na), K, Mg, (Ca), (Mn), Fe,{Zn}, and probably a little Ni, Co, V,and W (see Table21.3)[6, 7]. We know of life only in which the vast majority, if notall, of these elements are present. The elements in parentheses (M) are at lower freeconcentrations in cells than in the environment because they were largely rejected.The requirement for Zn, shown in braces, is uncertain. The reasons for this “natural”selection of the elements are known [6, 7]; here we will limit ourselves to passingcomments. The selection is dependent on binding constants of the available metalelements to organic molecules that conform in fact to well-defined sequences, e.g.the Irving–Williams series, as most of these interactions come to equilibrium [7, 9]and on the functional capacity of the resultant complexes.The organic molecules in cells are mainly anionic. Sodium, as Na+, cannot beallowed to neutralize these negative charges of the non-metal compounds insidecells because its external concentration (in the sea) is too high (10−1m) and itsentry would result in too great a cellular osmotic pressure. For this reason, Cl−alsohad to be largely rejected. Instead, potassium, K+,isselected for the uptake into thecytoplasm. Neither of these cations binds to organic molecules. Calcium, as Ca2+,isalso deleterious inside cells because at its environmental concentration (10−3m)it"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"21 Evolution revisited by inorganic chemists463binds to many negative centers and forms gels or precipitates with them. Manganese,as Mn2+, competes easily with Mg2+, which is necessary inside cells to neutralizenegative charge and to act as a structuring element or as a catalyst. Mg is loweredin concentration in the cytoplasm. (Note that Mg is also indispensable for the cellenergetic processes; ATP should be written Mg–ATP.) The need to neutralize chargeis, as stated, due to the fact that, on average, the biological polymers and substratesare negatively charged because they have groups that at pH 7 are deprotonated,e.g. carboxylate and phosphate. The last element, in braces above, is Zn. Its verylow presence or absence in the primitive cells was due to its very low availabilityfrom its sulfide (see below). Cells cannot tolerate high concentrations of this or anyfree-transition-metal ions M2+as they would compete for useful Mg2+and Fe2+sites, but such concentrations were unlikely initially because of the insolubility oftheir sulfides [7].Iron and magnesium are the preferred catalysts in primordial organisms; bothwere abundant and available (although Fe forms a slightly insoluble sulfide, italso gives soluble Fe/S clusters). Mg2+became the major ion for condensationand Fe2+the major ion for redox processes. Note that iron binds preferentially toNand S donors, such as amines and thiolates, whereas Mg binds to O donors,such as carboxylates and phosphates. Thus, given their concentrations, they can becomplexed selectively. Iron can then be used for redox catalyses and magnesiumfor acid–base catalyses. Apparently, vanadium (V) and tungsten (W) also playedan important role as catalysts in primitive or slightly later biological chemistry(V in the nitrogenase of bacteria and W in redox processes occurring espe-cially in extremophile Archaea). They were both displaced when Mo was lib-erated from its sulfide in aerobic conditions. Although Ni and Co are of lowabundance and form rather insoluble sulfides, they occur in today’s bacteria andArchaea in catalysts of reactions involving H2,CH4, CO, and CH3. Their presencein primitive organisms may have been due to more acidic environmental condi-tions where their sulfides are more soluble. Table21.4summarizes the roles ofthe elements, which relate to the minimal set required for primordial life (Table21.2). Note the absence of copper and the very small amounts of zinc in primitiveanaerobes.Of course, the relative concentrations of all these elements in the cell cytoplasmhad to be controlled. Therefore, some had to be captured and some rejected, byusing a variety of processes, including pumping, which requires energy, Mg–ATP, orproton gradients. In part, this control is managed through the genetic machinery, butit also involves simple questions of chemical equilibrium, e.g., stability constants ofcomplexes, solubility products of salts, etc., which are not related to genes [6, 7, 9].The intimate link to the environment, source of materials, and energy is obvious inall these cases.

These substances acted not just as active agents, butas messengers to maintain an “informed system” (see “Information” below). Mostimportant of all controls linked to energy and material uses is Mg–NTP, where Nis a nucleotide, e.g. Mg–ATP.For many purposes, the simple metal ions Mg2+and Fe2+are not ideal becausethey exchange too easily from complexes. Again, nickel and cobalt are not eas-ily incorporated into cells, given the insolubility of their sulfides, which increasedas the seas approached neutral pH. An advantageous development was the syn-thesis of organic molecules capable of incorporating a few metal ions in irre-versible processes. Once so incorporated, the metal ions do not exchange, so that thespecies formed behave effectively as new “metals,” different from those that weresequestered. The main molecules of this kind were the porphyrins, all derived fromuroporphyrin. The metals so incorporated were Mg (in chlorophyll), Fe (in heme),and small amounts of Co (in cobalamin) and Ni (in the F-430 factor). All haveconsiderable thermodynamic and kinetic stability and do not equilibrate with thefree-metal ions. One of these complexes, chlorophyll, enabled the capture of solarradiation, a new source of energy, and then the development of photosynthesis [10].It is this photosynthesis, using H2Otogivehydrogen and rejecting dioxygen andaided by Fe and Mn enzymes, that forced evolution. Such photosynthesis arose, weconsider, in an inevitable drive toward optimal energy capture in steady states (see“Steady states and final conditions” below), supposing life started using chemicalenergy trapped in inorganic chemicals during earth’s formation. (Note that someFe/S centers are also formed irreversibly, but others can exchange Fe.)Externally, calcium and manganese are the major active elements; the first, ini-tially a poison, became one of the most important biological elements, as we willstress later, and the second, bound on the outer surface of the membrane, gave access"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"21 Evolution revisited by inorganic chemists465to the production of free molecular oxygen, O2, from water in the photosynthesisprocess, which changed the nature of life and of the environment, i.e. of the wholeearth’s ecosystem.A feature of these first, and all subsequent, organisms is that they live in and are“informed” by external gradients of different kinds – gravitational, magnetic, andchemical [8]–as well as by internal feedback loops. The chemical gradients arepartly self-generated because as the cells take in chemicals they create a loweredconcentration around themselves. Again, the very act of creating a cell membranewith the discharge of other ions produces an electrical gradient, particularly of Na+,K+,Cl−, and Ca2+. Disturbances of any of these gradients are a potential sourceof information about the outside environment, and if they can be recognized thecell can search the environment by swimming to advantage. It is then a matter ofhow the sensing of the environment is connected to the cell’s physico-chemicalapparatus. The connection in prokaryotes is very largely to the synthesis of codedsensor units, proteins. Once the proteins are in place, the cell is informed by thegradients and need not refer to the DNA for immediate response.Weshall see that a major step in evolution concerns DNA indirectly, but is directlylinked to this metabolic awareness of the environment and the ability to respond.Bacteria respond to chemicals, food gradients, through a special messenger in thecytoplasm – production of c-AMP – but not to these ionic gradients. They showchemotaxis, but have little other sense of the environment; for example, they cannotalter their shape. Their life cycle is short, and energy is overwhelmingly directedto reproduction.Note that in this primordial biological chemistry some fifteen elements are essen-tial, but the list does not include metals that became progressively important, espe-cially molybdenum and copper, which form insoluble sulfides and so were notavailable initially. Availability changed as sulfide was oxidiyed and water supplieduseful hydrogen but waste oxygen.The road to unicellular eukaryotesWhen oxidizing conditions developed, access to many essential non-metals andmetals alike diminished, while others became available (see Figure21.3). Carbonwasnowonly present as CO2,hydrogen as H2O, nitrogen as N2, sulfur as sulfate,and so on among non-metals. Now, apart from these changes, many sulfides wereoxidized to soluble sulfates to give increasingly available, but poisonous, Zn2+,Cu2+,Co2+,Ni2+, and molybdate, which organisms had not met in quantity before.Among metals, iron was oxidized to Fe3+and precipitated as Fe(OH)3.Inthecytoplasm, new metabolic paths were therefore essential (see [6, 7]).

Slowly, the nature of the environment changed, from reducing tooxidizing, and the cell’s internal cytoplasmic chemistry became therefore evenmore reducing relative to the environment because, as stated, the fixed reduction isimperative to enable the synthesis of the biological polymers.How could the extant, simple, anaerobic, unicellular organisms survive andreproduce in such conditions? From what we observe, the answer is straightforward:many of them did not and died; some found shelter in anoxic niches where theycould be (and still are) viable; othersadaptedto the prevailing oxidizing conditions,which required considerable changes; and, finally, other cells underwent dramaticchange. Our thesis is thatorganisms had to evolve in a particular chemical way,forced by the new environmental conditions. They could evolve in two ways: byadaptation to give aerobic prokaryotes or by radical change to aerobic eukaryotes.Wehave described the change to aerobic bacteria elsewhere [6, 7]; here we wishto stress why and how the eukaryotes arose and led to huge ramifications, as seen"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"21 Evolution revisited by inorganic chemists467Table 21.5.Levels of self-organizationA.

Note that the anaerobic and aerobic prokaryotes did not disappear,but gradually became deeply involved in a total ecosystem (see below). In fact,as stressed in reference [1], all species have developed during evolution to somedegree, but our interest is not with them in particular. Rather, it is in the overalldevelopment of an ecosystem with new types of cellular organization arising to meetnew environment conditions more effectively within them, although in other ways,e.g., rate of reproduction, they were at a disadvantage. Much of this disadvantageis overcome by symbiosis.Themajor necessary strategyof eukaryotes to reconcile a reductive cell’s cyto-plasm with an oxidizing environment was the development of new membranesand compartments separated from the cytoplasm inside cells and where oxidizingchemistry could take place (Table21.5)[6, 7]. (Such a compartment outside thecytoplasm is also the periplasmic space between the internal and the external mem-branes, seen in aerobic bacteria.) Vesicles inside cells probably originated frominvagination of the new external membranes, incidentally inverting all their pumpsso that their contents became similar to the external environment relative to thecytoplasm. For example, they have high concentrations of Ca2+,Na+,Mn2+, and"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"468R. J. P. Williams and J. J. R. Fra ́usto da SilvaCl−,aswell as other oxidized chemical species that were hardly available beforethe emergence of oxygen, such as bound Zn2+and then Cu+/Cu2+,but low concen-trations of K+,Fe2+, and Mg2+.Inaddition, the rejection of Ca2+to the environmentand then to internal compartments allowed the formation of, for example, organizedcalcium carbonate to be used in external skeletons (as in coccoliths). The exportof Ca2+and Zn2+enzymes enabled acid–base hydrolytic digestion not only outsidecells, but more generally in vesicles.It is important to note that one apparently essential change that occurred tothe primitive unicellular, eukaryote anaerobic organisms was the incorporation ofcholesterol, especially in their outer cell membranes [7]. Cholesterol is a product ofthe oxidation of squalene derivatives, giving the membranes greater strength so thatthey could do without a wall, but yet through greater flexibility could allow vesicleformation within them and, generally, enlargement of a cell. The evolution of per-sistent internal filaments, the changed membranes, and the loss of cell walls allowedthe increase in size of such organisms and also the first possibility of synergismthrough the engulfing and incorporation in metabolism of smaller organisms –bacteria, leading to the formation of cellular organelles – mitochondria (from amethanogenic bacterium) and chloroplasts (from a cyanobacterium). These devel-opments utilized the flexibility of the cell membrane. Each of these organelles hasaDNAdifferent from that found today in its host (the nuclear DNA), evidence oftheir separate origin and elaboration of control [11]. In effect, the organelles arejust symbiotic compartments in an enlarged organization [4] (see also [19]).Of course, the creation of more compartments in one organization implies thesimultaneous development of a new network of messengers, such that the entirecellular chemistry functions harmoniously (see Table21.5and reference [12]).One major new messenger is Ca2+from the environment, which can be used inthe cytoplasm in only brief impulses, given its tendency to bind rather stronglyat high concentration to other essential chemicals, blocking their action. Calcium-containing vesicles became a kind of accessory “condenser” in these electrolyticcircuits, controlling a series of processes linked especially to the use of chemicalenergy in the form of Mg–ATP, namely mechanical processes such as the tensionof internal filaments that maintain and adjust the cell’s shape and the compart-ments in place, and the motion of cilia and fiber contraction. Another importantmessenger is internal, cyclic AMP, synthesized in bacteria and linked to such pro-cesses as sensing food, which now became a calcium-controlled process. Calciumand various other organic phosphates, often in coupled systems, came to be usedgenerally to inform the cell of the environment, thereby gaining a great advan-tage for cell survival. Note that the rejection of calcium by bacteria generatedthe message possibility, but without a receiver for it (see below). Their short life"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"21 Evolution revisited by inorganic chemists469made such information transfer of little use. In evolution, DNA increased in size asone source of information, but sensors increased information from the environment.The calcium cell sensors act on metabolism in fast response, independently of DNAresponse. This leads eventually to the development of the phenotype (see below).Wemake the general statement thatactivity of organisms is increasingly linked toinformation from the environment whereas information in the gene dominates repro-duction,but we need to discover how the two became interactive (see “Information”below).Simultaneously with these developments, the cellular DNA became positionedbehind an internal separate membrane (the nuclear membrane), which ensuredhigher protection and stability. In effect, a new compartment was created in whichthe DNA became progressively associated with a series of proteins, the histones,in a more compact structure. The “reading” of this code obviously became a saferbutfar more complicated process because the parts to be “read” demand that theyare exposed to the reading machinery. As the DNA is exposed and unfolds, it hasa higher local vulnerability and, consequently, mutation rate. The DNA was nowsplit into reading (exons) and non-reading (introns) frames. At the same time, newtranscription factors and messengers in the cytoplasm arose. We note particularly theincreasing use of zinc in zinc fingers. We will come to these aspects of evolutionlater, but note that this gross evolutionary process to more complex organismswas indeed enforced by the presence of an oxidized environment and directedby the environmental changes, for example of available zinc. It was not just theaccidental consequence of random mutations, as much as these are required tocreate the synthesis to match this environment. But were even the mutations, infact, to some degree directed? (See the discussions of epigenetic possibilities in[13, 14].)Wemay therefore say that the evolution from prokaryotes to eukaryotes wasachieved through: (1) the creation of new flexible membranes; (2) the developmentof internal compartments, including the separate nucleus; (3) the development ofinternal persistent filament structures; (4) the use of oxidizing chemical processesand new elements in cells and particularly in vesicles (note especially copper andzinc released from their sulfides); (5) the use of new messengers to ensure com-munication between all component compartments, including the environment, theessence of organization; and (6) the beginnings of synergism (symbiosis) betweendifferent organisms. These changes propelled vertical evolution (Table21.1), butthey did not stop at unicellular organisms because considerable advantages in mat-erial and energy capture result in multicellular eukaryotes. However, they have thedisadvantage of great complexity, and their existence came to depend on unicellularorganisms in direct or indirect symbiosis."},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"470R. J. P.

These two develop-ments of multicellular organisms also of necessity involved much greater orga-nization. We saw that complexity of a cell had generally increased in unicellular"},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"21 Evolution revisited by inorganic chemists471eukaryotes, but it was alleviated by effectively combining cells with internal bacte-ria, the organelles. In this way, organisms were effectively multicellular, using theorganelles, mitochondria, and chloroplasts to supply energy, while the cytoplasmmanaged most synthesis and uptake of chemicals. Multicellular eukaryotes evolvedfurther to generate individual cell (and organ) specialization by differentiation andgrowth, alleviating complexity to a further degree in any particular cell. This evolu-tion on a large scale used many of the novel features of unicellular eukaryotes, butwith the introduction of new constructs including cell–cell binding, extra sensingof the environment, and new external and internal (cell–cell) messengers – all, ofcourse, dependent on parallel development at the DNA level for controlled repro-duction and production of proteins. The organisms required relatively rigid externalfilament structures to hold cells together, in positions; this can be achieved onlythroughoxidized cross-linking of polymers. The earliest cross-linking chemistry inplants used free-radical reactions with the participation of O2or H2O2, mainly inenzymes binding Fe-protoporphyrins, and rejected manganese (in peroxidases andligninases). Remember that the organisms now depended on lower organisms formany chemical elements.Very similar peroxidases are used by plants to break connective tissue and allowgrowth. This particular procedure is not safe in animal growth because of the riskof mutation and cell migration, and we find that cross-linking is mostly bycopperenzymes(oxidases) in extracellular fluids, not by using radicals, to produce, inparticular, collagen in animals. On the other hand, zinc acquired new essentialfunctions, such as external hydrolysis of collagenases, elastases, etc. to disruptexternal filamentous structures so as to allow growth, migration, and reassemblingof animal cells. Such changes were possible only through the extended use ofthese newly available elements: zinc first, and later copper, coinciding – one billionyears ago – with the oxidation of their sulfides (Table21.6). Simultaneously, newexternal chemical messengers arose to allow cell–cell communication and maintainthe coordinated control and organization of the system.These messengers were now organic compounds, hormones, and other sub-stances, including transmitters, again largely produced by oxidative processes. Notethat the simple ion messengers – phosphate, calcium, magnesium, and iron – werealready used, so that to avoid confusion such organic messengers had to be calledinto use. Those such as adrenaline and amidated peptides were synthesized in vesi-cles by usingcopper enzymes. They acted on the outside of cells and connectedacross the cell membrane through calcium pulses, whereas those such as sterolsconnected to zinc transcription factors directly in the cell. In the oxidative processes,we stress the relevance of iron (heme) and copper in the production, reception, anddestruction of such organic messengers in both plants and animals.

Now increased protection was needed againstO2and its reduction products, O−2,H2O2, and OH·, which are even more active.For this purpose, superoxide dismutase (first in prokaryotes Fe and Mn, or Ni, butnote later in eukaryotes the safer Cu/Zn enzyme), catalase, and free-radical (OH·)scavengers emerged. These very reagents also became used in protection againstinvasive organisms and chemicals, especially heme and peroxides in plant andanimal immune vesicle systems. Again, the new possibility of introducing oxidizedstates of selenium alone or selenium and iodine generated further protection, and thesynthesis, with heme iron, of the thyroid hormones (see their oxidation/reductionpotentials in Figure21.3).In the opposite sense, the involvement of H2,CH4, CO, etc., present in primitiveatmospheres, became of little value as these gases were oxidized away.

J. P. Williams and J. J. R. Fra ́usto da Silvaof an ozone layer that filtered the noxious UV radiation from the sun. This occurredsome 500 million years ago (see Figure21.4). Before this, life may have beenpossible only in the sea or perhaps in niches well protected from UV radiation.In the development that ensued – which required greater and greater organiza-tion in multicellular organisms (see Table21.4)–wewish to draw attention to theincreasing interdependence and the development of necessary cooperation betweenchemotypes (positive synergism) to overcome the problems of organization. Ani-mals became dependent on plants (and bacteria) for diverse essential products, andplants became dependent on bacteria, for example for nitrogen fixation. The gen-eral rule is that as complexity increases it is better to delegate different functionsto separate compartments to increase efficiency and to avoid confusion. Divisionof labor is the rule – the biosphere is then essentially cooperative, even thoughsimilar species may be in competition. Modern industrial plants are based on asimilar principle. Adam Smith in hisThe Wealth of Nations(1776) was adamantin this respect; we could say that his view had a clear biological basis. The naiveapproach to the “survival of the fittest” among species cannot be looked on in thisway because it refers to species of similar kinds. The survival of the most com-plex in an ecosystem is perhaps curiously dependent on the presence of the leastcomplex, and individual fitness of species is not relevant. We may well believe thatglobalization of human organizations in a cooperative way is the solution to manyills by removing competition.Development of effective use of energy and resources is one aspect of divisionof activity into separate units in space, but they must be coordinated in each ani-mal and as far as possible in groups of animals. Coordination requires greater andgreater reliance on information transfer. Clearly, animals have increasingly linkedactivity to information from the environment, more so than plants, while the DNAinformation dominated reproduction only. In very large animals, this informationtransfer had to be fast as they had to scavenge quickly and had to protect them-selves, and a new way of conveying information appeared in the form of a nervoussystem. This system linked distant cells in multicellular animals by cooperativeelectrolytic messages. Note that the conducting ions are Na+,K+,Cl−, and some-times Ca2+. Their gradients were created in the original prokaryote form of life,butfast transmission of messages became of value only when large mobile organ-isms developed. Coordination of muscles and senses by nerves was then critical.Na+and K+are ineffective as binding agents, but produce a cooperative voltageswitch, not an individual relay of ions, to affect organic message systems by way ofCa2+input, so they had no value until they could be coupled to Ca2+and organicmessengers. By themselves, they do not carry information (see below).The senses evolved with the development of touching, seeing, hearing, andsmelling. The nerves, in turn, had to be co-ordinated, and we see the rapid"},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"21 Evolution revisited by inorganic chemists475development of the brain, totally dependent on the above electrolytic currents.An end-product of this evolution was humankind. In passing, note how step afterstep in evolution is linked to either the introduction of novel elements, elementsin novel oxidation states, or just to new uses of elements – i.e. basic inorganicchemistry. It is useful to see evolution as the inevitable introduction of new, butdependent, chemotypes in an unavoidable chemical sequence.HumankindThe final step of this vertical evolution – until now – was the emergence twentymillion years ago of hominids, which developed into the modern human beings.Obviously, human beings are “higher” animals, but they have a particularly stronglyevolved nervous system with a self-conscious brain, capable of storing vastly more“information” than all other organisms and of using it as a kind of second code,quite different from DNA. It differs in that it uses information stores of extensive,concentration-dependent properties of something approaching twenty moleculesand ions instead of the intensive, concentration-independent four symbols in linearDNA.Information is handed down by copying. The man is father to the child pheno-typically, and this succession is open to rapid innovation, unlike the functioning ofDNA, as it is increased generation on generation and not by species change. Thus,although not reproduced, the knowledge in the brain can be inherited and givesincreased knowledge in humankind’s evolution by a different method: recordingand transmission. The response of the brain is fast and relates to the environmentalinformation, not to the reproductive information in DNA. The functioning of thebrain can be understood only in systems language and not in that of molecularstructures; compare, for example, the shapes of clouds [22].Weshall not elaborate on this topic here because the chemistry of the brain isscarcely known [15]. The brain processes the information and reacts accordingly,sending instructions through nerves and then transmitters produced by glands thatlink to the calcium network. It is also curious to note that the brain is immersed in aspecial protective fluid – the cerebrospinal fluid – the composition of which differssomewhat from the other external body biological fluids [7, 15]. The form in whichthe human brain works requires a quite new approach to the use of energy and theenvironment in the chemistry associated with organisms.The big change humankind has made is that through an understanding of physicsand chemistry, stored in the brain, we are now able to manipulate extensively the useof the environmental resources. We not only tap the full range of use of the chemicalelements available on earth – all 92 (see Figure21.2)–but can carry out synthesesin compartments outside cells and can employ energy from new sources. We are a"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"476R. J. P. Williams and J. J. R. Fra ́usto da Silvaquite new chemotype. The development of massive external activities in industryis resulting in the redistribution of elements (and chemicals) in quite a novel way.Humankind has also initiated all kinds of transport and message systems that useunique equipment. An addition to this activity is the computer, an extra informationprocessor; but note that information in a computer is quantized: intensive, as inDNA, and not extensive, as in the brain. We detail these changes elsewhere [6, 7].Finally, humans can manipulate DNA so that the information network internal toall cells is also open to exploitation. Although we may say that this is not biologicalevolution, in effect it is exactly so if, instead of basing our view of evolutionon DNA, or genetic changes in species of organisms, we show how systems ofmaterials energized from outside advance in chemotype organization. We analyzethis possibility below in “Steady states and final conditions.”Looking to the futureSo far in this chapter, we have described the evolution of chemotypes from protocellsto humankind. Before we look more directly at the present situation and the possiblefuture, as far as we can see it as a progression of evolution, we summarize our thesisas follows.Any system will advance toward optimal use of all the components, energy, andmaterial that can be incorporated into the system toward a final state that can nolonger evolve unless the environment changes. The implication is that no matterwhat the system is, in the end it exploits its accessible resources to the full, includingits early waste. The timing of evolution of organisms is unknowable, but its generalnature is determinate and inevitable in chemotypes because of the basic reductivechemistry essential for the origin of life and its waste (oxygen) – and despite theproblems associated with the random nature of species [1].In evolution, seen in this ecological geochemical–biochemical fashion, the lim-itation can be that not all materials that enter the system can become fully incor-porated. We saw this in the case of the effect of oxygen that generated metal ionsin the environment, such as cadmium, lead, and mercury, none of which has abiological use and all of which are toxic. The activities of humans could also leadto an environment with chemical elements or chemicals not compatible with thenature of life, and we must take care to prevent such damaging effects. In the nextsections, we look briefly at this concern and those of the two other main strandsin our description of evolution: possible energy and organizational (information)changes. We shall then make a final summary.The influence of the environmentThe influence of the (inorganic) environment in all life processes is so extensiveand so clear that it is indeed surprising to see that many texts concerning biological"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"21 Evolution revisited by inorganic chemists477evolution omit it. Even more surprising is to see that this still happens in timeswhen ecological concerns have become so widespread and “preservation” of theenvironment is a major political issue. Everyone agrees that the “deterioration” ofthe environment affects living organisms, among which are vulnerable, dependentspecies.What can be asked is how new environmental changes caused by humankind,such as the introduction into the environment of newly available elements, canaffect future evolutionary steps. Recent examples of disturbances – acid rain, thegreenhouse effect, the ozone hole, photochemical fog, radioactive wastes, etc. –show that they can affect the environment in many ways. Acid rain, for example,can erode clays and release aluminum, which is transported to rivers and lakes,becoming a permanent component of the aquatic media at lower pH. How willaquatic organisms react to the presence of a new toxic element in their habitat?The answer is always the same – history here repeats itself. Many organisms willnot survive and species will become extinct; some will hide in protected niches(difficult to imagine in this case); and others will adapt to the new conditions and intime will make use of the new element. As history shows, the trend is: toxic elementrejection→messenger of risk→incorporation→utilization (metabolism, newstructures, new messengers, new forms to obtain energy). As we see it historically,this has driven evolution in the exploitation of elements such as calcium, sodium,copper, zinc, and even chlorine. To take advantage, the evolution of DNA mustfollowin a step-wise succession. DNA is a code and not a direct determinant.The important and timely question is whether a selfish species such as ours iswilling to take steps to avoid the potential risks of the extremely rapid change inenvironmental composition, a duel between “matter” and “mind” – that is, betweenthe struggle to satisfy the basic animal needs of food, shelter, defense, and repro-duction, to which humankind adds comfort and pleasure, and reason and goodcommon sense, which impose caution and restraint. Once there is no doubt aboutthe balance that must be achieved, we will be better prepared; but this requires muchpublic scientific education and awareness. All life is not at risk – it has never beenin almost four billion years – but the human species may disappear unless it adaptsto the new prevailing conditions. In time, it could be that a different chemotypesurvives toward a final cyclic steady state (see below).Evolution of energy sourcesAt this stage of our account of evolution, we have described the way in which pastand future changes in availability of the elements in the environment, which couldbe put to use, have changed the nature of living systems internally and externally(outside cells), with an ever-increasing efficiency of use of energy and elements inever-more complex organization. The sequence arose through the effect of “waste”"},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"478R. J. P. Williams and J. J. R. Fra ́usto da Silva(oxygen) from organisms. In essence, in this biological evolution, organisms usedonly those available energy sources that could be applied directly to internal chemi-cal changes, namely to create non-equilibrated chemicals using internally the energyof the crust of the earth and light from the sun. We need to stress that with the comingof intelligent human beings, additional potential extra sources of energy have beenrecognized, as have materials for storing it, now that we understand that energyis a resource. Untouched until humankind arrived was, for example, the energy ofthe non-equilibrated nuclear abundances on earth. Now, two nuclear projects areunder development: fission and fusion. Humankind has also realized that biologicalevolution lost a great amount of carbon and hydrogen in its own debris – coal, oil,and much of natural gas – which was then not easily incorporated into organisms.These chemicals are the bases of modern fuels. Again, energy can be captured byhumankind’s devices from gravitational fields (river waters and tidal power) andtemperature gradients (air and sea currents). Some of these uses are perhaps risky,but the drive of evolution will always be toward the optimal use of all availablesources of energy as well as of all available elements. We must realize that there isan end-point to this evolution quite separate from the risks of material waste, whichcould send it backward. The increase of energy use is linked to heat production,and in turn this is linked to temperature change. A very high temperature may notallow eukaryote life.Weshall now describe the limit to which energy and materials can be exploitedto optimize a flow system.Steady states and final conditionsLet us now return to the driving force of evolution as we see it. A basic diagram(see Figure21.1)exists for all systems that absorb energy. They generate heat whileinducing patterns of flow into the objects absorbing the radiation. Many physicalexamples may be given, including the formation of winds, sea currents, clouds,and rivers. The chemicals irradiated will also be forced into energized flow condi-tions as they release energy as heat. The flows are driven by the overall increaseof thermal entropy as small numbers of large energy quanta (light) become manysmall energy quanta (heat), but a certain amount of order and/or of organization iscreated. Such a system could become completely cyclic, and in such a condition itwill have absorbed energy optimally and created the greatest degree of organiza-tion, not order [6, 16, 22]. Such a cyclic system, like an equilibrium state, cannotevolve, although it will also create a re-occurring or reproductive form. The flowarises from the environmental chemicals, (A). A second possibility, however, isthat the flow only enters a steady state and produces material waste (B) not initiallyinvolved in the cycle Energy+Material (A)→Return Flow+Waste (B)+Heat."},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"21 Evolution revisited by inorganic chemists479This general state of the interaction of energy and material in a system was inevitableon earth 3.5×109years ago; the system still exists today, but in a new organiza-tion because of biological evolution. As waste builds, the environment is changed.Therefore, the system can evolve with the new environment as it adapts or changesto use it. In fact, it is the only way it can evolve unless new energy or new mat-erials are introduced in other fashions. Let us assume that no new energy sourceis possible. Thus, if the waste (B) is by its very nature interactive either with (A)or with the process producing flow, then the system evolves as the environment,(A) + (B) + subsequent products of reactions of (A) + (B), evolves. It becomes anevolving ecosystem that inevitably struggles to become fully cyclic, the end-pointof any evolution other than the collapse of energy supply when the system revertstoward equilibrium. (Evolution is dependent on the energy of the sun, and the sun’scollapse will destroy life on earth.)Next we must recognize that several different products of such a system as(A) + (B) + energy may exist. They are not strictly reproducible unless the flowsare organized by a central control system, say DNA. We will then see the changingenvironment – new inorganic chemistry, as described above – as forcing organizedbiological evolution toward optimal energy capture and in altered organized flow.The DNA is forced to change. Now the nature of (B) and its products can be bestdeveloped by increasing use of compartments and informed activity, including mes-sage systems. The compartments keep incompatible, but useful, chemical reactionsseparate as they become newly available. However, do not forget that this enforce-ment is due to the very nature of the early steps of energy-capture by chemicals,whether abiotic or biotic, controlled largely by genes until eukaryotes developed,when the environment became more and more a source of information that could bestored in the brain and used externally. Eventually, this led to quite new chemicaland energy sources being used by humankind and quite a new possibility for acontrol command over all life, but the end-point remains clear.Weturn next to look at information transfer, which is necessary if we are tounderstand organization of energy and material input in systems and the way theyhave developed and can develop further. This is a further limitation on evolution.InformationIn biological chemistry, “information” [5]isaterm usually restricted to the potentialinstructions stored in the coded sequence of the four nucleotides of DNA. In ouropinion, this is too limited a view of what information is and of the kinds ofinformation effectively used in biological chemistry (see [5, 12, 14, 17, 18]). To openthe discussion, we require a comprehensive definition of “information,” not an easytask because it is an elusive concept. Looking into dictionaries or encyclopedias for"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"480R. J. P. Williams and J. J. R. Fra ́usto da Silvaaproper definition is of little use because these definitions are restricted to particularcases, such as “that conveyed in the spoken communication between two persons”or, in computer programs, “represented by a particular arrangement of numbers orsymbols.” In a more general operational definition, other factors or agents must beconsidered. These assume both the existence of an energized source of information(the sender) and the recognition of the message (information) by a receiver, but wecan only tell that the receiver has been informed if it acts as a consequence, againusing energy. Information is only in the message in an “informed system” and doesnot arise directly just from the DNA sequence or the flows from or to the donor orreceiver – they do not alone create change in the system. (Note that the dictionarydefinition involves only people. People can interpret DNA because they know how toread its sequence, but the cell cannot. To read its sequence, the cell needs metabolitesand proteins to interact with the DNA. The cell also receives proteins from the DNA,generating reactions – that is, metabolism changes. We see that DNA actually isjust a part of an informed cell system.) Let us start again from a definition.Wecan see that an “informed system” is more readily defined as a system with anenergized receiver that has the capability to react to a stimulus from a message sentby an energized source. The message as information is described only in terms ofproperties of the whole sequence – donor, message, receiver – which uses energy.Forsimplicity, let us start considering systems not involving living organisms,butthat are abiotic and are not informed. Consider the sun, the earth, and thepresent oxygenated atmosphere. The sun as a source of radiation sends out energyin part captured by the receiver, atmospheric molecular oxygen, O2,and so createsthe cyclic steady balance3O22O3(not an equilibrium); but note that oxygenresponds only to that fraction of radiation for which it has electronic transitions.On reacting, O2forms ozone, O3,which is heavier than oxygen and more attractedby the earth’s gravity field, so that it falls toward the earth. Ozone, through theeffect of a different radiation, decomposes back to oxygen, a lighter molecule.The process is repeated again and again until a cyclic steady state is eventuallyreached. The gravity field generated by earth maintains the relative positions ofO2and O3so that a persistent confined ozone layer is created by it and by a UVgradient at a sufficiently low temperature and height. We can therefore say that theO2/O3flow systemis formedby direct interaction both with the energy suppliedby the sun in the form of radiation and with the gravity field of the earth, whichtogether have a structuring function on O2/O3flow. We see immediately that allenergy or material gradients can interact to cause flow and then generate a formedsystem. Other formed systems are the clouds in the sky, the planetary system, andthe meanderings of rivers. Life must have started from such very low-level abioticformed chemical flows, but we do not call such systemsinformedbecause all thecomponents are separate parts of the systems’ activity."},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"21 Evolution revisited by inorganic chemists481Information is not required in forming a system, but acts between two or moreformed systems, donors and receivers, to create a higher level of activity in thereceiver with the “demand” transferred from the donor. Consider a cell. All of usagree that the DNA is for us a coded form of information when acting as a donor,butbyitself it is meaningless in a cell. It therefore requires information and inter-pretation (reading) and becomes informative when it gives an energized message tothe directed flow of energy or material, for example into the metabolic synthesis ofnew DNA and/or RNA. The sender of this information is the polymerase system +DNA + energy, and the message is in the sequence of monomer bases after beingread. The polymerase reads out the DNA code (also a message) and the new mes-sage formed is messenger RNA (mRNA). In the next step, mRNA is translatedas proteins, which the ribosomal machinery and energy plus this RNA create as afurther message to be passed to substrates.The proteins, with energy, act as catalysts in the cytoplasm in metabolic events.Thus, the proteins are carriers involved in information to the primary smallmolecules leading with energy to products of a guided kind. Continuing down thechain, the primary products have arisen in part by diffusion, together with pumpingof material from outside the cell. The internal metabolism is thus constrained ina selected way by the environment, the membrane, and, distantly, the DNA. Theenvironment is now an equal participant in information, but from the outside of thecell, causing it to start intake or not, also according to its content, while the cyto-plasm allows intake, or restricts it, according to its content, both by the membrane.The whole, environment and metabolizing chemicals/DNA(RNA), is an interactingnetwork.Now let us work up the same chain of events. The environment supplies basicmaterials and energy. The resultant internal concentrations of substrates and laterproteins can act directly on uptake mechanisms by generating or stopping activity,initiated at DNA, of scavenger or pump molecules. They can also stop initiationby binding to the DNA synthesis machinery through transcription factors. At thesame time, other transcription factors influence the RNA machinery through theconcentrations of synthesized substrates of many kinds, switching protein synthesison or off. Finally, active proteins, in one metabolic path of a substrate – or evenin a path in which this substrate is not involved – are informed by feedback flowfrom the substrate concentrations so as to stop or start catalysis. In a sense, thedonors of information have become the receivers of it in a loop. We see that thewhole cellular organization is criss-crossed by signals linked to the environment aswell as to DNA. In fact, cells and the environment have been increasingly knittedinto one organization [19, 22], which includes all the elements and structures in theenvironment, as the amount of interaction with the outside has increased with timein the more organized organisms."},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"482R.

Examples start from the chemotacticgradients in prokaryotes and increase with the calcium gradients in single-celledeukaryotes, then the organic messengers and hormones in multicellular eukaryotes(see Table21.7), then the Na+/K+gradients in the nervous system of animals, etc.These gradients across membranes act on receiver proteins built by cells codedby DNA. The genome plus the cell activity guided by external inputs poses avery difficult problem for the description of cooperative activity of organisms.The messenger activities are a systematic, not a random, advance following theenvironmental sequence of changes and the potential consequences [22].Two further complications arise. Sending messages from the DNA through RNAthrough proteins to metabolism is slow. Sending of messages from the environmentto the metabolism is fast. The more the cells sense the environment quickly, the"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"21 Evolution revisited by inorganic chemists483more their behavior depends on the external environment, and the more they reactto it rapidly. A major progression in evolution is speed of response. More and more,this helps survival despite the slow reproduction rate. As information concerningthe environment increases, so the environment itself can be used to influence theorganism, and the organism can react in turn in an effort to control its environment.(Note that survival, reproduction, diversification, etc. are all forms of ensuring thepersistence of life, a particular mechanism to degrade energy.)Tothis view of informed systems we must add the influence of the brain, whichis clearly a store of information based on genes only for its initial very incompleteformation. We may look on this curious malleable organ in the following way.The genetic apparatus generates a vast bundle of neurons, perhaps 100 billion ofthem, in no particular overall connected array, although some localized regions aredifferent from others. It has very little information – that is, contact with itself or theenvironment. This “jumble” is connected to the sense organs, from which it receivesinformation very quickly about physical or chemical conditions in the environmentthat help it to build images. The neurons then grow to make contacts with otherneurons connected to other body parts and so organize possible responses. A largeincrease of brain capacity arises by making a complex network of contacts thatreflect, in a coded form, the distribution in four dimensions of outside events. Asaresult, images are created that persist. The organism associates these imageswith other sensory impacts that relate to food, danger, etc. and acts accordingly.The coded information in this case is not like that in systems based on computersor in the DNA code. Unlike DNA, the brain is connected to the entire historicalfeatures of the organism’s life through the further functional connections of thenerves to glands, organs, and so on down to all cells through chemical bindingsand growth, much independent of DNA. Connections are not all or none (binary1or0), but are based on quantitative extensive properties: concentration, bindingstrength, and local dynamic structure. The whole malleable brain is not fixed atbirth and develops through all of life. This is found increasingly in animals up tohumankind. Moreover, from the knowledge humankind has gathered, ways havebeen found of expressing information as output in the form of language – spoken,written, computerized, etc. Information (now in the dictionary sense), which isnot in DNA, is then passed down through generations, making today’s societypossible.The resultant activity is in partscientific informationapplied to all kinds ofmaterial and energy resources, but it is only a vast development of the increasinginvolvement of the environment with organisms throughout evolution. However, oursociety is limited in that it cannot flout the ultimate universal rules of the second lawof thermodynamics or its corollary, the rule of the optimization of energy resourcesin chemical constructs. There is also a further twist: the individual observes itself and"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"484R. J. P. Williams and J. J. R. Fra ́usto da Silvaothers, and hence individuality evolved strongly. The arrival of self-consciousnessshould allow people to manage earth, but the downside can only be a reductionin individual use of energy and material. Already, too many people are acquiringgoods for a comfortable steady state at the highest level of individual demand.Despite the wondrous nature of the brain,Homo sapiensis a vulnerable animal,being dependent on hundreds, if not thousands, of species – even chemotypes –for all kinds of chemical supplies. In fact, humans are an internal ecosystem andthe product of a much larger external ecosystem. As mentioned earlier, biologicalevolution is not concerned with this or any other species; it is about survival ofthe fittestecosystemas described above. As the complexity increased with “infor-mation” from the environment in organisms, they decreased in self-sufficiency forgood reasons: Complexity is difficult to manage in one chemotype. However, it iscomplexity that human beings must manage in the future.Evolution and DNANow a major problem arises. If the DNA represents a well-adapted species in agiven environment, how does the DNA change when the environmental conditionsbecome hostile for the organisms so that the slowly acquired adaptive modificationsare transmitted to offspring – by random mutations of DNA and natural selection ofthe fittest, the official story – or by mutations influenced by external environmentalconditions? And to what extent are epigenetic changes [13, 14]affected or directedby the external environment? Is it really necessary to involve all of the DNA orthe structure of chromatin in a random way in response to change, or can there bechange in just selected parts to be transcribed [12, 16, 17]? Is selective mutationthe answer to the seemingly contradictory views of Darwin and Lamarck [20]? Canwe learn from the study of the way in which the immune system responds [21]?These are momentous problems, and currently many research efforts to elucidatethem are being made, which may also change our views on evolution. In this context,we have to offer some explanation of the origin of species (see below) that differsfrom the idea of a systematic development of the major features of evolution ofchemotypes.SpeciesIf we ask in the context of vertical evolution, “What is the origin of species?”the only answer we can give, seeing the large variety of organisms of equal sur-vival strength around us, is that they probably arise fromchance bifurcationmul-tiplied time and again. Systematic advance can then be based, not on species indi-vidually, only on relationships between species [1]. Species, we therefore agree,may arise through chance mutation throughout the DNA and Darwinian natural"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"21 Evolution revisited by inorganic chemists485selection. Also, distinct series of major mutations exist that are beneficial in thatthe organization within certain organisms gains some special advantage from novelinteraction with the environment. We then must view the species in themselves asbelonging to what de Duve [3] called “horizontal evolution.”Thus, the drive to gain from a change in the environment, inhibited by the con-servative nature of the required cytoplasmic chemistry and DNA, awaits imposedmutational change. The solution to this problem (which resembles a complex equa-tion with many variables) is a switch in kind, say from non-photosynthesizingto photosynthesizing – that is, eventually a switch in a large number of related,equally adapted species within several different groups, or chemotypes. The changein chemotypes is forced by the change in the environment, and to bring about thisdevelopment of the whole ecosystem the DNA must adapt its sequences. This isthe process of evolution, but it is deeply dependent on an ecosystem. We suggestthat there must be a more direct effect of the changing environment on the genesthan random variation of the whole genome. The most likely possibility is localizedgenetic variation dependent on novel chemicals forcing exposure of localized generegions that then mutate most rapidly.SummaryIf we are correct, the inevitability of evolution exists on the large scale; this is amatter of organization of chemicals in a physico-chemical succession. The processis in accord with the second law of thermodynamics in that it leads to an overallincrease of thermal entropy production. The energy degradation that causes thisincrease of entropy will of necessity increase in rate until no more energy can beabsorbed. Thus, the rate of entropy production can be said to strain to reach anoptimum. This driving force is of necessity linked to the increase of absorption ofuseful energy in synthesized or concentrated chemicals. The system incorporatesmore and more materials to optimize energy absorbed, retained, and eventuallyconverted to heat (see Table21.8) until there can be no further change. We observethat it is guided as a flow system within boundaries. The final condition, as stated,is the fully cyclic steady state when evolution ceases of necessity.The increasing involvement of energy and chemicals can only arise if the initialenergized chemical process created waste, for it is waste (e.g. oxygen) that in turncreates new opportunities for energy absorption until they too are incorporated inthe cycle. The environment changes – mainly inorganic – are faster than changesin organisms and lead the way. Organisms die, hide in niches, or must adapt. Wecannot examine only genomes to understand evolution, but must look at the presenceof organic and inorganic elements, e.g. in the metabolome and the metallome, asdescriptive of evolution."},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"486R.

Fra ́usto da SilvaTable 21.8.Involvement of elements in homeostasis during evolution"},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"21 Evolution revisited by inorganic chemists487Clearly, we must consider inorganic as well as organic biological chemistry tounderstand evolution of organisms together with environmental change. Startingfrom the beginning – the process of initial absorption of energy – any (inorganic)system, conditioned by pre-existing gradients, or fields, becomes formed, organizedin a confined space (see our early examples). Efficiency of energy capture requiresthat different formed systems cooperate. Any small, confined system open to fluxesof energy and material, such as a protocell, can, in principle, come to reproduceitself, but this requires a blueprint that takes the form of a code. The code is amemory of a previous existence, predating the DNA code, which can be connectedto an energized source to maintain and reproduce internal gradients in flows ofchemicals. These flows can feed back to the energized activity associated with thecode, and they interact with the external gradients in the environment. The systemthen becomes informed as an ecosystem and can sustain itself. Such a reproductiveorganism/environment system greatly strengthens its ability to capture energy (anddegrade it), and it will of necessity (see above) evolve using any changes in theenvironment, including those self-generated by waste (e.g. O2). In some manner orother, the DNA must follow any major environment change in chemotypes so as tokeep reproducibility.At the same time, a huge variety of species, genotypes, arise without rationalexplanation, and similar ones compete. Just as we may say “there will be wars andrumors of wars, but the end is not yet,” there may be no end to evolution of species, assuch evolution lies in full cooperation between the environment and the chemotypes(no matter what the species) in an optimal flowing, interactive ecosystem, aiming atan ideal cyclic steady state. However, such a state may be unattainable. Humankindmust become aware of the nature of such energized systems that dictate the waylife evolved and can evolve on earth. It is the whole ecosystem that evolves – thatis, environment and organisms. It requires deep thought by humankind to preservethe system of which humans have become the last source of innovation and theguardians of it all in a very short period of five hundred years. It is just as possibleto go backward or forward as to maintain a cycle.Wecan now answer the two parts of the question posed by the initiators of thisbook. (1) Was life destined to happen in this universe? (2) Was life destined to leadinexorably to greater and greater complexity?Probably, life was destined to happen because it is an effective (and efficient) wayto degrade available energy. Once it started, we believe evolution was also inevitable,as an ecosystem would of necessity develop with greater and increasing complexity;butthis development is of the ecosystem of organismsplusthe environment, notjust a development of organisms. The ecosystem evolved in the way it did becauseof the required chemistry of effective energy capture. Many forms of life evolved,butonly the multifarious mixture of them is optimal.

Fra ́usto da Silvalife, no logic is apparent in the minor species variations that have appeared; theyprobably arrived by chance.But one species is now different, for its development is due to rational thought,not gene changes, to the degree that it is a separate chemotype. Human activityrepresents a logical end-point of exploitation of the material elements, of energy,and of life, while remaining dependent on a multitude of other species. However,humankind must be careful. The human species is interventionist in that, throughunderstanding, it can to a large extent dictate ecological evolution with little leftto chance, at least in principle. However, restraint in uses of resources must beaccepted to sustain a favorable environment for survival of the present ecosystem.Note and acknowledgmentThis article is expanded in a full book by us on our general chemical approach tothe evolution of ecosystems [22].
