Teletypes clattered behind Plexiglas partitions. Copy boys darted fr om desk to desk. Reporters hunched over their typewriters in intense concentra tion. Editors barked into telephones. On the wall, a huge clock counted down the minutes. A copy boy hustled into the cavernous room and tossed three copies of the Chicago Daily News, hot off the presses, onto the middle of the city desk. Assistant city editors lunged at them and hungrily scanned the front page to see if the competition had beaten them on anything. One of them let out a grunt. In one motion, he ripped out an article and then pivoted, waving it in the face of a reporter who had made th e mistake of hovering too closely. \"Recover this!\" he demanded. Without looking at it, the reporter grabbed the scrap and headed for his desk to quickly make some phone calls so he could produce a similar story. Reporters at City Hall, the Criminal Courts Building, the State of Illinois Building, and Police Headquarters were phoning assistan t city editors to \"dope\" their stories. Once the reporters had provided a quick capsule of the situation, the assistants would cover their phone with a hand and ask their boss, the city editor, for a de cision on how the article should be handled. \"The cops were chasing a car and it hit a bus,\" on e of them called over to the city editor. \"Five injured, none seriously.\" \"School bus?\" \"City bus.\" The city editor frowned. \"Gimme a four-head,\" came the ordercode for a three-paragraph story. \"Four head,\" the assistant repeated into the phone. He pushed a button to connect the reporter to a rewrite man, who would take do wn details on a typewriter and then craft the item in a matter of minutes. The year was 1974. I was a rookie, just three months out of the University of Missouri's"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"school of journalism. I had worked on smaller news papers since I was four teen, but this was the big leagues. I was already addicted to the adrenaline. On that particular day, though, I felt more like a sp ectator than a participan t. I strolled over to the city desk and unceremoniously dropped my st ory into the \"in\" basket. It was a meager offering-a one-paragraph \"brief' about two pipe bombs exploding in the south suburbs. The item was destined for section three, pa ge ten, in a journalist ic trash heap called \"metropolitan briefs.\" However, my fortunes were about to change. Standing outside his glass-walled office, the assistant managing editor caught my attention. \"C'mere,\" he called. I walked over. \"What's up?\" \"Look at this,\" he said as he handed me a piece of wire copy. He didn't wait for me to read it before he started filling me in. \"Crazy stuff in West Virginia,\" he said. \"Peo ple getting shot at, sc hools getting bombed-all because some hillbillies are mad about th e textbooks being used in the schools.\" \"You're kidding,\" I said. \"Good story.\" My eyes scanned the brief Associated Press report. I quickly noticed that pastors were denouncing textbooks as being \"anti- God\" and that rallies were being held in churches. My stereotypes clicked in. \"Christians, huh?\" I said. \"So much for lovi ng their neighbors. And not being judgmental.\" He motioned for me to follow him over to a safe along the wall. He twirled the dial and opened it, reaching in to grab tw o packets of twenty-dollar bills. \"Get out to West Virginia and check it out,\" he said as he handed me the six hundred dollars of expense money. \"Give me a story for the bulldog.\" He was referring to the first edition of next Sunday's paper. That didn't give me much time. It was already noon on Monday. I started to walk away, but the editor grabbed my arm. \"L ook-be careful,\" he said. I was oblivious. \"What do you mean?\" He gestured toward the AP stor y I was clutching. \"These hillbil lies hate reporters,\" he said. \"They've already beaten up two of th em. Things are volatile. Be smart.\" I couldn't tell if the emotional surge I felt was fear or exhilaration. In the end, it didn't really matter. I knew I had to do whatever it would take to get the story. But the irony wasn't lost on me: these people were followers of the guy who sa id, \"Blessed are the peacemakers,\" and yet I was being warned to keep on guard to avoid getting roughed up. \"Christians .....I muttered under my breath. Hadn't they h eard, as one skeptic famously put it, that modern science had already dissolved Christianity in a vat of nitric acid?' IS DARWIN RESPONSIBLE? From the gleaming office buildings in downtow n Charleston to the dreary backwood hamlets in surrounding Kanawha County, the situation was tense when I arrived the next day and began poking around for a story. Many parents were keepi ng their kids out of sc hool; coal miners had walked off the job in wildcat strikes, threat ening to cripple the local economy; empty school buses were being shot at; firebom bs had been lobbed at some vacant classrooms; picketers were marching with signs saying, \"Even Hillbillies Have Constitutional Rights.\" Violence had left two people seriously injured. Intimida tion and threats were rampant. The wire services could handle the day-to-day breaking developments in the crisis; I planned to write an overview article that explained the dynamics of the contr oversy. Working from my hotel room, I called for appointment s with key figures in the conflict and then drove in my rental"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"car from homes to restaurants to schools to offi ces in order to intervie w them. I quickly found that just mentioning the word \"textbook\" to anybody in these parts would instantly release a flood of vehement opinion as thick as the lush trees that carpet the Appalachian hillsides. \"The books bought for our school ch ildren would teach them to lo se their love of God, to honor draft dodgers and revolutionaries , and to lose their respect for their pare nts,\" insisted the intense, darkhaired wife of a Baptist minister as I interviewe d her on the front porch of her house. As a recently elected school board memb er, she was leading the charge against the textbooks. A community activist was just as opinionated in the other direction. \"For the first time,\" she told me, \"these textbooks reflect real Americanis m, and I think it's exciti ng. Americanism, to me, is listening to all kinds of voices, not just white, Anglo-Saxon Protestants.\" The school superintendent, who had resigned at the height of the controversy, only shook his head in disdain when I asked him what he th ought. \"People around here are going flaky,\" he sighed. \"Both poles are wrong.\" Meanwhile, ninety-six thousand copies of three hundred different textbooks had been temporarily removed from classrooms and stored in cardboard cartons at a warehouse west of Charleston. They included Scott Foresman Co.'s Galaxy series; McDougal, Littel Co.'s Man series; Allyn & Bacon Inc.'s Breakthrough series; and such classics as The Lord of the Flies, Of Human Bondage, Moby Dick, The Ol d Man and the Sea, Animal Farm, and Plato's Republic. What were people so angry about ? Many said they were outraged at the \"situa tional ethics\" propounded in some of the books. One textbook in cluded the story of a child cheating a merchant out of a penny. Students were asked, \"Most people think that cheating is wrong. Do you think there is ever a time when it might be right? Tell when it is. Te ll why you think it is right.\" Parents seized on this as undermining the Christian values they were attempting to inculcate into their children. \"We're trying to get our kids to do the right thin g,\" the parent of an elementary student told me in obvious frustration. \"Then these books co me along and say that sometimes the wrong thing is the right thing. We just don't belie ve in that! The Ten Commandments are the Ten Commandments.\" But there was also an undercurre nt of something else: an inc hoate fear of the future, of change, of new ideas, of cultural transformation. I could sense a simmering frustration in people over how modernity was eroding th e foundation of their faith. \"Ma ny of the protesters,\" wrote the Charleston Gazette, \"are demonstrating against a changing world.\" This underlying concern was crystallized for me in a conversation with a local businessman over hamburgers at a Charleston diner. When I asked him why he was so enraged over the textbooks, he reached into his pocket and took out a newspaper clipping about the textbook imbroglio. \"Listen to what Dynamics of Language tells our kids,\" he said as he quoted an excerpt from the textbook: \"Read the theory of divine origin and the story of the Tower of Babel as told in Genesis. Be prepared to expl ain one or more ways these st ories could be interpreted.\" He tossed the well-worn clipping on the table in disgust. \"The theory of divine origin!\" he declared. \"The Word of God is not a theory. Take God out of creation and what's left? Evolution? Scientists want to teach our kids that divine origin is just a theory that stupid people believe but that evolution is a sc ientific fact. Well, it's not. And that's at the bottom of this.\" I cocked my head. \"Are you saying Charles Da rwin is responsible for all of this?\" \"Let me put it this way,\" he said. \"If Darwin's right, we're just sophisticated monkeys. The"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Bible is wrong. There is no God. And without God, there's no right or wrong. We can just make up our morals as we go. The basis for all we believe is destroyed. And that's why this country is headed to hell in a handbasket . Is Darwin responsible? I'll sa y this: people ha ve to choose between science and faith, between evolution a nd the Bible, between the Ten Commandments and make'em-up-as-you-go ethics. We've made our choice-and we're not budging.\" He took a swig of beer. \"Have you seen the te acher's manual?\" he asked. I shook my head. \"It says students should compare the Bible story of Da niel in the Lion's Den to that myth about a lion. You know which one I'm talking about?\" \"Androcles and the Lion?\" I asked, referring to the Aesop fable about an escaped slave who removed a thorn from the paw of a lion he encoun tered in the woods. Late r, the recaptured slave was to be eaten by a lion for the entertainment of the crowd at the Roman Coliseum, but it turned out to be the same lion he had befriended. Instead of eating him, the lion ge ntly licked his hand, which impressed the emperor so much that the slave was set free. \"Yeah, that's the one,\" the businessman said as he wagged a french fr y at me. \"What does it tell our kids when they're supposed to compare that to the Bible? That the Bible is just a bunch of fairy tales? That it's all a myth? That you can interpret the Bible any way you darn well please, even if it rips the guts out of what it really sa ys? We've got to put our foot down. I'm not going to let a bunch of eggheads destroy the faith of my children.\" I felt like I was finally gett ing down to the root of the controversy. I scribbled down his words as well as I could. Part of me, though, wanted to debate him. Didn't he know that evolution is a proven fact? Di dn't he realize that in an age of science and technology that it's simply irra tional to believe the ancient myths about G od creating the world and shaping human beings in his own image? Di d he really want his children clinging desperately to religious pap that is so cl early disproved by mode rn cosmology, astronomy, zoology, comparative anatomy, geology, paleonto logy, biology, genetics, and anthropology? I was tempted to say, \"Hey, what is the difference between Daniel in the Lion's Den and Androcles and the Lion? They're both fairy tales!\" But I wasn't there to get into an argument. I was there to report the story-a nd what a bizarre story it was! In the last part of the twentieth century, in an era when we had split the atom and put people on the moon and found fossils that prove evolu tion beyond all doubt, a bunch of religious zealots were tying a county into knots because they couldn't let go of religious folklore. It simply defied all reason. I thought for a moment. \"One more question, \" I said. \"Do you ever have any doubts?\" He waved his hand as if to draw my attenti on to the universe. \"Look at the world,\" he said. \"God's fingerprints are all over it. I'm absolutely sure of that. How else do you explain nature and human beings? And God has told us how to live. If we ignore him-well, then the whole world's in for a whole lot of trouble.\" I reached for the check. \"Thanks for your opinions,\" I told him. STANDING TRIAL IN WEST VIRGINIA All of this was good stuff for my story, but I n eeded more. The leaders I had interviewed had all denounced the violence as being the unfortunate actions of a few hotheads. But to tell the whole story, I needed to see the underbelly of the controversy. I wa nted to tap into the rage of those who chose violence over deba te. My opportunity quickly came. A rally, I heard, was being planned for Friday night over in the isolated, heavily wooded community of Campbell's Creek. Angry parents were expected to gather and vote on whether to"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"continue to keep their kids out of school. Temper s were at a boiling point, and the word was that reporters were not welcome. It seemed that folks were incensed over the way some big newspapers had caricatured them as know-nothing h illbillies, so this was intended to be a private gathering of the faithful, where th ey could freely speak their minds. This was my chance. I decided to infiltrate th e rally to get an unvarnished look at what was really going on. At the time, it seemed like a good idea. I rendezvoused with Charlie, a top-notch photojournalist dispatched by the Tribune to capture the textbook war on film. We decided that we would sneak into the rural school where hundreds of agitated protesters were expected to pack th e bleachers. I'd scribble my notes surreptitiously; Charlie would see whether he could snap a few discreet photos. We figur ed if we could just blend into the crowd, we'd get away with it. We figured wrong. Our shiny new rental car stood in sharp contrast with the dust y pick-up trucks and well-used cars that were hastily left at all angles on the gravel parking lot. We tried to be as inconspicuous as possible as we walked noncha lantly beside the st ragglers who were streaming toward the gymnasium. Charlie kept his Nikons hidden beneath his waist-length denim jacket, but there was no way he could conceal his long black hair. At first, I thought we'd gotten aw ay with it. We flowed with the crowd through a side door of the gym. Inside, the noise was deafening. Two la rge bleachers were packed with animated and agitated people who all seemed to be talking at once. Someone was setti ng up a small speaker on the floor of the gym. Charlie and I were m illing around with people who were standing by the door, unable to find a seat. Nobody seemed to be paying any attention to us. A beefy man in a white short- sleeve shirt and dark, narrow tie took the handheld microphone and blew into it to see if it was working. \"Let me have your attention,\" he shouted over the din. \"Let's get started.\" People began to settle down. But as they did, I got the uncomfortable fe eling that a lot of eyes were starting to bore in on us. \"Wait a mi nute,\" the guy at the microphone said. \"We've got some intruders here!\" With th at, he turned and glared at Charlie and me. People around us pivoted to confront the two of us. The room fell silent. \"C'mon out here!\" the man demanded, gesturing for both of us to come onto the gym floor. \"Who are you? You're not welcome here!\" With that, the crowd erupted into catcalls and jeers. Unsu re what to do, Charlie and I stepped hesitantly toward the man with the micr ophone. It seemed like all of the anger in the room was suddenly focused on the two of us. My first thought was that I didn't like becomi ng part of the story. My second thought was that this mob was going to throw us out of th e place-and we were going to get roughed up along the way. My third thought was that nothing in journalism school had prepared me for this. \"What should we do with these two boys?\" the man asked, baiting the crowd. Now the folks were really riled! I felt like I was being put on trial. When I used to hear the phrase my knees were shaking, I thought it was just a figure of speech. But my knees were shaking! \"Let's get rid of them!\" he declared. The door was blocked. There was nowhere to run. But just as some men were surging forward to grab us, a part-time truck driver, part-time preacher stepped up and wrested away the microphone. He raised his hand to stop them. \"Hold on!\" he shouted. \"Just a minute! Settle down!\" Obviou sly, he was someone the crowd respected. The noise subsided. \"Now listen to me,\" he continued. \"I've seen this reporter around"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"town the last few days, interviewing both sides of this thing. I think he wants to tell the story like it is. I think he wants to be fair. I say we give him a chance. I say we let him stay!\" The crowd was uncertain. There was some grumbling. The preacher turned toward me. \"You're gonna be fair, aren't you?\" he asked. I nodded as reassuringly as I could. The preacher turned to the crowd. \"How else ar e we going to get our story out?\" he asked. \"Let's welcome these fellas and trus t they're gonna do the right thing!\" That seemed to convince them. The mood quic kly shifted. In fact, some people started applauding. Instead of throwing us out, someone us hered us to seats in the front row of the bleachers. Charlie took out his cameras and be gan snapping pictures. I took out my notebook and pen. \"WE'LL WIN-ONE WAY OR THE OTHER\" The preacher took control of the meeting. He tu rned to the crowd and held aloft a book titled Facts about VD. \"This is gonna turn your stomachs, but this is the kind of book your children are reading!\" he shouted in his Mayberry accent. There were gasps. \"Get those books out of the schools!\" someone shouted. \"Get 'em out!\" several others echoed as if they were saying \"amen\" at a revival meeting. The preacher began to pace back and forth, pers piration rings expanding on his white shirt, as he waved the book. \"Y'all have got to force yourselves to look at these books so you can really understand what the issue is all about!\" he decl ared. \"Your children may be reading these books. This is not the way to teach our kids about sexdivorced from morality, divorced from God. And that's why we've got to continue keeping our kids out of school for another week to boycott these filthy, un-American, anti-religious books.\" That catapulted the crowd into a clapping fr enzy. Money poured into the Kentucky Fried Chicken buckets being passed around for donations to fight the battle. The rally continued in that vein for another ha lf an hour or so. At one point, the preacher's words were reminiscent of the businessman's comments earlier in the week. \"We're not evolved from slime,\" he declared defiantly. \"We're creat ed in the image of God Almighty. And he's given us the best textbook in the world to tell us how to live!\" The folks roared their approval. \"The only victory we'll accept is a total victor y,\" he declared. \"We'll win-one way or the other.\" When he raised the issue of whether the school boycott should be continued through the coming week, the resounding response was yes. Th e goal of the rally acco mplished, he issued a quick \"God bless y'all,\" and the meeting was over. Now I had all the color I needed for my story. I hustled back to my hotel and banged out a piece for Sunday's paper, which appeared on the front page under the headline, \"Textbook Battle Rages in Bible Belt County.\" I followed that with an in-depth article that also ran on the front page the next day. 2 Settling back into my seat as I flew back to Chicago, I reflected on the experience and concluded that I had fulfilled my promise to th e preacher: I had been fair to both sides. My articles were balanced and responsible . But, frankly, it had been difficult. Inside that gymnasium Friday night, I felt lik e I had stared unadorned Christianity in the face-and saw it for the dinosaur it was. Why couldn't these people get th eir heads out of the sand and admit the obvious: science had put their God out of a job!

If Darwinism is true, he said, then there are five inescapable conclusions: there's no evidence for God there's no life after death there's no absolute foundation for right and wrong there's no ultimate meaning for life people don't really have free wi1l To me, the controversy in West Virginia was a symbolic last gasp of an archaic belief system hurtling toward obliv ion.

As far as I was concerned, that day couldn't come soon enough."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 2 THE IMAGES OF EVOLUTION The problem is to get [people] to reject irrational and supernatural explanations of the world, the demons that exist only in th eir imaginations, and to accept a social and intellectual apparatus, Science, as the only begetter of truth. Harvard geneticist Richard Lewontin Science ... has become identified with a philo sophy known as materialism or scientific naturalism. This philosophy insists that nature is all there is, or at least the only thing about which we can have any knowledge. It foll ows that nature had to do its own creating, and that the means of creation must not have included any role for God. Evolution critic Phillip E. Johnson Rewind history to 1966. The big hit on the radio was Paul McCartney crooning \"Michelle.\" On a television show called I Spy, Bill Cosby was becoming the first African-American to share the lead in a dramatic series. Bread was nineteen cents a loaf; a new Fo rd Fairlane cost $1,600. As a fourteen-year-old freshman at Prospect High School in northwest suburban Chicago, I was sitting in a third-floor sc ience classroom overlooking the asphalt parking lot, second row from the window, third seat from the front, when I first heard the liberating information that propelled me toward a life of atheism. I already liked this introductory biology class. It fit we ll with my logical way of looking at the world, an approach that was already tugging me toward the evidence-oriented fields of journalism and law. I was incurably curious, always after answers, constan tly trying to figure out how things worked. As a youngster, my parents once gave me an electric train for Christmas. A short time later my dad discovered me in the garage, repeatedly hurling the locomotive against the concrete floor in a futile attempt to crack it open. I didn't understand why he was so upset. All I was doing, I meekly explained, was trying to figure out what made it work. That's why I liked science. Here the teacher actually encouraged me to cut open a frog to find out how it functioned. Science gave me an excuse to ask all the \"why\" questions that plagued me, to try genetic experime nts by breeding fruit flies, and to peer inside plants to learn about how they reproduced. To me, science repres ented the empirical, the trustworthy, the hard facts, the experimentally prove n. I tended to dismiss everything else as being mere opinion,"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"conjecture, superstiti on-and mindless faith. I would have resonated with what philosopher J. P. Moreland wrote years later, when he said that for many people the term scientific meant something was \"good, rational, and modern,\" whereas something not scientific was old-fashio ned and not worth the belief of thinking people. 3 My trust in science had been shaped by grow ing up in postSputnik America, where science and technology had been exalted as holding the keys to the survival of our country. The Eisenhower administration had e xhorted young people to pursue ca reers in science so America could catch up with-and surpass-our enemy, the Soviets, who had stunned the world in 1957 by launching the world's first artif icial satellite into an elliptical orbit around Earth. Later, as our nation began unraveling in the 1960s, when social conventions were being turned upside down, when relativism and situational ethics were st arting to create a quicksand of morality, when one tradition after another was being upended, I saw science as remaining steady-a foundation, an anchor, always rock-solid in its methodology while at the same time constantly moving forward in a reflect ion of the American can-do spirit. Put a man on the moon? Nobody doubted we w ould do it. New technology, from transistors to Teflon, kept making life in America better and better. Could a cure for cancer be far off? It was no accident that my admiration for scie ntific thinking was developing at the same time that my confidence in God was waning. In Sunday school and confirmation classes during my junior high school years, my \"why\" questions weren't always welcomed. While many of the other students seemed to automatically accept th e truth of the Bible, I needed reasons for trusting it. But more often than not, my quest fo r answers was rebuffed. Instead, I was required to read, memorize, and regurgitate Bible verses and the writings of Martin Luther and other seemingly irrelevant theologians from the distant past. Who cared what these long-dead zealots believed? I had no use for the \"soft\" issues of faith and spirituality; rather, I was gravitating toward th e \"hard\" facts of science. As Eugenie Scott of the National Center for Science Education observe d, \"You can't put an omnipotent deity in a test tube.\"A If there wasn't any scientific or rationa l evidence for believing in such an entity, then I wasn't interested. That's when, on that pivotal day in biology cl ass in 1966, I began to le arn about scientific discoveries that, to borrow the words of British zoologist Richard Dawkins, \"made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist.\" 5 THE IMAGES OF EVOLUTION I tend to be a visual thinker. Images stick in my mind for long periods of time. When I think back to those days as a high school student, wh at I learned in the classroom and through my eager consumption of outside books can be summed up in a series of pictures. Image #1: The Tubes, Flasks, and Electrodes of the Stanley Miller Experiment This was the most powerful picture of all-the laboratory apparatus that Stanley Miller, then a graduate student at the University of Chicago, used in 1953 to artific ially produce the building blocks of life. By reproducing the atmosphere of the primitive earth and then shooting electric sparks through it to simulate lightning, Miller managed to produce a red goo containing amino acids. The moment I first learned of Miller's success, my mind flashed to the logical implication: if the origin of life can be explaine d solely through natural processe s, then God was out of a job! After all, there was no need for a deity if living organisms could emerge by themselves out of the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"primordial soup and then develop naturally over the eons into more and more complex creatures- a scenario that was illustrated by the next image of evolution. Image #2: Darwin's \"Tree of Life\" The first time I read Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species, I was struck that there was only one illustration: a sketch in whic h he depicted the development of life as a tree, st arting with an ancient ancestor at the bottom and then blosso ming upward into limbs, branches, and twigs as life evolved with increasing diversity and complexity. As a recent textbook explained, Darwinism teaches th at all life forms ar e \"related through descent from some unknown prototype that lived in the remote past.\" 6 It seemed obvious to me that there's such a phenomenon as microevolution, or variation within different kinds of animals. I could see this illustrated in my own neighborhood, where we had dozens of different varietie s of dogs. But I was captivated by the more ambitious claim of macroevolution-that natural selection acting on random variation can explain how primitive cells morphed over long periods of time into every sp ecies of creatures, including human beings. In other words, fish were transformed into amphibi ans, amphibians into rept iles, and reptiles into birds and mammals, with humans having the same ancestor as apes. So while Miller seemed to estab lish that life could have arisen spontaneously in the chemical oceans of long-ago Earth, Darwin's theory account ed for how so many millions of species of organisms could slowly and gra dually develop over huge expanses of time. Then came further confirmation of our common ancestry, illustrated by the next image. Image #3: Ernst Haeckel's Drawings of Embryos German biologist Ernst Haeckel, whose sketches of embryos could be found in virtually every evolution book I studied, pr ovided even more evidence for all of life having the same ancient progenitor. By juxtaposi ng drawings of an embryonic fis h, salamander, tortoise, chick, hog, calf, rabbit, and human, Haeckel graphically es tablished that they all appeared strikingly similar in their earliest stages of development. It was only later that they became distinctly different. As my eyes scanned the top row of Haeckel's drawings, representin g the early stage of embryonic development, I was stunned by how these vertebrates-which would eventually grow to become so radically different from each other-were virtually indistinguishable. Who could tell them apart? The human embryo coul d just as easily have been any one of the others. Obviously, Darwin was right when he said \"we ought to frankly admit\" universal common ancestry. And certainly the inexorable pr ogression toward ever-increasing complexity could be seen in the next image. Image #4: The Missing Link The fossil is so astounding that one paleontologist called it \"a hol y relic of the past that has become a powerful symbol of the evolutionary pro cess itself.\"' It's the most famous fossil in the world: the a rchaeopteryx, or \"ancient wing,\" a creature dati ng back 150 million years. With the wings, feathers, and wishbone of a bird, but with a lizard-like tail and claws on its wings, it was hailed as the missing link between reptiles and modern birds. One look at a picture of that fossil chased away any misgivings about whether the fossil record supported Darwin's theory. Here was a ha lf-bird, half-reptile-I needed to look no further to believe that paleontology backed up Darwin. Indeed, the archaeopteryx, having been discovered in Germany immediately after The Origin of Species was published, \"helped"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"enormously to establish the credibility of Darw inism and to discredit sk eptics,\" Johnson said. 8 These images were just the beginning of my education in evolution. By the time I had completed my study of the topic, I was thoroughl y convinced that Darwin had explained away any need for God. And that's a phenomenon I have seen over and over again. I've lost count of the number of spiritual skep tics who have told me th at their seeds of doubt were planted in high school or co llege when they studied Darwin ism. When I read in 2002 about an Eagle Scout being booted from his troop for re fusing to pledge reve rence to God, I wasn't surprise to find out he \"has been an atheis t since studying evolution in the ninth grade.\" 9 As Oxford evolutionist Dawkins said: \"T he more you understand the significance of evolution, the more you are pushed away from an agnostic position and towards atheism.\" 10 DARWIN VERSUS GOD Not everyone, however, believes that Darwinian evolutionary theory and God are incompatible. There are some scientists and theo logians who see no conflict between believing in the doctrines of Darwin and th e doctrines of Christianity. Nobel-winning biologist Christian de Duve insi sted there's \"no sense in which atheism is enforced or established by science,\" 11 while biology professor Kenneth R. Miller of Brown University declared that evolution \"is not anti-God.\" Philosopher Michael Ruse, himself an ardent naturalist, answ ered the question, \"Can a Darwinian be a Christ ian?\" by declaring, \"Absolutely!\" In his view, \"No sound argument has been mounted showing that Darwinism implies atheism.\" 13 Biologist Jean Pond, who formerly taught at Whitw orth College, proudly describes herself as \"a scientist, an evolutionist, a great ad mirer of Charles Darwin, and a Christian.” 14 She elaborated by saying: \"Believing that evolut ion occurred-that humans and all other living things are related as part of creation's giant family tree, that it is possible that the first cell arose by the natural processes of chemical evolution-neither requires nor even promotes an atheistic worldview.\" 15 Personally, however, I couldn't understand how the Darwinism I was taught left any meaningful role for God. I was told that the evolutionary process was by definition undirected- and to me, that automatically ruled out a supernat ural deity who was pulli ng the strings behind the scene. One recent textbook was very clear about th is: `By coupling undirected, purposeless variation to the blind, uncaring pr ocess of natural selection, Darwin made theological or spiritual explanations of life processes superfluous.\" 16 Other textbooks affirm th at evolution is \"random and undirected\" and \"without either plan or pur pose\" and that \"Darwin gave biology a sound scientific basis by attributing the diversity of li fe to natural causes rather than supernatural creation.\" If this is how scientists define Darwinism, then it seemed to me that God has been given his walking papers. To try to somehow salvage an obscure role for him appears pointless, which Cornell's William Provine readily concedes: \"A widespread theological view now exists saying that God started off the world, pr ops it up and works through laws of nature, very subtly, so subtly that its action is undetectable,\" he said. \"B ut that kind of God is ef fectively no different to my mind than atheism.\" 18 Certainly Christians would sa y that God is not a hidden a nd uninvolved deity who thoroughly conceals his activity, but rather that he has interv ened in the world so much that the Bible says his qualities \"have been clearly seen ... from what has been made.\" 19 Cambridgeeducated philosopher of science Stephen C. Meyer, director of the Center for Science and Culture at the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Discovery Institute in Seattle, put it this way: Many evolutionary biologists admit that science cannot categorically exclude the possibility that some kind of deity still might exist. Nor can they deny the possibility of a divine designer who so masks his creative activ ity in apparently natural processes as to escape scientific detection. Yet for most scientif ic materialists such an undetectable entity hardly seems worthy of consideration. 20 Even so, Meyer stressed that \"contemporary Darwinism does not envision a God-guided process of evolutionary change.\" 21 He cites a famous observati on by the late evolutionary biologist George Gaylord Simpson that Darwinism teaches \"man is the result of a purposeless and natural process that did not have him in mind.\" 22 The ramifications are unmistakable, according to Meyer: \"To say that God guides an i nherently unguided natural process, or that God designed a natural mechanism as a substitute for his design, is clearly contradictory.\" 23 Nancy Pearcey, who has written extensively on sc ience and faith, insists that \"you can have God or natural selection, but not both.\" 24 She pointed out that Darwin himself recognized that the presence of an omnipotent deity would actually undermine his theory. \"If we admit God into the process, Darwin argued, then God would ensure that only `the right variations occurred ... and natural selection would be superfluous. “25 Law professor Phillip Johnson, author of the breakthrough critique of evolution Darwin On Trial, agrees that \"the whole point of Darwinism is to show that there is no need for a supernatural creator, because na ture can do the creating by itself.\" 26 In fact, many of the evolutionists who have fe lt the sting of Johnson's criticism nevertheless find themselves in agreement with him on this particular matter. For example, evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr emphasized that \"the real core of Darwinism\" is natural selection, which \"permits the explanation of adaption ... by natu ral means, instead of by divine intervention.\" 27 Another leading evolutionist, Fr ancisco Ayala, who was ordained a Dominican priest prior to his science career and yet refused in a recent inte rview to confirm whether he still believes in God, 28 said Darwin's \"greatest accomplishment\" was to show that \"living beings can be explained as the result of a natural process, natural selecti on, without any need to resort to a Creator or other external agent.\" 29 When an attorney asked the outspoken Provine whether there is \"a n intellectually honest Christian evolutionist position ... or do we simply have to check our brains at the church house door,\" Provine's answer was straightforward: \"You indeed have to check your brains.\" 30 Apparently to him, the term \"Chr istian evolutionist\" is oxymoronic. Pulitzer Prize-winning sociobiologist Edward 0. Wilson was adamant on this issue. \"If humankind evolved by Darwinian natu ral selection,\" he said, \"genet ic chance and environmental necessity, not God, made the species.\" 31 No ambiguity there. Characteristically, Time magazine summed up the matter succinctly: \"Charles Darwin didn't want to murder God, as he once put it. But he did.\" 32 DARWIN'S UNIVERSAL ACID I wasn't aware of these kind of observations when I was a student. I just knew intuitively that the theories of Darwin gave me an intellectual basis to reject the mythology of Christianity that my parents had tried to foist on me through my younger years. At one point, I remember reading the World Book Encyclopedia that my parents had given me as a birthday present to answer the \"why\" questions with which I was always tormenting"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"them. Reading selectively from the entry on e volution served to reinforce my sense that Christianity and Darwinism are incompatible. \"In the Bible, God is held to be the Creator, the Sustainer, and the Ultimate End of all things,\" the encyclopedia said. \"M any Christians believe that it is impossible to reconcile this conviction with the idea that evolutionary development has been brought about by natural forces present in organic life.\" 33 Everything fell into place for me. My assessmen t was that you didn't need a Creator if life can emerge unassisted from the primordial slim e of the primitive earth, and you don't need God to create human beings in his image if we ar e merely the product of the impersonal forces of natural selection. In short, you don' t need the Bible if you've got The Origin of Species. I was experiencing on a personal level what philosopher Daniel Dennett has observed: Darwinism is a \"universal acid\" that \"eats throug h just about every traditional concept and leaves in its wake a revolutionized worldview.\" 34 My worldview was being revolutionized, all ri ght, yet in my youthful optimism I wasn't ready to examine some of the disheartening im plications of my new philosophy. I conveniently ignored the grim picture pain ted by British atheist Bertrand Russell, who wrote about how science had presented us with a world that was \"purposeless\" and \"void of meaning.” He said: That man is the product of causes which had no prevision of the end they were achieving; that his origin, his growth, his hopes and fear s, his loves and beliefs are but the outcome of accidental collocations of atoms; that no fire, no heroism, no intensity of thought and feeling, can preserve an indivi dual life beyond the grave; that all the labors of the ages, all the devotion, all the inspira tion, all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction ... that th e whole temple of man's achieveme nt must inevitably be buried-all these things, if not quite beyond dispute, ar e yet so nearly certain, that no philosophy which rejects them can hope to stand. Only with in the scaffolding of these truths, only on the firm foundation of unyielding despair, can the soul's habitation he nceforth be safely built. 36 Rather than facing this \"unyielding despair\" th at's implicit in a world without God, I reveled in my newly achieved freedom from God's mora l strictures. For me, liv ing without God meant living one hundred percent for myself. Freed fr om someday being held accountable for my actions, I felt unleashed to pursue persona l happiness and pleas ure at all costs. The sexual revolution of the '60s and '70s was st arting to dawn, and I was liberated to indulge as much as I wanted, without having to look ove r my shoulder at God's disapproving gaze. As a journalist, I was unshackled to compete without always having to abide by those pesky rules of ethics and morality. I would let nothing, an d certainly nobody, stand between me and my ambitions. Who cared if scientific materialism taught that there is nothing other than matter and therefore no person could possibly survive th e grave? I was too young to trifle with the implications of that; instead, I pursued the kind of immortality I could attain by leaving my mark as a successful journalist, whose investigations a nd articles would spur ne w legislation and social reform. As for the finality of death-well, I had plenty of time to ponder th at later. There was too much living to do in the meantime. So the seeds of my atheism were sown as a youngster when religious authorities seemed unwilling or unable to help me get answers to my questions about God. My disbelief flowered after discovering that Darwinism displaces the n eed for a deity. And my atheism came to full"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"bloom when I studied Jesus in college and was told that no scie nce-minded person could possibly believe what the New Testament says about him. According to members of the left-wing Jesus Se minar, the same impulse that had given rise to experimental science, \"which sought to put all know ledge to the test of close and repeated observation,\" also prompted their efforts to finally distinguish \"the factual from the fictional\" in Jesus' life. They concluded that in \"this scien tific age,\" modern thinke rs can no longer believe that Jesus did or said much of what the Bible claims. As they put it: The Christ of creed and dogma, who had been firmly in place in the Middle Ages, can no longer command the assent of those who have seen the heavens through Galileo's telescope. The old deities and demons were swep t from the skies by that remarkable glass. Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo have dismantle d the mythological abodes of the gods and Satan, and bequeathed us secular heavens. 31 By the time I was halfway through college, my atheistic attitudes were so entrenched that I was becoming more and more impatient toward pe ople of mindless faith, lik e those protesters I would later encounter in West Virginia. I couldn 't fathom their stubborn reluctance to subject their outmoded beliefs to that \"universal acid\" of modern scientific thought. I felt smugly arrogant toward them. Let them re main slaves to their wishful thinking about a heavenly home and to the straightjacket morality of their imaginary God. As for me, I would dispassionately follow the conclusions of the scientists and historia ns whose logical and consistent research has reduced th e world to material processes only. THE INVESTIGATION BEGINS If I had stopped asking questions, that's wh ere I would have remained. But with my background in journalism and law, the demanding of answers was woven into my nature. So five years after my adventure in West Virginia, when my wife Leslie announced that she had decided to become a follower of Jesus, it was understandable that the first words I uttered would be in the form of an inquiry. It wasn't asked politely. Instead, it was spewed in a venomous and accusatory tone: \"What has gotten into you?\" I simply couldn't comprehend how such a rational person could buy into an irrational religious concoction of wishful thinking, make-believe, mythology, and legend. In the ensuing months, however, as Leslie's character began to ch ange, as her values underwent a transformation, as she became a mo re loving and caring and authentic person, I began asking the same question, only this time in a softer and more sincere tone of genuine wonderment: \"What has gotten into you?\" Something-or, as she would claim, Someone-was undeniably changing her for the better. Clearly, I needed to investigate what was goi ng on. And so I began asking more questions-a lot of them-about faith, God, and the Bible. I was determined to go wherever the answers would take me-even though, frankly, I wasn't quite prepared back then for where I would ultimately end up. This multifaceted spiritual investigation lasted nearly two years. In my previous book, The Case for Christ, which retraced and expanded upon this journey, I discussed the answers I received from thirteen leading experts about the hist orical evidence for Jesus of Nazareth. 38 In my subsequent book, The Case for Faith, I pursued answers to the \"B ig Eight\" questions about Christianity-the kind of issues that began troubling me even as a youngster but that nobody had been willing to answer. 39"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"In those earlier hooks, however, I barely touc hed upon another important dimension to my investigation. Because science had played such an instrumental role in propelling me toward atheism, I also devoted a lot of time to posing ques tions about what the late st research says about God. With an open mind, I began asking: • Are science and faith doomed to always be at war? Was I right to think that a science- minded individual must necessarily eschew religious beliefs? Or is there a fundamentally different way to view the relationship be tween the spiritual and the scientific? • Does the latest scientific evidence tend to poi nt toward or away fr om the existence of God? • Are those images of evolution that spurred me to atheism still valid in light of the most recent discoveries in science? When I first began exploring these issues in the early 1980s, I found that there was a sufficient amount of evidence to guide me to a confident conclusion. Much has changed since then, however. Science is always pressing relentlessly forward, and a lot more data and many more discoveries have been poured into the reservoir of scientific knowledge during the past twenty years. All of which has prompted me to ask a new question: does this deeper and richer pool of contemporary scientific research contradict or affirm the conclusions I reached so many years ago? Put another way, in which direction-toward Darwin or God-is the cu rrent arrow of science now pointing? \"Science,\" said two-time Nobel Prize winner Li nus Pauling, \"is the search for the truth.\" 40 And that's what I decided to embark upon-a new journey of discovery that would both broaden and update the original inves tigation I conducted into science more than two decades ago. My approach would be to cross-examine authori ties in various scientific disciplines about the most current findings in their fields. In sele cting these experts, I sought doctorate-level professors who have unquestioned expertise, are able to communicate in accessible language, and who refuse to limit themselves only to th e politically correct world of naturalism or materialism. After all, it wouldn't make sense to rule out any hypothesis at the outset. I wanted the freedom to pursue all possibilities. I would stand in the shoes of the skeptic, reading all sides of each topic and posing the toughest objections that have been raised. More importantly, I woul d ask the experts the kind of questions that personally plagued me when I was an atheist. In fact, perhaps these are the very same issues that have proven to be sticking points in your own spiritual journey. Maybe you too have wondered whether belief in a supernatural God is consis tent with what science has uncovered about the natural world. If so, I hope you'll join me in my investigation. Strip away your preconceptions as much as possible and keep an open mind as you eavesdrop on my conversations with these fascinating scientists and science- trained philosophers. At the end you can decide for yourself whether their answers and explanations stand up to scrutiny. Let me caution you, though, that getting beyond our prejudices can be difficult. At least, it was for me. I once had a lot of motivation to stay on the atheistic path. I didn't want there to be a God who would hold me responsible for my immoral lifestyle. As the legal-affairs editor at the most powerful newspaper in the Midwest, I was used to pushing pe ople around, not humbly submitting myself to some invisible spiritual authority. I was trained not only to ask questions, however , but to go wherever the answers would take me. And I trust you have the same attitude.

Evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr Scientists who utterly reject evolution may be one of our fastestg rowing controversial minorities.... Many of the scien tists supporting this position ho ld impressive credentials in science. Larry Hatfield in Science Digest There were one hundred of them-biologists, chem ists, zoologists, physicists, anthropologists, molecular and cell biologists, bioengineers, organic chemists, geologists, astrophysicists, and other scientists. Their doctorates came from such prestigious univ ersities as Cambridge, Stanford, Cornell, Yale, Rutgers, Chicago, Princeton, Purdue, Duke, Michigan, Syracuse, Temple, and Berkeley. They included professors from Yale Grad uate School, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Tulane, Rice, Emory, George Mason, Lehigh, and the Universities of California, Washington, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Ohi o, Colorado, Nebraska, Missouri, Iowa, Georgia, New Mexico, Uta h, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere. Among them was the director of the Center for Computational Quantum Chemistry and scientists at the Plasma Physics Lab at Princeton, the National Museum of Natural History at the Smithsonian Institute, the Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories. And they wanted the world to know one thing: they are skeptical. After spokespersons for the Public Broadcasting System's seven-part television series Evolution asserted that \"all known scie ntific evidence supports [Darwinian] evolution\" as does \"virtually every reputable scientist in the worl d,\" these professors, laboratory researchers, and other scientists published a two-page advertisem ent in a national magazine under the banner: \"A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism.\""},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Their statement was direct and defiant. \"We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for th e complexity of life,\" they said. \"Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged.\" 3 These were not narrow-minded fundamentalists, backwoods West Virginia protesters, or rabid religious fanatics-just respected, worldclass scientists like Nobel nominee Henry F. Schaefer, the third mostcited chemist in the world; James Tour of Rice University's Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology; and Fred Fi gworth, professor of cellular and molecular physiology at Yale Graduate School. Together, despite the specter of professiona l persecution, they br oached the politically incorrect opinion that the empero r of evolution has no clothes. As a high school and university student studying evolution, I was never told that there were credible scientists who harbored significant skepticism toward Darwinian theory. I had been under the impression that it was only know-nothi ng pastors who objected to evolution on the grounds that it contradicted the Bible's claims. I wasn't aware that, according to historian Peter Bowler, substantive scientific cr itiques of natural se lection started so ea rly that by 1900 \"its opponents were convinced it would never recover.\" 4 Viewers of the popular 2001 PBS series weren't told that, either. In fact, its one-sided depiction of evolution spurred a backlash from many scientists. A detailed, 151-page critique claimed it \"failed to present accurately and fairly the scientific problems with the evidence for Darwinian evolution\" and even systematically ignored \"dis agreements among evolutionary biologists themselves.\" 5 In my quest to determine if contemporary scie nce points toward or aw ay from God, I knew I had to first examine the claims of evolution in order to conclude on ce and for all whether Darwinism creates a reasonable foundation for athe ism. That's because if the materialism of Darwinian evolution is a fact, then the atheistic conclusions I reach ed as a student might still be valid. Only after resolving this issue could I move ahead to assessing whether there is persuasive affirmative evidence for a Creator. So I decided to return, in eff ect, to my days as a student by reexamining those images of evolution-the Miller experiment, Darwin's tree of life, Haeckel's embryos, and the archaeopteryx missing link-which had convinced me that undirected and purposeless evolutionary processes accounted for the origin and complexity of life. Those symbols are hardly outdated. In fact, to this day those very same icons are still featured in many biology textbook s and are being seared into the minds of students around the country. But are they accurate in what they convey? What do they really tell us about the trustworthiness of Darwinism? I was thinking about this late one night wh ile I was hunched over my computer keyboard, surfing the Internet for airline tickets. Leslie stro lled into my office and peered over my shoulder. \"Where are you headed?\" she asked. \"Seattle,\" I replied. I swiveled in my chair to face her. \"There's a scientist up there who can make sense of those images of evolution that influenced me. I think I can relate to him.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Well,\" I said, \"he studied evolution as a college stude nt-and guess what happened?\" Leslie looked puzzled. \"What?\" she asked. \"He became an atheist.\" "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"INTERVIEW #1: JONATH AN WELLS, PHD, PHD Science classes weren't heavily steeped in Darwinism when Jonathan Wells was a high school student in the late 1950s, but when he be gan studying geology at Princeton University, he found that everything was viewed through evoluti onary lenses. Though he had grown up in the Presbyterian church, by the time Wells was halfway through college he considered himself to be an atheist. \"Was your atheism influenced by th e Darwinian paradigm?\" I asked. \"Oh, absolutely,\" he said. \"The evolutionary story simply replaced the religious imagery I had grown up with. I didn't need the spiritual anymore-except this vague , Gandhian, search-for- truth feeling I had.\" I was sitting with Wells in an office at the Di scovery Institute, located on the fourth floor of an obscure office building in downtown Seattle. Wells serves as a senior fellow with the Institute's Center for Science and Culture, an orga nization that neatly ble nds his dual passions for both hard science and the issue of science's influe nce on the broader society. His undergraduate degree from the University of California at Berkeley was in geology and physics, with a minor in biology. At Yale Graduate School, where he earned a doctorate in religious studies, Wells specialized in the nine teenth-century controve rsies surrounding Darwin. His book, Charles Hodge's Criti que of Darwinism, was published in 1988. 6 In 1994, Wells received a doctorate in molecula r and cell biology from Berkeley, where he focused primarily on vertebrate embryology and e volution. He later worked at Berkeley as a post-doctorate research biologist. Wells has written on the scientific and cultural aspects of evolution in such journals as Origins & Design, The Scientist, Touchstone, The American Biology Teacher, and Rhetoric and Public Affairs, while his technical articles-with such scintillating titles as \"Microtubule-mediated tran sport of organelles and localization of beta- catenin to the future dorsal side of Xenopus eggs\"-have appeared in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, Development, and BioSystems. An inveterate iconoclast, Wells doesn't shy away from controversy. Afte r a two-year stint in the Army, he became an antiwar activist at Be rkeley and ended up doing jail time for refusing to go to Vietnam as a reservist. While later living a Thoreau-like existence in a remote California cabin, he became enthralled by the grandeur of cr eation and gained new confidence that God was behind it. His spiritual interest rejuvenated, Wells explored numerous religious alternatives, vis- iting gurus, preachers, and swamis. I hadn't come to Seattle, however, to seek spir itual wisdom from Wells. Instead, I sought him out because of his scientific expertiseand becau se he authored a book whose title intrigued me the moment I first saw it. Icons of Evolution, which was published in 2000, takes a cl earheaded, scientific look at the very same visual images that had convinced me of the truth of Darwinian evolution. The Miller experiment, Darwin's tree of life, Haeckel's embryos, the archaeopteryx missing link-they were all there, along with several ot her symbols of evoluti on. The book's subtitle especially piqued my curiosity: Why Much of What We Te ach about Evolution Is Wrong. 8 Here was my chance to put these images-and the broader question of Darwinism's overall reliability-to the test. I eased into a comfortable chair that squarely faced the bearded and bespectacled Wells, who was sitti ng behind a wooden desk. He was casually dressed in a striped, short-sleeve shirt. While soft-spoken and mild-mannered as we chatted informally before our interview, he would quickly become animated as we began delving into his hot-button topic of evolutionary theory."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"I flipped through my yellow legal pa d to find a fresh page and took a pen in hand. More than thirty-five years after these icons of evolution le d me on a journey into naturalism and atheism, I was anxious to get the real story. 9 INVESTIGATING THE ICONS Starting at the beginning, I brie fly recounted for Wells how the four images of evolution had influenced my slide into atheism. In a subt le expression of empat hy, he would nod almost imperceptibly as I talked, as if to reassure me that he unders tood what I had gone through. At the conclusion of my story, I gestured toward a copy of his book that was on the desk. \"You included all four of those symbols in your book, along with several others,\" I said, \"and you called them `icons of evoluti on.' Why did you use that term?\" Wells leaned forward, putting his elbows on the desk. \"Because if you ask almost any scientist to describe the evidence for Darwinism, time after time they give these same examples,\" he said. \"They're in our textbooks. They're what we teach our students. For many scientists, they are the evidence for evolution.\" \"What are the other icons?\" \"In addition to the four that infl uenced you, there is the similarity of bone structures in a bat's wing, a porpoise's flipper, a horse's leg, and a huma n hand. This is touted as evidence of their origin in a common ancestor. Then there are the pictures in textbooks of peppered moths on tree trunks, showing how camouflage and predatory birds result in natural selection. Of course, there are Darwin's finches-the Galapagos Island birds th at are also used to support natural selection. Probably the most famous icon, though, is the draw ing we see parodied in so many cartoons-the march of ape-like creatures as they slowly evol ve into human beings, which suggests that we're merely animals that evolved by purposeless natural causes.\" I paused for a moment while I took some notes. \"Before we go any further,\" I said, \"let's get our definitions straight. When so me people say `evolution,' they m ean merely that there has been change over time. But that's not an accurate descri ption, is it?\" \"Absolutely not,\" Wells replied. \"If that's all there was to Darwinism, then there wouldn't be any controversy, because we all agree there has been biological change over time. Others define evolution as just being `descent with modification.' But again, ever yone agrees that all organisms within a single species are rela ted through descent with modificati on. This occurs in the ordinary course of biological reproduction. \"Darwinism claims much more th an that-it's the theory that all living creatures are modified descendents of a common ancestor that lived long ago. You and I, for example, are descendants of ape-like ancestors-in fact, we share a common an cestor with fruit flies. Darwinism claims that every new species that has ever appeared can be explained by descent with modification. Neo- Darwinism claims these modifications are the result of natural se lection acting on random genetic mutations.\"' \"If these icons are the illustrations most cited as evidence of evolution, then I can see why they're important,\" I said. \"What did you find as you examined them one by one?\" Wells didn't hesitate. \"That they're eith er false or misleading,\" he replied. \"False or misleading?\" I echoed. \"Wait a second -are you saying my science teacher was lying to me? That's a pretty outrageous charge!\" Wells shook his head. \"No, I'm not saying that. He probably believed in the icons too. I'm sure he wasn't even aware of the way they misreprese nt the evidence. But the end result is the same- much of what science teachers have been tel ling students is simply wrong. A lot of what you"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"personally were told about the icons , for instance, is probably false.\" I considered the implications for a moment. \"Okay, let me follo w your logic,\" I said. \"If these icons are cited by scientists so often because they're among the best evidence for Darwinism-\" \"-And if they're either false or misleading,\" he said, picking up my t hought, \"then what does that tell us about evolut ionary theory? That's the point. The qu estion I'm raising is whether all of this is really science-or is it actually a kind of mythology?\" That's the very question I wanted to pursue. I d ecided that my approach would be to ask Wells for the straight story on each of the icons that especially influenced me. I started with the one that had the biggest impact: the picture of the tubes, flasks, and electrodes of Stanley Miller's 1953 experiment in which he shot electricity through an atmosphere like the one on the prim acids-the building blocks of life. The clear implication-that life could be create d naturalistically, without the intervention of a Creator-had been largely responsible fo r untethering me from my need for God. IMAGE #1: THE MILLER EXPERIMENT Obviously, the significance of Mille r's experiment-which to this day is still featured in many biology textbooks-hinges on whether he used an atmosphere that accurately simulated the environment of the early earth. At the time, Miller was relying heavily on the atmospheric theories of his doctoral advisor, Nobel laureate Harold Urey. \"What's the best scientific assessment today? \" I asked Wells. \"Did Miller use the correct atmosphere or not?\" Wells leaned back in his chair. \"Well, nobody k nows for sure what the early atmosphere was like, but the consensus is that the atmosphere wa s not at all like the one Miller used,\" he began. \"Miller chose a hydrogen-rich mixture of meth ane, ammonia, and water vapor, which was consistent with what many scientists thought back then. But scientists don't believe that anymore. As a geophysicist with the Carneg ie Institution said in the 1960s , `What is the evidence for a primitive methane-ammonia atmosphere on earth? The answer is that there is no evidence for it, but much against it.\" \"By the mid-1970s, Belgian biochemist Marcel Fl orkin was declaring that the concept behind Miller's theory of the early atmosphere `has been abandoned.' 12 Two of the leading origin-of-life researchers, Klaus Dose and Sidney Fox, c onfirmed that Miller had used the wrong gas mixture. 13 And Science magazine said in 1995 that experts now dismiss Miller's experiment because `the early atmosphere looked nothing like the Miller-Urey simulation.'\" 74 I asked, \"What's the current thinking of scient ists concerning the gas content of the early earth?\" \"The best hypothesis now is that there was ve ry little hydrogen in th e atmosphere because it would have escaped into space. Instead, the atmosphere probably consisted of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water vapor,\" Wells said. \"So my gripe is that textbooks still present the Miller experiment as though it reflected the earth's early environment, when most geochemists since the 1960s would say it was tota lly unlike Miller's.\" I asked the next logica l question: \"What happens if you replay the experiment using an accurate atmosphere?\" \"I'll tell you this: you do not get amino acids, that's for sure,\" he replied. \"Some textbooks fudge by saying, well, even if you use a realistic atmosphere, you still get organic molecules, as if that solves the problem.\" Actually, that sounded promising. \"Organic molecules?\" I said. \"I'm not a biochemist, but"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"couldn't those be precursors to life?\" Wells recoiled. \"That's what they sound like, but do you know what they are? Formaldehyde! Cyanide!\" he declared, his voice rising for emphasis . \"They may be organic molecules, but in my lab at Berkeley you couldn't even have a capped bottle of formaldehyde in the room, because the stuff is so toxic. You open the bottle and it fries pr oteins all over the place, just from the fumes. It kills embryos. The idea that us ing a realistic atmosphere gets you the first step in the origin of life is just laughable. \"Now, it's true that a good organic chemist can turn formaldehyde and cyanide into biological molecules. But to suggest that formaldehyde a nd cyanide give you the right substrate for the origin of life,\" he said, breaking into a chuckle, \"Well, it's just a joke.\" He let the point sink in before delivering the clincher. \"Do you know what you get?\" he asked. \"Embalming fluid!\" PUTTING HUMPTY-DUMPTY TOGETHER The march of science has clearly left Miller's experiment in th e dust, even if some textbooks haven't yet noticed. But I wanted to press on and test other scenarios. \"Let's say that a scientist someday actually ma nages to produce amino ac ids from a realistic atmosphere of the early earth,\" I began. I could see Wells was ready to in terrupt, so I preempted him: \"Look, I understand it's not chemically possible, but let's say it was. Or let's say amino acids came to earth in a comet or some other way. My question is this: how fa r would that be from creating a living cell?\" \"Oh,\" he said as he pounced on the question, \"Very far. Incredibly far. That would be the first step in an extremely complicated process. You w ould have to get the right number of the right kinds of amino acids to link up to create a protein molecule-and th at would still be a long way from a living cell. Then you'd need dozens of protein molecules, ag ain in the right sequence, to create a living cell. The odds against this are astonishing. The gap between nonliving chemicals and even the most primitive living or ganism is absolutely tremendous.\" I needed a visual picture to help me understa nd this. \"Can you give me an illustration?\" I asked. \"Let me describe it this way,\" he said. \"Put a sterile, balanced salt solution in a test tube. Then put in a single living cell an d poke a hole in it so that its c ontents leak into the solution. Now the test tube has all the molecules you would need to create a living cell, right? You would already have accomplished far more than what the Miller experiment ever could-you've got all the components you need for life.\" I nodded. \"That's right.\" \"The problem is you can't make a living cell,\" he said. \"There's not even any point in trying. It would be like a physicis t doing an experiment to see if he ca n get a rock to fall upwards all the way to the moon. No biologist in his right mind would think you can take a test tube with those molecules and turn them into a living cell.\" \"In other words,\" I said, \"if you want to create life, on top of the challenge of somehow generating the cellular components out of nonliving chemicals, you would have an even bigger problem in trying to put the ingred ients together in the right way.\" \"Exactly! In my illustration, the cell is dead, and you can't put Humpty-Dumpty back together again. So even if you could accomplish th e thousands of steps between the amino acids in the Miller tar-which probably didn't exist in the real world anyway-and the components you need for a living cell-all the enzymes, the DNA, a nd so forth-you're still immeasurably far from"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"life.\" \"But,\" I protested, \"the first cell was probably a lot more primitive than even the simplest single-cell organism today.\" \"Granted,\" he said. \"But my point remains the same-the problem of assembling the right parts in the right way at the right time and at the right place, while keeping out the wrong material, is simply insurmountable. Frankly, the idea that we'r e on the verge of explaining the origin of life naturalistically is just silly to me.\" \"There's no theory, then, that can account for how life could have naturally come together by itself without any direction or guidance?\" Wells stroked his salt-and-pepper beard. \"The word `theory' is very slippery,\" he replied. \"I can make up a story, but it would be unsupported at every crucial step by any experimental evidence worth counting. I'm an ex perimentalist at heart. I'd want to see some evidence-and it's just not there. \"For instance, one popular theory was that RNA, a close rela tive of DNA, could have been a molecular cradle from which early cells deve loped. This `RNA world' hypothesis was heralded as a great possibility for a while. But nobody c ould demonstrate how RNA could have formed before living cells were around to make it, or how it could have survived under the conditions on the early earth. \"Gerald Joyce, a biochemist at the Scripps Research Institute, ruled out the RNA-first theory very colorfully by saying, `You have to build straw man upon straw man to get to the point where RNA is a viable first biomolecule.' 15 \"In short,\" declared Wells, \"it was a dead end-as all other theories have been.\" \"... AND HENCE A MIRACLE\" In hindsight, my materialistic philosophy had been built on a foundation that history has subsequently dismantled piece by piece. Miller's experiment, once a great ally to my atheism, has been reduced to a mere scientific curiosity. \"What is the significance of his experiment today?\" I asked Wells. \"To me, it has virtually no scien tific significance,\" he replied. \"I t's historically interesting, because it convinced a lot of people through the years-yourself included-that life could have arisen spontaneously, a point which I believe is fa lse. Does it have a place in a science textbook? Maybe as a footnote.\" \"But it's more than a footnot e in most texts, right?\" \"Unfortunately, yes,\" he said. \"It's prominen tly featured in current textbooks, often with pictures. The most generous thi ng I can say is that it's mislead ing. It's wrong to even give the impression that science has empirically shown how life could have originated. Now, they may have a disclaimer buried in the text, saying th e earth's atmosphere may not have been what Miller thought it was. But then they say that if a realistic environment is used, you still get organic molecules. To me, th at's just as misleading.\" I thought about a student who en counters the Miller experiment today. Would he gloss over in his mind the complexities of creating life ? Would he understand the nuances of the Miller story, or would he hear the term \"organic mol ecules\" and conclude that scientists are on the verge of resolving the problem of how nonliving chemicals somehow became living cells? Would a young person looking for an excuse to es cape the accountability of God cling to the false conclusion that the origin-of-life problem is only a minor obstacle in the relentless march of evolutionary theory?"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"\"Why do you think the Miller experiment is still published in textbooks?\" I asked. Wells shrugged. \"It's becoming clearer and cleare r to me that this is materialistic philosophy masquerading as empirical scienc e. The attitude is that life had to have developed this way because there's no other materialistic explanation. And if you try to invoke another explanation- for instance, intelligent design-then the evolutionists claim you're not a scientist.\" Wells's explanation was consistent with anothe r interview I had conducted with origin-of-life expert Walter Bradley, a former professor at Texas A&M Universit y, who co-authored the landmark 1984 book The Mystery of Life's Origin. I questioned Bradley about the va rious theories advanced by scientists for how the first living cell could have been naturalistically generated- including random chance, chemical affinity, self- ordering tendencies, seeding from space, deep-s ea ocean vents, and using clay to encourage prebiotic chemicals to assemble-and he demons trated that not one of them can withstand scientific scrutiny.' 7 Many other scientists have reached that same conclusion. \"Science doesn't have the slightest idea how life began,\" journalist Gregg Easter brook wrote about the origin-of-life field. \"No generally accepted theory exists, and the steps leading from a barren primordial world to the fragile chemistry of life seem imponderable.” Bradley not only shares that view, but he sa id that the mindboggling difficulties in bridging the yawning gap between nonlife and life mean that there may very well be no potential of ever finding a theory for how life could have arisen spontaneously. That's why he's convinced that the \"absolutely overwhelming evidence\" points toward an intelligence behind life's creation. In fact, he said: \"I think people who believe that life emerged naturalistically need to have a great deal more faith than people who reasonabl y infer that there's an Intelligent Designer.\" 19 Even those who look askance at religious faith have been for ced to conclude that the odds against the spontaneous creation of life are so absurdly high that there must be more to the creation story than mere materialistic processes. They can't help but invoke the only word that seems to realistically account for it all: miracle. It's a label many scientists are loathe to use but which the circumstances seem to demand. For instance, one of the country's leading science journalists, John Horgan, who identifies himself as a \"lapsed Catholic,\" conceded in 2002 that scientists have no idea how the universe was created or \"how inanimate matter on our little planet coalesced into living creatures.\" Then came that word: \"Science, you might say, has di scovered that our existence is infinitely improbable, and hence a miracle.\" 20 Even biochemist and spiritual skeptic Fran cis Crick, who shared the Nobel Prize for discovering the molecular structur e of DNA, cautiously invoked th e word a few years ago. \"An honest man, armed with all the knowledge available to us now, could only state that in some sense, the origin of life appears at the moment to be almost a miracle, so many are the conditions which would have had to have been satisfied to get it going,\" he said. 21 Others are more adamant. \"If there isn't a natura l explanation and there doesn't seem to be the potential of finding one, then I belie ve it's appropriate to look at a supernatural explanation,\" said Bradley. \"I think that's the most reasonable inference based on the evidence.\" 22 IMAGE #2: DARWIN'S TREE OF LIFE It was time to advance to the next image of e volution. One of the most recognizable icons is the drawing Darwin sketched for The Origin of Species to illustrate his theory that all living creatures had a common ancestor and that natural selection drove the eventual development of"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"the countless organisms we see in the modern worl d. To me, his sketch of the evolutionary tree encapsulated why Darwinian evolution was so co mpelling: it seemed to explain everything in natural history. The question, though, is whether the tree represents reality. \"We now have more than a century of fossil disc overies since Darwin drew his picture,\" I said to Wells. \"Has this evol utionary tree held up?\" \"Absolutely not,\" came his quick reply. \"As an illustration of the fossil record, the Tree of Life is a dismal failure. But it is a good representation of Darwin's theory. \"You see, he believed that if a population was exposed to one set of conditions, and another part of the population experienced other conditions, then natural selectio n could modify the two populations in different ways. Over time, one sp ecies could produce several varieties, and if these varieties continued to diverge, they would eventually become separate species. That's why his drawing was in the patte rn of a branching tree. \"A key aspect of his theory was that natural selection would act, in his own words, `slowly by accumulating slight, successive, favorable variations' and that `no great or sudden modifications' were possible.\" I didn't want to miss the significance of what Wells was claiming. \"You're saying that the tree of life illustrates Darwin's ideas but that hi s theory is not supported by the physical evidence scientists have found in fossils?\" \"That's right,\" he continued. \"In fact, Darwin knew the fossil record failed to support his tree. He acknowledged that major groups of animals- he calls them divisions, now they're called phyla-appear suddenly in the fossil record. 23 That's not what his theory predicts. \"His theory predicts a long history of gradual divergence from a common ancestor, with the differences slowly becoming bigge r and bigger until you get the ma jor differences we have now. The fossil evidence, even in his day, showed th e opposite: the rapid appearance of phylum-level differences in what's called the `Cambrian explosion.' \"Darwin believed that future fossil discoveries would vindicate his theory-but that hasn't happened. Actually, fossil discoveries over the last hundred and fifty years have turned his tree upside down by showing the Cambrian explosion was even more abrupt and extensive than scientists once thought.\" That begged for further explanation. \"Elabor ate on the Cambrian explosion,\" I said. \"The Cambrian was a geological period that we think began a little more than 540 million years ago. The Cambrian explosion has been calle d the `Biological Big Bang' because it gave rise to the sudden appearance of mo st of the major animal phyla that are still alive today, as well as some that are now extinct.\" Wells said. \"Here's what the record shows: there were so me jellyfish, sponges, and worms prior to the Cambrian, although there's no evidence to support Da rwin's theory of a long history of gradual divergence. \"Then at the beginning of the Cambrian-boom!-all of a sudden, we see representatives of the arthropods, modern representatives of which are insects, crabs, and the like; echinoderms, which include modern starfish and sea urchins; chordates, which include modern verteb rates; and so forth. Mammals came later, but the chordates-the major group to which they belong-were right there at the beginning of the Cambrian. \"This is absolutely contrary to Darwin's Tree of Life. These animals, which are so fundamentally different in their body plans, ap pear fully developed, all of a sudden, in what paleontologists have called the single most spectacul ar phenomenon of the fossil record.\" Spectacular, indeed. It was staggering! But I was having trouble thinking in vast geological"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"terms, where words like \"sudden\" and \"abrupt\" ha ve meanings quite different from how we might use them in everyday conve rsation. I needed more clarity. \"How suddenly did these animals come onto the scene?\" I asked Wells. \"Put it into context for me.\" \"Okay,\" he said. His eyes swept the room, looking for a suitable illustration. Finding none, he turned to me and asked: \"Are you a football fan?\" I felt trapped. I didn't want to admit that I've followed the hapless Chicago Bears ever since I was a teenager. 24 After all, my credibility was at stake! So I kept my answer vague: \"Uh, yeah, I like the game.\" \"Okay,\" he said, \"imagine yourself on one goal line of a football field. That line represents the first fossil, a microscopic, single-celled organism. Now start marching down the field. You pass the twentyyard line, the forty-yard line, you pass midfield, and you're approaching the other goal line. All you've seen this entire time are these microscopic, single-celled organisms. \"You come to the sixteen-yard line on the far end of the field, and now you see these sponges and maybe some jellyfish and worms. Then-boom!-in the space of a single stride, all these other forms of animals suddenly appear . As one evolutionary scientis t said, the major animal groups `appear in the fossil record as Athena did from the head of Zeus-full blown and raring to go.' 25 \"Now, nobody can call that a branching tree! Some paleontologists, even though they may think Darwin's overall theory is correct, call it a la wn rather than a tree, because you have these separate blades of grass sprouting up. One paleontologist in China says it actually stands Darwin's tree on its head, because the major groups of animals-instead of coming last, at the top of the tree-come first, when anim als make their first appearance. \"Either way, the result is the same: the Camb rian explosion has uprooted Darwin's tree.\" THE HYPOTHESIS FAILS There seemed, however, to be an easy comeback. \"Maybe,\" I said, \"Darwin was right after all-the fossil record is still incomplete. Who kno ws how natural history might be rewritten next week by a discovery that will be made in a fossil dig somewhere? Or perhaps,\" I speculated, \"the organisms that existed prior to the Biological Big Bang were too small or th eir bodies were too soft to have left any trac e in the fossil record.\" Having raised those objections, I sat back in my chair. \"Frank ly, you can't prove otherwise,\" I said, my words almost a taunt. Wells yielded a little. \"As a scientist,\" he conced ed, \"I have to leave ope n the possibility that next year someone will discover a fossil bed in th e Congo or somewhere that will suddenly fill in the gaps.\" I nodded at his admission. However, he wasn't finished. \"But I sure don't think that's likely,\" he added. \"It hasn't happened af ter all this time, and millions of fossils have already been dug up. Th ere are certainly enough good sedimentary rocks from before the Cambrian era to have preserved an cestors if there were a ny. I have to agree with two experts in the field who said that the Cambri an explosion is `too big to be masked by flaws in the fossil record.' 26 \"As for the pre-Cambrian fossils being too ti ny or soft to be pres erved-well, we have microfossils of bacteria in rock s dating back more than three bill ion years. And there have been soft-bodied organisms from before the Cambrian that have been found in Australia. In fact, scientists have found soft-bodied animals in the Cambrian explosi on itself. So I don't think that's a very good explanation, either. Today evolutionist s are turning to molecula r evidence to try to"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"show there was a common ancesto r prior to the Cambrian.\" \"How does that work?\" I asked. \"Not very well,\" he quipped. \"But here's the process: you can't get mo lecular evidence from the fossils themselves; all of it comes from living organisms. You take a mo lecule that's basic to life-say, ribosomal RNA-and you examine it in a star fish, and then you study its equivalent in a snail, a worm, and a frog. You're looking for si milarities. If you compar e this one molecule across different categories of animal body plan s and find similarities, and if you make the assumption that they came from a common an cestor, then you can construct a theoretical evolutionary tree. \"But there are too many problems with this. If you compare this molecular tree with a tree based on anatomy, you get a differe nt tree. You can examine anothe r molecule and come up with another tree altogether. In fact , if you give one molecule to tw o different laboratories, you can get two different trees. There's no consistency, including with the dating. It's all over the board. Based on all this, I think it's reasonable for me, as a scientist, to say that maybe we should ques- tion our assumption that this common ancestor exists.\" Wells stopped for a moment. He apparently felt some elaboration was in order. \"Of course, descent from a common ancestor is true at some levels,\" he continued. \"Nobody denies that. For example, we can trace generations of fruit flies to a common ances tor. Within a single species, common ancestry has been observed directly. And it's possible that all the cats-tigers, lions, and so on-descended from a common an cestor. While that's not a fact, it might be a reasonable inference based on interbreeding. \"So as we go up these different levels in the taxonomic hierarchy-species, genus, family, order, class-common ancestry is certainly true at th e species level, but is it true at higher levels? It becomes an increasingly uncertain inferenc e the higher we go in th e taxonomic hierarchy. When you get to the level of phyla, the major an imal groups, it's a very, very shaky hypothesis. In fact, I would say it's disconfirmed. The evidence just doesn't support it.\" The facts were compelling. Nobody can claim that Da rwin's tree is an accu rate description of what the fossil record has produced. Protestations from Darwinists aside, the evidence has failed to substantiate the predictions that Darwin made. Yet when I encountered the drawing as a student, I walked away with the conclusion that it illustrated the success of his revolutionary ideas. \"Is the drawing still featured in textbooks today?\" I asked. \"Not only is it included in the textbooks, but it's called a fact,\" Wells replied, sounding genuinely astonished. \"I don't mind that it's shown; I think it's a good illustration of an interesting theory. What I mind is when textbooks call it a fact that all animals share a common a ncestor. Well, it's not a fact!\" he declared, his voice punctuating his point. \"If you consider all of the evidence, Darwin's tree is false as a description of the history of life. I'll even go further than that: it's not even a good hypothesi s at this point.\" IMAGE #3: HAECKEL'S EMBRYOS Like every young student of evolution, Wells ha d seen Ernst Haeckel's comparative drawings of embryos, often described as among the best evid ence for Darwinism. But it wasn't until Wells was working on his doctorate in vertebrate embr yology that he saw the sketches for what they really were. Haeckel's most renowned images depict the embr yos of a fish, salamander, tortoise, chicken, hog, calf, rabbit, and human side-byside at three stages of development. The illustrations support"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Darwin's assertion that the striking similarities between early embryos is \"by far the strongest single class of facts\" in favor of his theory that all organisms share a universal ancestor. I was mesmerized by the nineteen th-century drawings when I first encountered them as a student. As I carefully compared the embryos at their earliest stage, looking back and forth from one to the other, I could see they were virtually indistinguishable. I searched my mind, but I couldn't think of any logical explanation for th is phenomenon other than a common ancestor. My verdict was swift: Darwin prevails. The real explanation, as it turns out, would have been far too bizarre for me to have even considered at the time. \"When you saw these drawings,\" I said to Wells , \"did you have the same reaction that I did- that this was strong evidence for Darwinism?\" \"Yes, I did, the first time I looked at them,\" Wells answered. \"It wasn't until I was doing my graduate work that I began to compare actual photographs of embryos to what Haeckel had drawn.\" \"And what did you find?\" \"I was stunned!\" he said, his eyes widening. \"They didn't fit. There was a big discrepancy. It was really hard to believe.\" As he described what had happened, I slow ly shook my head in amazement at the implications of what he was sa ying. \"I sort of ra tionalized by saying, we ll, textbooks tend to oversimplify things,\" he continued. \"But ove r time it bothered me more and more.\" I was hungry for details. \"What was it spec ifically that bothered you?\" I asked. \"There are three problems with these drawings,\" he said. \"The first is that the similarities in the early stages were faked.\" He leveled the accusation without emotion in his voice, but nevertheless it was a stunning charge. \"Faked?\" I repeated. \"Are you sure?\" It seemed inconceivable that the books I had relied upon as a student could have so blatantly misled me. \"You can call them fudged, distorted, misleading, but the bottom line is that they were faked,\" he replied. \"Apparently in some cases Haeckel actually used the same woodcut to print embryos from different classes because he was so confident of his theory that he figured he didn't have to draw them separately. In othe r cases he doctored the drawings to make them look more similar than they really are. At a ny rate, his drawings misrepresent the embryos.\" \"That's amazing!\" I said. \"How long has this been known?\" \"The y were first exposed in the late 1860s, when his colleagues accused him of fraud.\" I cocked my head. \"Wait a minute-I saw these dr awings in books that I studied when I was a student in the 1960s and '70s more than a hundred years later. How is that possible?\" \"It's worse than that!\" he declared. \"They're still being used, even in upper-division textbooks on evolutionary biology. In fact, I analyzed a nd graded ten recent text books on how accurately they dealt with this topic. I had to give eight of them an F. Two others did only slightly better; I gave them a D.\" Anger was brewing inside of me. I had bought into Darwinism-and subsequently atheism- partially on the basis of drawings that scientists had known for a century were doctored. \"This is really hard to believe,\" I sa id. \"Doesn't it make you mad?\" \"Of course it does, because I was raised on this stuff too. I was misled,\" he said. \"There was no excuse for it. When some biologists expose d this in an article a few years ago, the evolutionist Stephen Jay Gould of Harvard co mplained that this was nothing new. He had known about it for twenty years! It was no secret to the experts."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"\"But then why was it still in textbooks? Even Gould said textbook writers should be ashamed of the way the drawings had been mindlessly recycled for over a century. At leas t he was honest enough to call it what it was: `the academic equivalent of murder.' THE SINS OF HAECKEL Wells's first disclosure about Haeckel's embryos was a stunner, but he had said there were a total of three problems with the drawings. I coul dn't wait to hear him address the others. \"What are the other two problems?\" I asked. \"The minor problem is that Haeckel cherry-pic ked his examples,\" Wells explained. \"He only shows a few of the seven vertebrate classes. Fo r example, his most famous rendition has eight columns. Four are mammals, but they're all pl acental mammals. There are two other kinds of mammals that he didn't show, which are differe nt. The remaining four classes he showed- reptiles, birds, amphibians, and fish-happen to be more similar than the ones he omitted. He used a salamander to represent amphibians instead of a frog, which looks very different. So he stacked the deck by picking representatives that came closest to fitting hi s idea-and then he went further by faking the similarities.\" That sounded like a pretty serious breach of scie ntific protocol to me. \"If that's the minor problem,\" I said sarcastically, \"then what's the major one?\" Wells moved to the edge of his chair; clearl y, this was tapping into his passion area. \"To me, as an embryologist, the most dramatic problem is that what Haeckel claime d is the early stage of development is nothing of the sort . It's actually the midpoint of de velopment,\" he explained. \"If you go back to the earlier stages, the embryos look far more different from each other. But he deliberately omits the earlier stages altogether.\" I didn't immediately catch the full signifi cance of this. \"Why is that important?\" \"Remember Darwin claimed that because the embr yos are most similar in their early stages, this is evidence of common ances try. He thought that the early stage showed what the common ancestor looked like-sort of like a fish. \"But embryologists talk about the `developmenta l hourglass,' which refers to the shape of an hourglass, with its width repres enting the measure of difference. You see, vertebrate embryos start out looking very different in the early cell division stages. The cell divisions in a mammal, for example, are radically different from those in any of the other classes. There's no possible way you could mix them up. In fact, it's extremely di fferent within classes. The patterns are all over the place. \"Then at the midpoint-which is what Haeckel claimed in his drawings was the early stage- the embryos become more similar, though nowhere near as much as Haeckel claimed. Then they become very different again.\" What a devastating critique! Haeckel's draw ings, which had been published countless times over more than a century, had failed on three levels . I couldn't help but ask Wells: \"If they're so misleading, then why did scientists continue to publish them for genera tion after generation of students?\" \"One explanation that's often given,\" he replied, \"is that although the drawings are false, they teach a concept that's basically true. Well, this is not true. Biologists know that embryos are not most similar in their earliest stages.\" With that, Wells picked up his book from the desk and flipped to the chapter on Haeckel. \"Yet listen to this: one textbook shows Haeckel's dr awings and says, `Early developmental stages of animals whose adult forms appear radically di fferent are often surpri singly similar.' One 1999"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"textbook has a slightly redrawn version of Haecke l's work and tells students, `Notice that the early embryonic stages of these vertebrates bear a striking resemblance to each other.' \"Another textbook accompanies its drawings with the statement: `The early embryos of vertebrates strongly resemble one another.' Another says flatly: `One fact of embryology that pushed Darwin toward the idea of evolution is that the early embryos of mo st vertebrates closely resemble one another.' ' Wells snapped the book shut. \"As I said, it's just false that embryos are most similar in their earliest development. Of course, some Darwin ists try to get around Haeckel's problems by changing their tune. They use evol utionary theory to try to expl ain why the differences in the embryos are there. They can get quite elaborate,\" he said. \"But that's doing the same thing that the theory-savers were doing with the Cambrian explosion. What was supposed to be primary evid ence for Darwin's theory-the fossil or embryo evidence-turns out to be false, so they immediat ely say, well, we know the theory's true, so let's use the theory to explain why the evidence doesn't fit. \"But then, where's the evidence for the theory?\" he demanded, sounding both frustrated and perturbed. \"That's what I'd like to know. Why shoul d I accept the theory as being true at all?\" THE TRUTH ABOUT GILLS Wells's explanation made me feel foolish for ever having believed the embryo drawings I had seen as a student, much less the previous two icons that Wells had already deconstructed. I felt a little like the victim of a con game, blaming my self for being so uncritical and naive in accepting what evolution textbooks and biology teachers had told me. But Haekel's drawings weren't the only eviden ce I had been taught about universal ancestry. I also had been told a fascinating fact that helped convince me that our pr ogenitors dwelled in the ocean: all human embryos, so my teachers said, go through a stage in which they actually develop gill-like structures on their necks. The encyclopedia I consulted as a youngster decl ared unequivocally th at \"the fetuses of mammals at one stage have gill slits which resemb le those of fish,\" whic h to me was dramatic confirmation of our aquatic ancestry. 29 In 1996, Life magazine described how human embryos grow \"something very much like gills,\" which is \"some of the most compelling evidence of evolution.\" 30 Even some contemporary biology textbooks assert that human embryos have \"gill pouches\" or \"gill slits.\" 31 This colorful tidbit stayed with me from the fi rst time I heard it. \"Aren' t gills strong evidence that our ancestors lived in the ocean?\" I asked Wells. He sighed. Apparently, I was not the first person to raise this issue with him. \"Yes, that's the standard argument, but-here,\" he said, gesturing toward me, \"L ook down toward your navel for a moment.\" Feeling a little awkward, I bowed my head. \"Now, feel your neck,\" he said. \"There are ridges in the skin, right?\" I nodded. \"Well, if you look at an embryo, it's doubled over. It has ridges in the neck. I'm not saying they're only skin folds; they're more complicated th an that. But it's just an anatomical feature that grows out of the fact that this is how vertebrate embryos develop. \"Let me be clear: they're not gills!\" he stressed. \"Even fish don't have gills at that stage. In humans, the ridges become one thing; in fish, they become gills. They're not even gill slits. To call them gilllike structures is me rely reading evolutionary theory back into the evidence. They're never gill-like except in the superficial sense th at they're lines in the neck area. As British embryologist Lewis Wolpert said, the resemblance is only illusory. 32"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"\"It's interesting how these misconceptions cont inue to thrive,\" he went on. \"Evolutionists used to teach that famous phrase 'ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny,' which is a fancy way of saying that embryos repeat their evolutionary history by passing through the adult forms of their ancestors as they develop. \"But this theory has been widely dismissed for many decades, because it's empirically false. Even so, there are aspects of it that still come up. And `gill slit s' would be a prime example of that.\" WING, FLIPPER, LEG, HAND Earlier in our interview, Wells had brought up another category of evidence for universal ancestry: homology in vertebrate limbs. I rememb er as a student seeing the drawings depicting the similar bone structures in a bat's wing, a porpo ise's flipper, a horse's leg, and a human's hand. I was told that even though these limbs have b een adapted for different uses, their underlying similarity-or \"homology\"-is proof that they all share a common ancestor. Wells had briefly mentioned this phenomenon at the outset of our interv iew. \"Isn't homology good evidence for Darwinism?\" I asked. \"Actually, these homologies were described a nd named by Darwin's predecessors-and they were not evolutionists,\" he replied. \"Richard Owen, who was the most famous anatomist of Darwin's time, said they pointed toward a comm on archetype or design, not toward descent with modification.\" \"But,\" I protested, \"the similar ities are there-you can't deny that.\" \"Yes, but the explanation can go either way: design or descent with modification. How do we determine which is true? Listen-similarity al one doesn't tell us. Look at Berra's Blunder.\" He threw out that comment assuming I would know what he was referring to. Although the term sounded vaguely familiar, I couldn't pinpoint what it meant. \"Berra's Blunder?\" I asked. \"What's that?\" \"Phillip Johnson coined that term based on a book that was written by a biologist named Tim Berra in 1990. Berra compared the fossil record to a series of automobile models, saying that if you compare a 1953 and 1954 Corvette si de by side, and then a 1954 and 1955 Corvette and so on, then it becomes obvious that there has b een descent with modification. He said this is what paleontologists do with fossi ls, `and the evidence is so solid and comprehensive that it can- not be denied by reasonable people.' 33 \"Far from demonstrating his point, the illust ration shows that a desi gner could have been involved,\" Wells said. \"These successive models of the Corvette are based on plans drawn up by engineers, so there's intelligence at work to gu ide and implement the process. If you wanted to demonstrate that the similar feat ures resulted from a Darwinian process, you would have to show that once you somehow got an au tomobile, the na tural forces of rust, wind, water, and gravity would turn one model into its successor. \"The point I want to make is this: quite unintentionally, Berra had illustrated the fact that merely having a succession of similar forms does not provide its own explanation. A mechanism is needed. With the Corvette, that mechanism is human manufacturing.\" \"What mechanism is proposed for Darwinism?\" I asked. \"One is called `common developmental pathways ,' which means if you have two different animals with homologous features and you trace them back to the embryo, they would come from similar cells and processes. This happens to be mostly untrue. \"I mentioned frogs earlier. There are some frogs that develop like frog s and other frogs that"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"develop like birds, but they all look pretty much the same when they come out the other end. They're frogs. So the developmental pathway explanation is false- I don't know anybody who studies development and takes it seriously. \"A more common explanation nowadays is that the homologies come from similar genes. In other words, the reason two features are homol ogous in two different animals would be that they're programmed by similar genes in the embryo. But it turns out this doe sn't work very well, either. We know some cases where you have similar features that come from different genes, but we have lots and lots of cases where we have similar genes that give rise to very different features. \"I'll give you an example: eyes. There's a gene th at's similar in mice, octopuses, and fruit flies. If you look at a mouse eye and an octopus eye, there's a superficial similarity, which is odd because nobody thinks their common ancestor had an eye like that. What's more striking is if you look at a fruit fly's eye-a compound eye with multiple facets-it's totally diffe rent. Yet all three of these eyes depend on the same or very similar gene. \"In fact, it's so similar that you can put the mouse gene into a fruit fly that's missing that gene and you can get the fruit fly to de velop its eyes as it normally w ould. The genes are that similar. So neither the developmental pathway explana tion nor the similar gene explanation really accounts for homology.\" I asked, \"What's the answer, then?\" Wells shrugged. \"Frankly, it remains a myster y. If you read the literature on homology, the experts know it's a mystery. They may not give up Darwinism, but they know they haven't solved the problem. To me, if you haven't solved the problem of a mechanism, then you haven't distinguished between common descent and co mmon design. It could be either one. The evidence isn't pointing one way or the other. \"I think students deserve to know that scientists haven't resolved this problem. Instead, some textbooks simply define homology as similarity due to common ancestry. So the theory becomes true by definition. What the textbook is saying is that similarity due to common ancestry is due to common ancestry. And that's circular reasoning.\" HUMAN GENES, APE GENES Since Wells had brought up genetics, I was remi nded of another questi on I wanted to raise with him about the theory of common descent. \"What about recen t genetic studies that show humans and apes share ninety-eight or ninety-nine percen t of their genes?\" I asked. \"Isn't that evidence that we share a common ancestor?\" \"If you assume, as neo-Darwinism does, that we are products of our genes, then you're saying that the dramatic differences between us and chimpanzees are due to two percent of our genes,\" he replied. \"The problem is that the so-called bo dy-building genes are in th e ninety-eight percent. The two percent of genes that are different are really rather trivial genes that have little to do with anatomy. So the supposed similarity of human and chimpanzee DNA is a problem for neo- Darwinism right there. \"Second, it's not surprising that when you l ook at two organisms that are similar anatomically, you often find they're similar ge netically. Not always; there's a striking discordance with some organisms. But does this prove common ancestry?\" He shook his head as he answered his own que stion: \"No, it's just as compatible with common design as it is with common ancestry. A designer might very well decide to use common building materials to create different organisms, dust as builders use the same"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"materials-steel girders, rivets, and so forth-to build different bridges that end up looking very dissimilar from one another.\" As I mentally wrestled with this concept, I stood to stretch my legs. Walking over to the window, I looked down at cars backed up along the busy street and people hustling down the sidewalks on either side. A rudiment ary illustration popped into my mind. \"Let me see if I understand you. If I were to chem ically analyze that street and sidewalk,\" I said, pointing out the window, \"I'd find they would be identical or very si milar. They'd both be made of concrete. But that wouldn't mean that they shared a common ancestorsay, a path for a golf cart-that got wider and more substantial over millions of years. A better explanation would be that there was a common designer who decided to use basically the same materials to con- struct similar, but functionally different, structures.\" Wells thought about my example for a moment. \"E ssentially, that's right, \" he said. \"It sounds ridiculous to suggest a golf path could evolve into a sidewalk and street, but it's not any more outlandish than some of the claims for biological evolution. The important poi nt is that similarity by itself doesn't distinguish be tween design and Darwinism.\" We had strayed from Haeckel's embryos, but the issues were the same: is there persuasive evidence through embryology or homology that all living creatures evolved over time from an ancient progenitor? I concluded that Darwin was wrong: examining embryos of different creatures in their ea rly stages does not yield support fo r his theory. And the undeniable similarities between some vertebrate limbs cer tainly doesn't distinguish between design or descent as a cause. Once again, the persuasive powe r of the evolutionary icons had been deflated. I glanced at my watch; if I were to catch my pl ane back to Los Angeles, I would need to turn to the last of the four evolutionary images from my days as a student: th e awe-inspiring fossil of a prehistoric creature that once effectiv ely silenced many of Darwin's critics. IMAGE #4: THE ARCHAEOPTERYX MISSING LINK When Darwin's The Origin of Species was published in 1859, he conceded that \"the most obvious and gravest objection which can be urged against my theory\" was that the fossil record failed to back up his evolutionary hypothesis. \"Why,\" he asked, \"if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumera ble transitional forms?\" He attributed the problem to the fossil record being incomplete a nd predicted that future discoveries would vindi- cate his theory. As if on cue, two years later scientists unearthed the archaeopteryx (pronounced ar-key-OPT er-icks) in a German quarry. Darwin's supporte rs were thrilled-surely this missing link between reptiles and modern birds, unveil ed so promptly after the app earance of Darwin's book, would just be the first of many future fossil discoveries that would valid ate Darwin's claims. Like many people, including the sc ientist who \"actually fell upon his knees in awe\" when he first glimpsed the archaeopteryx at the National History Museum in England,34 I was enthralled by the dramatic pictures of the prehistoric creature. I was under the impression that it was featured in my books on evolutio n because it is just one exampl e of many transitio nal links that have been found. But I was wrong. Since that time I have come to learn that the fossil record has utterly let Darwin down. Michael Denton, in his book Evolution: A Theory in Crisis, summarized the bleak situation this way: ... [T]he universal experience of paleontology ... [is that] while the rocks have continually"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"yielded new and exciting and even bizarre forms of life ... what they have never yielded is any of Darwin's myriads of transitional forms. Despite the tremendous increase in geological activity in every corner of the gl obe and despite the disc overy of many strange and hitherto unknown forms, the infinitude of connecting links has still not been dis- covered and the fossil record is about as di scontinuous as it was when Darwin was writing the Origin. The intermediates have remained as elus ive as ever and their absence remains, a century later, one of the most striki ng characteristics of the fossil record. 35 As a result, said Denton, the fossil record \"provide s a tremendous challenge to the notion of organic evolution.\" 36 But what about the archaeopteryx? The fossils of this magnificent creature, its detailed image pressed into fine-grained limest one, still seemed to sta nd in stark contrast to this trend. \"Doesn't archaeopteryx fill the gap between reptiles and modern birds?\" I asked Wells. \"There are several problems with that,\" came his reply. \"Does it show Darwinian evolution? Well, no, for the same reason that the Corvettes don't illustrate Darwinian evolution. We would need more than an intermediate form to show that; we would need to know how you get from one to the other. \"The question is, do you get from a reptile to a bird-which is an astonishingly huge step-by some totally natural process or does this require the intervention of a designer? An archaeopteryx, as beautiful as it is, doesn't show us one way or the othe r. Besides, we see strange animals around today, like the duck-billed platypus, which nobody considers transitional but which has characteristics of different classes.\" \"But the archaeopteryx is a half-bird, half -reptile, right?\" \"No, not even close,\" he insisted. \"It's a bird w ith modern feathers, and birds are very different from reptiles in many important ways-their breeding system, their bone structure, their lungs, their distribution of weight and muscles. It's a bi rd, that's clear-not part bird and part reptile. \"But there are more interesting parts to the archaeopteryx story,\" he added. \"The main one comes from a branch of e volutionary theory called cladistics. This takes Darwinian theory to the extreme. Cladists define homology, or physical similarities, as being due to common ancestry. Then they say, well, the main way we can gro up animals in the evolu tionary tree is through homologies, which is already a b it of a circular argument. When they go back into the fossil record, they assume birds came fr om reptiles by descent, and they look for reptiles that are more bird-like in their skeletal structure.\" \"Where do they find them?\" I asked. Wells smiled. \"That's the fascinating part,\" he sa id. \"It turns out they find them millions of years after archaeopteryx! So here we have archaeopteryx, which is undeniably a bird, and yet the fossils that look most like the reptilian ances tors of birds occur tens of millions of years later in the fossil record. The missing link is still missing! Now evolutionist s are stuck looking for another theoretical ancestor to try to fill the gaps, but it hasn't been found.\" \"So the archaeopteryx is not an ancestor of modern birds?\" \"Not at all. Paleontologists pretty much agree on that. There ar e too many structural differences. Larry Martin, a paleon tologist from the University of Kansas, said clearly in 1985 that the archaeopteryx is not an ancestor of any modern bird s; instead, it's a member of a totally extinct group of birds.\" 3 ' So much for the power of archaeopteryx to authenticate Darwin's claims. Even ardent evolutionist Pierre Lecomte du Nouy agrees:"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"We are not even authorized to c onsider the exceptional case of the archaeopteryx as a true link. By link, we mean a necessary stag e of transition between classes such as reptiles and birds, or between smaller groups. An animal displaying characters belonging to two different groups cannot be treated as a true link as long as the intermediary stages have not been found, and as long as the mechanisms of transition remain unknown.' ,, Yet even if archaeopteryx had turned out to be a transitional creature, it would have been but a whisper of protest to the fossil record's deafening roar against classical Darwinism. \"If we are testing Darwinism rather than me rely looking for a confirming example or two,\" Phillip Johnson said, \"then a single good candidate for ancestor status is not enough to save a theory that posits a worldwide history of continual evolutionary transformation.\"39 FRAUDS AND TURKEYS Paleontologists, however, have been on a frenzy to try to locate an actual reptilian ancestor for birds. Driven by an all-consuming commitment to evolutionary theory, their zeal has resulted in some recent embarrassments for science. Wells was more than willing to regale me with some examples. \"A few years ago the Nationa l Geographic Society announced that a fossil had been purchased at an Arizona mineral show that turned out to be `the missing link between terrestrial dinosaurs and birds that could actually fly,\"' he said. \"It certainl y looked that way. They called it the archaeoraptor, and it had the tail of a dinosau r and the forelimbs of a bird. National Geographic magazine published an article in 1999 that sa id there's now evidence that feathered dinosaurs were ancestors of the first bird.\" \"That sounds pretty convincing,\" I said. \"Well, the problem was that it was a fake!\" Wells said. \"A Chinese paleontologist proved that someone had glued a dinosaur tail to a primitive bird. He created it to resemble just what the scientists had been look ing for. There was a firestorm of criticism-the curator of birds at the Smithsonian charged that the Society had become aligned with `zealous scientists' who were `highly biased proselytizers of the faith' that birds evolved from dinosaurs.\" Then Wells made a blanket statement that struck me at the time as being too cynical. \"Fakes are coming out of these fossil beds all the time,\" he said, \"because the fossil dealers know there's big money in it. I remained skeptical about th at charge until I subsequently read an in terview with ornithologist Alan Feduccia, an evolutionary biologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. When a reporter for Discover magazine raised the archaeoraptor fraud, Feduccia said: Archaeoraptor is just the tip of the iceberg. There are sc ores of fake fossils out there, and they have cast a dark shadow over the whole field. When you go to these fossil shows, it's difficult to tell which ones are faked and which ones are not. I have heard there is a fake- fossil factory in northeast China, in Liaoni ng Province, near the deposits where many of these recent alleged feathe red dinosaurs were found. 40 Asked what would motivate such fraud, Fedducia replied: \"Money. The Chinese fossil trade has become a big business. These fossil forgeries have been sold on the black market for years now, for huge sums of money. Anyone who can produce a good fake stands to profit.\" 41 Other outlandish incidents occurred at about the same time the archaeoraptor fraud was"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"coming to light. Wells was attending a conference in Florida, where the star of the show was a fossil called bambiraptor, a chicken-sized dinosaur with supposedly bird-like characteristics. \"Again, paleontologists calle d it the missing link,\" Wells to ld me. \"And, sure enough, the reconstructed animal on display had feathers or feather-like structures on it. The problem was that no feathers were ever found with the fossil! But because sc ientists said they should be there, they were added. And the dinosaur looked even more like a bird because the guy who did the reconstruction used the same artificial eyes that taxidermists put in stuffed eagles.\" While there was a brief disclaimer, he added, it was rather cryptically written. \"Then a group of molecular biologists at the conference reported finding bird DNA in dinosaur bones that were sixty-five million years old. Now, that would be pretty exciting! They suggested that this was genetic evidence th at birds are closely related to dinosaurs. \"The problem is that the bones from which the DNA was supposedly extracted are from a branch of dinosaurs that had not hing to do with bird ancestry. Furthermore, the DNA they found was not ninety or ninety-nine percent similar to birds-it was one-hundred-percent turkey DNA! Even chickens don't have DNA that's one hundred percent similar to turkey DNA. Only turkeys have one-hundred-percent turkey DNA. \"So these people said they found turkey DNA in a dinosaur bone-and it actually got published in Science magazine! This is just incredible to me! The headline in the magazine said with a straight face: 'Dinos and Turkeys: Connected by DNA?\"' That last story begged the next question: \"How in the world do you explain how the turkey DNA got in there?\" Shaking his head, Wells said, \"Maybe somebo dy dropped a turkey sandwich in the dig or there was lab contamination. If I had reported someth ing like this in my grad student research, I would have been laughed out of the room. They would have told me, `G o do the test again-it's contaminated.' \"But for goodness sake, this was take n seriously enough to publish it in Science! Even the scientist who reported the finding admitted he was ` quite skeptical' of his own work at this point- and yet people were willing to seize on it to support their belief in Darwinian theory. \"42 THE LEGEND OF JAVA MAN I couldn't end my conversation without touchi ng on one more icon related to the fossil evidence: the pictures I've seen from time to time of a parade of ape- like creatures that morph into modern human beings. In fact, this illu stration is emblazoned across the cover of a 1998 edition of The Origin of Species. 43 For many, this \"ultimate icon\" is not just a theory, but an established fact. \"If you go back far enough,\" legendary newscaste r Walter Cronkite intoned in a documentary on evolution, \"we and the chimps share a common ancestor. My father's father's father's father, going back maybe a half-million generations-about five million years ago-was an ape.\" 44 That kind of certainty about human evolution was engendered in me as a youngster, when I would devour my World Book Encyclopedia. One of my favorite entries was \"Prehistoric Man,\" where I would linger for hours, fascinated by the part-ape, part -human nicknamed \"Java man.\" Apparently, I wasn't the only member of this missing link's fan club. Said the author of a book on paleoanthropology: Java man is like an old friend. We learned a bout him in grade school.... In fact, the vast majority of people who believe in human evol ution were probably first sold on it by this"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"convincing salesman. Not only is he the best-known human foss il, he is one of the only human fossils most people know. 45 World Book's two-page spread highlighted a parade of prehistoric men. Second in line was a lifelike bust of Java man from the American Museum of Natural History, accompanied by an outline showing his profile. With his sloping forehead, heavy brow, jutting jaw, receding chin and bemused expression, he was exactly what a blend of ape and man sh ould look like. For me, studying his face and looking into his eyes he lped cement the reality of human evolution. The encyclopedia confidently described how Dutch scientist Eugene Dubois, excavating on an Indonesian Island in 1891 and 1892, \"dug some bones from a riverbank.\" Java man, which he dated back half a million years, \"represents a st age in the development of modern man from a smaller-brained ancestor.\" 46 He was, according to Dubois, the missing link between apes and humans. 47 And I believed it all. I was blithely ignorant, howe ver, of the full Java man story. \"What is not so well known is that Java man consists of nothing more than a skullcap, a femur (thigh bone), three teeth, and a great deal of imagin ation,\" one author would later write. 48 In other words, the lifelike depiction of Java man, which had so gr ipped me when I was young, was little more than speculation fueled by evolutionary expectations of what he should have looked like if Darwinism were true. As a youngster beginning to form my opinions about human evolu tion, I wasn't aware of what I have more recently discovere d: that Dubois' shoddy excavatio n would have disqualified the fossil from consideration by today's standards. Or that the femur apparently didn't really belong with the skullcap. Or that the skull cap, according to prominent Cambridge University anatomist Sir Arthur Keith, was distinctly human and reflected a brain cap acity well within the range of humans living today. 49 Or that a 342-page scientific repo rt from a fact-finding expedition of nineteen evolutionists demolished Dubois' claims and concluded that Java man played no part in human evolution. 50 In short, Java man was not an ape-man as I ha d been led to believe, but he was \"a true member of the human family.\" 51 This was a fact apparently lost on Time magazine, which as recently as 1994 treated Java man as a legitimate evolutionary ancestor. 52 THE NARRATIVE OF HUMAN EVOLUTION Wells listened intently as I described to hi m how my exposure to misinformation about Java man had paved the way for my eventual whol ehearted embrace of Darwinian evolution. The factors that contributed to that debacle, he pointed out, are still quite relevant. \"One of the major problems with paleoanthropology is that compared to all the fossils we have, only a minuscule number are believed to be of creatures ancestral to humans,\" Wells said. \"Often, it's just skull fragments or teeth. \"So this gives a lot of elasticity in reconstruc ting the specimens to fit evolutionary theory. For example, when National Geographic hired four artists to reconstruct a female figure from seven fossil bones found in Kenya, they came up w ith quite different interpretations. One looked like a modern African-American woman; anothe r like a werewolf; another had a heavy, gorilla- like brow; and another had a missing forehead and ja ws that looked a bit like a beaked dinosaur. \"Of course, this lack of fossil evidence also makes it virtually impo ssible to reconstruct supposed relationships between ancestors and des cendents. One anthropologist likened the task to trying to reconstruct the plot of War and Peace by using just thirteen random pages from the book.\" 53"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Wells reached over again to pick up Icons of Evolution. \"I thought Henry Gee, the chief science writer for Nature, was quite candid in talking about this issue in 1999,\" Wells said as he searched for the right page. \"Gee wr ote, `The intervals of time that separate fossils are so huge that we cannot say anything definite about their possible connect ion through ancestry and descent.' \"He called each fossil `an isolat ed point, with no knowable connection to any other given fossil, and all float around in an overwhelming sea of gaps.' In fact, he said that all the fossil evidence for human evolution `between ten and five million years ago-several thousand generations of living creatures- can be fitted into a small box.' \"Consequently, he concluded that the conventional picture of huma n evolution is `a completely human invention created after the f act, shaped to accord with human prejudices.' Then he said quite bluntly: `To ta ke a line of fossils and claim that they represent a lineage is not a scientific hypothesis that can be tested, but an assertion that carries the same validity as a bedtime story-amusing, perhaps even instructive, but not scientific.\"' Wells put down the book. \"In other words, you're not going to reconstruct human evolutionary history just based on examining the few fossils we have,\" he continued. \"The only reason anyone thinks the eviden ce supports human evolution is because Darwinism is assumed to be true on other grounds. If it is, then it makes perfect sens e to extrapolate that to human history, which is what Darwin did in his book The Descent of Man. \"But what if the other evidence for Darwinism is faulty-which, in fact, it is? You and I didn't even go into the major flaws with a whole host of other evolution icons th at are used to teach students today. There's no shortage of books debunking Darwin. And without any compelling evidence for Darwinism in these areas, the whole question of human evolution is up for grabs. \"Instead, Darwinists assume the story of huma n life is an evolutionary one, and then they plug the fossils into a preexisting narrative where th ey seem to fit. The narrative can take several forms depending on one's biases. As one anthropologi st said, the process is `both political and subjective' to the point where he suggested that 'paleoanthr opology has the form but not the substance of a science.'\" \"In fact, a paleoanthropologist named Misia Landau wrote a book in which she talked about the similarities between the story of human e volution and old-fashioned folk tales. She concluded that many classic texts in the field we re `determined as much by traditional narrative frameworks as by material evidence' and that thes e themes `far exceed what can be inferred from the study of fossils alone.\"' I took a few moments to soak in what Wells had said. He was right-certainly Java man's fall from grace is instructive. It highlights how ma ny people, including myself, became adherents of Darwinism through fossils or other evidence that later discoveries have either undermined or disproved. But the damage has already been done in many cases-the student, unaware of these subsequent findings, has already grad uated into full-fledged naturalism. As I leaf back through my time-worn copies of the World Book from my childhood, I can now see how faulty science and Darwinian pres uppositions forced my former friend Java man into an evolutionary parade that's based much more on imagination than reality. Unfortunately, he's not the only example of that phenomenon, which is rife to the point of rendering the record of supposed human evoluti on totally untrustworthy. \"There is no encompassing theo ry of [human] evolution,\" con ceded Berkeley evolutionary biologist F. Clark Howell. \"Alas, there never really has been.\" 57 "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"OUTDATED, DISTORTED, FAKE, FAILURE At the end of our discussion abou t the fossil record, I reflected back on the four images that had paved the way for my descent into atheism. I could only shake my head. I was left with an origin-of-life experiment w hose results have been rendered meaningless; a Tree of Life that had been uprooted by the Biological Big Bang of the Cambrian explosion; doctored embryo drawings that don't reflect reality; and a fossil reco rd that stubbornly refuses to yield the transitional forms crucial to e volutionary theory. Doubts piled on doubts. Are these icons the sole evidence for Darwinism? Of course not. But their fate is illustrative of what happens time after time when macroevol ution is put under the microscope of scrutiny. As I continued to investigate the scientific and ph ilosophical underpinnings of evolutionary theory, in a long-standing probe that goes far beyond my encounter with Wells, I kept getting the same kind of results. No wonder a hundred scientists signed a public dissent from Darwinism. Yet every time an icon of evolution is discred ited, Darwinists claim with religious zeal that it was never really the whole story in the first place and insist that new findings really do buttress macroevolution. New narratives are created; new stories are told. The theory of evolution, now unsupported by the orig inal icon, is never questioned; instead, it's used afresh to justify a redesigned model. For instance, several years a go Gould and a colleague proposed a new hypothesis, called \"punctuated equilibrium,\" in a desperate bid to ex plain away the fossil gaps. They suggested that radically new species somehow managed to develop rapidly among isolated populations, conveniently leaving behind no fossils to document the process. When these new creatures rejoined the larger, central populations, this resu lted in the preserving of fossils that suggested the sudden appearance of new species. This model has been roundly critici zed, and rightly so, for creating far more questions than answers. 58 In the end, Darwinism ha s remained a philosophy still in search of convincing empirical data to back it up. Similarly, neo-Darwinists have proudly displa yed four-winged fruit f lies as evidence that small genetic changes can yield major physiological differences in organi sms. As Wells reveals in his book, however, these fruit flies must be caref ully bred from three artificially maintained mutant strains-an exceedingly unlikely circumst ance in nature. What's more, the males have difficulty mating, and because the extra wings are nonfunctional, these mutant flies are seriously handicapped. \"As evidence for evolution,\" he said, \"the four- winged fruit fly is no better than a tw o-headed calf in a circus sideshow.\" 59 Once again, closer investigation revealed that ev en the latest icons cannot buttress the sagging credibility of evolutionary theory. As for me, I fi nally came to the point where I realized that I just didn't have enough faith to maintain my belief in Darwinism. The evidence, in my estimation, was simply unable to support its grandest and most sweeping claims. THE CRY OF \"DESIGN!\" Before I packed my belongings and grabbed a cab for the airport, I wanted to ask Wells a few closing questions about the overall case for Darwinian evolution. \"Aft er years of studying this,\" I said, \"when you take the most current scientific evidence into consideration, what is your conclusion about Darwin's theory?\" Wells's answer began as soon as the words left my mouth. \"My c onclusion is that the case for Darwinian evolution is bankrupt,\" he said firmly. \"The evidence for Darwinism is not only grossly inadequate, it's systematically distorte d. I'm convinced that sometime in the not-too-"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"distant future-I don't know, maybe twenty or thir ty years from now-peopl e will look back in amazement and say, `How could anyone have believe d this?' Darwinism is merely materialistic philosophy masquerading as science, and pe ople are recognizing it for what it is. \"Now, having said that,\" he continued, \"I still see room for some evolutionary processes in limited instances. But saying evolution works in some cases is far from showing that it accounts for everything.\" I asked, \"If macroevolution has fail ed to prove itself to be a vi able theory, then where do you believe the evidence of science is pointing?\" There was no equivocation in Wells's voice. Speak ing with conviction, he said: \"I believe science is pointing strongly toward design. To me, as a scientist, the development of an embryo cries out, `Design!' The Cambrian explosion-the sudden appearance of complex life, with no evidence of ancestors-is more c onsistent with design than evolution. Homology, in my opinion, is more compatible with design. The origin of life certainly cries out for a designer. None of these things make as much sense from a Darw inian perspective as they do from a design perspective.\" \"Let me get this straight,\" I said. \"You're not merely saying th at the evidence for evolution is weak and therefore there must be an intellig ent designer. You're suggesting there is also affirmative evidence for a designer.\" \"I am,\" he relied. \"However, the two are conne cted, because one of the main functions of Darwinian theory is to try to make design unnecessary. This is what you experienced as you became an atheist. This is what I experienced. So showing that the arguments for evolution are weak certainly opens the door to design. \"And then,\" he said, \"when you analyze all of the most curren t affirmative evidence from cosmology, physics, astronomy, biology, and so fo rth-well, I think you'll discover that the positive case for an intelligent design er becomes absolutely compelling.\" I stood and shook Wells' hand. \"That,\" I sa id, \"is what I'm going to find out.\" SCIENCE VERSUS FAITH The plane ride through the blac k velvet sky over the Pacific Coasi was exceptionally smooth that evening, and I closed my eyes as 1 reclined my seat as far as it would go. I felt satisfied by my interview with Wells and was anxious to de termine whether the most un-to-date scientific evidence supports the existen ce of the intelligent designer he had talked about. Still, though, some pesky questions continued to bother me. I remained troubled by the inters ection of science and faith. I n eeded to resolve whether these two domains are destined to be at war with each other, as some people claim. Can a scientific person legitimately entertain the idea of the supe rnatural? How much can empirical data tell us about the divine? Should scientists merely stick to their test tubes and let the theologians ponder God? Should pastors be allowed to poke their nose into the research labo ratory? Can science and faith ever really be partners in pursuit of the ultimate answers of life? I knew I needed to get some answers to those qu estions before I could go any further. I pulled the blanket up to my neck and decided to get some sleep. Tomorrow, I' d be planning another journey.

One of the great achievements of sc ience has been, if not to make it impossible for an intelligent person to be re ligious, then at least to make it possible for them not to be religious. We should not retrea t from this accomplishment. Physicist Steven Weinberg,' Science and religion ... are fr iends, not foes, in the comm on quest for knowledge. Some people may find this surprising, for there's a feeling throughout our society that religious belief is outmoded, or downright impossible, in a scientific age . I don't agree. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that if people in this so called \"scientific age\" knew a bit more about science than many of them actually d o, they'd find it easier to share my view. Physicist and theolo gian John Polkinghorne 2 Allan Rex Sandage, the greatest observational cosmologist in the world-who has deciphered the secrets of the stars, plumbed the mysteries of quasars, revealed the age of globular clusters, pinpointed the distances of remote galaxies, and quantified the universe' s expansion through his work at the Mount Wilson and Palomar observatori es prepared to step onto the platform at a conference in Dallas. Few scientists are as widely respected as this one-time protege to legendary astronomer Edwin Hubble. Sandage has been showered with prestigious honors from the American Astronomical Society, the Swis s Physical Society, the Royal Astronomical Society, and the Swedish Academy of Sciences, receiving astron omy's equivalent of the Nobel Prize. The New York Times dubbed him the \"Grand Old Man of Cosmology.\" As he approached the stage at this 1985 conference on science and religion, there seemed to be little doubt where he would s it. The discussion would be about the origin of the universe, and the panel would be divided among those scientists who believed in God and those who didn't, with each viewpoint having its own side of the stage. Many of the attendees probably knew that the et hnically Jewish Sandage had been a virtual atheist even as a child. Many ot hers undoubtedly believed that a scientist of his stature must surely be skeptical about God. As Newsweek put it, \"The more deeply scientists see into the secrets of the universe, you'd expect, the more God would fade away from their hearts and minds.\" 3 So Sandage's seat among the doubters was a given. Then the unexpected happened. Sandage set the room abuzz by turning and taking a chair among the theists. Even more dazzling, in the context of a talk about the Big Bang and its philosophical implications, he disclosed publicly that he had decided to become a Christian at"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"age fifty. The Big Bang, he told the rapt audience, was a supernatural event that cannot be explained within the realm of physics as we know it. Scie nce had taken us to the First Event, but it can't take us further to the First Cause. The sudden emergence of matter, space, time, and energy pointed to the need for so me kind of transcendence. \"It was my science that drove me to the conclu sion that the world is much more complicated than can be explained by science,\" he would later tell a reporter. \"It was only through the supernatural that I can understand the mystery of existence.\" 4 Sitting among the Dallas crowd that day, ast ounded by what he was hearing from Sandage, was a young geophysicist who had dropped by the conference almost by accident. Stephen Meyer had become a Christian through a philosophical quest for the meani ng of life, but he hadn't really explored the issue of whether scien ce could provide evidential support for his faith. Now here was not only Sandage but also prom inent Harvard astrophysicist Owen Gingerich concluding that the Big Bang seemed to fit best into a theistic worldview. Later came a session on the origin of life, featuring Dean Kenyon, a bi ophysicist from San Francisco State University, who had co-authored an influential book asserting that the emergence of life might have been \"biochemically predestined,\" because of an in herent attraction between amino acids.' This seemed to be the most promising explanation fo r the conundrum of how th e first living cell could somehow self-assemble from nonliving matter. To Meyer's surprise, Kenyon stepped to the podium and actually r epudiated the conclusions of his own book, declaring that he had come to the poi nt where he was critical of all naturalistic theories of origins. Due to the immense molecular complexity of the cell and the i n formation- bearing properties of DNA, Ke nyon now believed that the best evidence pointed toward a designer of life. Instead of science and religion be ing at odds, Meyer heard specialis ts at the highest levels of achievement who said they were theistsnot in sp ite of the scientific ev idence but because of it. As Sandage would say, \"Many scientists are now driven to faith by their very work.\" 6 Meyer was intrigued. It seemed to him that the th eists had the intellectual initiative in each of the three issues discussed at the conference-the orig in of the universe, the origin of life, and the nature of human consciousness. Even skeptics on the panels conceded the shortcomings of naturalistic explanations . Their main response was only to challenge the theists to provide \"scientific answers\" inst ead of merely invoking the idea of intelligent design. That objection didn't make much sense to Meyer. \"Maybe the world looks designed,\" he mused, \"because it really is designed!\" As he walked away from the conference, Meye r was brimming with excitement over what he had experienced. Despite his background in science, he simply had been unaware of the powerful scientific findings that were supporting belief in God. All of this, he de cided, was worth a much more thorough investigation. He didn't know it at the time, but his life's mission had just crystallized. INTERVIEW #2: STEPHEN C. MEYER, PHD Already having earned degrees in physics and ge ology, Meyer went on to receive his master's degree in the history and philosophy of science at prestigious Cambridge University in England, where he focused on the history of molecular bi ology, the history of physic s, and evolutionary theory. He then obtained his doctorate from Cambridge, where his dissertation analyzed the scientific and methodological issues in origin-of-life biology-a fi eld he first got excited about"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"when he heard Kenyon speak at the Dallas conference. In the past fifteen years, Meyer has become one of the most knowledgeable and compelling voices in the burgeoning Intelligent Design movement. He has contributed to numerous books- including Darwinism, Design and Public Education; Mere Creation: Science, Faith and Intelligent Design; Signs of Intelligence: U nderstanding Intelligent Design; Science and Christianity: Four Views; The Creation Hypothesis: Scientific Evidence for an Intelligent Creator; Science and Evidence for Design in the Universe; The History of Science and Religion in the Western Tradition; Of Pandas and People: The Central Question of Biological Origins; Darwinism: Science or Philosophy; and Facets of Faith and Science, and is currently finishing books on DNA and the Cambrian explosion. He has spoken at symposia at Cambridge, Oxfor d, Yale, Baylor, the University of Texas, and elsewhere; debated skeptics, incl uding Michael Shermer, editor of The Skeptical Inquirer; written for magazines ranging from Origins and Design (where he's an associate editor) to The Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies to National Review; appeared in the Wall Street Journal, Washington Times, Chicago Tribune, and a host of other newspapers; and faced off with Darwinists on National Public Radio, PBS, and network television. When I flew into snowy Spokane, Washington, to interview Meyer at Whitworth College, where he was an associate professor of philosophy, I wasn't aware that he was in the midst of telling his colleagues that he w ould be leaving soon to become di rector and senior fellow at the Center for Science and Culture at the Discovery Institute in Seattle. Hi s impending departure was a poignant time for Meyer, since he had spent more than a decade as one of the most popular professors at the school. To steal some time alone, we commandeered a nondescript off campus office, where decorating was an apparent afterthought, and sat down in facing chairs for what would turn out to be virtually an entire day of animated, rapid-fire conversati on. In fact, the full transcript of our discussion would top a whopping thirty thousand words-a small book in itself! At one point, Meyer said, \"I was once tested for hyperactivity as a kid. Can you imagine?\" Yes, I could. Dressed in a dark blue suit, patter ned tie, woolly gray sock s, and brown Doc Martin shoes, the lanky Meyer was crackl ing with energy, speaking enthus iastically in quick bursts of words. His wispy brown hair spilled down onto his forehead, giving him a youthful appearance, but his eyebrows were furrowed in intensity. His students sometimes faulted him for an ab sentminded professor's lack of classroom organization, but he made up for it with his inf ectious passion and disarming sincerity. When he answered my q uestions, it was in a thorough, systematic, and structured way, almost as if he were reading off invisible note cards. He came off as being brilliant, articulate, and driven. After swapping some personal stories, we zeroed in on the issue of science and faith. His perspective, not surprisingly, wa s vastly different from the one I had when I began studying Darwinism in school. \"A ROBUST CASE FOR THEISM\" \"We live in a technological culture where many people believe science trumps all other forms of knowledge,\" I said to Meyer. \"For example, philosopher J. P. Moreland described meeting an engineer who was completing his doctorate in physics. `According to him,' Moreland said, `only science is rational; only science achieves truth. Everything el se is mere belief and opinion. He went on to say that if something cannot be qua ntified or tested by th e scientific method ... it"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"cannot be true or rational.'' Harv ard geneticist Richard Lewontin claimed science is `the only begetter of truth.'$ Do you ag ree with those perspectives?\" \"No, I don't,\" came Meyer's reply. \"Ironically, to say that science is the only begetter of truth is self-contradicting, because that statement in its elf cannot be tested by the scientific method. It's a selfdefeating philosophical assumption. \"Beyond that,\" he continued, \"while I certainly respect science, I don't believe scientific knowledge necessarily takes preced ence over other things that we know. For instance, Moreland has argued that there are some things we know more certainly through introspection than we know from the sciences. I know I have free will on the basis of my intr ospection, and no studies in the social sciences will convince me otherwise.\" He motioned toward a light switch on the wall. \"I know I can turn that switch on, and I refute those who say I was determined thus,\" he said, leaning over to turn on the light. \"In addition, history can tell us much, even though we can't test it by repeated experiment. \"Now, there's no question that sc ience does teach us many importa nt things about the natural world. But the real question is, `Do these things point to anything beyo nd themselves?' I think the answer is yes. Science teaches us many true things, and some of those true things point toward God.\" I quickly interrupted. \"On the contrary,\" I said, \"when I learned about Darwinism as a student, I was convinced that scie nce and faith were at odds-and th at science definitely had the edge in the credibility department. What woul d you say to someone who believes that science and Christianity are destined to be at war?\" \"Well, that's certainly one way that people have conceptualized the relationship between science and faith,\" he said. \"Some claim science and faith are fundamentally at odds. Others have said science and faith represent two separate and di stinct realms that don't and can't interact with each other. \"However, I personally take a third approach, which is that scientific evidence actually supports theistic belief. In fact, across a wide range of the sciences, evidence has come to light in the last fifty years which, taken together, provides a robust case for theism. Only theism can provide an intellectually satis fying causal explanation fo r all of this evidence.\" \"For instance?\" \"For instance,\" he continued, \"if it's true there's a beginning to the universe, as modern cosmologists now agree, then this implies a cause that transcends the universe. If the laws of physics are fine-tuned to permit life, as contem porary physicists are discovering, then perhaps there's a designer who fine-tuned them. If there' s information in the cell, as molecular biology shows, then this suggests inte lligent design. To get life going in the first place would have required biological information; the implications point beyond the materi al realm to a prior intelligent cause. \"Those are just three examples,\" he conc luded. \"And that's just the beginning.\" THE PROBLEM WITH NOMA \"Isn't it dangerous to mix science and faith that way?\" I asked. \"A lot of scientists follow the lead of the late Stephen Jay G ould in saying that science and faith occupy distinctly different 'magisteria' or domains. \"He called this philosophy NOMA, which is sh ort for 'nonoverlapping magisteria.' He said: `The net of science covers th e empirical universe ... [while] th e net of religi on extends over questions of"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"moral meaning and value.' 9 What's wrong with having that ki nd of strong dividing line between the hard facts of science and the soft faith of religion?\" \"I think NOMA is partially true,\" Meyer said-a c oncession that surprised me a bit. \"There are domains of science that are metaphysically neut ral. They answer questions like: `How many elements are in the periodic table?' Or `What is the mathematical equation that describes gravitational attraction?' Or `How does nature ordinarily behave under a given set of conditions?' Questions of this sort don't affect big worldview issues one way or the other. Some people use Galileo's old aphorism-'Science tells you how the heavens go, and the Bible tells you how to go to heaven.\"' I jumped in. \"That sounds trite, but it does make some sense.\" \"Of course,\" he said. \"There is a sense in which science and religion do have different objects of interest and focus, like the nature of the Trinity on one hand, and what are the elementary particles present at the Big Bang on the other hand. \"However, there are other scientif ic questions that bear directly on the great worldview issues. For instance, the question of origins. If fully natu ralistic models are correct, then theism becomes an unnecessary hypothesis. It's in these instance s where science and metaphysics intersect-where worldview questions are at stak e-that it's impossibl e to impose the NOMA principle. That's because what science discovers will inevitably have implications for these larger worldview questions. The only real way to keep the two separate is to subtract from the claims of one or the other. \"You see, NOMA says science is the realm of fa cts, and religion is the realm of morality and faith. The essential problem is that biblical religion makes very sp ecific claims about facts. It makes claims about the universe having a beginning, about God play ing a role in creation, about humans having a certain kind of nature, and about historical events that are purported to have happened in time and space. \"Let's just take the historic Christian creed: `I believe in God the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth: And in Jesus Christ his only son, our Lord; who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under P ontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried; the third day he rose again from the dead.' \"Well, Pontius Pilate is situated historically in Palestine in the first century. A claim is made that Jesus of Nazareth lived at the same time. An assertion is made that he rose from the dead. God is called the Creator of heav en and earth. You see, it's inherent to the Christian faith to make claims about the real world. According to the Bibl e, God has revealed himself in time and space, and so Christianity-fo r good or ill-is going to intersect some of the factual claims of history and science. There's either going to be conflict or agreement. \"To make NOMA work, its advo cates have to water down science or faith, or both. Certainly Gould did-he said religion is just a matter of ethical teaching, comfort, or metaphysical beliefs about meaning. But Christianity certainly claims to be more than that.\" This particular statement about Gould seemed vague. I wanted to pin him down by demanding specifics. \"Could you give me one concrete example of how Gould watered down Christianity to make NOMA work?\" I asked. \"Sure,\" he said. \"In his book Rocks of Ages, Gould reduces the appearance of the resurrected Jesus to doubting Thomas to being merely `a moral tale.' 1 O This was necessary for Gould to do under the rules of NOMA because all of Jesus' post-resurrection appearances come from a religious document-the Bible-and NOMA says re ligion must confine its claims to matters of morality and values. But the Bible clearly portrays Jesus' appearances as being actual historical"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"events. Christianity hinges on the co nviction that they really occurred. \"NOMA may try to exclude this possibility by restricting religion to mere matters of morality, but the writers of the Bible did not s ee fit to limit their cl aims about God to the nonfactual domain that NOMA has a llocated to religion. Now, there might be some religions that can fit comfortably with NOMA. But biblical Christ ianity-because it's built not just on faith, but on facts-simply cannot.\" Law professor Phillip Johnson also has been strongly critical of the NOMA concept. \"Stephen Jay Gould condescendingly offers to a llow religious people to express their subjective opinions about morals, provided they don't interfere with the authority of sc ientists to determine the 'facts'-one of the facts being that God is merely a comforting myth,\" he said.\" \"So,\" I said to Meyer in su mming up, \"while much of scie nce and biblical religion are concerned with different things, they clea rly do have some overlapping territory.\" \"Precisely. And when that happens, either they agree or disagree. The judgment of nineteenth-century historians, who were writing mainly out of an Enlightenment framework, was that where they did overlap, they invariably disagreed-and of the two domains, science was a more warranted system of belief. They believed conflict would c ontinually grow between science and biblical religion.\" \"What do you believe?\" I asked. \"My judgment is quite different,\" he said. \"I believe that the testimony of science supports theism. While there will always be points of tension or unresolved conflict, the major developments in science in the past five decades have been r unning in a strongly theistic direction.\" He paused momentarily, then punc hed his conclusion: \"Science, done right, points toward God.\" CREATIO EX NIHILO Meyer's perspective couldn't be more differe nt from the one I had when I was studying evolution in school. I had concluded that the persuasive naturalistic theories of Darwin eliminated any need for God. Meyer, however, was convinced that science and faith are pointing toward the same truth. I decided to press him for more details. \"Could you list, say, half a dozen examples of how you believe science points toward theism?\" I asked. Meyer settled deeper into his ch air. \"I would start,\" he sai d, \"with the new cosmology-the Big Bang theory and its accompanying theoretical underpinning in general relativity. These two theories now point to a definite beginning of the universe. The f act that most scientists now believe that energy, matter, space, and time ha d a beginning is profoundly antimaterialistic. \"You can invoke neither time nor space nor matte r nor energy nor the laws of nature to explain the origin of the universe. General relativity points to the need for a cause that transcends those domains. And theism affirms the existence of such an entity-namely, God. \"In short,\" he added, \"naturalism is on hard tim es in cosmology; the deeper you get into it, the harder it is to get rid of the God hypothe sis. Taken together, th e Big Bang and general relativity provide a scientific description of what Christians call creatio ex nihilo-creation out of nothing. As Nobel Prize-winner Arno Penzias said about the Bi g Bang, `The best data we have are exactly what I would have predicted had I noth ing to go on but the first five books of Moses, the Psalms and the Bible as a whole.\"\"' Meyer waited, apparently to see if I had any further questions, but I motioned for him to"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"continue with his examples. \"The second category of evid ence would be for 'anthropic finetuning.' This means the fundamental laws and parameters of physics have precise numerical values that could have been otherwise. That is, there's no funda mental reason why these values have to be the way they are. Yet all of these laws and constants conspire in a mathematically incredible way to make life in the universe possible.\" I asked him for an example. \"Take the expansion rate of the universe, which is fine-tuned to one part in a trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion,\" he said. \"T hat is, if it were changed by one part in either direction-a little faster, a little slower-we could not have a universe that would be capable of supporting life. \"As Sir Fred Hoyle commented, `A commonsense interpretation of the facts suggests that a superintellect has monkeyed with physics, as well as chemistry and biology, and that there are no blind forces worth speak ing about in nature.' 13 \"Well, maybe this looks fine-tuned because there actually is a fine-tuner. In the opinion of physicist Paul Davies, `The impression of design is overwhelming.' 14 And I thoroughly agree. This is powerful evidence for intelligent design. \"The third example of science pointing toward God is the origin of life and the origin of information necessary to bring life into existence,\" he continued. \"Life at its root requires information, which is stored in DNA and protein molecules. \"Richard Dawkins of Oxford said that `the machine code of th e genes is uncannily computer-like.' 15 If you reflect on that, you realize that co mputers run on software programs that are produced by intelligent engin eers. Every experience we have about informationwhether it's a computer code, hieroglyphic inscription, a book, or a cave painting-points toward intelligence. The same is true about the information inside every cell in every living creature.\" \"Isn't that just an argument from ignorance?\" I asked. \"Scientists may not currently be able to find any explanation for how life be gan, but that doesn't necessarily point toward a supernatural conclusion.\" \"This is not an argument from ignorance,\" Meyer insisted. \"We're not inferring design just because the naturalistic evolutiona ry theories all fail to explain information. We infer design because all those theories fail and we know of another causal entity that is capable of producing information-namely, intelligence. Personally, I find this to be a very strong argument indeed.\" AN ENSEMBLE OF EVIDENCE Continuing on to the fourth example, Meyer sa id, \"Then there's the evidence for design in molecular machines that defy explanation by Da rwinian natural selecti on. These integrative, complex systems in biological organisms-which microbiologist Michael Behe calls 'irreducibly complex'-include signal transduction circuits, s ophisticated motors, and all kinds of biological circuitry.\" \"What's the argument based on this?\" I asked. \"You see, these biological machines need all of their various parts in order to function. But how could you ever build such a system by a Darw inian process of natural selection acting on random variations? Natural selection only preserves things that perform a function-in other words, which help the organism survive to the next generation. That's survival of the fittest. \"The problem with irreducibly complex systems is that they perform no function until all the parts are present and working to gether in close coordination w ith one another. So natural selection cannot help you build su ch systems; it can only preserve them once they've been built."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"And it's virtually impossible for ev olution to take such a huge leap by mere chance to create the whole system at once. \"Of course, this forces the question: how di d the biochemical machine arise? Behe says maybe these biological systems look designed because they really were designed. After all, whenever we see irreducibly complex systems and we know how they arose, invariably a designer was the cause.\" \"How strong of an argument do you think that is?\" I asked. \"I think it's very strong,\" he re plied with a smile. \"And you see that in the w eak objections that are proposed by Darwinists. And again, that's just one more example. The next one would be the Cambrian explosion, which is yet another st riking piece of evidence for design in the history of life.\" I told him that in a previous interview Jonathan Wells had already explained the basics of Biology's Big Bang. \"He talked about it primarily in terms of being an argument against Darwinism,\" I said. \"Indeed, it is,\" Meyer replied. \"You have between twenty and thirty-five completely novel body plans that come online in the Cambrian. You have a huge jump in complexity, it's sudden, and you have no transitional intermediates. \"But this is also affirmative evidence for design, because in our experience information invariably is the result of c onscious activity. Here we have th e geologically sudden infusion of a massive amount of new biological informati on needed to create these body plans, far beyond what any Darwinian mechanism can produce. Darw inism simply can't account for it; design is a better explanation. \"Think about how suddenly these new body pl ans emerged. As one paleontologist said, `What I want to know from my biology friends is just how fast does th is evolution have to happen before they stop calling it evolution?' Darwin said natu re takes no sudden leaps. Yet here's a huge leap-which is what intelligent ag ents cause. Consequently, the Cambrian explosion provides not just a negative case against Darwinian evolution, but also a compelling positive argument for design.\" \"All right,\" I said, \"I asked for half a do zen examples. What would be the sixth?\" Meyer thought for a moment. \"I'd say human consciousness certainly supports a theistic view of human nature,\" he said. \"Judaism and Chri stianity clearly teach th at we are more than just matterwe're not a `computer made of meat,' in the words of Marvin Minsky, but we're made in God's image. \"We have the capacity for self-reflection, fo r representational art, for language, for creativity. Science can't account for this kind of consciousness merely from the interaction of physical matter in the brain. Where did it come from? Again, I think theism provides the best explanation.\" Meyer scooted to the edge of hi s chair. \"So what we have he re,\" he said, wrapping up his impromptu presentation in a tone of urgency, \"is an ensemble of half a dozen evidences that point to a transcendent, intelligen t cause. This is mind-boggling stuff! Scientists in the nineteenth century weren't aware of these things when they said naturalism accounts for everything. Thanks to the discoveries of the last five decades, we know a lot more today.\" \"Based on the evidence you've mentioned,\" I sa id, \"how do you complete the case for God?\" \"First, theism, with its concept of a transcende nt Creator, provides a more causally adequate explanation of the Big Bang than a naturalistic explanation can offe r,\" he said. \"The cause of the universe must transcend matter, space, and time, which were brought into existence with the Big"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Bang. The Judeo-Christian God has precisely this attribute of tran scendence. Yet naturalism, by definition, denies the existence of any enti ty beyond the closed system of nature. \"The fine-tuning of the physical laws and constants of the universe and the precise configuration of its initial conditions, dating back to the very origin of the universe itself, suggest the need for a cause that's intelligent. Theism af firms the existence of an entity that's not only transcendent but intelligent as well-namely, God. Thus, theism can explain both Big Bang cosmology and the anthropic fine-tuning. \"Pantheism can't explain the origin of the universe, because pantheists believe in an impersonal god that's coextensive with the ph ysical universe. Such a god can't bring the universe into being from nothing, since such a god doesn't exist independently of the physical universe. If initially the physical universe didn't exist, then th e pantheistic god wouldn't have existed either. If it didn't exist, it couldn't cause the universe to exist.\" \"What about deism?\" I interjecte d, referring to the belief that God created the world but has since let it run on its own. \"Can't deism acc ount for the origin of the universe too?\" \"Yes, I'll provide that caveat-d eism can do the same,\" he acknowledged. \"But I believe the existence of design subsequent to the Big Bang undermines deism as an adequate explanation. \"You see, deism can't explain the evidence of di screte acts of design or creation after the universe was created. The deistic god never interv enes in nature, yet we're seeing evidence of intelligent design in the history of life. For ex ample, the high information content in the cell provides compelling evidence for an act of intell igent design of the first life, long after the beginning of the universe. \"Taken together, what we know today gives us heightened confidence-from science-that God exists. The weight of the evidence is very, very impressive-in fact, in my opinion it's sufficiently conclusive to say that theism provides the best explanation for the ensemble of scientific evidence we've been discussing. \"Science and faith are not at war. When scient ific evidence and biblical teaching are correctly interpreted, they can and do suppor t each other. I'd say to a nyone who doubts that: investigate the evidence yourself.\" Meyer's whirlwind tour was exhilarating. At first blush, the cumulative case for God, built point by point from the discoveri es of science, seemed staggeri ng. Of course, I had a whole slew of follow-up questions, some of which I intended to pose to Meyer, and others I would save for the experts I planned to interv iew in each of the categories of evidence Meyer had mentioned. I decided to begin with the issue of just how much evidence for God is needed to establish the case for a Creator. THE GOD HYPOTHESIS In the legal arena, different courtrooms have different standards of proof. In criminal cases, the prosecutor must prove the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In most civil cases, the plaintiff must prevail by a considerably lesser standard, called a preponderance of the evidence. In some civil cases, there's even a thir d level of proof situated between the other two: clear and convincing evidence. 16 When I asked Meyer what standard of proof he considered appropriate in the theological realm, he gave me an interesting history lesson on the topic of evidence for God. I decided to sit back and let him talk, reserving my follow-up questions for the end. \"One extreme is to deny that there is any evid ential basis for Christian belief and instead to say that all we need is faith,\" Meyer began. \"That's known as 'fideism.' This came out of the"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Enlightenment, with the perceive d failure of certain theistic proofs for the existence of God. \"In particular, French philosopher Rene Descartes offered some pretty sloppy proofs to try to establish with absolute certainty that God exis ts. He used what are called `deductive proofs,' where you have major and minor premises, and if th ese premises can be shown to be true and the logic of the argument is correct, then the conclu sion follows with certainty. For example, `All men are mortal, Socrates is a man, therefore Socrat es is mortal.' Descartes set the bar unrealisti- cally high-that is, using his proofs to try to create ironclad certainty that God exists-and he couldn't clear it. You can't absolutely prove-or disprove-the existence of God. \"As a result, the opinion developed that argum ents for God's existence don't work and that therefore there's no rational basis for faith. Then Darwin, by showing that the appearance of design could be explained through natural mechanis ms without an actual de signer, contributed to the conviction that there was no rational or evidential basis fo r believing in God. \"In light of that, religious believers had a choice: reject faith, because it has no rational foundation, or reject the idea that you need a rational foundation for faith. The ones who remained believers took the latter, by saying, `I believe, I just don't have or need a rational basis for doing so.' They would then adopt strategies that would compartmentalize faith and reason, which led to the conclusion that faith and science occupy two different realms. \"But there's a third option, whic h involves making a persuasive case for faith without using deductive proofs. Mathematician William Dembski and I wrote an article in 1998, articulating a model of reasoning that we think can be used to support theistic belief. It's called `inference to the best explanation.' \"This is a form of practical reasoning that we use in life all the time. It says if we want to explain a phenomenon or event, we consider a whole range of hypotheses and infer to the one which, if true, would provide the best explanation. In other words, we do an exhaustive analysis of the possible explanations and keep adding info rmation until only one explanation is left that can explain the whole range of data. \"The way you discriminate betw een the competing hypotheses is to look at their explanatory power. Often, more than one hypothesis can explain the same piece of evidence. For instance, as we just agreed, deism and theism can both explai n the beginning of the universe. Okay, fine. But if you keep looking at the data, you find that only theism can explain the evidence for design in biology after the origin of the universe. And so theism ha s superior explanatory power. \"We reach conclusions with a high degree of conf idence using this form of reasoning in our everyday life. This is what detectives do. This is what lawyers do in courts of law. Scientists use this approach. This model can enable us to achieve a high degree of practical certainty. \"And when we look at the evidence I've me ntioned from cosmology, physics, biology, and human consciousness, we find that theism has amazing explanatory scope and power. The existence of God explains th is broad range of evidence more simply, adequately, and comprehensively than any other worldview, incl uding its main competitors, naturalism or pantheism. And the discovery of corroborati ng or supportive evidence is accelerating. \"In 1992, the historian of science Frederic Bu rnham said the God hypothesis `is now a more respectable hypothesis than at any time in the last one hundred years.'\" I'd go even further. More than just being `respectable,' I'd say that th e God hypothesis is forceful enough to warrant a verdict that he's alive and well.\" THE MOTIVES OF SCIENTISTS Several questions popped into my mind as I li stened to Meyer's analysis. \"I gave you the"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"opportunity to offer six strands of scientific evidence for theism, and I'll be following up with specific objections when I explore them in-depth with other expert s,\" I said. \"But I don't want to leave without posing at least f our overall challenges to you.\" As he listened, Meyer removed his gold-rimmed glasses and started cleaning them with a handkerchief. He looked up at me and said, \"T hat sounds fair. Go ahead. What's your first question?\" I glanced down at my notes before speaking. \"I f the scientific evidence for theism is so compelling,\" I began, \"then why don't more scien tists believe in God? A study in 1966 showed that sixty percent of scientists either disbelieve or were doubt ful about God, and the percentage goes up if you look at the most elite scientists.\" 18 Meyer pursed his lips as he reflected on the que stion. \"Initially, I'd say th at it takes time for new discoveries to percolate and for their implica tions to be fully considered, and some of the best evidence for theism is very new,\" he said. \"Scientists who are focused on one particular field may not be aware of discoveries in other fields that point toward theism. \"Also, the materialistic worldview has exercise d dominance on intellectual life in western culture for a hundred and fifty years. It has become the default worldview in science, philosophy, and academia in general. It's presupposed. So me people who dissent from it have experienced intense hostility and sometimes persecution. That could discourage others from exploring this area or speaking out favorably toward it.\" This point reminded me of a quote by Sandage, w ho once told a reporter that the scientific community is so scornful of faith that \"there is a reluctance to reveal yourself as a believer, the opprobrium is so severe.\" 19 \"Finally,\" continued Meyer, \"w ithin the scientific culture there are belief systems that are philosophically very questionable. For instan ce, many believe that science must only allow naturalistic e xplanations, which excludes from cons ideration the design hypothesis. Many scientists put blinders on, re fusing to acknowledge that evidence, and a kind of `group think' develops.\" His answer sounded plausible, but it prompted a second line of inquiry. \"There's a flip side to that issue,\" I said. \"Skeptic Michael Shermer said almost all the people he sees in the Intelligent Design movement are Christians. 20 Doesn't that undermine the legitimacy of their science? Maybe they're only looking for what they want to find and aren't open to naturalistic explanations that might be sufficient.\" This challenge seemed to push a button with Me yer. \"Every scientist has a motive,\" he said firmly, \"but motives are irrelevant to assessing the validity of scientific theories, a case in court, or an argument in philosophy. Yo u have to respond to the eviden ce or argument that's being offered, regardless of who offers it or why. If every person in the Intelligent Design movement were a fundamentalist who attends Baptist Bible Church, it wouldn't matter. Their arguments have to be weighed on their own merits.\" \"But is this an exclusively Christian movement?\" I asked. \"No, it's not,\" he replied. \"There are scientis ts who are proponents of intelligent design who are agnostic or Jewish, but I still don't think that 's relevant. The vast majority of people who advocate Darwinism are na turalists or materialis ts, so you could play the motivemongering game either way. \"Besides, look at it this way: if a scientist be comes persuaded by the evid ence that theism is true and thus becomes a follower of God, should he or she then be disqualified from doing science in that area? Of course not. I say let's get beyond this side issue and let the evidence"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"speak for itself. Is design th e best explanation or not?\" \"That leads to the third question,\" I said. \"I f scientists do allow the possibility of the miraculous as an explanation, then doesn't that foreclose further investigation? Biologist Kenneth Miller has suggested that inferring the existence of an intelligent designer would result in a scientific dead-end.\" Why continue to explore an area scientifically once you've thrown up your hands and said, `God did this'?\" Meyer immediately fired back. \"I think the shoe is exactly on the other foot,\" he said. \"How so?\" \"Let's take the issue of origins, for example,\" he said. \"The question that's asked is, `How did the cell arise on earth?' If you say, `We're only going to let you consider answers that involve materialistic processes,' then that shuts dow n inquiry, because one of the possible causal explanations for the origin of life is that intelligence could have played a role.\" \"So,\" I said, \"you believe that ruling out the possi bility of intelligent desi gn stifles intellectual and scientific inquiry.\" \"That's exactly right,\" he replied. \"And I've seen it happen far too often.\" I pointed at him. \"You want to change the ru les of the game, don't you?\" I said, my tone suggesting I had just caught him w ith his hand in the cookie jar. \"In a sense, yes,\" he conceded. \"I don't think it's right to invoke a self-ser ving rule that says only naturalistic explanations can be considered by science. Let's have a new period in the history of science where we have methodological rules that actuall y foster the unfettered seeking of truth. Scientists should be allowed to follow the evidence wherever it lead s-even if it leads to a conclusion that makes some people uncomfortable.\" SEEING EYE TO EYE My fourth objection concerned a topic called \"d isteleology,\" which refers to apparent poor design in the biological and physical world. \"To adopt the explanat ion of design, we are forced to attribute a host of flaws and imperfections to the Designer,\" Miller wrote . 22 The implication is that an imperfect design disprove s the existence of a perfect God. One example Miller cited is the vertebrate eye. \"We would have to wonder w hy an intelligent designer placed the neural wiring of the retina on the side facing the inco ming light,\" he wrote. \"This arrangement scatters the light, making our vision less detailed than it might be, and even produces a blind spot at the poin t that the wiring is pulled thr ough the light-sensitive retina to produce the optic nerve that carries visual images to the brain.\" 2 3 Other Darwinists, including Oxford's Richard Dawkins, also have decried the eye's poor structure, with George Williams going so far as to declare it \"stupidly\" designed because \"the retina is upside down.\" 24 This seemed to be a compelling counter-argument to intelligent design. \"If there is a designer,\" I said to Meyer, \"doesn't the botched e ye design prove he's not really intelligent?\" He pounced on the issue. \"There's an important physiological reason as to why the retina has to be inverted in the eye,\" he said. \"Within th e overall design of the system, it's a tradeoff that allows the eye to process the va st amount of oxygen it needs in ve rtebrates. Yes, this creates a slight blind spot, but that's not a problem becau se people have two eyes and the two blind spots don't overlap. Actually, the eye is an incredible design.\" With that, Meyer stood and walked to the othe r side of the room, where his briefcase was leaning against a desk. He rifled through some papers and finally with drew a photocopy of an article."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"\"In fact,\" he said as he handed it to me, \"biologist George Ayoub wrote this piece to refute the claim that the eye was badly created.\" I glan ced at the technical ar ticle, in which Ayoub, a professor whose expertise is the cellul ar physiology of the retina, concludes: The vertebrate retina provides an excellent example of functiona l-though non-intuitive- design. The design of the retina is responsible for its high acuity and sensitivity. It is simply untrue that the retina is demonstrably suhoptimal, nor is it easy to conceive how it might be modified without signi ficantly decreasing its function. 25 Feeling a little chagrined, I put down the article. \"Okay,\" I conceded, \"maybe that's not a good example of disteleology, but there are a lot of others.\" Meyer interrupted. \"Don't move on too quickly,\" he said. \"There's a good lesson here. People make a lot of claims about bad biological desi gn, but sometimes the entire picture is changed when you hear the rest of the story. For instance , people claim a design is bad because they look at only one parameter and claim it could have been better desi gned. However, engineers know all designs require optimizing a whole suite of parameters, and so trad eoffs are inevitable to create the best overall result.\" That was a mouthful that demanded elabor ation. \"Give me an example,\" I said. He gestured toward the Apple computer in th e open briefcase at my feet. \"One illustration that's sometimes given is a laptop,\" he said. \"Y ou could look at the screen and say, `Bad design; it should have been bigger.' You could look at the memory and say, `Bad design; should have had a larger capacity.' You coul d look at the keyboard and say, `B ad design; should have been easier to use.' \"But the engineer isn't su pposed to be creating the best screen, the best memory, and the best keyboard-he's supposed to be producing the best computer he can given certain size, weight, price, and portability requirements. Could the scr een be bigger? Yes, but then portability suffers. Could the computer have more memory? Sure, but th en the cost goes too high. \"So there are inevitable tradeoffs and compromise s. Each individual part might be criticized for being suboptimal, but that's not the issue. The real issue is how well the overall laptop functions. That's how good engineering works-and that explains some of the examples of supposed disteleology that are raised.\" While that made sense, it didn't answer everyt hing. \"You'll have to adm it that there are other illustrations of disteleology that are mo re difficult to explain away,\" I said. \"I don't deny that,\" he relied. \"Some are just silly. Others are more thoughtful and serious, and they require effort to think through. For instance, Gould claimed the panda's thumb looks jerry-rigged and not designed. Well, experts on the panda say it's a pretty efficient way of scraping the bark off bamboo. In the absence of a standard of good design, which Gould can't provide, it's really hard to sa y whether it's good or bad. It seems to perform its function exceedingly well. \"Other illustrations of disteleology get into i ssues of theodicy, or reconciling belief in God and natural evil. For example, what about viruses and bacteria that harm people? Did God create those? Natural theologians in the nineteenth cent ury believed that if a perfect God created the world, then it would be perfect, so they were ill equipped to deal with Darwin's disteleological arguments. \"However, from a biblical point of view, ther e isn't an expectation that nature would be perfect. The Bible says there has been decay or deterioration because evil entered the world and"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"disrupted the original design. We're not given a ll of the specifics on how this happened, but the biblical book of Romans affirms the natural world is groaning for its redemption, because something has gone wrong with the original creation. 26 Based on the biblical account, we would expect to see both evidence of design in nature as well as evid ence of deterioration or decay- which we do.\" It was time to move on, but I glanced down at th e laptop computer in my briefcase. I had to admit that Meyer's basic explanations about disteleology did make a lot of sense. ROADMAP TO THE FUTURE As we wrapped up our conversation, I felt a lit tle like Meyer did when he attended the Dallas conference in 1985: enthused about the affirmative scientific case for God. So far, the evidence from the telescope to the microscope was poin ting powerfully in the direction of a Creator-a circumstance I never would have dreamed possible back in my days as a student. I was left with an urgent desire to continue my investigation. Still, I also was experiencing an underlying skepticism. Would the case for a Creator hold up when it was scrutinized more carefully and when I could cross-examine experts with all of the questions that plagued me? What fascinating new details would be supplied by those who have spent years studying the various categories of evidence that Me yer had described? Would his case emerge strengthened, weakened, or destroyed? As a legal affairs journalist, I had seen a lot of trials where the prosecutor provided a persuasive overview of the evidence during his opening statement to the jury. But the judge always instructs the jury that the prosecutor's wo rds aren't evidence. They're merely a road map to help them process the subsequent testimony by witnesses. In a sense, this is what Meyer had provided fo r me: an outline of the scientific evidence for theism. Now was the time for me to put experts in cosmology, physics, astronomy, microbiology, biological information, and consciousness to the test and see whether the case is as strong as Meyer claimed. My plan was to start at the literal beginn ing-the origin of the universe, which occurred in an explosion of energy so in comprehensibly powerful that its echo, in effect, is still being heard bill ions of years later. I couldn't wait to get started! THE WRY SMILE OF GOD I didn't want to leave, however, without ta king a few moments to ponder my impressions of Meyer. I especially liked his en dearing blend of a professor's acad emic depth combined with an advocate's savvy and an enthusiast's winsome earne stness. But while we ha d talked a lot about science, a bit about philosophy, an d a little about theology, I realized we hadn't delved into Meyer's personal reflections. His journey from scientist to intelligent design advocate was fascinating to me, and I was curious about th e state of Stephen Meyer's spiritual life. \"Over the years as you've studied the scientific evidence that supports theism, how has this affected your faith?\" I asked. \"It has strengthened it, no question,\" he replie d. \"The trend is definitely toward more discoveries that point toward G od, and that excites me. More and more people are going to find themselves open to God as a result of new findings that make theistic beli ef the best explanation for the evidence of nature.\" He stopped at that. It was a safe answer, but I could tell he was weighing whether he should risk more. I sensed he was the kind of person who would be more co mfortable extolling the"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"virtues of microbiology than opening up about something as pe rsonal as his own relationship with God. But as I sat quietly and list ened, he was about to prove me wrong. \"One thing I haven't told you about my spiritual journey,\" he continue d, \"is that for a two- year period in my life, I was very attracted to Nietzsche's vers ion of existentialism. Nietzsche had a different objection than the ones we've been talking about. He asked, Why should God rule and I serve? This resonated with me. Why should a cond ition of my happiness be submission to the will of God? I sensed I couldn't be happy without him; I knew my bad lifestyle only brought misery. So I ended up literally sh aking my fist at God in a wh eat field in Washington state. \"My point is that the intellectual rebellion the apos tle Paul talks about is very true in my own life. Even in my Christian thinki ng today, I find a tendency to slide ba ck into what Paul refers to as the natural mind. And here's what the scientific ev idence for God does for me: it realigns me. It helps me recognize that despit e my natural tendency toward se lf-focus and self-absorption, I can't ignore what God has accomplished in this world to let everyone kn ow that he is real, that he is the Creator, and that we need to get right with him. \"I see this not only in cosmology and physics and biolo gy, but also in the historical revelation of the Bible, principally in the re velation of Jesus Christ himself. He is so compelling! Einstein thought so. Napoleon thought so. This Nazarene cap tivated their attention, and he continues to captivate mine. \"I remember thinking at one point that if the Jesus of the Bibl e weren't real, I would need to worship the person who created the character. Jesus is so beyond what I can comprehend! And the evidence for God in nature constantly challe nges me to a deeper and fuller relationship with him. My study of the scientific evidence isn't sepa rate from my life as a Christian; it 's marbled throughout that experience. \"I remember when I first began teaching a college course on the evidence for God, I got flack from some people who claimed that these kinds of arguments can produce an idol of the mind or make science a god. I felt a little reticent for a while-but no longer. I've come to an even stronger conviction that this is ev idence that God has used to reveal himself to us. \"I look at the stars in the night sky or re flect on the structure and information-bearing properties of the DNA molecule, and these are o ccasions for me to worship the Creator who brought them into existence. I think of the wry smile that might be on the lips of God as in the last few years all sorts of evid ence for the reliability of the Bible and for his creation of the universe and life have come to light. I believ e he has caused them to be unveiled in his providence and that he delights when we discover his fingerprints in the vastness of the universe, in the dusty relics of paleontology, a nd in the complexity of the cell. \"So exploring the scientific and historical ev idence for God is not only a cognitive exercise, but it's an act of worship for me. It's a way of giving the Creator the credit and honor and glory that are due to him. To attribute creation to a mere natural process is a form of idolatry to which we're all prone. I don't judge my naturalistic co lleagues for being prone to that. That's how I'm constituted as well. All of us have a tendency to minimize God, to think and behave as if we weren't really immersed in his creation and that we aren't ourselves the product of his unimaginable creative power. \"Looking at the evidence-in nature and in Scri pture-reminds me over and over again of who he is. And it reminds me of who I am too-someone in need of him.\" "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" FOR FURTHER EVIDENCE More Resources on This Topic Dembski, William.

Astrophysicist C. J. Ishamz My eyes scanned the magazines at the newsstand near my home. A beautiful woman graced Glamour. Sleek, high-performance cars streaked across the front of Motor Trend. And there on the cover of Discover magazine, sitting by itself, unadorned, floating in a sea of pure white b ackground, was a simple red sphere. It was smaller than a tennis ball, tinier than a Titleist-just three quarters of an inch in diameter, not too much bigger than a marble. As staggering as it seemed, it represented the actual size of the entire universe when it was just an infinitesimal fraction of one second old. Cried out the headline: Where Did Everything Come From? Thousands of years ago, the Hebrews believed they had the answer: \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth,\" opens the Bible. 4 Everything began, they claimed, with the primordial fiat lux-the voice of God commanding light into existence. But is that a simplistic superstition or a divinely inspired insight? What do the cosmologists-scientists who devote their lives to studying the origin of the uni verse-have to say about the issue? It seemed to me that the beginning of everythi ng was a good place to start my investigation into whether the affirmative evidence of science points toward or away from a Creator. At the time, I wasn't particularly interested in internal Christian debates over whether the world is young or old. The \"when\" wasn't as important to me as the \"how\" how do scientific models and theories explain the origin of all?\" \"In the beginning there was an explosion,\" e xplained Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Weinberg in his book The First Three Minutes. \"Not an explosion like those familiar on Earth,"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"starting from a definite center a nd spreading out to engulf more and more of the circumambient air, but an explosion which occurred simultane ously everywhere, filling all space from the beginning with every particle of matter ru shing apart from every other particle. Within the tiniest split second, the temper ature hit a hundred thousand million degrees Centigrade. \"This is much hotter than in the center of even the hottest star, so hot, in fact, that none of the components of ordina ry matter, molecules, or atoms, or even the nuclei of atoms, could have held together,\" he wrote. 8 The matter rushing apart, he explained, consiste d of such elementary particles as negatively charged electrons, positively charged positrons, and neutrinos, which lack both electrical charge and mass. Interestingly, there were also photons: \"T he universe,\" he said, \"was filled with light.\" 9 \"In three minutes,\" wrote Bill Bryson in A Short History of Nearly Everything, \"ninety-eight percent of all the matter there is or will ever be has been produced. We have a universe. It is a place of the most wondrous and gr atifying possibility, and beautiful , too. And it was all done in about the time it takes to make a sandwich. \"10 The most intriguing question is what caused th e universe to suddenly sp ring into existence. For Bryson and many others, its mere presence so mehow seems to explain itself. In a chapter called \"How to Build a Universe,\" he vaguely speculates on exotic theories about a \"false vacuum,\" or \"scalar field,\" or \"vacuum energy\"-some sort of \"quality or thing\" that may have \"introduced a measure of instability into the no thingness that was\" and thus sparked the Big Bang through which emerge d the entire universe. \"It seems impossible that you could get something from nothing,\" he said, \"but the fact that once there was nothing and now there is a un iverse is evident proof that you can.\" 11 Yet could there be another explanation that better accounts for the evidence? Might the mysterious causation be divi ne? Maybe Edward Milne was right when he capped his mathematical treatise on rela tivity by saying: \"As to the first cause of the Universe ... that is left for the reader to insert, but our picture is incomplete without Him.\" I knew this investigation would ta ke me into the slippery worl d of theoretical physics, where it's sometimes difficult to discern between what's profoundly scholarly and wh at's just plain silly. That was well-illustrated in late 2002 when a debate broke out over a highly speculative theory from two French mathematical physicists (who happened to he twins) about what might have preceded the Big Bang. As amazing-and amusing-as it seems, the scie ntific community couldn't figure out whether the brothers \"are really genius es with a new view of the mome nt before the universe began or simply earnest scientists who are in over their heads and spouting nonsense,\" said a New York Times article that featured the provocative headline: \"Are They a) Geniuses or b) Jokers?\" While one professor found their work \"intrigu ing,\" another dismisse d it as \"nutty.\" Yet another protested: \"Scientifically, it's clearly more or less complete nonsense, but these days that doesn't much distinguish it from a lot of the rest of the literature.\" The journal that published a paper by the disputed scientists, who had both r eceived their doctorates with the lowest passing grades, later repudiated it. 13 Obviously, delving into the dawning of the universe-way back to the first 1/10 million trillion trillion trillionths of a second, which is the furthest back scientists believe they can peer- is going to require a certain degree of speculation. Theories abound. Conceded one prominent cosmologist from Stanford University: \"The se are very close to religious questions.” As for myself, I wasn't interested in unsupported conjecture or armchair musings by pipe-puffing theorists. I wanted the hard facts of mathematic s, the cold data of cosmology, and only the most"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"reasonable inferences that can be drawn from them . And that's what sent me to Georgia to visit the home of a widely published expert who has studied and debated these issues for decades. INTERVIEW #3: WILLIAM LANE CRAIG, PHD, THD As a college student who graduated in 1971, Bill Craig had been taught that various arguments for the existence of God were weak, outdated, and ultimately ineffective. And that's what he believed-until he happened upon philosopher Stuart C. Hackett's 1957 book, The Resurrection of Theism. This dense tome never burned up the best-se ller list. In fact, the self-effacing Hackett commented years later that \"the book fell stillbor n from the press because of its heavy style and technical context.\" Still, it absolutely stunned Craig. Hackett is a brilliant thinker who took thes e theistic arguments seriously, rigorously defending them from every objection he could fi nd or imagine. One argument in the book was that the universe must have had a beginning and, therefore, a Creator . Craig was so intrigued that he decided to use his doctoral studies under British theologian John Hick to come to a resolution in his own mind concerning the soundness of this argument. Would it really withstand scrutiny? Craig ended up writing his dissertation on the topic-an exercise that launched him into a lifetime of exploring cosmology. Craig's books include a landmark debate with atheist Quentin Smith called Theism, Atheism and Big Bang Cosmology, published by Oxford University Press; The Kalam Cosmological Argument; The Existence of God and the Be ginning of the Universe; The Cosmological Argument from Plato to Leibniz; and Reasonable Faith, as well as contribu tions on this and related topics to the books Does God Exist?; Faith and Reas on; A Companion to Philosophy of Religion; Questions of Time and Tense; Mere Creation; The History of Science and Religion in the Western Tradition; Naturalism: A Critical Appraisal; and God and Time. His articles on cosmological issues also have appeared in a wide range of scientific and philosophical journals, including Astrophysics and Space Science, Nature, The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, The Journal of Philosophy, and International St udies in the Philosophy of Science. A member of nine professional societies, incl uding the American Philosophical Association, the Science and Religion Forum, the American Scientific Affiliation, and the Philosophy of Time Society, Craig currently is a research professor at the Talbot School of Theology. I hardly needed directions to Craig's subur ban Atlanta home. In previous visits, I had interviewed him for The Case for Christ and The Case for Faith, both times walking away thoroughly impressed by his scholarly depth and disarming sincerity. He has an uncanny ability to communicate complex concepts in accessible and yet technically accurate language-a rare skill that I would certainly put to the test again with this challenging subject. Craig answered the front door we aring a short-sleeved shirt, dark blue shorts, and brown moccasins. We descended a short flight of stairs to his office, where a soft, humid breeze wafted through a half-opened window. He sa t behind his desk and leaned b ack in his chair, clasping his hands behind his head. I pulled up a chair and set up my tape recorder. We were ready to investigate wh at Craig himself believes to be \"one of the most plausible arguments for God's existence\" 1 -an argument based on evidence th at the universe is not eternal, but that it had a beginning in the Big Bang. "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"THE KALAM COSMOLOGICAL ARGUMENT \"You're a famous proponent of an argument for God's existence that's formally called the 'kalam cosmological argument,\"' I said in opening our conversation. \"Before you define what that is, though, give me some background. What does kalam mean?\" \"Let me describe the origins of the argument,\" he said. \"In ancient Gree ce, Aristotle believed that God isn't the Creator of the universe but that he simply imbues order into it. In his view, both God and the universe are eternal. Of course, that contradicted the Hebrew notion that God created the world out of nothing. So Christians later sought to re fute Aristotle. One prominent Christian philosopher on the topic was John Phil oponus of Alexandria, Egypt, who lived in the fourth century. He argued that the universe had a beginning. \"When Islam took over North Africa, Muslim th eologians picked up these arguments, because they also believed in creation. So while this tr adition was lost to the Christian West, it began to be highly developed within Islamic medieval theology. One of th e most famous Muslim proponents was al-Ghazali, w ho lived from 1058 to 1111. \"These arguments eventually got passed back into Latin-speakin g Christendom through the mediation of Jewish thinkers, who lived side-by-si de with Muslim theologians, particularly in Spain, which at that time had been conquered by the Muslims. They became hotly debated. \"Bonaventure, the Italian philo sopher, supported the arguments in the thirteenth century; John Locke, the British philosopher, used them in the seventeenth century, though I don't know if he knew of their Islamic orig ins; and eventually they found their way to Immanuel Kant, the German philosopher, in the eighteenth century. \"Now, back to your question about the word kalam-it reflects the argument's Islamic origin. It's an Arabic word that means `speech' or `d octrine,' but it came to characterize the whole medieval movement of Isla mic theology. That was called kalam-this highly academic theology of the Middle Ages, which later evaporated.\" I spoke up. \"Obviously, none of these early philo sophers knew about any of the scientific evidence for the origin of the universe,\" I said. \"How did they argue th at the universe had a beginning?\" \"They relied on philosophical and mathemati cal reasoning,\" he said. \"However, when scientists in the last century began to discove r hard data about the Big Bang, this provided a more empirical foundation.\" \"How do you frame the kalam argument?\" \"As formulated by al-Ghazali, the argument has th ree simple steps: `Whatever begins to exist has a cause. The universe began to exist. Therefore, the universe has a cause.' Then you can do a conceptual analysis of what it means to be a cause of the universe, and a striking number of divine attributes can be identified.\" I decided to work my way through all three steps of al-Ghazali's nearly millennium-old argument, starting with a point thatsurprisingly-has become more and more disputed in recent years. STEP #1: WHATEVER BEGINS TO EXIST HAS A CAUSE \"When I first began to defend the kalam argument,\" Craig said, \"I anticipated that its first premise-that whatever begins to exist has a cause-would be accepted by virtually everyone. I thought the second premise-that th e universe began to exist-would be much more controversial. But the scientific evidence has accumulated to the extent that atheists are finding it difficult to deny that the universe had a beginning. So they've been forced to attack the first premise"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"instead.\" Craig shook his head. \"To me, this is absolutely bewildering!\" he declar ed, his voice rising in dismay. \"It seems metaphysically necessary that anything which begins to exist has to have a cause that brings it into being. Things don't just pop into existence, un caused, out of nothing. Yet the atheist Quentin Smith concluded our book on the topic by claiming that `the most reasonable belief is that we came from nothing, by nothi ng, and for nothing.' That sounds like a good con- clusion to the Gettysburg Address of Atheism! It simply amazes me that anyone can think this is the most rational view. \"Generally, people who take this position don't try to prove the premise is false, because they can't do that. Instead, they fold their arms and pl ay the skeptic by saying, `You can't prove that's true.' They dial their degree of skepticism so high that nothing could possibly convince them.\" \"On the other hand,\" I interjected, \"they have ev ery right to play the skeptic. After all, the burden of proof should be on you to present affirmative evidence to establish this first premise.\" Craig conceded my point with a nod. \"Yes, but you shouldn't demand unreasonable standards of proof,\" he cautioned. I asked, \"What positive proof can you offer?\" \"In the first place,\" he replied, \"this first prem ise is intuitively obvious once you clearly grasp the concept of absolute nothingness. You see, the idea that things can come into being uncaused out of nothing is worse than magic. At least when a magician pulls a rabbit out of a hat, there's the magician and the hat! \"But in atheism, the universe just pops in to being out of nothing, with absolutely no explanation at all. I think once people understand the concept of absolute nothingness, it's simply obvious to them that if something has a beginni ng, that it could not have popped into being out of nothing but must have a cause th at brings it into existence.\" Admittedly, that was difficult to dispute, but I needed something more substantial. \"Can you offer anything harder than just intuition? What scie ntific evidence is there?\" \"Well, we certainly have empirical evidence for the truth of this premise. This is a principle that is constantly confirmed and never falsified. We never see things coming into being uncaused out of nothing. Nobody worries that while he's away at work, say, a horse might Pop into being, uncaused, out of nothing, in his living room, a nd be there defiling the carpet. We don't worry about those kinds of things, because they never happen. \"So this is a principle that is constantly verified by science. At least, Lee, you have to admit that we have better reason to thi nk it's true than it's false. If you're presented with the principle and its denial, which way does the evidence poin t? Obviously, the premise is more plausible than its denial.\" Still, my research had yielded at least one substan tive objection to kalam's first premise. It emanates from the wacky world of quantum physics, where all kinds of strange, unexpected things happen at the subatomic level-a level, by the way, at which the entire universe existed in its very earliest stages, when electrons, protons, and neutrinos were bursting forth in the Big Bang. Maybe our commonplace understanding of cause-a nd-effect doesn't apply in this circus- mirror environment of \"quantum weirdness,\" a pl ace where, as science writer Timothy Ferris writes, \"the logical founda tions of cla ssical science are violated.\" 19 IS THE UNIVERSE A FREE LUNCH? I pulled out the copy of the Discover magazine that I had been prompted to purchase after I"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"had seen the marble-sized universe on its cove r. I flipped it open and read the following to Craig: Quantum theory ... holds that a vacuum ... is subject to quantum uncertainties. This means that things can materialize out of th e vacuum, although they tend to vanish back into it quickly... . Theo retically, anything-a dog, a house, a planet-can pop into existence by means of this quantum quirk, which physicis ts call a vacuum fluctuation. Probability, however, dictates that pairs of subatomic pa rticles ... are by far the most likely creations and that they will last extremely briefl y.... The spontaneous, persistent creation of something even as large as a molecule is profoundly unlikely. Nevertheless, in 1973 an assistant professor at Columbia University named Edward Tryon suggested that the entire universe might have come into existence th is way.... The whole universe may be, to use [MIT physicist Alan] Guth's phrase, \"a free lunch.\" 20 I closed the magazine and tosse d it on Craig's desk. \"Maybe Tryon was right when he said, `I offer the modest proposal that our universe is si mply one of those things which happen from time to time.' “ Craig was listening intently. \"O kay, that's a good question,\" he replied. \"These subatomic particles the article talks about ar e called `virtual particles.' They are theoretical entities, and it's not even clear that they actually exist as oppos ed to being merely th eoretical constructs. \"However, there's a much more important point to be made about this. You see, these particles, if they are real, do not come out of nothing. The quantum vacuum is not what most people envision when they think of a vacuum-that is, absolutely nothing. On the contrary, it's a sea of fluctuating energy, an arena of violent activ ity that has a rich physical structure and can be described by physical laws. These particles are thought to originate by fluctuations of the energy in the vacuum. \"So it's not an example of something coming in to being out of nothing, or something coming into being without a cause. The quantum vacuum and the energy locked up in the vacuum are the cause of these particles. And then we have to ask, well, what is the origin of the whole quantum vacuum itself? Where does it come from?\" He let that question linger before continuing. \"You've simp ly pushed back the issue of creation. Now you've got to account for how this very active ocean of fluctuating energy came into being. Do you see what I'm saying? If qua ntum physical laws operate within the domain described by quantum physics, you can't legitimat ely use quantum physics to explain the origin of that domain itself. You need something tran scendent that's beyond that domain in order to explain how the entire domain came into being. Suddenly, we're back to the origins question.\" Craig's answer satisfied me. In fact, there didn' t seem to be any rati onal objection that could seriously jeopardize the initial assertion of the kalam argument. And it has been that way since the early philosophers bega n to use it centuries ago. \"Even the famous skeptic David Hume didn't deny the first premise,\" Craig noted. \"Hume wrote in 1754, `I never asserted so absurd a proposition as that anything might arise without a cause.' 22 It wasn't until the discovery of scientific confirmation for the beginning of the universe in the twentieth century that people began to say, well, maybe the universe just came from nothing. \"Nobody has defended such an absurd position hi storically,\" said Cr aig, \"which, again, makes me inclined to think this is just a corner they're being backed into by the evidence for the beginning of the universe.\" "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"STEP #2: THE UNIVERSE HAD A BEGINNING Turning to the second premise of the kalam argument, I said to Crai g, \"If we were sitting here a hundred years ago, the idea that the universe began to exist at a specific point in the past would have been very controversial, wouldn't it?\" \"No question about it,\" replied Craig. \"The as sumption ever since the ancient Greeks has been that the material world is eternal. Christia ns have denied this on the basis of biblical revelation, but secular sc ience always assumed the universe's et ernality. Christians just had to say, well, even though the universe appears static, nevertheless it did have a beginning when God created it. So the discovery in the twentieth century that the univers e is not an unchanging, eternal entity was a complete shock to s ecular minds. It was utterly unanticipated.\" Still, I needed evidence. \"How do we really know that the unive rse started at some point in the past?\" I asked. \"What proof is there?\" \"Essentially,\" said Craig, \"there are two pathways toward establishing it. One could be called either mathematical or philosophical, while th e other is scientific. Let's begin with the mathematical argument, which, incidentally, pi cks up on the thinking of Philoponus and the medieval Islamic theologians I mentioned earlier.\" THE PATHWAY OF MATHEMATICS The early Christian and Muslim scholars, Crai g explained, used mathematical reasoning to demonstrate that it was impossible to have an infinite past. Their conclusion, therefore, was that the universe's age must be finite-t hat is, it must have had a beginning. \"They pointed out that absurdi ties would result if you were to have an actually infinite number of things,\" he said. \"Sin ce an infinite past would involve an actually infinite number of events, then the past simply can't be infinite.\" It took a moment for that statement to sink i n. I have always been a reluctant student of mathematics, especially such esoteric permutati ons as transfinite arithmetic. Before we could venture into any mathematical complexities, I reached over and pushed the \"pause\" button on my tape recorder. \"Hold on a minute, Bill,\" I said. \"If I'm going to track with you on this, you're going to have to give me some illustrations to clarify things.\" Craig already had some in mind. \"Okay, no problem,\" he replied. When I turned the recorder back on, he continued. \"Let's use an example involving marbles,\" he sa id. \"Imagine I had an infinite number of marbles in my possession, and that I wanted to gi ve you some. In fact, suppose I wanted to give you an infinite number of marbles. One way I coul d do that would be to give you the entire pile of marbles. In that case I would have zero marbles left for myself. \"However, another way to do it would be to gi ve you all of the odd numbe red marbles. Then I would still have an infinity left over for myself , and you would have an infinity too. You'd have just as many as I would-and, in fact, each of us would have just as many as I originally had before we divided into odd and even! Or another approach would be for me to give you all of the marbles numbered four and higher. That way, you w ould have an infinity of marbles, but I would have only three marbles left. \"What these illustrations demonstrate is that the notion of an actual infinite number of things leads to contradictory results. In the first case in which I gave you all the marbles, infinity minus infinity is zero; in the second case in which I gave you all the odd-numbered marbles, infinity minus infinity is infinity; and in the third case in which I gave you all the marbles numbered four"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"and greater, infinity minus infinity is three. In each case, we have subtracted the identical number from the identical number, but we have come up with nonidentical results. \"For that reason, mathematicians are forbid den from doing subtra ction and division in transfinite arithmetic, because this woul d lead to contradictions. You see, the idea of an actual infinity is just conceptual; it exists only in our minds. Working within certain rules, mathematicians can deal with infinite quantities and infinite numbers in the conceptual realm. However-and here's the point-its not descriptive of what can happen in the real world. \" I was following Craig so far. \"You're saying, then, that you couldn't have an infinite number of events in the past.\" \"Exactly, because you would run into similar pa radoxes,\" he said. \"Substi tute `past events' for `marbles,' and you can see the absurd ities that would result. So the un iverse can't have an infinite number of events in its pas t; it must have had a beginning. \"In fact, we can go further. Even if you could ha ve an actual infinite number of things, you couldn't form such a collection by adding one me mber after another. That's because no matter how many you add, you can always add one more befo re you get to infinit y. This is sometimes called the Impossibility of Traversing the Infinite. \"But if the past really were infinite, then th at would mean we have managed to traverse an infinite past to arrive at toda y. It would be as if someone had managed to count down all of the negative numbers and to arrive at zero at the present moment. Such a task is intuitively nonsense. For that reason as well, we can concl ude there must have b een a beginning to the universe.\" Still, I spotted an inconsistency that threaten ed to unravel Craig's ar gument. \"If the idea of the universe being infinitely old leads to absurd conclusions, then what about the idea of God being infinitely old?\" I asked. \"Doesn't your reas oning also automatically rule out the idea of an eternal deity?\" \"That depends,\" he said. \"It rules out the concept of a God who has endured through an infinite past time. But that's not the classic idea of God. Time and space are creations of God that began at the Big Bang. If you go back beyond the begi nning of time itself, th ere is simply eter- nity. By that, I mean eternity in the sense of timelessness. God, the eter nal, is timeless in his being. God did not endure through an infinite amount of time up to the mome nt of creation; that would be absurd. God transcends time. He's beyond time. Once God creates the universe, he could enter time, but that's a different topic altogether.\" I quickly reviewed in my mind what Craig had said so far, concluding that it was logically coherent. \"How convincing do you think th e mathematical pathway is?\" I asked. \"Well, I'm convinced of it!\" he replied with a chuckle. \"In fact , this is such a good argument that even if I were living in the nineteenth cen tury, when there was little scientific evidence for the beginning of the universe, I would still believ e that the universe is finite in the past on the basis of these arguments. For me, the scientific evidence is merely confir mation of a conclusion already arrived at on the basis of philosophical reasoning.\" THE PATHWAY OF SCIENCE At this point, we turned the corn er to begin discussing the scientific evidence for the universe being created in the Big Bang billions of years ago. \"What discoveries began pointing scientists toward this model?\" I asked. \"When Albert Einstein developed his general theory of relativ ity in 1915 and started applying it to the universe as a whole, he was shocked to discover it didn't allow for a static universe."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"According to his equations, the universe should either be exploding or imploding. In order to make the universe static, he had to fudge his eq uations by putting in a factor that would hold the universe steady. \"In the 1920s, the Russian mathematician Alexander Friedman and the Belgium astronomer George Lemaitre were able to develop models based on Einstein's theory. They predicted the universe was expanding. Of course, this meant th at if you went backward in time, the universe would go back to a single origin before which it didn't exist. Astronomer Fred Hoyle derisively called this the Big Bangand the name stuck! \"Starting in the 1920s, scientists began to fi nd empirical evidence that supported these purely mathematical models. For instance, in 1929, th e American astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the light coming to us from distant galaxies appears to be redder than it should be, and that this is a universal feature of galaxies in all pa rts of the sky. Hubble expl ained this red shift as being due to the fact that the galaxies are movi ng away from us. He concluded that the universe is literally flying apart at enormous velocities. Hubble's astronomical obser vations were the first empirical confirmation of the pred ictions by Friedman and Lemaitre. \"Then in the 1940s, George Gamow predicted that if the Big Bang really happened, then the background temperature of the univ erse should be just a few degr ees above absolute zero. He said this would be a relic from a very early stage of the universe. Sure enough, in 1965, two scientists accidentally discove red the universe's background radi ation-and it was only about 3.7 degrees above absolute zero. There's no explanation for this apart from the fact that it is a vestige of a very early and a very dens e state of the universe, which was predicted by the Big Bang model. \"The third main piece of evidence for the Big Bang is the origin of light elements. Heavy elements, like carbon and iron, are synthesized in th e interior of stars and then exploded through supernovae into space. But the very, very light elements, like deuterium and helium, cannot have been synthesized in the interior of stars, because you would need an even more powerful furnace to create them. These elements must have been forged in the furnace of the Big Bang itself at temperature s that were billions of degrees. There's no other explanation. \"So predictions about the Big Bang have been consistently verified by scientific data. Moreover, they have been corroborated by the fa ilure of every attempt to falsify them by alternative models. Unquestionabl y, the Big Bang model has impre ssive scientific credentials.\" \"And that,\" I observed, \"has surprised a lot of people.\" \"It was an absolute shock!\" he declared. \"Up to this time, it was taken for granted that the universe as a whole was a static , eternally existing object.\" I knew, however, that there have been more recent refinements of the standard Big Bang model. \"Most scientists would add inflation theory to the description of how the universe got started,\" I said. \"How has that chan ged the way we look at the Big Bang?\" \"Yes, inflation is a wrinkle that most theorist s would add,\" he acknowledged. He paused for a moment, then added: \"Personally, though, I think the reasons for it are a bit suspect.\" That took me aback. \"Why is that?\" \"You see, the Big Bang was not a chaotic, disorder ly event. Instead, it appears to have been fine-tuned for the existence of intelligent life with a complexity and precision that literally defies human comprehension. In other words, the uni verse we see today-and our very existence- depends upon a set of highly special initial cond itions. This phenomenon is strong evidence that the Big Bang was not an accide nt, but that it was designed. Th eorists who are uncomfortable about this want to avoid the problem by trying to explain how you can get a univ erse like ours"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"without these special initial conditions. Inflation is one attempt to do this.\" I had read about inflation theory in several books and articles, but I asked Craig to describe it so that we were working from a common definition. \"Inflation says that in the ver y, very early history of the unive rse, the universe underwent a period of super-rapid, or `infla tionary,' expansion. Then it sett led down to the more leisurely expansion we observe today. This inflationary expansion supposedly avoids the problem of the initial conditions of the universe by blowing them out beyond the range of what we can observe. So in a sense, inflation isn't something that is motivated by the scientific evidence; it's motivated b y a desire to avoid these special initial conditions that are pr esent in the standard model. \"And inflation itself has been plagued with pr oblems. There are prob ably fifty different inflationary models. Nobody knows which, if any, is correct. There isn't any empirical test that proves inflation has occurred. So even though most theorists accept inflation today, I'm rather suspicious of the whole thing, because it app ears to be motivated by a philosophical bias.\" I stopped to analyze Craig's comments. As I thought about inflationary theory, I didn't understand how it would erode any one's confidence in the overall Big Bang model. \"Since this inflationary period supposed ly happened a microsecond after the Big Bang occurred,\" I said, \"then it really doesn't affect the question of the origin of the universe.\" \"That's right,\" Craig replied. \"Prior to infl ation, the universe still shrinks back to a singularity.\" I put up my hand to stop him. \"A what?\" \"A singularity,\" he repeated. \"That's the state at which the spacetime cu rvature, along with temperature, density, and pressure, becomes infini te. It's the beginning point. It's the point at which the Big Bang occurred.\" I nodded to acknowledge the clar ification. \"Okay,\" I said. \"Then how would you assess the health of the Big Bang model today?\" \"It's the standard paradigm of contemporary cosmology,\" he answ ered. \"I would say that its broad framework is very securely established as a scientific fact. Stephen Hawking has said, `Almost everyone now believes that the universe, and time itself, had a beginning at the Big Bang.\"' 23 By this point in our discussion, Craig had provided compelling facts to support the two premises of the kalam argument. All that remained was its conclusion-and the absolutely staggering implications that logically flow from it. STEP #3: THEREFORE, TH E UNIVERSE HAS A CAUSE In arguing for the existence of God, thirteenth-century Chris tian philosopher Thomas Aquinas always presupposed Aristotle's view that the univers e is eternal. On the ba sis of that difficult assumption, he then sought to prove that God ex ists. Why did he take this approach? Because, Aquinas said, if he were to star t with the premise that the unive rse had a beginning, then his task would be too easy! Obviousl y, if there was a beginning, something had to bring th e universe into existence. But now, modern astrophysics and astronomy have dropped into the lap of Christians precisely the premise that, according to Aquinas, makes God's existence virtually undeniable. Craig offered that story to punch his next point. \"Given that wh atever begins to exist has a cause and that the universe began to exist, there must be some sort of transcendent cause for the origin of the universe,\" Craig told me. \"Even atheist Kai Nielsen said, `Suppose you suddenly hear a loud bang ... and you ask me,"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"`What made that bang?' and I reply, `Nothing, it just happened.' You would not accept that.' 24 He's right, of course. And if a cause is needed fo r a small bang like that, then it's needed for the Big Bang as well. This is an inescapable c onclusion-and it's a stunning confirmation of the millennia-old Judeo-Christian doctrine of creation out of nothing.\" At the time an agnostic, American astronomer R obert Jastrow was forced to concede that although details may differ, \"the essential element in the astronomical a nd biblical accounts of Genesis is the same; the chain of events lead ing to man commenced su ddenly and sharply, at a definite moment in time, in a flash of light and energy.\" 25 But although logic dictates that a cause sp arked the Big Bang, I wondered how much logic can also tell us about its identity. \"What specifically can y ou deduce about this cause?\" I asked Craig. \"There are several qualities we can identify,\" he replied. \"A cause of space and time must be an uncaused, beginningless, timeless, spacele ss, immaterial, persona l being endowed with freedom of will and enormous power,\" he sa id. \"And that is a core concept of God.\" \"Hold on, hold on!\" I insisted. \"M any atheists see a fatal inconsistency. They don't see how you can say the Creator could be `uncaused.' For instance, atheist George Smith says, `If everything must have a cause, how did god become exempt?' 26 In The Necessity of Atheism, David Brooks says: `If everything must have a cause, then the First Cause must be caused and therefore: Who made God? To sa y that this First Cause always existed is to deny the basic assumption of this theory.' 2 What would you say to them?\" Craig's eyebrows shot up. \"Well, that just misses the point!\" he exclaimed. \"Obviously, they're not dealing with the first premise of the kalam argument, which is not that everything has a cause, but that whatever begins to exist has a cause. I don't know of any reputable philosopher who would say everything has a cause. So they're simply not dealing with a correct formulation of the kalam argument. \"And this is not special pleading in the case of God. After all, atheists have long maintained that the universe doesn't need a cause, because it' s eternal. How can they possibly maintain that the universe can be eternal and uncaused, yet God cannot be timeless and uncaused?\" At that point, another objecti on popped into my mind. \"Why does it have to be one Creator?\" I asked. \"Why couldn't multiple Creators have been involved?\" \"My opinion,\" Craig answered, \"is that Ockham's razor would shave away any additional creators.\" \"What's Ockham's razor?\" \"It's a scientific principle that says we should not multiply causes beyond what's necessary to explain the effect. Since one Crea tor is sufficient to explain the effect, you would be unwarranted in going beyond the evidence to posit a plurality.\" \"That seems a little soft to me,\" I said. \"Well, it's a universally accepted principle of scientific methodology,\" he replied. \"And besides, the kalam argument can't prove everything about th e Creator. Nothing restricts us from looking at wider considerations. For instance, Jesus of Nazareth proclaimed the truth of monotheism, and he was vindicated by his resurrection from the dead, for which we have convincing historical evidence. 28 Consequently, we have good grounds for believing that what he said was true.\" I conceded the point, but at the same time my mind began to fill with other objections concerning the identity of the universe's cau se. Among the most troubling was whether the kalam argument can tell us if the Creator is personal, as Christians believe, or merely an impersonal"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"force, as many New Age adherents maintain. THE PERSONAL CREATOR \"You said earlier that there's evidence that the cause of the universe wa s personal,\" I said. \"I don't see how this can be logically deduced. In fact, Smith has complained that arguments like yours cannot establish whether the first cause was, or is, alive or conscious-'and,' he says, `an inanimate, unconscious god is of little use to theism.' 29 He has a point there, doesn't he?\" 110 THF CASE FOR A CKEATOIZ \"No, I don't think so,\" said Craig. \"One of the most remarkable features of the kalam argument is that it gives us more than just a tran scendent cause of the universe. It also implies a personal Creator.\" \"How so?\" Craig leaned back into his chair. \"There are two types of explanations-scientific and personal,\" he began, adopting a more professori al tone. \"Scientific e xplanations explain a phenomenon in terms of certain initial conditi ons and natural laws, which explain how those initial conditions evolved to produce the phenome non under consideration. By contrast, personal explanations explain things by means of an agent and that agent's volition or will.\" I interrupted to ask Craig for an illustration. He obliged me by saying: \"Imagine you walked into the kitchen and saw the ke ttle boiling on the stove. You as k, `Why is the kettle boiling?' Your wife might say, `Well, because the kineti c energy of the flame is conducted by the metal bottom of the kettle to the water, causing the wa ter molecules to vibrate faster and faster until they're thrown off in the form of steam.' That would be a scientific ex planation. Or she might say, `I put it on to make a cup of tea.' That would be a personal explanation. Both are legitimate, but they explain the pheno menon in different ways.\" So far, so good. \"But how does this relate to cosmology?\" \"You see, there cannot be a scien tific explanation of the first st ate of the universe. Since it's the first state, it simply cannot be explained in terms of earlier initial co nditions and natural laws leading up to it. So if there is an explan ation of the first state of the universe, it has to be a personal explanation-that is, an agent who has volition to create it. That would be the first reason that the cause of the universe must be personal. \"A second reason is that because the cause of the universe transcends time and space, it cannot be a physical reality. Instead, it must be nonphysical or immaterial. Well, there are only two types of things that can be timeless and immaterial. One would be abstract objects, like numbers or mathematical entities. However, abst ract objects can't cause anything to happen. The second kind of immaterial reality would be a mind. A mind can be a cause, and so it makes sense that the universe is the product of an unem bodied mind that brought it into existence. \"Finally, let me give you an analogy that will help explain a third reason for why the first cause is personal. Water freezes at zero degrees Centigrade. If the temperature were below zero degrees from eternity past, then any water that was around would be frozen from eternity past. It would be impossible for the water to just begin to freeze a finite time ago. In other words, once the sufficient conditions were met-that is, the temperature was low enough-then the consequence would be that water would automatically freeze. \"So if the universe were just a mechanical c onsequence that would occur whenever sufficient conditions were met, and the suffi cient conditions were met eterna lly, then it would exist from eternity past. The effect would be co-eternal with the cause. \"How do you explain, then, the origin of a finite universe from a timeless cause? I can only"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"think of one explanation: that the cause of the universe is a pe rsonal agent who has freedom of will. He can create a new effect without any an tecedent determining conditions. He could decide to say, `Let there be light,' and the universe wo uld spring into existence. I've never seen a good response to this argument on the part of any atheist.\" Putting the issue a bit simpler, British physicist Edmund Whittaker made a similar observation in his book The Beginning and End of the World. He said, \"There is no ground for supposing that matter and energy existed before and was sudde nly galvanized into action. For what could distinguish t hat moment from all othe r moments in eternity? It is simpler to postulate creation ex nihilo-Divine will constituting Nature from nothingness.\" 30 Craig had made a good case for th e cause of the universe being personal, and yet he offered no evidence concerning whether the Creator is still living today. Perhaps the Creator put the universe into motion and then ceased to exist. Smith also makes this challenge, saying that an argument like Craig's is \"capable only of demonstr ating the existence of a mysterious first cause in the distant past. It does not establish the present existence of the first cause.\" 31 This objection, though, didn't faze Cr aig. \"It's certainly plausible that this being would still exist,\" he said, \"because he transcends the unive rse and is therefore above the laws of nature, which he created. It therefore seems unlikely that anything in the laws of nature could extinguish him. And, of course, Christians believe this Creator has not rema ined silent but has revealed himself decisively in the person, ministry, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, which shows that he's still around and still working in history. \"Again, the kalam argument can't prove everything, and that's fine. We're free to look around for other evidence that the Creator still exists. Let's see if he answ ers prayers, if he raised Jesus from the dead, if he revealed himself in the fu lfillment of prophecy, and so forth. It seems that the burden of proof should be on the person clai ming he did once exist, but he no longer does.\" Even though that seemed to make sense, something inside of me was saying, \"Not so fast!\" The kalam argument was a little too cutand-dried; Cr aig's evidence seemed a bit too airtight. Was his conclusion that a persona l Creator was behind the Big Ba ng really warranted, or might there be a way to get around it? There was too much at stake not to probe every reasonable possibility, including whether there's an explanation that would negate the need for an absolute beginn ing of the universe-and thus eliminate the Creator that the Big Bang implies. ALTERNATIVES TO THE BIG BANG Efforts to come up with alternatives to the standard Big Bang model have intensified in recent years. Many scientists are troubled by the fact that the beginning of the universe necessitates a Creator. Others are perturbed b ecause the laws of physics can't account for the creation event. Einstein admitted the idea of the expanding universe \"irritates me\" 32 (presumably, said one prominent scientist, \"because of its theological implications\") 33 British astronomer Arthur Eddington called it \"repugnant.\" MIT's Phillip Morr ison said, \"I would like to reject it.\" 34 Jastrow said it was \"distasteful to the scientific mind,\" adding: There is a kind of religion in science; it is the religion of a person who believes there is order and harmony in the Universe. Every event can be explained in a rational way as the product of some previous event; every effect must have its cause ; there is no First Cause.... This religious faith of the scientist is violated by the discove ry that the world had a beginning under conditions in which the know n laws of physics are not valid, and as a"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"product of forces or circumstances we cannot discover. When that happens, the scientist has lost control. If he really examined the implications, he would be traumatized. 35 Has this attitude, I asked Crai g, fueled efforts to circumvent the idea of the Big Bang? \"I believe it has. A good example is the Steady State theory proposed in 1948,\" he replied. \"It said that the universe was expand ing all right but claimed that as galaxies retreat from each other, new matter comes into being out of nothi ng and fills the void. So in contradiction to the First Law of Thermodynamics, which says that matter is neither created nor destroyed, the universe is supposedly being constan tly replenished with new stuff.\" The concept was intriguing if nothing else . \"What was the evidence for it?\" I asked. \"There was none!\" Craig exclaimed. \"It neve r secured a single piece of experimental verification. It was motivated purely by a desire to avoid the ab solute beginning of the universe predicted by the Big Bang model-in fact, one of its originators, Sir Fred Hoyle, was quite overt about this. He was very up front about his desire to avoid the metaphysical and theological implications of the Big Bang by proposing a model that was eternal in the past.\" I interrupted. \"Wait a minute, Bill,\" I sa id. Recalling a comment by science philosopher Stephen C. Meyer in my earlier interview, I asked: \"Wouldn't you agree that the motivations behind a theory are independent of its scientific worth?\" \"Yes, yes, I'd agree with that,\" Craig replie d. \"In this case, though, there were no scientific data supporting it. It's a good illustration of how sc ientists are not mere thinking machines but are driven by philosophical and emotional factors as well.\" Rather than try to second-guess the motivations of cosmologists, I decided to ask Craig about several alternatives to the standard Big Bang mode l that have gained currency through the years. Maybe one of them could succeed in t oppling the theistic conclusion of the kalam argument. EXPLORING SAGAN'S COSMOS The first alternative I mentioned to Craig-the Oscillating Model of the universe-was popularized by astronomer Carl Sagan on his Cosmos television program. This theory eliminates the need for an absolute beginning of the unive rse by suggesting that th e universe expands, then collapses, then expands again, and continues in this cycle indefinitely. Inte restingly, Sagan even quoted from Hindu scriptures to sh ow how this is consistent with its cyclical themes. When I asked Craig about Sagan's theory, he said that, yes, he was quite familiar with it. \"That model was popular in the 1960s, particul arly among Russian cosmologists,\" he said. \"In 1968, when I was at the World Congress on Ph ilosophy in Dusseldorf, I heard Soviet bloc cosmologists espousing this model, simply b ecause of their commitment to dialectical materialism. They could not deny the eternality of matter because this was part of Marxist philosophy, and so, despite the evidence, they were holding out hope for the Oscillating Model.\" \"But,\" I interjected, \"support for this model apparently hasn't waned. As recently as 2003, Bill Bryson, in his best-seller A Short History of Nearly Everything, said that `one notion' among scientists is that `we're just one of an eternal cycle of expanding and collapsing universes, like the bladder on an oxygen machine.\"' 36 \"Well, several problems with the Oscillati ng Model have been well known for decades,\" he replied. \"For one thing, it c ontradicts the known laws of phys ics. Theorems by Hawking and Penrose show that as long as the universe is governed by general relativity, the existence of an initial singularity-or beginning-is inevitable, and that it's impo ssible to pass through a singularity to a subsequent state. And there's no known physics that could reverse a contracting universe and"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"suddenly make it bounce before it hits the singular ity. The whole theory was simply a theoretical abstraction. Physics never supported it. \"Another problem is that in order for the univers e to oscillate, it has to contract at some point. For this to happen, the universe would have to be dense enough to generate sufficient gravity that would eventually sl ow its expansion to a halt and then, with increasing rapidity, contract it into a big crunch. Bu t estimates have consistently i ndicated that the universe is far below the density needed to c ontract, even when you include not only its luminous matter, but also all of the invisible dark matter as well. \"Recent tests, run by five different laborator ies in 1998, calculated a ninety-five-percent certainty that the universe will not contract, but that it will expand forever. In fact, in a completely unexpected development, the studies i ndicated that the expansion is not decelerating, but it's actually accelerating. This really puts the nails in the co ffin for the Oscillating Model. \"And one more problem: even if physics allowed the universe to contract , scientific studies have shown that entropy would be con s erved from one cycle to the next. This would have the effect of each expansion getting bigger and bigge r and bigger. Now, trace that backwards in time and what do you get? They get smaller and smaller and s maller, until you finally come to the smallest cycle-and then the beginning of the universe. So Joseph Silk, in his book The Big Bang, estimates that even if the universe were os cillating, it could not have gone through more than a hundred previous osci llations prior to today.\" 37 All of this did, indeed, seem to doom this theo ry. \"Sagan was an agnostic who liked to say that the universe `is all there is, or ever was, or ever will be,' “ I said. \"But you're saying that the evidence indicates-\" \"-that the Oscillating Model itself implies th e beginning of the unive rse which its proponents sought to avoid. That's right,\" Craig said. \"But,\" I pointed out, \"p ermutations of his theory are bein g proposed even today.\" I removed a newspaper article from my briefcase and read the headline to Craig: Princeton Physicist Offers Theory of Cyclic Universe. \"This cosmologist says the Big Bang is not th e beginning of time but a bridge to a pre- existing era,\" I said. \"He says th e universe undergoes an endless se quence of cycles in which it contracts with a big crunch and reemerges in an expanding Big Bang, with trillions of years of evolution in between. He says mysterious `dar k energy' first pushes the universe apart at an accelerating rate, but then it changes its characte r and causes it to contract and then rebound in cycle after cycle.\" Craig was familiar with the concept. \"This model is based on a certain version of string theory, which is an alternative to the standard quark model of particle physics,\" he explained. \"The scenario postulates that our universe is a three-dimensional membrane in a five- dimensional space, and that there's another thre edimensional membrane which is in an eternal cycle of approaching our membrane and collidi ng with it. When this happens, it supposedly causes an expansion of our universe from the poi nt of collision. Then our universe retreats and repeats the cycle again, and on and on. \"The idea is that this five-dimensional unive rse is eternal and begi nningless. So you have a cyclic model of our universe that is expanding, but nevertheless this larger dimensional universe as a whole is eternal.\" Though difficult to conceptualize, this idea had a certain amount of appeal. \"What do you think of this model?\" I asked. \"Well, this isn't even a model, it's just sort of a scenario, because it hasn't been developed."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The equations for string theory haven't even all been stated yet, much less solved. So this is extremely speculative and uncertain. But let's consider it on its merits,\" he said. \"This cyclic scenario is plagued with problems. For one thing, it is inconsistent with the very string theory it's based on! Nobody has been able to solve that problem. Moreover, this is simply the five-dimensional equivalent of a three-dimensional oscilla ting universe. As such, it faces many of the same problems that the old oscillating model did. \"But more interesting is that in 2001, inflati on theorist Alan Guth a nd two other physicists wrote an article on how inflation is not past eterna l. They were able to generalize their results to show that they were also applicable to multidimensional models, like the one in this newspaper article. So it turns out that even the cyclical model in five dime nsions has to have a beginning.\" Craig sighed as he sat back in his chair. \"It's amazing how this falls into a consistent pattern,\" he said. \"Theories designed to avoid the beginning of the universe have either turned out to be untenable, like the Steady State theory, or else they imply the very beginning of the universe that their proponents have been de sperately trying to avoid.\" \"So the future of this cyc lic scenario is ... what?\" \"It will probably provide grist for further ex ploration,\" he said. \"S till, another prominent inflation theorist, Andre Linde, said this con cept has been very popular among journalists and very unpopular among cosmologists.\" \"Speaking of Linde,\" I said, \"he proposed another theory, called chao tic inflation, that would eliminate the need for a beginning point.\" \"That's right,\" Craig said. \"He speculated that maybe inflation this rapid expansion of the universe-never really quits. He said maybe th e universe expands like a balloon, and when it reaches a certain point, then inflation is spaw ned off of it and begins to expand, and then something expands off of that. So you have inflati on begetting inflation bege tting inflation, and it goes on forever. The obvious question, then, is this : could inflation be eter nal in the past? Could eve ry inflationary domain be the creation of a prior domain so that the universe is an eternally inflating and self-reproducing entity?\" \"Is that possible?\" \"I'm afraid not. As I said earlie r, a universe that is eternally inflating to ward the future cannot be past eternal. Two prominent physicists demonstr ated that as far back as 1994. There has to be a beginning at some point in the indefinite past. In Linde's response, he admitted they were correct.\" I thought about another popular alternative: quant um models of the universe, like Edward Tryon's, which I mentioned earlier. There are severa l variations, but basically they claim that our universe is part of a bigger mother universe, which is made up of a quantum vacuum where fluctuations occur and turn into baby universes. Our universe is one of these offspring. While our universe is expanding, the bigger mother universe is infinite and eternal. When I brought up this concept, though, Crai g pointed out two fatal problems with it. \"Remember we said earlier in our conversation th at a quantum vacuum isn't nothing, but that it's a very active sea of fluctuating energy that itself demands an explanation for how it came into being,\" he said. \"What accounts for its beginnin g? And second, there is a positive-that is, a non- zero-probability that a fluctuation would occur and a universe would be spawned at each and every point in this quantum vacuum. \"So if the mother universe were eternal, even tually a universe would have formed at each point. Think about that. Finally these universes would be running into each othe r or coalescing until the entire quantum vacuum in the mother uni verse would be filled with an infinitely old"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"universe, which contradicts our observations. That's why this model hasn't survived. HAWKING'S CHALLENGE Most developments in cosmology live an ob scure existence within the pages of arcane scientific journals, with only a few-often, the most outlandish ones-receiving even the briefest mention in the popular press. Luminaries in th e field, such as Linde and Guth, are hardly household names. But when Stephen William Hawking speaks, the public listens. A theoretical physicist who is currently th e Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University, a post once held by Si r Isaac Newton, Hawking has become a science icon. He has sold millions of copies of A Brief History of Time, although Business Week once quipped that the book is \"the l east-read best-seller ever.\" 40 His celebrity status was validated when he achieved cartoon form on The Simpsons and played a cameo role on Star Trek, where he challenged a holographic Einstein to a game of chess. Hawking, who uses a wheelchair for mobility and a synthesizer for speech due to a progressive neuromuscular disease, has been on a quest for the elusive Theory of Everything, which would unify general relativity with qu antum theory. Along the way, he has proposed a quantum gravity model for the universe that he sa ys eliminates the need for a singularity-that is, the Big Bang. When actress Shirley MacLaine asked Hawk ing whether he believes God created the universe, he replied simply, \"No.” 41 He told the BBC: \"We are such insignificant creatures on a minor planet of a very average star in the out er suburbs of one of a hundred thousand million galaxies. So it is difficult to believe in a Go d that would care about us or even notice our existence.\" 42 In a chapter called \"The Origin and Fate of the Universe\" in A Brief History of Time, Hawking says: \"So long as the universe had a beginning, we could suppose it had a creator. But if the universe is really completely self-cont ained, having no boundary or edge, it would have neither beginning nor end: it would simply be. What place, then, for a creator?\" 43 I broached Hawking's theory to Craig. \"It su re sounds like he has finally managed to put God out of business,\" I said. \"Not quite,\" replied Craig. When I asked him to explain why not, Craig pu lled a piece of paper and pen out of his top drawer. \"Let me draw you two pictures th at will clarify what I mean,\" he said. \"The standard Big Bang theory can be represented by a cone,\" he said, drawing what looked like an empty sugar cone from BaskinRobbins. \"The point of the cone represents the beginning of the universe-the singularity where the Big Ba ng occurred. It's the beginning point, and it has a sharp edge to it. 44 The expansion of the universe, as it gets older and grows, is represented by the cone's overall expanding shape.\" I nodded that I was tracking with him. Then he took a second sheet of paper and began drawing a picture of Hawking's theory. \"Hawking' s model is like a cone, too, except it doesn't come to a point.\" He drew a picture of what re sembled a badminton birdie; instead of coming to a sharp point, the end of the cone was rounded. \"As you can see, there's no singularity. There's no sharp edge. If you we re to start at the mouth of the cone and go backward in time,\" he sa id, his pencil tracing the long side of the cone, \"you would not come back to a beginning point. You would simply follow the curveand suddenly you would find yourself he ading forward in time again.\" This was consistent with the way Hawking's biographers envisioned his theory. They said it would be like walking northward until you reach the North Pole, and then suddenly, if you keep"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"walking, you find yourself heading south. 45 \"There is no beginning and no endno boundaries,\" one writer explained. \"The universe always was, always is, and always shall be.\" 46 Craig put down his pencil. \"Pre sto!\" I exclaimed as I looked at his drawing. \"No beginning, no singularity, no Big Bang-no need for God.\" Craig grimaced. \"Let's think about this for a mi nute before you come to that conclusion,\" he said. THE WORLD OF IM AGINARY NUMBERS \"Has Hawking made a mistake?\" I asked. The mere suggestion sounded impossible! \"I think he has made a philosophical error by thinking that having a be ginning entails having a beginning point. And that's simply not the case,\" Craig replied. He pointed toward his rendering of Hawking's model. \"Granted, there isn't any singular point here, but notice this: the universe is still finite in its past. It still has a beginni ng in the sense that something has a finite past duration. In other words, pick an interval of timesay, a second, a minute, or a year. For any finite interval of tim e you pick, there are only a finite number of equal intervals prior to that time. And in that sense, Hawking's model has a be ginning. Even he says that the universe has an origin out of nothing in the sense that there's absolutely nothing that comes before it. \"So this would be an example of a model that has a beginning but doesn't involve a singularity. That's what many scie ntists are trying to come up with, because the laws of physics would apply all the way back. They don't break dow n in a singularity. And that's more palatable to them.\" Before I could ask another ques tion, Craig added: \"Now, I've been taking Hawking's model at face value, but it's also important to note that he is only able to achieve this rounding-off effect by substituting `imaginary numbers' fo r real numbers in his equations.\" \"What are imaginary numbers?\" \"They are multiples of the square root of negative one,\" he said. \"In this model, they have the effect of turning time into a dimension of space. The problem is that when imaginary numbers are employed, they're just computational devices us ed to grease the equations and get the result the mathematician wants. That's fine, but when you want to get a real, physical result, you have to convert the imaginary numbers into real ones. But Hawking refuses to convert them. He just keeps everything in the imaginary realm.\" \"What happens if you convert the numbers into real ones?\" \"Presto, the singularity reappear s!\" Craig said. \"In fact, the si ngularity is really there the whole time; it's just hidden behind the device of so-called imaginary time. Hawking concedes this in a subsequent book he co-authored with Roger Penrose. 47 He said he doesn't pretend to be describing reality, because he says he doesn't know what reality is. So Hawking himself recognizes that this is not a realistic descripti on of the universe or its origin; it's merely a mathematical way of modeling the beginning of the universe in such a manner that the singularity doesn't appear.\" I was amazed! Even though Hawking's Internet site says his theory implies that the universe \"was completely determined by the laws of science,\" 48 even he wasn't able to successfully write God out of the picture. \"What's important to understand, Lee, is how re versed the situation is from, say, a hundred years ago,\" Craig continue d. \"Back then, Christians had to maintain by faith in the Bible that despite all appearances to the contrary, the un iverse was not eternal but was created out of"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"nothing a finite time ago. Now, the situation is exactly the opposite. \"It is the atheist who has to maintain, by faith, despite all of the evidence to the contrary, that the universe did not have a beginning a finite tim e ago but is in some inexplicable way eternal after all. So the shoe is on th e other foot. The Christian can st and confidently within biblical truth, knowing it's in line with mainstream astrophysics and c osmology. It's the atheist who feels very uncomfortable and marginalized today.\" As I sat there in Craig's office, my mind c ould conjure up no rational scenario that could derail the inexorable logic of the kalam argument. The philosophical and scientific evidence of contemporary cosmology was pointing persuasive ly toward the conclusion that a personal Creator of the universe does exist. This was powerful stuffand I st ill had a long way to go in my investigation. I wondered, however, how a cosmologist or physi cist might respond to Craig. As compelling as the kalam argument undeniably is, does it really have the potential to change the mind of a scientist? Or would it merely be come fodder for more and more creative-or, as some might say, desperate-counter-arguments and objections? Christians often caution that a skeptic cannot be argued into the faith. Yet if someone were si ncerely open-minded, could Craig's case be suf- ficient to prompt a personal verdict in favor of God? I mused about this aloud to Craig. He thought for a moment and then launched into a fascinating story about a doctoral disserta tion, a handmade booklet, and a changed life. PHYSICAL LAWS, SPIRITUAL LAWS While in Germany to pursue his second doctora te, Bill and his wife , Jan, were attending a convention of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, a prestig ious German organization devoted to promoting internati onal research cooperati on between scholars. While chatting with various scientists, they met a prominent Eastern European phys icist, who described for them how physics had destroyed her belief in God. \"She said that now when she looks at the worl d, all she sees is dar kness without and darkness within,\" Craig recalled. \"I rememb er how that struck me so forcef ully. What a description of the modern world's predicament-utter meaninglessness and despair. \"Suddenly, Jan spoke up. `You shou ld read Bill's doctoral disse rtation,\" she said. `He uses physics to prove the existence of God.\"' Craig's eyes got wide as he relived the scene. \"My first thought was, `Oh, no! What is this famous physicist going to say?' But she replied that, yes, she would be very in terested in reading it. \"So we gave her a copy of my dissertation on the kalam cosmological argument-the very kind of material we've been di scussing today, Lee. As she read it over the coming days, she started to get more and more excited. She told me, `I know these people you're quoting! These are my colleagues!' Finally, she returned the di ssertation to us and announced, `I now believe in the existence of God. Thank you so much for restoring my faith in him.' \"We were thrilled! We said, `Would you like to know him in a personal way?' She was a bit hesitant, but she said, 'Uh, of course.' So we asked her to meet us that night in the local restaurant. \"That afternoon Jan and I prepared a little handwritten version of the Four Spiritual Laws, which spell out how a person can become a follower of Jesus. 49 When we sat down with her at the meal that night, we opened the booklet and r ead the first sentence: `J ust as there are physical laws that govern the physical universe, so there are spiritual laws that govern your relationship"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"with God.' And she said, `Oh, phys ical laws! Spiritual laws! This is something I can understand! This is just for me!' \"Finally, we got to the point in the booklet that asks whether God is outside of your life or on the throne of your life. She clamped her hand over the booklet and said, 'Ah, this is so personal! I just can't answer at th is time.' We said, `That's all right. Le t us just explain how you can receive Christ as your personal savior.' We described how she could pray to ask God to forgive her wrongdoing and to receive Jesus as her forgiver and leader. After that, we let her take the booklet home with her. \"Well, the next day when we saw her, her face was just radiant with joy! She told us she had gone home that night and there in her room had pray ed to give her life to Christ. Then she took all her tranquilizers a nd booze and flushed them down the toilet! \"We gave her a copy of the New Testament and parted ways for several months. When we saw her later at another convention, we wondered what the status of her faith would be. But she had the same joy, the same radiance, and she greet ed us with love and told us that her most precious possessions were her New Testament and her handmade Four Spiritual Laws.\" Bill smiled. \"You asked whether God can use cosmol ogy to change the life of a scientist,\" he said. \"Yes, I've seen it. I've seen it happen with all kinds of skeptics. Once I gave a talk at a college in Canada on the kalam argument. Afterward a student sai d, `I've been an agnostic all my life. I've never heard anything like this. I now be lieve that God exists! I can hardly wait to go share this with my brother, who's an atheist.\"' Craig glanced out the window as he pondered what else to say. Then he turned to me once more. \"Certainly there have been earlier ages when the culture was more sympathetic toward Christianity,\" he said. \"But I th ink it's indisputable that there has never been a time in history when the hard evidence of science was more confirmatory of belief in God than today.\" I leaned over and punched the \"s top\" button on my recorder. I couldn't think of a better segue to my next interview. Now that Craig had made a powerful case for God as Creator of the universe, it was time to consider the laws and paramete rs of physics. Is there any credibility, I wondered, to the claim that they have been tuned to an incomprehensible precision in order to create a livable habitat for humankind?

Physicist Paul Davies Would it not be strange if a universe without purpose acci dentally created humans who are so obsessed with purpose? Sir John Templeton.

With his mind opened by the facts, he ended up she dding his atheism and embracing God, eventually writing a book that recounted his intellectual journey to faith. If that sounds like my story, it is 3 -but, coincidentally, it's also the story of Patrick Glynn, a former arms-control negotiator for the Reagan admi nistration and currently the associate director of the George Washington University Institute for Communitarian Policy Studies in Washington, D.C. Glynn first encountered evolutionary theory while a student in parochial school, immediately recognizing that it was incompatib le with the Bible. \"I stood up in class and told the poor nun as much,\" he recalled. Convinced that reason was \"the only path to truth,\" Glynn became a confirmed atheist by the time he received his doctorate from Harvard Un iversity in the 1970s. \"Darwin had demonstrated that it was not even necessary to posit a God to e xplain the origin of life,\" he said. \"Life, and the human species itself, was the outcome of essentially random mechanisms operating over the eons.\" After marrying a Christian and finding himself in frequent debates with her over spiritual matters, Glynn said his mind \"became sufficiently ope n\" so that he was willing to check out whether there was any rational ev idence for the existence of God. He was hardly prepared for what he would learn: Gradually, I realized that in the twenty year s since I opted for philo sophical atheism, a"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"vast, systematic literature had emerged th at not only cast deep doubt on, but also, from any reasonable perspective, effectively refuted my atheistic outlook.... Today, it seems to me, there is no good reason for an intelligent person to embrace the illusion of atheism or agnosticism, to make the same intellectual mistakes I made. 4 What evidence was responsible for this stunning spiritual turnaround? Among the most influential discoveries he en countered in his investigation was the so-called \"anthropic principle.\" The term, derived from the Greek word anthropos for \"man,\" was coined by Cam- bridge physicist Brandon Carter, who delivered a ground-breaking paper called \"Large Number Coincidences and the Anthropic Principle in Cosmology\" at a prestigious scien tific conference in 1973. The principle, as Glynn learned, essentially says that \"all the seemingly arbitrary and unrelated constants in physics ha ve one strange thing in common- these are precisely the values you need if you want to have a uni verse capable of producing life. In his subsequent book God: The Evidence, Glynn credits the absolute ly incredible fine- tuning of the cosmos as being among the key re asons why he concluded that the universe must have been the handiwork of a master designer. \"As recently as twenty-five ye ars ago, a reasonable person weighing the purely scientific evidence on the issue would likel y have come down on the side of skepticism. That is no longer the case,\" he said. \"Today the conc rete data point strongly in the direction of the God hypothesis. It is the simplest and most obvious solution to the anthropic puzzle.\" THE PRIMA FACIE EVIDENCE Alister McGrath, the erudite th eologian who studied molecula r biophysics at Oxford and wrote the ambitious three-volume series A Scientific Theology, has a penchant for penetrating to the core of complex issues. In the case of the anthropic principle, he managed to summarize the essential challenge in two succinct questions , which he posed with a dash of British understatement: \"Is it a pure coincidence that the la ws of nature are such that life is possible? Might this not be an important clue to the nature and destiny of humanity?\"' Those two questions formed my roadmap as I sought fresh answers concerning how and why physics so precariously balances life on a razor's edge. I already knew that an increasing number of scientists and philosophers ha ve been following the clues to th eir own conclusions in recent decades, including \"some who are innocent of any influence from a conventional religious agenda,\" in the words of physicis t and theologian John Polkinghorne. 8 \"It is quite easy to understand why so many scie ntists have changed their minds in the past thirty years, agreeing that the universe cannot reasonably be expl ained as a cosmic accident,\" said Walter Bradley, coauthor of The Mystery of Life's Origin. \"Evidence for an intelligent designer becomes more compelling the more we u nderstand about our carefu lly crafted habitat.\" For instance, the once-skeptical Paul Davies, th e former professor of theoretical physics at the University of Adelaide, is now convinced th at there must be a purpo se behind the universe. \"Through my scientific work I have come to believe more and more strongly that the physical universe is put together with an ingenuity so astonishing that I cannot accept it merely as a brute fact,\" he said in his book The Mind of God. \"I cannot believe that our existence in this universe is a mere quirk of fate, an accident of history, an incidental bl ip in the great cosmic drama. \"10 Saying that \"many scientists, when they admit th eir views, incline toward the teleological or design argument,\" cosmologist Edward Harrison has come to this conclusion: \"The fine tuning"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"of the universe provides prima facie evidence of deistic design.\" The eminent astrophysicist Sir Fred Hoyle put it this way: \"I do not believe that any scientists who examined the evidence would fail to draw the inference that the laws of nuclear physics have been deliberately de signed with regard to the cons equences they produce inside stars.\" 12 That observation, and others like it from Ho yle, prompted Harvard astronomy professor Owen Gingerich, senior astronomer at the Smith sonian Astrophysical Observatory, to comment: \"Fred Hoyle and I differ on lots of questions, but on this we agree: a common sense and satisfying interpretation of our world suggest s the designing hand of a superintelligence.\" 13 Oxford-educated John Leslie, who catalogues many anthropic examples in his eye-opening 1989 book Universes, said he believes that if ours is the only universe-and ther e are no scientific data proving any others exist-th en the fine tuning is \"genuine evidence ... that God is real.\" In their book The New Story of Science, Robert Augros and George Stanciu sum up the inferences of the amazing confluence of \"coinciden ces\" that make life possible in the cosmos. \"A universe aiming at the production of man implies a mind directing it,\" they said. \"Though man is not at the physical center of the universe, he appears to be at th e center of its purpose.\" 15 Those conclusions aside, I was looking for my own personal answers to the fundamental questions posed by McGrath. I wanted not only to explore the scientific evidence for the universe's precarious balancing act, but I also wa nted to see if the anthropic principle could survive the challenge of a hypothesis which, accordi ng to some skeptics, ma y very well render it obsolete. While studying the fine-tuning issue, I came across the writi ngs of an articulate, physics- trained philosopher who has done his own original research on the issue. I especially liked his reputation-he was known as being careful and conser vative in his calculations, unwilling to make judgments that exceed the bounds of the data . In short, just what I was looking for. A few phone calls later, I was on a plane for Pennsylvania and a picturesque campus of redbrick buildings situated not far north of the Civil War battlefield of Gettysburg. INTERVIEW #4: ROBIN COLLINS, PHD As a seventh-grade student, Robin Collins se nt away for several free booklets from the Atomic Energy Commission-and a love for physic s was born. He went on to earn degrees in physics and mathematics at Washington State Univer sity (with a grade poin t average a scant 0.07 points shy of perfection) and then entered a doctoral program in physics at the University of Texas in Austin. His other love was philosophy-in fact, it was hi s third major in college. This expertise came in handy while working on his doctorate in an offi ce he shared with a group of graduate students that included an atheist and an agnostic. As for Collins, he had been a Christian since his last year of high school. The four of them ended up spar ring late into the night about philos ophical and theological issues, which Collins found so stimulating that he decided to pursue a doctorate in philosophy at the University of Notre Dame. The legendary Alvin Plantinga, perhaps the best American philosopher of modern times, supervised Collins's dissertation. It was a stray comment by Plantinga in class one day that first exposed Collins to the issue of the fine-tuning of the universe. Captivated by the concept, Collins delved deeply into the subject and soon found a perfect wedding between hi s expertise in physics and philosophy. Not only did his training in phys ics equip him to understand the often-complex mathematical"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"equations in the field-sometimes prompting him to politely correct the errors of more famous scholarsbut his experience in phi losophy aided him in formulating rigorous arguments from the evidence. Now, after years of research and analys is, he has emerged as one of the most informed and persuasive voices on the anthropic principle. Collins has written about the t opic for numerous books, including God and Design: The Teleological Argument and Modern Science; The Rationality of Theism; God Matters: Readings in the Philosophy of Religion; Philosophy of Religion: A Reader and Guide; and Reason for the Hope Within. Funded by a grant from the Pew Foundation, he's currently completing a book titled The Well-Tempered Universe: God, Fi ne-Tuning, and the Laws of Nature. In addition, he has spoken at numerous symposia and conferences at Yale, Concordia, Baylor, Stanford, and elsewhere, including a plenary address at the 2003 RussianU.S. conference on God and Physical Cosmology held at Notre Dame. After serving as a postdoctoral fellow at Northw estern University, Collins has spent the last decade doing research, writing, and teaching at Messiah College, where he is currently an associate professor of philosophy. That's wher e I connected with him on a warm Saturday afternoon. Collins's office was so utterly dominated by stac ks and shelves and piles and boxes and heaps of books that there was nowhere for us to sit, so we commandeered a conference room nearby. The room wa s awash in the afternoon sun, which streamed through a large window and created dancing pools of light on the carpet. Collins removed his green sports coat and tossed it over a chair as we got ready to begin. He has curly, rusty-colored hair and a beard, and the lean physique of a runner (he jogs nearly ninety minutes a day for exercise and meditation). We sat across a plain table from each other, Collins sipping from a mug of his favorit e beverage: a concoction of half black and half green tea. I was anxious to begin. Collins once said that the facts concerning the universe's remarkable \"just-so\" conditions are widely re garded as \"by far the most pers uasive current argument for the existence of God\" 16 -a statement that set a high standard. I pulled out my notebook and started by asking him to give me an overview of what the fine-tuning of the cosmos was all about. THE IMPRESSION OF DESIGN \"When scientists talk about the fine-tuning of the universe,\" Co llins said, \"they're generally referring to the extraordinary ba lancing of the fundamental laws and parameters of physics and the initial conditions of the unive rse. Our minds can't comprehend the precision of some of them. The result is a universe that has just the right conditions to sustain life. The coincidences are simply too amazing to have been the result of happenstance-as Paul Davies said, `the impression of design is overwhelming.\"' \"I like to use the analogy of astronauts landi ng on Mars and finding an enclosed biosphere, sort of like the domed structure that was built in Arizona a few years ago. At the control panel they find that all the dials for its environment are set just ri ght for life. The oxygen ratio is perfect; the temperature is seve nty degrees; the humidity is fifty percent; there's a system for replenishing the air; there are systems for producing food, generating en ergy, and disposing of wastes. Each dial has a huge range of possible settings, and you can see if you were to adjust one or more of them just a little bit, the envi ronment would go out of whack and life would be impossible. What conclusion would you draw from that?\" The answer was obvious. \"That someone took great care in designing a nd building it,\" I said. \"That's right,\" he replied. \"You'd conclude th at this biosphere was not there by accident."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Volcanoes didn't erupt and spew out the right compounds that just happened to assemble themselves into the biosphere. Some intelligen t being had intentionally and carefully designed and prepared it to support living creatures. And that's an analogy for our universe. \"Over the past thirty ye ars or so, scientists have discovered that just about everything about the basic structure of the universe is balanced on a razor's edge for life to exist. The coincidences are far too fantastic to attribute this to mere chance or to claim that it needs no e xplanation. The dials are set too precisely to have been a random accident. Somebody, as Fred Hoyle quipped, has been monkeying with the physics.\" This has to be among the most fascinating scie ntific discoveries of the century. \"Who first noticed this?\" I asked. \"Way back in the late 1950s, Hoyle talked about the precise process by which carbon and oxygen are produced in a certain ratio inside stars. If you tinker with the resonance states of carbon, you won't get the materials you need for build ing life. Incidentally, recent studies by the physicist Heinz Oberhummer and his colleagues show that just a one-percent change in the strong nuclear force would have a thirty- to a thousand-fold im pact on the production of oxygen and carbon in stars. Since stars provide the carb on and oxygen needed for life on planets, if you throw that off balance, conditions in the univers e would be much less optimal for the existence of life. \"Anyway-back to your question-most of the res earch and writing about the fine-tuning has taken place since the early 1980s. There have been hundreds of ar ticles and books written on it from both a technical an d popular perspective.\" Physics can get very complicated very quickly. So when I asked Collins to describe one of his favorite examples, I was relieved that he chose one that's among the easier to envision. \"Let's talk about gravity,\" he said. \"Imagine a ruler, or one of those old-fashioned linear radio dials, that goes all the way across the univers e. It would be broken down into one-inch increments, which means there would be bil lions upon billions upon billions of inches. \"The entire dial represents th e range of force strengths in nature, with gravity being the weakest force and the strong nuclear force that bi nds protons and neutrons together in the nuclei being the strongest, a whopping ten thousand billion billion billi on billion times stronger than gravity. 19 The range of possible settings for the force of gravity can pl ausibly be taken to be at least as large as the total range of force strengths. \"Now, let's imagine that you want to move the di al from where it's currently set. Even if you were to move it by only one inch, the impact on life in the universe would be catastrophic.\" \"One inch compared to the whole universe?\" I asked. \"What kind of impa ct could that have?\" \"That small adjustment of the dial would increase gravity by a billion-fold,\" he said. \"Whoa!\" I said. \"That sounds like a lot.\" \"Actually, it's not,\" he replied, \"R elative to the entire radio di al-that is, the total range of force strengths in nature-it's extraordinarily sma ll, just one part in ten thousand billion billion billion.\" \"Wow, that puts it into perspective,\" I said. \"What would happen to life?\" \"Animals anywhere near the size of human beings would be crushed,\" he said. \"As astrophysicist Martin Rees said, `In an imaginary strong gravity world, even insects would need thick legs to support them, and no animals could get much larger.' 20 In fact, a planet with a gravitational pull of a thousand times that of the Earth would have a diameter of only forty feet, which wouldn't be enough to sustain an ecosystem. Besides which, stars with lifetimes of more than a billion years-compared to ten billion y ears for our sun-couldn't exist if you increase"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"gravity by just three thousand times. \"As you can see, compared to th e total range of force strengths in nature, gravity has an incomprehensibly narrow range for life to exist. Of all the possible settings on the dial, from one side of the universe to the other, it happens to be situated in the exact right fraction of an inch to make our universe capable of sustaining life.\" And gravity is just one parameter that scientists have studied. One expert said there are more than thirty separate physical or cosmological para meters that require precise calibration in order to produce a life-sustaining universe. 21 As for Collins, he likes to focus on gravity a nd a handful of other examples that he has personally investigated and which he believes are sufficient by themselves to establish the case for a designer. I decided to ask Collins about another parameter-the so-called \"cosmological constant\" - a phenomenon so bewildering th at it even boggles the mind of one of the world's most skeptical scientists. THROWING DARTS AT AN ATOM Nobel-winning physicist Steven Weinberg, an av owed atheist, has expressed amazement at the way the cosmological constant-the energy density of empty space-is \"remarkably well adjusted in our favor.\" 22 The constant, which is part of Einstein's equation for General Relativity, could have had any value, positiv e or negative, \"but from first principles one would guess that this constant should be very large,\" Weinberg said. Fortunately, he added, it isn't: If large and positive, the cosmological cons tant would act as a repulsive force that increases with distance, a force that would prevent matter from clumping together in the early universe, the process that was the first st ep in forming galaxies and stars and planets and people. If large and nega tive, the cosmological constant would act as an attractive force increasing with distance, a force th at would almost immediately reverse the expansion of the universe and cause it to recollapse. 23 Either way, life loses-big time. But ast onishingly, that's not what has happened. \"In fact,\" Weinberg said, \"astronomical observations show that the cosmological constant is quite small, very much smaller than woul d have been guessed from first principles.\" 24 When I asked Collins about this, he told me that the unexpected, counterintuitive, and stunningly precise setting of the co smological constant \"is widely re garded as the single greatest problem facing physics and cosmology today.\" \"How precise is it?\" I asked. Collins rolled his eyes. \"Well, there's no way we can really comprehend it,\" he said. \"The fine-tuning has conservatively been estimated to be at least one pa rt in a hundred million billion billion billion billion billion. That would be a ten followed by fifty-three zeroes. That's inconceivably precise.\" He was right-I couldn't imagine a figure like that. \"Can you give me an illustration?\" I asked. \"Put it this way,\" he said. \"Let's say you we re way out in space and were going to throw a dart at random toward the Earth. It would be like successfully hitting a bull's eye that's one trillionth of a trillionth of an in ch in diameter. That's less than the size of one solitary atom.\" Breathtaking was the word that came into my mind. Staggering. \"No wonder scientists have been blown away by this,\" I said. \"I'll tell you what,\" Collins said, \"in my opinion , if the cosmological constant were the only example of fine-tuning, and if there were no na tural explanation for it, then this would be"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"sufficient by itself to strongly establish design.\" I had to agree. The way I saw it, if the universe were put on trial for a char ge of having been designed, and the fine-tuning of the cosmological constant were the only evidence introduced by the prosecution, I would have to vote \"gui lty\"-assuming there was no hidden naturalistic explanation. Statistically , this would be a far stronger case than even the DNA evidence that is used to establish guilt in many criminal trials today. Collins continued. \"Now, think about adding together the evidence for just the two factors I've discussed so far-the cosmological constant and the force of gravity,\" he said. \"This would create an unimaginably stronge r case. When you combine the tw o, the fine-tuning would be to a precision of one part in a hundred million trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion. That would be the equivalent of one at om in the entire known universe!\" And Collins wasn't through. \"There are other examples of fine-tuning,\" he said. \"For instance, there's the difference in mass between neutrons and protons. Increase th e mass of the neutron by about one part in seven hundred and nuclear fu sion in stars would stop. There would be no energy source for life. \"And if the electromagnetic force were slightly stronger or weaker , life in the universe would be impossible. Or consider the strong nuclear fo rce. Imagine decreasing it by fifty percent, which is tinyone part in ten thousand bi llion billion billion billion, compar ed to the total range of force strengths.\" \"What would happen if you tinke red with it by that amount?\" \"Since like charges repel, the strong nuclear for ce would be too weak to prevent the repulsive force between the positively charge d protons in atomic nuclei from tearing apart all atoms except hydrogen,\" he said. \"And regardle ss of what they may show on Star Trek you can't have intelligent life forms built from hydrogen. It simp ly doesn't have enough stable complexity.\" I knew Collins could go on and on, but I needed a way to visualize the implications of these increasingly abstract concepts. \"Go back to your Martia n biosphere illustration,\" I said. \"Okay,\" he replied. \"Set aside th e issue of how the biosphere got there in the first place. Let's say when you found it, there were twelve dials th at controlled the conditions inside the dome. Each dial had an incredibly huge range of po ssible settings. When you departed, you left the dials at random and as a result no life was possible in the biosphere. \"Then you come back a year later. When you look at the dials, you're amazed to find that each one of them has been carefully cali brated to just the right setting so that life is flourishing in the dome. Twelve dials, twelve different factors-all optimally set for life. \"Do you know what the headline would be in the newspaper th e next day? It would say: EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE EXISTS. We would take that as proof that an intelligent being had landed and set those dials precisely where they needed to be for life. \"And I'm saying that the dials for the fundamental properties of the univ erse have been set like that. In fact, the precision is far greater. This would be totally unexpected under the theory that random chance was responsible. However, it's not unexpected at all under the hypothesis that there is a Grand Designer.\" READY, AIM, FIRE! Few concepts stretch the mind as much as the fine-tuning of the universe. For example, Oxford physicist Roger Penrose sa id one parameter, the \"origina l phase-space volume,\" required fine-tuning to an accuracy of one part in ten billion multiplied by itself one hundred and twenty three times. Penrose remarked th at it would be impossible to ev en write down that number in"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"full, since it would require more zeroes than the number of elementary pa rticles in the entire universe! This showed, he sa id, \"the precision needed to set the universe on its course.\" 25 As Discover magazine marveled: \"The universe is unlikely. Very unlikely. Deeply, shockingly unlikely.\" 26 In light of the infinitesimal odds of getting all the right dial settings for the constants of physics, the forces of nature, a nd other physical laws and principles necessary for life, it seems fruitless to try to explain away all of this fine-tuning as merely the product of random happenstance. \"As long as we're talking about probabilities, then theoretically you can't rule out the possibility-however remote-that this could occur by chance,\" Collins said. \"However, if I bet you a thousand dollars that I c ould flip a coin and get heads fifty times in a row, and then I proceeded to do it, you wouldn't accept that. You'd know that the odds against that are so improbable-about one chance in a million billion-that it's extraordinarily unlikely to happen. The fact that I was able to do it against such monumental odds w ould be strong evidence to you that the game had been rigged. And the same is true for the fine-tuning of the universe- before you'd conclude that random chance was responsible, you'd conclude that there is strong evidence that the universe was rigged. That is, designed. \"I'll give you another illustrati on,\" he continued. \"Let's say I was hiking in the mountains and came across rocks arranged in a pattern that spelled out, WELCOME TO THE MOUNTAINS ROBIN COLLINS. One hypothesi s would be that the rocks just happened to be arranged in that configuration, maybe as the result of an earthquake or rockslide. You can't totally rule that out. But an alternative hypothesis would be that my brother, who was visiting the mountains before me, arranged the rocks that way. \"Quite naturally, most people would accept the brother theory over the chance theory. Why? Because it strikes us as supremely improbable that the rocks would be arranged that way by chance, but not at all improbable th at my brother would place them in that pattern. That's a quite reasonable assumption. \"In a similar way, it's supremely improbable that the fine-tuning of the universe could have occurred at random, but it's not at all improbable if it were the work of an intelligent designer. So it's quite reasonable to choose the design theory over the chance theory. We reason that way all the time. Were the defendant's fingerprints on the gun because of a chance formation of chemicals or because he touched the weapon? Juro rs don't hesitate to confidently conclude that he touched the gun if the odds agai nst chance are so astronomical.\" While random chance was insufficient to explain away the anthropic \"coincidences,\" perhaps there were other alternatives to the conclusion th at the universe was the handiwork of a designer. It was time to put some of those to the test. \"What if there's some undiscovered principle th at makes the universe the way it is?\" I asked. \"Maybe the elusive Theory of Ev erything that physicists have been seeking for so long will turn out to require the parameters of physics to have exactly th e values they do.\" Collins was unperturbed by the idea. \"It wouldn't bother me a bit,\" he replied. \"It simply moves the improbability of the fine-tuning up one level.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"It would really be amazing if this Grand Unif ied Theory-out of the incredible range of possibilities-managed to force all the finetuning dials to where th ey just happened to create a life-sustaining universe,\" he said. \"It would be like some predetermined law at the outset of the universe caused everything to fall into place so that when I came to the mountain, I saw a pattern"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"of rocks spelling out WELCOME TO THE MOUNTAINS ROBIN COLLINS.\" \"So,\" I said, \"this wouldn't destroy the argument for intelligent design?\" \"Quite the opposite,\" he replie d. \"It would amplify it, because it would show that the designer was even more ingenious than we first thought. As difficult as it woul d be to fine-tune the universe by adjusting all of the individual dials, it would be even more difficult to create an underlying law of nature that then forced all the dials into those specific positions. All that would do would be to make me even more in awe of the Creator.\" Some skeptics have attacked the fine-tuning ar gument from another direction, raising what has become known as the Weak Anthropic Principle. According to this idea, if the universe were not fine-tuned for life, then human beings wouldn't be around to observe it. Consequently, they contend that the fine-tuni ng requires no explanation. \"You have to admit, there's a certain intui tive appeal to that,\" I said to Collins. \"I think John Leslie had the best answer to that,\" he replied. \"Suppose you were standing before a firing squad of fifty highly trained marksmen who were al l aiming directly at your chest from a short distance away. You heard the or der, `Ready! Aim! Fire!' But you didn't feel anything. You remove your blindfold and see you're still very much alive. Not one bullet hit you. \"Now, you wouldn't allow the skeptic to simply dismiss the situation by saying, `Oh well, if they had shot you, you wouldn't be here to comment on the situation.' No-the circumstances are still Surprising and they would still demand an explanation. Did they conspire together to miss you ? Was this a mock execution? And the sam e thing is true for the fine-tuning of the uni verse. It still demands an explanation. My assessment is that the best explanation is a designer.\" Despite Collins's confidence, however, a more serious threat to the fine-tuning argument has been raised by some scientists in recent years. Many scientists would say that the so-called \"many-universe s hypothesis\" looms as the most formidable challenge to the conclusion that the universe was crafted with artful precision by a tr anscendent designer. That, I decided, would be my next line of questioning. THE METAPHYSICAL ESCAPE HATCH Spiritual skeptic Martin Rees, who became a pr ofessor of astronomy at Cambridge when he was in his thirties and was named Astronomer Royal by Queen Elizabeth in 1995, could not ignore how the cosmic parameters are so incred ibly choreographed to create a life-friendly universe. If the six numbers that underlie the fundamental physical properties of the universe were altered \"even to the tiniest degree,\" he said, \"there would be no stars, no complex ele ments, no life.\" 27 Declared Rees: \"The expansion speed, the materi al content of the unive rse, and the strengths of the basic forces, seem to have been a prere quisite for the emergence of the hospitable cosmic habitat in which we live.\" 28 One author nicely encapsulated this example from Rees: For the universe to exist as it does requires that hydrogen be converted to helium in a precise but comparatively stat ely manner-specifically, in a way that converts seven one- thousandths of its mass to energy. Lower that value very slightly -from 0.007 percent to 0.006 percent, say-and no transformation could take place: the universe would consist of hydrogen and nothing else. Raise the value ve ry slightly-to 0.008 percent-and bonding would be so wildly prolific that the hydroge n would long since have been exhausted. In"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"either case, with the slightest tweaking of the numbers the universe as we know and need it would not be here. 29 When the other five numbers that represent \"the deep forces that shape the universe\" are taken into considerat ion, said Rees, the uni v erse's structure becomes \"unlikely to an absurd degree.\" 30 Still, is Rees surprised by the universe's exqui sitely precarious balancing act? No. Does he believe the fine-tuning points to a designer? Not at all. Why? He answers by using the illustration of a large off-the-rack clothing store. \"If there is a large stack of cl othing, you're not surprised to find a suit that fits,\" he said. \"If there are many universes, each governed by a differ ent set of numbers, there will be one where there is a particular set of numbers suitable to life. We are in that one.” The argument can be summarized this way: \"There could have been millions and millions of different universes, each created with different dial settings of the fundamental ratios and constants, so many in fact that the right se t was bound to turn up by sheer chance. We just happened to be the lucky ones.\" 32 In other words, if ours is th e only universe in existence, th en the fine-tuning is powerful- many would say, conclusive-evidence that an in telligence had tinkered with the dials. There seems to be no other reasonable possibility. But th at conclusion evaporates if there are many or an infinite number of universes. With enough random dial spinning, the odds are that at least one-our own-would win the cosmic lo ttery and be a livable habitat. Rees is not the only skeptic to escape the theist ic implications of the finely tuned universe by speculating about the existe nce of other worlds. In fact, that 's exactly the approach Weinberg took after expressing amazement at the une xpected precariousness of the cosmological constant. 33 Many physicists subscribe to some sort of multiple universe, or \"multiverse,\" theory, although others scoff at the idea, charging that it's little more than a metaphysical escape hatch to avoid the fine-tuning evidence fo r a designer. Said one writer: Originally the many-worlds hypothesis was pro posed for strictly scie ntific reasons as a solution to the so-called quantum-measurement problem in physics. Though its efficacy as an explanation within quantum physics remains controversial among physicists, its use there does have an empirical basis. More recently, however, it has been employed to serve as an alternate non-theis tic explanation for the fine-tuni ng of the physical constants. This use of the [hypothesis] does seem to betray a metaphysical desperation . 34 \"It's purely a concept, an idea, without scien tific proof,\" William Lane Craig, coauthor of Theism, Atheism and Big Bang Cosmology, told me in an interview. \"Look-this is pure metaphysics. 3 ' There's no real reason to believe such pa rallel worlds exist. The very fact that skeptics have to come up with such an outla ndish theory is because the fine-tuning of the universe points powerfully toward an intelligent designer-and some people will hypothesize anything to avoid reaching that conclusion.\" 36 Similarly, Cambridge's Polkinghorne, a former pr ofessor of mathematical physics, has called the hypothesis \"pseudo-science\" and \"a metaphysical guess.\" 37 He put it this way in his book Science and Theology: \"The many universes account is sometim es presented as if it were purely scientific, but in fact a sufficient portfolio of different universes could only be generated by speculative processes that go well beyond wh at sober science can honestly endorse.\" 38 Davies has concluded that \"the many-universes theory can at best explain only a limited"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"range of features, and then only if one appends some metaphysica l assumptions that seem no less extravagant than design.\" 39 Observed Clifford Longley: \"The sigh t of scientific atheists clutching at such desperate straws has put ne w spring in the step of theists.\" 40 Rees conceded the tenuous nature of the multiv erse theory in a 2000 interview with a science journalist. Rees admitted the calculations are \"highly arbitrary\" (though he suggests someday they might not be), and that the theory itself \"h angs on assumptions,\" rema ins speculative, and is not amenable to direct investigation. \"The othe r universes are unavailable to us, just as the interior of a black hole is unava ilable,\" he said. He added that we cannot even know if the uni- verses are finite or infinite in number. Even so, he said the multiverse theory \"genuinely lies within the province of science.\" 41 All of this was swirling in my mind as I prepar ed to question Collins on the possibility that a multi-universe scenario could extinguish the evidence for a designer of our universe. I was genuinely curious: Can the hypothesi s provide a reasonable refuge for skeptics who balk at the idea of God? Or would the anthropi c argument withstand the challenge? THE COSMIC HOCKEY PUCK I have to admit that I was ta ken aback by Collins's initial resp onse when I asked him about the viability of the many-universes hypothesis. \"Well,\" he said, taking a sip of tea and putting the mug on the table, \"most of these hypotheses are entirely speculative and have little basis in physics. They're not worth considering. However, the most po pular theory, inflationary cosmology, has more credibility. I have to say that I'm at least sympathetic to it. I'm trying to keep an open mind.\" Collins was referring to the \"self-reproducing inflationary universe\" model proposed by Andre Linde of Stanford University, which is ba sed on advanced principles of quantum physics. This was the theory that Weinberg cited when he tried to explain away the apparent fine-tuning of the cosmological constant. In a stunning example of understate ment, one science writer said that Linde's concept \"defies easy visualization.\" 42 However, at the risk of too much simplicity, a basic illustration can be used. Linde postulates a preexisting superspace that is rapidly expanding. A small part of this superspace is blown up by a theoretical inflaton field, sort of like soap bubbles forming in an infinite ocean full of dish detergent. Each bubble becomes a new universe. In what's known as \"chaotic inflation theory,\" a hug e number of such universes ar e randomly birthed, thanks to quantum fluctuations, along vari ous points of superspace. Thus , each universe has a beginning and is finite in size, while the much larger supe rspace is infinite in size and endures forever. I mentioned to Collins that in an earlie r interview on cosmology, William Lane Craig had little use for this kind of theory. \"Granted, it's highly speculative,\" Collins said. \"There are an awful lot of loose ends with it. But since it's by far the most popular theory today-and I believe it should be taken seriously-let's not critique it ri ght now. Let's just make the assumption that it's true.\" \"All right,\" I said, nodding. \"That's fine.\" \"Now, here's my overarching point: even if Linde's theory could account for the existence of many universes, this would not destroy the case for design. It would just kick the issue up another level. In fact, I believe it would point toward design.\" That was an interesting twist! \"Why do you believe that?\" I asked. \"I'll use an everyday example,\" he said. \"My wife and I have a bread-making machine. Actually, it's defunct now, but we used to use it. To make edible bread, we first needed this well-"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"designed machin e that had the right circuitry, the right heating elem ent, the right timer, and so forth. Then we had to put in the right ingredient s in the right proportions and in the right order- water, milk, flour, shortening, salt, sugar, yeast. The flour had to have the right amount of a protein substance called gluten, or else it would need to be added. 43 Everythin g has to be just right to produce a loaf of bread-otherwise, you get what l ooks like a burnt hockey puck. \"Now, let's face it: a universe is far more complex than a loaf of bread. My point is that if a bread machine requires certain specific parameters to be set in order to create bread, then there has to be a highly designed mechanism or pro cess to produce functional universes. In other words, regardless of which multiple-universe theo ry you use, in every case you'd need a 'many- universes generator'-and it would re quire the right structure, the right mechanism, and the right ingredients to chur n out new universes. \"Otherwise,\" he said, stifling a chuckle, \"you'd end up with a cosmic hockey puck!\" THE MANY-UNIVERSE MACHINE Collins pushed back his chair and walked over to a chalkboard on the wall. \"My students get a kick out of it when I draw a `many universes generator, \"' he said, sketching a whimsical cartoon of a manufacturing machine, complete with a billowing smokestack and a conveyor belt that brought in raw materials a nd then carried freshly minted universes out the other side. \"This machine,\" he said, putting the finishi ng touches on his artwork, \"can only produce life- sustaining universes if it has the right components and mechanisms.\" I leaned back and scrutini zed his drawing. \"What would you need, say, under Linde's theory?\" I asked. \"First,\" Collins said as he strolled back to his chair, \"you'd need a mechanism to supply the energy needed for the bubble universes. That would be the inflaton field that he has hypothesized, which effectively acts like a re servoir of unlimited energy. Second, he would need a mechanism to form the bubbles. This would be Einstein's equation of general relativity. Because of its peculiar form, this would supposedly cause the bubble universes to form and the ocean to keep expanding. \"Third, he would need a mechanism to convert the energy of the inflaton field to the normal mass/energy that we find in our universe. F o urth, he would need a mechanism to allow enough variation in the constants of physics among the vari ous universes. In other words, he would need a way to vary the constants of physics so that by random chance he would produce some universes, like ours, that have the ri ght fine-tuning to sustain life.\" \"Is there a candidate for that mechanism?\" I asked. \"Well, yes-superstring theory,\" he replied. \"This might work, t hough it's far too early to tell.\" When I asked why he brought up superstrings, he explained: \"According to superstring theory, the ultimate constituents of matter are strings of energy that undergo quantum vibrations in ten or eleven dimensions of space-time. Six or seven of these dimensions are `rolled up' to an extremely small size. In the jargon of string theory, they are said to be compactified. Their shape determines the modes of vibration of the strings . This, in turn, would determine the types and masses of fundamental particles and the characteristics of the forces between them. So they would have different constants of ph ysics and laws governing the forces.\" \"That sounds pretty iffy,\" I said. \"Well, both inflationary cosmol ogy and superstring theory are highly speculative. In fact, theoretical physicist Michio Kaku said recently th at `not a shred of experimental evidence' has been found to confirm superstrings. 44 Physicists are a long way from even working out the"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"equations. Right now it's just a theory whose main merits are that it's mathematically elegant and that it holds the promise of unifying quantum m echanics and general rela tivity, two branches of physics that physicists have struggled to reconcile for over fifty years.\" I summed up what Collins had said so far. \"So the many-universes generator would need all these factors if it ever hoped to produce a functioning universe,\" I said. \"Right,\" he replied. \"F or example, without Einstein's e quation and the infl aton field working together harmoniously, it wouldn't work. If the universe obeyed Newton's theory of gravity instead of Einstein's, it wouldn't work. But that's not all. \"You would also have to have the right background laws in place. For instance, without the so-called principle of quantization, all of the electrons in an atom would be sucked into the atomic nuclei. That w ould make atoms impossible. Further, as eminent Princeton physicist Freeman Dyson has note d, without the Pauli-exclusion principl e, electrons would occupy the lowest orbit around the nucle us, and that would make complex atoms impossible. 45 Finally, without a universally attractive force between all masses-such as gravity- stars and planets couldn't form. If just one of these components was missing or different, it's highly improbable that any life-perm itting universes could be produced. \"And keep in mind,\" he added, \"you would need to make trillions upon trillions upon trillions upon trillions of universes in order to increase the odds that th e cosmological constant would come out right at least once, since it's fi nely tuned to an incomprehensible degree. And that's just one parameter.\" \"What's your conclusion then?\" I asked. \"It's highly unlikely that such a universe-generating system would have all the right components and ingredients in pl ace by random chance, just like random chance can't account for how a bread-maker produces loaves of edible bread. So if a many-universe-generating system exists, it would be best explained by design.\" \"That means,\" I said, \"that when scientists appeal to the theoreti cal existence of many universes to avoid the implications of the finetuning of our unive rse, they still can't escape design.\" \"Exactly,\" he declared. \"Theists have nothing to fear from the idea that there may be multiple universes. There would still need to be an intelligent designer to make the finely tuned universe- generating process work. To modify a phrase from philosopher Fred Dretske: these are inflationary times, and the cost of atheism has just gone up.\" THE SUPERMIND I thought for a few moments about Collins's e xplanation. Certainly it made sense that generating universes would require the right mechanisms, the right ingredients, and the right precision-all earmarks of intellig ent design. But I was still menta lly wrestling with something else. To me-admittedly, not a physicist-the whole concept of multiple universes seemed absurd. I found myself agreeing with the iconoclastic Gregg Easterbrook, a contributing editor for the Atlantic Monthly, who researched the discoveries and th eories of modern science. He was characteristically blunt in his assessment. \"The multiverse idea rests on assumptions that would be laughed out of town if they came from a religi ous text,\" he wrote. \"[The theory] requires as much suspension of disbelief as any religion. Join the church that believes in the existence of invisible objects fifty billion galaxies wide!\" 46 When I mentioned my skepticism to Collins, he listened carefully. \"There's a reason you feel that way,\" he said. \"You see, ev erything else being equal, we te nd to prefer hypotheses that are"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"natural extrapolations of what we already know.\" I wasn't sure what he was driving at. \"Could you give me an illustration of that?\" I asked. \"Sure,\" he said. \"Let's say you found some di nosaur bones. You would naturally consider them to be very strong eviden ce that dinosaurs lived in the past. Why? Because even though nobody has ever seen dinosaurs, we do have the experience of other animals leaving behind fossilized remains. So the dinosaur explanatio n is a natural extrapolation from our common experience. It makes sense. \"Let's say there was a dinosaur skeptic, howev er. He was trying to ra tionalize away the bones you found. Let's suppose he claimed he could e xplain the bones by proposing that a'dinosaur- bone-producing field' simply caused them to materialize out of thin air.\" \"That's ridiculous,\" I said. \"And that's exactly what you would tell the skep tic,\" Collins continued. \"You'd say: `Wait a second-there are no known laws of physics that would allow that field to conjure up bones out of nothing.' But the skeptic would be ready for you. He'd reply, 'Aha-we just haven't discovered these laws yet. We simply haven't detected these fi elds yet. Give us more time, Lee, and I'm sure we will.' \"My guess is that nothing could deter you from inferring that dinosaurs existed, because this would be a natural extrapolation from what you already know,\" Collins concluded. \"On the other hand, the skeptic needs to invent a whole new set of physical laws and a whole new set of mechanisms that are not a natural extrapolation from anythi ng we know or have experienced. You wouldn't buy his story. No way.\" \"You're saying, then, that an intelligent designer is a natural extrapolati on of what we already know?\" \"Yes, I am,\" he replied. \"Think about it, Lee-we already know that intelligent minds produce finely tuned devices. Look at the space shuttle. L ook at a television set. Look at an internal combustion engine. We see minds producing complex, precision mach inery all the time. \"So postulating the existence of a supermind-or God-as the e xplanation for the fine-tuning of the universe makes all the sense in the world. It would simply be a natural extrapolation of what we already know that minds can do. And, what's more, unlike the hypothesis that there are many universes, we have independent evidence of God's existence, such as a personal experience of the Creator and the other sort of evidence you're talking about in your book.\" THE BEAUTY OF PHYSICS Collins took his last sip of tea at about the same time I finished my glass of water. \"Let's go get some refills,\" he said, motioning for me to follow him down the hall. Without students or faculty, th e building was eerily quiet, our voices echoing slightly as we ambled down the empty corridor. \"The day is too beautiful to be spending so much time indoors,\" I commented as we arrive d at a self-serve kitchen area. \"Yeah, perfect for a run,\" Collins said. I filled my glass with water while he blended his tea. Silence prevailed for a few moments, then Collins remarked: \"Talking about beauty reminds me of another line of reasoning that points toward a designer,\" he said. \"Really?\" I asked. \"T ell me about it.\" \"Think about the extraordinary beauty, elegance, harmony, and i ngenuity that we find in the laws of nature,\" he replied as we headed back to the conference room. \"Whole books have been written about it. Weinberg once spent an entire chapter explaining"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"how the criteria of beauty and elegance have been used to guide physicists in formulating the right laws.`' The theoretical physic ist Alan Guth said that the or iginal constructi on of the gauge theories of fundamental particle physics `w as motivated mainly by their mathematical elegance.' 4 \"One of the most influential scientists of the twentieth century, Paul Dirac, the Nobel Prize winner from Cambridge, even clai med that `it is more important to have beauty in one's equations than to have them fit experiment.'” One historian said mathematical beauty was , an integral part' of Dirac's strategy. He said Dirac believed physicists `first had to se lect the most beautiful mathematics-not necessarily connected to the existing basis of theoretical physics-and then interpret them in physical terms.\"' \"A n d you see beauty in the laws and principles of nature?\" I asked. \"Oh. absolutely,\" he declared. \"They're beautifu l, and they're also elegant in their simplicity. Surprisingly so. When scientists are trying to construc t a new law of nature, they routinely look for the simplest law that adequately accounts for the data.\" I interrupted with an objection. \"Isn't beauty in the eye of the be holder?\" I asked. \"What's beautiful seems so subjective.\" \"Subjectivity can't explain the success of the crite rion of beauty in science,\" he replied. \"We wouldn't expect purely subjective patterns to serv e as the basis of theories that make highly accurate predictions, such as the success of qua ntum electrodynamics to predict the quantum correction to the g-f actor of the electron. \"Besides, not all beauty is subjective; there ar e also objective aspects of it, at least in the classical sense. In his book The Analysis of Beauty, written in the mid-1700s, William Hogarth said the defining feature of beauty or elegance is `simplicity with variety.' And that's what scientists have found-a world where fundamental simplicity gives rise to the enormous complexity needed for life.\" I ventured another alternative. \"Maybe the concept of beauty is merely the product of evolution,\" I said. \"Perhaps it has survival value, and so our sense of what's beautiful has been shaped by natural selection.\" \"That would only apply to things we can see, to uch, or hearthings in our everyday world that are necessary for survival. But evolution can't e xplain the beauty that ex ists in the underlying world of physical laws a nd mathematics,\" he said. \"In physics, we see an uncanny degree of ha rmony, symmetry, and proportionality. And we see something that I call 'discoverability.' By that, I mean that the laws of nature seem to have been carefully arranged so that th ey can be discovered by beings with our level of intelligence. That not only fits the idea of design, but it al so suggests a providential purpose for humankind- that is, to learn about our habitat and to develop science and technology.\" Collins mentioned that Davies had also commented about the beauty of nature in his book Superforce. Later I found the passage: A common reaction among physicists to remarkable discoveries ... is a mixture of delight at the subtlety and elegance of nature, and of stupefaction: \"I woul d never have thought of doing it that way.\" If nature is so \"cleve r\" it can exploit mechanisms that amaze us with their ingenuity, is that not persuasive evidence for the existence of intelligent design behind the physical universe? If the world's finest minds can unravel only with difficulty the deeper workings of nature , how could it be supposed that those workings are merely a mindless accident, a product of blind chan ce? ... Uncovering the laws of physics resembles completing a crossword [puzzle] in a number of ways.... In the case of the"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"crossword, it would never occur to us to suppose that the words just happened to fall into a consistent interlocki ng pattern by accident.' 1 \"Under an atheistic viewpoint,\" Collins continue d, \"there's no reason to expect that the fundamental laws would be beautiful or elegant, because they easily could have been otherwise. Even Weinberg, who's an atheist, conceded that `sometimes nature seems more beautiful than strictly necessary.' 52 \"However, the fine-tuning for si mplicity, beauty, and elegance does make sense under the God hypothesis. Think of the classical conception of God-he is the grea test possible being, and therefore a being with perfect ae sthetic sensibility. It wouldn't be surprising at all for God to want to create a world of great subtlety and beauty at its most fundamental level.\" \"ALL OTHER THEORIES FALL SHORT\" We walked back into the conference room, knowi ng that we were getting close to finishing. Collins leaned against the wall, a mug in one hand, the other arm casually folded across his chest, while I perched atop the back of a chair, my feet resting on its seat. The intersection of faith and physics was a fasc inating crossroads to me, and I was curious about the impact of Collins's research on his personal life. \"What has your study of the fine-tuning of the universe done for your faith?\" I asked. Collins put down his tea. \"Oh, it has strengthened it, absolutely,\" he replied. \"Like everybody, I've gone through some hard times in life, and all of the scien tific evidence for God has been an important anchor for me.\" That sounded like science displacing faith. \"Isn't that what faith is supposed to do?\" I asked. \"I am taking about faith,\" he insisted. \"God doesn't usually appear supernaturally somewhere and say, `Here I am.' He uses preachers to bring people his message of redemption through Christ. And sometimes he uses natural means. Ro mans 1:20 tells us that God's eternal power and divine nature can be seen and understood through thi ngs that are made, and th at this is the reason humanity is without excuse. I see physics as uncovering the evid ence of God's fingerprint at a deeper and more subtle level th an the ancients could have dreamed of. He has used physics to enable me to see the evidence of his presence an d creative ability. The heavens really do declare the glory of God, even more so for someone traine d with physics and with eyes to see. That has been a tremendous encouragement to me. \"Of course,\" he continued, \"the fine-tuning by itself can't tell us whether God is personal or not. We have to find out in other ways. But it does he lp us conclude that he exists, that he created the world, and that therefore the universe has a purpose. He made it very carefully and quite precisely as a habitat for intelligent life.\" \"How do you assess the persuasiveness of the anthropic evidence?\" I asked. \"It's not conclusive in the sense that mathematic s tells us two plus two equals four,\" he said. \"Instead, it's a cumulative argument. The extraord inary fine-tuning of the laws and constants of nature, their beauty, their discoverability, their in telligibility-all of this combines to make the God hypothesis the most reasonable choice we have. All other theories fall short.\" I picked up a newspaper clipping from the conf erence table, then said to Collins: \"The New York Times recently published that famous quote by physicist Freeman Dyson, who looked at the evidence for fine-tuning and said : `The universe in some sense must have known that we were coming.' But then the author adde d: `This notion horrifies some phys icists, who feel it is their mission to find a mathematical explanation of nature that leaves nothing to chance or the whim"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"of the Creator.' Obviously, that's not how you see the mission of physics, is it?\" 53 \"No, not at all,\" he said. \"That attitude reflects an antitheistic bias. I don't mind scientists trying to find naturalistic explanations, but I wouldn't say it's the mission of physics to explain everything naturalistically. The missi on of physics is to pursue a natu ralistic explanation as far as we can; but since physics can only explain one set of laws by invoking a more fundamental set of laws, it can never itself explain the most fundamental laws. Explai ning these laws is where one moves from physics to metaphysics. Though invoking God may not be strictly part of science, it is in the spirit of science to follow the evidence and its implications wherever they lead us. We shouldn't shrink back from the God hypothe sis if that's what the facts fit.\" He wasn't alone in that perspective. Said Ha rvard's Gingerich: \"I beli eve that ... the Book of Nature, with its astounding details-th e blade of grass, the Conus cedonulli, or the resonance levels of the carbon atom-suggests a God of pur pose and a God of design. And I think my belief makes me no less of a scientist.\" 54 With that, one last question came to mind. \"As you dig deeper and deeper into physics,\" I said to Collins, \"do you have a sense of wonder and awe at what you find?\" \"I really do,\" he said, a grin breaking on his face. \"Not just with the fi ne-tuning but in lots of areas, like quantum mechanics and the ability of our minds to understand the world. The deeper we dig, we see that God is more subtle and mo re ingenious and more creative than we ever thought possible. And I think that's the way G od created the universe for us-to be full of surprises.\" HEADS OR TAILS Whichever way I looked, the inference of desi gn seemed inescapable. If ours is the only universe in existence, which is a logical conc lusion based on the eviden ce, then its highly sophisticated fine-tuning cries out for a designer. On the other hand, if the esoter ic theories of physicists turn out to be true and our universe is one of ma ny others, then the need for a universe-generating mechanism also would demand a designer. Heads or tails, the Creator wins. As Vera Kistiakowski, professor of physics emerita at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and former president of the Associ ation of Women in Science, summarized the implications of the evidence: \"T he exquisite order displayed by our scientific understanding of the physical world calls for the divine.\" That was also the conclusion th at dissolved Patrick Glynn's atheism. The anthropic evidence, he said ... .. does offer as strong an indication as reason and science alone could be expected to provide that God exists.... Ironically, the picture of the universe bequeathed to us by the most advanced twentieth-century science is closer in spirit to the vision presented in the Book of Genesis than anything offe red by science since Copernicus. 56 So far, after the one-two punch of my interv iews with Craig and Collins, the evidence was clearly pointing in that direction. In fact, my imagina tion was captivated by one particular implication. In The Case for Christ, I described the historical evidence for the miracles of Jesus of Nazareth, especially his resurrecti on from the dead. The ability to supernaturally intervene in the normal affairs of the world, to momentarily suspe nd the natural functioni ng of the universe, is certainly powerful affirmation that he is the Son of God."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"However, having heard about the meticulous fine-tuning of the la ws of nature, I now realized that the everyday functioning of the universe is, in itself, a kind of ongoing miracle. The \"coincidences\" that allow the fundamental properties of matter to yield a habitable environment are so improbable, so far-fetched, so elegantly orchestrated, that they require a divine explanation. In other words, the momentary abrogation of the la ws of nature in a sudden, visible, and direct way-what we usually call a \"miracle\"-obviously po ints toward an all-powerful deity. Yet even if God doesn't supernaturally intervene, the otherwise inexplicable fine-tuning of physics, operating day in and day out ever since creation, also seems to warrant the term \"miraculous.\" And miracles are the province of God. I was pondering this tho ught as Collins and I emerged from the building, taking deep breaths of the fragrant autumn air and basking in the sunshine. Lo oking up, I could se e the blazing sun on one side of the blue sky and the faint moon on the other. My mind turned from the abstract world of physics to the planets and moons and stars and galaxies that populate the universe. What other evidence of fine-t uning, I wondered, might be wait ing in the cosmos? Could our very existence on a life-sustaining rock on the ou tskirts of the Milky Wa y tell us anything about the Creator who has thus far been so highly suggested by cosmology and physics? I made my decision as I drove away from th e campus: it was time to quiz an astronomer about what we can learn from the myster y and grandeur of the heavens.

Is it possible that suddenly, without intending to, we have stumbled upon scientific proof of the existence of a Supreme Being? Was it God who stepped in and so providentially crafted th e cosmos for our benefit? Astronomer George Greenstein Astronomy leads us to a unique e vent, a universe which was create d out of nothing, one with the very delicate balance needed to provide exactly the conditions required to perm it life, and one which has an underlying (one mi ght say \"supernatural\") plan. Nobel laureate Arno Penzias There's nothing unusual about Earth. It's an average, unassuming rock that's spinning mindlessly around an unremarkable star in a run-of-the-mill galaxy-\"a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark,\" as the late Carl Sagan put it.' The fact that life flourishes on our planet isn't exceptional. Creatures of all kinds undoubtedly abound, we're told, in countless locations among th e ten trillion billion stars in the universe. Some scientists have estimated there are up to ten trillion advanced civilizations. 4 Sagan put the number at one million for our Milky Way galaxy alone. 5 After all, the forces of nature are so automatic that life is sure to have evolved wherever water exists. That's why whenever scientists raise new speculation about liquid water being present on another celestial body-the underground worlds of Jupiter's frozen moons Europa and Ganymede are currently the most fashionable examples then the automatic assumption is that living organisms must necessarily and inexorably follow. If life can emerge from nonlife so quickly and efficiently on a planet as undistinguished as ours, they reason, then why not throughout the uni verse's hundreds of billi ons of galaxies? To them, life is like a soup mix: just add water! The very title of astrobiologist David Da rling's recent book nicely encapsulates this optimistic philosophy: Life Everywhere.' He's enthusiastic about cl aims that \"life may arise inevitably whenever a suitable energy source, a concentrated supply of organic (carbon-based) material and water occur together.\" These ingredients, he said, \"are starting to look ubiquitous in"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"space. Consequently, he believes microbi al life, at least, \"is widespread.\" 8 In short, Earth has no privileged status. Polish scientist Nic holas Copernicus deflated our oversized ego by putting us in our place long ago- the universe doesn't revol ve around us; instead, we're just living in a humdrum hamlet off the b eaten path in a nondescri pt suburb of the vast Milky Way. We have no grand role, no meaning, no significance, no reason for being other than ... well, just being. \"The universe that we observe,\" said Oxford's Richard Dawkins, \"has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil and no good, nothing but blind, pitiless indifference.\" This is the essence of what I was taught as I studied science. Of c ourse, these conclusions neatly bolstered my atheistic values. Somehow I managed to avoid getting too depressed by the personal implications of all of this, strangely finding hope and insp iration in the belief that we are not alone in the universe. Even if God didn't exist, at least there were millions of advanced civilizations out there. BEAMING MESSAGES TO HERCULES Ever since I first watched the classic movie The Day the Earth Stood Still as a child, I've been enthralled by the fanciful im ages of teeming inter-galactic life portrayed in science fiction. Sure, Star Trek and Star Wars were silly-but still, the idea of other exotic creatures living in the strange nooks and crannies of the universe was always intriguing and even comforting to me. Later I became fascinated by the Drake Equation, an attempt by astronomer Frank Drake to quantify the number of civilizations that m ight exist in our galaxy. Th e equation factors in such variables as how many of the tw o hundred to three hundred billion stars in our Milky Way might resemble our own sun, the pe rcentage of stars that ma y have planets in habitable zones, and so forth. Though the specific numbers that scientists then plugged into Drake's equation mostly amounted to rank conjecture fueled by their own biases-one scientist admitted it was \"a way of compressing a large amount of ignorance into a small space\" 10 -this did lend an ai r of scientific certainty to a highly speculative issue. Then I cheered from afar in the mid-1970s as Drake and Sagan beamed a message of greeting to the great globular cluster M13, which is a c oncentration of a quarter million stars in the constellation Hercules. While I knew there wasn't much practical scien ce involved with this intragalactic phone call-it would take more than twenty-two thousand years for the message to reach its destination-nevertheless there was some thing romantic and adventurous about trying to communicate with the ci vilizations that most assuredly populated those distant stars. All of this helped form my perspective as I wo uld gaze over the years at the twinkling stars in the dark heavens. But now my attitude was changing. After st udying the latest evidence from various scientific disciplines -from astronomy to cosmology to geology to oceanography to microbiology-my conclusions were bei ng tugged in the opposite direction. It's turning out that the Earth is anything but ordinar y, that our sun is far from average, and that even the position of our plan et in the galaxy is eerily fortu itous. The idea that the universe is a flourishing hothouse of advanced civilizatio ns is now being undermined by surprising new scientific discoveries and fresh thinking. In short, new findings are suggesting that we are special.

They're"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"seeing signs of design, a kind of un likely fine-tuning for life simila r to the fine-tuning of physics that we explored in the previous chapter. In fact, said one noted resear cher, \"new evidence which could potentially have refuted the [design] hypothesis has only e nded up confirming it.\"\" Once again, we find the evidence of science pointing in the direction of a Creator. And rather than our lives bei ng purposeless, scientists fo r the first time are uncovering concrete evidence that s uggests at least one surprising purpose for whic h we were created-that is, to discover and learn about the su rroundings in which we have been placed. In other words, as we'll see in this chapter, one purpose for which we were designed is to do science itself. RIGHT PLACE, RIGHT TIME As the new millennium dawned, geologist Pete r D. Ward and astronomer Donald Brownlee, both professors at the University of Washingt on in Seattle, published a provocative and highly successful book that raised this disquieting question about Earth: \"What if it is utterly unique: the only planet with animals in this gala xy or even in the visible universe ... ?\" 12 Their book, Rare Earth, marshals evidence from a wide range of scientific disciplines to build its case that \"not only intel ligent life, but even the simplest of animal life, is exceedingly rare in our galaxy and in the universe.\" 13 They called the conclusion \"inescapable\" that \"Earth is a rare place indeed.\" 14 Although Ward and Brownlee uncritically buy into the idea that microbial life may very well be more prevalent, a view they draw from the way life seemed to have effortlessly developed on Earth \"about as soon as environmenta l conditions allowed its survival,\" 1 ' their conviction that the existence of complex life is \"extraordinarily ra re\" is bolstered by convin cing data divorced from any theological framework. Calling their book \"carefully reasoned and scien tifically astute,\" Don Johanson, director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University, rema rked: \"In spite of our wishful thinking, there just may not be other Mozarts or Monets.\" 16 David Levy, of comet Shoemaker- Levy fame, added, \"As we know it on Earth, complex life might be very rare, and very precious.\"\" Said the Times of London: \"If they are right it could be tim e to reverse a process that has been going on since Copernicus.\" 18 More and more scientists ar e observing the stunning ways in which our planet-against all odds-manages to fulfill a large number of finely balanced criteria that are absolutely crucial to supporting a habitat s uitable for humankind. \"Rather than being one planet among billi ons, Earth now appears to be the uncommon Earth,\" said science educators Ji mmy H. Davis and Harry L. Poe. \"The data imply that Earth may be the only planet in the ri ght place at the right time.\"' 19 A BOLD AND AUDACIOUS CLAIM Earth's location, its size, its composition, its stru cture, its atmosphere, its temperature, its internal dynamics, and its many intricate cycles that are essen tial to life-the carbon cycle, the oxygen cycle, the nitrogen cycle, the phosphorous cycle, the sulfur cycle, the calcium cycle, the sodium cycle, and so on-testify to the degree to which our planet is exquisitely and precariously balanced. 20 As they begin their influential textbook Earth, Frank Press of the National Academy of Sciences and Raymond Siever of Harvard University write about what they call \"the uniqueness"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"of planet Earth.\" 21 They note how its atmosphere filters out harmfu l ultraviolet radiation while working with the oceans to moderate the climate through the storing and redistributing of solar energy, and how the Earth is just large enough so that its gravity retains the atmo sphere and yet just small enough not to keep too many harmful gases. Then they describe the Earth's interior as ... ...a gigantic but delicately balanced heat engine fueled by radioactivity.... Were it running more slowly ... the con tinents might not have evolved to their present form.... Iron may never have melted and sunk to the liquid core, and the magnetic field would never have developed.... If there had been more radioactive fuel, and therefore a faster running engine, volcanic dust would have blotte d out the sun, the atmosphere would have been oppressively dense, and the surface woul d have been racked by daily earthquakes and volcanic explosions. 22 These kind of highly choreographe d geological processes-and there are lots of them-leave me shaking my head at the astounding ways in which our biosphere is precisely tuned for life. Even more interesting, though, is the \"why\" questio n behind them. What accounts for all of these astounding \"coincidences?\" Press and Siever, while marveling that Earth \"is a very special place,\" don't broach the possibility of design. 23 Ward and Brownle e skirt the issue in Rare Earth, preferring instead to occasionally p e pper in words like \"sheer luck \" and \"a rare chance happening.\" 2 4 At a conference, Ward remarked: \"We are just incredibly lucky. Somebod y had to win the big lottery, and we were it.\" But does luck really explain w hy Earth enjoys this incredible convergence of extremely unlikely circumstances that have allowed human beings to flouris h? Going far back into time, Christians have reached a far different conclu sion: Earth was created by God as the stage upon which the human drama would be played out. Wh at's amazing about modem science, including new discoveries just within the last few years, is that this view of the universe seems to be far better supported today than in ancient times. Consider the conclusion of Mi chael J. Denton, a senior resear ch fellow in human molecular genetics at the University of Ot ago in New Zealand, in his 1998 book Nature's Destiny: No other theory or concept ever imagined by man can equal in boldness and audacity this great claim ... that all the starry heavens, that every species of life, that every characteristic of reality exists [to crea te a livable habitat] for mankind.... But most remarkably, given its audacity, it is a claim which is very far from a discredited prescientific myth. In fact, no observation has ever laid th e presumption to rest. And today, four centuries after the scientific re volution, the doctrine is again reemerging. In these last decades of the twentieth century , its credibility is being enhanced by discoveries in several branches of fundamental science. 25 How true are those words? Do the special conditions that allow for life on Earth demand a designer? To pursue reliable answers, I arranged a rendezvous at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago with two experts who had just coll aborated on a ground-break ing book concerning this very topic. This would be a pe rfect opportunity to explore the stunning uniqueness of our planet. "},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"INTERVIEW #5: GUILLERMO GONZALEZ, PHD, AND JAY WESLEY RICHARDS, PHD Tall, blond Jay Wesley Richards, dressed in a navy blazer, is an Ivy League philosopher who speaks in rapid-fire bursts with unflagging ent husiasm. Guillermo Gonzalez, clad in a short- sleeve shirt, his thinning hair cropped short, is a nuts-and- bolts astronomer who talks in professorial tones on such t opics as, \"Chemical Abundance Tr ends among RV Tauri Stars.\" Together, they authored The Privileged Planet, which documents astonishing evidence pointing toward a designer for Earth-and toward at least one apparent purpose for humankind. Gonzalez is informally known as a \"star guy.\" After graduating summa cum laude with degrees in astronomy and physics from the Universi ty of Arizona, he late r earned his master's degree and doctorate in astronom y from the University of Wa shington at Seattle. Now an assistant professor at Iowa State University, hi s research centers on low and intermediate mass stars and theories about stel lar and planetary evolution. He's a hands-on and yet conceptually sophis ticated scientist, ha ving logged countless hours doing research through telescopes at Cerro Tololo Internationa l Observatory, located at an altitude of 6,600 feet in Chile, a nd four other locations. He is ad ept at analyzing photometric and spectroscopic data. A member of the Interna tional Astronomical Union and the American Scientific Affiliation, the low-key but engaging Gonzalez has seen dozens of his articles published in technical journals and featured on the covers of such popular magazines as Scientific American. An academic overachiever with a sincere, se lf-effacing personality, Richards holds three advanced degrees in philosophy and theology, incl uding a doctorate from Princeton Theological Seminary. He authored The Untamed God and has edited or contributed to such books as Unapologetic Apologetics, Signs of Intelligence, and Are We Spiritual Machines? His articles have appeared in public ations ranging from Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith to the Washington Post to the Princeton Theological Review. As vice president of the Discovery Institute, Richards is considered a bright star in the burgeoning Intelligent Design movement. Each of us clutching a soft dr ink, we met in an airlines hosp itality suite, with Richards and Gonzalez sitting across from me at a granite co nference table under florescent lights in a simple room devoid of character. Anxious to proceed, I barely let them settle into their chairs before unleashing my first question. THE COPERNICAN PRINCIPLE I turned toward Richards. \"I wa s taught in school that our planet is unex ceptional, that we revolve around a typical star in an average, mundane part of th e universe, and that there's nothing particularly unusual or special ab out Earth,\" I began. \"Isn't that the view of most scientists today?\" \"Yes, that's the so-called Principle of Medioc rity or the Copernican Principle,\" Richards replied. \"Open any introductory astronomy textbook and you'll see it stated over and over that we should assume there's nothing special about our situation, our location in the universe, or the particular features of the Earth, the solar system, or humans themselves.\" \"But,\" I interjected, \"isn't that appropriate in some sense?\" \"Yes, of course,\" he said. \"We shouldn't assume that the Earth, our solar system, or our sun is unique in every possible way. We wouldn't be able to do science if ever y place in the universe had a different law of gravity or atom s had a different mass. That's fine.\""},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"\"Then where does the problem come in?\" I asked. \"The problem is that the Copernican Princi ple has taken a metaphysically bloated form, which essentially says our metaphysical status is as insignificant as our astronomical location. In other words, we're not here for a purpose, we're not special in any way, and we don't occupy a privileged place in the cosmos.\" I interrupted again. \"Yet isn't it true that Cope rnicus's discovery-that the sun doesn't revolve around the Earth, but that th e Earth revolves around the s un-quite naturally demoted humankind?\" Richards nodded wearily as if he had heard that comment a lot. \"Let's go back to the beginning,\" he said. He stood, re moved his jacket, and draped it over an unoccupied chair. Sitting back down, he continued. \"The story is that the ancients-Aristotle, Ptol emy, medieval Christians-a ll thought we were at the center of the universe, sort of the throne of the cosmos, the most important place that everything revolved around. Then Copernicus and Kepler came along and said they can explain the movement of the planets better by assuming that the sun is at the center and that the planets- including Earth-revolve around it. So we've been displaced from the center and removed from our position of privilege. \"This was the start of a long march of science th at continued to demote us. Scientists later determined the sun isn't at the center of the univers e; that we aren't at the center of the galaxy; and that the universe ultimately had no center, because scientists came to believe in the nineteenth century that it was in finite and eternal. You can see how this trend helped us to see ourselves as less and less significant, less and less at th e center of things. \"So the Copernican Revolution came to represent the conflict between science and religion. Religious superstition maintained the Earth and humankind are the center of the universe, both physically and metaphysically, but m odern science has disproved that. \"Humans have been stripped of their fals e sense of uniqueness and importance. While religious folk continued to insist there is so mething unique, special, intentional, and purposeful about our existence, scientists maintain that the material world is all there is, and that chance and impersonal natural law alone explain its existence.\" I was following along in full agreement. Richards 's assessment was entirely consistent with what I had been taught in school. But then he added the clincher. \"The problem,\" he said , a slight smile playing at the co rner of his mouth, \"is that this historical description is simply false.\" SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT Richards's claim startled me. \"False?\" I declared. \"What do you mean? In what way?\" \"Read Ptolemy, Galileo, Copernicus, Kepler. Read Dante,\" he said. \"In Dante's Divine Comedy, the surface of the Earth is an intermediate place. This was true in Aristotelian cosmology, which was Christianized in the Middle Ages. For Aristotle, th e world was made of air, earth, fire, and water. Earth is heav iest, so it naturally falls to the bottom. \"So the Earth was not so much at the center as it was at the bottom of the universe. It was sort of the cosmic sump. It was the place where th ings decay and die. Everything above the moon was made of a different type of matter-quintes sence-and God dwelled in the heavenly sphere outside the celestial sphere of the stars. Man was in an intermediate place.\" Gonzalez spoke up. \"Dante then inverted these levels as you go the other way, down to hell,\" he said."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"\"Exactly,\" continued Richards. \"You had ni ne levels going up to ward God and getting closer to perfection, and then th ere were nine levels getting closer to absolute depravity, down to hell. Thus, in medieval cosmology, what we would call the center of the universe is Satan's throne. That's a very important point. If you imag ine the center of the universe is Satan's throne and that the Earth itself is the cosmic sump, then clearly this is not the stereotype that we've been given that the center of the universe pr ior to Copernicus was the preeminent spot.\" Gonzalez added: \"The Enlightenment later retold the story by saying the church, because of its arrogance, put humans in the center.\" Richards nodded. \"That's the irony,\" he said. \"I t was the Enlightenment that made man the measure of all things. When you really think about it, Christian theology never actually put man literally in the center. We have a very important role to play in this cosmic drama, so much so that God even becomes incarnate. But it was never the case that everything was literally created solely for us. \"Many centuries ago, Augustine said God didn't create the world `for man' or because of some sort of compulsion, but `because he want ed to.'26 In The Divine Comedy, the reader learns that the actual sens e of us being in the center was merely a bias. We discover, in fact, that everything was arranged so that Go d is at the metaphysical center- that is, the place of supreme importance. \"Instead of denigrating Earth, actually C opernicus, Galileo, and Kepler saw their new scheme as exalting it. For instance, Galileo wa xes poetic about how the Earth, like the other planets, reflects the glory of the sun and is no longer just a cosmic sump. So in the trans- formation from medieval cosmology to the Renai ssance view, this new perspective elevated man in some ways.\" Other historical researchers have come to th e same conclusion. Said one: \"The Copernican system, far from demoting man, destroyed Aristotle's vision of the earth as a kind of cosmic sink, and if it did anything, it elevated humanity. In making the earth a planet, a heavenly body, Copernicus infinitely ennobled its status.\" But something didn't add up to me. \"Didn't th e church persecute Copernicus, Galileo, and Giordano Bruno for their view that the Earth revolved around the sun?\" I asked. \"First of all,\" Richards said, \"some claim C opernicus was persecuted, but history shows he wasn't; in fact, he died of natural causes the sa me year his ideas were published. As for Galileo, his case can't be reduced to a simple conflict be tween scientific truth an d religious superstition. He insisted the church immediatel y endorse his views rather than allow them to gradually gain acceptance, he mocked the pope, and so forth. Yes, he was censured, but the church kept giving him his pension for the rest of his life.\" Indeed, historian William R. Shea said, \"Ga lileo's condemnation was the result of the complex interplay of untoward political circumst ances, political ambitions, and wounded prides.\" Historical researcher Philip J. Sampson noted th at Galileo himself was convinced that the \"major cause\" of his troubles was that he had made \"fun of his Holiness\"-that is, Pope Urban VIII-in a 1632 treatise. As for his punishment, Alfred North Whitehead put it this way: \"Galileo suffered an honorable detention and a mild reproof , before dying peacefully in his bed.\" \"Bruno's case was very sad,\" Richards cont inued. \"He was executed in Rome in 1600. Certainly this is a stain on church history. But again, this was a complicated case. His Copernican views were incident al. He defended pantheism and was actually executed for his heretical views on the Trinity, th e Incarnation, and other doctrines that had nothing to do with Copernicanism."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"\"Now, here's the point I want to make: it's very important if you're going to advance the Copernican Principle that you make it look like it's grounded in the historical march of science. But when you actually look at th e data, it's just not true. Write rs of astronomy textbooks just keep recycling the myth, sort of like the flat-Earth myth, which was the idea that Columbus was told the Earth was flat and he thought it was round. That's just wrong too.\" \"Scholars at the time knew it was a sphere,\" added Gonzalez. \"Even the ancient Greeks knew it was a sphere.\" \"They'd known it for a thousand years or more,\" said Richards. I knew they were right about that. David Lindberg, former professor of the history of science and currently director of the Institute for Rese arch in the Humanities at the University of Wisconsin, said in a recent interview: One obvious [myth] is that before Columbus , Europeans believed nearly unanimously in a flat Earth-a belief allegedly drawn from certa in biblical statements and enforced by the medieval church. This myth seems to have ha d an eighteenth century origin, elaborated and popularized by Washington Irving, who flagra ntly fabricated evidence for it in his four-volume history of Colum bus.... The truth is that it's a lmost impossible to find an educated person after Aristotle who doubts th at the Earth is a sphere. In the Middle Ages, you couldn't emerge from any kind of education, cathedral school or university, without being perfectly clear about the Earth's sphericity and even its approximate circumference. 32 Now in addition to the flat-Earth myth bei ng exploded, here were Richards and Gonzalez asserting that the Copernican Principl e was based on faulty history as well. \"So,\" continued Richards, \"Guillermo and I embarked on a project to document whether there are important ways in which Earth is special or exceptional. To do this we had to show that there's not this long historical march of science showing how unimportant we are. We had to point out that the history is wrong and that what we're doing stands in the good tradition of science, which says, `Let's find out what the world is like to the best of our ability.\"' \"And,\" I said, \"what did you find?\" Richards and Gonzalez exchanged glances. \"We ll, scientists have generally followed the Copernican Principle by saying th at our planet is ordinary a nd that therefore life undoubtedly abounds in the universe,\" Richards began. \"We believe, however, the evidence is quite to the contrary.\" He gestured toward his colleague to continue. \"We've found that our lo cation in the universe, in our gala xy, in our solar system, as well as such things as the size and ro tation of the Earth, the mass of the moon and sun and so forth-a whole range of factors-c onspire together in an amazing way to make Earth a habitable planet,\" Gonzalez said. \"And even beyond that, we've found th at the very same conditions that allow for intelligent life on Earth also make it strangely well-suited for viewing and analyzing the universe.\" \"And we suspect this is not an accident,\" Richards added. \"In fact, we raise the question of whether the universe has been li terally designed for discovery.\" THE INGREDIENTS FOR LIFE With that framework set, I moved ahead to discuss one of the main attitudes of scientists who embrace the Copernican Principle. \"They believe if you can just find a place anywhere in the"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"universe where w ater stays liquid for a long e nough period of time, then li fe will deve lop, just as it did on Earth,\" I said. \"I assume you don't agree with that.\" \"No, I don't,\" Gonzalez said. \"It's true that in order to have life you need water-which is the universal solvent-for reactions to take place, as well as carbon, whic h serves as the core atom of the information-carrying structur al molecules of life. But you also need a lot more. Humans require twenty-six essential elements; a bacter ium about sixteen. Intermediate life forms are between those two numbers. The problem is that not just any planetary body will be the source of all those chemical ingredients in the necessary forms and amounts.\" I interrupted to point out that science fiction writers have managed to speculate about extra- terrestrial life that's built in a radically differe nt form-for instance, cr eatures based on silicon instead of carbon. Gonzalez was shaking his head before I had ev en finished my question. \"That just won't work,\" he insisted. \"Chemistry is one of the better understood areas of science. We know that you just can't get certain atoms to stick together in sufficient nu mber and complexity to give you large molecules like carbon can. You can't get ar ound it. And you just can't get other types of liquids to dissolve as many different kinds of chemicals as you can with water. There's something like half a dozen different properties of both water and carbon that are optimal for life. Nothing else comes close. Silicon falls far short of carbon. \"Unfortunately, people see life as being easy to create. They th ink it's enough merely to have liquid water, because they see life as an epiphe nomenon-just a piece of slime mold growing on an inert piece of granit e. Actually, the Earth's geology and biology interact very tightly with each other. You can't think of life as being inde pendent of the geophysical and meteorological processes of the planet. They interact in a very intimate way. So you need not only the right chemicals for life but also a planetar y environment that's tuned to life.\" That sparked a related issue. Scientists have dreamed of terraformin g a planet like Mars, essentially making over its environment to create a planet that's more conducive to settlement by humans. \"Would that be very difficult?\" I asked. \"Absolutely. From the magnetic field to pl ate tectonics to the carbon dioxide cycle-ongoing life depends on a variety of very cornplicated interactions with the planet,\" he said. Richards jumped in. \"People generally think that because they plant a se ed and it grows that it's easy to create the right environment for life, but that's misleading,\" he said. \"A good example is the hermetically sealed biosphere that some people constructed in Arizon a several years ago. They thought it would be relatively easy to create a self-contained environment conducive to life, but they had a dev il of a time trying to make it work.\" \"But life can also exist in some terribly harsh conditions,\" I pointed out. \"For instance, there are life forms that live off of deepsea thermal vents. They don't seem to need oxygen or any particular support from the broader environment.\" \"On the contrary,\" Gonzalez said, \"the only things down there that don't need oxygen are some microorganisms that breathe methane. But la rger organisms, which need to regulate their metabolism, are invariably oxygen-breathers. The oxygen comes from surface life and marine algae. The oxygen gets mixed in with the ocean and transported into deep waters. So those organisms are very directly tied to the surf ace and the overall ecosystem of the planet.\" Astounded by the Earth's fine-tuned physical, ch emical, and biological interrelationships, some writers have gone so far as to liken our biosphere to a \"superorganism\" that is quite literally alive. In fact, James Lovelock's pantheistic Gaia Hypothesis even seeks to deify our planet. However, Gonzalez and Richards said it's unnecessary to go that far."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"\"Despite these admittedly incredib le interrelationships, there's nothing that requires anyone to see the Earth itself as being an organism, especially a god or goddess,\" Richards said. Then he turned to an image quite familiar to those who see the earmarks of design in Earth's complex and interconnected machinery. \"That's so rt of like deifying a watch because of its amazing properties,\" he said, \"r ather than looking beyond the wa tch to the one who made it.\" THE HOSTILE WORLD OF M13 I granted the point that only ce rtain kinds of planetary environm ents can play host to life. On the other hand, the universe is sa lted with trillions of stars, with countless terrestrial bodies undoubtedly revolving around them. Surely the math ematical odds favor many stars spawning Earth-like habitats-a point that argues agains t the idea that Earth is special and therefore designed. But while my untrained eyes see each star as having equal potential to preside over a civilization-bearing solar system , I was soon to learn differe ntly as I pursued questions concerning the conditions that are necessary for life to flourish. I turned toward Gonzalez. \"As we look out at the billions of stars that constitute our Milky Way galaxy,\" I said, \"can't we logically assume th at planets teeming with life are strewn all over the place?\" \"No,\" he said unequivocally, \"that's not a logical assumption based on the evidence. Along with Don Brownlee and Peter Ward of the Univ ersity of Washington, I developed a concept called the Galactic Habitable Zone-that is, a zone in the galaxy where habitable planets might be possible. You see, you just can't form a habitabl e planet anywhere; there's a large number of threats to life as you go from place to place.\" My mind flashed back to when Drake and Sagan beamed their message to the large concentration of stars called globular cluster M13. Their theory was that by transmitting their greeting toward a place packed with stars, th ere would be a higher ch ance of detection by an intelligent civilization. When I asked Gonzalez what he thought of that experiment, his reply was immediately dismissive. \"The problem is that if the probability of life at any one star is zero, then the probability for all the stars remains zero,\" he said. \"Zero?\" I replied. \"There are more than a quarter million stars in that globular cluster. Don't you think any of them harbor planets with life?\" Gonzalez stood his ground. \"A globular cluster is one of the worst places in the entire galaxy to expect any life,\" he replied. \"Why?\" \"Two reasons,\" he said. \"First, globular cluste rs are among the most ancient things in our galaxy. Since they're extremely old, their stars have a very low abundance of heavy elements- carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, calcium, and so on. Instead, they're made up almost entirely of hydrogen and helium. In contrast, Earth is composed of iron, oxygen, magnesium, and silicone. Next comes sulfur. \"You see, the Big Bang produced basically hydrogen and helium. That's what the earliest stars were made of. The heavier elements were synthesized-cooked, if you will-in the interior of stars. Eventually, when these stars exploded as supernovae, these elements got expelled into the interstellar medium. They coalesced into other stars, where more heavy elements were cooked. Then they were expelled again and again, with stars subsequently containing ever-greater amounts of these `metals,' or heavier elements."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"\"Now, you need these elements to eventually bu ild terrestrial planets like Earth. Because the very old stars in globular clusters formed so early that they're composed virtually exclusively of hydrogen and helium, they're not going to have planets accompanying them. Maybe there will be dust, or grains, or boulders, but that's about it. You're not going to have Earth-size planets. \"The second problem is that globular clusters are so densely packed with stars that they wouldn't allow for stable, circular orbits to ex ist around them. The gravitational pull of the stars would create elliptical orbits that would take a hypotheti cal planet into extremes of cold and heat, which would create a life -prohibitive situation.\" His assessment made sense, but it caused me to wonder why Sagan and Drake, both knowledgeable astronomers, would waste their time trying to co mmunicate with the stars of M13. Gonzalez shook his head when I asked him about it. \"It's really surprising that th ey would think there would be any chance of a civilization receiving their message in a gl obular cluster,\" Gonzalez said. \"They should have known better! Frankly, I think they were so deluded by their complete belief in the metaphysical Copernican Principle-that life was just going to be everywhere in the gala xy-that they overlooked the facts.\" LIVING IN THE SAFE ZONE Gonzalez's explanation made me wonder about th e suitability of othe r places to harbor intelligent life. I knew that there are three basic type s of galaxies in our universe. First, there are spiral galaxies like our own Milky Way. These are dominat ed by a central spherical bulge and a disk with \"spiral arms\" extending outward from the nucleus in a spir al pattern, resembling a celestial pinwheel. Second, there are elliptical galaxies, which are sort of egg-shaped. And, third, there are irregular galaxies, which appear disorganized and dist orted. I asked Gon zalez to assess the life-bearing potential of each one. \"Certainly, our type of galaxy optimizes habitability, because it provides safe zones,\" he said, his tone professorial. \"And Earth happens to be located in a safe area, which is why life has been able to flourish here. \"You see, galaxies have varying degrees of star formation, where interste llar gases coalesce to form stars, star clusters, and massive stars that blow up as supernovae. Places with active star formation are very dangerous, because that's where you have supernovae exploding at a fairly high rate. In our galaxy, those da ngerous places are primarily in the spiral arms, where there are also hazardous giant molecular cl ouds. Fortunately, though, we ha ppen to be situated safely between the Sagittarius and Perseus spiral arms. \"Also, we're very far from the nucleus of the galaxy, which is also a dangerous place. We now know that there's a massive black hole at the center of our galaxy. In fact, the Hubble space telescope has found that nearly every large near by galaxy has a giant black hole at its nucleus. And believe me-these are dangerous things! \"Most black holes, at any given time, are inacti ve. But whenever anything gets near or falls into one, it gets torn up by the strong tidal forces. Lots of high energy is released-gamma rays, X-rays, particle radiatio n-and anything in the inner region of the galaxy would be subjected to high radiation levels. That's very dangerous for life forms. The center of the galaxy is also dangerous because there are more supernovae exploding in that region. \"One more thing: the composition of a spiral galaxy changes as you go out from the center. The abundance of heavy elements is greater towards the center, because that's where star formation has been more vigorous over the history of the galaxy. So it has been able to cook the hydrogen and helium into heavy elements more quickly, whereas in the outer disk of the galaxy,"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"star formation has been going on more slowly over the years and so the abundance of heavy elements isn't quite as high. Consequently, the out er regions of the disk are less likely to have Earth-type planets. \"Now, put all of this together-t he inner region of the galaxy is much more dangerous from radiation and other threats; the outer part of the galaxy isn't goi ng to be able to form Earth-like planets because the heavy elements are not a bundant enough; and I haven't even mentioned how the thin disk of our galaxy helps our sun stay in its desirable circula r orbit. A very eccentric orbit could cause it to cross spiral arms and visit th e dangerous inner regions of the galaxy, but being circular it remain s in the safe zone. \"All of this,\" he said, his voice sounding a bit triumphant, \"work s together to create a narrow safe zone where life-susta ining planets are possible.\" SCANNING THE STARS FOR LIFE Suddenly, the Earth was sounding pretty special, nest led as it is in a sliver of space that gives it safe haven from the otherwise menacing cond itions of the Milky Way. But what about other types of galaxies? Might they also provide threat-free neighbor hoods for lifepopulated planets? \"What about elliptical galaxies?\" I asked Gon zalez. \"Do they have the potential to harbor life?\" \"Elliptical galaxies look amorphous and are sort of egg-shaped, with stars having very random orbits, like bees swarming a beehive,\" he explained. \"The problem for life in these galaxies is that the stars vis it every region, which means they'll occasionally visit the dangerous, dense inner regions, where a black hole may be active. In any event, you're less likely to find Earth-like planets in elliptical galaxies because mo st of them lack the heavy elements needed to form them.\" This was an important point, because I knew th at most galaxies fall into the elliptical category. \"Most elliptical galaxies are less massive and luminous than our galaxy,\" Gonzalez continued. \"Our galaxy is on the top one or two percent of the most massive and luminous. The bigger the galaxy, the more heavy elements it can have, because its stronger gravity can attract more hydrogen and helium and cycle them to bu ild heavy elements. In the low-mass galaxies, which make up the vast majority, you can have w hole galaxies without a single Earth-like planet. They just don't have enough of the heavy elemen ts to construct Earths. Just like a globular cluster-you can have a whole globu lar cluster with hundreds of thousands of stars, and yet there won't be a single Earth. \"If you look at the deepest pictures ever taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, they show literally thousands of galaxies when the un iverse was really young. People have commented, `Wow, look at all those galaxies ! I wonder how many civilizations there are looking back at us?' In that picture, I'd say zero. Thousands and thous ands and thousands of galaxies-but zero Earths, because the heavier elements haven't built up enough yet.\" Richards interrupted to say, \"Of course, we're not looking at these galaxies as they exist now; we're looking back in time, say, nine billion years ago. It's possible that some of those galaxies are now at the state where the Milk y Way is. We don't know for sure.\" \"But,\" added Gonzalez, \"this was back when it was much more dangerous, because it's the era of quasars, supernovae going off, and black holes. Even if you had a few regions in the galaxy where there were sufficient heavy elements to build Earths, they would have been so irradiated that life wouldn't be possible.\""},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"With elliptical galaxies being unlikely sites for budding civilizations, I turned to the last category of galaxy, called i rregulars. \"What's their pot ential for life?\" I asked. \"Like the ellipticals, they also don't provide a safe harbor. In fact, they're worse. They're distorted and ripped apart, with supernovae going off throughout th eir volume. There are no safe places where there are fewer supernovae explod ing, like we have between our spiral arms. \"In fact, astronomers keep findi ng new threats to life. For exam ple, we're learning more about gamma ray bursts, which are more powerful than a supernova. If one of these goes off near you, the lights go out. So the probability for there being civilizations elsewhere actually keeps declining as we learn about the new thr eats that we didn't know about before.\" \"What's your opinion, then, about where Eart h is located in the universe?\" I asked. \"In terms of habitability, I think we are in th e best possible place,\" Gonzalez said. \"That's because our location provides enough building blocks to yield an Earth, while providing a low level of threats to life. I really can't come up wi th an example of another place in the galaxy that is as friendly to life as our location. Sometim es people claim you can be in any part of any galaxy. Well, I've studied other re gions-spiral arms, galactic center s, globular clusters, edge of disks-and no matter where it is, it's worse for life. I can't think of any better place than where we are.\" \"That's ironic,\" I said. \"It's the reve rse of the Copernican Principle.\" Richards agreed. \"The propaganda of the Copern ican Principle has been that the long march of science has shown how common and ordinary our situation is. But the trend is in the opposite direction. The more you pile on th e threats we're discovering in mo st places in the universe, and you contrast that with the many ways we're in a cocoon of safety, the more our situation appears special.\" \"The most famous example is our own solar system,\" Gonzalez said. \"At one time or another, scientists have specula ted that there are ci vilizations on just a bout every body in our solar system-the moon, Mars, Jupiter. \"Percival Lowell built his own observatory in Arizona to find these civilizations on Mars. He actually quoted Copernicus to justify his be lief that we can't be the only civilization. Now they've backtracked to the point of saying, well, maybe there's some very simple slime mold beneath the surface of Mars or Eu ropa. And even that is extremely questionable. That's how far back they've had to retreat.\" \"Very often,\" observed Richards , \"the Copernican Principle describes properties that don't matter. Who really cares whether we're in the phys ical center of the ga laxy? It's irrelevant! What really matters is being in the place that's most conducive to life. And that's exactly where Earth finds itself.\" PLANETS CIRCLING OTHER STARS Within the last few years, astronomers finally have been able to discover planets orbiting other stars-a major confirmation of what was once merely widesp read speculation. \"Doesn't this confirm that there's nothing particularly out of the ordinary about our nine-planet system?\" I asked. \"I'll concede,\" said Gonzalez, \"that it demonstrates our sola r system is not unique when it comes to having planets circling a star. But prior to the detection of the first planet orbiting another sun-like star in 1995, the expectation wa s that astronomers would find giant gas planets in large circular orbits, much like Jupiter. Jup iter orbits the sun in tw elve years in a nearly circular orbit, far out from the terrestrial planets-Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"\"However, we're finding that the planets circling other stars are quite different from Jupiter. They orbit over a full range of distances, from ju st a tiny fraction of an Astronomical Unit-which is the distance between the Earth and the sun-ou t to several Astronomical Units. Most of their orbits are highly elliptical; ve ry few are circular. These str ongly non-circular orbits utterly surprised astronomers. Because they strongly subs cribed to the Copernican Principle, they had expected that other planetary syst ems would be just like ours. A nd that expectation was basically dashed.\" \"What's wrong with an elliptical orbit for those kind of planets?\" I asked. \"It poses a problem for the habita bility of any terrestrial planet s in their system, because it would make them less likely to have stable circ ular orbits,\" Gonzalez replied. \"For example, Earth's orbit is almost a perfect circle. A planet with the mass of the Earth would be sensitive to any of the gas giant planets if they had more eccentric orbits. The Earthlike planet's own orbit would be affected, making it less circular and therefore subjec ting the planet to dangerous surface temperature variations.\" \"So,\" I said, \"if our own Jupiter had a more e lliptical orbit, the Earth wouldn't be able to maintain as circular an orbit and have the stea dy temperature and predictable climate that come with that.\" \"That's right,\" he said. \"In fact, even small vari ations in our nearly circular orbit can cause ice ages, because of temperature shifts on the surface of the planet. We have to maintain a circular orbit as much as possible to maintain a relatively steady te mperature. That's only possible because Jupiter's orbit isn't very elliptical and therefore doesn't threaten to distort our round orbit.\" TAKING HITS FOR EARTH Now that we were discussing our solar system, I wanted to delve into other \"local\" factors that make our planet habitable. \"What is it about our solar system that contributes to life on Earth?\" I asked. \"A surprising amount,\" said Gonzalez. \"Mor e and more, astronomers are learning how the other planets tie into the habita bility of Earth. For example, Ge orge Wetherill of the Carnegie Institution showed in 1994 that Jupiter-which is huge, more th an three hundred times the mass of the Earth-acts as a shield to protect us from too many comet impacts. It actually deflects comets and keeps many of them from coming in to the inner solar system, where they could collide with Earth with life -extinguishing consequences. \"This was illustrated very nicely by the imp act of Comet Shoemaker Levy 9 into Jupiter in July, 1994. This comet was attracted by Jupiter's tremendous gravitational pull and broke into fragments, with all of there hitt ing Jupiter. Even Saturn and Ura nus participate in that kind of cometcatching. \"In addition, the other planets in our inner solar system prot ect us from getting bombarded by asteroids from the asteroid belt. The asteroid s are mostly between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Our first line of defense is Mars, being at the e dge of the asteroid be lt. It takes a lot of hits for us. Venus does too. If you want to get an idea of the stuff that probably would have hit the Earth, look at the surface of the moon. The moon, unfortunately, has too little surface area to provide much protection, but it's a nice record.\" \"What about the Earth's position in the solar system?\" I asked. \"How much does that contribu te to its habitability?\" \"There's a concept invented by astrobiologist s called the Circumstellar Habitable Zone."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"That's the region around a star where you can ha ve liquid water on the surface of a terrestrial planet. This is determined by the amount of light you get from the host star. \"You can't be too close, otherwise too much wa ter evaporates into the atmosphere and it causes a runaway greenhouse effect, and you boil off the oceans. We think that might be what happened to Venus. But if you get too far out, it gets too cold. Water and carbon dioxide freeze and you eventually develop runaway glaciation. \"The main point is that as you go further ou t from the sun, you have to increase the carbon dioxide content of the planet's at mosphere. This is necessary in or der to trap the sun's radiation and keep water liquid. The problem is that there wouldn't be enough oxygen to have mammal- like organisms. It's only in the very inner edge of the Circum stellar Habitable Zone where you can have low enough carbon dioxide and high enough oxygen to sustain complex animal life. And that's where we are.\" \"So if the Earth's distance from the sun were moved by, say, five percent either way, what would happen?\" I asked. \"Disaster,\" came his quick reply. \"Animal life would be impossible. The zone for animal life in the solar system is much narrower than most people think.\" \"And that's why you need a circular orbit like the one Earth has,\" Richards added. \"You don't just want to be in the Circumstellar Habita ble Zone part of the tim e; you want to be in it continuously. It doesn't do you any good to have melted water for four months and then have the whole planet freeze up again.\" OUR OVERACHIEVING SUN Obviously, the key to continued life on Earth is the sun, whose nuclear fusion, taking place at twenty-seven million degrees Fahrenheit at its core, provides us with consistent warmth and energy ninetythree million miles away. Ever since witnessing a solar eclipse as a c hild, carefully protecting my eyes by observing the phenomenon through a projected image inside a cardboard box, I have been fascinated by this fiery behemoth, whose mass is an incomprehensible three hundred thousa nd times greater than the Earth's. However, I had always been told that there was nothi ng out of the ordinary about the sun. As one text says flatly: \"The sun is a common fixed star. \"33 And if the sun is truly so average, so typical, so undistinguished, then the logical implication would be that lots of life-bearing Earths must be orbiting around lots of sim ilar suns throughout the universe. \"Today, astronomers know a lot more about star s than they did when I was growing up,\" I said to Gonzalez. \"Is the consensus still that the sun is just a common star?\" \"No, not at all,\" Gonzalez replied. \"It's just re cently that some new astronomy textbooks are finally starting to say that, well, the sun really is unusual after all. For instance, it's among the ten percent most massive stars in the galaxy. In fact, if you pick a star at random, you're likely to pick one that's far less massive than the sun, usually red dwarfs, whic h make up about eighty percent of stars. Another eight or nine percent are called G dwarfs, most of which also are less massive than the sun. The sun is a yellow dwar f; technically, it has a G2 Spectral Type.\" His comment about the ubiquity of red dwarfs piqued my curiosity. \"Since red dwarfs dominate the universe, let's talk about them for a moment. Are they conducive to having life- bearing planets orbiting them?\" I asked. \"I don't think they are,\" Gonzalez said. \"Why not?\""},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"\"Several reasons. First, red dwarfs emit most of their radiation in the red part of the spectrum, which makes photosynthesis less efficien t. To work well, photosynthesis requires blue and red light. But a much greater problem is th at as you decrease the mass of a star, you also decrease its luminosity. A planet w ould have to orbit this kind of star much closer in order to have sufficient heat to maintain liquid water on its surface. \"The problem is the tidal force between the st ar and the planet gets stronger as you move in, so the planet will spin down and eventually end up in what's called a tidally locked state. This means it always presents the same face towa rds the star. That's very bad, because it causes large temperature differences between the lit side and the unlit side. The lit side would be terribly dry and hot, while the unlit side w ould be prohibitively icy and cold. And there's another problem-red dwarfs have flares.\" \"But,\" I said, \"the sun has flares too.\" \"That's right. And the intensity of flares on red dwarfs is about the same as on our sun. The difference is that red dwarfs as a whole emit much less total light, so they're much less luminous. That means in comparison to the luminosity of the star, the output of the flare is high.\" \"Whoa!\" I said, putting up my hand in protest. \"You've lost me.\" Gonzalez regrouped. \"Okay, let me ge t to the bottom line: for this kind of star, flares cause the star's total luminosity to var y. In fact, astronomers call them `flare stars,' and they watch as they get much brighter for a while and then dimmer again. We don't pay too much attention to the solar flares of our sun, because the sun is so luminous that the flares are like a little blip. You barely notice them.\" \"And remember we're ninety-three million miles from the sun,\" Richards said. \"With a red dwarf, your planet would have to be much closer to the star.\" \"Right,\" said Gonzalez. \"The luminosity increase would ca use temperature spikes on the surface of an orbiting planet. But just as bad woul d be the increased particle radiation that would result from the flares. On Earth, we get a very mild effect called the aurora borealis. This is where there's a flare on the sun, the particles eventually reach the Earth, they're funneled down the magnetic field to the north a nd south poles, and we see the auro ra borealis as these beautiful lights in the northern hemisphere. \"However, particle radiation has the effect of quickly stripping away the atmosphere, increasing the surface radiation levels, but most importantly, destroying the ozone layer, which we need to protect from radiation. All of this wo uld be deadly for any life on a planet near a red dwarf. \"And then red dwarfs have one more problem : they don't produce much ultraviolet light, which you need early on to build up oxygen in the a tmosphere. Scientists believe that the oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere was built up at fi rst by the ultraviolet radiation that broke u p water into oxygen and hydrogen. The oxygen was allowed to build u p in the atmosphere, while the hydrogen escaped into space, because it's lighter. But you get very little blue light from a red dwarf, so this phenomenon wouldn't occur as ra pidly and you wouldn't get the build up of the oxygen you need to sustain life. \"Fortunately, our sun is not only the right mass, but it also emits the right colors-a balance of red and blue. As a matter of fact, if we were orbiting a more massive star, called an F dwarf, there would be much more blue radiation that would build up the oxygen and ozone layer even faster. But any momentary interru ption of the ozone layer woul d subject the planet to an immediate flood of highly intense ultraviolet ra diation, which would be disastrous to life."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"\"Also, the more massive stars don't live as long- that's the major problem . Stars that are even just a little more massive than th e sun live only a few billion years. Our sun is expected to last a total of about ten billion years on its main sequence, burning hydrogen steadily, whereas stars just a few tens of percent more massive have considerably less lifetim e on the main sequence. And while on the main sequence, they change luminosity much faster. Everything on their lifecycle happens faster.\" \"Anything else that makes our sun unusual?\" I asked. \"Yes, the sun is metal-rich; in other words, it has a higher abundance of heavy elements compared to other stars of its age in this region of the galaxy. As it turns out, the sun's metallicity may be near the golden mean for build ing Earth-size habitable terrestrial planets. \"And the sun is highly stable, more so than most comparable stars. Its light output only varies by one-tenth of one percent over a full suns pot cycle, which is about eleven years. This prevents wild climate swings on Earth. \"Another way it's anomalous is that the sun's orb it is more nearly circular in the galaxy than most other stars of its age. That helps by keeping us away from the galaxy's dangerous spiral arms. If the sun's orbit were more eccentric, we could be exposed to the kind of galactic dangers I mentioned earlier, such as explosions of supernovae.\" I realized after Gonzalez's commen ts that I would never look at the bejeweled night sky as I had in the past. I used to see stars as being fungible, which is a legal term meaning one is just as good as the other. But now I understood why the vast ma jority of stars would be automatically ruled out as being capable of s upporting life-bearing planets. It would take a star with the highly unusual properties of ou r sun_ the right mass, the right light, the right composition, the ri ght distance, the right orbit, the right galaxy, the right location-to nurture living orga nisms on a circling planet. That makes our sun, and our planet, rare indeed. As much as I have been fascinated by the sun, I've also frequently stared in wonder at the other dominant celestial body in our sky-the m oon. Curious to find out whether this barren, rocky satellite contributes anything to its host pl anet-other than inspiration for poets and other romantics-I proceeded to turn our discussion toward lunar issues. OUR LIFE-SUPPORTING MOON Centuries ago, the dark patches on the moon-low-lying areas that had been flooded with basaltic lava-were thought to be oceans that provided life-giving water to its unseen population. They were called maria, Latin for \"seas.\" ; \" The name has stuck; to this day, for example, we still refer to Mare Tranquilitatis, or the Sea of Tranquility. Johannes Kepler, the seventeenth-century astronomer who fanned the flames of the Copernican Revolution, gazed at the moon and believed he discerned caves that were populated by moon people. He even wrote a book in which he fantasized about what their lives might be like. ; ' A century later, William Herschel, who ga ined fame by discovering Uranus, thought he made out cities, highways, and pyramids on the lunar landscape.\" As scientific knowledge grew, dreams of fi nding lunar civilizations dissipated. Everyone came to agree that the moon cannot support life. Yet surprising discoveries in recent years have shown the opposite to be true: the moon really does support life-ours! Scie ntific evidence confirms how this parched, airless satellite actually contributes in unexpect ed ways to creating a lush and stable environment a quarter of a million miles away on Earth. When I asked Gonzalez about how the moon help s support life on our planet, the first thing"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"he brought up was a discovery that only dates back to 1993. \"There was a remarkable finding th at the moon actually stabilizes th e tilt of the Earth's axis,\" he said. \"The tilt is responsible for our seasons . During the summer, in the northern hemisphere the north pole axis is pointed more toward the sun. Six months later, when the Earth is on the other side of the sun, then the south pole is more pointed toward the sun. With the Earth's tilt at 23.5 degrees, this gives us very mild seasons. So in a very real way, the stability of our climate is attributable to the moon.\" \"What would happen,\" I asked, \"i f the moon were not there?\" \"Then our tilt could swing wildly over a large range, resulting in major temperature swings. If our tilt were more like ninety degrees, the north pole would be exposed to the sun for six months while the south pole would be in darkness, then vice-ver sa. Instead, it varies by only about one and a half degrees-jus t a tiny variation, because the gravity from the moon's orbit keeps it stabilized. \"The moon's large size compared to its host pl anet is unique in the in ner solar system,\" he continued. \"Mercury and Venus have no moons . Mars has two tiny moons-probably captured asteroids-and they don't do anything to stabilize the axis of Mars. Its axis is pretty close to Earth's right now, but that's only by coincidence. It actually varies over a huge range. In fact, all three of these planets have chao tic variations in their tilt. \"The moon also helps in anot her crucial way, which is to increase our tides. The moon contributes sixty percent to the tides; the sun acco unts for the other forty percent. Tides serve an important role by flushing out nutrients from th e continents to the oceans, which keeps them more nutrient-rich than they otherwise would be. Scientists disc overed just a few years ago that the lunar tides also help to keep large-scale oc ean circulation going. That's important because the oceans carry a lot of heat, which is necessary to keep the temper ature of the higher latitudes relatively mild.\" I asked, \"What if the moon we re larger than it is?\" \"If it were more massive and in the same pl ace, the tides would be much too strong, which would create serious difficulties . You see, the moon is slowi ng down the Earth's rotation. The tides pull on the Earth and slow it down a little bit, while at the same time the moon moves out in its orbit. We can actually measure this. Astr onauts left mirrors on the moon and astronomers have been bouncing lasers off them since the early 1970s. They've documen ted that the moon is moving out in its orbit at 3.82 centimeters a year. \"If the moon were more massive, it would slow down the Earth much more. That would be a problem because if the days became too long, then you could have large te mperature differences between day and night.\" James Kasting, a professor of geosciences and meteorology at Pennsylvania State University, has confirmed that \"Earth's climatic stability is dependent to a large extent on the existence of the moon.\" Without the moon, he sai d, the Earth's tilt could \"vary chaotically from zero to eighty-five degrees on a time scale of tens of millions of years,\" with devastating results. To me, it was amazing enough that the moon \"just happens\" to be the right size and in the right place to help create a ha bitable environment for Earth. Ag ain, it was piling on more and more \"coincidences\" that were making it harder to believe mere chance could be responsible for our life-sustaining biosphere. But then Kasting made one more intriguing obs ervation that adds yet another mind-blowing improbability to already extraordinary circumst ances. \"The moon is now generally believed to have formed as a consequence of a glancing collision with a Mars-sized body during the later"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"stages of the Earth's formation,\" he said. \"If such moon-forming collisions are rare ... habitable planets might be equally rare.\" THE DANGERS OF A WATER WORLD Having explored the moon's contribution to th e Earth's life-support system, I decided it was time to focus on our planet itself. I had studie d enough geology to know that the Earth is more than just an undifferentiated spinning rock, but th at its interior is a dynamic and complex system eight thousand miles in diamet er, with a solid iron core surrounded by iron that has been rendered liquid by the heat. At its center, where the pressure is more than three million times greater than at the planet's surface, temperatur es soar to nine thousand degrees Fahrenheit. \"What,\" I said to Gonzalez, \"are some of the phe nomena on Earth that contribute to its ability to sustain life?\" \"First let's talk about the Earth's mass,\" Gonzalez said. \"A terrestrial planet must have a minimum mass to retain an atmo sphere. You need an atmosphere for the free exchange of the chemicals of life and to protect inhabitants from cosmic ra diation. And you need an oxygen-rich atmosphere to support big-brained creatures like humans. Earth's atmosphere is twenty percent oxygen-just right, it turns out. \"And the planet has to be a minimum size to keep the heat from its interior from being lost too quickly. It's the heat from its radioactive decaying interior that drives the critically important mantle convection inside the Earth. If Earth were smaller, like Mars, it would cool down too quickly; in fact, Mars cooled down and basically is dead.\" \"What if the Earth were a little more massive than it is?\" I asked. \"The bigger the planet, the higher the surface gr avity, and the less surface relief between the ocean basins and the mountains,\" he said. \"The rocks at the bases of mountains can only withstand so much weight before they fracture. The higher the surface gravity of a planet, the greater the pull of the gravity on the mountains, and the tendency would be toward creating a smooth sphere. \"Think what would happen if our planet were a smooth sphere. The Earth has a lot of water in its crust. The only reason we're not a water world right now is because we have continents and mountains to rise above it. If you were to smoot h out all the land, water would be at a depth of two kilometers. You would have a water wo rld-and a water world is a dead world.\" That perplexed me. \"If you need water for life, \" I said, \"why doesn't more water mean more life?\" Gonzalez replied, \"We have life on Earth because we have the energy-rich sunlit surface of the oceans, which is teeming with mineral nutri ents. Tides and weathering wash the nutrients from the continents into the oceans, where they feed organisms. In a water world, many of the life-essential minerals would si nk to the bottom. That's the basic problem. Besides, the salt concentration in a water world w ould be prohibitively high. Life ca n only tolerate a certain level of saltiness.\" \"Our oceans and seas are salty,\" I said. \"How does Earth manage to regulate this?\" \"We have large, marshy areas along some coasts . Because these are shallow, water comes in from the ocean and evaporates quickly, leaving salt behin d. So you get huge salt deposits accumulating on the continents, and the salt content of the ocean doesn't get out of control. But in a water world, eventually the excess salt would saturate the wa ter and settle to the bottom. This would create a super-saturated salt so lution that would be inhospitable to life.\" Even so, I said, some scientists have theorized that life might exist inside Jupiter's frozen"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"moon Europa, where a theoretical ocean might be located. \"It doesn't sound like you think life would be possible in an envi ronment like that,\" I said. \"No, I don't think so,\" he replied. \"I don't belie ve it would be habitable. There would be no way to regulate the salt, so I certainly don't imagine there ar e any dolphins swimming around in there.\" Mountains and continents, then, are crucial for a life-flourishin g planet. But where did they come from? I soon learned that they are partly the product of elaborate choreography involving radioactive elements and plate tectonics -absolutely essential ingredients for any planet to sustain a thriving biosphere. THE ENGINE OF THE EARTH Scientists over the last several decades have established the surprising centrality of plate tectonics, and the related continental drift, to the sustaining of life on Earth. Continental drift refers to the movement of a dozen or more massive plates in th e Earth's lithosphere, which is the outer, rigid shell of the planet. One crucial bypr oduct of plate tectonics is the development of mountain ranges, which are generally created over long periods of time as the plates collide and buckle. Scientists are finding that the importance of plate tectonics is difficult to overstate. \"It may be,\" said Ward and Brownlee in Rare Earth, \"that plate tectonics is the central requirement for life on a planet.\" 38 Interestingly, they added that \"of all th e planets and moons in our solar system, plate tectonics is found only on Earth.\" 39 In fact, any heavenly body would need oceans of water as a prerequisite to having plate tect onics, in order to lubricate and facilitate the movement of the plates. When I asked Gonzalez why plate tectonics is so crucial, he launched into describing an improbable series of highly coor dinated natural processes that le ft me amazed once more at how finely tuned our planet really is. \"Not only does plate tectonics help with the devel opment of continents and mountains, which prevent a water world, but it also drives the Eart h's carbon dioxide-rock cycle,\" he said. \"This is critical in regulating the envi ronment through the balancing of greenhouse gases and keeping the temperature of the planet at a livable level. \"You see, greenhouse gases, like ca rbon dioxide, absorb infrared e nergy and help warm the planet. So they're absolutely crucial. The problem is that their concentration in the atmosphere needs to be regulated as the sun slowly brighten s. Otherwise, the Earth would not be able to stabilize its surface temperature, which would be disastrous. \"Plate tectonics cycles fragments of the Eart h's crust-including limestone, which is made up of calcium, carbon dioxide, and oxygen a toms-down into the mantle. There, the planet's internal heat releases the carbon dioxide, which is then continually vented to the atmosphere through volcanoes. It's quite an elaborate process, but the end result is a ki nd of thermostat that keeps the greenhouse gases in balance and our surface temperature under control. \"What's driving plate tectonics is the inte rnal heat generated by radioactive isotopes- Potassium-40, Uranium-235, Uranium-238, Thorium-232. These elements deep inside the Earth were originally produced in supe rnovae, and their production in the galaxy is declining with time because the supernova rate is declining with time. That will limit the production of Earth-like planets in the future, because they won't genera te as much internal heat as the Earth does. \"This radioactive decay also helps drive the convection of the liquid iron surrounding the Earth's core, which results in an amazing phenom enon: the creation of a dynamo that actually"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"generates the planet's magnetic field. The magnetic field is crucial to life on Earth, because it shields us from low-energy cosmic rays. If we didn't have a magnetic shield, there would be more dangerous radiation reaching the atmosphe re. Also, solar wind part icles would directly interact with the upper atmosphe re, stripping it away, especially the molecules of hydrogen and oxygen from water. That would be bad news because water would be lost more quickly. \"Now, remember how I said that plate tect onics helps regulate gl obal temperatures by balancing greenhouse gases? Well, there's also another natural thermost at, called the Earth's albedo. Albedo refers to the proportion of sunlight a planet reflects. The Earth has an especially rich variety of albedo sources-oceans, polar ice caps, continenta l interiors, including deserts- which is good for regulating the climate. Whatev er light isn't reflected by Earth is absorbed, which means the surface gets heated. \"This is self-regulated through one of the Earth's natural feedback mechanisms. To give you an example, some marine algae produce dimethyl sulfide. This helps to build cloud condensation nuclei, or CCN, which are small particles in the atmosphere around which water can condense to form cloud droplets. \"If the ocean gets too warm, then this al gae reproduce more quick ly and release more dimethyl sulfide, which leads to a greater c oncentration of CCN and a higher albedo for the marine stratus clouds. Higher cloud albedo, in tur n, cools the ocean below, which then reduces the rate at which the alga e reproduce. So this provid es a natural thermostat. 40 \"On the other hand, Mars lacks oceans, so it doesn't have this albe do component. It only has deserts, small polar caps, and ve ry thin, occasional clouds. So Mars is far less capable of adjusting its albedo as its more eccentric orbit takes it closer and then further from the sun. That's one of the reasons why it experiences larger temperature swings than Earth.\" Giant plates of shifting rock that preca riously balance greenhouse gases; decaying radioactive isotopes acting as a life-sustainin g underground furnace; an internal dynamo that generates a magnetic field which deflects cosmic dangers; precision feedback loops that unite biology and meteorology-I had to pause and marvel at the complex and interconnected processes that orchestrate our planet's environment. And that was just the beginning. I knew Gonzal ez could go on and on a bout scores of other fine-tuned phenomena. Among them are the elabor ate physical processes that resulted in valuable ores being deposited near the planet's surface, enabling them to be efficiently mined for our technological development. Geologist George Brimhall of the University of California at Berkeley has observed: The creation of ores and their placement cl ose to the Earth's surface are the result of much more than simple geologic chance. Only an exact series of physical and chemical events, occurring in the right environment a nd sequence and followed by certain climatic conditions, can give rise to a high concentr ation of these compounds so crucial to the development of civilization and technology. 41 When I took this together with all of the various \"serendipitous\" circumstances involving our privileged location in the universe, I was left without a vocabulary to describe my sense of wonder. The suggestion that all of this was base d on fortuitous chance had become absurd to me. The tell-tale signs of design are evident from the far reaches of the Milky Way down to the inner core of our planet. And yet there was more-a whole new dimension of evidence that suggests this astounding world was created, in part, so we coul d have the adventur e of exploring it. "},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"THE POWER OF AN ECLIPSE The story begins with an unabashed love for so lar and lunar eclipses that helped drive a young Guillermo Gonzalez into a life-long study of stellar mysteries. Mesmerized by the partial eclipses he had w itnessed as an amateur astronomer, Gonzalez longed to see the zenith of them a ll: a total eclipse of the sun, wh ere the moon just barely covers the sun's photosphere. He finally got his chance in 1995. Aware that an eclipse was going to occur on October 24 of that year, he scheduled his research so he could witness the event in northern India, one of the few places where it was going to be fully visible. \"One thing about eclipses,\" he to ld me, \"is that a seasoned as tronomer could be standing next to someone from a remote village, and they woul d both have tears in thei r eyes. They're both in awe. At my eclipse camp, as soon as the total phase of the eclipse ended, when you could see the sun's beautiful corona and it was relatively dark, people spontaneous ly applauded as if rewarding a show. It was just so beautiful!\" Gonzalez photographed the eclipse and made sc ientific measurements. But he wasn't done. His mind wouldn't let go of an insight: eclipses are better viewed on Earth than they would be from any other planet in our solar system. \"There's a striking convergence of rare prope rties that allow people on Earth to witness perfect solar eclipses,\" he said. \"There's no law of physics that would necessitate this. In fact, of the nine planets with their more than sixty-three moons in our solar system, the Earth's surface is the best place where observers can witness a total solar eclipse, and that 's only possible for the 'near-term' future. 42 \"What's really amazing is that total eclipses ar e possible because the sun is four hundred times larger than the moon, but it's also four hundred times further away. It's that incredible coincidence that creates a perfect match. Because of this configuration, and because the Earth is the innermost planet with a moon, observers on Earth can discern finer details in the sun's chromosphere and corona than from any other pl anet, which makes these eclipses scientifically rich. \"What intrigued me,\" he said, \"was that the very time and place where perfect solar eclipses appear in our unive rse also correspond s to the one time and place where there are observers to see them.\" That \"coincidence\" was so fascinating to me th at I asked him to repeat his last statement before we continued. After he did, he added: \"W hat's more, perfect solar eclipses have resulted in important scientific discoveries that would have been difficult if not impossible elsewhere, where eclipses don't happen.\" \"What discoveries?\" I asked. \"I'll give you just three examples,\" he said. \"First, perfect solar eclipses helped us learn about the nature of stars. Using spectrosc opes, astronomers learned how the sun's color spectrum is produced, and that data helped them later interpret the spectra of distant stars. \"Second, a perfect solar eclipse in 1919 helped two teams of astronomers confirm the fact that gravity bends light, which was a prediction of Einstein's gene ral theory of relativity. That test was only possible during a total solar eclipse, and it led to general acceptance of Einstein's theory. \"Third, perfect eclipses provide d a historical record that has enabled astronomers to calculate the change in the Earth's rotation over the past several thousand years. This enabled us to put ancient calendars on our modem cale ndar system, which was very significant.\" Richards, who had been listening intently, spoke up. \"What's mysterious,\" he said, \"is that the"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"same conditions that give us a habitable planet al so make our location so wonderful for scientific measurement and discovery. So we say there's a correlation between habitability and measurability. \"Not only does the specific configuration of the Earth, sun, and moon allow for perfect eclipses, but that same configuration is also vital to sustai ning life on Earth. We've already discussed how the size and location of the moon stabilizes our ti lt and increases our tides, and how the size of the sun and our distan ce from it also make life possible here. \"Our main point,\" he concluded, \"is that ther e's no obvious reason to assume that the very same rare properties that allow for our existenc e would also provide the best overall setting to make discoveries about the world around us. In f act, we believe that the conditions for making scientific discoveries on Earth are so fine-tuned that you would n eed a great amount of faith to attribute them to mere chance.\" 1ABITABILITY AND MEASURABILITY Prompted by the study of perfect solar eclips es, Gonzalez and Richards began to investigate the incredible convergence of habitability and m easurability in scores of other settings. They came up with a wide range of examples that merely served to amplify their amazement. \"For example,\" said Gonzalez, \"not only do we inhabit a location in the Milky Way that's fortuitously optimal for life, but our location also happens to provide us with the best overall platform for making a diverse range of disc overies for astronomers and cosmologists. Our location away from the galaxy's center and in th e flat plane of the di sk provides us with a particularly privileged vantage point for observing both nearby and distant stars. \"We're also in an excellent position to dete ct the cosmic background radiation, which is critically important because it helped us rea lize our universe had a beginning in the Big Bang. The background radiation contains invaluable information about the properties of the universe when it was only about three hundred thousand year s old. There's no other way of getting that data. And if we were elsewhere in the galaxy, our ability to detect it would have been greatly hindered.\" Richards offered a few other illustrations. \"T he moon stabilizes the Earth's tilt, which gives us a livable climate-and it also consistently pres erves the deep snow deposits in the polar regions. These deposits are a tremendously valuable da ta recorder for scientists,\" he said. \"By taking core samples from the ice, resear chers can gather data going back hundreds of thousands of years. Ice cores can tell us about the history of snowfall, temperatures, winds near the polar regions, and the amount of volcanic dust, methane, and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. They record the sunspot cycle throu gh variations in the conc entration of beryllium- 10. They even record the temporary weakening of the Earth's magnetic field forty thousand years ago. In 1979, scientists identified a tentative link between nitrate spikes in an Antarctic ice core with nearby supernovae. By taking deeper cores, it might be possible to catalog all nearby supernovae of the last few hundred thousand years-something that would be otherwise impossible.\" Another example of the strange correlation between habitabilit y and measurability, Richards said, is the clarity of our atmospher e . \"The metabolisms of higher organisms require from ten to twenty percent oxygen in the atmosphere-which is also the amount needed to facilitate fire, allowing for the development of technology,\" Richard s said. 43 \"But it just so happens that the very composition of our atmosphere also gives it transparency, which it wouldn't have if it were rich in carbon-containing atoms, like methane. And a transparent atmosphere allows the science"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"of astronomy and cosmology to flourish.\" \"Wait a second,\" I said. \"Doesn't the water vapo r in our atmosphere ca use cloudiness that can hinder astronomy? That's why putting a telescope in space has been such a breakthrough.\" \"Actually, astronomers prefer a partly cloudy atmo sphere to one that's completely cloudy or always windy and dusty,\" Gonzalez said. \"Bes ides, we're not saying that every condition of measurability is uniquely and individually optimized on Earth. Our argument depends on what's called an optimal negotiation of competing conditions. \"As Henry Petroski said in his book Invention by Design, `All design involves conflicting objectives and hence compromise, and the best desi gns will always be t hose that come up with the best compromise.'`'' To come up with discoveries in a wide range of sc ientific disciplines, our environment must be a good compromise of competing factors-and we find that it is.\" Another interesting connection between habita bility and measurability involves plate tectonics. As Gonzalez and Richards explained ear lier, plate tectonics is essential to having a livable planet. One byproduc t of the movement of these crusta l plates is earthquakes, which, in turn, have provided scientists with research data that would otherwise be difficult to obtain. \"Thousands of seismographs all over the plan et have measured earthquakes through the years,\" Richards said. \"In the past few decades, sc ientists have been able to use that data to produce a threedimensional map of the st ructure of the Earth's interior.\" Over and over again, he said, the extraord inary conditions that create a hospitable environment on Earth also happen to make our planet strangely well -suited for viewing, analyzing, and understand ing the universe. \"Is that merely some sort of cosmic quirk?\" Richards asked. \"Are we just lucky? I think wisdom entails the ability to discern the differe nce between mere coinci dence and a meaningful pattern. We have more than a coincidence here. Much more.\" THE TRILEMMA OF LIFE When trying to explain the existence of life, said Gonzalez and Richar ds, we face a trilemma. One possibility is that some natural n ecessity, like the laws of physics, inexorably leads to life. Advocates of SETI-the Search fo r Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence- like that possibility. However, more and more scientific discoveries are showin g how incredibly improbable it is to marshal the right conditions for life. Many scientists are conc luding that intelligent life is, at minimum, far rarer than was once thought. In fact, it may very well be unique to Earth. The second possible explanation is chance: life is a fluke. Create enough planets circling enough stars and the odds say at least one of them will have life. Brownlee and Ward, who wrote Rare Earth, seem to gravitate toward this explanation. But there's also a third possibility: life was created. After studying all of the extraordinarily rare circumstances that have c ontributed to life on Earth, and then overlaying the amazing way in which these conditions also open th e door to scientific discoverie s, Gonzalez and Richards have landed in this camp. \"To find that we have a univers e where the very places where we find observers are also the very best overall places for observing- that's surprising,\" Richards said. \"I see desi gn not just in the rarity of life in the universe, but also in this very pattern of habitability and measurability.\" I turned toward Gonzalez. \"What's your conclusion?\" I asked. \"My conclusion, frankly, is that the universe was designed for observers living in places where they can make scientific discoveries,\" he replied. \"There may be other purposes to the universe, but at least we know that sc ientific discovery was one of them.\""},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Ever the theologian, Richards jumped back in. \"In the Christian tradit ion, this is quite at home,\" he said. \"Christians have always believed that God testif ies to his existence through the book of nature and the book of Script ure. In the nineteenth century, science effectiv ely closed the book of nature. But now, new scientific discoveries are reopening it.\" \"But if the universe was designed with us in mind, why is it so incredibly vast?\" I asked. \"There's a lot of empty space out there. Isn't that wasteful and unnecessary?\" \"Because the universe was designed for disc overy, we need something to discover,\" Richards replied. \"The universe is vast and we're small, but we have access to it. That's what is amazing. We can see background radiat ion that has come from more than ten billion light years away.\" \"Plus,\" added Gonzalez, \"we needed supernova e to build up the heavy elements so life- bearing planets could develop. And one particular type of supernovae is incredibly useful as a `standard candle.' Type la supernovae have 'calibratable liminosities' so we can use them to determine distances and to probe the expansion history of the universe. So, again, we see the connection between habitability and measurability.\" Richards made one other interesting obser vation. \"Darwin once comp lained that pollen couldn't have been designed. After all, he sa id, look at the waste! Millions upon millions of particles are produced, but ver y, very few are used in the development of flowers. \"However, what he didn't realize was that pollen is one of the most useful tools we have in the scientific exploratio n of the past, in part , because it can be date d through Carbon 14. When we find pollen in lake sediments and ice cores, we can use it to gauge how old the layered deposits are and what the ancient climate was like. \"Darwin only looked at pollen from a biological standpoint; when we look at the big picture, we see it has another use he never anticipated. Pe rhaps the same is true in many other instances throughout the universe.\" A CHERISHED GROUP OF CREATURES I pushed my chair back from the table as if I ha d just consumed a hearty meal. In a sense, I had. Gonzalez and Richards had served me a re markable feast-fact upon fact, evidence upon evidence, discovery upon discovery that compelled an incred ible conclusion. As I sat there and digested the data, my mind turned to the book God and the Astronomers, which I had been reading on the airplane just prior to our interview. In one chapter, John A. O'Keef e describes how he went away to school at the ag e of fourteen and began to get into arguments with his roommate about God. These encounters turned him toward astronomy, a field where scientists were beginning to find new and exciting evidence about the possibility of a Creator. After earning degrees from Harvard and the University of Chicago, O'Keefe went on to become a renowned astronomer and pioneer in space research. The late Eugene Shoemaker called him \"the godfather of astrogeology.\" He was awarded many honors, including the Goddard Space Flight Center's highest award, and is credited with numerous breakthrough discoveries in his scientific research at NASA. 45 It was the discoveries of astronomy that bo lstered O'Keefe's faith in God. He once ran calculations estimating th e likelihood of the right c onditions for life existing elsewhere. He concluded that if his assumptions were correc t, then based on the mathematical probabilities \"only one planet in the universe is likely to be ar intelligent life. We know of one-the Earth-but it is not certain that there are many ot hers, and perhaps there are no others.\" 46"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"O'Keefe said he would have no theological pr oblem if, indeed, other civilizations existed. That's the position of many Christians. 47 God certainly could have created other life-populated planets that the Bible doesn't reveal. But it was the sheer improbability of the coincidences that conspired to create life on Earth th at led O'Keefe to this conclusion: We are, by astronomical standards, a pampered , cossetted, cherished group of creatures; our Darwinian claim to have done it all oursel ves is as ridiculous and as charming as a baby's brave efforts to stand on its own feet and refuse his mother', hand. If the universe had not been made with the most exacting precision we could never have come into existence. It is m) view that these circumstances indicate the universe was create6 for man to live in. 48 And for humankind to explore. The findings of Gonzalez and Richards that the cosmos was designed for discovery have added a compelling new dimension to the evidence for a Creator. And frankly, their analysis makes sense. If God so precisely and caref ully and lovingly and amazi ngly constructed a mind-boggling habitat for his creatures, then it would be natura l for him to want them to explore it, to measure it, to investigate it, to appreciate it, to be insp ired by it-and ultimately, and most importantly, to find him through it.

The en tire cell can be viewed as a factory that contains an elaborate network of interlocking assembly lines, each of which is composed of a set of large protein machines.... Why do we call [them] machines? Precisely because, like machines invented by humans to deal efficiently with the macroscopic world, these protein assemblies contain highly coordinated moving parts. Bruce Alberts, President, National Academy of Sciences We should reject, as a matter of principle, the substitution of inte lligent design for the dialogue of chance and necessity; but we must concede that there are presently no detailed Darwinian accounts of the evolution of any biochemical system, only a variety of wishful speculations. Biochemist Franklin M. Harold Michael Behe was taught in parochial school that God had set up the universe, knew what was going to happen, and intended for life to come into existence, but from our perspective the entire process unfolded through Darwinian evolu tion. And that pretty much satisfied the young Behe. Later as a student in bioche mistry, when Behe would enc ounter enormously complicated biological systems, his response was to scratch his head and say, \"Gee, I wonder how evolution created that? Well, somebody must know!\" He always moved on, assuming someone did. Then one day, while doing post-doctorate res earch on DNA at the National Institutes of Health, he and a colleague were pondering what it would take fo r life to begin by naturalistic processes. As they enumerated the components that would be needed-prote ins, a genetic code, a membrane, and so on-they looked at each othe r and said, \"Naaaaahhhhhh!\" They knew there was no way life could have sprung into existence unaided. Seeds of skep ticism were planted. Subsequently, he read genetici st Michael Denton's groundbreaking book Evolution: A Theory in Crisis. For the first time, Behe was exposed to a well-reasoned scientific critique of"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Darwinismand he was astounded. Until then, he only knew of \"religious nuts\" who doubted Darwin. Now, here was a thoughtful, agnostic scientist who was powe rfully challenging whether Darwin's mechanism of natural selec tion could really explain how life started and developed through the ages. Spurred on by Denton's book, Behe began scouring the scientific literature in search of the detailed Darwinian explanations he had always assumed were there. Time after time, he found scientists describing complex, interlocking biological systems and basically saying, \"Isn't it wonderful how natural selecti on put this together?\" The how was always missing. That's when Behe realized that as a biochemi st, he was perfectly situated to investigate whether the evidence points toward Darwinism or God as the source for living organisms. After all, life is essentially a molecular phenomenon. If Darwinian evolution is going to work, it has to succeed at the microscopic level of amino acids, proteins, and DNA. On th e other hand, if there really was a designer of the world, then his fingerprints were going to be all over the cell. And the cell is Behe's world-an incredible, in tricate, Lilliputian world where a typical cell takes ten million million atoms to build. One scientist described a single-cell organism as a high- tech factory, complete with artificial languages and their decoding system s, memory banks for information storage and retrieval, elegant control systems regulat ing the automated assembly of parts and components, error fail-safe and proof-reading devices utilized for quality control, assembly processes involving the principle of prefab rication and modular c onstruction ... [and] a capacity not equaled in any of our own most ad vanced machines, for it would be capable of replicating its entire structure within a matter of a few hours. Shaking off his preconceptions as best he c ould, Behe began to scrutinize the molecular evidence with new eyes. Ultimately, he would summarize his stunning conclusions in what the National Review would call one of the most important non-fiction books of the twentieth century. INTERVIEW #6: MICHAEL J. BEHE, PHD Lehigh University's \"Mountaintop Campus,\" a seventy-two-acre, e ight-building research complex overlooking the hardscrabb le city of Bethlehem, Pennsyl vania, was littered with brown, brittle leaves when I arrived one autumn afternoon in my search for Michael Behe. After parking in front of Iacocca Hall, a mode rn, tan-and-green glass building, I walked up to the second floor. I strolled down a long hallway with laboratorie s on both sides-the Complex Carbohydrate Research Lab, the Core Chroma tography/Electrophoresis Lab, the Molecular Microbiology Research Lab, the Neuroendocrinology Lab, the Core DNA Lab, and the ominous- sounding Virology Lab, with an orange biohazard sign plastered on its door. The hallway's wall featured scintillating readi ng-an oversized reprod uction of a technical article by two Lehigh scientists , asking the provocative question: \"How Does Testosterone Affect Hippocampal Plasticity in Black-Capped Chickadees?\" I knocked on the door of a nondescript office an d was greeted cheerfull y by Behe, dressed in blue jeans and a lumberjack shirt. He's enthusia stic, energetic, and enga ging, with a quick smile and a crackling sense of humor. He always se ems to be moving; even when perched on his swivel chair, he would roll back and forth ever so slightly. Wiry and balding, with wispy gray hair, a beard, and round glasses, he has a gentle and self-effacing manner that tends to put vis- itors at ease."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Behe credits his casual manner to being the father of eight (at th e time, going on nine) children, who keep him from taki ng himself too seriously. He laugh ed when I asked if he had any hobbies. \"Mostly, I drive kids places,\" he said. Behe grew up on the other side of Pennsylvania. He received a degree in chemistry with honors from Drexel University and a doctorate in biochemistry at the University of Pennsylvania. After post-doctorate research at the University of Pennsylvania and the National Institutes of Health, he join ed Lehigh's faculty in 1985. He also has served on the Molecular Biochemistry Review Panel of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences at the National Science Foundation. He has authored forty articles for such scientific journals as DNA Sequence, The Journal of Molecular Biology, Nucleic Acids Research, Biop olymers, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, Biophysics, and Biochemistry. He has lectured at the Mayo Clinic and dozens of schools, including Yale, Carnegie-Mellon, th e University of Aberdeen, Temple, Colgate, Notre Dame, and Princeton. He is a member of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, the Society for Molecular Biology and Evol ution, and other professional organizations. Behe has contributed to several books, including Mere Creation, Signs of Intelligence, and Creation and Evolution. He was catapulted into the national spotlight, however, by his enigmatically titled and award-winning best-seller, Darwin's Black Box. According to David Berlinski, author of A Tour of the Calculus, Behe's book \"makes an overwhelming case against Darwin on the biochemical level\" through an argument \"of great originality, elegance, and intellectual power.\" A dded Berlinski: \"No one has done this before.\" 4 In fact, it was this book that lured me to Lehigh. I knew th at Behe's theories could provide strong support for the idea that a designer create d the tiny but complex molecular machines that drive the cellular world-that is, if his arguments could withstand the objections of skeptical Darwinists. PEERING INSIDE THE BLACK BOX The \"black box\" in the title of Behe's book is a term scientists use when describing a system or machine that they find interesting but they don't know how it works. As an example, Behe gestured toward the Dell computer on his desk. \"A computer is a black box for most people,\" he explained. \"You type on the keyboard and you can do word processing or play electronic games, but most of us don't have the foggiest id ea of how the computer actually works.\" \"And to Darwin, the cell was a black box,\" I commented. \"That's right,\" he replied. \"In Darwin's day, sc ientists could see the cell under a microscope, but it looked like a little glob of Jello, with a dark spot as the nucleus. The cell could do interesting thingsit could divide, it could move around-but they didn't know how it did anything.\" \"There must have been speculation,\" I said. \"Of course,\" Behe said. \"Electricity was a big deal back then, and some believed that all you had to do was to zap some gelatinous material and it would come aliv e. Most scientists speculated that the deeper they delved into the cell, the more simplicity they would find. But the opposite happened. \"Now we've probed to the bottom of life, so to speak-we're at the level of molecules-and there's complexity all the way down. We've lear ned the cell is horrendously complicated, and that it's actually run by micromachines of the right shape, the right strength, and the right interactions. The existence of these machines ch allenges a test that Darwin himself provided.\""},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"\"A test?\" I asked. \"Darwin said in his Origin of Species, `If it could be demonstrat ed that any complex organ existed which could not possi bly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.'' And that was the basis for my concept of irreducible complexity. \"You see, a system or device is irreducibly complex if it has a number of different components that all work together to accomplish the task of the system, and if you were to remove one of the components, the system woul d no longer function. An irreducibly complex system is highly unlikely to be built piece-by -piece through Darwinian processes, because the system has to be fully present in order for it to function. The illustration I like to use is a mousetrap.\" I chuckled. \"Do you have problems with mice at your house?\" \"Actually, yes, we do,\" he said with a laugh. \"B ut a mousetrap has turned out to be a great example.\" He stood and walked over to a filing cabinet , removing a run-of-the-mill mousetrap and putting it down on the desk next to me. \"You can see the interdependence of the parts for yourself,\" he said, pointing to each component as he described them. \"First, there's a flat wooden platform to whic h the other parts are attached. Second, there's a metal hammer, which does the job of crushing th e mouse. Third, there's a spring with extended ends to press against the platform and the hamm er when the trap is charged. Fourth, there's a catch that releases when a mous e applies a slight bit of pressure. And, fifth, there's a metal bar that connects to the catch and holds the hammer back when the trap is charged. \"Now, if you take away any of these parts-the spring or th e holding bar or whatever-then it's not like the mousetrap becomes half as efficient as it used to be or it only catches half as many mice. Instead, it doesn't catch any mice. It's broken. It doesn't work at all.\" He pointed down at the trap again. \"And notice that you don't just need to have these five parts, but they also have to be matched to eac h other and have the right spatial relationship to each other. See-the parts are st apled in the right place. An intelligent agent does that for a mousetrap. But in the cell, who te lls the parts where they should go? Who staples them together? Nobody-they have to do it on their own. You have to have the information resident in the system to tell the components to get together in the right orie ntation, otherwise it's useless.\" Behe sat back down. \"So the mousetrap doe s a good job of illustrating how irreducibly complex biological systems defy a Darwinian explanation,\" he continued. \"Evolution can't produce an irreducibly complex biological machin e suddenly, all at once, because it's much too complicated. The odds against that would be prohibitive. And you can't produce it directly by numerous, successive, slight modifications of a precursor system, because any precursor system would be missing a part and cons equently couldn't function. There would be no reason for it to exist. And natural selection chooses systems that are already working.\" I studied the mousetrap. \"You said an irre ducibly complex system can't be produced directly by numerous, successive, slight modifications,\" I said. \"Does that mean there couldn't be an indirect route?\" Behe shook his head. \"You can't absolutely rule out a ll theoretical possibilities of a gradual, circuitous route,\" he sa id. \"But the more complex the interacting system, the far less likely an indirect route can account for it. And as we discover more and more of these irreducibly complex biological systems, we can be more and more c onfident that we've met Darwin's criterion of failure.\""},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"I asked, \"Are there a lot of different kinds of biological machines at the cellular level?\" \"Life is actually based on molecular machines,\" he replied. \"They haul cargo from one place in the cell to another; they turn cellular switc hes on and off; they act as pulleys and cables; electrical machines let current flow through nerves; manuf acturing machines build other machines; solar-powered machines capture the energy from light and store it in chemicals. Molecular machinery lets cells move, reproduce, and process food. In fact, ev ery part of the cell's function is controlled by comple x, highly calibrated machines.\" Behe motioned toward the mousetrap. \"And if the creation of a simple device like this requires intelligent design,\" he said, \"then we have to ask, `What about the finely tuned machines of the cellular world?' If evolution can't adequately explain them, then scientists should be free to consider other alternatives.\" Before I began investigating that issue any further, though, I wa nted to stay focused a while longer on Behe's whimsical use of the mousetrap to illustrate irreducible complexity. Ever since Darwin's Black Box was published, the lowly rodent-catch er has become something of a new icon in the debate over evoluti on versus design. As such, it has been pelted by opposition from Darwinists-and I needed to know if Behe could fend off the best challenges. MESSING WITH THE MOUSETRAP \"Your mousetrap has generated quite a bit of controversy,\" I began. \"For instance, John McDonald of the University of Delaware said mousetraps can work well with fewer parts than yours-and he even drew a picture of a trap that 's simpler than the one you drew. Doesn't this undermine your point that your mous etrap is irreducibly complex?\" \"No, not a bit,\" he said with a good-natured smile. \"I agree there are mousetraps with fewer parts than mine. As a matter of fact, I said so in my book! I said you can just prop open a box with a stick, or you can use a gl ue trap, or you can dig a hole fo r the mouse to fall into, or you can do any number of things. \"The point of irreducible comple xity is not that one can't make some other system that could work in a different way with fewe r parts. The point is that the trap we're consid ering right now needs all of its parts to function. The challenge to Darwinian gradua lism is to get to my trap by means of numerous, successive, slight modificat ions. You can't do it. Besides, you're using your intelligence as you try. Remember, the audacious clai m of Darwinian evolution is that it can put together complex systems with no intelligence at all.\" Behe's simple explanation seemed sufficient to defeat McDonald's critique But there was a stronger challenge to consider. I reached down into my briefcase and re moved a copy of Natural History magazine. \"Kenneth Miller of Brown University has anothe r objection to your trap,\" I said. Then I read him Miller's comments: Take away two parts (the catch and the meta l bar), and you may not have a mousetrap but you do have a three-part machine that makes a fu lly functional tie clip or paper clip. Take away the spring, and you have a two-part key chain. The catch of some mousetraps could be used as a fishhook, and the wooden base as a paperweight; useful a pplications of other parts include everything from toothpicks to nutcrackers and clipboard holders . The point, which science has long understood, is that bits and pieces of supposedly irreducibly complex machines may have differe nt-but still useful-functions.' \"That's a strong point,\" I said. \"Maybe an irreducibly complex system could develop gradually over time, because each of its compone nts could have another function that natural"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"selection would preserve on the way towa rd developing a more complex machine.\" \"That's an interesting argument,\" he said. I leaned forward. \"Doesn't this dismantle your case?\" I asked. Behe didn't flinch. \"The problem,\" he replied, \"is that it's not an ar gument against anything I’ve ever said. In my book, I explicitly point ou t that some of the components of biochemical machines can have other functions. But the issue remains-can you use numerous, slight, successive modifications to get from t hose other functions to where we are? \"Some of this objection seems a bit silly. Could a component of a mousetrap function as a paperweight? Well, what do you need to be a pape rweight? You need mass. You need to exist. An elephant, or my computer, or a stic k can be a paperweight. But suppose you go buy a paperweight. What would it look like? Most of them are nondescri pt, roundish things. None of them look anything like a precursor to a mouset rap. Besides, look at what he's doing: he's starting from the finished product-the mousetra p-and disassembling it and moving a few things around to use them for other purposes. Again, that's intelligent design! \"The question for evolution is not whether yo u can take a mousetrap and use its parts for something else; it's whether you can start with something else and make it into a mousetrap. The problem for evolutionists is to start with a less complex system and build a more complex system. Even if every component could theoretically have a useful function prior to its assembly into the mousetrap, you'd still have the problem of how the mousetrap becomes assembled.\" \"Explain further,\" I said. \"When people put together a m ousetrap, they have the disassembled components in different drawers or something, and they grab one from each drawer and put it together. But in the cell, there's nobody there to do that. \"In molecular machines, components have portions of their shape that are complementary to each other, so they connect with each other in the right way. A positive charge can attract a negative charge, and an oily regi on can attract another o ily region. So if we use the mousetrap as an analogy, one end of the spring would have to have a certain shape or magnetism that just happened to attract and fit with a nother component of the trap. They'd all have to f it together that way until you had the whole trap assembled by itself. \"In other words, if you just had the component s themselves without th e ability to bring the other pieces into position, you'd be far from having a functioning mousetrap. Nobody ever addresses this problem in the evolutionary lite rature. If you do any calculations about how likely this could occur by itself, you find it's very im probable. Even with small machines, you wouldn't expect them to self-assemble during the entire life time of the earth. That's a severe problem that evolutionists don't like to address.\" THE AMAZING, MOVING CILIUM The mousetrap emerged unscathed. But of course, it was only intended to be an illustration to help people understand irreducibly complex cellu lar systems. I decided to press forward by asking about some specific examples of molecula r machines to see whether they could have developed by the step-by-step evolutionary pr ocess envisioned by Darwin. When I asked Behe for a specimen of irreducible comple xity, he quickly cited the cilium. \"Cilia are whiplike hairs on the surface of cells. If the cell is stationary, the cilia move fluid across the cell's surface. For inst ance,\" he said, pointing toward my throat, \"you've got cilia lining your respiratory tract. Ever y cell has about two hundred of them, and they beat in syn- chrony in order to sweep mucus toward your throat for elimina tion. That's how your body expels"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"little foreign particles that you acci dentally inhale. But cilia also ha ve another function: if the cell is mobile, the cilia can row it through a fluid. Sperm cells would be an example; they're pro- pelled forward by the rowing action of cilia.\" \"That sounds fairly simple,\" I remarked. \"That's what scientists used to think when they examined cilia under a light microscope. They just looked like little hair s. But now that we have electr on microscopes, we've found that cilia are, in fact, quite compli cated molecular machines. Think about it: most hairs don't beat back and forth. What enables cilia to do this? Well, it turns out a cilium is made up of about two hundred protein parts.\" \"How does it function?\" He smiled. \"I'll try to keep this basic,\" he said. \"There are nine pairs of microtubules, which are long, thin, flexible rods, which encircle tw o single microtubules. The outer microtubules are connected to each other by what are called ne xin linkers. And each microtubule has a motor protein called dynein. The motor protein attaches to one microtubule and has an arm that reaches over, grabs the other one, and pushes it down. So the two rods start to slide lengthwise with respect to each other. As they start to slide, the nexin linkers, which were originally like loose rope, get stretched and become taut. As the dynein pushes farther and farther, it starts to bend the apparatus; then it pushes the other way and be nds it back. That's how you get the rowing motion of the cilium. \"That doesn't begin to do justice to the complex ity of the cilium. But my point is that these three parts-the rods, linkers, and motors-are nece ssary to convert a sliding motion into a bending motion so the cilium can move. If it weren't for the linkers, everything would fall apart when the sliding motion began. If it weren't for the motor pr otein, it wouldn't move at all. If it weren't for the rods, there would be nothing to move. So like the mousetrap, the cilium is irreducibly complex.\" \"Why can't Darwinian evol ution account for that?\" \"You only get the motion of the cilium when you've got everything together. None of the individual parts can do the trick by themselves. You need them all in place. For evolution to account for that, you would have to imagine ho w this could develop gradually-but nobody has been able to do that.\" I ventured a possibility. \"Maybe these three components were be ing used for other purposes in the cell and eventually came together fo r this new function,\" I said. \"For instance, microtubules look a bit like girder s. Maybe they were used in the structure of primitive cells. Or maybe they formed the cellular highways along wh ich the motor proteins moved material within the cell.\" Belie didn't look impressed. \"A motor protein th at has been transpor ting cargo along a cellular highway might not have the strength necessary to push two microtubules relative to each other,\" he replied. \"A nexin linker would have to be exactly the right size before it was useful at all. Creating the cilium inside the cel l would be counterproductive; it would need to extend from the cell. The necessary compone nts would have to come together at the right place at the right time, even assuming they were all pre-existing in the cell.\" \"Isn't it possible that they might all come together by chance?\" I asked. \"It's extraordinarily improbable,\" he replied. \"Let me illustrate it for you. Say there are ten thousand proteins in a cell. Now, imagine you live in a town of ten thousand people, and everyone goes to the county fair at the same tim e. Just for fun, everyone is wearing blindfolds and is not allowed to speak. There are two other people named Lee, and your job is to link hands"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"with them. What are the odds that you could go grab two people at rando m and create a link of Lees? Pretty slim. In fact, it gets worse. In the cell, the mutation rate is extremely low. In our analogy, that would mean you coul d only change partners at th e county fair one time a year. \"So you link with two other people -sorry, they're not the other Lees. Next year, you link with two other people. Sorry, no Lees again. How long would it take you to li nk with the other Lees? A very, very long time-and the same is true in the ce ll. It would take an enormous amount of time-a prohibitive amount of time-even to ge t three proteins together. \"To make it even more difficult, a recent study in Science magazine found that half the proteins in a simple yeast cell don't function al one, but they function as complexes of half a dozen proteins or more. Up to fi fty proteins are stuck together li ke cogs in a machine. Of the other fifty percent, most are in complexes of thre e or four. Very few work as single, Lone Ranger proteins. So this is a huge problem not only in cilia but in other cells too.\" \"Some scientists have pointed out that there ar e examples of other cilia that don't have some of the parts that you contend are essential,\" I said. \"One said, `In nature, we can find scores of cilia lacking one or more of the components supposedly essential to the function of the apparatus.' Doesn't the existence of simpler cilia refute your contention that they are irreducibly complex?\" \"If you could point to a series of less complex structures that progress from one to the other in order to create the cilia I've described, then, yes, that would refute me. But that isn't the case,\" he said. \"What the critics say is that you can take away one of the several microtubules and the cilium would still function. That's fine. You s till need all the basic components-microtubules, nexin, and dynein. ' \"Let me give you an analogy. Some big mousetra ps-actually, they re rat traps-have double springs to make them stronger. You can take one spring away and it would still work to a degree. In a sense, the second spring is a redundant component. The cilium is the same way; it's got some redundant components. You can take one of the microtubules away and it will still function, though maybe not as well. \"But evolution does not start w ith the completed trap or completed cilium and take parts away; it has to build things up from the bottom. And all cilia have the th ree critical components that I've mentioned. There have been experiments where scientists have removed one of the three and the cilium doesn't work. It's broken-just like you'd expect it to be, since it's an irreducibly complex machine.\" THE WORLD'S MOST EFFICIENT MOTOR As amazing as the cilium is, I was even more fascinated by another biological machine for propelling cells-the bacterial flagellum. \"While cilia act like oars to move cells, it was discovered in 1973 that the flagellum performs lik e a rotary propeller,\" Behe explained. \"Only bacteria have them.\" \"How does it work?\" I asked. \"Extremely efficiently,\" he said. \"Just pi cture an outboard motor on a boat and you get a pretty good idea of how the flagellum functions, onl y the flagellum is far more incredible. The flagellum's propeller is long and whiplike, made out of a protein called flagellin. This is attached to a drive shaft by hook protein, which acts as a uni versal joint, allowing the propeller and drive shaft to rotate freely. Several types of proteins act as bushing material to allow the drive shaft to penetrate the bacterial wall and attach to the rotary motor.\""},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"\"Where does it get its energy?\" I asked. \"That's an interesting phenomenon,\" he replied. \"Some other biological systems that generate movement, like muscles, use energy that has been stored in what's called a `carrier molecule.' But the flagellum uses another system-energy ge nerated by a flow of acid through the bacterial membrane. This is a complex process that scie ntists are still studying and trying to understand. The whole system works really well-the flag ellum's propeller can spin at ten thousand revolutions per minute.\" As a car aficionado, I was stagge red by that statistic! A friend had recently given me a ride in his exotic high-performance spor ts car, and I knew it wasn't capable of generating that many rpms. Even the notoriously high -revving Honda S2000, with a state- of-the-art, fourcylinder, two- liter, dual-overhead-cam aluminum block engine, fe aturing four valves pe r cylinder and variable intake and exhaust valve timing, has a redline of only nine thousand rpms. 9 \"Not only that,\" Behe continue d, \"but the propeller can stop spinning with in a quarter turn and instantly start spinning th e other way at ten thousand rp ms. Howard Berg of Harvard University called it the most efficient motor in the universe. It's way beyond anything we can make, especially when you consider its size.\" \"How small is it?\" \"A flagellum is on the order of a couple of microns. A micron is about 1/20,000 of an inch. Most of its length is the propeller. The motor itself would be maybe 1/100,000ths of an inch. Even with all of our te chnology, we can't even begin to create something like this. Sometimes in my lectures I show a drawing of the flagellu m from a biochemistry textbook, and people say it looks like something from NASA . If you think about it, we've discovered machines inside our- selves. On Star Trek they had a creature called the Borg, wh ich has tiny machines inside. Well, it turns out everybody does!\" Drawings of the flagellum are, indeed, very impressive, since they look uncannily like a machine that human beings would construct. I remember a scientist telling me about his father, an accomplished engineer who was highly skeptical about claims of intelligent design. The dad could never understand why his son was so convin ced that the world had been designed by an intelligent agent. One day the scientist put a drawi ng of the bacterial flagellum in front of him. Fascinated, the engineer studied it silently for a while, then looked up and said to his son with a sense of wonder: \"Oh, now I get what you've been saying.\" \"Think of this too,\" Behe continued. \"Imagi ne a boat with its motor running. Uh-oh! Nobody's steering it. It goes out and crashes boom! Well, who's steering the bacterial cell? It turns out it has sensory systems that feed into the bacteria flagellum and tell it when to turn on and when to turn off, so that it guides it to food, light , or whatever it's seeking. In a sense, it's like those smart missiles that have guidance systems to help them find their target, except there's no explosion at the end!\" \"And the flagellum is irreducibly complex?\" \"That's right,\" he said. \"Genetic studies have shown that between thirty and thirty-five proteins are needed to create a f unctional flagellum. I haven't even begun to descri be all of its complexities; we don't even know the roles of all its proteins. But at a mi nimum you need at least three parts-a paddle, a rotor, and a motor-that ar e made up of various proteins. Eliminate one of those parts and you don't get a flagellum that only spins at five thousand rpms; you get a flagellum that simply doesn't work at all. So it's irreducibly complexand a huge stumbling block to Darwinian theory.\" I asked, \"Has anyone been able to propose a st ep-by-step evolutionary explanation of how a"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"gradual process could have yielded a flagellum?\" \"In a word-no,\" he said with a chuckle. \"For most irreducibly complex systems, the best you get is a sort of hand-waving, cartoonish explanati on, but certainly nothing that approaches being realistic. Even evolutionary biologist A ndrew Pomiankowski admitted: `Pick up any biochemistry textbook, and you will find perhaps two or three references to evolution. Turn to one of these and you will be luc ky to find anything better than `evol ution selects the fittest mole- cules for their biological function.' \"But for the flagellum, there aren't even a ny cartoon explanations. The best the Darwinists have been able to muster is to say that the flagellum has components that look like the components of other systems that don't have as ma ny parts, so maybe somehow this other system had something to do with the flagellum. Nobody knows where this subsystem came from in the first place, or how or why the subsystem may have turned into a flagellum. So, no, there's no reasoned explanation anyone has been able to offer.\" I tried another approach. \"What about Darwinists who say, `Maybe it's merely too early for us to come up with a road map of how these gradual changes developed. Someday we'll better understand the flagellum, so have patience-i n the end, science is going to figure it out.\"' Behe leaned back in his chair. \"You know, Darw inists always accuse folks in the Intelligent Design movement of making an argument from i gnorance. Well, that's a pure argument from ignorance! They're saying, `We have no idea how this could have happe ned, but let's assume evolution somehow did it.' You've heard of 'G odof-the-gaps'-inserting God when you don't have another explanation? Well, this is 'evolution-of-the -gaps.' Some scientists merely insert evolution when they don't understand something. \"Look-we may not understand everything about these biological systems, but we do know some things. We do know that these systems have a number of very specifically matched components that do not lend themselves to a gra dualistic explanation. We know that intelligence can assemble complex systems, like computers and mousetraps and things like that. The complexity we see is not going to be alleviated by the more we learn; it can only get more complicated. We will only discover more details about the systems. \"Here's an illustration. Let's say you have a car in a dark garage. You shine a flashlight on one part of the engine and you see all of its components and its obvious complexity. Shining the flashlight on another part of the motor isn't going to make the first part go away. It isn't going to make the problem any simpler; it's going to make it more complicated. And as we discover more about the flagellum, it won't negate the complexity we've already found. All we'll have is an even more complicated, more impressive, more interd ependent machineand an even greater challenge to Darwinian theory.\" MOLECULAR TRUCKS AND HIGHWAYS According to Behe, the cilium and bacterial flagellum are just the beginning of the Darwin- defying complexity in the microscopic world of th e cell. One of his other favorites is the \"intra- cellular transport system.\" \"The cell is not a simple bag of soup, with everything sloshi ng around,\" he sa id. \"Instead, eukaryotic cells-cells of all organisms except b acteria-have a number of compartments, sort of like rooms in a house. \"There's the nucleus, where the DNA resides; the mitochondria, which produce energy; the endoplasmic reticulum, which processes proteins; the Golgi apparatus, wh ich is a way station for proteins that are being transported elsewhere; the lysosome, which is a garbage disposal unit;"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"secretory vesicles, which store cargo before it's sent out of the cell; and the peroxisome, which helps metabolize fats. Each compartment is sealed off by a membrane, just like a room has walls and a door. In fact, the mitochondr ion has four separate sections. Counting everything, there are more than twenty different sections in each cell. \"Cells are constantly getting rid of old stu ff and manufacturing new components, and these components are designed to work in one room bu t not others. Most new components are made at a central location in the cell on things called ribosomes.\" Denton has described the ribosome, a collectio n of some fifty large molecules containing more than one million atoms, as an automated fact ory that can synthesize any protein that it is instructed to make by DNA. Give n the correct genetic information, in fact, it can construct any protein-based biological machine, including anot her ribosome, regardless of the complexity. Denton marveled: It is astonishing to think that this rema rkable piece of machinery, which possesses the ultimate capacity to construct every living thing that has ever existed on Earth, from a giant redwood to the human brain, can constr uct all its own components in a matter of minutes and ... is of the order of several thousand million million times smaller than the smallest piece of functional mach inery ever constructed by man.\" \"Not only is the ribosome amazing,\" Behe said, \"but now you're faced with the challenge of getting these new components into the right room s where they can operate. In order to do that, you need to have another complicated system, just like you need a lot of things in place for a Greyhound bus to take someone from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh. \"First of all, you've got to have molecular trucks , which are enclosed and have motors attached to them. You've got to have little highways for th em to travel along. You've got to be able to identify which components are supposed to go into which truck-after all, it doesn't do any good if you just grab any protein that comes along, becaus e each one needs to go to a specific room. So there has to be a signal attached to the protein-so rt of a ticket-to let th e protein onto the right molecular truck. The truck has to know where it's going, which means having a signal on the truck itself and a complementary signal on the compartment where the truck is supposed to unload its cargo. \"When the truck arrives where it's supposed to go, it's kind of like a big ocean liner that has crossed from London to New York. It pulls u p at the dock and everyone's waving-but, oops, they forgot the gang plank. Now what are you going to do? You see, you've got to have a way for the cargo to get out of the truck and into the compartm ent, and it turns out this is an active process that involves other components recognizing each other, physically opening things up, and allowing the material to go inside. \"So you've got numerous components, all of which have to be in place or nothing works. If you don't have the signal, if you don't have the tr uck, you're pretty much out of luck. Now, does this microscopic transportation system sound like something that self-assembled by gradual modifications over the years? I don't see how it could have been. To me , it has all the earmarks of being designed.\" THE BLOOD-CLOTTING CASCADE There was a pause in our conversation as my mind processed the stupefying complexity of the cilium, flagellum, and intracellular transport system. As I began to formulate my next line of questioning, Behe noticed a Band- Aid on one of my fingers, coveri ng a cut I had received while"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"picking up pieces of broken glass the previous day. \"Irreducible complexity is a very relevant t opic,\" he commented as he gestured toward the bandage. \"An irreducibly complex system just saved your life.\" \"What do you mean?\" I asked. \"Blood clotting,\" he said. \"If your blood hadn't cl otted in the right place and in the right amount and at the right time, you wo uld have bled to death. As it tu rns out, the system of blood clotting involves a highly choreo graphed cascade of ten steps th at use about twenty different molecular components. Without the whole system in place, it doesn't work.\" Suddenly, I felt a personal stake in th e topic. \"Tell me more,\" I said. \"The real trick with blood clotti ng isn't so much the clot itself-i t's just a blob that blocks the flow of blood-but it's the regula tion of the system,\" he continued. \"If you make a clot in the wrong place-say, the brain or lung you'll die. If you make a clot twenty minutes after a ll the blood has drained from your body, you' ll die. If the blood clot isn't confined to the cut, your entire blood system might solidify, and you'll die. If yo u make a clot that doesn't cover the entire length of the cut, you'll die. To create a perfectly balanced blood- clotting system, clusters of protein components have to be inserted all at once. That rules out a gradualistic Darwinian approach and fits the hypothesis of an intelligent designer.\" Surely, I thought to myself, there must be anot her way. \"Some scientists have proposed that a process called `gene duplicati on' can account for the creation of new components for complex biological systems,\" I said. \"Why wouldn' t that work with blood clotting?\" Gene duplication can happen during the process of cell division when DNA is being copied from the original cell for use in the new cell. O ccasionally, the process goes awry and a piece of DNA, perhaps a gene, is copied twice. This creates an extra gene. While the original gene can go about its pre-assigned role, the extra gene can drift and perhaps create a new function. Some scientists have theori zed that this is how new component s might be created for irreducible systems. \"Sure, gene duplication happens,\" Behe replied. \"But what the fans of gene duplication rarely recognize is that when you get a duplicated gene, you don't get a new protein with new properties. You've got the same protei n as before. And that's a problem.\" I was having difficulty seeing why. \"Could you explain that?\" I asked. He glanced down at the mousetrap, which was stil l sitting on his desk. \"Let's go back to the mousetrap analogy,\" he said. \"S uppose you have a one-component m ousetrap, with two ends of a metal spring being bent and pressi ng against each other under tensi on so that if a mouse disturbs them, they'll slip and spring and hopefully catch a paw or tail. And say you wanted to develop a more efficient two-component trap that has a wooden base as well as the spring. \"According to the concept of gene duplication, you would make a copy of the first spring. Now you've got two springs-except the second spring somehow becomes a wooden base. Do you see the conceptual disconnect? You can't just say the spring somehow morphs into a wooden base without doing more than just saying, `gene duplication did it.' The problem is, Darwinists don't provide the details of how this can actually happen in the real world. \"When one scientist tried to co me up with a step-by-step scen ario of how blood-clotting could have developed, he couldn't avoid generalizing by saying a component suddenly `appears,' or `is born,' or, `arises,' or, `springs fo rth,' or `is unleashed.\"' What's causing all of this springing forth and unleashing? There's no meaningf ul explanation of what could ha ve caused these steps to take place. These are details that doom these scenarios. \"And there are a lot more problems than that. How can blood clotting develop over time, step"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"by step, when in the meantime the animal has no effective way to stop from bleeding to death whenever it's cut? And when you've only got part of a system in place, the system doesn't work, so you've got the components sitting around doing nothing-and natural sele ction only works if there is something useful right now, not in the future. \"Besides, at best the explanatio ns that some people attempt are mere word pictures. In science we're supposed to do experiments to show some thing is true. Nobody has ever done experiments to show how blood-clotting could have developed. Nobody has been able to show how a duplicated gene can develop some new function wh ere it starts to make a new and irreducibly complex pathway.\" SURVIVING THE ACID TEST There is a scientific way, however, to establ ish through experimental data whether Belie's concept of irreducible complexity is really an insuperable barrier for Da rwinism. I was anxious to see whether Behe's ideas could survive this formidable challenge from Miller, a biology professor who's an ardent and outspoken evolutionist. The \"true acid test,\" explained Miller, would be to use \"the t ools of molecular genetics to wipe out an existing multi-part system and then s ee if evolution can come to the rescue with a system to replace it.\"13 If the system can be replaced purely by naturalistic evolutionary processes, then Behe's theory has been disproved. After describing Miller's challenge, I asked Behe : \"Do you agree this would be a fair test?\" Without hesitation, he said: \"Yes, I agree. That's a terrific test.\" Then I said: \"Miller went on to describe an experiment by scien tist Barry Hall of the University of Rochester to s how how this apparently was done in the labora tory. Miller concluded: `No doubt about it-th e evolution of biochemical systems, even complex multi-part ones, is explicable in terms of evolution. Behe is wrong.\"' 14 I faced Behe squarely. \"Tell me, has Hall prove d through his experiment that your theory is incorrect?\" Unflustered, Behe replied: \"No, not really. Actually, Hall is very modest about what his experiment shows. He didn't knock out a comple x system and then s how how evolution can replace it. Instead, he knocked out one component of a system that has five or six components. And replacing one component in a complex system is a lot easier than building one from scratch. \"For instance, suppose someone told you that natural processes could produce a working television set. You'd say, `That's interesti ng. Why don't you show me?' He would then unplug a thousand television sets. Eventually, a strong wind would come along and blow one plug back into the outlet, and the TV would come on. He w ould say, `See? I told you that natural processes could produce a working TV.' But that's not ex actly what happened. He wasn't producing a new complex system; there was a glitch introduced and he showed that on occasion this can be fixed by random processes. \"That's a little like what went on with Ha ll's experiment with the bacterium E. coll. There was a complex system with a number of different parts, he knocked out one of them, and after a while he showed that random processes came up with a fix for that one part. That's a far cry from producing a brand new system from scratch. \"But there's something equally important: Hall made it clear that he had intervened to keep the system going while evolution was trying to co me up with a replacemen t for the missing part. In other words, he added a chemical to the mi xture that gave it the time to come up with the mutation that fixed the glitch. The result never w ould have actually happen ed in nature without"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"his intelligent intervention in the experiment. \"Here's another analogy. Suppose you say you can make a three-legged stool by random processes. You take a th ree-legged stool and break off one leg. Then you hol d up the stool so it won't fall over. Finally, a wind comes along, knocks down a tree branch, and it accidentally falls right where the missing leg had been. You're intervening to help the stool through the stage where it would otherwise have fall en over and you've made it possibl e for the branch to fit in the right place. \"Back to Hall's experiment. Without going into th e technical details, which I've done in more formal responses,'' in nature you couldn't have gotten just the mutation that he got in the laboratory. You would have had to have simultaneously gotten a second mutation-and the odds of that would have been prohibiti ve. Hall made it clear that he in tervened so that he would get results that would never have actually happened in the natural world. And that is injecting intelligence into the system. \"When you analyze the entire experiment, the re sult is exactly what you would expect of irreducible complexity requiri ng intelligent intervention. Unin tentionally, he has shown the limits of Darwinism and the need for design.\" WHIRLPOOLS AND TORNADOES \"What about other alternatives to Darwinia n gradualism?\" I asked. \"How about self- organization? Maybe there's some sort of self organizational property in biochemistry that encourages the parts of molecula r machines to self-assemble.\" \"Just like natural selection explai ns some things, self organization explains some things too. The controversy arises when they're used to explain big things or everything,\" Behe said. \"It's true that if you pull out the plug in your ba thtub, the water forms a little whirlpool. That's self-organization: the water is moving in an organized fashion whereas it wasn't before. Tornadoes organize themselves. If you mix chemi cals together in a certain way, you get a system that acts like a clock. It will turn blue, five seconds later it will turn colorless, and it will oscillate back and forth. So it's clear that there is such a thing as self-organization. \"The question is, can it explain more complicated phenomena? Can it explain the genetic code? Scientists trying to solve the riddle of the origin of life have been exploring self- organizational properties for decades. Yet today th ey're more confused about the origin of life than fifty years ago. They haven't come up with any explanation for how self-organization could account for something as complex as even the first primitive living organism. \"Right now, there's only one principle that we know can come up with complex interactive systems, and that's intelligence. Natural selecti on has been proposed, but there's little or no evidence backing that claim. Some people had high hopes for self-organizational properties or complexity theory, but there's no evidence that these can explain something as complicated as the cell. The only force known to be able to make irreducibly complex machines is intelligent design. \"So scientists are in the curi ous position of ignoring something they know to be capable of explaining what they see in biol ogy, in favor of phantom or to tally unproven explanations. Why ignore intelligent design when it' s a good match to the data? Yes, we have to keep an open mind in science, but we shouldn't be ignoring the most obvious explan ation for all the evidence we have today.\" \"One reason some scientists are reluctant,\" I sa id, \"is because they claim intelligent design is not falsifiable.\" I was referring to the belief among many philos ophers and scientists that a"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"theory cannot truly be scientif ic unless there are potential ways to prove it false through experiments or other means. 16 \"That's silly,\" Behe replied. \"But I hear it over and over,\" I insisted. \"The National Academy of Sciences said: `Intelligent design ... [is] not science because [it's] not testable by the methods of science.\"' \"Yes, I know,\" he said, \"but what's really ironic is that intelligent design is routinely called unfalsifiable by the very people w ho are busy trying to falsify it! As you just pointed out, Miller proposed a test that would falsify the claim that intelligence is needed to produce an irreducibly complex system. So I don't see the problem. In telligent design's strong point is that it's falsifiable, just like a good scientific theory should be. Frankly, I'd say it's more falsifiable than Darwinism is.\" \"Come on,\" I said. \"Do you really believe that?\" \"Yes, I do, and I'll give you an example,\" he replied. \"My claim is that there is no unintelligent process that could produce the bacter ial flagellum. To falsify that claim, all you would have to do would be to find one unintelligent process that could produce that system. On the other hand, Darwinists claim that some unintelligent process could produce the flagellum. To falsify that, you'd have to show that the system could not possibly have b een created by any of a potentially infinite number of possible unintelligent processes. That's impossible to do. So which claim is falsifiable? I'd say the claim for intelligent design.\" That isn't the only objection that Behe has turn ed on its head. While Darwinists often accuse intelligent design proponents of letting their religious beliefs color their science, Behe once told a newspaper reporter: \"It has been my experi ence ... that the ones wh o oppose the theory of design most vociferously do so for religious reasons.\"\" 8 \"What did you mean by that?\" I asked. \"It seems that the folks who get the most anim ated when talking about Darwinian evolution are the ones most concerned with the philosophical and theological ramificati ons of the theory, not the science itself,\" he explained. \"Scientists propose hypotheses all the time. No big deal. But if I say, `I don't think natural selection is the driving force for the development of life; I think it was intelligent design,' people don't just disagree; many of them jump up and down and get red in the face. When you talk to them about it, invariably they're not excited beca use they disagree with the science; it's because they see the extra-scien tific implications of intelligent design and they don't like where it's leading.\" Behe shrugged. \"I guess that's okay,\" he adde d. \"These are important issues and people can get emotional about them. But we should not use what we want to be true to dismiss arguments or try to avoid them.\" THE ARROW OF PROGRESS Behe's concept of irreducible complexity is at once a negative and a positive argument. First, he has taken Darwin at his own word and de monstrated how these interconnected biological systems could not have been creat ed through the numerous, successi ve, slight modifications that his theory demands. The result has been a st aggeringsome say lethal-blow to Darwinism. Second, Behe has pointed out that there is an alternative that does su fficiently explain how complex biological machines could have been creat ed. Once again, as with the previous experts I had interviewed on cosmology, physics, and astronomy, the evidence conspires to point toward a transcendent Creator."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"\"My conclusion can be summed up in a single word: design,\" Behe said as we came to the end of our interview. \"I say that based on science. I believe that irreducibly complex systems are strong evidence of a purposeful, intentional desi gn by an intelligent agent. No other theory succeeds; certainly not Darwinism. \"Based on the empirical eviden ce-which is continuing to mount-I'd agree with Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger that `the gr eat projects of the living creation are not the products of chance and error.... [They] point to a creating Reason and show us a creating Inte lligence, and they do so more luminously and radiantl y today than ever before.\"' 19 \"Your book has been out for several years now,\" I said. \"How well do you think it has endured so far?\" \"I'm very pleased with how things stand,\" he said, leaning back in his chair and casually folding his arms over his chest. \"It has attracted a lot of attention from people who have tried to knock it down, but they haven't been able to do it. Complex biological systems have yet to be explained by naturalistic means. That's a fact. Even Darwinists admit that in their candid moments. And as science advances, we're continui ng to find more and more complexity in the cellular world. This, Lee, is the arrow of progress. \"I do hear occasional complaints that scien ce needs to pretend that everything works by natural law and that inte lligent design is `giving up.' I've never seen the logic of that. The purpose of science, it seems to me, is to find out how things got here and how they work. Science should be the search for truth, not merely the s earch for materialistic explanations. The great scientists of history-Newton and Einstein, for in stance-never thought science's job was to come up with some sort of self-suffi cient explanation for nature. This is a recent i nnovation, and not a good one-especially in light of disc overies during the last fifty y ears that have pointed in the exact opposite direction.\" Behe and I continued to talk for a while, th en we shook hands and parted ways. As I lingered in the hallway, peering th rough the glass into various labor atories where scientists were hard at work, I thought of the concession by micr obiologist James Shapiro of the University of Chicago in his review of Behe's book: \"The re are no detailed Darwinian accounts for the evolution of any fundamental biochemical or cellular system, only a variety of wishful speculations.\" 20 Shapiro might not be amenable to Behe's ultimate conclusions, but personally I wasn't ready to bank on wishful speculations. Connecting the dots from my interviews with William Lane Craig, Robin Collins, Guillermo Gonzalez, Jay Richards, and now Michael Behe, I was coming up with a picture that was squarely at odds with the icons that had once led me into atheism. In the words of Allan Sandage, one of the most highly respected scie ntists of our age: The world is too complicated in all its parts and interconnections to be due to chance alone. I am convinced that the ex istence of life with all its orde r in each of its organisms is simply too well put together. Each part of a living thing depends on all its other parts to function. How does each part know? How is each part specified at conception? The more one learns of biochemistry the more unbelieva ble it becomes unless there is some type of organizing principle-an architect for believers, a mystery to be solved by science (even as to why) sometime in the indefinite future for materialist reductionalists. 21 That mystery was going to take me even deeper inside the awe-inspiring, microscopic realm of the cell. As I started my rental car and bega n to drive down the asphalt road from Lehigh's Mountaintop Campus, I remembered that Ste phen Meyer, the philosopher of science I had"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"already interviewed about the relationship between science and faith, has written extensively on DNA.

If the full text of the encyclopedia were to arri ve in computer code from outer space, most people would regard this as proof of the exis tence of extraterrestrial intelligence. But when seen in nature, it is explained as the workings of random forces. George Sim Johnson Einstein said, “God does not play dice. ” He was right, God plays Scrabble. Philip Gold In 1953, when Francis Crick told his wife Odile th at he and a colleague had discovered the secret of life-the chemical structure of DNA, where the instructions for building proteins were encoded- she didn't believe him. Years later, she confes sed to her husband: \"You were always coming home and saying things like that, so naturally I thought nothing of it.\" This time, he wasn't exaggerating. He and James D. Watson would win the Nobel Prize for discovering the now-famous double helix of deoxyri bonucleic acid, where the \"language of life\" is stored. For more than fifty years, as scientists have studied the six feet of DNA that's tightly coiled inside every one of our body's one hundred trillion cells they have marveled at how it provides the genetic information necessary to create all of the proteins out of which our bodies are built. In fact, each one of the thirty thousand genes that are embedded in our twenty-three pairs of chromosomes can yield as many as 20,500 different kinds of proteins. 4 The astounding capacity of microscopic DNA to harbor this mountain of information, carefully spelled out in a four-letter chemical alphabet, \"vastly exceeds that of any other known system,\" said geneticist Michael Denton. In fact, he said the information needed to build the proteins for all the species of organisms that have ever lived-a number estimated to be approximately one thousand million-\"could be"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"held in a teaspoon and there would still be room left for all the information in every book ever written.\" 5 DNA serves as the information storehouse for a finely choreographed manufacturing process in which the right amino acids are linked together with the right bonds in the right sequence to produce the right kind of proteins that fold in the right way to build biological systems. The documentary Unlocking the Mystery of Life, which has aired on numerous PBS television stations, describes the elaborate operation this way: In a process known as transcription, a molecu lar machine first unwinds a section of the DNA helix to expose the genetic instructions needed to assemble a specific protein molecule. Another machine then copies these instructions to form a molecule known as messenger RNA. When transcription is comp lete, the slender RNA strand carries the genetic information ... out of the cell nucleus . The messenger RNA strand is directed to a two-part molecular factory called a ribos ome.... Inside the ribosome, a molecular assembly line builds a specifically sequenced chain of amino acids. These amino acids are transported from other parts of the cell and th en linked into chains often hundreds of units long. Their sequential arrangement determines the type of protei n manufactured. When the chain is finished, it is moved from the ribosome to a barrelshaped machine that helps fold it into the precise shape critical to its f unction. After the chain is folded into a protein, it is then released and shepherded by anot her molecular machine to the exact location where it is needed. 6 It was this \"absolutely mind- boggling\" procedure that helped lead biology professor Dean Kenyon to repudiate the conclusions of his own book on the chemical origin of life and conclude instead that nothing short of an intelligence could have created this intricate cellular apparatus. \"This new realm of molecular gene tics [is] where we see the most compelling evidence of design on the Earth,\" he said. It seemed fitting that when scientists announced that they had finally mapped the three billion codes of the human genome-a project that filled the equivalent of 75,490 pages of The New York Times- divine references abounded. President Clinton said scientists were \"learning the language in which God created life,\" while geneticist Francis S. Collins, head of the Human Genome Project, said DNA was \"our own instru ction book, previously known only to God.\" 8 Are such public bows to a Creator merely a polite social custom, meant only as a nodding courtesy to a predominantly theistic country? Or does the bounty of information in DNA really warrant the conclusion that an in telligent designer must have in fused genetic material with its protein-building instructions? Are there any naturalistic processes that can account for the appearance of biological data in the earliest cells? I knew where to go to get answ ers.

Lately he has been finishing a book called DNA by Design: The Si gnature in the Cell, which further expands on his analysis of biological information. We got together on an unusually sultry summer day, had a pleasant lunch in an avant-garde Asian restaurant, and then settled into an office at the Discovery Institute. Meyer lowered his lanky frame into a plain wooden chair, his back to a half-opened window through which random traffic noises could be heard. It was nearly midafternoon befo re we got started with our discussion. It was clear that Meyer likes the give-and-take of interviews. Although Meyer is typically more professorial than pugnacious, I've never he ard of him shying away from tough questions or even rhetorically bloody debates with fervent Darwinists. In fact, I once hosted the videotaping of an intellectual shoot-out between Meyer and an atheistic anthropologist on the legi timacy of intelligent-design theories, and I remember walking away amazed at Meyer's finesse in deftly disman tling the professor's case while at the same time forcefully presenting his own. Maybe that's a throwback to Meyer's earlier years when he trained as a boxer, learning to overcome fears of taki ng a punch and how to jab away at an opponent's weaknesses. As for me, I wasn't after blood in this inte rview; I was merely seeking straightforward answers to an issue that has befuddled originof- life scientists for the last five decades. Even though most Darwinists concede they are stum ped on the question of how DNA and life itself came into existence, 1 ' they don't like Meyer's conclusions on the matter. I didn't care much about that; my criterion was simple: what makes the most sense from a purely scientific perspective? THE DNA-TO-DESIGN ARGUMENT I began our discussion by reading Meyer a quote that I had encountered in my research and scribbled in my notes. \"A ccording to Bernd-Olaf Kuppers, the author of Information and the Origin of Life, `The problem of the origin of life is clear ly basically equivalent to the problem of the origin of biological information,\" \"' I said. \"Do you agree with him?\" \"Oh, absolutely, yes,\" Meyer replied. \"When I ask students what they would need to get their computer to perform a new functio n, they reply, `You have to give it new lines of code.' The same principle is true in living organisms. \"If you want an organism to acquire a new f unction or structure, you have to provide information somewhere in the cell. You need inst ructions for how to build the cell's important components, which are mostly proteins. And we know that DNA is the repository for a digital code containing the instructions for telling the cell's machinery how to build proteins. Kuppers recognized that this was a critical hurdle in ex plaining how life began: where did this genetic information come from? \"Think of making soup from a recipe. You can have all the ingredients on hand, but if you"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"don't know the proper proportions, or which items to a dd in what order, or how long to cook the concoction, you won't get a s oup that tastes very good. \"Well, a lot of people talk about the `prebiotic soup'-the chemicals that supposedly existed on the primitive Earth prior to life. Even if you had the right chemicals to create a living cell, you would also need information for ho w to arrange them in very speci fic configurations in order to perform biological functions. Ever since the 1950s and 1960s, biologis ts have recognized that the cell's critical functions are us ually performed by proteins, a nd proteins are the product of assembly instructions stored in DNA.\" \"Let's talk about DNA, then,\" I said. \"You've wr itten that there's a'DNA-to-design argument.' What do you mean by that?\" Meyer removed a pair of gold -rimmed glasses from his shirt pocket and put them on as he began to give his answer. \"Very simply,\" he said , \"I mean that the origin of information in DNA- which is necessary for life to begin-is best expl ained by an intelligent cause rather than any of the types of naturalistic causes that scientists typically use to explai n biological phenomena.\" \"When you talk about `information' in DNA, what exactly do you mean?\" I asked. \"We know from our experience that we can c onvey information with a twenty-six-letter alphabet, or twenty-two, or thirty-or even just two characters, lik e the zeros and ones used in the binary code in computers. One of the most extraordinary discoveries of the twentieth century was that DNA actually stores information-the deta iled instructions for a ssembling proteins-in the form of a four-chara cter digital code. \"The characters happen to be chemicals called adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. Scientists represent them with the letters A, G , C, and T, and that's appropriate because they function as alphabeti c characters in the genetic text. Proper ly arranging those four `bases,' as they're called, will instruct the cell to build different sequences of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. Diffe rent arrangements of characters yields different sequences of amino acids.\" With that, Meyer decided to show me an illust ration he often uses with college students. Reaching over to a desk drawer, he took out several oversized plas tic snap-lock beads of the sort that young children play with. \"It sa ys on the box that these are for kids ages two to four, so this is advanced chemistry,\" he joked. He held up orange, green, blue, red, and purple beads of different shapes. \"These represent the structure of a protein. Essent ially, a protein is a long linear array of amino acids,\" he said, snapping the beads together in a line. \"Because of the forces between the amino acids, the proteins fold into very particular three-dimensional shapes,\" he added as he bent and twisted the line of beads. \"These three-dimensional shapes are highly irregular, sort of lik e the teeth in a key, and they have a lock-key fit with other molecules in the cell. Often, the proteins will catalyze reactions, or they'll form structural molecules, or linkers, or parts of the molecular machines that Michael Behe writes about. This specific three-dimensional shape, which allows proteins to perform a function, derives directly from the one-dimensional sequencing of amino acids.\" Then he pulled some of the beads apart and began rearranging their order. \"If I were to switch a red one and a blue one, I'd be setting up a different combination of force interactions and the protein would fold completely differently. So the sequence of the amino acids is critical to getting the long chain to fold properly to form an actual functional protein. Wrong sequence, no folding-and the sequence of amino acids is unable to serve its function. \"Proteins, of course, are the key functional mo lecule in the cell; you can't have life without"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"them. Where do they come from? Well, that questi on forces a deeper issue-what's the source of the assembly instructions in DNA that are responsible for the one-dimensional sequential arrangements of amino acids that create the three-dimensional shapes of proteins? Ultimately,\" he emphasized, \"the functional attributes of protei ns derive from information stored in the DNA molecule.\" THE LIBRARY OF LIFE I was fascinated by the process that Meyer had described. \"What you' re saying is that DNA would be like a blueprint for how to build prot eins,\" I said, using an analogy I had heard many times before. Meyer hesitated. \"Actually, I don't like the bluepr int metaphor,\" he said. \"You see, there are probably other sources of informa tion in the cell and in organism s. As important as DNA is, it doesn't build everything. All it bui lds are the protein molecules, but they are only sub-units of larger structures that themselves are informatively arranged.\" \"Then what's a better analogy?\" I asked. \"DNA is more like a library,\" he said. \"The organism accesses the info rmation that it needs from DNA so it can build some of its critical com ponents. And the librar y analogy is better because of its alphabetic nature. In DNA, there are long lines of A, C, G, and T's that are precisely arranged in order to create protein structure and fold ing. To build one protein, you typically need 1,200 to 2,000 letters or ba ses-which is a lot of information.\" \"And this raises the question again of th e origin of that in formation,\" I said. \"It's not just that a question has been rais ed,\" he insisted. \"This issue has caused all naturalistic accounts of th e origin of life to break down, because it's the critical and foundational question. If you can't explain where the informa tion comes from, you ha ven't explained life, because it's the information that makes the mol ecules into something that actually functions.\" I asked, \"What does the presence of information tell you?\" \"I believe the presence of information in th e cell is best explaine d by the activity of an intelligent agent,\" he replied. \"Bill Gates said, `DNA is like a software program, only much more complex than anything we've ever devised.' That 's highly suggestive, because we know that at Microsoft, Gates uses intelligent programmers to produce software. Information theorist Henry Quastler said as far back as the 1960s that the `creation of new info rmation is habitually associated with conscious activity.'” \"But we're talking about something-the origin of information and life-that happened a long time ago,\" I said. \"How can scientists recons truct what happened in the distant past?\" \"By using a scientific princi ple of reasoning that's called uniformitarianism,\" Meyer replied. \"This is the idea that our present knowledge of cause-and-effect relationships should guide our reconstruction of what caused something to arise in the past.\" \"For example . . . ,\" I said a nd paused, hoping to prompt an il lustration that would help me follow him. \"For instance, let's say you find a certain kind of ripple marks preserved from the ancient past in sedimentary strata. And let's say that in the present day you see the same sort of ripple marks being formed in lake beds as the water evaporates. You can reasonably infer, then, using uniformitarian logic, that the ripple marks in the sedimentary strata were produced by a similar process. \"So let's go back to DNA. Even the very simplest cell we study today, or find evidence of in the fossil record, requires information that is st ored in DNA or some other information-carrier."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"And we know from our experience that informa tion is habitually associated with conscious activity. Using uniformitarian logic, we can reconstruct the cause of that ancient information in the first cell as being the product of intelligence.\" As my mind tracked his line of reasoning, everything seemed to click into place-except one thing. \"However,\" I said, \"there's a caveat.\" Meyer cocked an eyebrow. \"Like what?\" he asked. \"All of that is true-unless you can find some better explanation.\" \"Yes, of course,\" he said. \"You have to rule ou t other causes of the same effect. Origin-of-life scientists have looked at ot her possibilities for decades and, frankly, they've come up dry.\" Before we went any further, though, I needed to satisfy myself that the other major possible scenarios fall short of the intelligent design theory. THE MISSING SOUP In 1871, Charles Darwin wrote a lett er in which he speculated that life might have originated when \"a protein compound was chemically formed ... in some warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, light, heat, electricity, etc. present.\" 13 A few years ago a scientist summarized the basic theory this way: The first stage on the road to life is presumed to have been the build-up, by pure chemical synthetic processes occurring on the surface of the early Earth, of all the basic organic compounds necessary for the formation of a living cell. These ar e supposed to have accumulated in the primeval oceans, creating a nutrient broth, the so-called \"prebiotic soup.\" In certain specialized environments these organic compounds were assembled into large macromolecules, proteins and nucleic acids. Eventually, over millions of years, combinations of these macromolecules occu rred which were then endowed with the property of selfreproduction. Th en driven by natural selection ever more efficient and complex self-reproducing molecular systems evolved until finally the first simple cell system emerged. 14 \"I hear scientists talk a lot a bout this prebiotic soup,\" I said. \"How much ev idence is there that it actually existed?\" \"That's a very interesting issue,\" he replie d. \"The answer is ther e isn't any evidence.\" That's highly significant, because most origin-of-life theories presuppose the existence of this ancient chemical ocean. \"What do you mean, `there isn't any'?\" \"If this prebiotic soup had rea lly existed,\" Meyer e xplained, \"it would have been rich in amino acids. Therefore, there would have been a lot of nitrogen, because amino acids are nitrogenous. So when we examine the earliest sediments of the Earth, we should find large deposits of nitrogen -rich minerals.\" That seemed logical to me. \"What have scientists found?\" \"Those deposits have never been located. In f act, Jim Brooks wrote in 1985 that `the nitrogen content of early organic matter is relati vely low-just .015 percent.' He said in Origins of Life: `From this we can be reasonab ly certain that there never was any substantial amount of `primitive soup' on Earth when pre-Cambrian sedime nts were formed; if such a soup ever existed it was only for a brief period of time.\"' 15 This was an astounding conclusion! \"Don't you find that surprising, since scientists routinely talk about the prebio tic soup as if it were a given?\" I asked. \"Yes, certainly it's surprising,\" he replied. \"Denton commented on this in Evolution: A"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Theory in Crisis, when he said: `Considering th e way the prebiotic soup is referred to in so many discussions of the origin of life as an alrea dy established reality, it co mes as something of a shock to realize that there is absolutely no positiv e evidence for its existence.'16 And even if we were to assume that the prebiotic soup did exist, there would have been significant problems with cross-reactions.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Take Stanley Miller's origin-of-life experiment fi fty years ago, when he tried to recreate the early Earth's atmosphere and spark it with electr icity. He managed to create two or three of the protein-forming amino acids out of the twenty-two that exist.\" I interrupted to let Meyer know that biologist Jonathan We lls had already told me how Miller's experiment used an atmosphere that scientists now recognize wa s unrealistic, and that using the correct environmen t doesn't yield any biological ly relevant amino acids. \"That's right,\" Meyer continued. \"What's also interesting, however, is that Miller's amino acids reacted very quickly with the other chemicals in the cham ber, resulting in a brown sludge that's not lifefriendly at all. That's what I mean by cross-reactions-even if amino acids existed in the theoretical prebiotic soup, they would have r eadily reacted with other chemicals. This would have been another tremendous barrier to the fo rmation of life. The wa y that origin-of-life scientists have dealt with this in their experiments has been to remove these other chemicals in the hope that further reactions could take the experiment in a life-friendly direction. \"So instead of simulating a natural process, they interfered in order to get the outcome they wanted. And that,\" Meyer concluded, \"is intelligent design.\" Undoubtedly, obstacles to the formation of life on the primitive Earth would have been extremely formidable, even if the world were awas h with an ocean of biol ogical precursors. Still, is there any reasonable naturalistic route to life? Like a homicide detective rounding up the usual suspects, I decided to ru n down the three possible scenarios to see if any of them made sense. SCENARIO #1: RANDOM CHANCE I began with an observation. \"I know that the id ea of life forming by random chance is out of vogue right now among sc ientists,\" I said Meyer agreed. \"Virtually all origin-of-life experts have utterly rejected th at approach,\" he said with a wave of his hand. \"Even so, the idea is still very much alive at the popular level,\" I pointed out. \"For many college students who speculate a bout these things, chance is stil l the hero. They think if you let amino acids randomly interact over millions of years, life is somehow going to emerge.\" \"Well, yes, it's true that this scenario is still a live among people who don' t know all the facts, but there's no merit to it,\" Meyer replied. \"Imagine trying to generate even a simple book by throwing Scrabble lette rs onto the floor. Or imagine closing your eyes and picking Scrabble letters out of a bag. Are you going to produce Hamlet in anything like the time of the known universe ? Even a simple protein molecule, or the gene to build that molecule, is so rich in information that the entire time since the Big Bang would not give you, as my colleague Bill Dembski likes to say, the `probabilistic resources' you would need to generate that molecule by chance.\" \"Even,\" I asked, \"if the first molecule ha d been much simpler than those today?\" \"There's a minimal complexity threshold,\" he repl ied. \"There's a certain level of folding that a protein has to have, called tertiary structure, th at is necessary for it to perform a function. You"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"don't get tertiary structure in a protein unless you have at least seventy-fi ve amino acids or so. That may be conservative. Now consider what you'd need for a protein molecule to form by chance. \"First, you need the right bonds between the am ino acids. Second, amino acids come in right- handed and left-handed versions, and you've got to get only left-handed ones. Third, the amino acids must link up in a specified sequence, like letters in a sentence. \"Run the odds of these things falling in to place on their own and you find that the probabilities of forming a rather short functional protein at ra ndom would be one chance in a hundred thousand trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion. That's a ten with 125 zeroes after it! \"And that would only be one pr otein molecule-a minimally co mplex cell would need between three hundred and five hundred protein molecule s. Plus, all of this would have to be accomplished in a mere 100 million years, which is the approximate window of time between the Earth cooling and the first microfossils we've found. \"To suggest chance against those odds is really to invoke a naturalistic miracle. It's a confession of ignorance. It 's another way of saying, `We don't know.' And since the 196 0s, scientists, to their credit, have been very reluctant to say that chance played any significant role in the origin of DNA or proteins-even though, as you say, it's still unfortunately a live option in popular thinking.\" SCENARIO #2: NATURAL SELECTION Random chance might not account for the origin of life, but zoologist Richard Dawkins says that when natural selection acts on chance vari ations, then evolution is capable of scaling otherwise impossibly high peaks. In f act, that was the premise of his 1996 book Climbing Mount Improbable. He suggested that a complex biological structure is like a sheer cliff that cannot be scaled in one big bound without intermediate stepping stones, as chance must do. People look at this towering peak and think evolutionary pro cesses could never get them to the top. The backside of that same mountain, however , has a gradual slope that makes for much easier climbing. This represents th e Darwinian idea that nature prov ides small chance variations and then natural selection chooses the ones that are most advantageous. Over long periods of time, little changes accumulate into major diffe rences. So while the mountain looks impossible to climb from the cliff side, it's quite easy to scale via the smaller Darwinian steps of natural selection on the backside.' In light of that insight, I aske d Meyer: \"Can natural selectio n explain how e volution managed to scale the mountain of build ing the first living cell?\" \"Whether natural selection really works at the le vel of biological evolution is open to debate, but it most certainly does not work at the level of chemical evolution, which tries to explain the origin of the first life from simpler chemi cals,\" Meyer replied. \"As Theodosius Dobzhansky said, 'Prebiological natural selecti on is a contradiction in terms.\"' 18 \"How so?\" I asked. \"Darwinists admit that natural selection requir es a self-replicating or ganism to work,\" he explained. \"Organisms reproduce, their offspri ng have variations, the ones that are better adapted to their environment survive better, an d so those adaptations are preserved and passed on to the next generation."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"\"However, to have reproduction, there has to be ce ll division. And that presupposes the existence of information-rich DNA and proteins. Bu t that's the problem-those are the very things they're trying to explain! \"In other words, you've got to have a self-repl icating organism for Darwinian evolution to take place, but you can't have a self-replicating organism until you have the information necessary in DNA, which is what you're trying to explain in the first place. It's like the guy who falls into a deep hole and realizes lie needs a la dder to get out. So climbs out, goes home, gets a ladder, jumps back into the hole, a nd climbs out. It begs the question.\" I raised another possibility. \"Maybe replicati on first began in a much simpler way and then natural selection was able to take over,\" I said . \"For example, some small viruses use RNA as their genetic material. RNA mo lecules are simpler than DNA, and they can also store information and even replicate. What about the so-called `RNA first hypothesis' that says reproductive life originated in a realm that's much less complex than DNA?\" \"There's a mountain of problems with that,\" he said. \"Just to cite a couple of them, the RNA molecule would need information to function, just as DNA would, and so we 're right back to the same problem of where the information came from. Also, for a single strand of RNA to replicate, there must be an identical RNA molecule clos e by. To have a reasonabl e chance of having two identical RNA molecules of the ri ght length would require a library of ten billion billion billion billion billion billion RNA molecules-and that effectively rules out any chance origin of a primitive replicating system.\"' Although popular for a while, th e RNA theory has generated its share of skeptics. Evolutionist Robert Shapiro, a chemistry professor at New York University, said the idea at this point \"must be considered either a speculation or a matter of faith.\" 20 Origin-of-life researcher Graham Cairns-Smith said the \"many interesting a nd detailed experiments in this area\" have only served to show that the theo ry is \"highly implausible.\" 21 As Jonathan Wells noted in my earlier interview with him, biochemist Gerald Joyce of the Scripps Research Center was even more blunt: \"You have to build straw man upon straw man to get to the point where RNA is a viable first bio molecule.\" 22 Jay Roth, former professor of cell and molecu lar biology at the University of Connecticut and an expert in nucleic acids, sa id whether the original template for the first living system was RNA or DNA, the same problem ex ists. \"Even reduced to the barest essentials,\" he said, \"this template must have been very complex indeed. For this template and this template alone, it appears it is reasonable at present to suggest the possibili ty of a creator. \"23 SCENARIO #3: CHEMICAL AFFI NITIES AND SELF-ORDERING Meyer pointed out that by the early 1970s, most origin-of-life scientists had become disenchanted with the options of random chance and natural selection. As a result, some explored a third possibility: various self-organizational th eories for the origin of information-bearing macromolecules. For example, scientists theorized that chem ical attractions may have caused DNA's four- letter alphabet to self-assemble or that the natural affinities between amino acids prompted them to link together by themselves to create protein. When I broached these possibilities, Meyer's response was to bring up a name I had al ready encountered during my investigation. \"One of the first advocates of this approach was Dean Kenyon, who coauthored the textbook Biochemical Predestination,\" Meyer said. \"The title tells it all. The idea was that the development of life was inevitable because the ami no acids in proteins and the bases, or letters,"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"in the DNA alphabet had self-order ing capacities that acc ounted for the origin of the information in these molecules.\" I already knew that Kenyon had repudiated the conclusions of his own book, declaring that \"we have not the slightest chance of a chemical evolutionary origin for even the simplest of cells\" and that intelligent design \"made a great de al of sense, as it very closely matched the multiple discoveries in molecular biology.\" 24 Still, I wanted to consider the evidence for myself. \"How did this chemical attract ion supposedly work?\" I asked. \"We'll use proteins as an example,\" he said. \"Remember, proteins are composed of a long line of amino acids. The hope was that there would be some for ces of attraction between the amino acids that would cause them to line up the way they do and then fold so that the protein can perform the functions that keep a cell alive.\" I interrupted. \"You have to admit that there are examples in nature where chemical attractions do result in a kind of self-ordering.\" \"That's right,\" Meyer said. \"Salt crystals are a good illustration. Chemical forces of attraction cause sodium ions, Na+, to bond with chloride ions , Cl-, in order to form highly ordered patterns within a crystal of salt. You get a nice sequence of Na and Cl repeating over and over again. So, yes, there are lots of cases in chemistry wh ere bonding affinities of different elements will explain the origin of their mo lecular structure. Kenyon and othe rs hoped this would be the case for proteins and DNA.\" \"What turned out to be the problem?\" I asked. \"As scientists did experiments, they found th at amino acids didn't demonstrate these bonding affinities,\" Meyer replied. \"None at all?\" \"There were some very, very slight affinities, but they don't correlate to any of the known patterns of sequencing that we find in functional proteins. Obviously, that's a major problem-but there was an even bigger theoretical difficulty. In formation theorist Hubert Yockey and chemist Michael Polanyi raised a deeper is sue: `What would happen if we could explain the sequencing in DNA and proteins as a result of self-organization proper ties? Wouldn't we end up with something like a crystal of salt, wher e there's merely a repetitive sequence?'\" 2 When I asked Meyer to elaborate, he said: \"C onsider the genetic information in DNA, which is spelled out by the chemical letters A, C, G, and T. Imagine every time you had an A, it would automatically attract a G. You'd just have a repetitive sequence: A-G-A-G-A-G-AG. Would that give you a gene that could produce a protein? Absolutely not. Self-organization wouldn't yield a genetic message, only a repetitive mantra. \"To convey information, you need irregularity in sequencing. Open any book; you won't see the word `the' repeating over a nd over and over. Instead, you have an irregular sequencing of letters. They convey information because they conform to a certain known independent pattern- that is, the rules of vocabulary and grammar. That's what enables us to communicate-and that's what needs to be explained in DNA. The four le tters of its alphabet are also highly irregular while at the same time conforming to a functional requirement-that is, the correct arrangement of amino acids to create a working protein. \"Here's an example. If you go north of here in to Victoria Harbor in British Columbia, you'll see a pattern on a hillside. As the ferry approa ches, you'll realize it's a message: red and yellow flowers spell out WELCOME TO VICTORIA. That's an example of an informational sequence. \"Notice you don't have mere repetition-a W followed by an E, followed by another W and another E, and so on. Instead, there's an irregula r combination of letters that conform to an"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"independent pattern or specific set of functional requirements-E nglish vocabulary and grammar. So we immediately recognize this as informationa l. Whenever we encounter these two elements- irregularity that's specified by a set of functional requirements, which is what we call 'specified complexity'-we recognize this as information. A nd this kind of information is invariably the result of mind-not chance, not natural sel ection, and not self-organ izational processes.\" \"And this is the kind of information we find in DNA?\" I asked. \"That's correct. If all you had were repeating characters in DNA, the assembly instructions would merely tell amino acids to assemble in the same way over and ov er again. You wouldn't be able to build all the many different kinds of protein molecules you need for a living cell to function. It would be like handing a person an instruction book for how to build an automobile, but all the book said was 'the-the -the-the-the-the.' You couldn't hope to convey all the necessary information with that one-word vocabulary. \"Whereas information requires va riability, irregularity, and unpr edictability-which is what information theorists call complexityself-organi zation gives you repetitive, redundant structure, which is known as simple order. And comp lexity and order are categorical opposites. \"Chemical evolutionary theorists are not goi ng to escape this. The laws of nature, by definition, describe regular, repetitive patterns. For that reason one cannot invoke self-organizing processes to explain the origin of information, because informational sequences are irregular and complex. They exhibit the `specifi ed complexity' I talked about. Future discoveries aren't going to change this principle.\" To me, this absolutely doomed the idea of ch emical affinities accounting for the information in DNA. But Meyer wasn't through. There was yet a nother devastating problem with this theory. \"If you study DNA,\" he continued, \"you will find that its stru cture depends on certain bonds that are caused by chemical attractions. Fo r instance, there are hydrogen bonds and bonds between the sugar and phosphate molecules that form the two twisting backbones of the DNA molecule. \"However,\" he stressed, \"the re's one place where there are no chemical bonds, and that's between the nucleotide bases, whic h are the chemical letters in the DNA's assembly instructions. In other words, the letters that spell out the text in the DNA message do not interact chemically with each other in any significant way. Also, they're totally interchangeable. Each base can attach with equal f acility at any site along the DNA backbone.\" Sensing the need for an illustration, Meyer stood and reached over to the desk to grab another child's toy-a metal chalkboard with several magn etic letters sticking to it. Sitting back down, he put the chalkboard on his lap and maneuvered the letters until th ey spelled the word INFORMATION. \"My kids were young when I was first studying this, so I came up with this example,\" he said. \"We know that there are magnetic affinities he re; that's why the magnetic letters stick to the metal chalkboard.\" To demonstrate, he picked up the letter R and let the magnetism pull it back to the board. \"Notice, however, that the magnetic force is the same for each one of the letters, and so they're effectively interchangeable. You can use th e letters to spell whatever you want. Now, in DNA, each individual base, or letter, is chem ically bonded to the sugar-phosphate backbone of the molecule. That's how they're attached to the DNA's structure. But-and here's the key point- there is no attraction or bonding between the individual lette rs themselves. So there's nothing chemically that forces them into any particul ar sequence. The sequenc ing has to come from somewhere else."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"\"When I show students the magnetic letters stic king to the metal chal kboard, I ask, `How did this word INFORMATION arise?' The answer, of course, is in telligence that comes from outside the system. Neither chemistry nor physics arranged the letters this way. It was my choice. And in DNA, neither chemistry nor physics arranges the letters into the assembly instructions for proteins. Clearly, the cause come s from outside the system.\" He paused while the implications sunk in. \"And that cause,\" he stressed, \"is intelligence.\" \"ALMOST A MIRACLE\" Like a skillful boxer picking apart the defe nses of his opponent, Meyer had adroitly dismantled the three categories of naturalistic explanations for the origin of life and information in DNA. We even discussed another option-the po ssibility that some ex ternal force might be responsible for creating organiza tion, much in the same way grav ity creates a vortex as water drains from a bathtub. Meyer qu ickly dismissed that notion, point ing out that such forces may produce order but they can't manufacture information. 26 These dead-ends for naturalistic origin-of-life theo ries would not be a surp rise to scientists in the field. When prominent origin-of-life researcher Leslie Orgel ran into another evolutionist at a Detroit conference several years ago, Orgel ad mitted the overwhelming difficulties he had encountered in trying to figure out how nucleic acids might have been naturally synthesized on the primitive Earth. Then Orgel candidly conceded, \"There are equally overwhelming difficulties in the way of all theories.\" 27 In short, no hypothesis has come close to ex plaining how information necessary to life's origin arose by naturalistic means. As Crick, a philosophical materialist, has conceded: \"An honest man, armed with all the knowledge available to us now, could only state that in some sense, the origin of life appears at the moment to be almost a miracle, so many are the conditions which would have had to have been satisfied to get it going.\" 28 For many researchers, the only recourse has been to continue to have faith that, as one scientist put it, some previously unknown \"magic mineral\" will be discovered to have had \"exactly the right properties to cause the necessa ry reactions to occur to create a nucleic acid.” \"Maybe,\" I said to Meyer, \"someday scient ists will come up with another hypothesis.\" \"Maybe they will,\" he replied. \"You can't pr ove something like this with one-hundred- percent certainty, because you don't know what new evidence will show. That's why all scientists reason in a way that's provisional. Having said that, though, we do know that some possibilities can be excluded categorically. They're dead ends. For example, I think you can categorically exclude the idea that self-organizational processes can provide new information. More evidence will simply not change that.\" \"Some skeptics would claim you're arguing from ignorance,\" I pointed out. \"Scientists admit they don't know how life started, so you conclude th ere must have been an intelligent designer.\" \"No, not at all. I'm not saying intelligent desi gn makes sense simply because other theories fail,\" he insisted. \"Instead, I' m making an inference to the best explanation, which is how scientists reason in historical matters. Base d on the evidence, the scientist assesses each hypothesis on the basis of its abili ty to explain the evidence at hand. Typically, the key criterion is whether the explanation has `causal power,' which is the ability to produce the effect in question. \"In this case, the effect in question is informa tion. We've seen that neither chance, nor chance combined with natural selecti on, nor self-organizational processes have the causal power to produce information. But we do know of one entity that does have the required causal powers to"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"produce information, and that's intelligence. We're not inferring to that entity on the basis of what we don't know, but on the basis of what we do know. That's not an argument from ignorance.\" \"Isn't there a fundamental w eakness to your argument, thou gh?\" I asked. \"You're arguing by analogy, comparing the information in DNA to information we find in language. Arguments based on analogies are notoriously weak. Advo cates might emphasize the similarities between two things, but opponents will stress the differences.\" \"I'll admit that there is a way of speaking about the information in DNA that goes too far and then becomes metaphorical,\" he began. \"When pe ople talk about DNA as being a message, that could imply there was a receiver who could `unde rstand' the message. I'm not saying that DNA is this sort of semantic information. \"However, I'm not arguing by analogy. The coding regions of DNA have exactly the same relevant properties as a computer code or language. As I said earlier, whenever you find a sequential arrangement that's co mplex and corresponds to an independent pattern or functional requirement, this kind of information is always the product of intellig ence. Books, computer codes, and DNA all have these two properties. We know books and computer codes are designed by intelligence, and the presence of this type of inform ation in DNA also implies an intelligent source. \"Scientists in many fields recognize this c onnection between information and intelligence. When archaeologists discovered the Rosetta stone, they didn't think its inscriptions were the product of random chance or se lf-organizational processes. Obviously, the sequential arrangements of symbols was conveying inform ation, and it was a reasonable assumption that intelligence created it. The same principle is true for DNA.\" THE BIOLOGICAL BIG BANG Meyer had made a convincing case that intellig ence-and intelligence alone-can explain the presence of precise information within genetic ma terial. By itself, this was impressive evidence for the existence of a designer of life. As I looked down at my hand and tried to comprehend the vast quantities of complex and specific information inscribed in each cell, a slight smile formed at the corners of my mouth. The answer to the monumental questi on of whether there's a Creator, I mused, might very well be as close as my own fingertips. Meyer wasn't finished, however. As he mentioned in our previous interview, he is convinced that the so-called \"Cambrian explosion\"in wh ich a dazzling array of new life forms suddenly appears fully formed in the fossil record, with out any of the ancestor s required by Darwinism- also is powerful evidence of a designer. The re ason: this phenomenon would have required the sudden infusion of massive amounts of new genetic and other biological information that only could have come from an intelligent source. Among other places, Meyer makes that case in \"The Cambrian Information Explosion: Evidence for Intelligent Design\" in Debating Design, recently published by Cambridge University Press. Another extensive piece, \"T he Cambrian Explosion: Biology's Big Bang,\" appears in Darwinism, Design, and Public Education. Meyer coauthored this analysis with Paul Chien, chairman and professor in the biology department at the Universi ty of San Francisco, who worked with leading Chinese scientists on interpreting Cambrian fossils unique to China's Chengjiang region; Paul A. Nelson, a philosopher of biology who earned his doctorate at the University of Chicago; and paleontologist Marcus Ross."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"\"The fossils of the Cambrian Explosion absolu tely cannot be explained by Darwinian theory or even by the concept called 'punctuated equilibr ium,' which was specifically formulated in an effort to explain away the embarrassing fossil re cord,\" Meyer said. \"When you look at the issue from the perspective of biologic al information, the best explanat ion is that an intelligence was responsible for this otherw ise inexplicable phenomenon.\" I leaned back in my chair and crossed my legs to get comfortable. \"Thi s sounds fascinating,\" I said. \"Explain what you mean.\" Meyer clearly relished the opportu nity to elaborate. \"New de velopments in embryology and developmental biology are telling us that DNA, as important as it is, is not the whole show,\" Meyer began. \"DNA provides some but not all of the informa tion that's needed to build a new organism with a novel form and functi on. You see, DNA builds proteins , but proteins have to be assembled into larger structures. There are differe nt kinds of cells, and those cells have to be arranged into tissues, and tissues have to be arra nged into organs, and organs have to be arranged into overall body plans. \"According to neo-Darwinism, new biological forms are crea ted from mutations in DNA, with natural selection preserving and building on th e favorable ones. But if DNA is only part of the story, then you can mutate it indefinitely and you'll never build a fundamentally new body architecture. \"So when you encounter the Cambrian explosio n, with its huge and sudden appearance of radically new body plans, you realize you need lots of new biological information. Some of it would be encoded for in DNA-although how that occurs is still an insurmountable problem for Darwinists. But on top of that, where does the new information come from that's not attributable to DNA? How does the hierarchical arrangeme nt of cells, tissues, organs, and body plans develop? Darwinists don't have an answer. It's not even on their radar.\" IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE Using radiometric techniques to date zircon crysta ls in Siberia, scientists have recently been able to increase their accuracy in pinpointi ng the time frame of the Cambrian explosion, whose beginning they have determined to be some 530 million years ago. Paleontologists now think that during a five-million- year (or even shorter) window of time, at least twenty and as many as thirty-five of the world's fort y phyla, the highest category in the animal kingdom, sprang forth with unique body pl ans. In fact, some experts believe that \"all living phyla may have originated by the end of the explosion.\" 30 To put this incredible speed into perspective, if you were to compress all of the Earth's history into twenty-four hours, the Cambrian explosion would consume only about one minute. 31 \"The Cambrian explosion represents an incred ible quantum leap in biological complexity,\" Meyer said. \"Before then, life on Ea rth was pretty simple-one-celle d bacteria, blue-green algae, and later some sponges and primitive worms or mo llusks. Then without any ancestors in the fossil record, we have a stunning variety of comple x creatures appear in the blink of an eye, geologically speaking. \"For example the trilobite-w ith an articulated body, compli cated nervous system, and compound eyes-suddenly shows up fully formed at th e beginning of the expl osion. It's amazing! And this is followed by stasis, which means the ba sic body plans remained distinct over the eons. \"All of this totally contradicts Darwinism, which predicted the slow, gradual development in organisms over time. Darwin admitted the Cambri an explosion was `inexp licable' and `a valid"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"argument' against his theory. He insisted 'natura non facit saltum-nature takes no leaps.' He thought he would be vindicated, ho wever, as more fossils were discovered, but the picture has only gotten worse. \"The big issue is where did the information come from to build all these new proteins, cells, and body plans? For instance, Cambrian animals w ould have needed complex proteins, such as lysyl oxidase. In animals today, lysyl oxi dase molecules require four hundred amino acids. Where did the genetic information come from to build those complicated molecules? This would require highly complex, specified genetic information of the sort that neither random chance, nor natural selection, nor self -organization can produce.\" In my interview for Chapter Three, biologist Jonathan Wells had satisfactorily answered my objections to the Cambrian explosion, one of which was that transitional organisms may have been too small or soft to have left a legacy of fossils. Still, anothe r possibility came to mind. \"Maybe,\" I suggested, \"some unexplained environmental phenome non caused a sudden spate of mutations that accelerated the creation of new organisms.\" \"That doesn't solve the problem,\" Meyer replie d. \"First, even assuming a generous mutation rate, the Cambrian explosion was far too short to have allowed for the kind of large-scale changes that the fossils reflect. \"Second, only mutations in the earliest developm ent of organisms have a realistic chance of producing large-scale macroevolutionary change. And scientists have found that mutations at this stage typically have disa strous effects. The embryo usua lly dies or is crippled.\" Geneticist John F. McDonald has calle d this \"a great Darwinian paradox.\" 32 The kind of mutations that macroevolution needs- namely, large-scale, beneficial ones-don't occur, while the kind it doesn't need-large-scale mutations with harmful effects or smallscale mutations with limited impact-do occur, though infrequently. I brought up another idea that has been o ffered by some evolutionists. \"Why couldn't mutations have occurred in an inactive part of th e DNA, sort of a neutral area that wouldn't have had any immediate impact on the organism?\" I asked. \"Then, after a long period of time during which these mutations could accumulate, a new ge ne sequence could have suddenly kicked in and created an entirely new prot ein. Natural selection would then preserve any beneficial effects this would have on the organism.\" This theory wasn't new to Meyer. He re sponded by saying, \"Keep in mind that these mutations would have had to occur by random chance, since natural sele ction can't preserve anything until it confers a positive benefit on the organism. The problem is that the odds of creating a novel functiona l protein without the help of natu ral selection would be vanishingly small. There are now a number of studies in mo lecular biology that establish this. So this so- called `neutral theory' of e volution is another dead end. \"There's really only one explan ation that accounts for all the evidence. In any other field of endeavor, it would be obvious, but many scientis ts shy away from it in biology. The answer,\" he said, \"is an intelligent designer.\" FITTING THE \"TOP DOWN\" PATTERN The puzzle of the Cambrian Explosion quickly falls into place once the possibility of a purposeful Creator is allowed as one of the e xplanatory options. Even one of the explosion's most vexing features-its so-called \"top down\" pattern of appear ance-is efficiently explained by intelligent design. Said Meyer: \"Neo-Darwinism predicts a `bottom up' pattern in which small differences in"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"form between evolving organisms appear prio r to large differences in form and body plan organization. For instance, you might imagine that pre-Cambrian sponges would have given rise to several different varieties. These varieties would have evolve d over time to produce different species. As this process continued, wholly diffe rent creatures with completely new body plans would have emerged in the Cambrian era. \"Instead, however, fossils from the Cambrian explosion show a radically different `top down' pattern. Major differences in form and body plans appear first, with no simpler transitions before them. Later, some minor variations aris e within the framework of these separate and disparate body plans. \"This has completely stumped neo-Darwinists. Others have tried to explain it away by proposing big leaps of evolutionary change-the so -called punctuated equilibrium idea-but even this can't account for the `t op down' phenomenon. In fact, punc tuated equilibrium predicts a'bottom up' pattern; it just asserts that the increm ents of evolutionary change would be larger. Yet if you postulate intelligent de sign, the `top down' pattern makes sense, because it's the same pattern we see in the history of human technological design.\" \"Can you give me an example?\" I asked. \"Sure-think about cars or airpla nes,\" Meyer replied. \"They also manifest a `top down' pattern of appearance. In both cases, th e major blueprint or plan app ears fairly suddenly and remains essentially constant over history. \"For instance, all cars have a basic organizationa l plan that includes a motor, a drive shaft, two axles, four wheels, and so forth. After the basic invention came about, then variations have occurred on the theme over time. That's an exampl e of `top down' change. The original blueprint was the product of intelligence, and the continu ity through the years is explained by an idea being passed from generation to generation of automotive engineers. \"In a similar way, why couldn't the body plans of the Cambrian animals have originated as an idea in the mind of a designer? This would expl ain why the major differences in form appear first and then subsequent small-sc ale variations only come later. In fact, intelligence is the only cause we know that produces the kind of `top down' pattern we see in both the fossil record and in human technology, as illustrated by everything from cars and airplanes to guns and bicycles. \"Intelligence also explains the origin of the la yers of information necessary to create the new body plans in the Cambrian animals. As I men tioned earlier, to build a new animal you need DNA to create the proteins and additional information to arrange the proteins into higher level structures. We find the same layering or hierarchical form of organization in human technologies, like a computer's circuit board. Humans use in telligence to produce complex components, such as transistors and capacitors , as well as their specific arrangement and c onnection within an integrated circuit. \"Once you allow intelligent design as an op tion, you can quickly see how it accounts for the key features of the Cambrian phenomenon. No other entity explai ns the sudden appearance of such complex new creatures. No other entity produces `top down' patterns. No other entity can create the complex and functionally specific info rmation needed for new living forms. No other explanation suffices.\" \"But intelligent design sounds like such an outmoded concept,\" I said. \"William Paley famously compared biological systems to the work ings of a watch more than two hundred years ago. That's old news. I had struck a nerve. Meyer uncrossed his legs, planted both feet on the floor, and spoke with conviction. \"I think the opposite is true,\" he insisted. \"We've lear ned a lot about biology since the"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Civil War. Evolutionists are still trying to ap ply Darwin's nineteenth -century thinking to a twenty-first century reality, and it's not working. Explanations from the era of the steamboat are no longer adequate to explain the biol ogical world of the information age. \"Darwinists say they're under some sort of epistemological obligation to continue trying, because to invoke design would be to give up on sc ience. Well, I say it's time to redefine science. We should not be looking for only the best naturalistic explanation, but the best explanation, period. And intelligent design is th e explanation that's most in conformity with how the world works.\" A HALLMARK OF MIND As our interview was drawing to a close, Me yer's reference to the twenty-first century prompted one last line of inquiry. \"Fast forward ten or twenty years,\" I said. \"What do you see?\" \"I think the information revolution taking pl ace in biology is sounding the death knell for Darwinism and chemical evolutionary theories,\" he said as he removed his glasses and slipped them into his pocket. \"The attempt to explain the origin of life sole ly from chemical constituents is effectively dead now. Naturalism cannot answer the fundame ntal problem of how to get from matter and energy to biological function without the infu sion of information from an intelligence. \"Information is not something derived from mate rial properties; in a sense, it transcends matter and energy. Naturalistic theories that rely solely on matter and energy are not going to be able to account for information. Only intellig ence can. I think that re alization is going to progressively dawn on more and more people, es pecially younger scientists who have grown up in the age of information technology. \"Today we buy information, we sell it, we regard it as a commo dity, we value it, we send it down wires and bounce it off satellite s-and we know it invariably co mes from intelligent agents. So what do we make of the fact that there's in formation in life? What do we make of the fact that DNA stores far more information in a smalle r space than the most advanced supercomputer on the planet? \"Information is the hallmark of mind. And purely from the evid ence of genetics and biology, we can infer the existence of a mind that's fa r greater than our own- a conscious, purposeful, rational, intelligent designer who's amazi ngly creative. There's no getting around it.\" The cacophony of street noise coming through the half-opened window was getting louder now that rush hour was approaching. Meyer's wi fe was graciously cooking a salmon dinner for us at their house, and it was time to get on the highway before it got clogged with traffic. As we ended our discussion, Meyer excused himself for a quick meeting in another office, giving me some time to reflect. Meyer's two rhetorical questions near the c onclusion of our discussion effectively summed up the issue. The data at the core of life is not disorganized, it's not simply orderly like salt crystals, but it's complex and specific informa tion that can accomplish a bewildering task-the building of biological machines that far outstrip human technological capabilities. What else can generate information but inte lligence? What else can account for the rapid appearance of a staggering variety of fully formed , complex creatures that have absolutely no transitional intermediates in the fossil record? The conclusion was compelling: an intelligent entity has quite literally spelled out evidence of his existence thr ough the four chemic al letters in the genetic code. It's almost as if the Creator autographed every cell. I sighed and slumped back in my chair, a bit exhausted from my wh irlwind of travel and"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"interviews. The case for a Creator was accumulati ng at a remarkable pace, and I could sense I was approaching the conclusion of my quest. But I also knew there was at least one more expert I needed to consult. In the closing minutes of our conversation, Meyer had mentioned the word \"mind\" and referred to conscious activity. As beguiled as I was by DNA, I was e qually intrigued by the human brain. Weighing just three pounds, it has ten thousand million nerve cells, each sending out enough fibers to create a thousand million millio n connections. That's equal to the number of leaves in a dense forest covering a million square miles. 34 Yet how does all of that circuitry create th e unique phenomenon of human consciousness? How does raw biological processing power enable me to reflect, or form beliefs, or make free choices? Is my consciousness only attributable to the physics and chemistry of my brain, or have I also been endowed with an immaterial mind and soul? And if there is pe rsuasive evidence of a soul, what could this tell me about the existence of a Creator-and an afterlife? I pulled out a small notebook and scribbled myself a note to contact an expert on consciousness as soon as I returned to Los Angeles. I started to slip the pad into my shirt pocket, but instead I stopped and looked at the reminder I had just written. It was also a reminder of something else. Those few words-a fragment of a sentence- represented information that has its source in my intelligence. How intuitively obvious that a dense array of far more complicat ed biological assembly instructions must, too, have their origin in a mind.

No one, certainly not the Darwinian as such, seems to have any answer to this.... The point is that there is no scientific answer. Darwinist philosopher Michael Ruse The intelligence of machines will exceed human intelligence early in this century,\" predicted techno-prophet Ray Kurzweil, re cipient of the prestigious Na tional Medal of Technology and called \"the ultimate thinking machine\" by Forbes. \"By intelligence, I include all of the diverse and subtle ways in which humans are intell igent-including musical and artistic aptitude, creativity, physically moving, and even responding to emotion. `By 2019, a thousand-dollar computer will match the processing power of the human brain.... By 2050, a thousand dollars of computing will equa l the processing power of all human brains on Earth.... Will these future machines be capable of having spiritual experiences? They certainly will claim to. They will claim to be people, and to have the full range of emotional and spiritual experiences that people claim to have.\" 2 In envisioning the future, Kurzweil's book The Age of Spiritual Machines raises the controversial question of whethe r computers will not only become smarter than people but might also achieve consciousness-and thus become virt ually indistinguishable from their biologically based counterparts. In a sense, Kurzweil's theories are a logical extension of Darwinian evolution. According to Darwinists, the physical world is all that there is. At some poin t, the human brain evolved, with its raw processing power increasing over the eons. When the brain reached a certain level of"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"structure and complexity, people became \"con scious\"-that is, they suddenly developed subjectivity, feelings, hopes, a point of view, sel f-awareness, introspection, that \"hidden voice of our private selves.\" As far back as 1871, Darwin advocate Thomas Huxley said: \"Mind [or consciousness] is a function of matter, when that matter has at tained a certain degr ee of organization.\" 3 Darwinists today agree that \"conscious experience is a phys ical and not a supernatural phenomenon,\" as sociobiologist Edward 0. Wilson said.` If consciousness really is the automatic byproduct of increasi ngly sophisticated brain power, then why couldn't super-smart robots become conscious when they achieve a bigger brain capacity than people? Once the basic Darwinian pr emise is accepted, then Kurzweil's futuristic scenario suddenly seems possible. \"If you can get a computer to take on any structure you like, and if consciousness is generated by structure, then by de finition that kind of structure is going to eventually give you consciousness,\" said David Chalmers, codirector of the Center for Consciousness Studies at the University of Arizona. Kurzweil's predictions, however, have been assailed by critics who say computer consciousness is absurd. \"I ca nnot recall reading a book in which there is such a huge gulf between the spectacular claims advanced and th e weakness of the argu ments given in their support,\" scoffed John Searle, a professor of mind at the University of California at Berkeley. 6 \"You can expand the power all you want, hooking up as many computers as you think you need, and they still won't be conscious, because all they'll ever do is shuffle symbols.\" 7 Said William Dembski of the Conceptual Foundations of Science at Baylor University: \"Kurzweil is peddling scien ce fiction and bad philosophy.\" 8 As fascinating as this debate over futuristic computers has been, there still remains a much more important controversy over human consciousness. Amazingly, many scientists and philosophers are now concluding that the laws of physics and chemistry cannot explain the experience of consciousness in human beings. They ar e convinced that there is more than just the physical brain at work, but there also is a nonmaterial reality called the \"soul,\" \"mind,\" or \"self\" that accounts for our sentience. In fact, they cite its very existence as strong evidence against the purely naturalistic theory of Darwinian evolution and in favor of a Cr eator who imbued humankind with his image. THE CONTROVERSY OVER CONSCIOUSNESS One scientist whose opinions were reversed on the issue is Wilder Penfield, the renowned father of modern neurosurgery. He started out suspecting that consciousness somehow emanated from the neural activities in the brain, where syna pses can fire an astounding ten million billion times a second. \"Through my own scie ntific career, I, like other scientists, have struggled to prove that the brain accounts for the mind,\" he said. 9 But through performing surgery on more than a thousand epileptic pati ents, he encountered concrete evidence that the brain and mind are actually distinct from each other, although they clearly interact. Explained one expert in the field: Penfield would stimulate electrically the pr oper motor cortex of conscious patients and challenge them to keep one hand from movi ng when the current was applied. The patient would seize this hand with the other hand a nd struggle to hold it still. Thus one hand under the control of the elect rical current and the other hand under the control of the patient's mind fought against each other. Penfie ld risked the explanation that the patient"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"had not only a physical brain that was stimulated to ac tion but also a nonphysical reality that interacted with the brain.\" In other words, Penfield ended up agreeing with the Bible's assertion that human beings are both body and spirit. \"To expect th e highest brain mechanism or any set of reflexes, however complicated, to carry out what the mind does, and thus perform all the functions of the mind, is quite absurd,\" he said. \"What a thrill it is, then, to discover that the scientis t, too, can legitimately believe in the existence of the spirit.\" Similarly, Oxford University professor of physiology Sir Charles Sherrington, a Nobel Prize winner described as \"a genius who laid the f oundations of our knowledge of the functioning of the brain and spinal cord,\" 11 declared five days before his deat h: \"For me now, the only reality is the human soul.\" 14 As for his one-time student John C. Eccles, himself an eminent neurophysiologist and Nobel laureate, his ultimate conclusion is the same. \"I am constrained,\" he said, \"to believe that there is what we might call a supernatural origin of my unique se lf-conscious mind or my unique selfhood or soul.\"' But is it really rational in the twenty-first century to believe in John Calvin's sixteenth- century claim that \"the endowments we possess cannot possibly he from ourselves,\" but that they must have a divine source? 16 Is the Bible's insistence that peop le consist of both body and spirit-a belief called \"dualism\"-a defensible assertion? 17 Or is the human brain simply, in the famous words of MIT's Marvin Minsky, \"a computer ma de of meat,\" with c onscious thought as its wholly mechanical output? Consciousness, declared Searle, is \"the single most important fact about our existence, except for life itself.\" 18 It was clear to me that the answer to the mystery of our mind would either be a powerful confirmation of Darwinian na turalism or a persuasive affirmation of a far greater mind in whose likeness we were created. SURPASSING THE BRAIN'S BOUNDARIES It was a news dispatch from the front lines of the scientific investigation of human consciousness. Published by the journal Resuscitation and presented to scientists at the California Institute of Technology in 2001, the y ear-long British study provided evidence that consciousness continues after a person's brain has stopped functio ning and he or she has been declared clinically dead. 19 It was dramatic new evidence that the brain and mind are not the same, but they're distinct entities. \"The research,\" said Reuters journalist Sarah Tippit, \"resurrects the debate over whether there is life after death and whether th ere is such a thing as the human soul.\" 20 In their journal article, physician Sam Parnia and Peter Fenwick, a neuropsychiatrist at the Institute of Psychiatry in L ondon, describe their study of sixty- three heart attack victims who were declared clinically dead but were later revived and interviewed. About ten percent reported having well-structured, lucid t hought processes, with memory formation and reasoning, during the time that their brains were not functioni ng. The effects of oxygen starvation or drugs- objections commonly offered by skeptics-were ruled out as factors. Later, the researchers found numerous cases that were similar. 21 While large-scale studies are still needed, the once-skeptical Parnia said the scientific findings so far \"would support the view that mi nd, `consciousness,' or the `soul' is a separate entity from the brain. \"22"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"He speculated that the brain might serve as a mechanism to manifest the mind, much in the same way a television set manifests pictures and sounds from waves in the air. If an injury to the brain causes a person to lose some aspects of hi s mind or personality, this doesn't necessarily prove that the brain was the source of the mind. \"A ll it shows is that the apparatus is damaged,\" he said. Active research is continuing in this area and into other aspects of human consciousness. 24 Meanwhile, the scientists who are committed to finding a purely physical answer-appropriately called \"physicalists\"-are candid in admitting that they currently have no explanation for how the brain might spawn consciousness. Conceded Searle: \"We don't have an adequate theory of how the brain causes conscious states, and we don't have an adequate theory of how consciousness fits into the universe.\" 2 ' Still, Searle and many others find refuge in th eir unshakable faith that science will eventually discover a completely naturalis tic explanation. Given Darwinis m as a non-negotiable starting point, there's really no other choice. \"I am firmly in the confident camp-a substant ial explanation for the mind's emergence from the brain will be produced and perhaps soon,\" predicted professor of neurology Antonio R. Damasio. \"The giddy feeling, however, is temper ed by the acknowledgment of some sobering difficulties.\" 26 Eccles calls this kind of att itude \"promissory materialism ... extravagant and unfulfillable.\" 27 Instead, many researchers are following Eccles's example by pursuing the evidence of science and the logic of philosophy wherever they lead, even if they point toward dualism. Said anthropologist Marilyn Schlitz: I would take the position of a radical empirici st, in that I am driv en by data, not theory. And the data I see tell me that there are wa ys in which people's experience refutes the physicalist position that the mind is the brai n and nothing more. Ther e are solid, concrete data that suggest that our consciousness, our mind, may surpass the boundaries of the brain. 28 As for the Bible, both the Old and New Testaments consistently teach that humans are \"a hyphenate creature, a spirit/body dichotomy,\" said anthropologist Arthur C. Custance. Then, quite significantly, he added: \"To this exte nt there is no quarrel between theology and the findings of recent research.\" 20 Custance continued: [The Bible] makes it very clear that when the soul or spirit leaves the body, the body is dead and that if the spirit is somehow re turned to the body, the w hole person comes back to life. 30 This duality is repeated in hundreds of places in the Bible 31 .... Indeed the formation of Adam as the first human being is expressly stated as the result of the animation of a body by a spirit, c onstituting it as a living sou1. 32 Do Christianity and contemporary research really support each other, wh ile at the same time contradicting the Darwinian claim that the brain is solely responsible for consciousness? As I went looking for answers, I didn't have to travel far from my home in Sout hern California. It was just a short drive to the house of a prominent professor trai ned in science, philosophy, and theology, who has pondered and written about these topics for years. INTERVIEW #8: J. P.

The setting was familiar to me, since I had previously interviewed him on other challenging topics for The Case for Christ and The Case for Faith. 33 Both times I found him to have an uncanny ability to discuss abstract issues and technical matters in understandable but accurate language.

He then earned a master's degree in theology at Dallas Theological Seminary and a doctorate in philosophy at the University of Southern California. Moreland developed an early interest in issues relating to hu man consciousness, returning to that theme time after time in his various books.

As we began our interview, I thought it woul d be a good idea to get straight on some key definitions-something that's not always easy when discussing consciousness. REGAINING CONSCIOUSNESS U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewar t once said it may be difficult to define pornography, \"but I know it when I see it.\" 34 Similarly, consciousness can be a challenging concept to describe, even though our own conscious thoughts are quite tangible to ourselves. As J. R. Smythies of the University of Edinburgh put it: \"The consciousness of other people may be for me an abstraction, but my own consciousness is for me a reality.\" 3 \"What is consciousness?\" Moreland said, echoing the opening question that I had just posed to him. \"Well, a simple definition is that consciousness is what you're aware of when you introspect. When you pay attention to what's going on inside of you, that's consciousness.\" He looked at me and apparently could see from my expression that I needed a fuller description. \"Think of it like this,\" he continued. \"Suppose you were having an operation on your leg, and suddenly you begin to be aware of peop le talking about you. Someone says, `I think he's recovering.' You start to feel an ache in your knee. You say to yourself, `Where am I? What's going on?' And you start to remember you were ope rated on. What you're doing is regaining con- sciousness. In short, consciousness consists of sensations, thoughts, emotions, desires, beliefs, and free choices that make us alive and aware.\" \"What if consciousness didn't exist in the world?\" I asked. \"I'll give you an example,\" Moreland replied. \"Apples would still be red, but there would be"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"no awareness of red or any sensations of red.\" \"What about the soul?\" I asked. \"How would you define that?\" \"The soul is the ego, the `I,' or the self, and it contains our consciousness. It also animates our body. That's why when the soul leaves th e body, the body becomes a corpse. The soul is immaterial and distinct from the body.\" \"At least,\" I observed, \"that' s what the Bible teaches.\" \"Yes, Christians have understood this for twenty centuries,\" he said. \"For example, when Jesus was on the cross, he told the thief being crucified next to him that he would be with Jesus immediately after his death and before the final resurrection of his body. 36 Jesus described the body and soul as being separate entities when he said, `Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul.\"' The apostle Paul says that to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.\" 38 I was curious about whether belief in the soul is a universal phenomenon. \"What about beyond Christianity?\" I asked. \"Is this concep t present in other cultures as well?\" \"We know that dualism was taught by the anci ent Greeks, although, unlike Christians, they believed the body and soul were alien toward each other,\" he explained. \"In contemporary terms, I'd agree with physicalist Jaegwon Kim, who ac knowledged that `something like this dualism of personhood, I believe, is common lore shared acr oss most cultures and religious traditions.\"' 39 Still, there are those who deny dualism and instead believe we are solely physical beings who are, as geneticist Francis Cr ick said, \"no more than the behavi or of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their a ssociated molecules.\" 40 To explore this issue, I decided to take an unusual approach in my interview with Moreland by asking him to imagine-for just a few minutes-that these physicalists are right. WHAT IF PHYSICALISM IS TRUE? \"Let's face it,\" I said, \"some people flatly deny that we have an immaterial soul. John Searle said, `In my worldview, consciousne ss is caused by brain processes.' 41 In other words, they believe consciousness is purely a product of biol ogy. As brain scientist Barry Beyerstein said, just as the kidneys produce urine, the brain produces consciousness.\" 42 Moreland was listening car efully as I spoke, his head sligh tly cocked. I continued by saying, \"Do me a favor, J. P.-assume for a moment that the physicalists are right. What are the logical implications if physicalism is true?\" His eyes widened. \"Oh, there would be several key ones,\" he replied. \"Give me three,\" I said. Moreland was more than willing. \"First, if phy sicalism is true, then consciousness doesn't really exist, because there would be no such thi ng as conscious states that must be described from a first-person point of view,\" he said. \"You see, if everything were matter, then you could capture the entire universe on a graph- you could locate each star, the moon, every mounta in, Lee Strobel's brain, Lee Strobel's kidneys, and so forth. That's because if everything is phys ical, it could be describe d entirely from a third- person point of view. And yet we know that we have firstperson, subjective points of view-so physicalism can't be true.\" Clearly, Moreland was warming up to this exerci se. \"The second implication,\" he continued, \"is that there would be no free will. That's because matter is completely governed by the laws of nature. Take any physical object,\" he said as he glanced out the window, where the fog was breaking up. \"For instance, a cloud,\" he said. \"It' s just a material object, and its movement is"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"completely governed by the laws of air pressu re, wind movement, and the like. So if I'm a material object, all of the things I do are fixed by my environm ent, my genetics, and so forth. \"That would mean I'm not really free to make choices. Whatever's goi ng to happen is already rigged by my makeup and environment. So how c ould you hold me responsible for my behavior if I wasn't free to choose how I would act? This is one of the reasons we lost the Vietnam War.\" I was following him until that last statement, which seemed oddly incongruous to me. \"What has this got to do with Vietnam?\" I asked. Moreland explained: \"I heard a former adviso r to the president say that B. F. Skinner's behaviorism influenced the Pentagon's strategy. Skinner believed that we're just physical objects, so you can condition people, just like you can cond ition a laboratory animal by applying electric shocks. Keep doing certain things over and over, and you can change behavior. So in Vietnam, we bombed, we came back, we bombed, we came back, we bombed, and so forth. We assumed that after we gave the North Vietnamese shoc k after shock, pretty so on we could manipulate their behavior. After all, they'r e just physical objects responding to stimuli. Eventually they had to give in.\" \"But they didn't,\" I said. \"That's right. It didn't work.\" \"Why?\" \"Because there was more to the Vietnamese than their physical brains responding to stimuli. They have souls, desires, feelings, and beliefs, and they could make free choices to suffer and to stand firm for their convictions despite our attempt to condition them by our bombing. \"So if the materialists are right, kiss free w ill good-bye. In their view, we're just very complicated computers that behave according to the laws of nature and the programming we receive. But, Lee, obviously they're wrong-we do have free will. We all know that deep down inside. We're more than just a physical brain. \"Third, if physicalism were true, there woul d be no disembodied intermediate state. According to Christianity, when we die, ou r souls leave our bodies and await the later resurrection of our bodies from the dead. We d on't cease to exist when we die. Our souls are living on. \"This happens in near-d eath experiences. People are clinically dead, but sometimes they have a vantage point from above, where they lo ok down at the operating ta ble that their body is on. Sometimes they gain information they couldn't have known if this were just an illusion happening in their brain. One woman died and she saw a tennis shoe that was on the roof of the hospital. How could she have known this? \"If I am just my brain, then existing outside the body is utterly impossible. When people hear of near-death experiences, they don't think that if they looked up at the hospital ceiling, they'd see a pulsating brain with a couple of eyeballs dangling down, right? When people hear near- death stories, Lee, they are intu itively attributing to that pers on a soul that could leave the body. And clearly these stories make sense, even if we're not sure they're true. We've got to be more than our bodies or else these stor ies would be ludicrous to us.\" Moreland seemed to be sideste pping this issue a bit. \"How about you personally?\" I asked. \"Do you think near-death experiences are true?\" \"We have to be careful with the data and not overstate things, but I do think they provide at least a minimalist case for consciousness surviving d eath,\" he said. \"In fact, as far back as 1965, psychologist John Beloff wrote in The Humanist that the evidence of near-death experiences already indicates `a dualistic world where mind or spirit has an existence separate from the world"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"of material things.' He conceded that this could `pre sent a challenge to hu manism as profound in its own way as that which Darwinian evolut ion did to Christianity a century ago.\"' 43 Moreland paused before adding one other co mment. \"Regardless of what anyone thinks about near-death experiences, we do have confirma tion that Jesus was put to death and was later seen alive by credible eyewitnesses,\" he said. 44 \"Not only does this provide powerful historical corroboration that it's possible to survive after the death of our physical body, but it also gives Jesus great credibility when he teaches that we have both a body and an immaterial spirit.\" THE INNER AND PRIVATE MIND At this point, having considered Moreland's critique of physic alism, I wanted to hear his affirmative case that consciousness and the soul are immaterial entities. \"What positive evidence is there that consciousness and th e self are not merely a physical process of the brain?\" I asked. \"We have experimental data, for one thing,\" he replied. \"For example, neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield electrically stimulated the brains of epilepsy patients and found he could cause them to move their arms or legs, turn their heads or eyes , talk, or swallow. Invariably the patient would respond by saying, `I didn't do that. You did.' According to Penfield, `the patient thinks of himself as having an existence separate from his body.' \"No matter how much Penfield probed the cerebral cortex, he said, `There is no place ... where electrical stimulation will cause a patient to believe or to decide.' 47 That's because those functions originate in the c onscious self, not the brain. \"A lot of subsequent research has validated this. When Roger Sperry and his team studied the differences between the brain's right and le ft hemispheres, they discovered the mind has a causal power independent of the brain's activities. This led Sperry to conclude materialism was false.' 4 \"Another study showed a delay between the time an electric shock was applied to the skin, its reaching the cerebral cortex, and the self-conscious percepti on of it by the person. 49 This suggests the self is more than just a machine that reacts to stimuli as it re ceives them. In fact, the data from various research projects are so re markable that Laurence C. Wood said, `many brain scientists have been co mpelled to postulate th e existence of an imma terial mind, even though they may not embrace a belief in an after-life.\"' \"What about beyond the laboratory?\" I asked. \"There are valid philosophical arguments as we ll,\" he said. \"For instance, I know that consciousness isn't a physical phenomenon because there are things that are true of my consciousness that aren't tr ue of anything physical.\" \"For instance . . . ,\" I said, prompting him further. \"For example, some of my thoughts have the attr ibute of being true. Tragically, some of my thoughts have the attribute of be ing false-like the Chicago Bears are going to go to the Super Bowl,\" he said with a chuckle. \"However, none of my brain states are true or false. No scientist can look at the state of my brain and say, `Oh, that particular brain state is true and that one's false.' So there's something true of my conscious st ates that are not true of any of my brain states, and consequently they can't be the same thing. \"Nothing in my brain is about anything. You can't open up my head and say, `You see this electrical pattern in th e left hemisphere of J. P. Moreland's brain? That's about the Bears.' Your brain states aren't about anything, but some of my mental states are. So they're different. \"Furthermore, my consciousness is inner and priv ate to me. By simply introspecting, I have a"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"way of knowing about what's happe ning in my mind that is not available to you, my doctor, or a neuroscientist. A scientist could know more about what's happening in my brain than I do, but he couldn't know more about what's happening in my mind than I do. He has to ask me.\" When I asked Moreland for an illustration of this, he said. \"Have you heard of Rapid Eye Movement?\" \"Sure,\" I replied. \"What does it indicate?\" \"Dreaming.\" \"Exactly. How do scientists know that when ther e is a certain eye movement that people are dreaming? They've had to wake people and ask th em. Scientists could watch the eyes move and read a printout of what was physic ally happening in the brain, so they could correlate brain states with eye movements. But they didn't know wh at was happening in the mind. Why? Because that's inner and private. \"So the scientist can know about the brain by studying it, but he can't know about the mind without asking the person to reveal it, because c onscious states have the feature of being inner and private, but the brain's states don't.\" THE REALITY OF THE SOUL For centuries, the human soul has enchanted poets, intrigued theologians, challenged philosophers, and dumbfounded scientists. Mystics, lik e Teresa of Avila in the sixteenth century, have described it eloquently: \"I began to think of the soul as if it were a castle made of a single diamond or of very clear crystal, in which there are many rooms, just as in heaven there are many mansions.\" 51 Moreland was understandably more precise in an alyzing the soul, thoug h unfortunately less poetic. He had already clarified that the soul co ntains our consciousness. Still, he hadn't offered any reason to believe that the soul is an actual en tity. It was time, I felt, to press him on this issue. \"What makes you think that the soul is real?\" I asked. Moreland replied by saying, \"First, we're aware th at we're different from our consciousness and our body. We know that we're beings who have consciousness and a body, but we're not merely the same thing as our conscious life or our physical life. \"Let me give you an illustration of how we're not the same thing as our personality traits, our memories, and our consciousness. I had a student a few years ago whose sister had a terrible accident on her honeymoon. She was knocked unconscious and lost all of her memories and a good bit of her personality. She di d not believe she had been marri ed. As she began to recover, they showed her videos of the wedding to co nvince her that she ha d actually married her husband. She eventually got to th e point where she believed it, and she got remarried to him. \"Now, we all knew this was the same person all along. This was Jamie's sister. She was not a different person, though she was behaving different ly. But she had totally different memories. She had lost her old memories and she didn't even have the same personality. What that proves is you can be the same person even if you lose old memories and gain new memories, or you lose some of your old personality traits and gain new personality traits. \"Now, if I were just my consciousness, wh en my consciousness was different, I'd be a different person. But we know that I can be the same person even though my consciousness changes, so I can't be the same thing as my consciousness. I've got to be the `self,' or soul, that contains my consciousness. \"Same with my body. I can't be the same thing as my body or brain. There was a story on"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"television about an epileptic w ho underwent an operation in which surgeons removed fifty-three percent of her brain. When she woke up, nobody sai d, `We have forty-seven percent of a person here.' A person can't be divided into pieces. You are either a person or you're not. But your brain and your body can be divided. So that means I can't be the same thing as my body.\" Those illustrations helped, though I said, \"The fact that the soul and consciousness are invisible makes it difficult to conceptualize them.\" \"Sure, that's true,\" he replied. \"My soul a nd my consciousness are invisible, though my body is visible. That's another dis tinction. In fact, I remember the time when my daughter was in the fifth grade and we were having family prayers. She said, `Da d, if I could see God, it would help me believe in him.' I said, `Well, honey, the problem isn't that you've never seen God. The problem is that you've never seen your mother.' And her mother was sitting right next to her! \"My daughter said, `What do you mean, Dad?' I said, `Suppose without hurting your mom, we were able to take her apart cell by cell a nd peek inside each one of them. We would never come to a moment where we would say, 'Look -here's what Mommy's thinking about doing the rest of the day.' Or `Hey, this cell contains Mommy's feelings.' Or `So this is what Mom believes about pro football.' We couldn' t find Mommy's thoughts, beliefs, desires, or her feelings. \"`Guess what else we would never find? We'd never find Mo mmy's ego or her self. We would never say, `Finally, in this particular brain cell, there's Mommy. There's her ego, or self.' That's because Mommy is a person, and persons are invisible. Mommy's ego and her conscious life are invisible. Now, she's small enough to ha ve a body, while God is too big to have a body- so let's pray!' \"The point is this, Lee: I am a soul, and I have a body. We don't learn about people by studying their bodies. We learn abou t people by finding out how they feel, what they think, what they're passionate about, what th eir worldview is, and so forth. St aring at their body might tell us whether they like exercise, but that's not very help ful. That's why we want to get `inside' people to learn about them. \"So my conclusion is that there' s more to me than my consci ous life and my body. In fact, I am a `self,' or an `I,' that cannot be seen or touched unless I mani fest myself through my behavior or my talk. I have free will because I'm a `self,' or a soul, and I'm not just a brain.\" OF COMPUTERS AND BATS Moreland's denial that the brain produces c onsciousness made me think of the debate over whether future computers can become sentient. I decided to ask him to weigh in on the issue- although his ultimate conclusion was never in doubt. \"If a machine can achieve equal or greater brain power as human beings, then some physicalists say the computer would become cons cious,\" I said. \"I assu me you would disagree with that.\" Moreland chuckled. \"One atheist said that when computers reach the point of imitating human behavior, only a racist w ould deny them full human rights. But of course that's absurd. Nobel-winner John Eccles said he's `appalled by the naivete' of thos e who foresee computer sentience. He said there's `no evidence whatsoever for the statement made that, at an adequate level of complexity, computers also would achieve self-consciousness. ' \"Look, we have to remember that computers ha ve artificial intelligen ce, not intelligence. And there's a huge difference. There's no `what it' s like to be a computer.' A computer has no `insides,' no awareness, no first-person point of view, no insights into problems. A computer doesn't think, `You know what? I now see what this multiplication problem is really like.' A"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"computer can engage in behavior if it's wire d properly, but you've got to remember that consciousness is not the same as behavior. Consciousne ss is being alive; it's what causes behavior in really conscious bei ngs. But what causes behavior in a computer is electric circuitry. \"Let me illustrate my point. Suppose we had a computerized bat that we knew absolutely everything about from a physical point of view. We would have exhausti ve knowledge of all its circuitry so that we could pred ict everything this bat would do when it was released into the environment. \"Contrast that with a real ba t. Suppose we knew everything about the organs inside the bat- its blood system, nervous system, brain, heart, lungs. And suppose that we could predict everything this bat would do when released into the environment. There would still be one thing that we would have no idea about: what it's like to be a bat. What it's like to hear, to feel, to experience sound and color. That st uff involves the `insides' of the bat, its point of view. That's the difference between a conscious, sen tient bat and a computerized bat. \"So in general, computers might be able to im itate intelligence, but they won't ever have consciousness. We can't confuse behavior with what it's like to be alive, awake, and sentient. A future superintelligent computer might be programmed to say it's conscious or even behave as if it were conscious, but it can never truly become conscious, because consciousness is an immaterial entity apart from the brain.\" Moreland's choice of a bat for his illustration was an oblique reference to New York University philosopher Thomas Nagel's famous 1974 essay \"What Is it Like to Be a Bat? \" Thinking about life from a bat's perspective pr ompted me to briefly pursue another line of inquiry on a tangential topic. \"What about animals-do they have souls or consciousness?\" I asked. \"Absolutely,\" came his quick answer. \"In several places the Bible uses the word `soul' or `spirit' when discussing animals. Animals are not simply machines. They have consciousness and points of view. But the animal soul is much simpler than the human soul. For example, the human soul is capable of free moral action, but I think the animal soul is determined. Also, Augustine said animals have thoughts, but they don't think about their thinking. And while we have beliefs about our beliefs, animals don't. \"You see, the human soul is vastly more comp licated because it's made in the image of God. So we have self-reflection and self-thinking. And wh ile the human soul survives the death of its body, I don't think the animal soul outlives its body. I could be wrong, but I think the animal soul ceases to exist at death.\" Bad news, it seems, for the bat. CONSCIOUSNESS AND EVOLUTION Moreland had made a cogent case for conscious ness and the soul bei ng independent of our brain and body. \"How does this present a problem for Darwinists?\" I asked. Moreland glanced down at some notes he had brought along. \"As philosopher Geoffrey Medell said, `The emergence of consciousness, then, is a mystery, and one to which materialism fails to provide an answer.' Atheist Colin McGinn agrees. He asks, `How can mere matter originate consciousness? How did evolution convert the water of biological tissue into the wine of consciousness? Consciousness seems like a radi cal novelty in the universe, not prefigured by the aftereffects of the Big Bang. So how did it contrive to spring into being from what preceded it?\"'"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Moreland looked squarely at me. \"Here's the point: you can't get something from nothing,\" he declared. \"It's as simple as that. If there were no God, then the history of the entire universe, up until the appearance of living creatures, w ould be a history of dead matter with no consciousness. You would not have any thoughts, beliefs, feelings, sens ations, free actions, choices, or purposes. There would be simply on e physical event after a nother physical event, behaving according to the laws of physics and chemistry.\" Moreland stopped for a moment to make sure th is picture was vivid in my mind. Then he leaned forward and asked pointedly: \"How, then, do you get something totally different- conscious, living, thinking, feeling, believing creatures-from ma terials that don't have that? That's getting something from nothing! And that's the main problem. \"If you apply a physical process to physical matter, you're going to get a different arrangement of physical materials. For example, if you apply the physical process of heating to a bowl of water, you're going to get a new product-steam -which is just a more complicated form of water, but it's still physical. And if the history of the universe is just a story of physical processes being applied to physical materials, you'd end up with increasingly complicated arrangements of physical materials, but you're not going to get so mething that's completely nonphysical. That is a jump of a totally different kind. \"At the end of the day, as Phillip Johnson put it, you either have `In the beginning were the particles,' or `In the beginning was the Logos,' which means `divine mi nd.' If you start with particles, and the history of the universe is just a story about the rearrangement of particles, you may end up with a more complicated arrangement of particles, but you're still going to have particles. You're not going to have minds or consciousness. \"However-and this is really important-if you begin with an infinite mind, then you can explain how finite minds could come into existence. That makes sense. What doesn't make sense-and which many atheistic evol utionists are conceding-is the idea of getting a mind to squirt into existence by starting with brute, dead, mindle ss matter. That's why some of them are trying to get rid of consciousness by saying it's not real and that we're just computers.\" He smiled after that last statement, then adde d: \"However, that's a pretty difficult position to maintain while you're conscious!\" THE EMERGENCE OF THE MIND \"Still,\" I protested, \"some scientists maintain that consciousness is just something that happens as a natural byproduct of our brain's complexity. They believe that once evolution gave us sufficient brain capacity, consciousness in exorably emerges as a biological process.\" \"Let me mention four problems with that,\" Moreland insisted. \"Fir st, they are no longer treating matter as atheists and naturalists treat matter-namely, as brute stuff that can be completely described by the laws of chemis try and physics. Now they're attributing spooky, soulish, or mental potentials to matter.\" \"What do you mean by `potentials'?\" \"They're saying that prior to this level of co mplexity, matter contained the potential for mind to emerge-and at the right moment, guess what happened? These potentials were activated and consciousness was sparked into existence.\" \"What's wrong with that theory?\" \"That is no longer naturalism,\" he said. \"That's panpsychism.\" That was a new term to me. \"Pan what?\" \"Panpsychism,\" he repeated. \"It's the view that matter is not just inert physical stuff, but that"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"it also contains proto-mental states in it. Sudde nly, they've abandoned a strict scientific view of matter and adopted a view that's closer to theism than to athe ism. Now they're saying that the world began not just with matter, but with stuff that's mental and physical at the same time. Yet they can't explain where these pre-emergent ment al properties came from in the first place. And this also makes it hard for them to argue against the emergence of God.\" \"The emergence of God?\" I asked. \"What do you mean by that?\" \"If a finite mind can emerge wh en matter reaches a certain leve l of complexity, why couldn't a far greater mind-God-emerge when millions of brain states reach a greater level of consciousness? You see, they want to stop the pro cess where they want it to stop-at themselves- but you can't logically draw that line. How can th ey know that a very large God hasn't emerged from matter, because, after all, haven't a lot of people had religious experiences with God?\" \"That wouldn't be the God of Christianity,\" I pointed out. \"Granted,\" he replied. \"But th is is still a problem for atheis ts. And there's a second problem: they would still be stuck with determinism, b ecause if consciousness is just a function of the brain, then I'm my brain, and my brain functions according to the laws of chemistry and physics. To them, the mind is to the brain as smoke is to fire. Fire causes smoke, but smoke doesn't cause anything. It's just a byproduct. Thus, they're locked into determinism. \"Third, if mind emerged from matter without th e direction of a superi or Intelligence, why should we trust anything from the mind as being rational or true, especi ally in the area of theoretical thinking? \"Let me give you an analogy. Let's say you had a computer that was programmed by random forces or by nonrational laws without a mind being behind it. Would you trust a printout from that machine? Of course not. Well, same with the mind-and that's a problem for Darwinists. And by the way, you can't use evolution as an explan ation for why the mind should be considered trustworthy, because theoretical thinking does not contribute to survival value.\" Moreland's comments reminded me of the famous quote from British evolutionist J. B. S. Haldane: \"If my mental processes are determined wholly by the motions of the atoms in my brain, I have no reason to suppose that my belie fs are true ... and hence I have no reason for supposing my brain to be composed of atoms.\" 55 \"Here's the fourth problem,\" Moreland went on, \"If my mind were ju st a function of the brain, there would be no unified self. Remember, brain function is spread throughout the brain, so if you cut the brain in half, like the girl who lost fi fty-three percent of he r brain, then some of that function is lost. Now you've got forty-se ven percent of a person. Well, nobody believes that. We all know she's a unified self, because we a ll know her consciousness a nd soul are separate entities from her brain. \"There's one other aspect of this, called the `binding problem.' When you look around the room, you see many things at the same time,\" he said, gesturing around at various objects in our field of vision. \"You see a table, a couch, a wall, a painting in a frame. Every individual thing has light waves bouncing off of it and they're st riking a different locatio n in your eyeball and sparking electrical activity in a di fferent region of the brain. That m eans there is no single part of the brain that is activated by all of these experien ces. Consequently, if I were simply my physical brain, I would be a crowd of different parts, each having its own awareness of a different piece of my visual field. `But that's not what happens. I'm a unified `I' that has all of these experiences at the same time. There is something that binds all of these experiences and unifies th em into the experience of oneselfme-even though there is no region of the brain that has all these activation sites. That's"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"because my consciousness and my `self' are separate entities from the brain.\" Moreland was on a roll, but I jumped in anyway. \"What about recent brain studies that have shown activity in certain areas of the brain during meditation a nd prayer?\" I asked. \"Don't those demonstrate that there's a physical basis for th ese religious experience s, as opposed to an immaterial basis through the soul?\" \"No, it doesn't. All it shows is a physical correlation with religious experiences,\" he replied. \"You'll have to explain that,\" I said. \"Well, there's no question that when I'm pr aying, smelling a rose, or thinking about something, my brain still exists. It doesn't pop ou t of existence when I'm having a conscious life, including prayer. And I would be perfectly happy if scientists were to measure what was going on in my brain while I'm praying, feeling forg iveness, or even thinking about lunch. But remember: just because there is a correlation betw een two things, that doesn't mean they're the same thing. Just because there's a correlation betw een fire and smoke, this doesn't mean smoke is the same as fire. \"Now, sometimes your brain states can cause your conscious states. For example, if you lose brain functioning due to Alzheimer's disease, or you get hit over the head , you lose some of your mental conscious life. But there's also evidence that this goes the other way as well. There are data showing that your conscious life can actually reconfigure your brain. \"For example, scientists have done studies of the brains of people who worried a lot, and they found that this mental state of worry change d their brain chemistry. They've done studies of the brain patterns of little children who were not nurtured and loved, and their patterns are different than children who have warm experiences of love and nurture. So it's not just the brain that causes things to happen in our conscious life; conscious stat es can also cause things to happen to the brain. \"Consequently, I wouldn't want to say there's a physical basis for religious experiences, even though they might be correlated. Sometimes it coul d be cause-and-effect from brain to mind, but it could also be cause-and-effect from mind to brain. How do the scientists know it isn't actually my prayer life that's causing something to ha ppen in my brain, rather than the other way around?\" 56 THE RETURN OF OCKHAM'S RAZOR As we talked about the human mind, mine was drifting back to my first interview with William Lane Craig, during which he brought up a scie ntific principle called Ockham's razor. As I listened to Moreland defend the concept of dualism, it dawn ed on me that Ockham's razor would argue in the opposite direction-toward the view that only the brain exists-because it says science prefers simpler explana tions where possible. It was a challenge I decided to pose to Moreland. \"You're familiar with the scientific principle called Ockham's razor,\" I said to him. As soon as the question left my mouth, Moreland knew where I was headed. \"Yes, it says that we shouldn't multiply entities beyond what's needed to explain something. And I assume your objection is that Ockham's razor would favor a simple alternative, such as the brain accounting for everything, rather th an more complicated explana tion like the two entities of dualism.\" \"That's right,\" I said. \"Surely th is undercuts the case for dualism.\" He was ready with an answ er. \"No, it really doesn't. Ac tually, Ockham's razor favors dualism, and here's why,\" he said. \"What's the intent of Ockham's razor? The thrust of this"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"principle is that when you're trying to explain a phenomenon, you should only include the elements that are necessary to explain the phenomenon. And as I've demonstrated through scientific evidence and philosophical reasoning, dualism is necessary to explain the phenomenon of consciousness. Only dualism can account for al l of the evidence-and, henc e, it does not violate Ockham's razor.\" I wasn't ready to give up. \"But maybe we just don't have all th e evidence yet,\" I said. \"Maybe your conclusions are premature. Phys icalists are confident that the day will come when they'll be able to explain consciousness solely in physical terms.\" Moreland's reply was adamant: \"There will never, ever be a scientific explanation for mind and consciousness.\" His forceful and unequivocal statement startled me. \"Why not?\" I asked. \"Think about how scientists go about explaining things: they show that something had to happen due to antecedent conditions. For example, when scientists explain why gases behave the way they do, they show that if you hold the volume constant and increase the temperature, the pressure has to increase. That is, when we heat a pressure cooker, the pressure goes up. \"When scientists explain that, they don't just correlate temperature and pressure. They don't just say that temperature and pre ssure tend to go together. They tr y to show why the pressure has got to increase, why it couldn't have done anythi ng other than that, given the temperature increase. Scientists want to show why something has to happen given the cause; they're not content simply to correlate things and leave it at that. \"And this will never work with consciousness , because the relationship between the mind and the brain is contingent, or dependent. In other words, the mind is not something that had to happen. One atheist asked, `How could a series of physical events, little particles jostling against one another, electric currents rushing to and fro, blossom into conscious experience? Why shouldn't pain and itches be switched around? Why should any experience emerge when these neurons fire in the brain?' He's pointing out that there's no necessary connection between conscious states and the brain. \"So in the future scientists will be able to develop more correlations between conscious states and states of the brain, and that's wonderful . But my point is this: correlation is not explanation. To explain something scientifically, you've got to show why the phenomenon had to happen given the causes. And scientists cannot explain the `why' behind consciousness, because there's no necessary connection between the brai n and consciousness. It didn't have to happen this way.\" DEDUCTIONS ABOUT GOD It's no wonder that Alvin Plantinga of Notre Dame University, a dualist who is frequently called the greatest living Ameri can philosopher, surv eyed the current body/mind debate and concluded: \"Things don't look hopeful for Darwinian naturalists.\"\" Faced with data and logic that support dualism , and unable to offer a plausible theory for how consciousness could have erupted from mi ndless matter, atheists are pinning their hopes on some asyet-undetermined scientific discovery to justif y their faith in phys icalism. And some aren't even so sure about that-physicist and atheis t Steven Weinberg said scientists may have to \"bypass the problem of human consciousness\" altoge ther, because \"it may just be too hard for us.\"'s In other words, it's failing to give them the answers they want. As for Moreland, he agrees with Plantinga's bleak assessment for atheists. \"Darwinian evolution will never be able to explain the origin of consciousness,\" he told me. \"Perhaps"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Darwinists can explain how consciousness was sh aped in a certain way over time, because the behavior that consciousness caused had su rvival value. But it can't explain the origin of consciousness, because it can't explain how you can get something from nothing. \"In Darwin's notebooks, he said if there was anything his theory can't explain, then there would have to be another explan ation-a creationist expl anation. Well, he can't explain the origin of mind. He tried to reduce consciousness down to the brain, because he could tell a story about how the brain evolved. But as we've discussed, Lee, consciousness cannot be reduced merely to the physical brain. This means the atheist creation story is inadequa te and false. And yet there is an alternative explanation that makes sense of all the evidence: our consciousness came from a greater Consciousness. \"You see, the Christian worldview begins with thought and feel ing and belief and desire and choice. That is, God is conscious. God has thought s. He has beliefs, he has desires, he has awareness, he's alive, he acts with purpose. We start there. And because we start with the mind of God, we don't have a problem with explaining the origin of our mind.\" I asked, \"What, then, can we deduce about God from this?\" \"That he's rational, that he's intelligent, that he's creative, that he's sentient. And that he's invisible, because that's the way conscious beings are. I have no inclination to doubt that this very room is teeming with the presence of God, just because I can't see or touch or smell or hear him. As I explained earlier, I can't even see my own wife! I can't touch, s ee, smell, or hear the real her. \"One more thing. The existence of my soul gives me a new way to understand how God can be everywhere. That's because my soul occupies my body without being lo cated in any one part of it. There's no place in my body wh ere you can say, `Here I am.' My soul is not in the left part of my brain, it's not in my nose, it's not in my lungs. My soul is fully present everywhere throughout my body. That's why if I lose part of my body, I don't lose part of my soul. \"In a similar way, God is fully present everyw here. He isn't located, say, right outside the planet Mars. God occupies space in the same way the soul occupies the body. If space were somehow cut in half, God wouldn't lose half his being. So now I have a new model, based on my own self, for God's omnipresence. And shouldn't we expect this? If we were made in the image of God, wouldn't we expect there to be some parallels between us and God?\" I asked, \"Do you foresee more scientists coming to the conclusion that the soul, though immaterial, is very real?\" \"The answer is yes-if they are willing to open themselves up to nonscientific knowledge,\" he replied. \"I believe in science; it's wonderful a nd gives us some very important information. But there are other ways of knowing things as well. Because, remember, most of the evidence for the reality of consciousness and the soul is from our own first-person awareness of ourselves and has nothing to do with the study of th e brain. The study of the brain allo ws us to correlate the brain with conscious states, but it tells us noth ing about what consciousness itself is.\" \"But, J. P., aren't you asking scientists to do the unthinkable-to ignore scientific knowledge?\" \"No, not at all,\" he insisted. \"I'm only asking that they become willing to listen to all the evidence and see where it leads-which is wh at the quest for trut h should be about.\" \"And if they do that?\" \"They will come to believe in the reality of the soul and the immaterial nature of consciousness. And this could open them up person ally to something even more important-to a much larger Mind and a much bigger Conscious ness, who in the beginning was the Logos, and"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"who made us in his image.\" COGITO ERGO SUM A ringing telephone ended our conversation, although I was wrapping up the interview anyway. A colleague was calling to remind Moreland of a faculty meeting. I thanked Moreland for his time and insights, gathered my things, and st rolled out to my car. I was just about to start the engine, but instead I let go of the key, leaned back in my seat, and took a few moments (as Moreland would say) to introspect. Interestingly, this very act of introspection in tuitively affirmed to me what Moreland's facts and logic had already established-my ability to po nder, to reason, to specula te, to imagine, and to feel the emotional brunt of the interview showed that my mind surely could not have been the evolutionary byproduct of brute, mindless matter. \"Selfhood ... is not explicable in material or physical terms,\" said philosopher Stuart C. Hackett. \"The essential spiritual selfhood of man has its only adequate ground in the transcendent spiritual Selfhood of God as Absolute Mind.\" In other words, I am more than just the sum to tal of a physical brain a nd body parts. Rather, I am a soul, and I have a body. I thinktherefore, I am . Or as Hackett said: \"With modest apology to Descartes: Cogito, ergo Deus es t! I think, therefore God is.\" I found myself wholeheartedly agreeing with philosopher R obert Augros and physicist George Stanciu, who explored the depths of the mind/body controversy and concluded that \"physics, neuroscience, and human istic psychology all converge on the same principle: mind is not reducible to matter.\" They added: \"The vain expectation that matte r might someday account for mind ... is like the alchemist's dream of producing gold from lead. 61 I leaned forward and started the car. After mo nths of investigating scientific evidence for God-traveling a total of 26,884 miles, which is the equivalent of making one lap around the Earth at the equator I had finally reached a critical mass of information. It was time to synthesize and digest what I had learned-and ul timately to come to a conclusion that would have vast and life- changing implications.

I find it as difficult to underst and a scientist who does not acknowledge the presence of a superior rationality behind th e existence of the universe as it is to comprehend a theologian who would deny the advances of science. Werner von Braun, the father of space science Faith does not imply a close d, but an open mind. Quite the opposite of blindness, faith appreciates the vast spiritual re alities that materialists over look by getting trapped in the purely physical. Sir John Templeton Standing boldly in front of the national media, his posture like a boxer ready to pounce, the cocky prosecutor shook his fi nger at five television cameras and taunted renowned defense attorney William F. Neal. \"I defy Mr. Neal,\" he declared, \"to stop that Pinto!\" His words became a rally cry, challenging Neal to establish that a Ford Pinto containing three teenage girl s had come to a halt on an Indiana highway before being struck from behind by a Chevy van. It was yet another moment of high drama in a ground-breaking criminal trial that had captivated the nation. In the first case of its kind in U.S. history, prosec utors blamed the girls' deaths on the car's manufacturer, charging Ford Motor Company with reckless homicide for allegedly designing a vehicle that was prone to explode in low- to moderate-speed rear crashes. If the Pinto had been safe, the prosecutors co ntended, the three teenagers would have walked away virtually unscathed from the relatively minor collision. But, they said, because the car's gas tank had been located in a vulnerable position, the car erupted in a fireball that consumed them all. A pivotal issue was the severity of the cras h. Neal maintained that the Pinto had been stopped on the highway a nd the van was travelin g at fifty miles an hour. \"No subcompact could have withstood the assault of the van in this case,\" Neal told the jurors. The prosecutor, however, countered that the Pint o had been moving in the same direction as the van, which meant the force of the impact would have been much less. Indeed, a few eyewitnesses testified the car had been in moti on, though their accounts varied and during cross-"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"examination Neal sought to raise doubts about the vantage points from which they saw the Pinto. Then the prosecutor presented his star witness: the shaggy-haired, twen ty-one-year-old driver of the van, who had not been criminally charge d for the crash and was cooperating with the prosecution. He testified that the Pinto had been moving at fifteen to twenty miles an hour when they collided. Neal scoffed, pointing out that th e distracted driver had only seen the Pinto for one-sixth of a second before hitt ing it. But the driver, who had fi ve previous traffic convictions in three years, stuck to his story. In the glare of the television cameras, the prosecutor was ebullient. Feeling confident in the thoroughness of his investigation and believing Neal could offe r no contradictory testimony, he defiantly challenged Neal to make good on hi s promise that he would stop the Pinto. Surprisingly, however, the prosecutor's bravado was short-lived. A few days later, to the astonishment of the prosecution, Neal used both negative and positive evidence to accomplish what the prosecutor was convinced he could never do. First, Neal undermined the testimony of the van's driver. The physician who had treated him for minor injuries said the driver had admitted to him that the Pinto had been stopped. That was damaging enough for the prosecution. Even more devastating, Neal th en presented two surprise witn esses that police had somehow overlooked during their supposedly exhaustive investigation. Both were hospital workers who testified that the driver of the Pinto told them independently before her death that she had been stopped on U.S. Highway 133 when the van struck her car. The prosecutor was stunned. In a flash, these two unforeseen witnesses changed the entire momentum of the trial. \"Nobody knew anything about them,\" the prosecutor s puttered. \"They came out of the blue.\" Outside the courtroom, Neal was ecstatic. \"The prosecutor challenged us to stop that Pinto,\" he said, stifling a chuckle. \"Well, now we've stopped it twice.\" The once-confident prosecutor, now publicly embarrassed, found himself on the defensive as reporters pelted him with questions about why his investigation had failed to unearth these witnesses. Ultimately, after several judicial ru lings further eroded the pr osecutor's case, jurors voted to acquit the automaker. Neal's performance, which I documented in my book Reckless Homicide, was among the most masterful I had ever seen in my years as a legal affairs journalist.' His success was not the product of adroit legal maneuvering, clever argume nts, or courtroom slight-of-hand. Plain and simple, it was old-fashioned, dog ged detective work that uncove red the surprise witnesses. Defense investigators went beyond the obvious, posed questions that others weren't asking, out- hustled police investigators, and foll owed the clues wherever they led. Years later, I would und erstand exactly how the prosecutor felt that day. I was once full of confidence that Darwinism justified my atheism. I felt I had investigated the issue sufficiently, having studied biology, chemistry, geology, anth ropology, and other sciences in school and having read books that reenforced my beliefs . No doubt about it-natural selection acting on random variation had put God out of a job. When Christians approached me about the evid ence for their faith, I wa s as defiant as the combative prosecutor on the courthouse steps. The Origin of Species trumped the Bible. The critical thinking of scientists overpowered the wi shful thinking of theists. To me, the case was closed. But then, prompted by the positive changes in my wife after she became a follower of Jesus, I began to go beyond the obvious, to set aside my prejudices, to ask questions I had never posed"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"before, and to pursue the clues of science and history wherever they led. Instead of letting naturalism limit my search, I opene d myself to the full range of possibilities. And, frankly, I wasn't prepared for what would happen. Like the negative evidence that undermined the van's driver in the Pinto case, the facts of science systematically eroded the foundation of Darwinism until it could no longer support the weight of my atheistic conclusions. Suddenly, the intellectual basis fo r my skepticism was collapsing. That was disconcerting enough. But then-like th e surprise witnesses who suddenly shifted the momentum at the Indiana trial-my wide -ranging research was bu ilding an unexpected affirmative case for the existence of a Creator. Yes, I was stunned; yes, I felt like the wind was being knocked out of me; yes, it was unnerving to wrestle with the implications. But I had vowed to follow the facts regardless of the cost-even at the cost of my own smug self-sufficiency. A FRESH EXAMINATION OF THE EVIDENCE I was reminded of the Pinto trial as I sat in my home office a nd glanced over at a shelf where my eye caught the book I had written on the case. As I started reminiscing about the unanticipated turnaround in that courtroom drama, my thoughts drifte d to the emotions I felt on November 8, 1981. It was on that day, after nearly two years of intensive researc h, that I sat alone in my room and wrote down the key evidence I had discovered during my original investigation into the credibility of Christianity. Much of it concerned the facts regarding the life, teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, as I described in my book The Case for Christ, and the answers to the \"Big Ei ght\" objections to Christia nity, as I recounted in The Case for Faith. But also very important at the time were the corroborating scientific facts. Even though there was less evidence than is readily available toda y, there was still plenty upon which to reach a verdict. I can remember analyzing the scientific research and coming to the startling conclusion that the data of the physical world point powerfully toward the existence of a Creator. What seemed impossible two years earlier now s eemed not just possible, not just likely-but obvious. Like the Pinto prosecutor, I was dismayed and disoriented-and ye t at the same time I felt confident and even strangely comforted by the conclusion. Now, more than two decades later, having spent over a year reev aluating and updating the case for a Creator by interviewing experts On the la test scientific discoveries, I sat at my desk once more and mentally reviewed the mo st current evidence I had encountered. I was amazed at how new findings in physics, astronomy, biochemistry, and other disciplines have added so much to the pool of scientific kn owledge. As I considered the evidence afresh, I tried to honestly weigh which hypothesis-Darwin ism or Design-best accounted for the most current data of science. POSSIBILITY #1: THE DARWINISM HYPOTHESIS To start with, I considered how the facts fit the hypot hesis that all of life can be explained by the undirected, purely natu ralistic processes of e volution. \"Like all othe r scientific theories, Darwinian evolution must be con tinually compared with the evid ence,\" said biologist Jonathan Wells. \"If it does not fit the evidence, it must be reevaluated or abandone d-otherwise it is not science, but myth.\" 4 Looking at the doctrine of Darwinism, which un dergirded my atheism for so many years, it"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"didn't take me long to conclude that it was simply too far-fetched to be credible. I re alized that if I were to embrace Darwinism and its underlying pr emise of naturalism, I would have to believe that: • Nothing produces everything • Non-life produces life • Randomness produces fine-tuning • Chaos produces information • Unconsciousness produces consciousness • Non-reason produces reason Based on this, I was forced to conclude that Darwinism would require a blind leap of faith that I was not willing to make. Simply put, the central pillars of evolutionary theory quickly rotted away when exposed to scrutiny. For example, naturalistic pro cesses have utterly failed to explain how non-living chemicals could somehow self-assemble into the first living cell. Not only are there no viable theories, but none are on the horizon. Biochemist Klaus Dose, one of the leading origin-of-life experts, conceded: \"At present all discussi ons on principle theories and e xperiments in the field either end in stalemate or in a confession of ignorance.\" 5 Science writer Robert Roy Britt cast the problem more colorfully: \"Have you ever had one of those dreams where you try to run from a monster and your le gs go round and round but you don't get anywhere? The quest to understand the origin of li fe isn't much different.\" Stephen C. Meyer pointed out in my interview that there are insurmountable hurdles involving the origin of biological information that simply ca nnot be resolved by more research and effort. In other words, origin-of-life scientists are not going to wake up from their nightmare. To me, this constitutes the Achilles' heel of e volutionary theory. As bi ochemist Michael Denton observed, the idea that undirected processes could somehow turn dead chemicals into all the extraordinary complexity of livi ng things is surely \"no more nor less than the great cosmogenic myth\" of our times.? In addition, the overall fossil r ecord has stubbornly refused to confirm the grand claims of Darwinian transitions. Despite innumerable discove ries since Darwin's day, \"the intermediates have remained as elusive as ever,\" said Denton. 8 Rather than harmonize into a consistent case for Darwin's theory, the fossils are a discordant cacophony that cannot reasonably account for the monumental leaps Darwinism mu st make, for example, between fish and amphibians or amphibians and reptiles. The most glaring deficiency of the fossil record is biology's Big Bang, the Cambrian explosion. The majority-or, according to some expe rts, all-of the world's forty phyla, the highest category in the animal kingdom, vi rtually sprang forth with unique body plans more than five hundred million years ago. The sudden appearance of these radically new life forms, devoid of prior transitions, has turned Darw in's Tree of Life on its head. Like the overconfident prosecuto r in the Pinto case, Darwin predicted that new discoveries would explain away this quantum leap in biologi cal complexity. In reality, they have only made matters worse. The excuse that the transitionary cr eatures were too soft or small to be fossilized withers under examination. A lternate theories, like Stephe n Jay Gould's \"punctuated equilibrium,\" dash themselves on the rocks of re ason. Darwin's assessment is still accurate more than a century and a ha lf later: the Cambrian explosion is \"inexplicable\" under his hypothesis. This remains, in my opinion, a fatal shortcoming."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"When I examined these and other deficiencies of Darwinism as objectively as I could, I became firmly convinced that evolution is a confirmed fact-as long as it's defined as the micro- evolutionary variations we see in the animal and plant world. Undeniably, a considerable amount of change and diversification ha s taken place over time. However, there is simply insufficient evidence from which to draw the radical conclusion that large-scale, macro-evolutionary transitions have occurred. As award-winning author Roger Lewin, a former editor with Science and New Scientist magazines, summarized a historic scientific conference on macroevolution: \"The central question ... was whether the mechanisms underlying microevolution can be extrapol ated to explain the phenomenon of macroevolution. At the risk of doing violence to the position of some people at the meeting, the answer can be given as a clear, No.\" 9 In short, the amount of faith n eeded to maintain belief in the most sweeping and controversial claims of Darwinism far exceeded what I believed was reasonably warranted by the hard evidence of science. On top of that, naturalism has absolutely no credible explanation for how the universe came into being in the first place. This failure of the naturalistic and Darwinist ideas opened the door to considering the other hypothesis-that both the universe and the life it contains are the product of an intelligent designer. POSSIBILITY #2: THE DESIGN HYPOTHESIS \"A big, fundamental question, li ke belief in God (or disbelief) , is not settled by a single argument,\" said physicist-turned-t heologian John Polkinghorne. \"I t's too complicated for that. What one has to do is to consider lots of differe nt issues and see whether or not the answers one gets add up to a total picture that makes sense.\" 10 That's the approach I took in my investigation. I probed six different scientific disciplines to see whether they point toward or away from the existence of an intelligent designer. When I opened my mind to the possibility of an explanation beyond naturalism, I found that the design hypothesis most clearly accounted for the evidence of science. The \"explanatory power\" of the design hypothesis outstripped every other theory. Cons ider some of the facts that were adduced in my investigation: • The Evidence of Cosmology Thanks to scientific discoveries of the last fifty years, the ancient kalam cosmological argument has taken on a powerful and persuasive new force. As described by William Lane Craig, the argument is simple yet elegant: first, whatever begins to exist has a cause. Even renowned skeptic David Hume didn't deny this firs t premise. In fact, atheist Quentin Smith's contention that \"we came from nothing, b y nothing, and for nothing\" seems intuitively absurd. Second, the universe had a beginning. Based on the data, virtua lly all cosmologists now agree the universe began in the Big Bang at some specific point in the past . Craig stressed that even alternate theories for the origin of the universe require a beginning. For instance, Stephen Hawking's use of \"imaginary numbers\" merely conceals the beginning point in his own model, which Hawking admits is not re ally a description of reality. The conclusion then follows inexorably from the two premises: therefore, the universe has a cause. Even once-agnostic astronomer Robert Jast row conceded the essential elements of Christianity and modern cosmology are the sa me: \"The chain of events leading to man commenced suddenly and sharply, at a definite mome nt in time, in a flash of light and energy.\" "},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"• The Evidence of Physics One of the most striking discove ries of modern science has been that the laws and constants of physics unexpectedly conspire in an extraordinary way to make the universe habitable for life. For instance, said physicist-philosopher Robin Collins, gravity is finetuned to one part in a hundred million billion billi on billion billion billion. The cosmological constant, which represents the energy density of space, is as precise as throwing a dart from space and hit ting a bulls-eye just a trillionth of a trillionth of an inch in diameter on Earth. One expert said there are more than thirty physical or cosmological parameters that require precise calibration in or der to produce a universe that can sustain life. Collins demonstrated that chance cannot reasonabl y account for this \"anthropic principle\" and that the most-discussed alternativethat there are multiple universes-lacks any evidential support and ultimately collapses upon the realization that these other worlds would owe their existence to a highly designed process. This evidence was so powerful that it was in strumental in Patrick Glynn abandoning his atheism. \"Today the concrete data point strongly in the direction of the God hypothesis,\" he said. \"It is the simplest and most obvious solution to the anthropic puzzle.\" • The Evidence of Astronomy Similar to the fine-tuning of physics, Earth' s position in the universe and its intricately choreographed geological and chemical processes work together with exquisite efficiency to create a safe place for humans to live. For example, astronomer Guillermo Gonzalez an d science philosopher Jay Wesley Richards said it would take a star with the highly unusual propert ies of our sun-the right mass, the right light, the right age, the right di stance, the right orbit, the right galaxy, the right location-to nurture living organisms on a circ ling planet. Numerous factors make our solar system and our location in the universe just righ t for a habitable environment. What's more, the exceptional conditions that make life possible also happen to make our planet strangely well-suited for viewing and analyzing the universe and our environment. All of this suggests our planet may be ra re, if not unique, and that the Cr eator wanted us to be able to explore the cosmos. \"If the universe had not been made with the most exacting precision we could never have come into existence,\" said Harvard-educated as trophysicist John A. O'Keef e of NASA. \"It is my view that these circumstances indicate the universe was created for man to live in.\" • The Evidence of Biochemistry Darwin said, \"If it could be demonstrated th at any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successi ve, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.\" Biochemist Michael Be he has demonstrated exactly that through his description of \"irre ducibly complex\" molecular machines. These complicated, microscopic contraptions, such as cilia and ba cterial flagella, are extremely unlikely to have been built piece-bypiece through Darwinian processes, because they had to be fully present in order to function. Other examples include the incredible system of transporting proteins within cells and the intricate process of bloodclotting. More than just a devastating challenge to Darwinism, these amazing biological systems- which far exceed the capacity of human technol ogy-point toward a tran scendent Creator. \"My conclusion,\" said Behe, \"can be summed up in a single word: design. I say that based on science."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"I believe that irreducibly complex systems are strong evidence of a purposeful, intentional design by an intelligent agent.\" Behe's argument has proven impervious to ch allenges by skeptics. While obviously there will be future discoveries in biochemistry, Belie poi nted out that they will not be able to negate the complexity that has already been discovere d-and which is best explained by a Creator. • The Evidence of Biological Information The six-feet of DNA coiled inside every one of our body's one hundred tr illion cells contains a four-letter chemical alphabet that spells out precise assembly in structions for all the proteins from which our bodies are made. Cambridge-edu cated Stephen Meyer demonstrated that no hypothesis has come close to explaining how information got into biological matter by naturalistic means. On the contrary, he said that whenever we find a sequential arrangement that's complex and corresponds to an independent pattern or function, this kind of information is always the product of intelligence. \"Books, computer codes, and DN A all have these two properties,\" he said. \"We know books and computer codes are designed by intel ligence, and the presence of this type of information in DNA also implies an intelligent source.\" In addition, Meyer said the Cambrian explos ion's dazzling array of new life forms, which suddenly appeared fully formed in the fossil record, with no prior transitions, would have required the infusion of massive amounts of ne w biological information. \"Information is the hallmark of mind,\" said Meyer. \"And purely from the evidence of genetics and biology, we can infer the existence of a mind that's far greater than our own-a conscious, purposeful, rational, intelligent designer who's amazingly creative.\" • The Evidence of Consciousness Many scientists are concluding that the laws of chemistry and phys ics cannot explain our experience of consciousness. Professor J. P. Moreland defined consciousness as our introspection, sensations, thoughts, emotions, desires, beliefs, and free choices that make us alive and aware. The \"soul\" contains our consciousness and animates our body. According to a researcher who showed that co nsciousness can continue after a person's brain has stopped functioning, current scientific fi ndings \"would support th e view that `mind,' `consciousness,' or the `soul' is a separate entity from the brain.\" As Moreland said, \"You can't get something fro m nothing.\" If th e universe began with dead matter having no conscious, \"how, then, do you get something to tally different-consciousness, living, thinking, feeling, believing creatures-from materials that don't have that?\" But if everything started with the mind of God, he sai d, \"we don't have a problem with explaining the origin of our mind.\" Darwinist philosopher Michael Ruse candidly conceded that \"no one, certainly not the Darwinian as such, seems to have any answer\" to the consciousness issu e. Nobel Prize-winning neurophysiologist John C. Eccles co ncluded from the evidence \"that there is what we might call a supernatural origin of my unique self-c onscious mind or my unique selfhood or soul.\" THE IDENTITY OF THE DESIGNER As I reviewed the avalanche of information fr om my investigation, I found the evidence for an intelligent designer to be credible, coge nt, and compelling. Actua lly, in my opinion the combination of the findings from cosmology and physics by themselves were sufficient to sup- port the design hypothesis. All of the other data simply built an even more powerful cumulative"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"case that ended up overwhelming my objections. But who or what is this master Designer? Like playing a game of connect-the-dots, each one of the six scientific disciplines I investigated contributed clues to unmasking the identity of the Creator. As Craig explained during our interview, the evidence of cosmology demonstrates that the cause of the universe must be an uncaused, begi nningless, timeless, immaterial, personal being endowed with freedom of will and enormous powe r. In the area of physics, Collins established that the Creator is intelligent and has continue d to be involved with his creation after the Big Bang. The evidence of astronomy, showing that the Cr eator was incredibly precise in creating a livable habitat for the creatures he designed, logically implies that he has care and concern for them. Also, Gonzalez and Richards presented evid ence that the Creator has built at least one purpose into his creatures-to explore the worl d he has designed, and therefore to perhaps discover him through it. Not only do biochemistry and the existence of biological information affirm the Creator's activity after the Big Bang, but they also show he's incred ibly creative. Evidence for consciousness, as Moreland said, helps establish that the Creator is rational, gives us a basis for understanding his omnipresence, and even sugg ests that life after death is credible. This is not a picture of the god of deism, who supposedly formed the universe but then abandoned it. As Meyer explained in my first interview with him, the abundant evidence for the Creator's continued activity in the universe after the initial creation event discredits deism as a credible possibility. Pantheism, the idea that the Creator and unive rse are co-existent, also falls short of accounting for the evidence, because it cannot expl ain how the universe came into existence. After all, if the pantheistic god didn't exist prior to the physical universe, then it would not be capable of bringing the universe into being. Also, Craig explained how the scientific pr inciple of Ockham's razor shaves away the multiple gods of polytheism, leaving us with a single Creator. In addition, the personal nature of the Creator argues against the impersonal divine force that's at the center of some New Age religions. In contrast, however, the portrai t of the Creator that emerges from the scientific data is uncannily consistent with the description of the God whose identity is spe lled out in the pages of the Bible. • Creator? \"In the beginning you laid the foundations of the eart h, and the heavens are the work of your hands.\"\" • Unique? \"You were shown these things so that you might know that the Lord is God; besides him there is no other.\" 12 • Uncaused and timeless? \"Before the mountains were bor n or you brought forth the earth and the world, from everlasti ng to everlasting you are God. \" • Immaterial? \"God is spirit.\" 14 • Personal? \"I am God Almighty. \"15 • Freedom of will? \"And God said, `Let there be light,' and there was light.\" 16 • Intelligent and rational? \"How many are your works, 0 Lo rd! In wisdom you made them all; the earth is full of your creatures.\" 1 ' • Enormously powerful? \"The Lord is ... great in power.\" Creative? \"For you created my inmost being; you kn it me together in my mother's womb. I"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well. • Caring? \"The earth is full of his unfailing love.” • Omnipresent? \"The heavens, even the highest heaven, cannot contain you.\" 27 • Has given humankind purpose? \"For everything, absolutely everything, above and below, visible and invisible.... everything got starte d in him and finds its purpose in him.\" 22 • Provides for life after death? \"He will swallow up death forever.\" 23 As the apostle Paul wrote two millennia ago: \"For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities-his eternal power and divine nature-have b een clearly seen, being understood from what has been made [that is, his creation], so that men are without excuse.\" 24 The question of whether these qua lities might also describe th e deities of any other world religions became moot once I added the evidence that I discovered through the study of ancient history and archaeology. As I described in my book The Case for Christ-a summary of which is included as an appendix to this book-the convinc ing evidence establishes the es sential reliability of the New Testament, demonstrates the fulfillment of anci ent prophecies in the life of Jesus of Nazareth against all odds, and suppor ts Jesus' resurrection as being an actual event that occurred in time and space. Indeed, his return from the dead is an unprecedented and supernatural feat that authenticated his claim to bei ng the one-and-only Son of God. To me, the range, the variety, the depth, and the breathtaking persuasive power of the evidence from both science and history affirmed the credibility of Christianity to the degree that my doubts were simply washed away. Unlike Darwinism, where my faith would have to swim upstream against the strong current of evidence flowing the other way, putting my trust in the God of the Bible was nothing less than the most rational and natural decision I could make. I was merely permitting the torrent of facts to carry me along to their most logical conclusion. THE FUSION OF SCIENCE AND FAITH Unfortunately, there's a lot of misunderstand ing about faith. Some believe faith actually contradicts facts. \"The whole point of fa ith,\" scoffed Michael Shermer, editor of The Skeptical Inquirer, \"is to believ e regardless of the evidence, which is the very antithesis of science.\" However, that's certainly not my understanding. I see faith as being a reasonable step in the same direction that the evid ence is pointing. In other wo rds, faith goes beyond merely acknowledging that the facts of sc ience and history point toward God. It's responding to those facts by investing trust in God-a step that's fully warranted due to the supporting evidence. Oxford's Alister McGrath pointed out that all worldviews require faith. \"The truth claims of atheism simply cannot be proved,\" he said. \"How do we know that there is no God? The simple fact of the matter is that atheism is a faith, which draws conclusions that go beyond the available evidence.\" 26 On the other hand, the available evidence from the latest scientific research is convincing more and more scientists that f acts support faith as never before. \"T he age-old notion that there is more to existence than meets the eye suddenly looks like fresh thinking again,\" said journalist Gregg Easterbrook. \"We are ente ring the greatest era of scie nce-religion fusion since the Enlightenment last attempted to reconcile the two.\" 27 To many people, including physicist Paul Da vies, this is a shocking and unexpected"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"development. \"It may seem bizarre,\" he said, \"but in my opinion science offers a surer path to God than religion.\" 28 Added nanoscientist James Tour of Rice University: \"Only a rookie who knows nothing about science would say sc ience takes away from faith. If you re ally study science, it will bring you closer to God .” Astrophysicist and priest George Coyne put it this way: \"Nothing we learn about the universe threatens our faith. It only enriches it.\" 30 For Polkinghorne, who achieved acclaim as a ma thematical physicist at Cambridge before becoming a full-time minister, the same kind of th inking he uses in science has helped him draw life-changing conclusions about God: No one has ever seen a quark, and we believe that no one ever will. They are so tightly bound to each other inside the protons and neutrons that nothing can make them break out on their own. Why, then, do I believe in these invisible quarks? ... In summary, it's because quarks make sense of a lot of direct physical evidence.... I wish to engage in a similar strategy with regard to the unseen re ality of God. His exis tence makes sense of many aspects of our knowledge and experience: the order and fruitful ness of the physical world; the multilayered character of reality; the almost universal human experiences of worship and hope; the phenomenon of Jesus Christ (including his re surrection). I think that very similar thought processes are involved in both cases. I do not believe that I shift in some strange intellectual way when I move from science to religi on.... In their search for truth, science and faith are in tellectual cousins under the skin. \"31 He added, however, an important distinction. \"Religious knowledge is more demanding than scientific knowledge,\" he said. \"W hile it requires scrupulous atten tion to matters of truth, it also calls for the response of commit ment to the truth discovered.\" 32 According to McGrath, the Hebrew word for \"tru th\" suggests \"something which can be relied upon.\" Thus, he said, truth is more than about simply being right. \"It is about trustworthiness,\" he explained. \"It is a relational concept, pointing us to someone who is totally worthy of our trust. We are not being asked to know yet another fact but to enter into a relationship with the one who is able to sustain and comfort us.\" 33 The facts of science and history, then, can only take us so far. At some point, the truth demands a response. When we decide not merely to ponder the abstract co ncept of a designer but to embrace him as our own-to make him our \"tru e God\"-then we can meet him personally, relate to him daily, and spend eternity with him as he promises. And that, as a young medical doctor and his wife learned, changes everything. FROM SCIENCE TO GOD No one was more surprised by the scientific evidence for God than the soft-spoken, silver- haired, seventy-seven-year-old physician who was sitting across from me in a booth at a Southern California restaurant. His story, like the one Craig told me earlier about the Easter n European physic ist who found God through cosmology, is yet another testimony to the power of science to point seekers toward God. However, it's something else too-a road map for how you might want to proceed if you're personally interested in s eeing whether faith in God is warranted by the facts. Viggo Olsen is a brilliant surgeon whose life was steeped in science. Graduating cum laude from medical school, he later became a diplomat e of the American Board of Surgery and a fellow of the American College of Surgeons. In fact , his name has a whole raft of letters after it-"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"M.S., M.D., Litt.D., D.H., F.A.C.S., F.I.C.S., and D.T M.&H. He attributes his former spiritual skepticism to his knowledge of the scientific world. \"I viewed Christianity and th e Bible through agnostic eyes,\" he said. \"My wife Joan was a skeptic too. We believed there was no independent proof that any Creator exists. Rather, we believed life came into being thr ough evolutionary processes.\" The problem was Joan's parents, both devout Ch ristians. When Viggo and Joan visited them in 1951 on their way to starting his first internship at a New York City hospital, they got an earful of religious propaganda . In late-night discussions, Viggo and Joan would patiently explain why Christianity was inconsistent with contemporary science. Finally, in frustration at two o'clock one morning around the kitchen table, th ey agreed to examine the Christian faith for themselves. Olsen implied his search would be sincere and honest , but inwardly he had already hatched a plan. \"My intent was not to do an objective study at all,\" he recalled. \"Just like a surgeon incises a chest, we were going to slash into the Bible and dissect out all its embarrassing scientific mistakes.\" At their new home, Viggo and Joan labeled a pi ece of paper: \"Scientific Mistakes in the Bible,\" figuring they co uld easily fill it. They worked out a system under which they would discuss with each other what they were learning in their investigation. At the end, there would always be more unanswered que stions. While Viggo was working at the hospital, Joan would research the issues left ha nging. Then, on alternate nights a nd weekends, when Viggo was off duty, they studied together, an alyzed, discussed, and argued. Problems quickly emerged-but no t the kind they were anticipating. \"We we re having trouble finding those scientific mistakes,\" he said. \"We'd find something that seemed to be an error, but on further reflection and study, we saw that our understa nding had been shallow. That made us sit up and take notice.\" Then a student passed along a 1948 book called Modern Science and Christian Faith. 34 Each of its thirteen chapters was written by a different scientist about the evidence in his field that pointed toward God. Even though it was publishe d before many of the eye-popping scientific discoveries that I've describe d in this book, the evidence was ne vertheless sufficient to stun Viggo and Joan. \"It blew our minds!\" Olsen said. \"For the fi rst time we began to see there were reasons behind Christianity. Deciding to believe would definitely not be committing intellectual suicide.\" THE ADVENTURE OF A LIFETIME They devoured that book, plus many others that were cited in its bibliography. As they analyzed the evidence, they came to several conclusions. First, they knew on scientific grounds that the un iverse was not eternal. Rather, it came into being at a certain point. Since the universe is pa cked with power-heat energy, atomic energy, and so forth-they reasoned that it must have b een brought into being by some mighty force. Second, they looked at the obvious design of the universe and the human body, all the way down to organs and cells, conclu ding that the power that brought the universe into existence must also be intelligent. Third, they decided that as grea t as the human intellect is, ther e is something even higher-the ability of people to empathize, to love, and to have compa ssion. Since the Creator must be greater than his creatures, he must also be imbued with those same qualities."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Based on evidence and reasoning inde pendent of the Bible, they we re able to answer the first of the three questions that formed the basis of their invest igation: \"Is there a God who created the universe?\" They surprised themselves with their verdict: yes, a personal Creator-God does exist. With this established, they be gan exploring their next two br oad questions: \"Did God reveal himself to humankind through the Bible or other sacred scriptures ? And is Jesus the Son of God- deity united with humanity-and can he help us as he claimed?\" The investigation continued into those topi cs. One day, while Viggo was working at the hospital, he formulated what he thought was a powerful argument against Christianity. \"I was really proud of it,\" he told me, reliving the scen e as if it were last month. \"I spent all day mentally honing it. I couldn't wait to tell Joan!\" At the end of his shift, he wa lked the three blocks to their small apartment. \"To this day I remember the thought that struck me as Jo an opened the door and gave me a kiss-what a neat little pregnant wife I've got.\" He walked in and closed the door. Standing in the entryway, he explained his new objection to Christianity. Finally, he asked, \"What do you think?\" \"There was silence for a moment,\" he reca lled. \"Then Joan looked up at me with her beautiful blue eyes and said, `But , Vic, haven't you, after all our st udies, really come to believe Christ is the Son of God?' \"There was something about the way she said it and the way she looked at me that almost instantaneously knocked down all th e barriers remaining in my mind,\" he said. \"The evidence was no longer obstructed. All we had learned cam e together into a wonderful, magnificent, glowing, fabulous picture of Jesus. \"I hesitated, and then I said, `Yes, I really do. I know it's true. I do believe!' I hadn't believed up until that point-but with the barriers torn down, I knew she was right. We moved into the living room and sat down on the couc h. I said, `So what about you?' \"She said, \"I settled the matter se veral days ago, but I was afraid to tell you. All the things we studied and learned finally convinced me about the Bible, about Christ, and about my need-our need-for him. A few days ago, I knew I was comp letely convinced.' She had already prayed to receive God's gift of forgiveness and eternal life . And that started the bi ggest adventure of our lives!\" Wanting to maximize the impact they would have, Viggo and Joan prayed a bold prayer in which they asked God to send them to a place de void of both Christians and medical care. He obliged-and they ended up spending thirty-t hree years in the poverty-wracked nation of Bangladesh. There, they founded Memorial Christian Hospita l as a center of medical care and spiritual light, where countless people have found healing and hope. They and their colleagues helped establish 120 churches. They were warmly embraced by the people and the government of Bangladesh-in fact, Viggo was honored with Visa #001 in gratitude for hi s contributions to the country. \"It must have been difficult to live in an underdeveloped nation like that,\" I said. \"Actually,\" he told me with a smile, \"it was th e greatest adventure we could ever have. When you're in a hard place, when you're over your head again and again, when you're sinking and beyond yourself and praying your heart out-then you see God reach out, and touch your life, and resolve the situation beyond anythi ng you could have ever hoped.\" His eyes sparkled. \"That's living it up!\" he d eclared. \"There's nothing th at can match that. We got to experience that again and again and agai n. We wouldn't have missed it for the world. In"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"my opinion, finding the purpose for which God made you-whatever it may beand then fully pursuing it is simply the very best way to live.\" Viggo eventually wrote three books about his experiences. I especia lly like the title of one of them-The Agnostic Who Dared to Search ; \"- because it suggests there is a risk involved with investigating the evidence for God. At some point, the truth you uncover is going to demand a response. And that could change everything. YOU WERE DESIGNED FOR DISCOVERY Though Viggo Olsen has a stronger science background than I do, there were definite similarities in the way we both approached the issue of faith and science. We read hooks, we asked questions, we tracked down leads, and we pursued the evidence regardless of where it was taking us. We investigated systematically and en thusiastically, as if our lives depended on it. And in the end, our lives, our attitudes, our philosophies, our worldview s, our priorities, and our relationships were re volutionizedfor the better. If you're a spiritual skeptic or seeker, I hope you'll resolve to investigate the evidence for yourself. Actually, Olsen's three-pronged appr oach would provide a good outline to follow: • First, is there a God w ho created the universe? • Second, did God reveal himself to humanki nd through the Bible or other sacred scriptures? • Third, is Jesus the Son of God-deity united with humanity and can he help us as he claimed? You'll soon find that the universe is governed by both physical laws and spiritual laws. The physical laws point us toward the Creator; th e spiritual laws tell us how we can know him personally, both today and forever. After all, he's not just the Creator in a broad sense; he's your creator. You were made to relate to him in a vibrant, dynamic, and intimat e way. And if you seek him wholeheartedly, he promises to provide all the clues you need to find him. 36 In fact, you may even have sensed as you've been reading this book that he's alrea dy pursuing you in a subtle but very real way. You were, as the research by Gonzalez and Ri chards suggests, designed for discovery-and the greatest discovery of your life awaits you. So I hope you'll pursue scientific knowledge, but that you won't stop there. Don't let its allure beco me a destination; instea d, allow it to guide you beyond itself to the incredible implicati ons it offers for your life and eternity. My suggestion is this: take a few quiet moments to soak in these closing words, so eloquently expressed by Alister McGrath, and them become an impetus toward your adventure of a lifetime: Many have found that the awesome sight of th e star-studded heavens evoke a sense of wonder, an awareness of transcendence, that is charged with spiritual significance. Yet the distant shimmering of stars does not itself crea te this sense of longing; it merely exposes what is already there. They are catalysts for our spiritual insights, revealing our emptiness and compelling us to ask whether and how this void might be filled. Might our true origins and destiny somehow lie beyond those stars? Might there not be a homeland, from which we are presently exiled and to which we secretly long to return? Might not our accumulation of discontentmen t and disillusionment with our present existence be a pointer to another land where our true destiny lies and which is able to make its presence felt now in this haunting way?"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Suppose that this is not where we are meant to be but that a better land is at hand? We don't belong here. We have somehow lost ou r way. Would not this make our present existence both strange and splendid? Strange, be cause it is not where our true destiny lies; splendid, because it points ahead to where that real hope might be found. The beauty of the night skies or a glorious suns et are important pointers to the origins and the ultimate fulfillment of our heart's deep est desires. But if we mistake the signpost for what is signposted, we will attach our hopes and longings to lesser goals, which cannot finally quench our thirst for meaning. 37"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":" APPENDIX: A SUMMARY OF THE CASE FOR CHRIST Here is a summary of the historical evidence fo r Jesus Christ from thirteen leading experts who were interviewed for my book The Case for Christ: CAN THE BIOGRAPHIES OF JESUS BE TRUSTED? I once thought that the gospels were merely religious propaganda, hopelessly tainted by overactive imaginations and evangelistic zeal. But Craig Blomberg of Denver Seminary, one of the country's foremost authorities on the biographies of Jesus, built a convincing case that they reflect eyewitness testimony and bear the unmistaka ble earmarks of accuracy. So early are these accounts of Jesus' life that they cannot be explained away as le gendary inventions. \"Within the first two years after his death,\" Blomberg said, \"s ignificant numbers of Jesus' followers seem to have formulated a doctrine of the atonement, were convinced that he had been raised from the dead in bodily form, associated Jesus with God, and believed they found support for all these convictions in the Old Testam ent.\" A study indicates that th ere was nowhere enough time for legend to have developed and wiped out a solid core of historical truth. DO JESUS' BIOGRAPHIES STAND UP TO SCRUTINY? Blomberg argued persuasively that the gospel writ ers intended to preser ve reliable history, were able to do so, were honest and willing to include difficult-to-explain material, and didn't allow bias to unduly color their reporting. The harmony among the gospels on essential facts, coupled with divergence on some incidental detail s, lends historical credibility to the accounts. What's more, the early church could not have taken root and flourished ri ght there in Jerusalem if it had been teaching facts a bout Jesus that his own contempor aries could have exposed as exaggerated or false. In shor t, the gospels were able to pass all eight evidential tests, demonstrating their basic trustwor thiness as historical records. WERE JESUS' BIOGRAPHIES RELIABLY PRESERVED FOR US? World-class scholar Bruce Metz ger, professor emeritus at Pr inceton Theological Seminary, said that compared to other ancient documents, there is an unprecedented number of New Testament manuscripts and that they can be dated extremely close to the original writings. The modern New Testament is 99.5 percent free of te xtual discrepancies, with no major Christian doctrine in doubt. The criteria used by the early c hurch to determine which books should be considered authoritative have ensured that we possess the best records about Jesus."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"IS THERE CREDI BLE EVIDENCE FOR JESUS OUTSIDE HIS BIOGRAPHIES? \"We have better historical documentation for Je sus than for the founder of any other ancient religion,\" said Edwin Yamauchi of Miami Univ ersity, a leading expert on ancient history. Sources from outside the Bible corroborate that many people believed Jesus performed healings and was the Messiah, that he was crucified, and th at despite this shameful death, his followers, who believed he was still alive, worshiped him as God. One expert documented thirty-nine ancient sources that corroborate more than one hundred facts concerning Jesus' life, teachings, crucifixion, and resurrec tion. Seven secular sources and seve ral early Christian creeds concern the deity of Jesus, a doctrine \"definitely pres ent in the earliest church,\" according to Gary Habermas, the scholar who wrote The Historical Jesus. DOES ARCHAEOLOGY CONFIRM OR CONTRADICT JESUS' BIOGRAPHIES? John McRay, a professor of archaeology for mo re than fifteen years and author of Archaeology and the New Testament, said there's no question that archaeo logical findings have enhanced the New Testament's credibility. No discovery has ever disproved a biblical reference. Further, archaeology has establis hed that Luke, who wrote about one- quarter of the New Testament, was an especially careful historian. Concluded one e xpert: \"If Luke was so painstakingly accurate in his historical reporting [of mi nor details], on what logical basis may we assume he was credulous or inaccurate in his reporting of matters that were far more important, not only to him but to others as well?\" Like, for instance, the resurrection of Jesus-the event that authenticated hi s claim to being the unique Son of God. IS THE JESUS OF HISTORY THE SAME AS THE JESUS OF FAITH? Gregory Boyd, a Yale- and Princeton-educated scholar who wrote the award-winning Cynic Sage or Son of God, offered a devastating critique of the Jesus Seminar, a group that questions whether Jesus said or did most of what's attributed to him. He identified the Seminar as \"an extremely small number of radical-fringe schol ars who are on the far, far left wing of New Testament thinking.\" The Seminar ruled out the po ssibility of miracles at the outset, employed questionable criteria, and some participants have touted myth-riddled documents of extremely dubious quality. Further, the idea that stories about Jesus emerged from mythology fails to withstand scrutiny. Said Boyd: \"The evidence for Je sus being who the disciples said he was ... is just light years beyond my reas ons for thinking that the left-w ing scholarship of the Jesus Seminar is correct.\" In sum, the Jesus of faith is the same as the Jesus of history. WAS JESUS REALLY CONVINCED HE WAS THE SON OF GOD? By going back to the very earliest traditions, which were safe from legendary development, Ben Witherington III, author of The Christology of Jesus, was able to show that Jesus had a supreme and transcendent self- understanding. Based on the eviden ce, Witherington said: \"Did Jesus believe he was the Son of God, the anointed one of God? The answer is yes. Did he see himself as the Son of Man? The answer is yes. Did he see himself as the final Messiah? Yes, that's the way he viewed himself. Did he be lieve that anybody less th an God could save the"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"world? No, I don't believe he did.\" Scholars said th at Jesus' repeated reference to himself as the Son of Man was not a claim of humanity, but a re ference to Daniel 7:13-14, in which the Son of Man is seen as having universal authority and everlasting dominion and who receives the worship of all nations. Said one scholar: \"Thus, the claim to be the Son of Man would be in effect a claim to divinity.\" WAS JESUS CRAZY WHEN HE CLAIMED TO BE THE SON OF GOD? Gary Collins, a professor of psychology for twen ty years and author of forty-five books on psychology-related topics, said Je sus exhibited no inappropriate emotions, was in contact with reality, was brilliant and had amazing insights in to human nature, and enjoyed deep and abiding relationships. \"I just don't see signs that Jesu s was suffering from any known mental illness,\" he concluded. In addition, Jesus backed up his clai m to being God through miraculous feats of healing, astounding demonstrations of power over nature, unrivaled teaching, divine understanding of people, and with his own resurrection, which was the ultimate evidence of his deity. DID JESUS FULFILL THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD? While the incarnation-God becoming man, the infinite becoming finite-stretches our imaginations, prominent theologian D. A. Carson pointed out that there's lots of evidence that Jesus exhibited the characteristics of deity. Ba sed on Philippians 2, many theologians believe Jesus voluntarily emptied himself of the independen t use of his divine attributes as he pursued his mission of human redemption. Even so, the Ne w Testament specifically confirms that Jesus ultimately possessed every qualification of de ity, including omniscience, omnipresence, omnipotence, eternality, and immutability. DID JESUS-AND JESUS ALONE MATCH THE IDENTITY OF THE MESSIAH? Hundreds of years before Jesus was born, proph ets foretold the coming of the Messiah, or the Anointed One, who would redeem God's peopl e. In effect, dozens of these Old Testament prophecies created a fingerprint th at only the true Messiah could f it. This gave Israel a way to rule out imposters and validate the credentials of the authentic Messiah. Against astronomical odds-by one estimate, one chance in a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trilli on, trillion, trillion-Jesus, and only Jesus throughout history, matched this prophetic fingerprint. This confirms Jesus' identity to an incredible degree of certainty. The expert I interviewed on this topi c, Louis Lapides, is an example of someone raised in a conservative Jewish home and who came to believe Jesus is the Messiah after a systematic study of the prophecies. Today, he's a pastor of a church in California and former president of a national network of fifteen messianic congregations. WAS JESUS' DEATH A SHAM, AND HIS RESURRECTION A HOAX? By analyzing the medical and historical data, Dr. Alexander Metherell, a physician who also holds a doctorate in engineering, concluded Jesus could not have survived the gruesome rigors of crucifixion, much less the gaping wound that pierced his lung and heart. In fact, even before the"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"crucifixion he was in serious to critical condition and suffering from hypovolemic shock as the result of a horrific flogging. The idea that he swooned on the cross and pretended to be dead lacks any evidential basis. Roman executioners were grimly efficient, knowing that they themselves would face death if any of their vic tims were to come down from the cross alive. Even if Jesus had somehow lived through the torture, his ghastly condition could never have inspired a worldwide movement based on the prem ise that he had gloriously triumphed over the grave. WAS JESUS' BODY REALLY ABSENT FROM HIS TOMB? William Lane Craig, who has earned two doctorates and written several books on the Resurrection, presented striking evidence that the enduring symbol of Easter -the vacant tomb of Jesus-was a historical re ality. The empty grave is reported or implied in extremely early sources- Mark's Gospel and a creed in 1 Corinthians 15whic h date so closely to th e event that they could not possibly have been products of legend. Th e fact that the Gospels report that women discovered the empty tomb bolsters the story's authenticity, because women's testimony lacked credibility in the first century and thus there would have been no motive to report they found the empty tomb if it weren't true. The site of Je sus' tomb was known to Christians, Jews, and Romans, so it could have been checked by skeptics. In fact, nobody-not even the Roman authorities or Jewish leaders-ev er claimed that the tomb still contained Jesus' body. Instead, they were forced to invent the absurd story that th e disciples, despite having no motive or opportunity, had stolen the body-a theory that not even the most skeptical cr itic believes today.
