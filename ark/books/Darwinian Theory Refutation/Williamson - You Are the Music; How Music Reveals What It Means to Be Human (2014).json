I did not know quite what to think when mypartner Oscar gave me musicpsychology.co.uk [http://www.musicpsychology.co.uk]as a birthday present. He explained himself quickly: I loved talking about thepsychology of music and this was a chance to discuss my passion with the wholeworld. He was right (yes, I said it). The blog soon became my baby and this bookis the culmination of over a decade’s exploration into the wonderful world ofmusic psychology. So thank you Oscar, for everything.I am hugely grateful to all the magnificent people at Icon Books, especially toDuncan Heath, who supported me throughout the writing process, to Andrew Furlowand Henry Lord for their enthusiasm and creativity, and to Robert Sharman forhis keen and careful eye. I am grateful, too, to the talented Richard Green forhis striking cover design. I consider myself very lucky to have had such a greatteam behind my book.Many students, colleagues and friends have been generous with their time indiscussing both this book and the psychological impact of writing it upon theauthor. I could not possibly name all these kind souls but I want to makespecial mention to Joydeep Bhattacharya, Rhiannon Jones, Pamela Heaton, DanielMüllensiefen, Georgina Floridou, Maurice Douglas, Danielle Richardson and TeamBarcelona.Dad, thank you for the baby taming, the music lessons, the instruments, thelifts to music centres, the speakers, the vinyl, the music-filled holidays, andfor reading every chapter of this book with the same vigour and humour that youonce reserved for my maths homework.

ELIOT, FOUR QUARTETSSince you have been so kind as to consider reading this book I am going toassume that you have an interest in music; why we love it so much and how itaffects us. Me too!I promise to assume nothing else about you. To read this book requires no expertknowledge of or training in music, psychology, brain science, or any other kindof academic discipline. All you need with you on this journey is your curiosityabout music.The reason for this book, and for my career, is a passion for music. I am, atbest, an amateur musician. I love my classical guitar (‘The Professor’) but wesee each other rarely these days what with work demands, so my musical interestsdon’t come from the viewpoint of a skilled performer. Nor would I considermyself to be particularly knowledgeable about music. I am not a sophisticatedlistener; more a musical chameleon. I rarely come across music that I don’tenjoy on some level.I put the blame for my music addiction squarely on my dad. When I was born heacquired a lovely book called Baby Taming1 [part0017.html#itfn1] (seriously),which stated that playing loud music at bedtime helps a child to sleep deeplyand with less disruption. I have no idea whether this pop psychology containsany truth – as far as I know the claim has never been tested – but my dad neededlittle encouragement to fire up his Celestion Ditton 66 speakers and crank outthe vinyl every night.As a result of this baby book and my dad’s love of vinyl I have been surroundedby music from day one. Not music practice or performance so much, as neither ofmy parents could play an instrument. Rather, in my family music was in the air.I was fortunate to go to a primary school that offered free instrument lessonsfor a time and I chose to play the guitar, though I also dabbled in mandolin,recorder and flute. I had formal music lessons on classical guitar, with acharming teacher named Andrew Forrest who instilled in me a love of Spanishmusic, especially Fernando Sor, Francisco Tárrega and Isaac Albéniz. I enjoyedmy formal lessons until the age of eighteen but took few music exams as I foundthem too stressful.Alongside my formal music education I had increasing access to my favouritemusic as I grew up thanks to the explosion in the availability of compressedmusic and portable devices. And the music listening revolution has continued inmy adult life with developments like cloud-based systems for musical storage.Today this means that people need never be far away from their top tunes. And Inever am. I am listening to the wonderful Three Tenors as I write thisintroduction. I had BBC music radio playing in my car on the way to work thismorning. My dad’s beloved Celestion Ditton 66 speakers now take pride of placein my living room.Not only am I addicted to music, I am also addicted to working out why I amaddicted to music. (I believe that is what is known as an over-analytical mind.)I blame my passion for studying my musical addiction on a handful ofinspirational academics that I have been lucky enough to meet on my journey as Istudied psychology, the psychology of music, and finally as I began my researchcareer. There are too many people to name individually, though deserving ofspecial mention are my ‘academic fathers’ and inspirations, Professors AlanBaddeley and Graham Hitch.I have devoted my research career to understanding how and why music is so mucha part of our everyday lives. There are already many technical books out therethat explore aspects of music psychology – a young and vibrant science thatexamines the relationship between music and our mind, brain, and body. There arealso excellent compilations, essay collections and student guides, for which Iam hugely grateful as a lecturer. But I wanted a book that I could recommend toa friend who was keen to learn about the impact of music on everyday life: theperson who listens to their iPod on their way to work and who refuses tocontemplate a long car journey without music; the parent who takes their childto musical activity classes or pays for formal music lessons; the person whoowns a shower radio, looks forward to concerts and gigs, shops to a soundtrack,and who carefully selects music for a romantic night to ensure maximumseduction; the person who can’t help but be transported back to that one perfectevening when they hear ‘that song’. I wanted an easy-to-access guide book thatexplained everyday music psychology for everyone – so I decided to write it.This book contains a selection of the findings and theories through whichresearchers have sought to tell the story of our lives with music. My aim inthis book is to consider why we live this way. In terms of music’s power over usI want to have a go at revealing ‘the wizard behind the curtain’.As we shall see in more detail in the pages to come, music can trigger growth inthe brain at any age, a fact which has been linked to enhancement of hearingacuity, language learning and motor control. In children, music lessons havebeen associated with the advanced development of many physiological, social andcognitive skills and in adults music can boost sports performance by up to 15per cent. Music provides a source of communication for those who struggle withlanguage and it can provide significant comfort from both physical and mentalpain. It can help improve recovery from illness and injury, and support andguide transitions through life stages. Finally, it provides a personalsoundtrack and an instant memory passport.Just about everyone is exposed to music every day, whether voluntarily or not.People dedicate their time to its production, performance and consumption. Thereare national music days, where countries celebrate their musical heritage,talents and passions. So the issue is not whether we are engaging with music; infact, we are gorging on it. The secrets of music psychology can help solve thequestion of why music has such an effect upon us. Why do we love it so much? Whyis it everywhere? And how does it have so many effects on our brains, bodies andbehaviours?The underlying concept for the book is ‘the music of our lives’: from the timewe are born to later adulthood. The mapping of music through life in this wayallows a journey to unfold and means that there will, I hope, be something inthe book for everyone.But before we begin, there are some fundamental questions we need to consider.What is music?I was once asked this intriguing question as part of a radio programme hosted byProfessor Lord Robert Winston. I froze completely. What could I say? Over adecade of focused study behind me and I could not think of a single decentresponse. I kicked myself the whole way home from the recording studio, and forseveral days afterwards.I have since forgiven Professor Winston for his excellent question and haveconsidered what my answer might be, given what I have learned so far. I havecome up with the following definition: Music is a universal, human, dynamic,multi-purpose, sound signalling system. That description is not set in stone; itis a work in progress. For now it gives us something to work with for thepurpose of this book.Where did music come from?There are many theories about how music became part of our world. CharlesDarwin’s theory of sexual selection posits that music evolved as a form offitness display to attract potential mates. Or maybe we developed music as a wayto soothe and educate our infants. It might have provided a valuable medium fortribes and families to identify themselves and communicate their socialcooperation. Or maybe music evolved from a proto-language that allowed ourancestors to communicate crucial signals before they developed words andsentences.I have been a firm believer in all these theories of music’s origin, and more,at various points in my career. That is the best way to be as a scientist. Thereis nothing more boring than someone who sticks to the same tired old ideas foryears, refusing to budge or admit they may need a rethink.My preferred explanation at the time of writing comes from Mark Changizi, whomuses about the origins of music and language in his fantastic book Harnessed.2[part0017.html#itfn2] He suggests that our obsession with music arose because it‘harnessed’ so much of nature around us and because it used existing and ancientbrain mechanisms for new and exciting purposes.Music in this sense is not a fundamental part of human life because it’s a partof our souls or the ‘language of love’, tempting as it is to fall back on suchromantic notions. Changizi’s argument stresses that music is a part of usbecause we designed it based on who we were and what we needed as humans. Thehuman animal, our evolving brains and bodies, were the blueprint for music.I like the idea that music is part of what turned us into the modern human thatwe recognise today. Changizi suggests that music, along with language andreading, is what turned apes into humans. We, by this definition, are themusical animal.Are we the only musical animal?We are not the only animal to make musical sounds, although you could argue thatwe have a tendency to anthropomorphise such behaviours. Birds, mice and whalessing, gorillas duet, seals and elephants move to the beat, and so on (seeChapter 6).Despite these examples, to my knowledge there is no other animal on earth thatis as driven by, obsessed with, and vulnerable to the strains of music ashumans. No other animal invests as much in the creation or acquisition ofmusical sound; we devote precious energy to making instruments, constructing andmaintaining music ensembles, producing music for easy consumption, and aspiringto solo musical performance perfection.I do not mean to say that other animals can’t share in aspects of musicalperception, production or enjoyment. It would be a pretty strange world if wehumans had developed a skill that did not exist in any form in any other animal– that would make us a musical alien. My premise for this book is instead thatwe are far and away the most musical animal this planet has ever seen. In thissense our musical lives provide a unique glimpse into what it means to be human.music [../images/00002.jpeg]The book is divided into three sections. The first section deals with music aswe grow up. Chapter 1 begins at the start, with the music we hear before we areeven born. We see that babies come into the world with an impressive catalogueof musical skills that lay the foundation for their musical adulthood. ThroughChapters 2 and 3 we explore the effects of music in childhood through toadolescence, including the link between music and IQ, the ingredients for asuccessful musical education, and the role that music plays in our personal,emotional and social development.The second section takes a look at music in the adult world: the true hiddenmusical talents within us and the transformations that occur in the brain whenan individual trains as a musician (Chapter 4). We will also take a look atindividuals who struggle with music their whole lives and find out what it is tobe ‘tone deaf’. We then take a tour through the music in our modern adult world,at work (Chapter 5) and at play (Chapter 6).The third and final section takes a reflective journey through the importance ofmusic across the whole of the human lifespan. Chapter 7 is devoted to musicalmemory, my personal academic passion. We look at feats of musical memory andexplore cases of musical memory surviving extensive brain damage. Then there isthe intriguing question of why musical memories get stuck in our heads. Finally,we build on these and other studies in Chapter 8 to explore how music can helpsupport health and well-being at all life stages.I can appreciate that this looks like quite a journey – after all, it’s a wholehuman life – but you are free to dip in and out of the book as you like. Thechapters are designed to be largely self-contained so you can jump right to yourpersonal interest, whether it’s musical babies, music lessons, music forromance, music for work, music for exercise, or music for stress relief.So, my fellow musical animal, let’s begin our exploration of what the world ofscience and psychology can tell us about our day-to-day, lifelong, love ofmusic."},{"pageContent":"PART IMusic in early life"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 1First musical steps‘I was born with music inside me. Music was one of my parts. Like my ribs, mykidneys, my liver, my heart. Like my blood. It was a force already within mewhen I arrived on the scene.’RAY CHARLESWolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born in Salzburg in 1756 and went on to become oneof the world’s most prolific and influential composers. Although he lived foronly 35 years and died over 200 years ago, sales of his exquisite musicregularly top the classical music charts and he is frequently voted in the topfive composers of all time.Mozart was playing and composing music by the age of five. Because of this he isoften cited as the prime example of a human being who was ‘born musical’ – farmore musical, in fact, than the rest of us. But was he?There is no doubt that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart had a very early start to hismusical career and that he had a ‘pushy parent’. Johann Georg Leopold Mozart wasone of Europe’s leading music teachers and in the year of his seventh child’sbirth he published his dense textbook Versuch einer gründlichen Violinschule (‘ATreatise on the Fundamental Principles of Violin Playing’). According toreports, little Mozart received intensive musical instruction from his fatherbefore he could even speak.There is such a thing as talent and there are such things as prodigies, thoughour present understanding of both concepts is still hotly debated.1[part0017.html#c1fn1] Perhaps because of this fact I am inclined to believe thatit was mostly Mozart’s unique upbringing that set him apart musically from therest of us. Whether Mozart possessed advanced natural musical ability or not,the point I want to make here is that all babies are born musical, not just ourfinest composers.We are born musical because our first experiences of music are pre-birth, as thewomb is flooded with the musiclike sounds of our world: the pitch glides, themelodies and the beats of body movements, voices, natural and artificial sounds.As a result of this early exposure, newborns come into this world possessing animpressive set of basic musical skills that play an important role in generaldevelopment, quite aside from the issue of whether or not the child goes on tolearn how to play a piano or pluck a violin.When it comes to musicality, everyone had to start somewhere, including Mozart.And as we shall see we all have something in common with Ray Charles: we wereborn with music already inside of us.Music in the wombI have never seen a ‘prega-phone’ but I remember the first time I was told abouttheir existence. I was giving a lecture on music psychology for the OpenUniversity, during which I discussed the origins of musical skills. A member ofthe audience raised their hand to point out that you could improve a baby’slifelong musical skills by playing them music through a microphone strapped to apregnant woman’s tummy: the aptly named prega-phone. It turns out that you canbuy all sorts of similar devices.Given what I knew about music and brain development I thought it unlikely thatintensive prenatal music exposure could benefit later musical development but Iset out to investigate this question anyway. If nothing else, then the next timeI was faced with a similar comment I could be a little more useful to theaudience than simply playing devil’s advocate.Before we look at the effect of prenatal music listening on development, let’sdeal with the first important physiological question: what does music sound likebefore we are born?Music doesn’t sound like anything until about the fourth month of pregnancy, thestage at which human hearing begins to function. It then takes about another twomonths for the fine structures of the ear that detect frequencies (for example,the cochlea) to fully form.2 [part0017.html#c1fn2] At this point an in uterobaby becomes aware of a range of auditory stimulation from the environment. Whatthey actually hear is a matter very much open to debate.Given that a foetus is surrounded by amniotic fluid, we can assume that theyperceive sounds a little like when they are played under water. Not manyswimming pools are fitted with underwater speakers and there is a good reasonfor this; in this submarine environment you may be aware of pitch movements inthe low register, changes in volume and maybe a strong beat, but the fine detailis largely lost. Picking out instruments or singers can be almost impossible,because of the loss of high frequencies, and finer points of melody are alsohard to detect.A developing foetus would find it even harder to follow the exact detail ofmusic early on, as they will be hearing other sounds much closer to them, suchas the mother’s digestive system, air movements through her lungs, and theactivity of her heart and blood vessels.At the time of writing there are no known studies of musical sound in the humanwomb (recordings are only really possible during labour) but recordings inpregnant sheep have found at least a 10-decibel reduction in external soundwithin the womb,3 [part0017.html#c1fn3] with less reduction in low frequencysounds compared to higher frequencies. If you tried to identify words in thiskind of environment you would probably get about 40 per cent of them right.4[part0017.html#c1fn4]What does all this mean for our prega-phone? I have seen no evidence that inutero hearing devices offer anything more in terms of sound transmission than apair of headphones over the abdomen or a seat close to a speaker, although I’massured that they offer some ergonomic comfort for the mother. What isundeniable is that a typically developing foetus can hear what is going on intheir external world during the last trimester.Although we can’t know exactly what a foetus hears in the womb, their brainresponses to sound can be studied using a specially adapted form of fMEG (foetalmagnetoencephalography). This kind of scan requires a mother to kneel with hertummy enclosed with a specially adapted series of sensors (known as a SQUIDarray) that pick up the minute magnetic changes around the foetal head caused bybrain activity.Using the SQUID array device researchers have shown that from around 28 weeksgestation the majority of foetuses can detect frequency changes in the range of250Hz, equivalent to the gap across five white notes in the upper middle sectionof a piano (octave five).5 [part0017.html#c1fn5] What is more, researchconducted during labour using a hydrophone has found that foetal hearing reachesimpressive levels, being described in some studies as near perfect.6[part0017.html#c1fn6]I have often been asked whether a foetus enjoys music in the womb; for example,when a baby kicks in response to music I have heard it said that this is becausethey like the sound. I’m sure I don’t have to tell you that it’s not possible todetermine the aesthetic preferences of a foetus: in terms of their movement andheart rate, being asleep probably appears similar to being bored, and beingexcited probably appears similar to annoyance. That is assuming, of course, thatsuch emotional states are possible in one so young.And while a foetus can certainly respond to music, there is no suggestion thatthis is in any way different to how they respond to all manner of externalauditory stimuli, including sirens, animal cries or, as we shall see in aminute, aircraft take-off. So let’s leave the point of musical preference on oneside for now.Whether or not unborn babies have a preference for sound has little bearing onthe question of whether they remember what they hear. We have known for a longtime that babies can remember sounds that they have experienced in utero becauseof their behaviour once they are born. Newborns respond more frequently andregularly to their mother’s voice, the voice with which they are undoubtedlymost familiar because of the direct transmission it gets through her body.A great example of foetal memory for other sounds was a study conducted withbabies whose mothers had lived near Osaka International Airport, Japan duringpregnancy. After they were born these infants were not woken by, and had littleor no discernible brain wave reaction to, recorded aircraft noise. By comparisonthey were awakened and disturbed by a music sequence that had similarcharacteristics to the sound of planes taking off.7 [part0017.html#c1fn7]In theory therefore a foetus can become accustomed to and remember musicalsounds if they hear them as frequently as those babies heard aircraft take-off –but can newborns really remember complex music, given the increased difficultieswith the muffled nature of the sound?In my previous research post I spent many a happy coffee break chatting aboutlife with our head technician, Maurice, a good friend of mine. When I mentionedI was writing this chapter he told me a story about one of his wife’spregnancies. At the time she was a fan of Neighbours, the long-runningAustralian soap opera. The show had had the same theme tune for years, marked bylarge pitch leaps and a steady beat, two musical features that have a goodchance of getting through to a foetus. Maurice says that when little Matthew wasborn he would react strongly to the Neighbours theme: his face lit up, hesearched around for the source of the sound, and he made animated noises.Maurice is convinced that Matthew remembered the Neighbours theme tune from histime in the womb, as he didn’t react this way to other music.This everyday anecdotal experience of infant response to in utero music issupported by science. In 2011, Carolyn Granier-Deferre and her team played womena novel descending piano melody twice daily during the 35th, 36th, and 37thweeks of their pregnancy.8 [part0017.html#c1fn8] At six weeks old the newbornbabies were played these melodies again while they were asleep, along with asimilar control melody that went up instead of down. The researchers measuredthe heart rates of these 25 babies and compared them to the responses of 25‘control’ babies who had not heard any of the tunes before.All the tunes triggered a decrease in the babies’ heart rates (by about five tosix beats per minute) but the familiar tunes had twice the relaxing effect onthe 25 babies who had heard them in the womb.This extra deceleration in heart rate in response to the downward melodies is aremarkable finding when you consider that the babies had not really heard themelodies very often – probably less frequently than little Matthew had heard theNeighbours theme tune over the course of his mum’s pregnancy and certainly lessthan the Osaka babies had heard aircraft taking off – but still their sleepingheart rate responses gave away the fact that they remembered this musical shape.In utero exposure to music may be limited and missing the full complexity thatwe hear outside the womb, but the fact that babies are sensitive to and canlearn to recognise musical sounds means that by the time they are born they havehad months of exposure to some of the basic features of music (rhythms andcontours) and thereby months of opportunities to learn about musical sound.This finding leads to a series of interesting questions, that take me right backto the comment made by my Open University student: does prenatal exposure impacton later musical skills? Will increasing foetal exposure to music make for amore musical baby or, even more controversially, a smarter baby?The majority of the evidence says ‘no’. Not a single study to date hasconvincingly demonstrated that increasing prenatal music exposure above thetypical amount heard in everyday life improves later musical perception orproduction. It’s not the case, for example, that parents who are both musiciansalways produce a child who is interested in or skilled in music.I doubt that we will ever see evidence for a direct effect of prenatal music onmusical skill either, for one good reason: what happens after a child is born,as with young Mozart, is lilkely to be far more important to musical developmentthan degree of exposure in the womb.It’s important to emphasise that all sounds, whether we think of them as musicalor not, will transmit ‘musical’ information to a foetus due to the qualities ofthe womb environment. In the final trimester a foetus hears the sounds ofvoices, industry, and nature as a series of beats and movements in pitch. It’snot clear how or why flooding the foetus with extra music makes any difference –if anything, such a strategy may block exposure to the wide variety of usefulsounds that they might otherwise hear, such as familiar voices.I will leave it to my next chapter to get into the debate about whether musicalexposure can boost intelligence – suffice to say there is no evidence thatprenatal musical exposure improves intelligence in newborns. And while it may bepossible to create a musical memory for a newborn that they associate withbeneficial relaxation responses, we now know that familiar voices, a humanheartbeat and even planes taking off can all have similar effects.Prenatal music intervention may not lead to a more musical baby or a smarterbaby but the sounds that babies hear in the womb are still important. In thenext section we see how our young are born with some pretty impressive basicmusical skills – partly due to typical in utero sound exposure.There will always be a debate about nature and nurture when it comes tonewborns’ abilities, but exposure to musical aspects of sound in the wombinfluences the development of the building blocks for later musical skills. Thecrucial thing about building blocks, though, is that they are basic and can goonly so far – if you don’t continue to build with them, they will stay at thesame level.Newborn rhythmA newborn’s experience is not the coherent assemblage of sensory streams, neatlyknitted together into a thread of consciousness, which we take for granted as anadult. The American philosopher and psychologist William James famously statedthat the newborn infant perceives their new world ‘as one great blooming,buzzing confusion’.9 [part0017.html#c1fn9] When you think about it, it’s nowonder they cry.In spite of this sensory chaos, newborns are attracted to and can respond tosound patterns that already make a degree of sense to them, and we have justseen how they remember sensory experiences from their time in the womb,particularly ones involving sound.One of the consequences of the early development of hearing in humans, comparedto other senses such as vision, is that babies are born primed with skills thatthey can use to learn about musical patterns in their environment. One of themost important is their sense of ‘the beat’.Rhythms are perhaps the strongest and most coherent lowfrequency auditorymessages that a foetus experiences regularly, hearing as they do the rhythms ofspeech, the rhythms of musical and environmental sounds, and the rhythm of theirmother’s walk and heartbeat. One might suppose, therefore, that if we were to beborn with any musical skills then we must be born with an idea of the beat. Thisappears to be the case.In 2009, István Winkler and colleagues published a landmark paper called‘Newborn infants detect the beat in music’.10 [part0017.html#c1fn10] Theystudied musical skill in infants that were only two to three days old – whilethey were asleep.The researchers took advantage of a feature of our brain responses known as the‘mismatch negativity’, or MMN, which is measured using electroencephalography,or EEG. An EEG scan measures the minute electrical activity across the scalpcaused by brain activity, usually by means of a person wearing what looks like ashower cap covered in wires.The MMN is a particular brain wave pattern that happens in response to a changein an otherwise consistent sequence of environmental events. MMN responses occurin all the senses but of course we are interested in sound. If you hear tenbeeps of a certain note and the eleventh note changes, then your brain will givean MMN response. The MMN is the neural signature that your brain has spotted the‘oddball’, the deviation in your expectation of what should come next. Theinteresting thing is that your brain will show an MMN response whether or notyou are paying attention to the sounds – and this makes it an ideal brainresponse to study in sleeping babies.Winkler and his colleagues used a specially adapted EEG system to measure MMNresponses in newborns, smaller and more delicate than the adult version,accounting for infants’ fine skin and petite features. The researchers fittedthe baby EEG and waited until the babies had a nice big meal and fell asleep.Once the babies were sleeping, they were played sound sequences based on atypical rock drum accompaniment pattern, featuring a snare, bass and hi-hat.Occasionally the pattern missed a downbeat, the first strong beat of a unit ofmusic, which adults hear as a rhythm break or a moment of strong syncopation.The dropped downbeat creates a rhythmic ‘oddball’. Would two- to three-day-oldbabies be aware of this oddball, and show an MMN response?The answer is ‘yes’. Even when asleep the newborns gave an MMN reaction to thedropped beat. Importantly, this reaction wasn’t simply triggered by the missingnote; dropped notes at non-rhythmic points did not trigger an MMN. This evidenceshows that newborn babies can extract the beat from musical sequences. That ispretty impressive for a two-day-old brain, and strongly implies that infants areborn with sensitivity for rhythmical sounds.The researchers of this study suggest that newborns’ beat detection skills mayhave been learned partly because of hearing rhythms in utero and partly due toan innate drive. More specifically, newborns may apply their innate sensitivityfor patterns in order to assemble rhythms and generate expectations in soundsequences. This makes them capable of basic beat induction, which, as we shallsee in Chapter 6, is a skill missing in nearly all other animals on the planet.Beat induction is an example of a basic music building block that is essentialfor later musical behaviours such as playing in synchrony and dancing, and whichappears to be ready and willing to go right from the start of our lives.Newborn name that tuneNewborns’ musical skills extend beyond detecting the beat to include sounddiscrimination based on features such as volume, duration and pitch.11[part0017.html#c1fn11] Not only this, newborns can discriminate betweendifferent contours, the equivalent to spotting the difference between twomelodies, and they can use this information when listening to speech.Thiery Nazzi and colleagues12 [part0017.html#c1fn12] tested French newborns’ability to discriminate between two lists of Japanese words that differed onlyin their contour, either going up or down. The researchers used a measurementtechnique that takes advantage of newborns’ natural inclination to suck. Theygave them a special pacifier that measured every suck, noting its strength andtime of occurrence. They started testing with 121 newborns but, as is often thecase with infant research, they had a few drop-outs: 34 fell asleep (awww),fifteen rejected the special pacifier, seventeen committed the crime of‘irregular or insufficient sucking’, and fifteen did not settle. That leaves uswith 40 willing and able babies.These 40 babies were played one of two word lists for a few minutes; one listcontained words that went up in sound and one comprised words where the contourwent down. During this familiarisation period the baby gets used to the soundand their sucking rate steadies to a consistent rate. Then half the babies – theexperimental group – were played a different list while half – the control group– continued to hear the same list as before.If the babies were capable of discriminating a change to the contour, it waspredicted that their sucking rate would change – they would suck more as theybecame alert to and interested in the new sound. The control babies, who werehearing the same sound, were expected to continue on at a steady suck.This is exactly what happened. The babies in the experimental group clearlynoticed the change in the contour of the Japanese speech, the melody of thewords, before they then settled down to a familiar sucking pattern again.Importantly, all the babies in this study came from French-speaking homes, soit’s almost impossible that their responses could have arisen from priorexposure to Japanese. This result shows newborns’ ability to not only spotdifferences in contour but to do so in unfamiliar speech, hinting at a flexiblesound learning system that could potentially form an important basis forlanguage development.I mentioned earlier how the womb structure fosters the transmission of themusical aspects of speech as a result of the loss of higher frequencies (thespeech detail). These musical aspects of speech include the pattern of contourstresses that we naturally use when we speak our native language. The studyabove shows that newborns can detect these contour changes in unfamiliar speech.Babies can also go one step beyond and use the familiar aspects of musicalspeech contour in their own vocalisations. It might even be the case thatnewborns cry in their native language.13 [part0017.html#c1fn13]Birgit Mampe and colleagues analysed the crying patterns of 30 French and 30German newborns. They studied the ups and downs of their natural cries and itturns out that French babies produce more rising pitches, whereas German babiescry more with falling contours. The same patterns were revealed in intensity:volume went from low to high in French babies while the reverse was found inGerman babies. This difference between a rising and a falling sound mirrors thespeech contours used by native adult speakers of French and German,respectively.The study by Birgit Mampe suggests that babies can not only perceive andremember the musical patterns of the speech they hear in utero but that theyalso mimic these familiar patterns when making their first cries. This isprobably the earliest evidence of the impact of our native language on ourvocalisations – and it’s the musical features of communication that are thefirst to develop.All of these studies support the idea that infants are born with a high level ofsensitivity to the musical aspects of their sonic world; the beats and thecontours that they have heard so far in their young lives. In the next sectionwe will see how this sensitivity is fed and developed by the uniquely musicalworld that our young inhabit.Baby talk – music to their earsWhen my best friend from school had her first baby I couldn’t wait to seepictures. She lives hundreds of miles from me now and I didn’t have time to makethe long trip to see her, so I waited anxiously for an image of her bundle ofjoy. When I finally saw the photos I was overwhelmed with joy; Isobel wascompletely adorable, with her mum’s eyes too.Then I started talking to the photo. ‘Aren’t you the most gorgeous little thing?Oh my goodness, look at you with your little hands and tiny fingers all tuckedup! You are such a sweet little angel, just like your mummy, yes you are, yesyou are …’ Thankfully, no one was in the room with me at the time. Not only wasI talking to a photo; even stranger was the voice I was using to address theimage.My voice would start really low, then shoot up high through the words andrapidly back down again. I was speaking much faster than normal, apart fromlong, high-energy pauses on the start and end of phrases (‘yes’ and ‘are’). Atsome points I was almost squeaking the words.I’m sure you recognise the phenomenon I’m describing – we have all either donethis or heard it done. This kind of vocalisation is known colloquially as‘motherese’ or more formally as infant directed speech (IDS), and it differssignificantly from adult directed speech (ADS).IDS has been reported in every known language tested to date.14[part0017.html#c1fn14] IDS has basic sound features that make it unique: ahigher fundamental frequency (basic pitch level), more intense and exaggeratedcontours and slides, and more repetitive and rhythmical elements. It’s alsofrequently accompanied by rhythmic body movements to the beat of the speechsounds, like nodding or shaking the head, clapping or bouncing. If you spokethis way to an adult then they would likely view you with suspicion. So why dowe speak this way to babies?Here we encounter a chicken and egg problem. Who started doing IDS first, andwhy? There are two possibilities: either adults started to mimic the naturalsounds that babies can make and found this to be beneficial, or babies werenaturally drawn to more musical vocalisations that adults can make.Like all evolutionary arguments, we will probably never solve this riddle toeveryone’s satisfaction: all evidence for the origins of IDS is lost to themists of time. However, finding an answer to this conundrum is not as crucial asthe recognition that IDS suits both adults and babies for different reasons, andthat this is probably why it still exists in all known forms of human culture.Babies prefer to listen to IDS compared to ADS almost as soon as they are born(a strong preference emerges within one month),15 [part0017.html#c1fn15]irrespective of whether it’s spoken by a man or woman.16 [part0017.html#c1fn16]This preference for IDS has even been found in infants born to deaf parents.17[part0017.html#c1fn17] IDS provides a reliable way for adults all over the worldto trigger a positive reciprocal response from their young. It’s a method bywhich we can attract their attention and potentially modify their behaviour, ata developmental stage when verbally reasoning with a baby is tempting butlargely pointless.Another main advantage of IDS for adults is that we get a smile. When we speakto a baby in musical tones, we often get positive feedback that is, frankly,adorable. Their eyes widen, they wave their arms, blow bubbles, giggle andbounce their cute chubby little legs.This happy response has the benefit that the baby is not crying. Scientificevidence shows that parents experience a release of stress hormones in the brainon hearing a baby crying, resulting in an increased heartbeat, raised bloodpressure and a cold sweat.18 [part0017.html#c1fn18] It’s extremely beneficialtherefore to have a technique that can minimise these negative effects on ourown physical state.As much as a baby’s cry can be emotionally and physically distressing, once upona time it was downright dangerous. A screaming baby would have been no good toour ancestors if they were trying to hide from predators or allow theircommunity to get valuable rest in order to restore energy levels. As such, it’san extremely useful survival skill to be able to create a state of calm in ababy by low-energy methods that require only our own voices.In modern times this calming technique remains useful in situations where thebaby’s natural response is not necessarily productive or desirable, such as whenthey must have a vaccination or try a new food. The use of IDS can distract ababy from responses that might be automatic and based on sound evolutionarysurvival principles, such as spitting out an unfamiliar taste, but which may notactually be beneficial for the baby – or the care-giver in the clean whiteshirt.IDS for learningI said before that the benefits of IDS were a two-way street, and that meansthere is something in this for babies too. In fact, when we look closely at thebenefits we see that babies probably get directly useful input from musical IDS,and it may be that IDS has developed as a crucial learning tool for thepreverbal stages of human life.The first obvious benefit of IDS is that babies can respond to adults usingthese sounds. They can’t talk back to us yet but they can soon produce coos,pitch glides, and rhythmic responses. When we interact with babies they mimicour IDS, and in so doing the baby guarantees a safe and nurturing environmentthat is low-threat.Research even suggests that a baby’s engaging behaviour in response to IDS canmake them more attractive to adults who are not their parents.19[part0017.html#c1fn19] A human baby can’t hope to survive without the help andsupport of adults therefore it’s in their interests to attract and maintain ourattention, and to stimulate positive responses. When you are largely immobile,your voice is one of your best tools.In learning how to mimic, babies also build one of their first communicativeskills that will become valuable both in their behaviour and speech: the conceptof turn-taking. You speak, and then I speak in response to your message. Thisway we form an understanding, we develop ideas and we effectively transmitinformation.One of the oldest functions of musical IDS was probably to communicate emotionalstate. IDS exaggerates the features of our own emotional speech, such ashigh-pitched, fast sounds when we are happy and low-pitched, slow sounds when weare sad. Not only do caregivers use these features of IDS to communicateemotional information to babies, they also use them to modify a baby’s emotionalstate.20 [part0017.html#c1fn20]In 2002, Laurel Trainor and Renée Desjardins defined another linguistic benefitof IDS. They were interested in the way that IDS exaggerates ‘formantfrequencies’ – the frequencies that emerge as a consequence of the way we useour vocal tract to produce different vowel sounds.21 [part0017.html#c1fn21] Theyhypothesised that these special pitch contours in IDS may serve as a clue to thelocation of vowels in speech and may therefore help babies to learn anddiscriminate these crucial language sounds.One of the great pieces of anecdotal evidence that the researchers cited insupport of this idea was a study showing that ‘pet directed speech’ containsmany of the features of IDS (such as high pitch) but not the IDS focus on voweldifferences.22 [part0017.html#c1fn22] After all, there’s little point in tryingto teach your favourite pooch to speak.Trainor and Desjardins tested 96 babies between the ages of six and seven monthsand looked at their ability to discriminate between two English vowels, /i/ asin heed and /I/ as in hid.23 [part0017.html#c1fn23] The crucial comparison forour interests was between the steady state and pitch contour versions of thesesounds, which are equivalent to the sounds made by ADS and IDS respectively.The method they used to measure the babies’ responses was the ‘conditioned headturn procedure’. This method is based on the premise that once a baby is used toa sound it will then only turn its head if it hears a different sound.Therefore, if the baby turns its head then this is an indication that it is ableto discriminate two sounds. In the IDS study, everyone but the baby woreheadphones, so there could be no question of adult influence on the baby’sresponse.The researchers found that the babies were much better at recognising a changeto a vowel when they heard IDS as compared to ADS. They concluded that IDScontains musical features that can help babies to learn about different voweltypes long before they are able to make use of this information. Our musicalspeech may therefore help our young to build the foundations of their languagelearning.Musical meaningYou might think that learning about vowels is sophisticated enough for asix-month-old but musical IDS may serve an even higher function in languagelearning: the ability to communicate the meaning of a message.As an adult we are blessed with syntax, semantics and prosody (pitch movements,points of focus and rhythm) with which to convey meaning. When trying tocommunicate with preverbal infants, we are limited to prosody cues so we tend toexaggerate them; hence musical IDS. This allows us to quickly get across basicintention messages such as a prohibitive gesture (‘No, don’t touch’), approval(‘Aren’t you a clever baby!’), direction (‘Lie down, it’s sleepy time now’) andcomfort (‘It’s okay, it’s okay, daddy’s here’).There is an interesting developmental trajectory to babies’ liking for IDS,which mirrors their mental and physical development over the first year of life.Christine Kitamura and Christa Lam studied three-, six- and ninemonth-oldinfants and looked at their preferences for IDS that communicated differentintentions; whether a mother was attempting to communicate comfort, approval ordirective intent.24 [part0017.html#c1fn24]They found that babies go through stages of preferring comfort messages whenthey are youngest, to then responding more to approval, and finally, around ninemonths, being more attracted to directive communications. The conclusion wasthat as a baby learns more about language they are more drawn to IDS that hasphonetic and instructive content as opposed to simple, repeating sounds.It’s one thing to show that babies can respond to the meaning and intentions ofmusical IDS; it’s quite another thing to show that these intentions are actuallyunderstood.Elena Sakkalou and Merideth Gattis studied the effect of prosody on younginfants’ (average age sixteen months) ability to distinguish whether an adultaction was intentional or accidental.25 [part0017.html#c1fn25] In theirexperiment, an adult performed two versions of an action, such as dropping atoy, one with intention (‘There’) and one with accidental speech (‘Whoops’). Theactor kept a neutral face and posture so the sound of the utterance was the onlyclue to their intention. It turns out the infants were significantly more likelyto respond and copy the intentional action compared to the accidental one,indicating that they had understood the core meaning of the musical IDS.Taking everything into account, it appears that IDS has multiple uses, which isno doubt the main reason why it exists all over the world. Although studies oflanguage acquisition in babies are appealing, it’s probably stretching things toclaim that IDS is a vital language-learning tool. One argument against this ideais that children will pick up language almost irrespective of how much adultsspeak to them26 [part0017.html#c1fn26] (except in rare cases of extremeneglect). In my opinion, however, the research presented here supports the ideathat the musical features of IDS have an important role to play in our preverbaldevelopment.Verbal development is not the only potential benefit of IDS. In our evolutionarypast IDS likely provided a valuable way to stimulate pair-bonding, facilitatebehavioural learning and modulate stress responses. IDS also provides adultswith an invaluable way to interact with babies in the period before they canspeak – when they are at their most physically vulnerable and when it’s mostcrucial for us to communicate basic intentions and feelings.music [../images/00002.jpeg]In this chapter I wanted to tackle a few urban myths about the idea that only afew of us are really born musical. We have seen that just about every baby isborn with the building blocks of musical skills, thanks to the early developmentof our hearing system and our ability to detect a good proportion of the soundfrom the outer and inner world. No evidence that I have ever seen has convincedme flooding this early environment with extra music is beneficial.Babies learn and remember musical patterns that they hear as part of everyday inutero life whether we, as adults, consider those sounds to be music or not.These everyday tunes of life trigger happy and relaxed responses after birth,especially the music that newborns have heard most often: their mother’s voiceand heartbeat.Babies’ memories of womb music influence their newborn perception of patterns insound, drive their interest in melodic patterns, and influence their firstattempts at vocalisations. No doubt the musical nature of our newborns is one ofthe reasons why we developed a musical way to communicate with them in the formof IDS. We don’t yet fully understand why we instinctively speak to our young inthis musical way but there’s no doubt that IDS benefits both adults and babiesby stimulating early interactions, promoting care-giving, and providing a fewearly lessons in the nature of complex cognitions like emotion and language.In the next chapter we move on from babies to consider the musical world of ourchildren. We break a few more urban myths, such as the idea that listening tomusic (and in particular our friend Mozart) can help make children smarter. Wealso look at some of the potential developmental benefits of engaging in musicalactivities and show how the building blocks of musical understanding that wehave seen in babies continue to take shape in our children through simpleeveryday musical exposure."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 2Music in childhood‘Kids: they dance before they learn there is anything that isn’t music’WILLIAM STAFFORDTime flies. One minute your little bundle of joy is producing their firstbabbles, cautiously lifting their head from their blanket and perfecting theirgummy smile. Then before you can blink they are mobile and everything must beswiftly babyproofed. You must keep a sharp eye out for their passionate desireto put anything and everything into their mouth. Curious coos become firstbabbled words and that firm, unyielding grasp reflex evolves into delicate,intentional movements. Booties become shoes and we all emerge triumphant fromthe potty training trials. The baby is becoming a child.In this chapter we will look at some of the burning questions that parentsencounter when considering the role that music might play in their child’s life.Behind most of these queries is a single, simple, need-to-know: will musicimprove my child’s life?One frequently asked version of this question is whether music makes a childsmarter. I will start by facing up to that thorny issue. Another relatedquestion: what skills will music lessons give my child, other than the abilityto sing or play their chosen instrument? Music performance is a valuableability, but we are talking about investment here. Very few children go on tomake their living via music performance or composition and for the investment ittakes to become a professional musician many a parent would hope that you getsome side bonuses. We will look at the evidence for such ‘transfer’ benefits.Then we will dive into music education research to tackle the question of whatmakes for a successful musical education. What instrument is right for my child?What makes one child press on with their lessons while another loses interest?Finally, we will consider the impact of music on childhood outside the world offormal training. A child’s world is even more musical than that of your averageadult: young children still hear musical IDS, many attend music groups that mayor may not teach instruments, and general education often features music aswell. Songs are used to teach social etiquette and community values, as well asmaths, languages and physical education. On top of this, children’s televisionis crammed full of music that children seem to love but which often drivesadults crazy. How is all this exposure to music impacting on the way ourchildren develop?Mozart for a smarter child?In childhood we can begin to assess the question posed in Chapter 1 regardingthe effects of music on intelligence. In babies this is almost impossible tomeasure; IQ tests for babies make little sense given their limited ability torespond. However, once a child begins to reliably communicate their intentionsand understanding of the world then we can begin to assess their cognitivestrengths.The question of a link between music and intellect is also important in apractical sense as a child starts to show an active interest in engaging withmusic: dancing, singing, and playing instruments. At this point parents arelikely to think about whether to involve their child in music groups or musiclessons, or to invest in a music player for their room. Perhaps a few MozartCDs? Hang on … hold that thought. Let’s take a look at the evidence.A friend recently told me that he has taken to playing Mozart CDs to his youngdaughter while she is falling asleep in the hope of invoking the ‘Mozarteffect’.1 [part0017.html#c2fn1] He hopes that listening to Mozart’s music willtrigger a boost in his child’s intelligence, an idea that has now firmly madeits way into pop psychology legend.In fact, the Mozart effect is often one of the first things people ask me aboutwhen I tell them that I’m a music psychologist. It has its own Wikipedia pageand a substantial industry has grown up around the idea that playing a certainkind of music has benefits for IQ. A well-balanced glance through theliterature, however, reveals that all is not what it seems.It all started innocently enough in 1993, with a one-page paper in the journalNature by Frances Rauscher and colleagues.2 [part0017.html#c2fn2] They conductedan experiment where US college students were played either ten minutes ofMozart’s Sonata for two Pianos in D major (KV448), or listened to relaxationinstructions or sat in silence. The researchers then asked the students tocomplete a test of spatial-temporal reasoning. This type of task (paper-folding,matrices, or pattern analysis) requires you to think in your mind’s eye aboutshapes and how they might fit together. The researchers found a significantlyhigher score on the test only after listening to the Mozart piece, whichtranslated to a boost of between eight and nine IQ points.The researchers went on to replicate their findings but found no similar boosteffects after ten minutes of music by Philip Glass, British trance music,relaxation instructions or an audio book.3 [part0017.html#c2fn3] The Mozarteffect seemed like a very exciting and important finding that might suggest aparticular type of music has a positive effect on our ability to think.How might this effect work? Rauscher and her colleagues speculated that hearingMozart’s music might strengthen neural firing in an area of the brain that alsosupports performance on spatial-temporal tasks.It all seemed too good to be true: a simple solution (listen to music) to acomplex problem (boost mental power). Sure enough, all was not what it appeared.The first issue is the temporary nature of the effect. To be fair, the originalauthors stated that the effect only lasts approximately ten minutes so we werenever talking about any permanent boost to thinking. The problem is that inwider pop science culture you often lose an important bit of information likethis from the original research, which in fact points to a key limitation withthe effect.A second issue with the effect is its specificity. In a subsequent article theoriginal authors suggested that a researcher needed to use exactly theirexperimental conditions in order to have a hope of getting an effect.4[part0017.html#c2fn4] This limitation suggests that the effect is not a verygeneral one.On top of all this, more recent studies have shown that you can get a similarboost effect if you play Schubert’s piano music, when people prefer Schubert toMozart.5 [part0017.html#c2fn5] You can also get the boost effect when you readpeople a bit of Stephen King, if they enjoy his writing.6 [part0017.html#c2fn6]Following such results, researchers have proposed that the Mozart effectactually relies on a temporary improvement to our mood and arousal states (howawake we feel),7 [part0017.html#c2fn7] which then has a positive effect on ourtask performance. And you don’t necessarily need Mozart to boost your mood.The final big issue with the Mozart effect is the failure to replicate. Thenumbers of studies I know about that have failed to replicate this effect nowoutweigh those that have worked.8 [part0017.html#c2fn8] I even have personalexperience of trying to replicate the original paradigm. I followed the recipeof the original study to the letter with high hopes. It didn’t work.Taking all the evidence from the Mozart effect into account over the years, itis now largely accepted that simple passive (listening) exposure to music doesnot boost IQ, cognitive function, or reasoning ability in the long term,9[part0017.html#c2fn9] and that any temporary small boosts to task performanceare due to a concurrent increase in mood and arousal.10 [part0017.html#c2fn10]So by all means, buy a child a Mozart CD if they like listening to his music,enjoy twirling and swaying to the sounds, find it relaxing as part of a sleeproutine, or perhaps soothing in times of illness. The lesson from the researchin this area is that we must not expect a child’s IQ to grow in response tohearing music as if we were feeding fertiliser to a rose.The Mozart effect story may not meet all the hype and false promise that hassurrounded it over the years but it does have a positive ending. Thanks to theexposure of this science story in the media there has been a renewed interest inengaging children with music across the world and several industries havedeveloped that use musical games and activities as part of playgroups andeducational settings. As we’ll see later, these alternative forms of activemusical engagement (rather than just passive listening), while not asinfluential as music lessons, can have positive effects on child development.Music lessons for a smarter child?Passive listening to music may only ever have temporary effects on our mentalprocessing power but active musical involvement can have long-term effects. Toparaphrase Nina Kraus, of whom we will hear more in a moment: you won’t get fitwatching sports on TV – you will get fit if you work out.Let me be blunt to begin with. If performing music made more intelligent humanbeings then all professional musicians should have consistently higher IQs thansimilarly educated non-musicians. Put simply, they don’t. Musicians do better oncertain tests of cognitive function (more on this in Chapter 4) but not ongeneral IQ tests. In one study musicians even performed worse.11[part0017.html#c2fn11]When is anything in life ever that simple? If playing music automatically madeus smarter, then scientists would have shouted it from the rooftops long ago. Solet’s put that idea aside and get more specific. Maybe an effect of music on IQis harder to find in adults because so many other things come into play – alifetime of education and experience in other domains. How about children whotake music lessons: do they have higher IQs?A comprehensive series of studies on the link between music lessons and IQ inchildren has been conducted by Glenn Schellenberg. In 2004 Schellenberg randomlyassigned 144 sixyear-old children from Toronto to one of four groups: keyboardor singing lessons, drama lessons, or a control group who had no extralessons.12 [part0017.html#c2fn12] In order to be fair, the control group wereoffered the same lessons as the other children after the trial period was over.Lessons ran for 36 weeks at a dedicated school in group sizes of around sixpupils. All the children completed IQ tests in the summer break before theybegan their lessons and at the end of the study. Matched measures of age andsocioeconomic status were taken.After one year the vast majority of the children got better at the IQ test,which makes sense as they were a year older. However, the two music groupsshowed larger IQ improvements compared to the drama or control group. The IQincrease was small – equivalent to three or four IQ points – but it was there,and this effect was replicated in a similar study two years later.13[part0017.html#c2fn13] In both studies the achievements on the IQ tests weremirrored in classroom performance.Does this small difference in childhood IQ really mean anything, given the lackof a similar IQ difference between adult musicians and non-musicians?On the positive side, it may be that a childhood boost in IQ helps or reflectsdevelopment in other areas of the brain that may aid later mental function. Forexample, adult musicians show improved verbal learning and memory compared tosimilarly educated people with no musical training (more on this in Chapter 4).It could be that these early childhood IQ differences are an early marker oflater adult differences in cognitive ability.On the negative side, we are talking about three to four IQ points here for ayear of lessons. Is that really worth writing home about? It’s interesting forpsychologists but in a practical sense it doesn’t seem fair to put a childthrough a year of lessons for such a gain, especially if they aren’t enjoyingthemselves. And psychologists are not even convinced that music lessons actuallycause IQ boosts. All that the above research establishes is that a relationshipexists between music lessons and IQ, not that one leads to other. It does notrule out all possible other ‘hidden’ variables that might be driving thedifference. And it may be that those children who are predisposed to higher IQgains at younger ages are more likely to choose and/or respond well to musiclessons.14 [part0017.html#c2fn14]After all that, maybe it’s not wise to treat IQ as the be all and end all ofchild development. There are other potential ‘transfer’ benefits from musiclessons that, for my money, are more direct and more interesting. So let’s focuson them now.Benefits of music lessonsMusical performance ability can be defined as a ‘super skill’ because it makesmany varying demands on the mind and body. To achieve this ability requires longperiods of concentrated attention and learning in areas such as auditory focusand direction, motor movement and coordination, pattern recognition and decoding(plus learning to read music in the first place), sensory integration, andemotional communication. On top of that, a child must absorb the rules ofmusical styles, structures and cultural traditions of performance.All told, learning how to play an instrument or perform with one’s voice is anextremely complicated business and because of this there is a list of relatedskills that may receive a boost along the way.What follows is not an exhaustive list of the possible transfer benefits ofmusic lessons; these are too wide-ranging to discuss in depth and often lackclear evidence. Instead I focus on two areas where a positive impact of musiclessons on a child’s development has been reported and, importantly, replicated:hearing and listening, and language and reading.Hearing and listeningThe first benefit of music lessons, most obviously, is that children’s hearingskills tend to get better. This boost happens quickly and studies have reportedeffects of training on hearing within one year.15 [part0017.html#c2fn15] Thisimprovement in hearing skills has direct benefits for tests of musical ability16[part0017.html#c2fn16] but can also extend into more general listening tasks.Here we will turn to the work of Nina Kraus.Kraus runs an auditory neuroscience lab at Northwestern University, USA. Overthe last few years her research group has conducted many studies of hearingskills in children who take music lessons. Her team believes that music lessonscan help shape the brain for hearing tasks in ways that extend beyond theimmediate demands of their musical education. Kraus refers to this concept as‘music for a smarter ear’,17 [part0017.html#c2fn17] a phrase that sums up herlab’s findings rather nicely.In particular, her group has found an advantage for musical children when itcomes to hearing speech in noise. Hearing in noise (HIN) is an important abilityin younger years as children often find themselves trying to understand andlearn words in noisy environments like classrooms or playgrounds. HIN requires achild to focus on certain characteristics of a sound, such as its pitch, timbreand rhythmic patterns, in order to isolate, lock in on and track its developmentin a complex soundscape.Dana Strait, Kraus and their colleagues18 [part0017.html#c2fn18] reported that agroup of children (aged seven to thirteen) who were taking music lessons showedsuperior HIN ability compared to their non-musician classmates who were matchedon IQ and basic hearing skills. Furthermore, the ability of the musical childrenon HIN tests was significantly related to hours of weekly practice; more musicpractice equals better HIN ability.How might musical training help to boost hearing skills? According to BharathChandrasekaran and Kraus,19 [part0017.html#c2fn19] this effect is due to theplastic (i.e. malleable) nature of the brain. The auditory system has‘feedforward’ neurons that transmit information about sound to the brain but italso has lots of ‘feedback’ neurons that carry information backwards from thebrain to the ears. The higher centres of the brain use these feedback pathwaysto provide guidance for the auditory system on how to focus and track sounds.This process refines our everyday perception of sound – it tunes our ears. AgainI will quote Kraus: ‘What we do with what we hear changes the way our nervoussystem responds to sound.’20 [part0017.html#c2fn20]Of course, there is always the question of whether musical training causesimprovement to listening skills or whether these improved systems are in placeto start with in children who choose to take music lessons; you will recall thisissue of causality from our discussion on music and IQ. Kraus argues for aninfluence of musical training on listening ability rather than vice versa, basedon the strong and consistent relationship between the number of years that achild has been training and their task performance.A child’s ability to process spoken language is undoubtedly connected to thetypes of listening skills I have been describing. And children who take musiclessons show an aboveaverage boost in related areas such as memory for sound, askill that may contribute to the improvement of HIN.21 [part0017.html#c2fn21]But there are some skills that are not so directly related to basic soundprocessing that also appear to receive a boost related to music lessons – namelylanguage processing and reading.Language and readingSylvain Moreno has looked into the effects of musical training on children’sdevelopment for many years and has frequently found a boost in the way that theyprocess language. In 2006 he and Mireille Besson conducted an experiment todetermine whether short-term musical training (eight weeks) would helpeight-year-old children to detect pitch changes in language.22[part0017.html#c2fn22]All the children were tested beforehand on their ability to detect pitch changesin simple spoken sentences. The researchers looked at their accuracy andresponse times, and their brain responses. To assess brain responses they usedEEG as described in the previous chapter, a contraption resembling a swimmingcap covered in wires, which registers the brain’s electrical activity. In thiscase the researchers were interested to measure brain responses to pitchchanges.After all the initial language measures were collected, ten of the childrenstarted eight weeks of music lessons while ten began eight weeks of paintinglessons. When all the children took the language test again, the researchersfound no difference in their performance but they did see a difference in thebrain activity of the children who had taken music lessons. Their brainresponses were stronger when pitch changed compared to the children who hadenjoyed the painting lessons. In this case it appears that only eight weeks ofmusic lessons had modified the way that the brain responds to language sounds.The authors followed up: what happens after more longterm training? How aboutsix months? The idea was the same: divide the children into two matched groups,one that takes music lessons and one that takes painting lessons. In this casethe sample was slightly larger, 32 children from two elementary schools innorthern Portugal, all of whom had similar socioeconomic backgrounds.23[part0017.html#c2fn23]Before the training began the two groups showed no difference in a number ofstandard tests including memory and reading ability. They also showed nodifference in pitch discrimination.The musical classes included lessons about rhythm, melody, harmony and timbre.24[part0017.html#c2fn24] In the painting lessons the children were taught todistinguish and create different colours, about form and space perception,linear perspectives and the nature of different materials and textures. At theend of the year the children in the music group gave a public performance andthe children in the painting group had a show of their best creations.This time, after a longer period of lessons, the researchers found a much biggergroup difference. The children who took music training now had significantlybetter scores on sentence discrimination (as well as pitch discrimination) andwere also faster at the tests compared to the children who had taken paintinglessons. The researchers replicated their earlier result with the brain EEG:musical children showed a stronger and more robust brain response to pitchchanges in language.Together these studies imply that a relatively short period of time spent onmusic lessons can have a positive influence on the way that a child processeswords and that this effect gets stronger as a child continues their lessons.As yet we do not know whether these effects are sustained if a child stops theirlessons or if there is a continued ‘dose effect’ whereby more lessons, orlessons on more instruments, produces a stronger result. What is clear is thatmusic lessons appear to have a significant effect on the way that a child’sbrain responds to language and that after only a few months this developmentwill have consequences for the way they react to sound in the real world.Another interesting result in the six-month study was an improvement in readingability within the music group but not the painting group. This result suggeststhat music lessons can improve the development of the word representations inthe mind that are necessary for reading.25 [part0017.html#c2fn25]These language learning findings may be partly linked back to the responses ofthe auditory brainstem – the way that musical training tunes the ears. DanaStrait, Jane Hornickel and Nina Kraus26 [part0017.html#c2fn26] reportedrelationships between brain responses, musical aptitude and reading ability in42 children. The poorer readers in their study showed less robust brainstemresponses to various aspects of speech sounds.Overall, the story of transfer effects from music lessons is still one where themost convincing positive evidence relates to skills that are trained as part andparcel of the music lessons. We have looked at hearing and the musical aspectsof language processing, up to more complex cognitive skills such as reading.There are a number of possible transfer effects that I have not mentioned herewhere the evidence is more variable, including visual, motor and spatial skillsas well as concentration, emotional senstitivity, creativity and selfconfidence.An excellent review on this vast area of literature has been written by SusanHallam.27 [part0017.html#c2fn27]The take-away message when it comes to transfer effects is not to get carriedaway in assuming that musical lessons will boost the brain and behaviour inevery sense. Having said this, there is now little doubt that musical training,being a ‘super skill’, brings rewards and benefits beyond those directly relatedto musical performance.Effective musical educationWe’ve established that music lessons can bring benefits during development solet’s look at the nature of music lessons themselves. I am not a professionalmusician but I taught music for thirteen years. I was lucky enough to teach anumber of wonderful children who were keen to play the classical guitar, and whotypically started lessons between the ages of five and ten. I taught boys andgirls, individually and in groups, in schools and at home.Over the years I saw some children struggle, some flourish, some fade ininterest, and one – my star pupil Patrick – overtake me. One of the best days ofmy life was when I had to tell his father that I simply could not take his moneyfor lessons any more, as Paddy could do everything that I could do … and more!There are countless individual differences and situational factors that playinto whether a child responds well to their music lessons or loses interest. Butthere are also several aspects to music education that can predict whetherlessons are likely to be effective and over which parents/carers and teachershave a degree of control: here I will tell you about choice of instrument,teacher selection, degree of reward and motivation, and practice strategies.I am not presenting myself as a music education guru here and it’s not my aim tocompare or rate different musical education techniques. What I’d like to giveyou is the evidence regarding some of the general factors that contribute to asuccessful musical education that can be adopted and used by anyone.Choosing an instrumentLet’s start at the beginning. What instrument would I recommend for a child? Ihave been asked this question many times, mostly by friends when their childreaches about five years old. Studies have shown that instrument choice, andmore specifically who makes that choice, can influence the success of musicaleducation. When it comes to instrument selection a child should have a strongsay, if not the complete say, in what they want to learn.28[part0017.html#c2fn28]Ask yourself, what sounds does your child enjoy hearing? What type of music getsthem up and dancing? What shape/colour/feel of instrument do they get excitedabout? These may seem like trivial concerns but giving a child the choice overtheir musical instrument (or voice) has a big impact on their drive to getinvolved in their lessons, which in itself will have positive consequences forlater development in motivation.There is a proviso when it comes to instrument choice: a parent should try tomatch the demands of the instrument to the child’s development so as not to putthem off by giving them too great a physical challenge at the start. This couldseriously damage their motivation before it has even got going. There are manyoptions, so for example you could try a recorder for a child who is interestedin the flute but who struggles with breathing difficulties. Playing the recorderwill teach them the basic fingering they need for the flute and help them workon their breathing.Another consideration with instrument choice is size. You might go for akeyboard or a smaller brass instrument for a child who has their heart set on agrand piano or a tuba but needs time to grow a little first. When my pupilPatrick started learning guitar at the tender age of five he played the sweetestlittle quarter-size guitar. At the beginning of our time together he often triedto get hold of my full-size guitar but soon realised that he could make muchbetter noises on his own as he could reach all the strings.A music teacher will be able to give advice on the ideal starter instrument fora child and you never know, they may end up loving it and never moving on! Istill have a soft spot for the recorder and have three in the spare room that Ienjoy playing now and again. Another plus point of this strategy to bear in mindis that diversity of instrument experience is associated with later musicalexcellence.Choosing a teacherSo, you’ve chosen the instrument – now what about the teacher? A child’s firstteacher can exert a powerful influence on future musical development but thisdepends much more on the match between personality and temperament in the childand teacher, in the dynamics of their relationship, than in the teacher’s levelof technical ability or performance credentials.29 [part0017.html#c2fn29]I was only fifteen when I began teaching; neither technically advanced norconcert-experienced. I now know however, that those things are not so importantwhen a child is just beginning their lessons and needs to learn the basics ofmaking sounds, reading music and/or ear-training skills. You can afford to savethe expert teachers for later when specialist skills are more important in amusical role model; this is about getting started and gaining motivationmomentum.When asked about their first teacher, young expert conservatoire musiciansreported that they remembered them as warm, friendly, and encouraging; in somecases the teacher was even seen as a member of the family.30[part0017.html#c2fn30] Able young performers often change teachers within two orthree years and some have lots of different music teachers: their band,orchestra or choir leader, their school/theory music teacher, and eventuallytheir instrument/voice specialist.Successful musicians tend to report having had more teachers than those who donot achieve such a high standard.31 [part0017.html#c2fn31] That firstrelationship is all-important, however, so a keen-eyed parent should observe afew lessons to check out the dynamics of the relationship and ask the child howthey feel about the teacher.Are there any differences between boys and girls? Jane Davidson and colleaguescarried out an interview study of 257 children to determine how they saw theirteachers and how this related to their later level of musical achievement.32[part0017.html#c2fn32] The researchers found no gender differences in theratings of first teachers – encouragement and friendly, relaxed support wereimportant for all.Maintaining motivationIt goes without saying that lessons must be seen as enjoyable by a child inorder to maintain their interest in this extra form of education, but what mightbe less obvious is the level on which it should be a rewarding experience. Thereis an important shift that must happen within musical and indeed any form ofeducation – that from external to internal (or intrinsic) motivation.33[part0017.html#c2fn33]External motivators tend to come first and they can be anything from atoken-based reward system (for example, ten minutes on a favourite computer gameat the end of each lesson) to a performance achievement (for example, an examcertificate or applause in the school assembly) or simply the smile andattention of a parent. These are all crucial in the early stages of learningwhen the benefits of music lessons, other than making an enjoyable sound, may besomewhat lost on a young child.Performers who continue on to high standards will then develop their owninternal motivation to practise and perform. They carry out these activitiesbecause it makes them feel good, gives them a sense of achievement and drivesthem to reach higher goals. This process shift from external to internalmotivation is not something that you can influence directly, but it won’t happenat all without effective early external motivation. And internal motivation issomething that you can look out for and praise when you start to recognise thesigns.PracticeEffective music lessons are nothing without effective practice.34[part0017.html#c2fn34] This was the one major stumbling block that I experiencedduring my teaching career and one that was common in children who ended upgiving up on their lessons. No effective practice between lessons means littleif any progress in general. In fact, as a teacher you often find yourself havingto go backwards at the start of a lesson to get to the level that you reached atthe end of the last session.We have talked about music lessons in terms of making them enjoyable (helped bychoice of instrument and teacher), stimulating reward, and the transition toself-motivated, internal reward systems. The same all goes for practice. Thereis an additional secret to practice strategy in music – it must be ‘deliberate’.‘Deliberate practice’ is a term that comes from the literature on the psychologyof expertise.35 [part0017.html#c2fn35] In musical terms deliberate practice isdefined as the ability to imagine, monitor and control performance, and the useof optimal strategies to aid progress. Rather than playing or singing at thesame level for a long period of time because you are good at it, repeatingpieces that you can perform well already, deliberate practice requires aconstant self-evaluation, focusing on weaknesses.36 [part0017.html#c2fn36]Instead of playing or singing pieces from start to end, a musician should aim todevelop their own strategies for identifying and correcting mistakes. One of thekey factors here is the development of self-regulation.37 [part0017.html#c2fn37]Musical practice that targets weaknesses and develops mental strategies ofself-regulation is a better predictor of success than just the number of hoursspent playing or singing.38 [part0017.html#c2fn38]Another important factor in effective practice is getting a balance betweenformal and informal strategies. Simply repeating technical exercises over andover again is a less successful strategy than balancing this necessity with timefor improvising and experimentation on the instrument or with the voice.39[part0017.html#c2fn39] By a similar notion, routine is very important forlessons and practice structure but so is the occasional surprise task or rewardthat can refresh interest and encourage confidence to improve further.40[part0017.html#c2fn40]One of the unsung heroes in the development of effective practice, and anindispensible source of that all-important external motivation for early days,is, of course, the parent/carer. Many studies of young successful musicians havepointed out that support in the home is absolutely essential in terms ofencouraging regular, deliberate and effective practice.41 [part0017.html#c2fn41]Motivation to please a parent/carer can predict early progress and even once thetransition to internal motivation has kicked in, many conservatoire studentsstill report a desire to inspire pride in their elders.42 [part0017.html#c2fn42]For parents/carers there has to be a degree of tough love for those occasions inthe early days when a child does not want to practise as well as do theirhomework, as long as the child is still enjoying their instrument and lessons ingeneral. A regularly present and consistently supportive parent/carer may not beable to advise directly on the technical aspects of playing or practice strategybut their presence is eventually worth its weight in music education gold.Getting the most from an effective musical education requires time and effortfrom all the key stakeholders (child, parent/carer and teacher), especially atthe beginning. A child’s enjoyment, motivation and sense of achievement withmusic may come from many different sources but in the early stages all thesefactors must be fed and encouraged by friendly and supportive adults. In time,as self-regulation, internal motivation and effective deliberate practicestrategies develop, both parents and teachers will be able to take a step backand the child will emerge with all the right sustainable tools to pushthemselves through their education as far as they desire.And if they are anything like my pupil Patrick, then they will surpass yourhopes and never look back. Paddy was not one of the very few who go on to becomea world-class professional musician but he is a skilled guitarist and asensitive performer with a talent for composition. The CDs and MP3s I have ofhim playing his own music are among my most prized possessions.Music for general developmentAt the beginning of this chapter we looked at the evidence for the Mozart effectand concluded that passive exposure to music (listening alone) is unlikely toresult in significant improvements to IQ or cognitive skills. I would like toend the chapter by making clear that I do not mean to say that music activitieshave no benefit for children. There are a number of areas in development whereengagement with music that falls short of formal training can play a substantialpositive role and promote learning about the world.Engaging with music is not limited to learning how to play an instrument orsing. In recent years I have been lucky enough to be involved in a researchproject with a pre-school active music class provider in the UK. These types ofsessions are becoming more common all over the world. The classes do not aim toteach children a specific instrument or voice skills, although they ofteninvolve singing. The musical activities and games that these classes involve arelargely for pleasure without any aim of improving performance.Classes such as these provide a fun atmosphere for socialising with otherchildren, teach songs that can help simple behavioural routines (such as goingto bed or brushing teeth), and communicate social skills, such as turn-taking,imitation and bonding. Because they often involve moving to music or playingdrums, the classes also promote motor coordination, synchronisation anddevelopment.Music is not an essential component for all these cognitive, social and motordevelopmental processes. There are many cultures in the world that do not useanywhere near as much music in the early stages of a child’s life as we do inWestern society and this fact does not seem to impair their children’sdevelopment. Probably the most important role of music in these kinds of musicactivity classes is as a facilitator: music creates an environment where therules of social interactions are framed in a simple and engaging way.Music is not the only way to do this, of course, but it is often an enjoyableway. The reason it tends to be fun is that children react well to music. Thisharks back to what we discussed in Chapter 1 about their natural attractiontowards musical sounds. And a happy, engaged child makes for a happy, engagedparent, a situation which is likely to promote learning and stimulate bondingfor both.Laurel Trainor and her colleagues conducted some of the first studies tosystematically investigate the effects of active music participation classes. Intheir first study43 [part0017.html#c2fn43] they assigned six-month-old infantsto either an active musical class or a similar class where the children justlistened to music (the Baby Einstein™ CD series) and occasionally played along(the ‘passive’ group). The theory was that the active music classes featured agreater amount of social interaction and participation in music-making and thatthese two factors are beneficial for development.All the classes were weekly and one hour long. The musical teachers from eachgroup were blind to the nature of the experiment and classes took place bothwithin lower- and middle-class socioeconomic areas. After six months of classes,the children were measured on sensitivity to musical structure and expression.The active class kids showed higher levels of sensitivity to pitch and rhythmicstructure than the passive class kids, although no group differences were foundin reactions to musical expressivity.The researchers then looked at brain development using EEG (the swimming capwith the wires again). Before training, the infants from the two groups did notdiffer in their responses to piano tones, but after the six months of classes,the active group kids showed stronger and earlier responses to musical tonesthan the passive group kids.Finally, the researchers looked at social development using the Infant BehaviourQuestionnaire. Once again there were no differences before the classes startedbut after six months the active class showed less distress to novel stimuli,more smiling and laughter, and were easier to soothe than those who had takenpart in the passive group.Overall, it appears that the more active music classes helped to boost thedevelopment of many cognitive and behavioural characteristics that couldreasonably be related to the nature of the lessons. It is interesting to see,however, that not all musical skills were improved in the active class(reactions to musical expressivity). Some types of musical learning in childrenseem to carry on regardless of the type of engagement they encounter.This final important point from the music class study is one on which I wouldlike to conclude this chapter. Musical engagement in childhood exists on acontinuum: from passive listening to active engagement, informal playing andsinging through to formal music lessons and training. All of this exposure tomusic influences the way that the brain and behaviours develop, just indifferent ways and by different degrees.Musical listening is an important part of our childhood, not because it makes ussmarter, better readers or faster socialisers but because we learn about musicitself, a process known as musical enculturation.44 [part0017.html#c2fn44] Whenwe are young children we do not understand what music is all about, any morethan we understand our native language. We need to be exposed to these uniquelyhuman sounds and their structures over a period of years in order to be able tocomprehend and respond to them.It’s hard to imagine that listening to music is a complex skill but it is, inthe same way as listening to your friend talk is a skill. We don’t think ofthese things as difficult; mostly because we can’t really remember what it waslike not to be able to do them. A child, however, is learning about the natureof both of these complex sound systems (language and music) through every singleexposure. In the case of musical enculturation they are learning about the rulesof melody and rhythm construction, performance expression and style that arecommon to their musical world.music [../images/00002.jpeg]The building blocks of musical understanding, constructed quietly and behind thescenes in a child’s mind as they hear music, form the basis for theirdevelopment of individual tastes, preferences and reactions to music that willbecome very much a part of who they are as a person. Some of that person’sindividual tastes in music might come as quite a surprise to their parents whenthe child hits the next stage of their development – the adolescent years.So let’s leave childhood for now and move on to the teens and early adulthood,and talk about how the music of this unique period shapes our musical future aswell as influencing our personal and social development."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 3Music for adolescent years‘There is nothing stable in the world; uproar’s your only music’JOHN KEATSLike many people I have rather sketchy memory of what it really felt like totransition from a child to an adolescent. I don’t recall the day I certainlyleft my childhood behind but I remember the hallmarks of my adolescent life: myfirst crush on TV and in life (David Duchovny and a boy called Keith), my firstheartbreak, my first and only real argument with my loving father, my brilliantfirst car (a sixteen-year-old silver Nissan Micra that I named Ruprect1[part0017.html#c3fn1]) and my first long, lost summer.More importantly I remember the soundtrack to each of those experiences. Keithhas a song, as does Ruprect, and the boy who broke my heart. I can’t hear ‘KissMe’ by Sixpence None The Richer without being taken right back to that longfantastic summer that I spent running through the sweetsmelling yellow oilseedfields at the back of my village with one of my best friends, Owen. Ah, to befifteen again …By the time we reach our teens some of us have had musical training and somenot, but just about everyone is still learning about the world through music.Our childhood spent overhearing musical sounds has been well spent as we can noweasily listen to multilayered complex rhythmic and pitch structures with minimaleffort such that the lyrics, chords and instrumentation wash over us, stirringup the teenage whirlwind of emotions, anxiety, confusion and excitement – not tomention hormones.Music, by association and absorption, is becoming part of us. In this chapter wewill see that the music of our teenage years and early adult life comes to framea great deal of our musical future and identity in later adulthood.In this period of life we first start to regularly use music as a tonic, a kindof self-mediation. We learn about the music that makes us feel good and themusic that makes us feel terrible, and we begin to experiment with emotionsthrough music.2 [part0017.html#c3fn2] Music also mirrors and perhaps even helpsto shape the development of our personal and social identity. Through these andother processes that we will discuss in this chapter, the music of this uniquelife period becomes heavy with nostalgia and, as a consequence, is thought bymany people to be the very best music of their life.Music for moods and emotionsBefore we dive into the murky world of adolescence let’s talk briefly about howmusic is connected to our moods and emotions, as this is an important factorwhen thinking about adolescence.It will come as no surprise that mood and emotion regulation is consistentlyidentified as one of the main reasons that we listen to music: survey aftersurvey and test after test, music psychologists report on the influence thatmusic can have on our feelings of happiness, sadness, excitement, peace, and soon. One study reported that an average 64 per cent of everyday music listeningin a two-week period was associated with emotions.3 [part0017.html#c3fn3] In mylife it is more.Some of the most highly cited scholars in this area (there are many, soapologies that I can’t include everyone) include Tia DeNora,4[part0017.html#c3fn4] Alf Gabrielsson,5 [part0017.html#c3fn5] David Hargreavesand Adrian North6 [part0017.html#c3fn6] who have all collected large amounts ofdata exploring the effect of music on mood and emotion as we go about oureveryday lives as well as in our peak moments.The ultimate encyclopaedia of research into music and emotion was compiled in2010 by Patrik Juslin and John Sloboda: the Handbook of Music and Emotion:Theory, Research, Applications. This is a huge book by any standards; I do notuse the word encyclopaedia lightly. I often place this compendium on my desk ifI feel an immediate need to look scholarly. It is a super read even though it isvery dense, and much of this chapter draws inspiration from its pages.The existence of many large, well-known studies tells us that there have beendecades of research in this area carried out by some of the best in thebusiness. This gives us a rich base with which to explore the effects of musicon one of the most moody and emotional times of our lives: our teenage yearsthrough to early adulthood.At this point I should say a brief word about the difference between ‘mood’ and‘emotion’. Many of the same words can be used to describe both an emotion and amood, like ‘happy’, ‘sad’, and ‘angry’. The generally accepted difference isthat an emotion has a clear trigger, something tangible or a thought thatinduces a change in our state. Emotions also tend to be short lived. So a nicepiece of dark chocolate at the end of a long day can trigger happy emotions forme that may soon dissipate after the treat is gone. A mood, by contrast, doesnot need to have a trigger; we can all wake up in a happy mood with a bounce inour step for no particular reason. Plus a mood can last.What is emotion and why does it happen? According to the James–Lange theory,proposed way back in the 1890s, emotions are a result of the way we interpretour bodily reactions. For example, if we are surprised by a lion (hopefully nottoo common an occurrence for you) our physiology changes as a result ofchemicals triggered by our brain and released in our glands, and the subsequentreaction of our autonomic nervous system. Our pulse races, we begin to sweat andour breathing becomes shallow. This is all part of a well-tuned evolutionaryresponse to danger as our body prepares optimal conditions for ‘fight orflight’. William James and Carl Lange proposed that emotions like fear were aresult of our head trying to make sense of what was happening to our body.The James–Lange theory is convincing on first read and there is certainly acomponent of bodily reactions in our moods and emotions. It is hard to imaginebeing really frightened without the racing heart and cold sweat – suchsensations are why people go on rollercoasters and watch really scary films.However, the James–Lange theory turns out to be too simplistic in reality toexplain all emotional reactions. Not all our emotions have a bodily response andmany of them overlap (our hearts race for many reasons) but we don’t regularlyconfuse our emotions. On top of this, emotions can be experienced before theonset of a full bodily reaction.Despite these issues, aspects of the James–Lange theory are important becausethey help us understand why our teenage years are hyper-emotional, as our bodyundergoes a vast number of uncontrollable hormonal changes in a short period oftime. This fact, combined with the first exposure to so many emotionally chargedsituations (first love, leaving home, financial freedom) means things are boundto get rocky and that emotions will be all over the place at times. No wonder itis at this stage of life that we start to explore different ways to modulate,control and enhance our emotions and moods. For many people, this is the timewhen music really comes alive.There are many theories as to how music influences our emotions7[part0017.html#c3fn7] and regulates our moods: in fact, current understanding isthat there are at least six different psychological mechanisms*[part0009.html#c3st1] that are responsible for triggering emotion-like states inmusic.8 [part0017.html#c3fn8] I don’t intend to go into too much depth aboutthese debates and mechanisms (the music and emotion encyclopaedia does that farbetter than I ever could) but it is useful for us to summarise some of the maintheoretical players here:Musical mirrorPlato was perhaps the first to note that aspects of music mimic the sounds thatwe make in different emotional states. When we are happy we talk faster, in ahigher pitch and with bigger leaps in sound, whereas when we are feeling sad wetalk slower, in a lower register and with not much vocal movement. If you mapout the characteristics of happy and sad music they look very similar. PatrikJuslin and Petri Laukka9 [part0017.html#c3fn9] conducted a thorough examinationof a range of different emotions and found many similarities between the soundswe make normally with our voices and the sounds we hear in emotionally matchedmusic.ExpectationIn the 1950s the composer and author Leonard B. Meyer gave a series of lectureswhere he outlined his theory as to why music is emotional. He said that we haveexpectations as we listen to music – we expect the next note to go down or up orfor a phrase to end in certain ways. Our expectations are based on theenculturation of music that we talked about at the end of the last chapter,which happens through normal exposure to musical sound.According to Meyer, composers are aware of these expectation effects (they sensethem as well) and they both satisfy and thwart them in order to triggerdifferent emotions. This theory was later expanded by Ray Jackendoff and FredLerdahl as part of their seminal work, A Generative Theory of Tonal Music,10[part0017.html#c3fn10] and was most recently explored in the award-winning bookSweet Anticipation by David Huron.Deep brain stimulationWe must not leave the brain out of this discussion. Many of the complexappraisal reactions from recognition of emotion in music and calculations ofmusical expectations rely on the higher centres of the brain such as the frontalcortex. However, evidence from Valarie Salimpoor and Robert Zatorre suggeststhat peak emotional music, music that we associate with ‘chills’ down the spine,can also trigger responses in the much older and subconscious areas of our brainwhich are closer to the emotion centre, or amygdala, and reward systems.11[part0017.html#c3fn11] These brain responses appear to be much earlier thanthose which we could associate with a conscious evaluation, suggesting that somemusic can touch us very deeply although we do not yet fully understand why.‘Darling, they’re playing our tune’I love that this term in used in the scientific literature, firstly by JohnBooth Davies back in 1978.12 [part0017.html#c3fn12] This phrase captures thesense that music can be emotional because we attach emotion to it as it makesconnections within our life memories. This is also known as the effect ofnostalgic familiarity.These piggybacking music memory emotions can be both happy and sad, and verypowerful. I can’t listen to Ray Charles sing ‘Take These Chains From My Heart’very often – it is my heartbreak song. If you just listen to the music then itshould be a happy song as it has all the ingredients of a happy musicalstructure. But then there are the lyrics, the aching way it is sung by RayCharles and, most importantly, the image in my head of my first love walkingaway from me, as fresh and raw as if it had happened yesterday.I listened to this song many times in the days after he left, hence it became astrong part of that memory. Many years later, the visual memory of that day isnot that upsetting; the music, however, opens the floodgates.Emotional memory attachments are often formed most strongly during adolescence.Our emotions are all over the place and anything that can help settle them oreven exaggerate them in an attempt to reach a cathartic resolution is bound tohave an appeal. It is at this time that many of us come to appreciate that musicis a comparatively safe option for emotion and mood expression and regulationcompared to some of the other substances on offer. So we start to experiment andthe result is a pair bonding between us and the music that touches us.I should point out before I go any further that music is not necessarily used inthis way by all adolescents. I certainly used it this way, without understandinghow or why at the time, and I know many people who have had similar experiences.My partner on the other hand navigated his teenage tempests by getting lost inthe world of Spanish classical literature and he maintains that music was, bycomparison, not that important for his emotional development. While music is nota teenage tonic for everyone, it is enough of a universal agent to trigger asignificant scientific literature of its own, so is worth our while trying tounderstand why it is so popular and effective.Adolescent experiments with musicIt should come as no surprise that adolescents who listen to music do so for asignificant proportion of their time and consider it to be a very important partof their life. A ten year old but substantial UK survey of music listening inthis age group put the figure at between two and three hours every day13[part0017.html#c3fn13]. My guess is that this figure is much higher nowadaysthanks to a substantial increase in personal control orientated music technologyin the last decade.14 [part0017.html#c3fn14]Music listening is a popular method for emotion and mood regulation inadolescence15 [part0017.html#c3fn15] and younger people use music for thisreason more than adults.16 [part0017.html#c3fn16] In these years we are stilllearning how to regulate physical and mental state; unfortunately we have tolearn these skills quickly as developmental changes put sudden demands on us togrow up. Some studies put the age of fifteen as a turning point in the use ofcoping strategies, including music listening, to self-regulate17[part0017.html#c3fn17] – that fits in nicely with my strong personal memories ofthe song ‘Kiss Me’ during my long, lost summer.Suvi Saarikallio has devoted many years to studying music for adolescent stateregulation. Her research confirms that regular listening for mood and emotionregulation is both deliberate and unconsciously motivated, and that some of itis really quite effective.In 200718 [part0017.html#c3fn18] Saarikallio carried out a large study aimed atcategorising the psychological meaning of music for adolescents. She conducted ameta-analysis, essentially a study of lots of other studies. This type ofanalysis allows scientists to synthesise findings from different labs todetermine the consistent results, thereby locating the strongest effects.Saarikallio noted four main functions of music: identity, interpersonalrelationships, emotion and agency.Agency describes gaining a sense of control, competence and self-esteem frommusic listening. Emotion describes how young people use music to both expressand learn about emotional reactions, especially negative types, in whatSaarikallio calls a ‘safe and acceptable expression of difficult, violent, ordisapproved thoughts and feelings’. We will discuss identity and interpersonalrelationships in the next section.Saarikallio used this research to develop a scale for measuring mood regulationwith music. She tested 1,515 adolescents and found that girls use music in thisway more than boys and that older adolescents use it more than younger ones;this latter result makes sense as we tend to use strategies more as we learn andget better at using them.In addition, Saarikallio showed that greater life involvement with musicpredicts greater use of music for mood regulation but, perhaps surprisingly,this link was not limited to formal musical training; it included how importantsomeone thought music was in their life and how much they heard music in theirhome. She also found that music listening for mood regulation tends to occurmore in private than in public.Adolescents who used music successfully for music regulation tended to have awider variety of tastes – in Saarikallio’s study they were better able to choosefrom a large selection of music that they liked for just about any mood. Havingsaid this, the use of music in mood regulation was most strongly connected to apreference for rock and heavy metal music. Saarikallio suggested that the strongintensity, volume, and ‘roughness’ of these styles may reflect the emotionalexperience of youth and therefore enable better reflective coping.Music to aid copingThere are two ways in which music helps coping. The first is the behaviouralresponse. That can be anything from dancing and singing to laughing or crying(as in my Ray Charles example). Music helps with mood regulation by stimulatingphysical behaviours that have a positive effect on a person’s ability toregulate how they feel; to maintain a desired mood, make it more intense, orchange it depending on the demands of the situation.The second mechanism of music coping is cognitive, where music stimulatesthoughts and memories that help us review experiences, link the meaningstogether in our minds, and learn for future occasions.This two-part model (physical and cognitive mechanisms) gives us a framework tounderstand how music has its effect and how, in our adolescence, it becomes a‘tool’ for us to use to stimulate body and/or mind in order to get us to wherewe want to be in terms of our physical or mental state.Dave Miranda and Michel Claes19 [part0017.html#c3fn19] collected questionnairesfrom 418 French-Canadian adolescents to assess musical preferences, depressionlevels, and styles of coping by music listening (emotion oriented, problemoriented or avoidance/disengagement). They were also interested in theimportance of lyrics and peer reactions.They found that social peer groups agreed strongly on the types of music thatthey used for coping with emotions, supporting the idea that music is animportant factor in social relationships in adolescence. They also showed thatproblemoriented coping when listening to music was associated with lowerdepression levels in girls. This finding sits well with the idea proposed byAmiram Raviv and colleagues that female adolescents identify with song lyricsand artists for solace and advice about personal problems.20[part0017.html#c3fn20]By contrast, emotional coping with music was more associated with depressivesymptoms in boys. This was not a strong relationship, however, nor did itrepresent severe depressive symptoms; this may reflect a type of maladaptive‘venting’ of emotions through music that is more common in male adolescents.An important caveat with this last finding is the influence of time. Adolescentswho listen to music in order to relieve negative moods tend to feel worseinitially but then after some time has elapsed they often feel better.21[part0017.html#c3fn21] This was definitely my experience when I was trying tocure my heartbreak with Ray Charles. I felt rotten at the time but the catharsiswas an important part of the healing process. And even though the song stillmakes me cry I tend to feel better quickly as the song reminds me that I gotthrough that difficult time and everything worked out for the best.The study of French-Canadian teenagers combined with Saarikallio’s work shows usthat adolescents who are surrounded by and enjoy music use listening to copewith the stresses that they experience as they encounter personal problems andemotional challenges for the first time. Some of the music coping strategies maybe more helpful than others, especially at first, but this is all a learningexperience and must be considered in terms of long-term outcomes. Theadolescents in these studies are learning to use music to regulate their moodsand emotions in a way that many of them will go on to dip into throughout theirlives.Can some music be bad?At this point I would like to make a comment or two about the idea that music(in particular songs from certain genres) can ‘corrupt’ a young person; the ideathat music can do damage to emotional development that may lead to problemthoughts and/or behaviours.Adrian North and David Hargreaves published an excellent review of this thornyissue22 [part0017.html#c3fn22] wherein they pointed out that this idea isnothing new; in 1951 a number of radio stations banned Dean Martin’s ‘Wham! Bam!Thank You, Ma’am’ because of the apparent salacious nature of the lyrics. And aFlorida judge famously threatened to arrest Elvis Presley in 1956 if he shookhis body during his upcoming performance at a local theatre.As strange as it may seem to us now, the Florida judge was quite justified inhis desire not to offend the older audience and parents/carers, many of whomthought that Elvis’s music had a bad effect on young people. One of the quotesabout Elvis’s music at the time was made by Frank Sinatra:> It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people …> It is sung, played and written for the most part by cretinous goons and by> means of its almost imbecilic reiterations and sly, lewd – in plain fact dirty> – lyrics, and as I said before, it manages to be the martial music of every> sideburned delinquent on the face of the earth.23 [part0017.html#c3fn23]The debate about whether or not adults should protect young people from musicmodified over the years but certainly did not disappear, as many might believe,in the swinging sixties. In 1985 the US senate held a debate on the morality ofmusic, one outcome of which was the famous ‘Parental Advisory’ sticker. Amongthe first albums to feature the sticker were Soundgarden’s Louder Than Love andGuns N’ Roses’ Appetite for Destruction. The sale of a CD with this sticker to aminor in parts of the US can still result in prosecution and albums with thelabel can be banned from sale in some countries.Is there any science to support the notion that music, as well as aidingemotional and mood regulation, could in some cases be harmful to coping stylesand/or behaviours?Research has established relationships between many music genres such as rap,heavy metal – even classical and country music24 [part0017.html#c3fn24] – andproblem adolescent coping (depression, anxiety and anger) and behaviours(violence and substance abuse).25 [part0017.html#c3fn25] As such it is not wiseto brush aside the idea that some music might contribute to harm. If we want tomake the argument that music can be powerful enough to do some good then we mustaccept that in some cases it may contribute to problems.A pinch of salt is required, however, as the majority of studies in this areaare correlational in nature.26 [part0017.html#c3fn26] This means that theresearchers measure music listening and problem behaviour or coping separately,and then use statistics to look for a relationship between the two things. Now,you can get a nice significant relationship between hours of sunshine and icecream eating behaviour, but that doesn’t mean that eating ice cream makes thesun come out. What a correlation study can never establish is a direct cause.The main problem with a correlation finding is that there could be any number ofadditional factors involved in the relationship between music and problemcoping/behaviours. So, for example, one study found that adolescents who feelsadder after listening to heavy metal music have more depressive symptoms.27[part0017.html#c3fn27] This result can be accounted for by maladaptive copingbehaviours that could have developed entirely separately from the music. Theimportant caveat is that music does not necessarily cause whatever coping stylea person is using, though it can become part and parcel of the whole thing.Another issue with studies that have found an effect of music on maladaptivecoping, meaning they played music and measured how it made people feel, is thatthe majority employ music videos.28 [part0017.html#c3fn28] This is legitimateand interesting scientific investigation but I wonder why most studies in thisarea use videos and not just a CD or MP3 track. The evidence (or lack of it) inthis area seems to suggest that maladaptive responses to music are weaker in theabsence of visual images, though this is an idea that remains to be tested.Finally with regards to maladaptive responses to music, we must accept a lack ofknowledge at present on two important issues: long-term effects and placeboeffects. One series of experiments that found short-term effects of listening tomusic with violent lyrics on ratings of aggression29 [part0017.html#c3fn29]concluded that comparable direct long-term effects were unlikely; such feelingscould easily dissipate if exposure to violent lyrics was interrupted bynon-violent music or a positive event. And one study found that teenagers’impressions of the same piece of music (either ‘suicide-inducing’ or‘life-affirming’) were driven by what they were told about its meaning.30[part0017.html#c3fn30] This last finding suggests that responses to music aresometimes less about the music itself and more about how it is marketed.In conclusion, we must be careful not to label any one musical song, artist orgenre as simply ‘bad’; rather we need to look more carefully at how particularmusic, lyrics, and visual media influence young people, and at the effects ofhow the artists and their materials are presented to and interpreted by theadolescent listener.We also need to look more at the link to long-term behaviours31[part0017.html#c3fn31] and not so much at immediate reactions – many of us mightfill in a questionnaire to say that we feel temporarily more aggressive afterlistening to heavy metal but that doesn’t mean we intend to go out and indulgein violence. Future studies will hopefully narrow down any potential directnegative influence of music on behaviour, if any exists, and thereby enable usto offer more useful guidance than just a roughly drawn idea of what adultsthink is ‘safe music’.My music, my selfMusic becomes an important part of who we are and how we want other people tosee us during our adolescence. Music can provide a group identity; my brotherwas a skater boy in his teens and this defined the music that he listened to aswell as his ‘look’ (including exaggerated moptop) and aspects of his behaviouras he strived to be part of an in-group.Remember the research by Miranda and Claes, who found that the French-Canadianteenagers all tended to agree about the music that their close friends liked?And remember Saarikallio’s finding that listening to music in adolescence islinked to identity and interpersonal relationships? This is the section of thischapter where all that comes together as we explore how music becomes not only atool in our box of coping mechanisms but a part of who we are as adolescents.The concepts of self-identity and social (or group) identity are linked. It isoften by asserting our self-identity that we clarify our social identity. And wegain important components of our self-identity, such as self-esteem, throughother people’s evaluations of our social identity. While they are entwinedconcepts, music contributes selectively to self- and social identity, so we willdeal with them one at a time, starting with the self.Self-identityLearning about ourselves (what is important to us, how we think, our morals andsense of justice) is one of the most difficult but important psychologicaltransitions that we face in adolescence. Many individuals seek to understandthemselves better through their reactions to the world: what they like or don’tlike; what seems right and what seems wrong; what moves them and what leavesthem cold. The reflective nature of music explains why it is such a usefulmedium for learning about self-identity in this way. It is not strictly right orwrong in and of itself, but it can be evaluated in this way depending on eachperson.A conductor once told me that a great piece of music is like a mirror andeveryone sees themselves. We can add anything we like to music and it will stillmake sense. Music is therefore one of the greatest recipes for self-definition –just add meaning as required!Some people, like my partner, find their personal inspiration and ideals inreflective literature. Some will find them through visual arts. It is fair tosay that most of us find them through music.I will use myself as an example. As a teenager and into my twenties I spenthours listening to the music of John Lennon. His music taught me a lot about howI felt with regards to human nature and the world. I didn’t need anyone to tellme, ‘You need to listen to this music and appreciate and learn from thesentiment.’ In fact, my parents were not Beatles fans, though their taste did goto sixties music. My peers were mostly into modern music, to which I had littleaccess. I found Lennon all by myself and I loved him right from the start.He was different, and in my young eyes so was I. His journey, the things he sangabout and the way he composed music all triggered reflective thoughts in my headthat encouraged me to think about both the fun and the difficult things in life.I learned from his good and bad examples, and through his music I was able tointerpret for myself where I had come from, how I wanted to be seen by others,and where I wanted to go with my life. Of course, this was partly to do with myinterpretation of him as a person but I did not spend hours reading books abouthim or watching his films. I wanted to listen to his music.Suvi Saarikallio’s research suggests that I am not alone in my experience. Shefound that adolescents use music to promote self-exploration, to gainself-knowledge and to strengthen and reinforce their growing conception ofthemselves as people.In their book Musical Identities,32 [part0017.html#c3fn32] Raymond MacDonald,David Hargreaves and Dorothy Miell discuss the many selfidentities that canreflect and develop through music, including national identity and genderidentity. There are also self-identities that develop through musical education,such as the performer’s persona. Important concepts for young musicians includetheir self-assessed level of competency, natural ability (or perception oftalent) and degree of independence in their musical development.33[part0017.html#c3fn33]All this evidence leads to the inevitable conclusion that music is a useful andpowerful vehicle for the development of our idea of ‘self’.34[part0017.html#c3fn34] In the next section we will see how we go on to use thatmusical identity in our social environment, like a badge or cover, to quicklyindicate to other people who we are and what we are all about. Music can be amuch more effective communicator of this kind of information during adolescencethan taste in clothing, films, books or other hobbies.35 [part0017.html#c3fn35]Group identityOur private identity may be something we only ever reveal to a select few peoplein our lives; our social identity, on the other hand, is out there for all tosee. Everyday life requires us to interact with others and we develop a personathat is, to a degree, a reflection of our self-identity but can also partly bepurely for social purposes. Our adolescent years are most strongly identifiedwith the development of our social selves as we strive to be part of anin-group.Achieving a sense of belonging and support through membership of a socialin-group can not only boost our own sense of self-identity but it can facilitatean unconscious mental process by which we learn to engage in social comparisonswith other people. We define ourselves partly in response to how we seeourselves against other people and music becomes a powerful definer for manypeople in adolescence.36 [part0017.html#c3fn36]We have all heard of social in-group labels that are defined by musical genres.We have emos (emotional hardcore rock/punk), goths (gothic rock), new romantics,mods (ska, soul and R&B), rockers, beatniks, and so on. Within these socialgroups people like to assimilate the characteristics of those who share similarmusical tastes.37 [part0017.html#c3fn37]Adolescents draw on common social musical identity to create a sense of groupcohesion (peer bonding) where they view their own in-group more positivelycompared to other groups. This in turn promotes a level of optimaldistinctiveness38 [part0017.html#c3fn38] in the social world. This is animportant concept in adolescent socialisation: we seek out a position where weare not too isolated but at the same time retain a sense of selfidentity.Achieving optimal distinctiveness becomes a crucial source of positiveself-esteem.39 [part0017.html#c3fn39]This process is all part of learning how to interact with wider society,something that children are often shielded from in small families and schoolsbut a valuable skill that they must learn before heading out into the wideworld. Dolf Zillmann and Su-lin Gan40 [part0017.html#c3fn40] suggest that musiclistening and fan culture in adolescence is all part of the natural transitionfrom socialisation with parents to socialisation with peers. They agree thatsmall peer groups can gain significant gratification from belonging to a‘musical elite’.Our musical social identity not only impacts on the way we behave in the worldbut it can have an effect on the way people view us. For example, if I tell youthat a new acquaintance of mine shares your musical tastes then you aresignificantly more likely to appraise them positively and to want to becometheir friend than if they don’t share your musical tastes.41[part0017.html#c3fn41]Music can also have a positive impact on appraisals of social ‘out-groups’; inother words, it can have a pro-social effect. In one study, Spanish participantswere asked to listen to either flamenco or classical music. This was followed bya subconscious test of their attitudes towards Gypsy groups. Those who heard theflamenco music before the test showed less prejudiced attitudes towards Gypsiescompared to those who heard classical music.42 [part0017.html#c3fn42]Exploring musical identity in adolescence from both inside and outside socialgroups gives an important insight into the nature of the more subtle appraisalsthat are made in social situations and which are a feature of adult life in allcultures.In adolescence our musical taste narrows to perhaps the smallest range it willever be in our lifetime. During this period we focus on the music that speaks tous, reflects who we want to be, and through association with that music we learnabout our self-identity and how our social world works. One consequence of thisfocus is that we listen to the same sorts of music over and over again. Becauseit becomes such an integral part of our development, this music invariablybecomes ‘the best music ever made’ – in our humble opinion.The best music of my lifeIn our adolescent years we create matches between music and our formingidentities (both self and social) with the result that the music we hear at thistime eventually becomes part of us and our reflection. This process has beentermed the cohesion or crystallisation of musical tastes43[part0017.html#c3fn43] – the idea that the music we hear in our teens and earlytwenties becomes a large part of the music that we will enjoy for the rest ofour lives.But why does the music of our adolescence so often become our favourite? Wedon’t seem to have such consistent, strong associations with the food we tastedin young adulthood, the clothes we wore or the places where we lived.Frozen in timeThe first reason is that while all those other things can change (quality ofingredients, fabrics, and buildings) music stays exactly the same, frozen intime. Otis Redding, Amy Winehouse, Johnny Cash, Luciano Pavarotti, and EllaFitzgerald may all have left this earth but at the flick of the switch I canhear their voices as if they were recorded yesterday. Music is so effectivelyfrozen in time that it makes a perfect stimulant for mental time travel.When I say mental time travel I don’t necessarily mean to say that we journey toa specific point in time. Hearing a favourite piece of music from our youth cantransport you to a certain time and place but it can also simply take you backto a time period. This is often the case with our favourite songs, when we haveheard them so often that they are not really attached to a specific event.Rather these pieces represent a symbolic concatenation of the youth experience –‘this song reminds me of what it was like to be 21’.Our minds are capable of specific time travel as well, thanks to a special formof memory known as episodic auto-biographical memory (the ‘self-memory’ system),which is your memory for your life episodes (more on this in Chapter 7). Veryoften our memories can become foggy and need a jump-start to trigger therecollection of a particular event. Music is a great cue as it is reliable overtime and personal to us. This means we end up using it more as a mentaltime-travel device than other things in life, such as food or locations, andbecause of this regular use, music is more likely to end up tied to our best andworst times from growing up and by association becomes part of our favouritemusic.Emotional joltThe second reason why we become so attached to the music of our youth is theemotional ingredient, which again is hard to recreate with a good sandwich or apretty park. Our adolescent experiments with music, mood and emotion stand us ingood stead for the emotional journeys we will go on as adults but they also laydown deep markers that stay within us.Most of the really strong emotional experiences that we have with music occur inour adolescence.44 [part0017.html#c3fn44] The music that is most effective intouching us emotionally in this way is very often the music that will touch usfor the rest of our days because it becomes so psychologically and physicallysignificant in our life story.45 [part0017.html#c3fn45]Unique brain signatureBoth the strong link to memory and the special ingredient of emotion mean thatour brain reacts differently when it hears our favourite life music compared towhen it hears music that is not in our personal hit parade. We talked at thestart of this chapter (see page 58) about how music that gives us a physicalsensation of chills can stimulate deep areas in the brain associated withemotion and reward. But this is not the only brain area to react to our topmemory tunes.46 [part0017.html#c3fn46]Petr Janata studies the brain signatures of music-evoked life memories. Hebelieves that this type of memory is unique and may hold promise as a way tostimulate memory in medical conditions such as dementia (see Chapter 8).In 2007 Janata and his colleagues tested the musical memories of 329 students intheir early twenties at the University of California, Davis.47[part0017.html#c3fn47] His team downloaded 1,515 different songs from the Top100 pop and R&B lists and trimmed them to 30-second samples. Each participantheard a selection of songs that were in the charts when they were aged betweenseven and nineteen years old. The students were asked if they had any personalmemory recollection in response to each song clip.Janata found that a life memory was associated with at least one of the musicclips in 96 per cent of cases. Most of the songs triggered memories from thelast five years for the students, putting those memories in early adolescence asopposed to childhood. The most common memories were of friends (47 per cent ofsongs) and partners (28 per cent of songs), and in around 50 per cent of casesthe participants provided detailed descriptions of the memory, proving just howvivid they were.Importantly, the emotional rating given to the musicevoked memories weresignificantly higher than neutral and the most common emotion words selectedwere ‘happy’, ‘youthful’ and ‘nostalgic’. This preliminary study confirms justhow intricately music gets knitted into emotional memories of our adolescentlife.In a follow-up, Janata used this kind of music to trigger life memories ofthirteen adolescents (average age of twenty) in an fMRI scanner, which measuresbrain activity by analysing the way that the brain uses oxygen in the blood.48[part0017.html#c3fn48] In response to musically related life memories he foundunique activations in a distributed network of brain areas including the medialprefrontal cortex (MPFC). This part of the brain is located in the middle of thehead, just behind the frontal cortex (the bit of the brain encased by theforehead – see diagram on page 83). These MPFC activations were stronger inresponse to the most salient and favourite adolescent life memories.Janata concluded that this brain network is involved in music life memoriesbecause so many different memory systems (emotion, knowledge, recollection,etc.) are triggered by hearing the music and all fire together in order to makea stronger and more vivid memory for the person. That brain activation signatureis unlikely to be unique to adolescence but the research we have seen in thischapter suggests that the types of music that trigger this brain response aremore than likely going to be those that we heard during that period.All this evidence suggests that we enjoy the music of our adolescence in aspecial way, in a way that no other music we will ever hear in our lives willinspire. During these years our mind and body face a unique set of stressors(hormones, personal and social challenges, rapid physical growth) that mean theway we take in music, weave it around our memories and sense of self, and thefrequency with which we recall it for the rest of our days, will always givethat music a special place in our hearts … and in our brain.music [../images/00002.jpeg]Ask yourself, what are my top five favourite songs or pieces of music? I wouldbet good money that most of what you come up with will be the music that youwere listening to in your adolescence. Out of my top five, four songs are fromthat period49 [part0017.html#c3fn49] and I know that all six of my dad’s (yes, Iasked him for a top five and he gave me six)50 [part0017.html#c3fn50] are fromthat time. Two of mine are connected to specific people or events from that timeperiod while the rest, and all of my dad’s, are simply the soundtracks of ouryouth.This chapter has thrown some scientific light on why this brief but uniqueperiod of life can be so very important to the growth of our musical ideals andtastes, and how through emotional support, memory prompts, self assurance andsocial facilitation the music of this period becomes an integral part of ourlives. This is no doubt why we choose to take it with us as we journey on to thenext life period – adulthood.* [part0009.html#c3s1] Brainstem reflexes, conditioning, emotional contagion,expectancy, memory and visual imagery."},{"pageContent":"PART IIMusic in adult life"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 4The musical adult‘Most people live and die with their music still unplayed. They never dare totry.’MARY KAY ASHThe next three chapters of the book explore the role of music in adult life.Wherever we go and whatever we do with our adult life, music will be thereplaying an often subtle but important role, whether we choose to play it or not.We will explore how this blanket of music impacts on our working life and ourreactions to the commercial world (Chapter 5) as well as our hobbies, pastimes,and romantic life (Chapter 6). These two chapters will show how music can changethe way we feel about, react to and interpret the world around us.First I will lay the groundwork for an exploration of musical adulthood bytaking a look at the full spectrum of adult musical ability from high expertisethrough to those individuals who live with a specific music learning difficulty,and finally the majority of us, who would not think of ourselves as ‘experts’but who enjoy music and who are, in fact, incredibly musical.We will explore the relationship between normal music exposure and subsequentlearning (including after lessons) and brain/behaviour development. In reviewingthe full spectrum of the adult musical brain we will see that music learningdoes not stop once we reach adulthood; it goes on and can be boosted for as longas we live, whether you are a famous concert pianist, an enthusiastic musiclistener, a new learner, or simply an occasional radio surfer. This chapter willreveal the musical adult in all its variety.Music changes the brainAt the time of writing I teach at a university in London on a course thatexplores ‘Music, Mind and the Brain’. Of all the lectures I give, the mosteagerly anticipated is about how musical training may change the brain – I thinkthat this particular lecture is so popular because many of my students aremusicians and they want to hear all about their special brains!You might fall into that category too, and if so then you are about to hear allabout the kind of changes that may have happened to your brain as a result ofyour hours of hard work. Even if you are not a musician, the story of howmusicianship realtes to the brain is still fascinating because it is symptomaticof a remarkable faculty that we all share: our brain’s ability to change, growand heal throughout our lives.Plasticity is one of the best tricks that our brain possesses; the ability toreorganise pathways and synapses in response to environmental pressures andbiological needs. This ability explains how we survived as a species for solong, as brain plasticity is essential for learning from experience and forrecovery from brain illness and injury.We do not yet know exactly how brain plasticity occurs: it could be that neuronsget bigger, synapses get denser, cell support structures grow, cells die moreslowly than usual, nerve conduction speeds increase, and so on and so forth.1[part0017.html#c4fn1] Any or all of these mechanisms could be behind eachexample of brain plasticity. What matters is that the brain is incrediblyflexible and continues to develop all the time.We have a critical period of maximal brain plasticity when we are young, wherewe learn the most we will ever learn in such a small period of time. We nowknow, however, that the idea that our minds become rigid and set in stone afterthis point is simply untrue; your brain remains plastic for your entire life.That means that we are never too old to learn and for the brain to change – andlearning to play an instrument or sing is a powerful way to stimulate the mind.We can pick up just about any skill as an adult, and in doing so we can mouldour brains. One of the most famous studies in this area was a study of Londontaxi drivers2 [part0017.html#c4fn2] which found that drivers who had a greaterknowledge of London streets had a larger hippocampus; this part of the brain isassociated with important functions for a London cabbie, such as memory,navigation and spatial awareness.Even more convincing for the idea that adult learning influences brain structureare studies that teach adults a new skill from scratch and then watch to see ifthe brain changes over time and with practice. How about juggling? A study thatscanned people’s brains before and after just seven days of learning a newjuggling trick found an increase in the density of a visual motor area of thebrain.3 [part0017.html#c4fn3]How much can music change the way that your brain looks and works? There islittle evidence so far that just listening to lots of music causes anysignificant changes to brain structure or function. By contrast, there is a longhistory of exploring the changes that may occur as a result of musical training.In Chapter 2 we looked at how after only a short period of music training achild’s brain starts to re-shape itself in response to its new musical input andskills.4 [part0017.html#c4fn4] In this chapter we will first look at the endresult of all this practice – the brains of adult musicians – and see where andhow they are different.After looking at the brains of musicians we will explore how typical musicalbrain development can go awry, in a special population of adults who appear tobe born ‘tone deaf’. Hearing more about these people and their experiences willhelp set the musical skills that the rest of us have as adults, and may take forgranted, into true perspective. Finally, we will look at the evidence that justabout all of us can potentially change our brains by taking up music, at anyage.Music learning and the brainIn the 19th century, scientists began to accept the notion that the primarycauses of human behaviour lay in the brain. Previous to this, the soul and theheart were popular candidates. Towards the end of the 19th century, scientificinterest arose in studying the brains of eminent people in order to determinewhat might have caused their abilities and expertise. Post-mortem brains ofchoice included those of mathematicians, poets and, of course, musicians.Sigmund Auerbach (1860–1923) was a German surgeon who was fascinated by thestructure of the brain. In his lifetime he contributed a great many works on thetreatment of brain tumours, nerve damage and epilepsy. In the early 20th centuryhe conducted a series of post-mortem brain dissections on five famous musiciansof the time: the conductors Felix Mottl and Hans von Bülow, music teacher NaretKoning, the singer Julius Stockhausen and the cellist Bernhard Cossmann. DrAuerbach wanted to see where and how their brains were different to the averageone that he saw every day on his operating table.Auerbach concluded that all five individuals had enlargements in the middle andback areas of the superior temporal gyrus. Let’s break down that brain name. Thebrain is covered in folds of grey matter and a ‘gyrus’ is the upper part of afold or bulge, as opposed to the crevice or gap (known as a ‘sulcus’). Thetemporal lobe is behind your ears (on both sides) and is primarily interested inprocessing sound. ‘Superior’ means upper part (as opposed to ‘inferior’ whichwould be the lower part). So to recap, the superior temporal gyrus is a bulge ingrey matter that lies in the upper part of the temporal lobe. In the five deadmusicians Auerbach found a much bigger bulge than he was used to seeing.images [../images/00003.jpeg]A representation of the human brain, showing the location of the superiortemporal gyrus and selected other structures.He also noted other differences that happened in some individuals but notothers, such as increases in grey matter in the posterior (back) part of thefrontal lobe (behind your forehead). All in all, the brain differences he sawwere not extensive, but remember we are talking about things that could be seenwith the human eye and a magnifying glass.Later studies backed up Auerbach’s findings, including a study by DorothéeBeheim-Schwarzbach in 1974 on the postmortem brains of three musically talentedindividuals in the famous Vogt archives, a collection of brains amassed by theGerman neurologist Oskar Vogt, his wife Cécile, and their co-workers between1928 and 1953.Fortunately, the development of brain imaging techniques such as magneticresonance imaging (MRI) in the 20th century made it possible to obtainthree-dimensional, high-resolution images of the living brain instead of havingto wait around for famous musicians to pass away. This development also meant wecould look for the first time at more than just a handful of brains at once,allowing the use of statistical approaches to help objectively quantifydifferences in brain structure between experts and non-experts. Finally, as withthe jugglers, these types of study make it easier to determine whether theunique anatomical features that we see in musicians’ brains are the result,rather than the cause, of skill acquisition.In this next section we’ll look at a number of the differences that have beenfound in musicians’ brains when compared to those of non-musicians. Excellentextensive reviews on this subject are available in the scientific literature;5[part0017.html#c4fn5] here I pick out some of the largest and most consistentfindings.Two short but important points before we dive in. First, there is no consistentdefinition of a ‘musician’ in the literature – different studies tend to includepeople with different amounts of training and experience so there is no magiclevel that must be reached in order to be labelled as a musician. Typically,however, we are talking about people who have at least ten years’ training andwho are still actively playing on a regular basis.The second point is that in most cases we can’t say for sure whether musicaltraining caused the changes that we see. It may be that any brain differencesexisted or were preprogrammed before the person started their training and thiswas one of the reasons that they went on to be a good musician.The only long-term study at the time of writing that has scanned the brains ofchildren before and after they started music lessons found evidence that thebrain changes observed were not there at the start but instead were happening asa result of the training.6 [part0017.html#c4fn6] But the jury is still out onthis issue so remember to take the following results with a pinch of salt –music may cause these brain differences in musicians, bring them out, or be areaction to them. Whatever the truth, we can be sure that music training isinvolved.Brain structureThe brain has two hemispheres that are held together by a series of neural fibreconnections in a structure called the corpus callosum. We need to be able totransmit information between the hemispheres quickly and effectively in order tocoordinate activity in the left and right sides of the brain, includingmovements from the left and right sides of our bodies. The corpus callosumfacilitates this connectivity.One of the earliest (1995) brain imaging studies of musicians and non-musiciansused in-vivo magnetic resonance morphometry. This method allows scientists tomap the surface area of the corpus callosum using images from an MRI scanner.Gottfried Schlaug and colleagues7 [part0017.html#c4fn7] reported that the corpuscallosum was significantly larger in 30 professional, right-handed keyboard andstring musicians compared to 30 non-musically trained individuals that werematched for age and gender. Moreover, the difference was driven mostly by peoplewho started their musical training before age seven. The conclusion was that theneed for complex bimanual coordination when playing keyboard or stringinstruments necessitates growth in the brain area that facilitates communicationbetween the hands.Not only is the corpus callosum bigger in some professional musicians, it alsohas a different way of working. You get faster transfer of all kinds ofinformation (including visual) between the hemispheres in musicians compared tonon-musicians.8 [part0017.html#c4fn8]As well as facilitating information transfer between the hemispheres, the corpuscallosum has to maintain a certain level of inhibition or blocking. It is adelicate balance: too much information crosses the hemispheres and the messagesfrom each side may get confused; too little and there is less effectivecoordination.You might predict that musicians would have more corpus callosum inhibitionbecause of the increased information from the two hands and the need to maintainindependent control of movement. In fact, the inhibitory circuits in musicianshave been shown to be less effective in this brain area, meaning that there isless blocking of signal transfer.9 [part0017.html#c4fn9] One theory to explainthis situation is that professional pianists in particular have gained such highlevels of independence between the messages from the two hands that they canafford to let down the floodgates and share information freely between the sidesof the brain without fear of confusion and breakdown in performance.The corpus callosum is not the only point of connectivity in the brain. Thewhole structure is covered in white matter pathways whose job it is to transfersignals between different parts of the brain. There is evidence that musicaltraining has an impact on the structural integrity of some of these white matterpathways, perhaps making them stronger.10 [part0017.html#c4fn10]A large study of professional pianists carried out at University College Londonfound several areas of the brain where white matter fibres were denser (agreater number of them, better aligned and with more effective myelination*[part0011.html#c4st1]) and moreover this finding was associated with practice;the more someone practised, the denser the white matter. This finding hints atimproved connectivity in a number of important brain regions outside the corpuscallosum in musicians.The enhanced connectivity effect is not limited to instrumental learning either.A study conducted by Gus Halwani and colleagues11 [part0017.html#c4fn11] testedthe integrity of a particularly large white matter pathway (or ‘tract’) known asthe arcuate fasciculus (AF). The AF connects the temporal and frontal lobes andis a very important pathway for carrying information about sound. We have two AFtracts, one in the right hemisphere and one in the left. Picture this structureas being like a hollow tube filled with rice noodles, which represent theflexible individual fibres within the tract.Halwani and his team used a technique called tractography to measure the volume(the size of the tube) and the density of the fibres (noodles) in the AF tractsin both hemispheres in non-musicians, instrumental musicians and vocalmusicians. The AF tract was larger and denser in musicians compared tonon-musicians. Interestingly, in the left hemisphere, parts of the AF werebigger in singers compared to instrumentalists but were also less dense, meaningthe fibres in the AF at these points were likely to be more criss-crossed orbranching.Why the difference in the left and right AF in the singers? One theory is thatthe right AF is more involved in understanding the relationship between soundand how we produce it, through our hands, feet or voices. In contrast, the leftAF may be more responsive to how we use our vocal system to produce minutedifferences in sound. So the left side of the brain may be more focused on thedemands of producing speech while the right side is more interested in all typesof sound more generally.The great point about this study is that it hints that you may get a boosteffect in brain connectivity from singing, which is something that we can allattempt in our everyday lives without the need for an instrument. Of course, wenow need research to establish whether this effect occurs in people who are newto musical training or if it is limited to highly trained musicians.MovementIf you play a musical instrument or sing then you need to develop complex anddelicate motor control skills for optimal performance. The motor feats thattop-level musicians can achieve are quite staggering. The best professionalpianists can produce up to 1,800 notes per minute while compensating for tinychanges in volume and pressure, an amazing achievement for the fingers.12[part0017.html#c4fn12] The presence of such incredible motor ability hasconsequences for the structure of the brain.People who have developed advanced motor skills for musical performance tend tohave measurable differences in the part of the brain that represents the bodyand its movement. This area sits roughly on the crown of the head, going downtowards the brainstem, and comprises the somatosensory cortex and motor cortex.These two structures sit alongside each other and work together very closely.The motor cortex is in charge of planning and making movements while thesomatosensory cortex responds to information about our sensations of touch,including pain, as well as proprioception – our conception of where our body islocated in space.The somatosensory and motor cortices feature a logical, elongated map of thebody. This map represents each part of the body to a different degree dependingon the importance of fine control and regular use. Your body map would lookstrange if you were to see it represented visually, an image that has becomeknown as the ‘cortical homunculus’ (see opposite); imagine a person with massivehands, feet, lips, and tongue but a tiny stomach, back, ears and neck.The brain body map is not the same for everyone of course, as we use our bodiesin different ways, and shifts in the map can occur during one person’s lifetimein response to stroke or injury (to either the brain or body). Despite thisvariety, we can still see general differences between the brain body maps ofmusicians and non-musicians.Keyboard musicians show increased tactile sensitivity in their hands13[part0017.html#c4fn13] and perform better on tasks that require motor learning,especially when they have begun musical training early in life.14[part0017.html#c4fn14] These traits are backed up by corresponding differencesin their brain body map.images [../images/00004.jpeg]The cortical homunculus: a visual image that depicts the extent to whichdifferent body areas are represented in the motor and somatosensory cortices ofthe human brain.images [../images/00005.jpeg]The relative location of different body area representations along the motor andsomatosensory cortices.Katrin Amunts and colleagues15 [part0017.html#c4fn15] used MRI to measure a partof the motor cortex where the hands are represented. The researchers found thatnon-musicians had a more asymmetrical structure, larger on the left compared tothe right. This is the expected brain balance for right-handed people since thebrain’s representation of our body is crossed over (your right hand on the leftside of the brain and vice versa). Keyboard players, by comparison, had a muchmore symmetrical structure, reflecting a much larger representation of bothhands in the brain. This was especially true of people who had started theirmusical lessons early in life.More recent studies have also found a more pronounced omega (‘W’ shaped) patternin the motor cortex of musicians16 [part0017.html#c4fn16]. Amazingly, theeffects in that study were identified just by looking at the brain with thenaked eye – the differences are that clear to see.Scientists have also looked at responses in the brain’s body map. Christo Pantevand colleagues17 [part0017.html#c4fn17] studied string players who had all beguntheir musical training at a young age and who were still practising regularlyand compared them to a group of control participants who did not play aninstrument or carry out other rhythmic activity with their fingers such astyping. The researchers stimulated the participants’ thumb and little fingers onboth hands with a little harmless, painless pressure. They then measured thecortical response in the somatosenory areas using a magnetoencephalography (MEG)scanner, a sensitive piece of equipment that measures brain activity byrecording the magnetic fields around the head that occur in response toelectrical currents.Pantev and his colleagues found larger brain responses in musicians compared tothe non-musicians but only in the left hand, indicating that the representationof movement in the fingers was larger in the musicians’ brains. The fact thatthis effect was larger in the left hand was probably driven by the large numberof violin players in the study, who use their left hand for much finer movementsthan their right (bow) hand.18 [part0017.html#c4fn18]These studies tell us that musicians’ skills in fine motor control haveconsequences for the way that they perform on non-musical motor tasks in thelab, and that this difference shows up in the structure and activity of thebrain body map that in some places you can actually see with the naked eye.Listening skillsIn the previous chapter on music in childhood we saw that one of the firstchanges to the brain that occurs following music lessons is a boost in hearingskills – you may recall the phrase ‘music for a smarter ear’. By adulthood wecan clearly see the anatomical and functional differences in the brains ofmusicians who by the stage of adulthood are masters at perceiving and respondingto small changes in sound, especially on their instrument/voice.Activation levels in the primary auditory cortices of professional musicians inresponse to musical sound have been found to be 102 per cent larger than innon-musicians only 30 milliseconds after the onset of a tone. Furthermore, greymatter in parts of auditory cortex has been found to be 130 per cent larger.19[part0017.html#c4fn19] Musicians also show enhanced perception of small music-and speech-like changes.20 [part0017.html#c4fn20] It is fair to say thatmusicians’ brains are big, quick and powerful when it comes to analysing sounds.One important point about musical experience is that it is not simply a ‘volumeknob effect’21 [part0017.html#c4fn21] where everything gets better. Neuralresponses to sound are balanced to leave more resources available for processingcomplex aspects of sound, which professional musicians can do better. The boostthat occurs in auditory processing in musicians is in that sense an optimisingprocess.One of the consequences of this optimisation process is that you see the biggestboosts in processing familiar sounds – a musician’s own instrument or voice – ascompared to other sounds. Christo Pantev and his team demonstrated thatmusicians get an increased brain response (25 per cent larger) in the firstmilliseconds after hearing a musical tone.22 [part0017.html#c4fn22] No suchboost occurred when musicians heard ‘pure tones’, artificial pitch sounds that atraditional instrument would never produce. (These tones are composed of all thebasic elements of a sound wave – frequency, wave length and amplitude – so wehear pitch but without any of the overtones that arise from natural vibration ofair caused by a piano string or a clarinet reed.)In a second study Pantev compared the brain responses of violin and trumpetplayers to violin and trumpet tones.23 [part0017.html#c4fn23] The researchersmeasured the strength of the cortical response to the tones and found a clearpattern – a bigger boost for the more familiar instrument in both groups.Most recently, Dana Strait and colleagues have demonstrated a similar pattern ofresults when looking at very early brainstem responses.24 [part0017.html#c4fn24]When exposed to sounds, the brainstem emits a wave signal in response, as aresult of the electrical activity in the brain, which is called an auditoryevoked potential. Think of it as being like the echo of your voice when youshout into a cave. The brainstem response can be measured to determine theextent to which it is similar to the original sound, in the same way that youcould record an echo and compare it to your original shout.Strait and her colleagues recorded auditory brainstem responses in pianists andnon-pianists (all accomplished adult musicians) as they listened to threedifferent musical sounds: 200 milliseconds of piano, bassoon or tuba. Thepianists’ auditory brainstem response to piano sound more closely resembled thecharacteristics of the sound wave compared to the brain responses of othermusicians. In essence, the pianist’s brains produced a more accurate lookingbrain ‘echo’ of their own instrument. In the paper the authors refer to thiseffect succinctly as the production of a more accurate ‘neural snapshot’ ofpiano sound in pianists.All these findings suggest that the brain tunes its auditory system to a finelevel, giving the musician a natural advantage when it comes to listening tomusic by their own instrument or voice. This likely occurs as a result of thestimulation of feedback and feedforward pathways in the brain as a musicianstrives to learn from their own sound and push the fine-tuning of their ownperformance for maximum effect.This apparent blessing can also be a curse, however, as it puts trainedmusicians at a disadvantage if they are listening to their own instrument whenit is slightly out of key. I have personal experience of this phenomenon, asvery slight mis-tunings of the guitar used to drive me mad when I was judgingcompetitions. This baffled me at the time as I knew that I was nowhere near assensitive to the sound of other instruments, even though I was an avid musiclistener. Now I know why!The enhancement in hearing skills that we see in musicians can get quitespecific but you can also see general effects. One such effect is the processingof pitch in speech. Patrick Wong used the auditory brainstem recording techniqueto look at responses to Mandarin Chinese tones in musicians and non-musicians.25[part0017.html#c4fn25] He found improved pitch tracking within the brainresponse in musicians who did not speak Chinese, even though they were listeningto linguistic tones as opposed to musical ones. The musicians’ tracking of thelinguistic pitch was more robust and faithful. This finding may explain in partwhy musicians are often better at learning to speak a second language.26[part0017.html#c4fn26]Speech perception in our native language is a skill that we have already seen tobe enhanced in children who take music lessons compared to children who do not.In adults this relationship remains strong, and furthermore the amount ofpractice predicts the extent of the improvement in hearing speech in noise.27[part0017.html#c4fn27] Adult musicians also show more finely tuned subcorticalbrain responses and improved discrimination ability when it comes todistinguishing similar speech syllables (such as ‘ba’ and ‘da’).28[part0017.html#c4fn28] So if you need to follow a conversation at a noisy partythen try calling on a musician in case you miss any words.Finally, it appears that these differences in the early brain responses of adultmusicians to speech sounds may also benefit them in later life, when the abilityto track fast-changing speech often declines naturally. Evidence suggests thatolder people (average age 65) who have had a moderate amount (between four andfourteen years) of musical training early in life but who have not played fordecades still have faster neural responses to speech sounds compared to matchedindividuals who had little or no musical training.29 [part0017.html#c4fn29] Itmay be that early musical training sharpens our sound systems in a lifelongmanner.Motor responseAnother interesting brain hearing effect that you can see in adult musicians issomething that I like to call ‘brain ghosting’ in my classes. When musicianshear a piece of music that they know how to play or sing, their brain showssimilar patterns of motor activation compared to that which we would see if theywere actually playing or singing. Even when they are lying absolutely stonestill in the scanner, their brain is ‘ghosting’ the music performance.30[part0017.html#c4fn30]This ghosting effect is recognised by musicians, who often report that theyexperience an automatic coupling between musical sounds and their associatedmotor actions. One interesting anecdote I heard in relation to this effect wasthat singers are often advised not to listen to recordings of music immediatelybefore a performance. Even though they would not be singing out loud the fear isthat they may strain the voice through automatic triggering of the brain’s musicmotor ghosting system. Whether or not this could actually happen is not known,but this account suggests that the power of the brain’s musical ghosting systemis recognised by professional musicians.Memory and visionSome musicians show advantages in mental abilities that have no clear brainbasis or at least not one that we can currently narrow down to a single area orresponse. These types of ability are still worth a mention. They are most likelyto be due to the combined effects of many of the areas that we have mentioned inprevious sections or they could be caused by things we can’t easily ‘see’ goingon in the brain, like more effective use of cognitive strategies.The primary mental skill of interest, and one I am particularly fascinated by,is memory. Unlike in taxi drivers, we don’t see in musicians a big boost in themain memory brain area, the hippocampus. Despite this, there is little doubtthat musicians have better memories in a variety of areas.31[part0017.html#c4fn31] Obviously a musician will do better with a test ofmusical memory as they have more strategies to be able to remember the sounds:they can picture notes in their head or form a motor memory of what it feelslike to play those notes. How about other types of everyday memory task?One of the first large-scale studies of multiple memory tests across differentdomains (musical, verbal, visual) was conducted by two of my students StefaniaPileri and Cristina Di Bernardo. They tested matched groups of musicians andnon-musicians on eight different memory tests and found that the musicians hadenhanced verbal working memory, where you have to keep more than one thing inyour mind at once. They did not find any boost to short-term speech memory(trying to keep a telephone number in mind for a few seconds), or visual orspatial memory.This study shows clearly that musicians do not demonstrate a general memoryenhancement from their training in the same way as working a muscle in the gymwill make it bigger. Rather than simply gaining more ‘capacity’ in memory, myhunch is that musicians get better at using their memory, and this is especiallymarked when it comes to recalling and manipulating sounds, whether they aremusical or not.While we don’t tend to see any effects of musicianship in memory for visualthings (other than visual music), we do see some differences in musicians whenit comes to visuo-motor skills: the types of skills where you need toco-ordinate your visual and motor systems in order to carry out an action. Thisis probably due to the fact that musicians who can read music spend so much oftheir time learning to associate a visual symbol (notes) with a motor response(playing or singing). This process likely sharpens up the systems that allow usto associate visual and motor representations.32 [part0017.html#c4fn32] Theinteresting next step will be to work out how wide-ranging this enhancementreally is and whether it can help with other, more everyday skills that requirevisuo-motor skills such as driving or sports that require hand-eye coordination.Over the years, many experiments have compared musicians and non-musicians in avariety of situations. In this last section I have outlined some of the mostwell-known areas of behaviour and ability that show promise for the future. Whatwe need now are more studies that explore exactly why musicians perform betterin these areas so we can understand better how musical training affects both thebrain and behaviour in positive ways and the implications for future learning.33[part0017.html#c4fn33] So far we have managed to demonstrate that music makingover a lifetime impacts on our minds – how exactly this happens is a mystery forthe future.A music processing disorderNow that I have outlined some of the differences you can see when comparingmusicians and non-musicians, in both brain and behaviour, I am going to go rightto the other end of the spectrum to think about people who struggle with musicalsounds.The aim of this section is to bring us all (especially the musicians) back downto earth and the reality that we are all musical. We are brought up with astereotypical idea of ‘musicians’ and ‘musicality’ in Western society, one thatreally means ‘expert’. Experts exist in all walks of life, but that does notalter the fact that we are all incredibly musical. I hope to convince you thatthe musical skills we possess as adults are, in fact, remarkable. One of thebest ways that I can make my case is by putting those musical skills into sharprelief by looking at what happens when they don’t develop in the typical way, asis the case in amusia.The small population of individuals who have amusia experience genuine andspecific music processing difficulties in the absence of a hearing problem orany other notable cognitive, emotional or social impairment.34[part0017.html#c4fn34] I have been lucky enough to study this rare condition forfive years and I am going tell you about what it is like to live withouteffortless human music processing abilities.The way you sing off-keyAmusia is often referred to as ‘tone deafness’, but let’s be clear. We all knowof a friend, colleague or family member who couldn’t carry a tune in a bucket,whose singing causes genuine alarm, and who should be kept away from karaokemachines under public health legislation. The majority of these individuals donot have amusia. Most are just poor singers.The best illustration of this point came from a study by Lola Cuddy.35[part0017.html#c4fn35] She and her team went into Queen’s University in Canadaand asked how many of the students thought they were ‘tone deaf’ – around 17 percent of just over 2000 people put their hands up. The researchers then tested200 of these students for amusia (see below for how this is done). Only ahandful of the apparently ‘tone deaf’ people had a genuine music processingdifficulty. The vast majority who believed they were ‘tone deaf’ actually had afine ear for music; most were just not that interested in music and felt thatthey could not sing well.Nearly every self-confessed ‘tone deaf’ person that I know is haunted by theidea that they can’t sing36 [part0017.html#c4fn36] – usually based on the harshjudgement of a schoolteacher, a choir leader or even close friends andrelatives. Karen Wise and John Sloboda37 [part0017.html#c4fn37] studiedself-confessed ‘tone deaf’ adults in the UK and found that while they did havesome trouble singing, their biggest problem was that they were under-confident.They sang better with accompaniment, leading the authors to suggest that theirdifficulty was not insurmountable. They and most of the ‘tone deaf’ people youknow would respond well to a few singing lessons. Singing training in amusics,by contrast, has led to comparatively fewer improvements and in most cases ofsevere amusia such training has little effect on the underlying music processingdifficulty.38 [part0017.html#c4fn38]In general, if a person says ‘I sound terrible when I sing’ then they areunlikely to be tone deaf, as in order to make this judgment a person must beable to recognise the mistakes they are making. An individual with amusia ismore likely to say ‘My family and friends think I am a terrible singer, but I’mnot really sure either way’.Manifestations of amusiaIt should be no surprise by now that musical understanding can break down inmany different ways because so much of the brain is involved in processingmusic. Some people with amusia struggle with a sense of pitch and how it moves,a crucial skill for tracking how a melody unfolds over time. One of the maindifficulties I see in amusics is a problem with the concepts of ‘up’ and ‘down’in pitch.39 [part0017.html#c4fn39] Most of us take that skill completely forgranted and can recognise if a sound is rising or falling without thinking, butthis can be difficult for someone with amusia.Other people with amusia may encounter difficulties with the quality of musicalsounds, if their perception of timbre is impaired. Timbre is the quality of asound that means we can tell whether a note is played on a flute or a cello, forexample.A classic case of a timbre problem was the man who went to his doctor with aunique complaint – Madonna was sounding funny all of a sudden. This man was abig Madonna fan but lately he had noticed that her voice was breaking up. Herealised that there may be a problem with him (and not Madonna) when he noticedthe same new tinny sounds when listening to her old records. This was not anobvious symptom of a medical difficulty to most, but it turned out that the manhad suffered a very small stroke that had left him with a mild case of amusia.DiagnosisAmusia is currently assessed and diagnosed using the Montreal Battery for theEvaluation of Amusia, a test developed by Isabelle Peretz and her colleagues.40[part0017.html#c4fn40] During the test, a person listens to two short melodiesand must say whether they think they are the same or different. For peoplewithout amusia, the occasional ‘different’ note in this test is pretty easy tospot. In fact, most of them stick out like a sore thumb. It is quite amazing tosit next to an intelligent person who listens to tunes with an obviousout-of-key note and says ‘same’. But these people with amusia are absolutelygenuine – they simply can’t consciously recognise that the bad note does notbelong; that it is not ‘right’.Amusia in the absence of a hearing problem can be either congenital or acquired:congenital means that an individual was probably born with the predispositionfor their condition and it developed as they aged despite normal exposure tomusic. We can’t say for sure that anyone is born amusic, as you can’t measurefor lack of a skill (music processing) that has not yet had the chance to fullydevelop. There are, however, a few documented cases of amusia in childhood,which suggests that the condition can develop early in life.41[part0017.html#c4fn41]Current estimates are that around 4 per cent of the population may havecongenital amusia42 [part0017.html#c4fn42] though it is possible that thisfigure is an overestimate.43 [part0017.html#c4fn43] Acquired amusia, on theother hand, is the term given when an individual who has had no previousproblems with music suddenly exhibits music processing difficulties, usuallyfollowing a head injury, stroke or a coma.Amusia is often defined as the inability to comprehend or respond to music;however, this is a misleading label. Individuals with amusia are capable ofmusic appreciation. My much-missed colleague Diana Omigie44[part0017.html#c4fn44] studied the types of music that individuals withcongential amusia listen to in their everyday lives. She asked them to completediary entries about their musical surroundings several times each day for oneweek when prompted by text message. People were asked about their level ofchoice in the music selection, their liking for it, the amount of attention paidto it and the effects of the music on their mood and emotions.Many of the congenital amusics in this study tended to avoid music and preferrednot to play it in their homes or cars.45 [part0017.html#c4fn45] But some didenjoy background radio and used music to modulate their level of energy.Interestingly, one of the most popular genres in the amusic group was jazz, agenre that does not rely so much on melody as pop, country or rock.So the situation with amusia is not clear-cut; amusics don’t hate all musicand/or find it incomprehensible. This makes sense if you think about it: musicis a complex sound with many different aspects that you might enjoy, such as thetimbres, rhythms or lyrics. You might also gain pleasure from the social andcultural aspects, the benefits of music that go beyond the sound. You mayassociate a favourite tune with a first love, or the tune ‘Happy Birthday’ withthe bright eyes of an excited child as they blow out their candles. The depth,power and reach of music in our lives means that we can gain appreciationthrough many routes, but those routes are likely to be different for a personwho has an underlying problem processing the musical sound.Amusics in their own wordsOne lady, I will call her Pat, has been taking part in amusia trials for nearlya decade. She comes from a large family that lives in a stunning part of ruralIreland where there is a big community musical tradition. Pat’s family run alocal shop that sells traditional Irish instruments and she and her siblingswere taught Irish music when they were children, as well as Irish dancing. Herbrother is a skilled accordion player. She, on the other hand, could never seemto get the hang of playing, singing or dancing, although she did learn to readmusic. She tried her best, practising for hours, but she could never seem tomove up grades and was never picked for local performances.Nowadays she would never choose to listen to music, especially in her own car,where it is talk radio or nothing. However, she has always encouraged herchildren to be musical and delights in telling stories of their musicalachievements. She also still enjoys visiting the traditional Irish session wheremusic is played by friends and family in the local pub.Pat has always been keen to understand why she is different. Why it is that,despite all her efforts over the years, musical performance and a trueunderstanding of everyone’s fascination with musical sound is beyond her.Like many people in her situation she was happy to learn that there was a reasonfor her reaction. It was not that she was stupid, not trying hard enough, or,horror of horrors, had no taste – an accusation that many with amusia face.Thanks to the efforts of people like her, who kindly offer their time fortesting, we now understand that she has amusia. Her brain is different in a waythat means music processing is disrupted for her. It is not her fault and shecan’t help it. She is missing something that the majority of us take forgranted.One of the most common analogies that amusics use to describe their experiencesis colour blindness. When I ask them, ‘What is the difference between these twotones?’ some amusics feel that the question makes about as much sense as askinga colour-blind person what is the difference between red and green. Theyunderstand that other people can probably perceive those colours in a differentway to them but the clear distinction reported by everyone else is not somethingthat is apparent to them.One amusic told me that people often ask what her life was like without music.She said that this was the equivalent of asking a blind person what it is liketo have never seen a sunrise: ‘You are asking me about something I have neverknown … so why would I miss it?’Other descriptions of amusia include having a ‘Teflon mind’ for music. Often aperson will describe how the sound of music does not stick around in their headlong enough for them to be able to fully process or understand it. It just slipsaway quickly and quietly. Alternatively, some describe it as like being handedan important piece of information and then having no idea how or where to fileit away in order to be able to find it again.During a recent conversation with an amusic lady, she described how fascinatingshe found it when someone played or sang music. She said that it must be like mewatching another human fly around the room. Flying is not something I ampersonally capable of doing, so I do not associate it with the realm of possiblehuman achievements. She feels the same way when she watches someone performmusic.Lastly I would like to relay the sentiments of another of my participants. Thisgentleman has always been clear with me that he does not want to be patronisedor pitied for his condition; the thing that he finds difficult about amusia isother people’s reactions. He is convinced that it is especially hard forchildren who find music difficult and he thinks that people in positions ofauthority, such as teachers, should be more aware that amusia exists.Differences in the amusic brainThe ability to make sense of musical sounds can be disrupted from the firstpoints of perception through to musical memory,46 [part0017.html#c4fn46] andeven the later, most complex stages of musical interpretation and integration.One of the consequences of this varied symptomology is that it has provedrelatively difficult to track down consistent markers for congenital amusia inthe brain.There has been little indication that there is anything out of the ordinary inthe temporal lobes, within the main auditory areas. Where structural differencesare found they tend to be higher up the music brain system in both the left andright hemispheres, in particular in the inferior (lower) frontal cortex.One possibility is that the white matter highways of the brain are more impactedthan the grey matter centres in amusia. One white matter pathway of currentinterest is the arcuate fasciculus (AF); you may remember this pathway fromearlier in this chapter, where I discussed how it was found to be denser inmusicians. Scans have shown that the AF may also be less well developed inindividuals with amusia.47 [part0017.html#c4fn47]As well as difference in brain structure, there are differences in the way thatamusics’ brains react to musical sounds. Early brain responses, measured by EEGscans, can be ‘muted’ (smaller or delayed in time). Amusics’ brains showexpected responses to out-of-key notes or notes that violate expectation but thereaction seems somehow weaker.48 [part0017.html#c4fn48]Interestingly, you can sometimes get a normal brain response to a musical oddityin amusia, in the absence of conscious awareness.49 [part0017.html#c4fn49] Inthese cases it seems like the brain spots the out-of-key note but the personremains unaware of this information. It may be that there is an abnormally highdegree of disconnection between subconscious and conscious processing of musicin amusia.50 [part0017.html#c4fn50]This brief look at amusia shows us that so many of the musical skills that wepossess, as simple as telling up from down, moving to the beat, or singing‘Happy Birthday’, are all complex and impressive in reality. It has taken thewhole of our childhood and adolescence to refine these musical skills and theyare quite simply the best of any animal on the planet.We take them for granted, just as we do the ability to read and speak. It isoften only when these abilities break down or fail to develop that we see themfor what they are – a truly remarkable achievement of the musician in all of us.music [../images/00002.jpeg]We have now explored the extremes of musical experience in adulthood: expertiseat one end of the scale, lifelong music difficulties at the other. That leavesthe majority of us somewhere in the middle, with an interest in music and theability to process it. The music of our lives has not impacted on our minds andbodies to the extent that it has in accomplished musicians but it has still hadan effect on how we process the music around us.Biased by listeningI can prove that you have learned a lot just from listening to music, because ithas biased your brain.By adulthood most of us have had decades of experience of only one musicalculture: in my case, Western tonal music. I have learned the structures andrules of that musical style in the same way that I have learned the structuresand rules of my native language, to the extent that I don’t need to think inorder to understand and appreciate the sound. By comparison, when I listen tothe music of another culture (for example, Javanese gamelan or Japanese hōgaku)that follows different rules and structures, I see the downside of my exclusivelearning. On first hearing a new form of music you and I are as lost as if wewere listening to a person speaking in a foreign tongue.Scientists at the University of Washington have studied why we struggle when wefirst listen to music from other cultures. The situation is not hopeless,luckily, as people are capable of working out musical structures withinunfamiliar music over time by just listening, in the same way that we can startto pick up the basics of new languages. This idea has been tried with a varietyof cultures measured against the experience of traditional Western tonal music,including traditional Indian and Chinese music, as well as unfamiliar Europeanstyles such as Finnish folk songs.51 [part0017.html#c4fn51]There are a few things that the majority of world musics seem to share. A recentstudy of music listening in adult Congolese Pygmies found that both they andWestern students reacted to the same simple emotional triggers in music liketimbre and intensity. This result suggests there are some basic universals inworld music communication that we can rely upon most of the time.52[part0017.html#c4fn52] Apart from this however, there is a very strong bias inthe way that we interpret crosscultural music, which is based on our ownunderstanding. The Pygmies in the above study showed fewer overall emotionalresponses to Western music compared to Western students. People are also lessable to remember music from an unfamiliar culture.53 [part0017.html#c4fn53]Finally, the brain shows an atypical response when listening to music from othercultures, reflecting the fact that we have to work harder to think about thesounds and are not so capable of understanding what might happen next.54[part0017.html#c4fn54] All of this adds up to an ‘enculturation effect’ in adultmusic listeners. The fact that we can’t instantly derive expectations forunfamiliar musical styles also means that typically we won’t initially like whatwe hear.Bimusical brainEnculturation may somewhat limit our first impressions of cross-cultural musicas adults but we can learn about more than one culture at once while we grow up.Some of you out there may have a ‘bimusical brain’.People who are fairly equally exposed to different musical cultures duringchildhood and adolescence appear to develop different musical systems andpatterns of brain activation compared to people who only really hear one kind ofmusic. This is not like hearing half classical and half hip-hop – genres fromwithin the same culture – as these will mostly use the same musical buildingblocks. To have a bimusical brain you need to be exposed to music that evolvesfrom a different set of rules.Patrick Wong and colleagues have been studying brain responses of people whowere brought up listening to both Western and Indian music.55[part0017.html#c4fn55] The researchers scanned the participants’ brains whilethey listened to both types of music and compared the responses to those ofmono-musical people, who had only heard Western music while growing up. Thebimusical people showed more complex patterns of brain activation suggesting, inparticular, that their emotional reactions to music are unique and have beenshaped by their bimusical heritage.Everything we see in the research about our cultural response to music tells usthat we have become biased by what we learn as children. Plus, intuitively, weall think that it is easier to learn an instrument as a child than it is as anadult. This does not mean, however, that we can’t learn music as an adult,either a new instrument or how to listen to the music of another culture. Whilethere is some truth to the idea of critical periods in music listening wherelearning is easier, there is little truth in the idea that you must be young topick up a new musical instrument or style.Music learning, extraordinary and ordinaryThere are tales of musical brilliance achieved in adulthood in extraordinarycircumstances, which give enticing clues about the power of music learning asadults. In his book Musicophilia, Oliver Sacks tells the story of a man whotrained himself to be a concert-level pianist as an adult after a freakaccident. This gentleman was hit by a lightning strike, a life-threateningaccident which left him with remarkably few after-effects other than a suddenaddiction to music where previously he had shown comparatively little interest.As well as upping his music consumption massively, he set about training himselfto play the piano, and achieved concert-level standard in an incredibly shortperiod of time. He became devoted to music and obsessed with music learning.A similar tale was recently reported in the UK press: a 39-year-old man was leftwith serious concussion after diving into the shallow end of a swimming pool.Before the injury he had played in a few bands as a teenager but never reallydevoted much time to music. Now he has been diagnosed with acquired savantsyndrome, meaning he has developed high levels of musical ability and technique(including composition) where there were no previous indications of such skills.He states, ‘It’s as if my knock on the head unlocked something latent, orenabled me to use some part of my brain I simply couldn’t access before.’56[part0017.html#c4fn56]Our brains’ party trick of plasticity means that we are born lifelong learners.We don’t need a bolt of lightning or a blow to the head to be able to learn howto play music, sing or compose; we can do the unlocking ourselves. It will takelonger and may be more hard work but I am pretty sure it is a lot less painful!One of my favourite books on this matter is Guitar Zero by Gary Marcus, apsychologist who decided to take on the goal of teaching himself to play theguitar as an adult and analysed the experience from the viewpoint of ascientist.57 [part0017.html#c4fn57] It is an engaging and fundamentally hopefulstory of how anyone can pick up musical skills at any age if they are preparedto put in the effort and consistently challenge themselves to reach new heights.Your plastic brain is there for the moulding.As far as we can tell, learning of this kind at any age has the potential toalter the brain as well. The academic and author Steven Mithen58[part0017.html#c4fn58] decided to take up singing lessons as an adult and wasinterested to see the effect this might have on his brain.59[part0017.html#c4fn59] He contacted a colleague and neuroscientist, LarryParsons, who agreed to scan Mithen before he started singing training and aftera few months of lessons. The scans showed a significant difference in areas suchas the auditory cortex and early parts of the frontal cortex. More recentstudies of adult musical training have shown similar effects, with the mostnotable brain changes being to the structure and function of the auditory andmotor cortices. These shifts look like the beginnings of the complexauditory-motor representations that we see in the brains of highly trainedmusicians.60 [part0017.html#c4fn60]Music, it seems, has the potential to mould the brain in multiple ways at anyage.61 [part0017.html#c4fn61]music [../images/00002.jpeg]In this chapter we have explored the musical adult and revealed that the normalprogression of musical learning through exposure, which goes on mostly behindthe curtain of our consciousness, gives us an in-depth understanding of themusic of our culture. In rare cases this typical development does not happen;adults with congenital amusia live with the everyday consequences of a musicprocessing difficulty. If we choose to boost the typical path of musicaldevelopment by taking on music education then our brain moulds itself inaccordance with our new skills and this has consequences for the way that wethink and behave in a variety of non-musical situations.There are critical periods for learning about music but our flexible brains arestill very much capable of learning in adulthood and music education at any agehas many positive benefits both for expanding our minds and for our well-being,as we shall discuss in Chapter 8. Now that we have set the stage for our musicaladulthood, let’s take a look at how we react to music in the real world,starting with adults at work.* [part0011.html#c4s1] The myelin sheath is a protective layer that coats theoutside of a neuron.

Work is and always hasbeen an inextricable part of human life in every culture.Sometimes, work is a pain. You may be one of the lucky individuals who adorestheir job but even then there will be days when the necessity of an occupationgrates on your nerves. On such occasions, we look for a way to dull any negativeimpact and make difficult work time pass more enjoyably. One of the greatescapes from work-related tedium and stress, across the ages, has been music.Music has been a feature of physical work for hundreds if not thousands ofyears, serving a number of functions including synchronising movement, creatingsocial bonds, relieving boredom and enabling communication. There are traditionsof work songs that span a multitude of cultures and languages, includingmilitary marches, sea shanties, industrial folk songs, cowboy cattle calls, andagricultural work songs. Venezuelan work songs (such as Cantos de pilón) are anexcellent example: these traditional folk melodies are often sung as anaccompaniment to activities such as milking cows, harvesting coffee andproducing cornflour.Work music has the power to engage our mind, absorb our perception of time andlift our spirits. All of this makes music an ideal accompaniment to bothphysical and low attention demanding chores, which would otherwise be drainingand tedious.The history of the relationship between music and work in the modern age beginswith studies of music in factories during the post-war period. These earlypsychological studies of the impact of music on worker responses, lead directlyinto the modern and ongoing controversy over whether we should have access tomusic at work: what are the benefits of being able to tap into music while atyour desk, doing deliveries, or preparing food, and what kind of music should webe hearing? Is music actually good for productivity?The use of music is not restricted to private work settings but is alsoprevalent in more public, commercial work environments: in our shops, bars,restaurants, garages, airports … in fact, nearly everywhere we spend ourhard-earned money we are surrounded by music. Why is music played in thecommercial working world? How does it affect the way that we behave in theseplaces? Do we really spend more, walk faster, or eat greater amounts?History of music at work1 [part0017.html#c5fn1]Some of the first psychological studies of music in the workplace took placearound the time of the Second World War when the modern factory conveyor beltassembly line used so successfully by Henry Ford earlier in the century reallycame into its own on a worldwide basis, triggering an age of mass production. Inthis period before the widespread adoption of automated handling systems therewere plenty of repetitive, tedious yet essential jobs along the production linethat required a careful human eye and hand.Unfortunately our minds are not designed to carry out the same series of actionsrepeatedly for hours on end; boredom, lethargy and lapses in concentration areinevitable consequences of such work. Knowing this full well, factory managersbegan to investigate ways to enhance active productivity (increased speed and/orlarger outputs) as well as minimise errors on production lines. One of the firstideas was to study the effects of piping music into the factory floor space.The British government introduced music in armament factories in the laterstages of the Second World War2 [part0017.html#c5fn2] and one of the firststudies in this area was carried out in a fireworks factory.3[part0017.html#c5fn3] These, as have several similar papers since, found a small(typically below 10 per cent) but significant increase in measures ofproductivity during repetitive jobs in the presence of music compared tosilence.As much as number crunchers would like to count every firework and relate thisdirectly to ‘productivity’, it is also vital to consider indirect measures ofproductivity, such as worker well-being. Workers reported feeling less boredomand fatigue on days when music was played.4 [part0017.html#c5fn4] It may be moredifficult to quantify the impact music has on productivity as it relates towell-being, but it seems clear that improving wellbeing can have an effect onoutputs and profits as happier workers are more likely to support their team andless likely to be absent.Why and how may hearing music influence productivity? We will go into thisquestion in more depth soon when we dive into the psychology behind backgroundmusic but the chief candidates for the increase in music-related productivity inthese early studies were: 1) a boost in rhythmic synchronisation, which enhancedspeed and hence regularity of output, and 2) physical responses to music such assinging and moving to the beat. These latter reactions were thought tocontribute to increased energy levels, buoyed by positive impacts onphysiological measures such as heart and breathing rate.This is human science, however, so nothing is 100 per cent effective. It isimportant to stress that not everyone likes music at work. Up to 10 per cent ofworkers would much rather be left in silence and some studies have shown thatquality of work can be adversely affected by music when people feel this way.5[part0017.html#c5fn5] As we shall see later, the more complex the work is, themore likely it is that music will act as an unhelpful distraction andconsequently will hinder rather than help productivity.6 [part0017.html#c5fn6]Overall however, the message from the early studies was that for simplerepetitive jobs music is better than nothing.The results from these factory studies began to reveal the effects of music onmonotonous jobs and I certainly can agree, from my experience of cleaningwindows as a young chambermaid, that music can be invaluable when it comes toengaging the mind during boring physical work. However, the kinds of roles thatwere put under the spotlight by these early factory studies are rapidlydisappearing from the modern workplace thanks to mechanisation. We need to alsolook at environments where the majority of workers are engaged for at least partof their life – the office.Music in the modern officeShould you listen to music while you work in an office? This was the subject ofa study by Greg Oldham7 [part0017.html#c5fn7] who looked at the use of stereoheadphones in a multi-purpose office building in the US, where people wereengaged in over 30 different jobs. Over four weeks he and his team tracked theprogress of 75 individuals who typically brought in their own music and listenedto it through headphones, and compared it to that of 181 people who did not tendto listen to music.The music group had significant improvements in performance (rated by theemployers), better opinions of work (less likely to be planning to leave),satisfaction with the work environment and better mood states, being morerelaxed and enthusiastic.An obvious problem with this study is its ‘quasi experimental’ nature – peoplewere not randomly assigned to the two groups (music or no music), meaning it ishard to conclude that music listening was the thing that influenced theirresponses. All we can assume is that people who like to listen to music at workfind it helps with their productivity and work satisfaction. So let’s thinkabout what happens if you take music away from these kinds of people.Teresa Lesiuk asked what happens when you remove a music-lover’s music in anoffice setting.8 [part0017.html#c5fn8] She followed the working lives of 56software developers from four different companies across two different cities.The study itself was a time-based intervention whereby Lesiuk monitoredreactions to music for two weeks, then removed the music for one week, andfinally reintroduced it again for a final week.During the music weeks the developers could choose from a wide range of tracksfrom a 65-CD library and could listen in the privacy of their booths. They hadto avoid music completely in the middle ‘no music’ week.In the weeks when the developers had access to music they measured significantlyhigher on mood. There was a noticeable dip in mood in the ‘no music’ week thatthen rebounded again when music was reintroduced in the final week. Quality ofwork was also rated as lower in the ‘no music’ week, and rebounded when themusic came back.One of the largest effects in the study was that of measured time-on-task:people took much longer to accomplish their jobs when their beloved music wastaken away. Although this study lacks a proper control group, it seems clearthat when people are used to being able to listen music in the workplace,removing it can trigger negative effects associated with psychologicalwithdrawal.Following on from this research, Anneli Beronius Haake conducted the firstlarge-scale studies to chart the way that music is used in UK office settingsand how it makes people feel. The conclusions from her research help tohighlight how music has multiple pathways to increasing work satisfaction andproductivity.Firstly, Haake carried out a survey of the listening practices of 295individuals who worked within computer-based UK offices.9 [part0017.html#c5fn9]Their occupations spanned administrative and management roles, as well as mediaand cultural services, medicine, science and technology, and teaching. Shelooked at how people chose to listen to music and what functions people feltmusic served. She also asked questions about what type of music people liked tolisten to in the office and what reasons, if any, would put them off listeningto music in this context.The most popular workplace artists were Arctic Monkeys, The Beatles and JamesBlunt, a result which reflects the UK sample. The most popular work music genrewas classical, with rock, pop and indie falling into a close second place. Theleast popular work music genres were soul and funk. Radio stations were alsomentioned frequently as popular ways to listen to music in the office, with BBCstations taking most of the top spots.Haake argued that the sheer variety of work-based music listening habitssupports the idea that there is no typical best ‘office music’. Therefore it isprobably a bad idea to simply pipe music into a general office space containingmany individuals who have different tastes, preferences and personalities.People in this survey were listening to music for 36 per cent of their workinglives, using headphones on 86 per cent of occasions. No one individual factor,including age, gender, stress levels or occupation, predicted music listeninghabits. One exception was that people who felt more stressed were more likely toreport that music was relaxing. Music listening in the modern office environmentis therefore a largely private pastime (hence the headphones) that eachindividual tailors in keeping with present demands and that can help managestress.Building on these results, Haake conducted interviews in order to understand howdifferent situations and motivations influence music listening choices at work.One idea that came across strongly was that music creates an ‘auditory cocoon’for people, isolating them from potential sources of stress and giving them asense of escapism to a personal space within a public environment.I often think of this cocoon idea when I see people charging around the Londonunderground with headphones attached to their heads. Music in this case providesa welcome illusion of detachment; minimising the sounds of other commuters, tubetrains flashing through tunnels and suitcases banging on escalators. Haake’soffice survey found that this self-created musical bubble can be especiallyuseful in the workplace as it not only blocks stressful sounds but also replacesthem with a source of inspiration and creativity. By these methods music can aidconcentration, boost task performance and reduce the potential negativepsychological impact of a long work day.We must also consider the downside to music in offices. Some people in Haake’ssurvey believed that music listening was viewed as unprofessional and avoidedlistening at times when they could be seen by senior colleagues or clients. Thisidea seems to underlie the misunderstanding that someone who is listening tomusic cannot possibly be working to their optimum. This is not true. In an openoffice situation it is important to be considerate to others and ‘present’ inthe work space, but we should also accept that private music can be helpful. Andas we have seen above, removing music as an option for someone who is used toits presence is probably going to do more harm than good.There is a delicate balancing act to be achieved between the potential for musicto distract or enhance performance. The key message is that music can help anindividual in certain work situations. The important thing is to be consciouslyaware of the choices that we make. Since the effects of music are highlyindividual, each of us has to acknowledge when music is helping and when it ishindering – for optimal work success we must always employ ‘smart musiclistening’.Is background music good for work?Studies of music in the workplace draw heavily from literature on the generaleffects of background music, and it is here that we find answers to thequestions of why and how music affects us in the workplace. Understanding theseforces is an important step in developing ‘smart music listening’ techniques.The types of study I will discuss in this section are not overly concerned withthe work environment. They are relevant, however, as they tackle the question ofwhether music can aid cognitive or motor performance in all kinds of arenas suchas studying, reading, problem solving and everyday tasks such as driving.10[part0017.html#c5fn10] Most importantly, these studies are carried out in acontrolled, scientific way so we can look carefully at the effects of music aswe try to carry out other simultaneous tasks.At the heart of all of these studies are a handful of mechanisms which hark backto the ‘Mozart effect’ (see Chapters 2 and 3): psycho-physiological arousal,cognitive engagement and mood effects.Psycho-physiological arousalArousal is an umbrella concept that describes your level of physical and mentalalertness at any one moment. The most cited scientific model that relateseveryday task performance to psycho-physiological arousal is the Yerkes–Dodson(Y–D) curve from 1908.11 [part0017.html#c5fn11]images [../images/00006.jpeg]A Hebbian version of the Yerkes–Dodson curve.This model and accompanying theory postulate that each person’s ‘base’ level ofpsycho-physiological arousal is somewhere on this upside down U-shaped curve.Some people have a naturally high level and some people have a much lower level;the peak of the curve is the optimum where we are all able to achieve our bestperformance.Music is an agent that can increase (push us towards an optimum) or lower (pushus over the top) our position on the Y–D curve depending on the characteristicsof the music, such as its complexity, volume and familiarity.The effect of music on psycho-physiological arousal is one mechanism proposed toexplain the so-called Mozart effect, whereby listening to music can temporarilyimprove performance on a spatial task. In studies of performance, the Y–D curveis often cited as an important factor that explains why, for example, fast andloud music can have a detrimental effect on reading comprehension compared toslow, quiet music:12 [part0017.html#c5fn12] the fast and loud music is morelikely to push you over your optimum level of arousal and performance willconsequently fall down into the area of weaker output.Cognitive engagementCognitive engagement describes the level of attention that we are able to devoteto a task. An optimal state of cognitive engagement is a ‘flow state’ wheremotivation is focused on the job at hand and task performance is optimised.13[part0017.html#c5fn13] One recognisable characteristic of such a state is thatwe tend to lose track of time.Music has the potential to contribute to a flow state partly in relation topsycho-physiological arousal (which is tied to attention) but also by the natureof our limited attention system. In theory we have a certain amount of attentionthat we can devote to tasks; if we try to do too much then we experience anxietyand if we use too little then there is the danger that we drift off intoboredom. In effect, music can soak up that extra unused attention during asimple task that may otherwise contribute to boredom and a subsequent suddenneed to surf the net or call a friend.MoodThe effects of music on mood are well recognised (as seen in Chapter 3, and aswe shall see again in Chapter 6). In relation to studies of task performance,music mood associations have also been called upon to explain findings such asthe Mozart effect, as upbeat music that improves mood results in better taskperformance compared to slow, sad music that depresses mood.14[part0017.html#c5fn14]Mood and arousal are often seen to go together but it is possible for them todiverge; for example, you can be in a positive mood and either very relaxed orvery alert. Therefore it is important to consider both arousal and mood asindependent agents that can be influenced by background music.These three agents, arousal, engagement and mood, all play a role in ourresponse to background music individually and in combination. ‘Smart musiclistening’ is a balancing act that requires a person to gauge their own level oneach of these factors and then to assess the demands of the task at hand. Smartmusic listening can then add a positive contribution to a task when it is usedto adjust any or all of the factors towards an optimum for performance.Even when we take into consideration general influences of arousal and mood,music does not impact in the same way on everyone. We need to consider theinfluences of personality, preference and choice.PersonalityThe last thing I did as part of my honours degree, back in 2003, was to designmy very first experiment. I wanted to understand why we choose to listen tomusic in certain situations; the problem was that I had no idea where to start.One evening I came home from university to find my boyfriend of the timeengrossed in a computer racing game. I slumped down on the sofa and watched hisprogress impassively for a while, glad of the distraction from my thesisdilemma.Then an idea struck. Before each race, my other half was taking time to choosethe music he wanted to hear. I asked him why. He said that the automatic musicselection within the game software was ‘rubbish’ so he always had to selectsomething more engaging. Was it because he didn’t like some of the music? No, itwas all pretty good, but some of it was more ‘effective’ than others. Hebelieved that modulating the music level would improve his performance. Idecided then and there – that was my thesis.I think my professor was rather bemused the next day when I announced that Ineeded a room decked out with a sofa and a computer game console for my firstexperiment. Nevertheless we managed to obtain a TV from the home studies teamand my other half kindly parted with his PS2 for four weeks.The next step was to get some music. I decided to remain as true to the genre aspossible and contacted computer game music composers. Many were kind enough todonate tracks for my experiment and I gathered in people to help me pre-rate themusic for levels of excitement, complexity, engagement and variety. My aim wasto select some low, medium and complex music in order to see if these differentlevels really had an effect on the way that people raced during a computer game.On top of this I planned to have two upper levels where I added first the lyricsand then all of the game sound effects on to the most complex musical condition.Including the silence condition at the bottom, I now had six increasing levelsof musical sound complexity in my computer game experiment.During this design phase I came across an intriguing finding that changed onevital aspect of my experiment. Apparently, people with different personalitiesresponded in a different way to background music. In particular I was struck byan experiment conducted by Adrian Furnham and Anna Bradley on the effects ofbackground music.15 [part0017.html#c5fn15] They were interested in the influenceof one personality trait: extraversion.In 1967 Hans Eysenck16 [part0017.html#c5fn16] stated that extraverts andintroverts differ in their level of cortical arousal, with extraverts having alower baseline level than introverts. Think of this baseline as being like aninternal source of stimulation or ‘psychophysiological arousal’, as I describedin the last section.You will remember that we all have an optimal level of arousal (the peak of theY–D curve) where we function at our best, and because of this difference inbaseline levels, introverts and extraverts differ in how much more they need toget to that optimum. Extraverts are naturally lower down on the left-hand sideof the Y–D curve and introverts are comparatively higher up.As a result of their higher level of internal arousal, introverts seek out lessstimulation from the external world, preferring quieter and more familiarenvironments. They are already closer to their optimum point so do not need toomuch more before they are pushed over the edge into the area of poorerperformance. Extraverts on the other hand, with their lower level of internalexcitation, seek out stimulation, such as daredevil activities. They have alonger way to go to reach their optimum. Furnham and Bradley drew a clearprediction for their study of background music: extraverts should benefit frommore musical stimulation whereas introverts probably won’t.The participants in the Furnham and Bradley study listened to three upbeat popsongs (‘Sowing the Seeds of Love’, Tears for Fears; ‘New Sensation’, INXS; and‘Strange Brew’, Cream) while completing memory and reading tasks. As expected,the introverts had poorer memory for the things they had observed when music wasplaying compared to the extraverts. The introverts also had a lower score on thereading task when it was carried out in music compared to silence. Finally, theintroverts reported that they were less likely to work with the radio on athome, listened to the radio less in general and found it more distracting duringthe experiment.When I read this finding as an undergraduate I rethought one aspect to mycomputer game experiment. Maybe my partner was an extravert. It made sense on anintuitive level: he was certainly much more comfortable in a crowd or at a partycompared to me, and to my horror he had recently begun to talk about skydiving.Maybe his desire to pump up the level of the music in his computer games at homewas being driven partly by his personality. So I opted to test the impacts ofgame music on groups of introverts and extraverts.My experimental findings replicated the Furnham and Bradley study result nicely:my introverts did worse in the most complex music conditions compared to theextraverts. Not only this but my extraverts showed a clear improvement as Ipumped up the musical complexity. Introverts on the other hand got better up toabout the middle level of complexity and then their performance started to godown as the level increased.My experiment and that of Furnham and Bradley show clearly that background musiccomplexity has a different effect on people’s task performance depending ontheir personality.There is, of course, another explanation. Because extraverts tend to listen moreto music in their everyday lives we can’t rule out the possibility that all wedid in these studies was create a more familiar environment for them.Whether you buy the psycho-physiological response theory or another explanation,these studies and others conducted since17 [part0017.html#c5fn17] have shownthat personality can influence task performance in the presence of backgroundmusic.18 [part0017.html#c5fn18] Going back to our initial workplace question,the implication of these results is that unless you can guarantee that all thepeople in a work space have a similar personality then you are unlikely to beable to select music that has a positive effect on everyone.Preference and choiceIn the early factory studies of workplace music there is often no description ofthe music heard other than a broad category such as ‘dance hall’. And a fair fewmodern studies do not compare different kinds of music, preferring instead tosimply compare the difference between music and silence. We know fromdiscussions in earlier chapters that this type of research design is limited asit tells us nothing about music in particular – it only informs us about theeffect of doing something other than nothing. For all we know you may get asimilar effect if you pipe in an audio book, the shipping forecast or animalnoises.If we are going to work out how music impacts on productivity and performance atwork as opposed to other types of sounds then we need to explore what kinds ofmusic have an influence on our psyche at work and why. In fact, personalpreference and choice over music selection may be the most important influencesof all.A lack of choice and control over the music that we hear is frequently cited asone of the main reasons for a negative appraisal of that same music.19[part0017.html#c5fn19] Simon Frith likened this adverse reaction to a socialresponse to territory marking. In this sense, background music is an overtdisplay that someone else has control of the space where you find yourself; thisdisplay can really irritate us.Back in the lab, Joseph Parente found that people completed anattention-demanding test better in the presence of their preferred music than inthe presence of their least preferred music.20 [part0017.html#c5fn20] Equally,more recent studies of music preferences and the effects of self-selected musichave re-emphasised the importance of music preference and familiarity ineveryday listening.21 [part0017.html#c5fn21]So why don’t scientists take more care with personal preferences when selectingmusic for experiments? Simply put, if researchers allowed people to bring intheir own music to play during a test then people would likely bring in so manydifferent varieties (slow, fast, loud, soft, all manner of genres) that it wouldbe impossible to control the situation in the way that science demands.The reality is that even if I did a huge study and found the most effectivepiece of background music for work then it would still have little positiveinfluence on task performance if you hated it. So ‘smart music listening’ musttake into account individual preferences and, ultimately, give an individual asmuch perceived control over the selection as possible.The bad newsThe studies above make it clear that background music can help some people, someof the time, when we apply ‘smart music listening’. We must not overlook thefact, however, that sometimes our performance does not benefit from music,whether the task is a driving game22 [part0017.html#c5fn22] or one that draws onvigilance,23 [part0017.html#c5fn23] memory24 [part0017.html#c5fn24] orwriting.25 [part0017.html#c5fn25]How do we reconcile these positive and negative results? In 2011 Juliane Kämpfeand colleagues carried out a large overview of studies into background music.26[part0017.html#c5fn26] She found nearly 100 suitable studies that wereclassified into a positive or a negative effect of background music onperformance. The studies were also classified based on the type of performancethey measured: ‘mundane behaviour’ (eating, driving), ‘cognition’ (reading,maths), or ‘emotion’.Overall, Kämpfe reported that background music had no effect on cognition andonly small effects on mundane behaviours. The strongest effect of music shefound was on emotional responses, but this result was still rather small andunimpressive. Kämpfe was also able to look at the effect of music over differenttime periods, as far back as the 1970s – she noted no systematic change ineffects that aligned with the increased exposure to music over recent decades.This main set of findings is, of course, a bit general as it comes fromcombining together the results of many tasks. We are most interested here ineffects that relate to work performance; and helpfully Kämpfe broke down themusic effects for different tasks. Here the results are clearer.The types of task that are most relevant to work relate to memory performance,reading and concentration. When it comes to jobs that tax our memory, overallthere is a slight negative effect of music on performance. When it comes toreading, the result is the same, a minor negative impact. It seems that when awork task is complicated and requires a decent amount of concentration then mostpeople (NB not all people) would perform better in silence compared to music.music [../images/00002.jpeg]So after all that, is music helpful in the workplace?I believe that music can help work productivity the most when we are engaged insimple, repetitive jobs, as it can counteract the negative side of such work onour physical and mental state, helping stimulate motor movements and boostingmood and arousal, without dragging significant attention away from the task athand.When considering whether music is helpful or not overall, it is important toremember that some people do not enjoy background music and certainly not thetype of music that was originally designed to assist work. There was a backlashagainst the use of so-called functional or ‘canned’ music in the 1970s and 80s.Musicologists rightly objected to the use of music as a manipulative work tooland the development of mass-produced music – e.g. ‘Muzak’ – for this purpose.27[part0017.html#c5fn27] There are many organisations who still believe that it isunfair to subject people to music en masse.28 [part0017.html#c5fn28] The rightto auditory privacy is one that must be taken seriously, as not everyone reactswell to music, even in situations where research has shown overall positiveeffects on both productivity and workrelated satisfaction.When we are talking about your average working day in a modern officeenvironment, there is little evidence that exposing people to music helps themto work significantly faster or better unless they are the type of person thatalready likes to listen to music while they work. In the case of such people,taking away or blocking music access will likely see a reduction in workplacesatisfaction and decreased work output.So the golden rule is choice. I hope we will never see an age where music ispiped out in open offices, because the influences of personality, preference andchoice mean that this action will likely impact negatively on as many people asit pleases. I am convinced, however, that providing access to music, for thosewho choose to listen to it in a private way, and encouraging ‘smart musiclistening’ (i.e. dependent on the cognitive demands of the task), makes for abetter working environment than a strict ‘no music’ policy.Music in the commercial worldWith a thorough understanding of the effects of music in the workplace, we cannow take a different route and consider the effects of music upon the consumersof modern work environments. What about the diners, shoppers and customers? Howdoes the music we play in this type of workplace affect consumer behaviours?Most of you are probably aware of the pop psychology ideas that music makes usmove faster, eat more, or buy more in shops and restaurants. And no doubt manypeople assume that this is why businesses must be interested in playing music.However, the real story is much more involved and interesting, and manybusinesses could learn a thing or two by glancing at the science.Just before we delve into the impacts of music on the consumer, let’s hold backfor a minute and consider the people who work in these environments. Goodbusinesses should and do consider the effect of music not only on the consumerbut also on the staff. After all, we are talking about shops, restaurants, barswhere people work every day. One excellent reason to consider playing music isfor the benefit of the staff.When I was sixteen I worked in a little gift shop in my home town of York. Theshop always played background music and this was one of the main things Ienjoyed about the atmosphere. In fact, this was the first place I was introducedto a haunting American vocalist and guitarist by the name of Eva Cassidy, whosemusic I have enjoyed ever since.Quite apart from the potential influences of music in the workplace that we havealready discussed, such as improving mood and boosting alertness, there isanother magic trick that music performs in this type of environment for thebenefit of hardworking staff: it can play with time.Music absorbs timeWe are often left bemused by the passage of time because our internal clock canbe easily influenced by how we feel (emotional, tired, and too hot29[part0017.html#c5fn29]) and by things that draw our focus.30[part0017.html#c5fn30] Music that we enjoy can also sway our sense of time, byaltering our mood and acting as an attention-absorbing time shield that protectsus from being overtly aware of the passage of time.Sometimes music causes time to fly. Time used to drag when I worked in my littleYork gift shop on a Sunday. On this particular day I was usually alone, with noone to talk to apart from the passing trickle of Sunday shoppers. On these slowdays the shop’s enjoyable background music helped absorb the endless minutes asI dusted ornaments and refreshed pricing labels. I learned the words to the EvaCassidy songs and sang along (in my head, to preserve the ears of any passingcustomer).The new and interesting music captured much of my excess attention that was notdemanded by the work tasks that I had performed over a hundred times before,attention that may otherwise have been focusing on time cues such as the tickingclock or the slow dimming of the light outside. As such, my concentration levelcontinued on middle-ground optimum; the day did not whizz by but the music tookaway the drag.Music for time absorption is equally important for consumers in shops andrestaurants/bars. Waiting is a top annoyance – waiting at a changing cubicle,waiting for till service, waiting for your meal, waiting for the bill. The bestbusinesses reduce the experience of waiting by adopting place filler techniquesto break up your sense of time passage. An example is topping up your water togive the impression that although the thing you are waiting for (your meal) hasnot arrived, the level of service continues. Some businesses also use music tosuccessfully warp the passage of time in their favour. In this case we tend tofind higher perceptions of the level of service.An important point however, is that the relationship between music and thepassage of time is not always oneway or intuitive. Music may help time pass whenwe would otherwise be bored and/or waiting but what happens when we are busyshopping?Richard Yalch and Eric Spangenberg31 [part0017.html#c5fn31] compared the effectsof music familiarity on shoppers’ estimates of the amount of time they spentshopping and the actual amount of time they spent shopping. In a replication ofearlier studies,32 [part0017.html#c5fn32] people shopped for slightly longerwhen they were exposed to unfamiliar music compared to familiar music, thoughthey actually felt that they had shopped for longer when they listened tofamiliar music.How might we explain the feeling that more time has passed when the shoppersheard music that they knew? Surely this finding goes against the conventionalwisdom that ‘time flies when you’re having fun’?The researchers argued that when people listen to familiar music they get aboost in psycho-physiological arousal linked to enjoyment and that this effectcan disrupt their perception of time. But because familiar music is more easilyprocessed by our memory, we can take in more of the detail, thereby leading usto think we recall more time passing than when we try to process unfamiliarmusic. This process can lead us to overestimate the passage of general time.33[part0017.html#c5fn33] Think of it as a magnifying effect of familiar music.Music and the consumerLet us continue thinking about ourselves as consumers and the potential effectsof music on how we behave in a shop or restaurant. Is there any truth to thisidea that the presence of music influences how fast we move or how much money wespend?There was a surge of music psychology studies in consumer environments in themid- to late 1990s and there have been a handful of applied studies since. Thisnumber is still relatively small compared to other fields, largely due to thedifficulty in carrying out scientific studies in real consumer environments.Although shop and restaurant owners are keen to understand how to get the bestout of music, they are often reluctant to let a group of scientists loose withtheir space and, potentially, their profit margin. However, the work that hasbeen done has benefitted our understanding of the impact of music in theseenvironments.34 [part0017.html#c5fn34]Does music make us move faster?Yes, it really does. One of the earliest studies in this area was conducted byPatricia Cain Smith and Ross Curnow in 1966.35 [part0017.html#c5fn35] Theyvaried sound level (loud or soft) in supermarkets and found that people chose tospend significantly less time shopping during the louder music sessions.Interestingly, however, they found no significant difference in the salesbetween soft and loud sessions. It seems that people spent similar amounts ofmoney whatever the volume but went about their business quicker when loudermusic was played in the background.You could suppose many mechanisms for this effect; maybe people were annoyed bythe loud music so got around the shop as quickly as they could. Not many peoplemention this possibility in the pop psychology consumer articles that cite thisstudy but the fact that the loud music did not influence immediate sales thatday does not mean that there are no negative effects of a loud music strategy inthe long run. This study highlights the importance of not only looking atfootfall or receipts – consumers can provide invaluable information about whythey behaved the way that they did if only people would ask them.This early supermarket study inspired one of the most discussed experiments inmusic consumer research, that of Ronald Milliman in 1982.36[part0017.html#c5fn36] Milliman was interested in the influence of music speedon consumer behaviour, rather than volume. He trialled fast (94 beats per minuteor more) and slow (72 beats per minute or fewer) instrumental music as well as ano music condition in a medium-sized supermarket in the nine weeks between NewYear’s Day and Easter. Importantly, the customers were asked whether theyremembered music playing, although there is no record of personal reactions tothe music.Milliman recorded how long it took people to move between two pre-designatedpoints in the store to give a measure of consumer pace. People moved slower withthe slow music (128 seconds) and faster with the fast tempo music (109 seconds).When people heard no music their result was in the middle of these two figures(120 seconds). So the evidence suggests that music tempo was either slowingpeople down or speeding them up.Of more interest to the supermarkets was the finding that people spent more whenthey heard slow tempo music ($16,740.23) compared to fast music ($12,112.85) – a38 per cent increase in sales volume. An increase in spending in response toslower music has also been reported in restaurants in Scotland, where peopledined for 13.56 minutes longer and spent 19 per cent more when the music wasslow compared to fast.37 [part0017.html#c5fn37]Were people aware of the presence of music in Milliman’s study? In the ‘nomusic’ condition nearly 10 per cent of people thought they had heard music. Inthe slow and fast music conditions this figure increased to a measly 12 per centand 13 per cent respectively. It seems therefore that when there was music, itwent largely unnoticed. This result may be a function of the age of the study,conducted as it was at a time when music in stores was less prevalent than it istoday. The important take-away point though is that awareness of the music didnot increase significantly as the music speeded up, so the effect on consumerpace is not something that appears to rely on conscious awareness of music.Many retailers base their music choice on reports of the Milliman study, and Ican see why, as it is one of the best I have read in terms of being wellcontrolled and executed. However it is dated and we need to look more now at thefull range of modern retail outlets. Signs of a positive shift in this directioncome from studies into alternative environments such as in craft markets38[part0017.html#c5fn38] and telesales39 [part0017.html#c5fn39]; both have shownthat the presence of music is associated with people choosing to linger forlonger.We even see an effect of music on movement when people are sitting at theircomputer. Chien-Jung Lai and colleagues40 [part0017.html#c5fn40] explored theeffects of music tempo (fast or slow) and listening scenario (the same musiccontinuously; the same music while browsing different web pages; and differentmusic while browsing different web pages) on behaviour in an online store.Participants viewed more web pages and underestimated the passage of time morewhen they heard fast music. Playing different music was associated with morebrowsing, overestimating time passage and poorer memory for what had been seen.Continuous playing of the same music resulted in the best memory for the onlinestore.This last study asks new and important questions about the relationship betweenbackground music and our movement in commercial worlds. It is all very wellmeasuring pace and time perception and showing that music can alter both, butstudies need to focus on what people take away from their shopping and eatingexperiences if we are to understand how these visits may alter future consumerdecisions. You may have moved faster in a store on one occasion because of themusic but if that left you with a negative impression or no memory of theproducts then we must question the value of this strategy for the business.Does music make us spend more?In the last section we saw a relationship between slow tempo music and spendingmore in a supermarket, probably as a consequence of how much more slowly we movearound the aisles. Furthermore, people spent more money in a restaurant inScotland when they heard slower music. But do these results replicate? And,importantly, do they hold for other consumer environments?When it comes to money spend, research has had more luck manipulating genrerather than tempo or volume. That is not to say that these other factors are notpotentially important contributors to how much we spend, but the strongestresults have come from altering music at the level of genre.Charles Areni and David Kim41 [part0017.html#c5fn41] looked at the influence ofplaying either Top 40 music (The Traveling Wilburys, Fleetwood Mac, RobertPlant, Rush) or classical music (Mozart, Mendelssohn, Chopin, Vivaldi) in thebackground while people shopped in a wine store. When people shopped during theclassical music phases they spent more money (an average of $7.43 compared to$2.18) and purchased individual bottles that were more expensive.This finding has been supported by a British study carried out in a restaurant.Here people chose a more expensive meal when classical music was playing asopposed to pop music,42 [part0017.html#c5fn42] though this effect was drivenlargely by people spending more on starters and desserts as opposed to maincourses or drinks.Why we choose to spend more in certain musical conditions is still a debatedissue. One possibility is that people enjoy their time more in theseenvironments. The classical music used in these kinds of studies tends to beinstrumental only and it may be that people enjoy the chance to chat with afellow diner or shopper in the absence of vocal music and as a consequence ofthis good experience they felt more inclined to spend. A simple preference forclassical music in the people tested also remains a potential explanation forthe effect.Another possibility, and one that has captured more media attention, is that themusic creates an environment which primes a context-appropriate response: in amore upmarket place we are subconsciously driven to spend more money because wefeel it is what we are supposed to do. This may be the case. Alternativeresearch, however, suggests a flipside to this theory whereby classical musiccan have a negative effect on purchases in some environments. In one studypeople were found to leave a restaurant earlier and consume less alcohol whenbackground classical music was played as opposed to pop, jazz, easy listening oreven no music43 [part0017.html#c5fn43].There is a hidden factor in all of this that may help to clear up why the samegenre can have positive effects on spending in one environment and not inanother. There is not one simple formula for the effect of music on eithermovement or spending; it depends on ‘fit’.Musical fitOne of the biggest influences on how we react to music in the commercial worldis the level of fit with the environment. You can forget most of the effectshighlighted in the last section to do with moving faster or spending more moneyif the music does not fit with the surroundings. In such cases, people are morethan likely to take a quick scan and walk right back out again.What is musical fit? I consider commercial musical fit to comprise two differentideas: how music aligns with an individual’s perceptions of their immediateenvironment (the shop or restaurant) and how well it agrees with theirsubconscious ideas about the brand. The success of musical fit influences whatwe choose to buy and, more generally, how we feel about a brand and thelikelihood that it will inspire loyalty in the future.Instant choicesMusical fit can prime our impulse buys. The most famous example is that of thesupermarket where researchers played either German or French music. When Frenchmusic was played, French wine outsold German wine by roughly 3:1. When Germanmusic was played, German wine outsold French wine 2:1. In an echo of the findingreported by Ronald Milliman, the wine shoppers were generally unaware of whythey had chosen a particular bottle.44 [part0017.html#c5fn44]Another nice example for you romantics out there is the study in a flower shop.Céline Jacob and her colleagues played either romantic music, pop music, or nomusic in this environment. The mean amount of money spent on flowers wassignificantly higher in the romantic music condition compared with the othertwo. The pop music condition did not lead to an increase in the amount of moneyspent compared with the no music condition.45 [part0017.html#c5fn45]These two studies together demonstrate the effect of musical congruence inpriming consumer behaviour. The music in these cases fit with the environment aswell as with a certain instant reaction (indulging in romance) or selection(wine from a particular country). There is a strong argument that the musicinspired these choices.In general, consumers are more likely to purchase products when the musicassociated with them is well matched. This is because, cognitively speaking, welove a situation where nothing is clashing or competing for our limitedattention and where, consequently, the drain on our processing resources isminimised. Well-matched music can create this kind of easy-to-processenvironment and act as a seamless ‘cue to execution’.46 [part0017.html#c5fn46]These effects, matching associations and positive reactions, also work forbrands.47 [part0017.html#c5fn47]Michael Beverland and his team revealed the importance of musical fit oncustomers’ idea of a brand through a series of twenty in-depth interviews.48[part0017.html#c5fn48] Music was found to be an important initial signal as tothe brand’s position, image and quality. Another clear result was that when aperson perceived well-matched music and store/brand image they experienceddelight that then fostered brand loyalty. One of the most telling quotes wasprovided by a person identified as ‘Melissa’, talking about a furniture store:> ‘It’s South American music and it’s got that whole ethnic feel. I love it. The> music fits in perfectly and it almost made the environment more jovial… It’s> like it could be in South America, because of the music… You just feel> welcomed there, you feel at ease’.The secret messages in musicOur impression of a brand is not only influenced by how well the music fits butalso the ideas or messages the music communicates on top of this congruence.Mark Zander asked 132 people to listen to 30-second radio commercials for afictitious brand of mineral water and then rate the endorser’s personality,their brand impression and their future buying intentions.49[part0017.html#c5fn49] They heard three different musical backgrounds to thesame advert: lively swing music, a slow piano ballad or no music at all.All the music was rated as congruent with the brand but the two musics createddifferent impressions of the spokesperson and the brand, and provoked differentreactions. The endorser was seen to have the most self-control when he spokeover the lively music. With the quiet music the brand itself was rated as more‘soft, reserved, devoted and gentle’ as opposed to those who heard the swingmusic, who rated it as more ‘agitated and animated’. Moreover, Zander reportedthat these brand associations were quickly learned and hard to undo, asparticipants had made a connection between music and advert, preferring alwaysthe first versions they heard, after only a couple of exposures.All this research highlights the multiple levels on which music can operate andwhy it is so important to go beyond simple ‘fit’ and think about what the musicalone may contribute to consumer messages. Music is capable of being a player ina brand concept but you must be careful to understand its impact on top of thissupportive role.music [../images/00002.jpeg]In this chapter we have taken a tour round the world of work from many differentangles and explored how and why background music can influence the way webehave, think, react and feel in work environments. The next step in musicpsychology research will be to move away from searching for largely fruitlessgeneralised effects (there is no one ‘best’ music for work) and strive towardseffective assessment of critical variables, such as feelings of control andconsumer reactions, in the many individual varied and complex situations thatmake up our modern working world.In the next chapter we will take a breather from all this thinking about workand indulge in some relaxation. We use music for our play even more than we useit for work; it is inherent to many of our fun rituals surrounding sport, dance,romance and TV/films. How and why has music become interwoven within our playactivities and how does it affect our precious downtime?"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 6Music at play‘There’s people making babies to my music. That’s nice.’BARRY WHITEThe last chapter examined how music has woven its way into the many differentmanifestations of our working world. This chapter will expose how music is alsoan important part of our downtime, our leisure – our ‘play’.It is not surprising that music has become such a central part of our leisuretime, as it’s clearly something that we enjoy. However, music consumption byitself is not something most of us tend to do much anymore. By that I mean it israre for people to just sit quietly and listen to music for pleasure. In my casethe last time I did anything like that was well over a month ago when I decidedit was time I sat down and listened to the 45s I had been given by my dad. I hada great time reminiscing and dancing around (yes, I do that) and thought tomyself, ‘I should do this more often’; naturally, I have not done it since.Some of you will be regular concert goers or festival attendees. This isprobably as close as most of us get to a music-focused, relativelyhigh-investment activity in the modern world. On average I go to the opera, ashow or a gig two to three times a year and I always have a wonderful time butit is a treat rather than a regular pursuit. Most of us could, if we wanted,just sit and listen to music any day of the week, as I did that one rainyafternoon with my dad’s 45s. But the fact is that we don’t.Music psychologists exposed our lack of interest in focused music listening byconducting Experience Sampling Method (ESM) studies, where participants areprompted at regular intervals during their everyday life (typically by textmessage) to report on their music listening behaviours and reactions. Using thismethod in 2004, Adrian North and colleagues1 [part0017.html#c6fn1] confirmedthat music was far more likely to be heard during leisure as opposed to worktime but also that this music exposure was mostly heard as a backdrop ratherthan being the primary focus of attention.A recent follow-up study by Amanda Krause2 [part0017.html#c6fn2] confirmed that,thanks to modern technologies, music has moved into nearly every aspect of ourleisure world. Moreover, Krause made the important point that this evolution ofmusic listening has been an active decision on our parts rather than a passivereaction to the boom in music access. We put music in our play time because wewant it there.Instead of listening in a focused way we have brought the music that we loveinto the background of our leisure time, in much the same way as we haveinvented ways to bring it into our working lives. When it comes to play,however, we have been more inventive than we have been at work; we use music fornumerous rituals and pastimes including dance, romance, cinema andexercise/sport. In this chapter I will explore all of these activities,uncovering the role of music and exposing how important it is when it comes tomaximising our enjoyment.Music and danceDance is rhythmic movement. The origins of dance stretch far back in humanhistory and, as far as we can tell, dance and music have always been intricatelylinked. There are languages that make little differentiation between the wordsfor dance and those for music.3 [part0017.html#c6fn3] Music and dance also havemany overlapping purposes. Performance of either makes extensive use of movementand sound, allowing an individual to demonstrate skill and stamina as well asempathy. They are mediums by which we can make expressive gestures, with the aimof both communicating and triggering emotion in an audience.4[part0017.html#c6fn4] Music and dance may also have both evolved as part of ahuman coalition signalling system, allowing us to form and strengthen socialgroup bonds, and signal group membership.5 [part0017.html#c6fn5]Having said this much, music psychologists pay relatively little attention todance in their research, preferring instead to study music in isolation withoutits long-standing cultural partner. To a certain extent this is justified asthere are many forms of music that were never intended to be paired with dance.And some forms of dance can be beautiful in the absence of music. The factremains, however, that music and dance go together naturally for humans,indicating that they must, at some point, have been combined to communicatesomething unique and special. What exactly does music add to dance, other than asimple auditory signal to bring us together?Animals move to the beatWe gain interesting insights into the reasons why music and dance may have cometogether by looking at animals and their ability to move to the beat, which isan important component of dance.There are numerous examples of animals that use coordinated vocalisations ormovement displays as signals. On the vocal side, gibbons and cuckoos duet todefend their territory, while whales, mice and skylarks sing to attract a mate.On the movement side, Jamaican lizards bob their heads and perform vigorouspush-ups to attract a mate while mute swans rotate in synchronised circles toregulate their borders. Finding an animal that both vocalises and synchronisesbeat-like movements however, is another matter.One reason for a lack of dance-like behaviour in animals may be that themajority are not able (or willing) to move to the beat in music. I am nottalking about clever synchronised movements here; I am talking about theequivalent of tapping your foot to the beat. For most humans this is easy. Formost animals this is seemingly impossible.Humans may be born with the understanding necessary to move to a beat. The beat,the thing we tap along to in a great track – the pulse of music – is notsomething that necessarily needs to be explicitly audible in music. Musicians donot need to emphasise the beat of music constantly in order for us to sense thepulse. We are capable of extracting the beat from music and, in most cases, agood beat will entice us to bob our head, move our foot, or snap our fingers.Beat that is not audible is often referred to as ‘implied’; it is something weperceive out of the sound, like the way we extract a sense of depth in a flatpicture. A great example of the use of implied beat exists in groove-based musicwhere the beat often emerges from a complex, multilayered and syncopated patternof rhythms and instrumentation. Groove music is present across a range of genresincluding funk, soul, hiphop, drum and bass, jazz and world music.6[part0017.html#c6fn6]You don’t have to be a trained musician or even an adult listener to get ‘beat’.Henkjan Honing and colleagues demonstrated that newborn babies, even when theyare asleep, exhibit an identifiable brain wave signature in response to aviolation of a basic beat.7 [part0017.html#c6fn7] In Chapter 1 we saw thatHoning made use of implied beat, using simple drum patterns, and measured theresponses of newborns to a dropped beat. The significant change in their brainwave signature in response to the dropped beat indicated that these infants weresensing the beat, as they reacted when it went away.Honing conducted a follow-up study with adult rhesus monkeys to determine iftheir brains showed a similar beat detection response. It turns out that thosemonkeys were sensitive to the basic temporal structure of the music, such thatthey noticed when important notes were removed. But their brains did not respondto a dropped beat.8 [part0017.html#c6fn8] It appears that some of our closestancestors hear music at only a surface level, without the cognitive skill ofextracting the hidden groove.It is not only our closest animal relatives that apparently lack the ability orinclination to move to the beat. There is little evidence that animals like dogsor cats, which have lived in domesticated situations with humans for thousandsof years, spontaneously respond to the pulse in music without being cued orpre-trained.Oddly enough, though, this lack of interest in moving to the beat is not true ofall animals. So far scientists have identified a rather strange-soundingcollection of animals that may be able to move to a beat. These include somespecies of parrot, songbirds, dolphins, bats, seals and elephants. What do wehave in common with this motley assortment of creatures, and what does this tellus about the nature of music and dance?‘Snowball’ is the name of probably the most famous animal in music psychology.If you have not heard of him then he is easy to find by typing ‘snowballdancing’ into your preferred search engine. Snowball is a male Eleonora orSulphur-crested cockatoo (Cacatua galerita) who first came to the attention ofscience in 2007 when he arrived at the Birdlovers Only Rescue Service in Indiana(USA). He was dropped off at this shelter with an accompanying CD of hisfavourite dance songs. Aniruddh Patel and his colleagues have spent many hourssince observing Snowball and putting his ‘dancing’ to the scientific test.The researchers took Snowball’s ‘favourite song’ (‘Everybody’ by the BackstreetBoys) and altered the original recording speed to make versions that were bothslower and faster by up to 20 per cent. They then filmed his dance-likemovements, paying particular attention to the synchronisation of his head bobsto the beat of the music.9 [part0017.html#c6fn9]Snowball did not move much to the very slowest versions of the song but he didbob along frequently to many of the faster versions. In all cases his head bobswere fairly well aligned with the beat, certainly above chance levels. Thisresult represents a remarkable feat considering Snowball is highly unlikely tohave ever heard his favourite song at these fast tempi.The discovery of dance-like musical synchronisation10 [part0017.html#c6fn10] ina non-human animal gives us clues as to why music is so important for our dancerituals. Animals that are capable of synchronised beat movements, like Snowball,rely heavily on links between the auditory and motor parts of the brain, asthese facilitate the ability to vocalise and imitate other animals’ cries. Thesefacts lead people to speculate that the ability to vocally imitate may havedriven the evolution of musical synchronisation.11 [part0017.html#c6fn11] Thistheory relied on there being no evidence for spontaneous beat synchronisation inanimals who are not natural vocal mimics; and no such evidence was found forquite a few years until just recently when somewhat reasonable tapping to thebeat was found in a female chimpanzee called Ai and a female California sea lion(Zalophus californianus) called Ronan.12 [part0017.html#c6fn12]We definitely need more evidence of flexible rhythmic movements in truenon-vocal mimics before we dismiss the vocal imitation theory of musical beatdevelopment. And even if vocal mimicry can’t explain the development of musicalsynchronisation by itself then maybe a combination of ancient drives isresponsible.Animals such as Snowball rely (as ancient humans relied) on vocal mimicry as acrucial element for social bonding and display rituals, which also frequentlyincludes the use of coordinated displays of movement. At present, the idea Ifind most compelling as an explanation of why Snowball and I both like to moveto music is that the past survival of our species relied on the coordination ofsound and movement for important signals.This theory leads to the intriguing idea that music and dance co-evolvedtogether in humans, since both social vocalisations and movement displays wereuseful to us, at some point in our history. Dance and music could send a morepowerful message in close proximity than either could accomplish in isolation;important messages like ‘we are a couple’, ‘we are a group’, ‘we are together’and ‘we are strong – so watch out!’These animal studies give us hints about the origins of the pairing of music anddance but we need to look at our own behaviour today to understand how wecurrently use both art forms and what they may usefully communicate in themodern world.Of the two main animal reasons to combine sound and movement, defence or mating,modern humans tend to go for the latter. There are examples of ritual humandefencemotivated displays still in existence, one being the New Zealand rugbyteam’s use of the Māori Haka war dance and cry (most typically one called KaMate) before international matches. The nature of modern conflict has minimisedthe demand for such demonstrations in general, but music and dance for romancehas never gone out of fashion.Sexy dancingWhen we move our bodies we give away all kinds of information about ourselves:age and sex, the state of our health and fitness, and more subtle inferencessuch as our emotional well-being, truthfulness and confidence levels. All ofthese cues are useful for someone with romance on their mind. Music provides away to facilitate these communications as it allows us to show off our abilityto synchronise and respond to the beat and emotionality in music.Geoff Luck and his colleagues from the University of Jyväskylä in Finlandconducted an experiment to determine exactly how much information we gather fromdance signals.13 [part0017.html#c6fn13] The researchers made use of point-lightdisplay technology, where an individual wears a set of sensors at key pointsalong their body that can then be illuminated against a dark background. Whatyou see from the point-light display is identifiable as human movement but isreally just a group of moving dots. This means the viewer’s judgements areunaffected by any other attractiveness cues that might draw their attention.Luck used this technology to ask the question, what type of musical dance movesare most appealing to a potential mate?In this experiment 62 heterosexual adults watched a series of 30-secondpoint-light animation clips of both men and women dancing to music from thetechno, pop and Latin genres. Luck and the team had previously rated each videoon seven different body-movement-related criteria: 1) body symmetry, 2) hip-bodyratio, 3) shoulder-hip ratio, 4) hip-knee phase angle, 5) shoulder-hip angle, 6)hip wiggle and 7) downforce. The video watchers were asked to rate the dancersfor femininity/masculinity, sensuality, sexiness, mood, and interestingness.For women watching men, ‘downforce’ was most strongly related to ratings ofsensuality. Men who danced with a lighter touch, making more use of bounce, forexample, were perceived as more sensual. In their final conclusions, theresearchers considered this aspect of the male physical display to be the bestindicator of attractiveness in dance.In contrast, men watching women found ‘hip-body ratio’ to be more indicative ofsensuality, sexiness and positive mood. ‘Hip-knee phase angle’ (the degree ofsynchrony between the movement of the hip and knee) was positively related toperceived mood and interestingness of the dancer.This study shows that the way men and women respond to music by dancing leads toa number of impressions in potential romantic partners. In fact, movement tomusic was found to be a more helpful cue to attractiveness in this study thanmany of the more static measures of body symmetry or ratios. Music thereforeprovides an important medium by which we can display visual attractiveness cuesthrough the synchronised movement of our bodies. Speaking from personalexperience, this all seems very convincing. I met my partner through a salsaevent a few years ago and to this day he captivates me when he dances.Music for romanceNow that this chapter is firmly placed in a romantic frame of mind I will moveon to look at the use of music in other courtship behaviours and the potentialimportance of music for the success or failure of such endeavours. In thissection we will see how music can attract a mate before you even meet them andcan influence their reactions to a subsequent romantic approach.Match makingYour musical likes and dislikes speak volumes to a potential mate. That is onereason why dating agencies all over the world ask about musical preferencesbefore attempting to pair people up. In Chapter 3 I discussed the importance ofmusic as a social signal for teenagers. As an adult your musical preferenceremains an important part of your social identity.Differences in musical taste are unlikely to be a deal breaker for peoplechoosing who to date but similarities in tastes are a key variable in earlyattraction. A study at a midwestern United States university carried out by DolfZillmann and Azra Bhatia14 [part0017.html#c6fn14] looked at 239 heterosexualundergraduates’ evaluations of a potential date based on a videotapedpresentation. Everything was kept the same about the videos except that thepotential suitor talked about her or his love of classical, country, soft rock,or heavy metal music.A love for country music was associated with a slight lowering of ratings givenby both men and women. A love of heavy metal music made men more attractive towomen but a similar musical fascination made women less attractive to men. Thereverse interaction was true for classical music, which lowered the attractionof men but increased ratings for women.What I find more interesting than the general trend in genre reactions in thisstudy (which is naturally biased by the location and age range of theparticipants) is the perceived importance of having matched tastes, which variedby gender. Women appeared to care less about whether a man shared their musicaltastes but this same factor had a big influence on men who, whatever the genre,were more likely to give high ratings to a woman if she shared their musicaltastes.This is one area of research where we would benefit from new studies to trackhow our responses to and levels of attraction towards potential dates based onmusical preferences may have changed as music has become more a part of everydaylife. No doubt reactions to different musical genres depend on time and place inthe world. The most important finding here is that when we are seeking a matemany of us place a heavy weighting on avoiding a music mismatch.Pick up lineMusic not only acts as an attractor based on preferences, it can also impactmore directly on the success of our courtship attempts.Imagine the following scenario: you are a single, available woman (sorrygentlemen, but there is a reason for this request as you will find out below)and you are taking part in a survey about organic products. Your role in thisresearch is to eat some organic and non-organic cookies and then to chat aboutyour opinions of the two products with another person who is also taking part inthe study. Could background music affect your responsiveness to a potentialadvance from this fellow participant? According to sneaky psychologists, it can.The above scenario was part of an experiment conducted by Nicolas Guéguen andcolleagues in 2010.15 [part0017.html#c6fn15] Unknown to the female volunteers inthis study, their discussion partner for this organic cookie experiment was anactor who was in league with the researchers. The actor (or ‘confederate’) was amale who had been chosen specifically as someone that the female volunteer wouldbe likely to find attractive, although not too attractive or people might besuspicious – about a ‘5’ on a rating scale of 0–9.This confederate had a script to follow during the experiment to ensure that hegave the same responses to every woman when discussing cookies. Before enteringthe main discussion room, the female participant was told that her discussionpartner was late, and asked to wait in a separate room. In this waiting roombackground music was playing, music that had been pre-chosen by other people aseither romantic or not romantic (neutral). She spent three minutes in the roombefore being summoned for the experiment.The two strangers were then introduced by the experimenter in the maindiscussion room and had their five-minute chat about cookies. The experimentercame back into the room and announced that the study was over but that sheneeded two to three minutes to finalise the data. The experimenter then left theroom.During this period of time the confederate launched into the key phase of thewhole experiment. According to the paper, ‘he was instructed to smile and to sayto the participant: “My name is Antoine, as you know. I think you are very niceand I was wondering if you would give me your phone number. I’ll phone you laterand we can have a drink together somewhere next week.”’The whole point of the study was to determine whether the female volunteer wasmore likely to give out her phone number if there had been romantic musicplaying in the waiting room before the fake cookie survey. It turned out that inthe romantic music condition the man’s success rate was 52 per cent; he got 23out of 44 phone numbers. In the non-romantic, neutral music condition he gotonly twelve numbers.In a recent follow-up study the same researcher group took their paradigm out onthe streets.16 [part0017.html#c6fn16] In this case the male confederate (againhe was called ‘Antoine’, but it is unclear if it was the same actor) approachedladies on the street to ask for a date when he was carrying a guitar case, a gymbag or nothing at all. Again there was a script for his approach to theunsuspecting members of the public and the researchers noted his success ingetting phone numbers.When he was accessory-free, Antoine’s success rate was 14 per cent. When he washolding a sports bag this rate went down, though not significantly, to 9 percent. When he carried a guitar case he was significantly more successful, with a31 per cent phone number conversion rate.The presence of music or a musical instrument does not, of course, guaranteethat any eventual dates will be successful or that a person will even turn up toa date once they have had a chance to go away and think about the situation, butit does apparently help to create a mindset where individuals are more acceptingof an on-the-spot romantic overture.The scientists argue that these two studies demonstrate the effect of music andmusicianship on immediate prosocial thoughts, choices and behavioural responses.Admittedly this is rather gender-biased work given that the research has onlybeen done on a male approach to a female, but this general argument is supportedby previous UK research where ‘positive music’ (that is, uptempo pop music thatwas perceived as ‘uplifting’) was associated with an increase in prosocialbehaviours such as agreeing to distribute leaflets for a charity.17[part0017.html#c6fn17]How does the effect work? In the case of the cookie study it could be that theromantic music puts people in a better mood and this in turn makes them morelikely to accept the charming confederate’s advances. Or it could be a moredirect effect whereby the romantic music primes congruent responsive behaviours.For example, the act of recalling past romantic actions and/or events from lifeis known to result in more chivalrous behaviour in males.18[part0017.html#c6fn18] In the ‘on the street’ case it may be that in a youngattractive man the appearance of being a musician is associated with additionalphysical and intellectual abilities. These intriguing possibilities still needto be picked apart, and looked at properly across genders, if we are to fullyunderstand the effect of music and musicians on our heartstrings.Music and filmsCinema has used music longer than voices. The world of the silent film was farfrom silent, being filled with dramatic orchestral, piano and organ scoresincluding some of the best film music ever made. You only have to watch therecent Oscar-winning silent film The Artist to experience the cinematic power ofmusic in the absence of the human voice.Music is undoubtedly intertwined with film thanks to its ability to triggeremotive responses in the listener. But how does this happen? And do films reallyneed music? We have been talking romance for a while now so let’s examine two ofthe other key functions of cinema: to trigger fear or joy, and to make us cry.EmotionsHave you ever watched a really scary film without the music? Most people that Iknow (I have been observing them slyly since I started to write this book) tendto do one of two things when a film reaches a really scary moment: they covertheir eyes or stick their fingers in their ears. I am an ears person, everytime.This anecdotal evidence suggests that a great film soundtrack has a biginfluence on our emotional reactions; in the case of a scary film, silencing theexpertly crafted fright music can be sufficient to render an otherwiseunbearably scary moment watchable again.Does film music really have the power to scare us? Our subjective feeling offear is associated with the activity of several brain areas but in particularone small structure called the amygdala (from the Greek word for almond, as itis shaped like one), which sits more or less in the centre of your brain (seediagram on page 83). The amygdala is a relatively primitive brain structure thathas reportedly changed very little throughout mammalian evolution.19[part0017.html#c6fn19] It is part of the limbic system, which is associated withthe regulation of emotional responses.The amygdala sends out messages that trigger activity in our sympathetic nervoussystem, which regulates many aspects of body function including the famous‘fight or flight response’ whereby our body prepares for action when faced witha threat: our breathing quickens, our pulse races as blood floods into ourmuscles, and we begin to sweat.Numerous studies have shown that emotional music can trigger activity in theamygdala.20 [part0017.html#c6fn20] One patient who suffered amygdala damagereported that he could no longer experience the peak emotional responses tomusic that were common for him before his brain damage.21 [part0017.html#c6fn21]Another study of patients with amygdala damage found that they could no longerexperience fear when listening to scary soundtracks such as the theme tune toJaws.22 [part0017.html#c6fn22]All this evidence suggests that scary music directly activates our brain fearcentre; however, it is also likely that activation of the amygdala is linked tothe context of the music, since the amygdala has an additional role in memoryformation. Is it really the music that we find scary, or is there somethingmagic going on between music and film?Eran Eldar and colleagues23 [part0017.html#c6fn23] explored whether context isimportant to how much we feel moved by film music. Volunteers in their studyrated novel ‘scary’, ‘joyful’ or ‘neutral’ music alone for arousal (low to high)and valence (negative to positive emotions). The volunteers then made a similarrating when each of the music clips was combined with twelve seconds of neutral,no-dialogue film, such as a scene where a car drives across a desert.Sure enough the neutral music added no emotion to the neutral film clips,whereas the negative music made the same clips seem more scary (high arousal andnegative emotion) and the positive music made things more joyful (high arousaland positive emotion). This result supports our suspicions that music can injectemotion into an otherwise bland and meaningless film scene.Importantly, the people in this study also rated the films, the music and thenthe combination of music and film for their ‘concrete content’. Concrete in thissense means that something is tangible or real as opposed to feeling abstract.The music in isolation was all rated as very low in concrete content, reflectingthe fact that music on its own in this case means very little. The film clipswith and without music, by contrast, were rated as significantly higher inconcrete content.One final key finding was that the addition of music significantly increased theconcrete nature of the film. Therefore this study shows how music can give filmits emotional overtones and film in return gives music a tangible meaning.24[part0017.html#c6fn24]What is happening in the brain when all this is going on, and more specificallyin the amygdala? In a second phase of Eldar’s experiment, new volunteers lay inan fMRI scanner and watched the film clips while they were paired with thepositive (joyful), negative (scary) or neutral music. When people heard thenegative music combined with the film there was greater activation in theamygdala compared to when they heard only the music or saw only the film clip. Asimilar pattern was identified for the positive music/film combination but thiswas less consistent, which makes sense since amygdala activation is morestrongly associated with fear than happiness.25 [part0017.html#c6fn25]The combination of fearful music and a neutral but concrete film clip thereforetriggered a greater matched emotional reaction than either the music or the filmalone, as rated by hand in the first study and as evidenced by brain activity inthe second.Overall, film music by itself can be mildly scary but when embedded in cinematicconcrete context it has the power to enhance our sensory experience and toreally frighten us; this film/music combination makes something more emotionallyengaging than either watching or listening in isolation. The presence of filmpermits the meaning of the music to be directly interpreted in a similar way byeveryone, something that is more variable if we just hear music on its own.26[part0017.html#c6fn26] For example, we can easily confuse a film soundtrack asbeing romantic instead of dramatic when we are missing the film context.27[part0017.html#c6fn27] In return, an otherwise neutral visual film scene getsenhanced emotional attention and engagement thanks to the music-relatedactivation of our brain’s limbic system.28 [part0017.html#c6fn28]TearsFilm music can be designed to do more than just scare us. It allows us toexperience an enhanced wealth of emotions. I tried a recent experiment with thisbook in mind, where I watched the two films that are guaranteed to make me cry:The Notebook and The Bridges of Madison County. Both of the key scenes where Itend to break down (if you have seen these films then you know what I am talkingabout) have no language content, just beautiful music and heart-wrenching visualscenes. So I tried watching them without the music. Nothing: dry eyes. And Itell you something, I am never doing that again. It did not ruin the whole film– just the best part.This personal experiment and my reaction raise an interesting related question.Why would I want to make myself cry with music? I was not in a particularly lowmood on the days that I watched these films and in general I am not a fan ofmaking myself miserable. This question is relevant to the larger question of whywe choose to listen to sad music at all.According to David Huron29 [part0017.html#c6fn29] the science behind sad musiccan be traced back to our brain’s response to sad events in real life, such asheartbreak or the loss of a loved one. When genuine sad events befall us, ourbrain reacts to tears by releasing neurotransmitters into the brain that willalleviate the gutwrenching emotion. That is why many people report feelingbetter, or at least numbed from their pain, after a good cry. When we listen tosad music in the absence of a sad trigger event we are creating a kind of‘pseudo-sadness’ situation within ourselves, effectively tricking our minds intothinking we are terribly sad when in fact nothing is really wrong.One particular neurotransmitter that may be a target for our ‘pseudo-sadness’music listening behaviours is prolactin, a brain chemical that is naturallyreleased in response to genuine grief. In the case of music listening, in thewords of Huron himself, ‘now you have the prolactin release without the psychicpain. So at the end of the day, you’re actually feeling quite good.’ Sad musicin a film has the potential to raise the emotional stakes, stimulating a brainresponse that has an effect on how we feel when the titles roll.This theory may explain why I did not enjoy my favourite sad films when I turnedthe sound down. No music = fewer tears = less cathartic release and not so muchof a mental hug. So, I say three cheers for film music writers and their abilityto take the emotional impact of the best stories to a higher level.MeaningThe final role of music in film is to help guide us towards an evaluation ofmeaning. This goes beyond the emotional meaning as described in the last fewsections as music can also inject meaning regarding characterisation, includingresponses, reactions and intentions of actors.30 [part0017.html#c6fn30] Thesetechniques and effects are inherited and adapted from earlier art forms such asopera.The simplest form of musical meaning in film is the identification of genre,series and characters. Film music is full of ‘leitmotifs’, short repeatingmusical phrases that reoccur at various times throughout the film. Leitmotifswere famously used by Richard Wagner in his cycle of four operas, Der Ring desNibelungen, with a similar aim of relating the audience to specific charactersand situations. Most films nowadays have their own leitmotif, one that isrelated to the main theme tune, and that reoccurs throughout the action in orderto reinforce the character of the individual film or film series (such as in theJames Bond or Indiana Jones films, for example).Film characters can also have their own personal leitmotifs to mark theirpresence in the story, either physically or in the minds of other characters onthe screen. This is sometimes referred to as the musical indicator or ‘mark’.The Superman films provide a prime example of this technique. For the audience,the sound of that classical triad-based motif signals to us that the man ofsteel is on his way and that the chaotic destruction unfolding on the screenwill soon be fixed. Similarly, thanks to the use of a simple two-note motif inthe Jaws films, you don’t need to see a fin in the water to know that trouble isclose by.A film soundtrack can also lead us to understand far more subtle aspects ofcharacterisation. For example, consider The Artist, the excellent Oscar-winningsilent film starring the talented Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo as GeorgeValentin and Peppy Miller. The vast majority of this film contains no clue as tothe feelings or plans of the two main characters other than their facial andbody reactions and the incidental music that accompanies the entire film.In this style of film, the music is an integral part of the action descriptionfor the audience, which guides evaluation and predictions for what might happennext. Aspects of these soundtracks help us to understand what is happening andwhether we should regard this change of events in a positive or negative way.This is often referred to as the use of idée fixe, a technique that probablypredates leitmotifs in cinema and which was arguably far more important in thesilent film genre. It represents the use of music to reveal hidden or invisibleconnections between characters (such as hidden passion or antagonism) or toindicate links between different elements in a plot.31 [part0017.html#c6fn31]In conclusion, a film soundtrack, something many of us probably hardly noticeuntil it is taken away, has the power to lead us gracefully and gently throughthe many layers of narrative, characterisation and plot twists within a film. Itcan take us to the heights of emotional reaction and reveal the hidden depths ofa great story. You know where you are in a film thanks to the music.Music and sportFor the few, sport and exercise is a career choice but for the majority of us itis a leisure activity that we engage in for fun and/or health benefits. Many ofus also choose to watch sport in our free time and can devote our lifelongloyalty to a particular team or sportsperson. Whether as a participant or as aspectator, music plays an important role in sport and exercise in terms ofmotivation, performance and team spirit.Get moving!In the previous chapter I gave examples of how music at different tempi andvolumes can change the way we move around commercial spaces such assupermarkets. It should not come as a huge surprise then that music can help usmove while we engage in sport. In the case of sport, however, it is usually theindividual themselves that seeks out the music to try to help them keep moving.Most of us expect to hear a certain type of music in the gym, a type of musicthat we assume is going to somehow assist us with our workout.32[part0017.html#c6fn32] People also spend time designing and updating their ownmusic playlists for workouts. Is all this music really helping?It is now widely accepted that music can aid exercise effectiveness, which isdefined in different ways depending on the exercise but can include measuressuch as how long someone continues to work out (endurance) or the amount ofeffort that they exert (strength and power).33 [part0017.html#c6fn33] The termused for music in this context is ergogenic, which means that it is an externalagent that has a measurable impact on performance. So caffeine is alsoergogenic, as are performance-enhancing drugs. How does music have these kindsof effects?Music works well as a blocker for the signals of mental tiredness and physicalexhaustion that your brain receives during exercise. Listening to complex music(as opposed to simpler music) is thought to occupy a significant amount of ourlimited attention system and may therefore reduce the number of these tirednessmessages that get through, or may reduce their effect on our reactions.34[part0017.html#c6fn34] One of the results of this is that we lose track of howhard we have worked or how long we have been exercising. The typical reaction tothis situation is to work out for longer; music ‘colours’ our impression offatigue.35 [part0017.html#c6fn35]If the only mechanism at play here is that of blocking out the world and therebytricking us into working out for longer, then we might ask why music should beany more effective than audio books or podcasts. These options are popular withsome people but their usage cannot compare to the vast majority who would prefermusic. What is it within music that encourages us to exercise harder, forlonger?In two review articles published in 2012, Costas Karageorghis and David-LeePriest summarised the research into music and exercise over the last decade,since the introduction of good controls and the use of standardised protocolsrecognised by sports bodies.36 [part0017.html#c6fn36] They identified amultitude of positive music effects on exercise other than a simple draw on ourattention: triggering or regulating emotions, altering moods, evoking memories,psycho-physiological arousal, reducing inhibitions, and encouraging rhythmicmovement. Music is doing a lot more for your workout than simply occupying yourmind.Pre-exercise music can be a useful way to stimulate arousal levels up to thosewhich are needed for effective exercise. In one memorable experiment,researchers played either the theme from Rocky or silence before sendingvolunteers out on a 60m dash; the music condition led to faster times andphysiological reactions that were consistent with a pre-stimulating agent,including increases in breathing rate and muscle tension.37[part0017.html#c6fn37] Enjoyable music can also boost our confidence beforegoing into an exercise routine, which may then have knock-on positive effects onsuccess.38 [part0017.html#c6fn38]During exercise, music can aid movement by acting as a synchronisation partnerthat in one study lengthened a treadmill-based routine by 15 per cent onaverage.39 [part0017.html#c6fn39] The overall average expected enhancementeffect of music on people’s (perceived) effort expenditure in low to moderateexercise is estimated at a reasonable 10 per cent.40 [part0017.html#c6fn40] Theuse of music before and during exercise has also been found to increase strengthoutput as measured by the amount of time people are able to hold a weight out infront of them at arm’s length and shoulder height.The newest music contributions to the exercise world are programs that adaptthemselves to the pace and pattern of the user, using changing rhythms toencourage optimum movement and to ‘reward’ people when they keep up with thepace.41 [part0017.html#c6fn41] So far these music programs have found somesuccess with reported motivation and focus but the jury is still out as towhether the music really helps people move to a certain pace or significantlyreduces how exhausted they feel.42 [part0017.html#c6fn42] One factor that needsto be considered is whether people like the music, since preference for musichas been shown to have a measurable effect on important exercise outcomes suchas the (perceived) rate of exertion.43 [part0017.html#c6fn43]The tempo of music is one of the most crucial aspects that may alter exerciseoutcomes; this varies little from individual to individual. When it comes tomotivation, the music that makes me feel good during exercise relates to myindividual preferences and previous associations with the music.44[part0017.html#c6fn44] When it comes to tempo, however, the current advice isthat younger adults should be listening to music within the high tempo band of125–140 beats per minute when engaged in repetitive, aerobic-type activity.45[part0017.html#c6fn45] At the time of writing there is not enough research onolder adults to be able to draw a comparable figure.Conversely, medium tempo music apparently has enhanced effects on our perceptionof flow and motivation during exercise compared to fast or mixed-up tempos.46[part0017.html#c6fn46] Interestingly, tempo may be less effective when removedfrom a musical context. When scientists have tried using just drumbeats, theyhave often found poorer outcomes compared to when those same tempo rhythms areembedded in normal music.47 [part0017.html#c6fn47]Gender plays a role in responses to music in exercise as well. There is someevidence that women respond better than men to ‘motivational’ music in exercisessuch as circuit training, whereas men outperformed women in a condition wherethey listened to a simple metronome. In fact, the men did as well with themetronome as they did with the motivational music, which suggests a greaterreliance on beat within music for pacing, whereas women get an extra boost frommusic content.48 [part0017.html#c6fn48]One notable point about the music and exercise literature is that there are anumber of published studies that report insubstantial or null impacts of musicon performance. In some areas the number of such publications is significantenough for us to question whether music really has a reliable effect on everyonewhen it comes to all forms of exercise. However, the potential power of music inwell-controlled studies to reduce fatigue and extend/enhance aerobic andstrength performance is such that, overall, the findings advocate trying musicif you are interested in upping exercise performance.AthletesTrained athletes are often seen using music while training and before competing.During the London Olympic Games I watched swimmer after swimmer approach thepool in headphones, only removing them at the last minute before diving into thewater. Ethiopia’s Haile Gebrselassie famously requested that Scatman John’s‘Scatman’ be played before a world record attempt49 [part0017.html#c6fn49] whileOlympic gold medal-winning shooter Suzy Balogh from Australia is partial to awide range of music including Jamiroquai’s ‘Canned Heat’ and the Star Wars themebefore a competition.50 [part0017.html#c6fn50]Athletes report using music as a motivational tool and some claim that it reallymakes them work harder.51 [part0017.html#c6fn51] I have no doubt that in apacked arena full of screaming and chanting people it is very useful to be ableto block out distractions and focus on the all-important mental preparationbefore a race, bout, match or performance. But is there any truth in the beliefthat music can actually aid top athletic achievements?A recent study of the effects of music on high-intensity short-term exercise intrained athletes was carried out by a research group in Tunisia.52[part0017.html#c6fn52] The authors selected high tempo music (120–140 beats perminute) and had twelve male athletes either listen to the music or silenceduring a ten-minute warmup before they performed the Wingate test, a measure ofpeak anaerobic power in the legs. The athletes then did the test again after a48-hour recovery period. Heart rate and measures of fatigue were not affected bythe presence or absence of music but power output during the test wassignificantly higher after the music-based warm-up compared to silence.Another recent study suggests that music may be good for team sports as well asindividual performance.53 [part0017.html#c6fn53] Researchers at the Institutefor Sports Science at the University of Hannover in Germany presented findingsthat suggested synchronised rhythmic music is associated with better performanceof a football team. Compared to hearing nothing or asynchronous music (throughwireless headphones), players who heard synchronised fast music performed betteron measures of teamwork, including frequency and accuracy of passes.Unfortunately the results of both these studies, while convincing, do not allowus to better understand why the researchers found better individual or teamperformance, as they reported no effect of the music on any direct physiologicalor psychological measures – only performance output. It could be the case thatathletes perform better in those conditions because they simply believe music isgood for them.Two studies have actually suggested that music may be more beneficial foruntrained people when compared to trained athletes.54 [part0017.html#c6fn54] Themusic in these studies had a better effect on positive outlook following anexercise session in untrained people, a finding which suggests that music may bemost beneficial to those starting out in a new sport as opposed to those whoalready have their own routines and habits. The authors also speculated thattrained athletes benefit more from intense mental concentration during theirsport and music that they are not used to could provide an unwelcome drain ontheir precious mental resources.One promising area in the linking of music to athletic prowess is the effect ofmusic on synchronised movements. One study tested the performance of elitetriathletes on a treadmill where they had to run hard until they could run nomore. In the presence of synchronous music the athletes were able to endure therun for longer and reported better mood and physical reactions after the runcompared to when they heard neutral music or nothing at all. The authors arguedthat the synchronised music helped to encourage exercise that was moreoxygen-efficient by stimulating the athletes into a more rhythmic and regularpattern of movement; their running was effectively made more economical.55[part0017.html#c6fn55]Athletes who are used to music as part of their rigorous and extensive trainingregime would not go without it in a major competition. Luckily modern musictechnology means that they can now bring their musical sports world into theinternational arena for us all to see. This display of sporting headphone usedoes not mean, however, that music is necessary or even beneficial for eliteathletes. Attempts to understand exactly why music can mentally influenceathletes have often struggled to pin down really convincing patterns that aretrue for one person as much as the next.56 [part0017.html#c6fn56] Thisdifficulty at least partly stems from the fact that the effects of musicallistening in elite sportsmen and women are highly influenced by the individual’ssport of choice, their personal habits during a lifetime of training and,crucially, their preferences for techniques that help reduce anxiety and getthem ‘in the zone’.57 [part0017.html#c6fn57]music [../images/00002.jpeg]In this chapter we have seen that music has once again crept into our dailylife, this time during activities that we enjoy for relaxation, for energy, forhealth and for escapism. Music is frequently an essential partner to ourprecious free time, whether we prefer to spend it dancing the night away in aclub, curled up on the sofa watching a good film, or jogging around the localpark. The music in these activities is an enhancing agent, moving us to a higherlevel in every sense: physical, psychological and emotional.Throughout the book so far we have seen evidence that our reaction to musicdepends very much on our own life experience with music and our own preferences.In the next section of the book we will move from looking at general adult life(work and play) to viewing the broader context of our whole lives. It is time tolook at how we develop these musical personalities and how they can influenceour life journeys.In the next chapter we will move on to a subject that I find uniquelyfascinating within the field of music psychology: memory. I will break down thedifferent components and influences of music on our minds to answer the questionof why musical memory is so powerful. Why does hearing a tune take you rightback to that special event or person? Why is it that musical memory seems tosurvive in many cases when other memory systems are beginning to fail or aredamaged by trauma? And why do musical memories regularly pop into our head andthen repeat themselves, stuck on a loop, driving us mad? The stories of musicalmemory portray the development and power of your life soundtrack."},{"pageContent":"PART IIIMusic across the lifespan"},{"pageContent":"Chapter 7Music and memory‘What I like my music to do to me is awaken the ghosts inside of me. Not thedemons, you understand, but the ghosts’DAVID BOWIEI have always been fascinated by memory. I have explored many different aspectsof human psychology with relation to our musical lives, but whichever way Iturn, the subject of memory appears. When I am examining the abilities ofamusics, I end up looking at memory function. When I am researching how musiccan aid language learning,1 [part0017.html#c7fn1] I find myself talking aboutthe important role of memory in the process. Even when I am looking at thepositive effects of music in cancer care the importance of each person’s musicalmemory begins to take centre stage.What is memory? To most people memory is the part of the mind that helps usremember a shopping list or a pin number while also seeming to delight in hidingthe last known location of our keys. To me, memory is the key to understandingour experience of consciousness, learning and sense of identity; it is the gluethat holds us in the present moment, allowing us to reflect on the past and planfor the future. We’ll see later in this chapter how the destruction of memorycan have a devastating impact.The term memory encompasses many different processes that enable us to hold onto and manipulate information and life events.2 [part0017.html#c7fn2] There aretwo main memory systems discussed in this chapter that I will elaborate onbefore we begin: episodic and semantic memory.Episodic memory is memory for events in time while semantic memory is staticknowledge. Consider an orange (I just happen to be eating one as I write): anepisodic memory for an orange could be the memory of a shopping trip the lasttime you bought one or the memory of a fantastic meal that featured orange; asemantic memory by comparison would be the knowledge of how to eat an orange orhow you might cook with one.Episodic memories have a temporal element to them, meaning they can be replayedin your mind’s eye. They can be autobiographical too, if they are your memoriesfor events that have happened to you. With these kinds of memories people canoften re-imagine themselves in that situation, relying on the ability to indulgein what the psychologist Endel Tulving referred to as ‘mental time travel’.But there is also another, secret memory system. Implicit memories are the kindsof knowledge that we find hard to describe to another person, typically ourskills and abilities such as playing a musical instrument, riding a bike,driving, swimming or walking. It is impossible to verbally describe all theknowledge necessary to ride a bike – you can guide a person, but ultimately thenew learner will just have to get on a bike and have a go. They need toestablish their own implicit memories for the various muscle movements, balancechallenges and visual skills necessary to accomplish this complex activity.Implicit memories are built subconsciously and quietly support our activities aswe go about daily life.These different memory systems may be partly distinct but they also overlap andinteract. The majority of semantic memories require the initial input of anepisodic memory. Implicit memories can also begin life as a series of facts andevents that are very fresh in our minds and that then gradually melt away intoimplicit memories as they no longer require conscious access or attention.Anyone who has learned a skill will recognise this process of going fromlaborious, focused thought to much more effortless and automatic skill. Thememory systems that I have described are therefore not separate ‘storage boxes’in our minds but intertwined processes that play different roles depending onthe task we are trying to accomplish or the problem we are trying to solve. Theyare part of a larger network that functions together to allow us to understandand learn about the world around us.In this chapter I will take you on a journey through musical memory, and inparticular through the more extreme manifestations of our tendency to remember,forget, and be chased around by our musical past. By looking at the unusual andoften less understood features of musical memory, the exceptional cases of skilland loss, we gain a unique perspective and understanding of the more everydayinteractions that we all experience with our musical minds.In three tales we will now explore musical memory: I call these tales ‘thestar’, ‘the survivor’ and ‘the miscreant’.‘The star’ – expert musiciansMusicians face a unique challenge if they want to make it as a world-classperformer. For the last 200 years or so, the fashion has been to play frommemory in concert. This is not true of all kinds of music performances but it istypified most strongly in the virtuoso style, where ‘the star’ musician aims todisplay their skill on the stage. You will even see performance from memoryfeatured in competitions for young musicians nowadays, and I recall from myteaching days that there were more points available to exam candidates who couldplay their pieces from memory.I will confess now: as a performer, my musical memory is pretty terrible. Inever encouraged my students to play from memory, preferring them to have thescore available just in case they suddenly went blank. This preference no doubtsprang from my own experience; I never performed from memory. Quite apart frommy stage fright, which meant my public performances were few and far between, Iwas always a visual musician. When I think of music or attempt to play frommemory I see the notes, the score, rolling in front of my eyes. Over time Iconvinced myself that some people were naturally good at playing from memory andthat I was simply not one of them.My assumption seemed to be supported when later in life I went to judge musiccompetitions and saw candidates playing from memory. It all looked so effortless… and completely impossible. Then there are the tales of music memory experts.In particular there is the often-told story of the early 20thcentury conductorArturo Toscanini, which goes something like this:Just before the start of a big concert, an agitated musician from the orchestrahurried up to Toscanini, who was waiting for his cue to go on stage. Thedesperate musician reported to his conductor that the key for the lowest note onhis bassoon was broken beyond repair and at such short notice, nothing could bedone – surely he could not play in the concert? Toscanini sighed, shaded hiseyes with his hand, thought for a moment, and replied: ‘It’s all right – thatnote does not occur in tonight’s concert.’Not only did Toscanini apparently know every note for every orchestralinstrument in that concert (probably around 70 musicians and at least two hoursof music), but it has been estimated that he knew by heart every note for everyinstrument of about 250 symphonies, the words and music for 100 operas, plusvolumes of chamber music, piano, cello and violin music, and songs. How on earthis a memory feat like that possible?I only learned later in life, once I began my PhD, that musical memory is askill, not a gift, one that develops with practice and that relies on the typesof techniques that just about any memory expert will use, adapted for musicalpurposes.Memory experts exist in all walks of life and the World Memory Championship isthe largest gathering of such individuals. The World Memory Championshipscontain many different disciplines revolving around tasks such as rememberingimages, numbers, poems, dates, or packs of cards.3 [part0017.html#c7fn3]In order to attain grand master status a person must: 1) memorise the order of520 randomly shuffled cards (ten complete packs) in one hour; 2) memorise 1,000random numbers in one hour; 3) remember the order of a randomly shuffled singledeck of 52 cards in two minutes or less. Sounds utterly impossible. However, asof September 2013 there were 133 memory grand masters from eighteen countries.4[part0017.html#c7fn4]What all these grand masters of memory and expert musicians have in common is agreat deal of hard work in developing strategies – mnemonics – to help themexpand the basic performance ability of their memory, which is really nodifferent to yours or mine. Memory is not a muscle, you can’t just work it andit will get bigger. Memory is more like a bag of tools, and you can accomplishjust about anything if you put in the time and effort to learn how to use yourtools well.LearningThe first group of important mnemonic techniques is based on learning tomanipulate the information as it is being learned, at the point of encoding.Good memory is as much about how the information goes in as how you attempt toget it out again.The first important encoding strategy for any memory expert is to reduceapparently large bits of information to smaller bite-size chunks. The task ofbreaking information down is called chunking (no, really) and memory expertsachieve this by creating links between smaller bits of information, packing themtogether, and then attempting to remember these more meaningful chunks asopposed to their component parts.A memory expert who wants to remember a shuffled pack of cards might representeach of the cards as a meaningful character, an object or a location, as opposedto an abstract card. They will then create stories or journeys involving thesecharacters, objects and so on, thereby linking them together in their mind.Eventually all they have to know in order to recall the whole pack of cards isone story, as opposed to all the items from which the story was created.A musical memory expert, by the same token, will not try to remember every note.Before they even play or sing a note they will study the musical score andidentify points where larger melodies or movements in the music fuse intomeaningful chunks. They then focus on remembering these large sections of themusic as one.5 [part0017.html#c7fn5]An expert musician will use their long-term knowledge of music, of scales,arpeggios, cadences and harmonic relations, to give meaningful forms to largesections of the music6 [part0017.html#c7fn6]. This process of analysis has beenfound to benefit final performance7 [part0017.html#c7fn7] and has been studiedin both classical8 [part0017.html#c7fn8] and jazz performers9[part0017.html#c7fn9] to date.Musicians see meaning and structure in music naturally, without any instructionto do so. Even I recognise the consequences of subconsciously structuring musicin this way. An example would be when my guitar teacher would point to my musicand say, ‘Can you please begin here?’ I would often wince and reply, ‘Well, Ican start about two bars earlier if you like – that would be much easier.’ It iseasier to start in some places compared to others because these places mark thesubconscious boundaries that we create as a consequence of the learning process.My musical memory would be a lot better than it is today if I had got into thehabit of using these meaningful musical structures, creating sections andplaying each section from memory, making each one bigger over time; and thenslowly linking them together so they eventually became one piece, one memory.Studies have closely observed such processes when professional musicians learn anew piece of music and have noted their importance for performance success.10[part0017.html#c7fn10]Retrieving memoriesStructures in musical memory are also important when it comes to the other endof the process, retrieving the information we want. I think of this as a processakin to fishing: somewhere in that deep, dark lake of your mind is a memory thatyou want to get at and the best way to bring in that fish is to use a good rod.For our purposes, this means that we stand the best chance of retrievinginformation from memory if we use a good retrieval structure.Structural bars, the bars where musicians prefer to start and stop, are a key tothe retrieval of music. Musicians practice their structural bars more, onaverage, compared to non-structural bars, reflecting their importance inretrieval.11 [part0017.html#c7fn11] Aaron Williamon12 [part0017.html#c7fn12]from the Royal College of Music (UK) was the first to show that you can see theconsequences of using retrieval structures in music, by looking at the way thata musician’s brain reacts to viewing music.Williamon asked six musicians to learn the Prelude in A Minor from J.S. Bach’sWell Tempered Clavier II (BWV 889). Once they had learned the piece, they wereasked to identify bars in the music that they considered to be structural. Thefollowing task was visual recognition: the musicians were shown several bars andasked to say if they were from the prelude or not. During the task, theresearchers measured brain responses using an electroencephalogram or EEG.Overall, the musicians were faster at correctly identifying structural barscompared to non-structural bars, indicating that these more important parts ofthe music were easier to spot. Not only this, but the identification ofstructural bars was associated with a unique pattern of brain activity, anexaggerated negative peak in the electrical signal at around 300–400milliseconds after the bar was shown, emerging from the right-central area ofthe brain. This type of pattern is associated with the retrieval of complex,meaningful structures. This result may therefore be the first indicator of aretrieval structure in the musical mind.Once a performer has chunked their music into meaningful units and createdreliable retrieval structures, the next and final step is simple: practice,practice and more practice.The aim of practice once a piece is learned is to speed up recall; to automatisethe memory. By this method a musician will activate the implicit memory system,as we do in many other everyday activities such as learning to ride a bike ordrive a car. Over time and with practice, a once-complex conscious activity nolonger requires quite so much thought. This transformation from high- tolow-attention memory processing is especially important for musical expertisebecause of the high level of demand made on skilled motor coordination duringperformance.Eventually, recalling a large piece of music should feel relatively effortless,and it is at this point that a performer really becomes flexible and skilledwith the demands of performance itself. Once the notes can be retrieved, in theright order, then the musician can focus almost entirely on the fine art ofmusical communication, the nuances of an emotional performance.‘The star’ – all of usAmazing musical memory is not just the preserve of worldclass performers. Mymusical memory as a performer may be poor but there is nothing wrong with mymemory for 1960s Motown, the Beatles’ back catalogue, or Beethoven’s symphonies.I can play them all in my head anytime, anywhere.When I tell people that I study musical memory they often ask me why they havesuch a great memory for music and lyrics but can’t remember important dates orall the items on their shopping list. What makes musical memory so powerful bycomparison?Let’s start by blowing this illusion apart. Our memory for music on firsthearing it is pretty terrible. Andrea Halpern and Daniel Müllensiefen13[part0017.html#c7fn13] presented 63 undergraduate students with 40 unfamiliarshort tunes. They then tested memory for these new tunes when they were buriedamong 80 test tunes. Memory performance across the undergraduates was onlybarely above chance; this was a difficult task.Changing the instrument during the test made memory judgements even worse,indicating how fragile and shaky our first memories for new music can be. Thisresult also suggests that when we first hear music we are particularly attractedto the ‘surface’ features, the nature of the actual sound or speed, and pay lessattention to the deeper structures, harmonies and/or rhythms that are present.To give you an idea of how poor this level of memory performance really is, wecan compare it to our memory for photos. In 1973 Lionel Standing14[part0017.html#c7fn14] presented volunteers with a collection of up to 10,000novel photographs. He was hoping to demonstrate the limits of the long-termmemory system and you would assume that with a maximum of 10,000 images he hadgone rather overboard. In fact, he found an amazing level of performance anddemonstrated that our memory for images is far superior compared to memory forwords. People who were shown all 10,000 new images were estimated to haveretained 6,600 when tested only two days later.How do we reconcile our poor initial memory for new music against the impressionthat we all have large and accurate musical libraries in our heads, filed withthousands of tunes, songs and instrumental pieces?Research carried out on our long-term musical memories says we are right to havefaith in our mental musical store. When we test recall of familiar and favouritemusic we see evidence for the amazing speed and accuracy of musical memory, evenin individuals who have not had a single day of musical training.Daniel Levitin15 [part0017.html#c7fn15] asked volunteers to select a favouritepiece of music from a large collection of CDs that he had in his lab. Once thevolunteers had selected their favourite track they were asked to have a go atsinging it. Levitin recorded their performance and measured it for accuracyagainst the original CD. The majority of people demonstrated ‘absolute memory’for their favourite recording, meaning that they were able to reproduce thefirst pitch of the track within a very small margin of error.What is more, this finding has recently been well replicated across sixdifferent European labs.16 [part0017.html#c7fn16] On average singers producedtheir favourite tracks a little flat, but the majority were able to either hitthe exact right note of a favourite pop song or at least get within a semitone.Overall, it appears that our memory for our favourite music is very good.So how do we go from a shaky impression of new music to an almost accurateblueprint of our favourite pieces in memory? The keys are time and exposure. Togo back to the comparison of memory for new music with that for photographs, thedifference is that music is complex, multi-layered and evolves over time. Thereis just so much more to absorb on the first listen than there is to see in aphotograph.When we first hear a piece of music we are attracted to the surface features ofthe sound, the qualities of the singer’s voice and the timbres of all thedifferent instruments. We are easily distracted by musical ‘surprises’, such aschanges in key or tempo. It is the equivalent of being a kid in a large andexciting sweet shop – so much to enjoy but where to begin and what to try first?Studies by Jay Dowling and colleagues17 [part0017.html#c7fn17] have shown howour memory for music develops over time after this first rush of listeningexcitement. Imagine this process as similar to that which happens when a houseis built. Over the first few exposures to new music we put in the foundations ofour house and create the skeleton structure: we build an idea of key (major orminor, and how these fluctuate) and the contour, the ups and downs of the tune.Over time, and with more exposure, we begin to add the bricks and windows to ourhouse: we add in musical details such as the exact pitches, the differentinstruments. Finally we add the furnishings: the micro-variations in performancesuch as the accent of the singer or minute changes to tempo and volume.It takes a lot of time and exposure to build a good musical memory but once itis built, like any well-built house, it is strong and long lasting. And unlikebuilding a house, there is almost no effort required on the part of thelistener. Your mind does the work for you; all you need to do is to listen.Boosting musical memoryWe remember the music that we hear in different ways. Some pieces of music takelonger (i.e. more exposures) to learn well whereas some appear to burythemselves in our memory relatively quickly. One factor that influences thespeed and accuracy with which we remember new music is personal preference.It makes sense that we might better remember what we perceive to be ‘good music’compared to ‘bad music’, because memory and emotion have strong links in ourminds. The music we like is more arousing, meaning that we experience greaterattention capture and engagement, which is then associated with better memory.Positive mood is also associated with better memory for novel music compared tonegative mood.Stephanie Stalinski and Glenn Schellenberg18 [part0017.html#c7fn18] demonstratedthe power of the relationship between musical memory and liking. Fifty-fivevolunteers rated how much they liked 24 novel musical extracts that each lastedaround fifteen seconds. There was then a ten-minute break wherein they filledout questionnaires, followed by a memory test where each person heard 48 piecesof music, 24 from the first phase of the experiment and 24 which were new butsimilar to the first set. Each person decided whether a musical clip wascompletely new or something that they had heard before.The results were clear. Despite our pretty poor memory for novel music, thepeople in this study could remember enough of the short tunes for theresearchers to be able to assess the impact of liking. Musical clips that wereliked were remembered significantly better than tunes that were rated as neutralor disliked.The researchers went further. They wondered what would happen if they tried alonger delay, which is more like what would happen in the real world. They trieda 24-hour delay and found the same result: liked music was remembered better.The effect also held when they tried different listening situations, and evenwhen they told people of the upcoming memory test and asked them to try toremember the music by creating visual memories while listening.Over time it makes sense that we remember music that we like, as we will clearlychoose to listen to this music more often. This research, however, demonstratesthat the impact of our initial reaction to music has a measurable effect on howwell we remember what we hear after only one listen.We also remember vocal music better than non-vocal music. Michael Weiss andcolleagues reasoned that we may be more attuned to remember vocal music ascompared to instrumental sounds as vocalisations are more biologicallysignificant to us as humans.19 [part0017.html#c7fn19] They tested people’smemory for melodies that were either sung or played on various instruments, bothfamiliar (piano) and less familiar (marimba, banjo).The researchers chose 32 unfamiliar folk tunes from the UK and Ireland for theirstudy, which took place in Canada. The short melodies were sung by a femalevocalist, who performed all the notes on the syllable ‘la’. The researchers thengenerated instrumental versions of the vocal version that were perfectly matchedin pitch, duration and amplitude. Each participant listened to sixteen of themelodies, four in each type of sound, followed by a questionnaire break andfinally a memory test.Memory was better for the vocal melodies compared to any of the otherinstruments, which did not differ from each other. Piano sounds were no betterremembered than the marimba so we can rule out a simple effect of soundfamiliarity. The authors reasoned that, similar to liking, vocal music maystimulate higher arousal and attention engagement in listeners, an effect thatmay be driven by a biological propensity to be attracted to the human voice overmusical instruments.All the experiments in the last section demonstrate that multiple factorsinfluence how well we remember new music, and no doubt there are many influencesyet to be discovered and documented. All the factors, including our likingresponse and apparent attraction to vocal music, contribute to the eventuallaying down of strong and long-lasting musical memories.Name that tune – in 400 milliseconds or lessI keep saying that musical memories are super strong but where is the evidence?One indicator of the power of musical memory is the ‘plink study’. CarolKrumhansl20 [part0017.html#c7fn20] investigated the processes underlying musicalmemory by presenting people with the smallest examples of music that you canimagine; 300 and 400 millisecond ‘plinks’. If you go to your favourite musicplayer and play a piece for just one second then you will appreciate how littleyou really hear in a plink of around a third of that time.Krumhansl played people plinks of music from the 1960s through to the 2000s andasked them to name the artist and the title as well as the decade of release,style (a broader and more reliable category than genre), and the emotionalcontent. Sounds impossible, right?The volunteers in Krumhansl’s study had a good amount of musical training(around ten years) and were reasonably avid music listeners (an average ofaround 20 hours a week), but they were young adults and certainly notexperienced musicians or music writers/critics. They listened to 28 musicalplinks in total, chosen from top songs in lists by Rolling Stone, Billboard andBlender. Nearly 30 per cent of the participants claimed to be able to recognisethe songs after hearing only a 400-millisecond plink, and of this group 95 percent correctly identified the title and artist.The best recognised plinks were Britney Spears’ ‘Baby One More Time’ and ArethaFranklin’s ‘Respect’. Also high in the recognition ratings were The Police’s‘Every Breath You Take’ and John Lennon’s ‘Imagine’. At the lower end were LouisArmstrong’s ‘Wonderful World’, Coldplay’s ‘Viva La Vida’ and U2’s ‘BeautifulDay’.The volunteers who spotted the plinks were also good at identifying the releasedecade, suggesting that this information is recalled or inferred quickly alongwith the title and artist. Even when people were not able to spot the songs theywere often able to identify emotional content and style. Krumhansl then tried asimilar experiment with 300-millisecond plinks. As expected, accuracy went downbut remained above 10 per cent.Overall, the plink study shows that memory for wellknown music is incrediblydetailed and reliable; a miniscule extract can trigger recall of the whole songto the extent that people can identify the artist and title, and decade ofrelease. The fact that emotional judgements and style were not always so tightlylinked to correct identification tells us that these aspects of musical memorymay be stored differently in our minds.Interestingly, there was also a preference for older songs in the study, fromthe 1960s and 1970s, even though the participants were young adults. This resultcould be interpreted as an impact of more distinctive styles and recordingtechniques on memory; a ‘uniqueness effect’. Or maybe songs from that era wereassociated with more iconic representations of history that were stronger ingeneral episodic and semantic memory. Possibly there was an increase of exposureeffect on memory, with the young adults having heard the music of their parentsfor longer than their own.Or perhaps, as Krumhansl puts it, ‘it may be better music’: an interesting and,to my mind, not entirely fruitless argument.Finally, Krumhansl used her study as a basis for estimating the capacity ofmusical memory. If you listen to twenty hours of music a week (like hervolunteers) then you will hear an average of 22,000 songs every year (based onabout three minutes’ length each). Although that includes many repetitions it isstill reasonable to assume that an average memory for a listener of thisfrequency would extend to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, ofidentifiable memorised pieces of music over a lifetime.It’s a musical lifeAnother indicator of the power in musical memory is its longevity. David Rubinwrote about oral traditions21 [part0017.html#c7fn21]; how many folk, children’sand tribal songs have remained in human culture for hundreds if not thousands ofyears without ever being written down. It appears that music can surviveperfectly well relying only on human memory over countless generations.Musical memory also survives well over the course of a single human lifetime. Mygrandma is an example of someone with an excellent and longstanding musicalmemory. She loves to sing and will very often come out with a tune just becauseyou utter a phrase that reminds her of a song. She has a particularly goodmemory for songs she heard as a child or young woman, a feature of generalmemory called the reminiscence bump.Studies have shown, in fact, that older listeners retain many important musicmemory skills such as the ability to recognise alterations to melodies, eventhough performance is slowed slightly in line with theories of cognitiveageing.22 [part0017.html#c7fn22] And as we shall see more in the next chapter,the music that provides comfort and stimulates memory most effectively in olderpeople is most commonly the music that has been in their memory for the longesttime, from their reminiscence bump.23 [part0017.html#c7fn23]The fact that music memory lasts well for a lifetime is the basis for thepopular radio format where a well-known individual tells the story of their lifethrough their favourite music, for example the BBC Radio 4 programme, DesertIsland Discs. Listening to an individual’s memories told partly through theirmusical choices provides a unique insight into a person’s experiences but alsotheir personality and outlook. Over our lifetimes, music becomes a part of whowe are because it interweaves so well with our episodic memories for events andpeople.In this section we have seen some of the true capabilities of musical memory. Itmay not be the most reliable memory system when it first hears a piece of musicbut, given time, it can build durable and long-lasting musical memories thateasily mix with our life experiences to become a central part of who we are aspeople. In the next section I will look at the power of musical memory from arelated angle: its ability to survive.‘The Survivor’To anyone who has cared for an elderly individual it will come as no surprisethat musical memory can often survive when other aspects of memory begin tofade. I have heard many heartwarming stories of individuals withdementia-related illnesses or Alzheimer’s who find comfort in music and who mayeven manage to retrieve memories in its presence that otherwise appear to belost.A favourite anecdote that has stayed with me for a while (such that I cannotrecall the source, I am afraid) was of a gentleman in a care home who had becomelargely immobile and very quiet. Most of the time he sat in his chair or lay inbed simply staring: it had been a while since any of the staff could rememberhim engaging in conversation. The man valued his privacy and preferred the doorto his room to be closed during the day. The nurses were happy to oblige hiswishes; they would always knock before entering and wait for his permission toenter.One day the staff nurse became worried as the man did not respond when sheknocked on his door. She tried once, twice, three times. No luck. At this pointshe decided to go in and make sure he was okay. She was greeted by the sight ofhim dancing round the room and singing to ‘Rock Around the Clock’ by Bill Haleyand His Comets. Apparently a cleaner had left their radio in his room byaccident during morning rounds.From then onwards the nurses made sure that the man had access to music that heliked. He was still a quiet man but the music often put a smile on his face andencouraged him to chat more with residents and staff. A small differenceperhaps, but a positive effect nonetheless.At this point I would like to make it clear that music is no ‘magic bullet’ orcure for memory loss. Some individuals will never respond to music and othersmay prefer silence. The point rather is that musical memory can often surviveeven in extreme cases and can therefore be a method by which to reach someonewho has suffered memory loss.Perhaps the most compelling case of musical memory survival is that of CliveWearing. In the early to mid-1980s Clive was reaching a high point in his careeras a musicologist, keyboardist, singer and conductor. He was the choirmaster ofthe London Sinfonietta and director of the London Lassus Ensemble. He was awell-respected researcher and expert in early/Renaissance music and was giventhe prestigious role of managing the music for BBC Radio 3, a UK classicalstation, on the day Prince Charles wed Princess Diana. Clive was himself newlymarried to his second wife Deborah.According to reports, sometime in March 1985 Clive fell ill with a headache andflu-like symptoms. His doctor prescribed painkillers and advised him to rest.His symptoms rapidly worsened and he was found wandering the streets in aconfused state. He was taken to hospital where he began to experience seizuresand fell into a coma. A brain scan revealed the terrible truth: Clive hadcontracted herpes simplex encephalitis, a rare but severe virus that attacks thecentral nervous system from within the brain.While in a coma, Clive’s brain swelled with infection and was crushed againsthis skull. For most people this condition is fatal, so doctors were pleasantlysurprised when Clive awoke from his coma. However, it quickly became apparentthat all was not well. Clive remained confused and did not seem to rememberanything about his life. Such confusion is not unusual after a prolonged periodof unconsciousness but Clive did not show any signs of recovery as the weeks andmonths went by. His wife Deborah has said since that ‘the virus caused a hole inhis brain and all the memories fell out’.The swelling in Clive’s brain had deprived several vital neural structures ofoxygen and the cells had subsequently died. The most severe damage was withinthe frontal lobe and the brain areas that support memory function. Like manywith frontal lobe damage, Clive’s personality changed and he experiences wavesof emotion and anxiety that he is unable to control. Unlike most people,however, Clive has a deep and dense amnesia, or memory loss; arguably the worstcase in medical history.As a result of his illness Clive has lost the majority of his life’s memoriesand is unable to make any new ones. These conditions are known as retrograde andanterograde amnesia, respectively. In reality this means Clive has little to noidea of his past or conception of the future. He is stuck in a time window of afew seconds – the present moment. You can ask him a question but by the time hegets a few sentences into his answer he will have forgotten what you said. Thatis the length of his memory span.Two things seem to have survived this dreadful destruction, nearly 30 years on:Clive’s love for his wife Deborah, and his music. There have been a fewdocumentaries of Clive over the years and if you watch one you will see that hegreets Deborah with joy and rapture whenever she walks into a room, as if he hasnot seen her for years, even if she has just stepped out to make tea. And Clivestill enjoys playing the piano.The videos I have seen show Clive playing from a musical score, so even thoughhe may not be able to play from memory any more (no one has ever confirmed to methat he can) he retains the memory of how to sight read music. He also playswith emotional inflection, showing that some of the techniques he once learnedabout the art of musical performance remain with him: all this despite having noepisodic memories of his musical training or his illustrious and successfulmusical career.Clive may be an extreme case of memory loss but he is not alone. In 2012 CarstenFinke and collagues24 [part0017.html#c7fn24] reported the case of an amnesiccellist. The German patient, known only as ‘PM’, suffered from the same rareillness as Clive and also had severe damage to his memory. His doctors had noidea that he could still remember music until he was spotted playing his celloat home by neighbours. PM had not wanted to play for anyone since his recovery:he felt he was no longer very good. This fact alone suggests that PM had somememory, deep down, for his previous musical abilities.Spurred on by this discovery, the doctors carried out tests on PM’s musicalmemory to see which elements may have survived. They played him two pieces ofmusic at a time and asked him which he recognised. One of the two pieces wasalways a well-known concerto or sonata that he would have heard before hisillness, such as the first movement from Mendelssohn’s Violin Concerto in Eminor (1843). The other was a more recent piece, similar in style andinstrumentals but composed after his illness, such as the Andante/Reflectionpiece from Max Richter’s Waltz with Bashir soundtrack (2008). PM successfullyidentified 93 per cent of the older pieces of music.The doctors then played PM the new pieces later that same day. Even though hehad no episodic memory of having heard them before, he was able to identify 77per cent. This result suggests that not only has PM retained memories of musicfrom his past but he is also capable of learning new music. This latter abilityhas been described as ‘astonishing’ by his doctors.Finally, just to show that tales of music memory survival are not limited tocases of herpes encephalitis patients, Séverine Samson and her colleagues havereported relatively spared memory for music in two different brain disorders,medically intractable epilepsy and Alzheimer’s, despite both populations havingsevere verbal memory impairments.25 [part0017.html#c7fn25]The burning question is: how and why does musical memory survive in these andother cases of memory loss. Is musical memory special?26 [part0017.html#c7fn26]There are a number of reasons to suspect that the answer to this question is‘yes’. Some of these reasons have to do with the memorable structure of music,which I have already outlined in the section on musical memory as ‘The Star’(page 171). I also believe that musical memories survive because of the way theyare processed in our minds.Firstly, for many people music is a motor skill (as for Clive and PM), likeriding a bike. Not a great deal is known about what happens to memories when askill moves from requiring great demands on our attention and focus (when wefirst learn to walk or drive a car) to being more automatic; from beingconscious to non-conscious. But we do know that memories move from the systemsthat demand heavy resources, episodic and semantic memory, into the morelowdemand implicit memory system.27 [part0017.html#c7fn27] This means that whenmusic becomes a skill, when it becomes a habit, it gains a great deal of powerin the mind in terms of longevity and resistance to decay.For someone who has had a degree of musical training, musical memory alsobecomes partly procedural – a term used to refer to the motor- or movement-basedaspect of memory. Amnesia and other memory disorders are characterised by theloss of conscious memory processes while the implicit procedural memory systemsare, by comparison, spared.28 [part0017.html#c7fn28]Clive and PM may have lost access to the episodic memories of their musiclessons and careers but they do not need to access these conscious memories inorder to be able to play their instruments. The rest of us do not need toremember our childhood cycle lessons in order to be able to ride a bike.Another reason why musical memories survive is again linked to the implicitmemory system but has to do with emotional reactions. Our emotional responses tomusic are often formed through conditioned responses; for example, I am morelikely to have a positive emotional reaction to music in a major key as mymemories of happy music, as a Western tonal music listener, have been mostlylinked to music in the major key. Conditioned emotional responses such as thisalso tend to survive in memory disorders.There are some physical clues in the brain as to why the implicit memory systemsurvives well in extreme cases of memory loss. Emotional reactions are at leastpartly driven by the activity of central brain systems such as the amygdala. Inprevious chapters we discussed how amygdala activation has frequently beenmeasured in response to hearing emotional music.The amygdala, with its central location, has a higher likelihood of survivingbrain damage as compared to an area such as the frontal cortex when it comes tobrain swelling or a blow to the head. Therefore an individual may lose theconscious memories of why a piece of music causes them to feel a certain way(thanks to the destruction of areas around the frontal cortex) but stillexperience the core feeling (thanks to the activity of the amygdala).So, to sum up, apart from the nature of music itself, musical memories surviveat least in part because music activates brain systems that 1) are more likelyto survive the more common types of brain damage, and 2) drive non-conscious andconditioned implicit responses to stimuli, such as motor and emotionalbehaviours. Musical memories really do, in every sense, become part of our innerbeing.‘The Miscreant’So far in this chapter I have talked about the great and good of musical memory;the natural learner and the strong survivor. In the interests of fairness andgiving a balanced view, it is only right that I finish this chapter with adiscussion of the naughty side of musical memory.Ever had a tune stuck in your head? A little ditty or perhaps even a longer songor musical piece that goes round and round in your mind’s ear? If the statisticsare right then over 90 per cent of you should be nodding ‘yes’ at this stage.29[part0017.html#c7fn29] If you have never experienced a tune stuck in your headthen you are in rare company. Some people experience repeating music in theirminds so frequently that they claim to have an almost constant musicalsoundtrack to their daily lives.30 [part0017.html#c7fn30]We currently refer to this phenomenon as involuntary musical imagery, but ineveryday lingo it is most commonly known as an ‘earworm’, a translation of theGerman term Ohrwurm. This experience has had many labels in the past, including‘brain worm’, ‘sticky music’,31 [part0017.html#c7fn31] ‘cognitive itch’32[part0017.html#c7fn32] and ‘stuck song syndrome’.33 [part0017.html#c7fn33] In mylab, day in and day out, we call these stuck tunes earworms, so I will use thatterm from now on. Let’s blow a few false assumptions out of the water first.Fact 1: Earworms are not always annoying. When you first ask people about theirearworms they will often tell you about the experiences or episodes that get ontheir nerves. However, if you look at large population surveys or take diarystudies of people’s reactions at the time of each episode, you find that themajority of earworms are actually not bothersome (rated as ‘neutral’) or areeven enjoyable.34 [part0017.html#c7fn34]In my own research I ask people how they control or try to cure their earworms.I have a sizeable number of responses that say something akin to ‘Why would Iwant to control my earworms? They don’t bother me and sometimes they keep mecompany.’Fact 2: Earworms are not always pop songs or jingles. As much as the advertisingindustry would like to believe that we only get short, catchy tunes stuck in ourheads, I can give you hundreds of examples of people who get complex music stuckin their heads, including classical works, modern jazz and new age music. It istrue to say that the majority of earworms that I have been told about to dateare melodic, vocal and simple, but to deny the existence of other kinds ofearworms would be to ignore important information about the possible causes ofthe experience.Fact 3: Musicians do not get them more often. This is not a closed issue butpresent research suggests that it is not those with the most musical trainingwho experience the most frequent and/or longest episodes of earworms. In factmusicians with the highest levels of training (more than fifteen years) oftenreport fewer earworms than people with less training.35 [part0017.html#c7fn35]Our research has found that people who enjoy music every day, in particularthose who like to sing along, report the most habitual and recurring earworms.36[part0017.html#c7fn36] A nice side effect of this pattern in the data is thatthose people who like a good singsong are also more likely to enjoy theirearworms.A number of studies have tried to identify traits that predict higher risk offrequent or more disturbing earworm experiences. An interesting concept in thisarea is ‘transliminality’. If you are the kind of person who measures high ontransliminality then you are more sensitive to recognising thoughts and feelingsthat originate in the non-conscious mind. Another way to put it is to imaginethat a layer or barrier exists between our conscious and non-conscious mentallife. This barrier is more permeable in people who have high transliminality.Mike Wammes and Imants Barušs reported that individuals who were high intransliminality were more likely to report persistent and distracting earwormscompared to those who scored low on the same dimension.37 [part0017.html#c7fn37]Other studies have reported a link between earworms and neuroticism,38[part0017.html#c7fn38] and between earworms and nonclinical obsessive-compulsivetraits.39 [part0017.html#c7fn39] No doubt other individual factors will emergeover time but it is interesting that at present most of the traits identifiedare marked by a tendency towards rumination, being more likely to focus on andworry about past or present events.Studying the type of people who get earworms is one way of trying to get at thequestion of why they happen. Another way is to explore the circumstances underwhich they appear in daily life. That was the aim of a study of mine in which Ianalysed hundreds of earworm stories about why tunes got stuck in people’sheads.40 [part0017.html#c7fn40] To be clear, only about a quarter of people inthe study claimed to have any idea why a tune was stuck in their head, whichleaves us a lot of unaccounted for earworm episodes.What triggers earworms?When people were able to describe the circumstances of their earworm they mostoften described recent and repeated exposure to the tune that was stuck in theirhead. This finding aligns with Oliver Sacks’ idea that the preponderance ofeasily accessible music in the modern world is at least partly to blame for thefrequency of earworms.But the prevalence of modern music can’t be the whole story; we know thatearworms were a well-known phenomenon long before the modern age of ubiquitousrecorded music. In 1876 Mark Twain wrote a short story entitled ‘A LiteraryNightmare’, in which he describes a jingle getting stuck in his head anddisrupting his concentration level so much that he is forced to pass it on tosomeone else in order to get rid of the experience.Another common trigger of earworms, one that has nothing to do with hearingmusic, is the activity of involuntary memory. To give an example, one of thepeople in my study described seeing a licence plate that reminded her of thetitle of a Michael Jackson song (‘PYT’), and for the rest of the day that tunewas stuck in her head, even though she had not heard it for a long time.We are a long way from understanding why memory ‘pops’ in this way betweenthoughts41 [part0017.html#c7fn41] – between things we see and hear in the worldand related images or sounds in our minds.42 [part0017.html#c7fn42] Fromfindings like the Michael Jackson story above, however, we can see that mindpopping is a strong trigger for earworms. Short of sitting in a dark room withnothing to see or hear, there is little we can do to control this type of mentalactivity. Mind popping appears to be a natural consequence of the way ourmemories operate, and as long as music is held in our memory then there is achance that it will be triggered by a random encounter with something thatreminds us of its contents.It is also possible that emotional conditioned responses may be behind some ofour earworm experiences. In my survey, some respondents reported that theyalways experienced the same earworm in response to certain moods orcircumstances. In my case, when I am happy I often have Doris Day singing alively rendition of ‘The Deadwood Stage’ in my head. It always makes me smile.Future research will help us untangle other possible causes of earworms,including the prospect that some earworms may help to modify our state ofattention or mood for the task at hand. It is a nice thought that the mind maybe selecting tunes from our mental jukebox in order to support our activities inthe same way that we ourselves might select a tune to boost our confidencebefore a night out or calm us down after an argument.One thing we have little idea about as yet is the repeating, looping componentof earworms. Why do they get stuck? Again, earworms are not the only type ofthought to loop in the mind. Worries or rumination can also be cyclic,especially in times of stress. I have often heard people speak about other typesof repeating sounds, such as words from poems, prayers or even jokes. The greatthing about earworms is that because they are so regular and common compared tothese other kinds of mental activity, they are a useful research tool that mayhelp us better understand other types of repeating thoughts in the future.music [../images/00002.jpeg]Memory is so much more than a collection of stories, skills and ideas. As wehave seen in this chapter, memory is vital to learning, whether we are trainingas a musician or simply learning about the music of our culture through everydaylistening. It is an essential component of our experience of consciousness thatkeeps us connected to our past and future on the thin sliver of time that wethink of as the present moment. Memory can also be involuntary, it can ‘pop’ andrepeat on us for reasons we do not yet fully understand.In all these three guises, ‘the star’, ‘the survivor’ and ‘the miscreant’,musical memory has shown itself to be crucial to our understanding of ourmusical world and also to our understanding of what we believe, what we havebeen through in our life, and how we came to be who we are today.In the next chapter we will see how musical memory is also an importantingredient in the potential of music to provide comfort and to support healingin times of illness and injury. In the final part of our musical life journey Iwill discuss the various ways in which music has been found to have a positiveimpact on our health and state of well-being."},{"pageContent":"Chapter 8Music and lifelong well-being‘One good thing about music; when it hits you, you feel no pain.’BOB MARLEYThroughout this book there have been countless points where I could havediscussed how music can help to alleviate or remediate mental and physicalconditions. Music has the potential to provide valuable and powerful support forwell-being across the whole of the lifespan, from infancy right through toend-of-life care. In the end I decided not to bury these interesting ideas amongthe chapters but to bring them into a light of their own.Before beginning down the road of exploring music for lifelong well-being, Iwant to make a few things clear. Firstly, and most importantly, music is not acure-all for everything that ails us in life. If it was then someone would havenoticed by now.In 2005 John Sloboda1 [part0017.html#c8fn1] wrote a wise cautionary note warningagainst the ‘vitamin’ model of music. This refers to the danger we evoke whenexpecting that certain music will have the same impact on everyone; the ideathat music might be prescribed in tones, rhythms and timbres depending on theway you want to feel or for a particular health-related outcome. ‘This is thebest music for heart disease’; ‘this is best for depression’; ‘this is betterfor sleeping’, and so on. To go down this road, given the individualistic natureof our musical skills, preferences and memories, is foolhardy.You may see echoes of this kind of ‘pharmaceutical’ approach to music andwell-being in some of the studies in this chapter. This is not a terrible thing,as demonstrating the potential power of music for well-being was an importantearly step for supporting future work and interest in this area. What isimportant now is where we go from here.Similarly, I do not believe that music should be treated as a whole, somethingwe use under one generic label. Music is the most wonderfully diverse humanactivity, full of different styles, instruments, voices and performancetraditions. We need to honour this variety. We are only at the very beginning ofunderstanding how music relates to health and well-being outside Westerncultures, although efforts are being made to highlight this gap in our knowledgeparticularly by the fields of medical ethnomusicology and culturalanthropology.2 [part0017.html#c8fn2]Finally, I make one pre-emptive observation that will become clear to you as Idescribe studies of music and wellbeing. As yet, we have only rough ideas of howmusic contributes to positive health outcomes. Much of what you will read orhear on this subject is speculation. Many researchers are still operatinglargely on intuition when engaging with the therapeutic impacts of music. It isearly days for science in this area and we are finding our way. Once again, ahope for the future is that we can move towards isolating some of the mechanismsbehind positive outcomes so that we can move from intuitive to more informedengagement with music for well-being.In this chapter I am first going to talk about ways in which music can bringabout positive impacts for lifelong well-being, and outline the kind ofmechanisms that are currently the hot contenders for explaining positiveeffects. Then we will look at the different ways that people are engaging withmusic for well-being and the important differences between music therapy andmusic medicine.Once all these concepts are settled in place I will move on to the researchitself, spanning as it does the whole of the human lifespan: a selection of someof the most interesting studies to date, showing how music can support growth inbabies and children, boost communication and support language development, aidmovement, calm distress, and play a role in how the brain repairs itself afterillness or injury.As humans we have spent thousands of years developing, expanding and refiningthis amazing tool and ability that we call music, without any real drive orpurpose other than the pleasure and passion that we feel as a result. That samemusic is now beginning to reveal its power to help us along our life’s journey.music [../images/00002.jpeg]I have thought carefully about the term to use when talking about the ways inwhich we engage with music for non-music related benefits. After a few falsestarts I decided that ‘wellbeing’ suited best.Well-being does not have one single definition since the word is used acrossmultiple disciplines including but not limited to medicine, economics, politics,social studies and psychology; it is no wonder that we can’t all agree. Mypreferred shorthand description though comes from an economic background: ‘doingwell – feeling good’.3 [part0017.html#c8fn3]The ‘doing well’ part of well-being refers to objective standard of living. Itmay seem like this refers only to economic prosperity but you can think of itmore widely as what a person can or can’t do well in their everyday life: forexample, whether a person is mobile enough to work and take care of themselvesor whether they can communicate well enough to take part in activities withfamily and friends.The ‘feeling good’ part of well-being refers to our subjective level of lifesatisfaction, given our personal circumstances. Feeling good is also about oursense of social identity, as personal reflection on how we may feel is comparedto values and expectations, given our society and background, and to ourperception of the people around us.When we talk about music and well-being, therefore, we must think beyond theinstant ‘feel good factor’ that we encounter when we play a bit of music tocheer us up after a long day and instead consider the widest possible well-beingoutreach of any music-related intervention.Having set my net so wide, I now have to admit that there is no way that I coulddiscuss all the well-being-related studies of music that exist. There areexcellent texts devoted to this subject alone that far exceed the size of thisbook.4 [part0017.html#c8fn4] My aim in using such a wide definition ofwell-being is to give myself enough wiggle room to touch on as many differentstudies of lifelong well-being as possible, to give you a broad flavour of theareas in which we are starting to see potential for music.Music therapy and music medicineI attended a very inspiring conference a few years ago in Austria, entitled‘Mozart and Science’. These were my first steps into the world of music andwell-being research, and marked my first interactions with music therapists.Apart from a head full of ideas and motivation, this conference left me with oneoverriding impression: that music therapy and music medicine were two differentthings that should not be confused. I still think this is an important conceptto emphasise.We all use music in ways we may think of as ‘therapeutic’ when we need cheeringup, consolation, support or comfort. What we do in these circumstances, however,would not be classed as music therapy in a strict sense. Definitions of musictherapy vary but they all come down to a situation where ‘the therapist helpsthe client to promote health, using music experiences and the relationshipsdeveloping through them’.5 [part0017.html#c8fn5] Music listening can be a partof music therapy but they are not the same thing. Music therapy needs thepresence of a qualified therapist.6 [part0017.html#c8fn6]I have had the privilege to observe a handful of music therapy sessions over theyears in various situations, from a nursing home to neurological care and at aschool for severely disabled children. I can say from this small experience thatthe presence of the therapist, as a guide, a focus and a source of connectionfor the client, was absolutely essential.There are aspects of the human interaction in music therapy that we willprobably never be able to quantify with scientific studies and I can thereforefully sympathise with practitioners who may be reluctant to engage with researchon therapy. However, I believe that we should at least try to understand some ofthe mechanisms behind the effects of music therapy: by doing so we can learnmore about the kinds of techniques and activities that are effective fordifferent patients. Certainly at the conference I was attending there wereplenty of therapists who were keen to explore the physiological andpsychological mechanisms that may underpin their important work in order to makesure their approaches were as informed and as effective as possible for theirclients.Having defined music therapy, we are left with a large body of research withouta name: studies where music was used with the aim of improving a condition orsituation but where no therapist was present. If a researcher uses music forhealth-related outcomes in the absence of a therapist then we can use the term‘music medicine’.There are many advantages to considering music therapy and music medicine asoptions in care plans. At safe hearing levels there are no reported negativeside effects to music. Music interventions can be planned in combination withjust about any other form of therapy or medication without fear of negativeinteraction effects. In addition, many music interventions do not require verbalcommunication, which makes them ideal for patients whose speech is impaired orabsent. Music therapy and music medicine can also be viewed as overall costeffective: with their use, patients can often be discharged sooner, use lessmedication, and require less intensive staff care.7 [part0017.html#c8fn7]How does it work?Setting aside the differences between music medicine and music therapy, howmight listening to music impact on our state of well-being?Music has a varied list of measurable effects on our physical and psychologicalstate that we have touched on throughout the book, relating to our emotions,moods, memories, attentional focus, and mental and physical arousal. One or twoof these mechanisms deserve an additional special mention here.Perhaps the most cited reaction to music that is associated with improvedwell-being is the relaxation response of the autonomic nervous system, whichincludes a variety of body markers such as the lowering of heart rate, breathingrate, blood pressure, muscular tension and oxygen consumption.There are many beneficial secondary effects to this autonomic relaxationresponse, including the reduction of pain,8 [part0017.html#c8fn8] anxiety andstress. These combined outcomes can lead to positive effects in medicalsituations: for example, studies at Yale found that spinal surgery patients whocould control their own pain medication used up to 43 per cent less when theyhad access to their favourite music.9 [part0017.html#c8fn9]A second mechanism of effect for music and well-being are brain responses to ourfavourite music, in particular the release of neurotransmitters (for example,dopamine) that are associated with psychological experiences like motivation andpleasure. Hearing favourite music is associated with the activity ofneurotransmitters in the brain’s reward circuitry: deep connections between thelimbic emotion centres of the brain and the higher pre-frontal decision-makingand evaluation areas.10 [part0017.html#c8fn10] The latest research indicatesthat even brand new music can stimulate aspects of this brain reward circuitry,if that new music comes from a style or genre that we already enjoy.11[part0017.html#c8fn11]The autonomic relaxation response, combined with the activity of the brainreward system, impacts on our hormone and immune response. The body producesnatural opiates in response to our listening to enjoyable music and often we cansee a marked reduction in levels of cortisol, a marker of a stress response inthe body.12 [part0017.html#c8fn12] Even a single music therapy session has beenassociated with a significant increase in measurable salivary immunoglobulin A,a natural antibody in our immune system.13 [part0017.html#c8fn13]Finally, when we consider the effects of music therapy on well-being we must notforget about the less tangible but very real influences of increased humancontact, communication and empathy, guided reflection and emotional support.As a result of the sheer number of possible explanations for music’s effects onwell-being it is not uncommon for researchers in this area to ascribe a positiveimpact of music to a collection of these mechanisms. The problem is that moststudies have no idea how music leads to a positive effect.I am no different. I have run these kinds of music and well-being studies and asa researcher you get really excited about the fact that music appears to behelping people, but then realise that, apart from a few intriguing leads, thereis no clear reason why.Another problem is that many music and well-being studies are correlational innature; this means that researchers introduce music into an environment (forexample, a hospital, a care home) and then look for changes in behaviour and/orfeelings of the patients/clients/participants. Any changes that the researchersobserve could have come from any number of underlying causes, and probablyemerge from a complex, unique combination of the brain and body mechanisms Ihave listed above.The most comprehensive studies that I will tell you about in the next sectiontake as many brain and body measures as they can to try to narrow down likelymechanisms in the effects observed.Having laid down definitions and cautionary notes, we can now proceed into theresearch itself. I will touch on general well-being in several places in thenext section, which moves in life stages from infancy right the way through toend-of-life care, but I will focus on music medicine and music therapy forbrain, body and behaviour syndromes and developmental issues.Music and well-being in infantsPremature babiesIn Chapter 1 I talked about the development of human hearing in the womb.Sometime between the fourth and sixth month of pregnancy a foetus will developthe physiological structures in the ear and brain that are necessary to perceivesound. When a full-term baby is born it has had months of experience of hearingthe muffled rhythms and melodies of sound that pass into its fluid-filledenvironment. You might think of this as the ‘music of the womb’.Sadly, not all babies reach full term. Happily, medical science has maderemarkable steps when it comes to caring for babies born as young as 22–23weeks, such that many go on to survive. The priority for these premature babiesis to take care of their underdeveloped organs and support their growth tomaturity as far as possible.At a conference called ‘Music and Neurosciences’ in 2011 I first heard about thework of Amir Lahav, director of the Neonatal Research Lab at Brigham and Women’sHospital in Boston, Massachusetts. Lahav had just completed a series of studiesin which he simulated a neonatal hearing environment for premature babies. Whywould he do this? Surely there are more important matters than worrying abouthearing in a premature baby?Consider for a minute the auditory environment inside a neonatal intensive careunit (NICU): quiet but with occasional loud machines bleeping and buzzing,intermittent piercing alarms, medics shouting important, emergency instructions.All that noise constitutes massive overexposure if your tiny ears have only justbegun to process sound.Lahav and his research team reasoned that babies who reach term in the womb geta much gentler and informationrich introduction to sound over several monthsthat helps to develop the fine structures in the ear and the auditory corticesin the brain. Through this early, muffled, music-like exposure, their braindevelops invaluable pattern-recognition and memory skills which will beimportant for later development of speech and language comprehension. Beforethey are even born, babies come to know important rhythms and melodies liketheir mother’s voice, heartbeat and breathing patterns.Lahav decided to try and replace some of this lost opportunity for brain and earsound experience in premature babies by simulating a neonatal sound environmentin their NICU cots. He speculated that recreating, in particular, the maternalspeech that the babies would hear in the womb may also have benefits for thedevelopment of their tiny bodies, by minimising heart and breathing stressresponses.The researchers introduced recordings of mothers’ voices and heartbeats into theNICU environment of fourteen premature babies (born between 26 and 32 weeks) byway of a specially created mini-audio system.14 [part0017.html#c8fn14] Thebabies served as their own control group, as they heard normal hospital soundsas well as maternal sounds. The researchers monitored the number of times babiesexperienced adverse breathing and heart responses and found that these weresignificantly lower when the babies were listening to their mother’s voice andheartbeat.This study does not use ‘music’ in the traditional sense, but remember thatinfants at six months’ gestation would never hear music in the way that we can.They would hear muffled pitch patterns (melodies) and rhythms filtered by thewomb.Exposing premature babies to real music in an NICU also leads to promisingoutcomes according to a two-and-a-halfyear study of eleven different hospitalsites, led by Joanne Loewy. She showed that live music therapy in NICUs (by aqualified therapist, making use of singing and instruments) had measurablebeneficial impacts on babies’ vital signs and sleep patterns.15[part0017.html#c8fn15]Music therapy was a crucial choice in the above study, as a therapist can reactflexibly to changes in a baby’s breathing, heart rate or movement patterns.Positive effects of music have also been seen in the way that premature babiesrespond to necessary but often painful and stressful procedures.16[part0017.html#c8fn16]There is a tendency for clinicians to be concerned – rightly – about thenegative impact of noise in an NICU, including music.17 [part0017.html#c8fn17]But given the presence of predictable structures like melody and rhythm, it isreasonable to hypothesise that soft, simple music that reduces the possibilityfor over-stimulation would be supportive for developing ears as well as mindsand bodies in premature babies, especially when combined with the sounds ofmaternal speech and heartbeats.18 [part0017.html#c8fn18] Guidelines for musicuse in NICUs have been created with this in mind.19 [part0017.html#c8fn19]Another problem for premature babies is feeding. Weight gain is one of the mostimportant factors in healthy premature development but babies born before 34weeks often have pronounced difficulties coordinating sucking, breathing andswallowing. They can be tube fed, though this increases the risk of stressresponses and can stall development of musculature in the gastrointestinalsystem. In short, it is important to encourage a premature baby to learn how tofeed as soon as possible.Work by Jayne Standley20 [part0017.html#c8fn20] established that music can be avaluable tool in helping to encourage premature infants to adapt their suckingreflex to feeding. Standley developed a pacifier that plays recordings ofpleasant female singing when babies suck correctly, which can apparently help tospeed up a baby’s ability to feed independently. The impact of lullabies onfeeding, in combination with more traditional pacifiers, has also been supportedby recent studies,21 [part0017.html#c8fn21] though it has yet to be establishedwhether music helps infants learn how to coordinate their sucking through rhythmor simply encourages them when they happen upon the right technique.The challenges facing a premature infant are great as they fight to survive andgrow outside of the protection of their mother’s womb. This period is astressful time for all and wellchosen music, especially in the hands of atrained therapist, can help foster relaxation that has positive impacts on bodyand brain mechanisms. These effects have secondary benefits for processes suchas sleep and feeding, which all contribute to development.Music and well-being in childrenI only have the space to touch on a few of the areas where music medicine andmusic therapy can help to support wellbeing in children who have been diagnosedwith conditions that impact on their physical and/or mental development. All ofthese conditions also exist in adults but I talk about them here as the majorityof the research has looked at children. In theory there is no reason why thiswork could not be extended to adults in the future: as we know, the brain iscapable of lifelong learning and change (see Chapter 3).Autism spectrumMy beloved nephew Eneko has fragile X syndrome, a genetic syndrome that leads toa number of unique physical and mental characteristics, the latter of whichresemble autistic traits. Eneko is a happy ten-year-old boy who I adore.Although he can barely speak, he is very ticklish, curious, and we laugh all thetime when we play games. Because of his syndrome he can be quickly distressed bychanges to the environment, loud noises or disruptions to his routine. He iscrazy about music, in particular Vivaldi. I once got him a baton so he couldconduct orchestras that he hears on CD or sees on the TV.Music can be an invaluable way to communicate with children like Eneko who showautistic traits and who also may have very limited verbal output. Children onthe autism spectrum can show unique sensitivity to musical sounds22[part0017.html#c8fn22] and at least 12 per cent of autism clinical interventionscurrently feature music-based activities.23 [part0017.html#c8fn23]Music therapy, when compared to play therapy, can result in significantimprovements in non-verbal and gestural communication, including eye contact andturn-taking behaviours.24 [part0017.html#c8fn24] Adding in musical elements tovocal training has also been found to have beneficial impacts on low-functioningautistic children who are learning to speak.25 [part0017.html#c8fn25]A related developmental challenge associated with severe autism is limited orabsent verbal communication. One exciting breakthrough in this area has been thedevelopment of a music-based therapeutic technique that supports verballearning. Catherine Wan is a researcher in the Music and Neuroimaging Laboratoryin Boston where she developed Auditory-Motor Mapping Training (AMMT), anintervention to help non-verbal autistic children.AMMT purports to encourage auditory-motor mappings in the brain by teachingchildren to speak at different pitches while playing tuned drums. While thiskind of therapy is still in the early stages of development, it appears thatAMMT sessions are associated with significant improvements in speech productioneven in children who have uttered hardly a word their whole lives.26[part0017.html#c8fn26]Children on the autistic spectrum may also benefit from movement therapy to helpthem learn coordination and control behaviours. Eneko has equestrian therapy andhis motor coordination seems to have benefited from his riding lessons.Combining music and movement therapy can have positive effects in helpingchildren with autism to improve in restlessness, tantrum and inattentivebehaviours. The rhythmic aspects of music in particular can help promote fineand gross motor skills.27 [part0017.html#c8fn27] Meanwhile, I can report thatEneko’s conducting is going from strength to strength.The latest review on the subject of music therapy on the autistic spectrum28[part0017.html#c8fn28] has laid down several useful guidelines for clinicians,including the use of better measures of movement skills and placing a higherpriority on interactive musical therapies that feature singing, music making andsynchronised rhythmic activities. All signs point towards these kind ofgroup-based social therapies being more effective than passive music listening.ADHDAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a multisymptomatic conditionthat is marked by impulsivity, hyperactivity and a difficulty in focusingattention. These behaviours are associated with maladaptive outcomes includingpoor educational attainment and fractured peer/family relationships. Thecondition is most frequently diagnosed in childhood and currently affectssomewhere between 6 and 8 per cent of children in the UK.Given the controversy surrounding medication for ADHD, there is a growingpressure to investigate alternative therapies. Interest in music therapy forADHD stems from a desire to provide structured and focused activities thatcapture attention and allow for personal expression while requiring a degree ofcooperation with others.Interactive music therapy can also help children with ADHD to tap into theiremotional reactions in a safe and supportive environment and to learn how torecognise and respond to shifts in mood.To date, studies have reported generally favourable outcomes,29[part0017.html#c8fn29] although there are individual differences meaning thatsome children benefit from music compared to other visual therapies whereasothers can be adversely responsive.30 [part0017.html#c8fn30] A review of musictherapy trials in ADHD that met excellent clinical standards31[part0017.html#c8fn31] is being conducted at the time of writing and conclusionsshould be available in the near future.DyslexiaDyslexia is a broad term that encompasses learning difficulties centred onreading and spelling. Severity of dyslexia varies widely and difficulties canextend into verbal memory and verbal processing speed. The NHS’s currentestimate is that between 4 and 8 per cent of school children in England havesome form of dyslexia.32 [part0017.html#c8fn32]Music has been thought of as a therapy for dyslexia thanks partly to thesimilarities between music and language, including the fact that both usestructured sounds that unfold rapidly over time. Music is not a language butthere are many overlaps in the way that we process and integrate these two formsof sound communication,33 [part0017.html#c8fn33] and as such there may be scopefor supporting language learning by boosting musical skills.Studies of auditory brainstem response (see Chapter 2) have shown that childrenwith dyslexia have less stable encoding of sound, further supporting the ideathat musical training may aid the development and function of neurologicalsystems that support reading (see page 42). One hope for future research is thatmusical training may be able to help steady these unstable representations inthe brain.34 [part0017.html#c8fn34]It has long been known that there is a small but significant relationshipbetween reading and music-learning skills.35 [part0017.html#c8fn35] MarieForgeard and colleagues conducted an extensive study with normal-reading anddyslexic children to test the patterns in the relationship between music andreading.36 [part0017.html#c8fn36] Their findings suggested a tight couplingbetween the types of sound skills that can be boosted by musical training andthe types of sound skills that help support the development of reading skills,in all of the children.One additional interesting avenue of music and dyslexia research is concernedwith the influence of rhythm. In 2003 Katie Overy37 [part0017.html#c8fn37]investigated whether musical support could help the timing issues that manychildren with dyslexia encounter.38 [part0017.html#c8fn38] She found thatdyslexic children often scored higher on musical aptitude tests compared totheir control group counterparts, except in the area of timing skills. Shesuggested that supporting rhythmic training with music could help tune readingskills such as the ability to segment syllables in language, leading to easiercomprehension and improved spelling.39 [part0017.html#c8fn39]All this research suggests that a music intervention which strengthens the basicauditory skills of children with dyslexia and other reading difficulties,especially one that incorporates rhythm, may help support their languagelearning.40 [part0017.html#c8fn40] At present there are no clinically acceptedtrials from which to draw firm conclusions about how music education may helpreading,41 [part0017.html#c8fn41] but hopefully such studies will emerge in thefuture, with useful guidelines for best implementation.The futureThere has been a small but significant explosion in music therapy and musicmedicine to support children’s development and care over the last decade, and Ihave just touched on some of the areas here.In practical terms there are proving to be lots of opportunities for musicians,psychologists, doctors, carers and engineers to come together and build usefultechnology to support these efforts. A project that acts as an example of thisis the Virtual Musical Instrument (VMI).42 [part0017.html#c8fn42] The VMI is avisual computer interface that allows people with varying levels of mobility tocreate nice musical sounds in response to body movements. Eneko would love that.Such new music rehabilitation tools hold great promise for therapists, familiesand children.Music and physical well-being in adultsIn this section I will talk about conditions that are more likely to strike inadulthood, such as serious brain injury, stroke, conditions like Parkinson’s,and mental illness. Here we will see how music can help with recovery,re-learning and rehabilitation. I will refer often to the Cochrane reports,systematic reviews of research in health care that are internationallyrecognised as the gold standard in evidence-based health care.43[part0017.html#c8fn43]We begin with brain injury. Our brain is a wonderfully complex thing, which ofcourse means that it can break down in a myriad of diverse ways. Misfortune canvisit in the form of traumatic accidents, stroke, illnesses, infection and toxicexposure (for example, to carbon monoxide). More people than ever survive suchlife events thanks to the advances of modern medicine.Let’s be clear. Music is unlikely to help you survive a brain injury. But itcould have a useful role in recovery.Let’s assume the worst first: that a brain injury or illness causes a spell in acoma or similarly altered state of consciousness, and a stay within intensivecare, probably on a ventilator. How can music help in these circumstances?Coma and ventilationEven in the deepest states of unconsciousness a person may continue to hear theworld around them.44 [part0017.html#c8fn44] This means that music therapy ispossible when someone is in a coma. Therapists can improvise singing or playinginstruments to the rhythms of a pulse or breathing pattern.45[part0017.html#c8fn45] These kinds of techniques can set up a channel ofcommunication, an outside link for a patient in a coma.Measurements taken during such music therapy sessions indicate that comapatients often show signs of relaxation (for example, their breathing settles ona steady, slow rate). EEG recordings of brain activity have also shown that thetypes of brain waves that are prominent during therapy are associated with arelaxed state. Importantly, a coma patient can respond to quiet and gentlesinging, even in a noisy hospital environment.46 [part0017.html#c8fn46]The Cochrane reviews noted many cases where music therapy and music medicine(listening to calming music) can reduce heart and breathing rate, and help keepcoma patients stable over a period of time. Other physiology measures, such asblood pressure, respond less reliably to music interventions in ventilatedpatients, a result which offers a welcome cautionary note about expecting toomuch of music interventions in patients who are critically ill and heavilymedicated.To date, however, because of the positive indicators and since music listeningis an easy intervention to implement, the Cochrane review has concluded thatmusic listening should be offered as a stress management intervention to comaand ventilated patients.47 [part0017.html#c8fn47]StrokeA stroke happens when blood flow in the brain is disrupted by a leakage or ablockage. Cases of stroke are on the rise, partly due to the increase in ourlife expectancies. Worldwide, fifteen million people suffer a stroke every year.The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that the disability-adjusted lifeyears lost to stroke will rise from 38 million in 1990 to 61 million in 2020.48[part0017.html#c8fn48]Teppo Särkämö has studied music in the recovering brain at the Cognitive BrainResearch Unit in Finland.49 [part0017.html#c8fn49] In his thesis Särkämöexplored the impact of music listening on stroke patients against listening toaudio books or no listening activity. All the patients had a thoroughneurological examination six months post-stroke to check on their progress. Boththe music listening and the audio book patients showed improvements to theirauditory processing, but only the music listening group showed a benefit totheir verbal memory and focused attention. Music listening was also found to bebetter for tackling feelings of depression and confusion. This research stronglysupported the inclusion of music as a ‘rehabilitative leisure activity after astroke’.Music therapy has been found to be helpful in cases of unilateral neglect afterstroke. Neglect happens when a stroke patient seems to be unaware of part oftheir environment despite no problems with their vision. Patients with neglectmay only eat part of the food on a plate or shave only part of their face.Listening to classical music has been associated with improvements to attentionin patients’ otherwise neglected field.50 [part0017.html#c8fn50] Music therapy,in particular the use of playing scales on chime bars, has also been found tohelp patients reorient to their neglected field.51 [part0017.html#c8fn51]MovementAround 80 per cent of stroke patients experience a loss of mobility. Mobility isalso a primary issue in conditions such as Parkinson’s, where damage to thedopamine regulatory processes and basal ganglia in the brain leads to disruptedphysical movements. Stroke and Parkinson’s patients face different challenges torecovery and remediation of their condition but music therapy can supportmovement for both populations, and potentially for other groups where motion isan issue.A simple metrical rhythm can help guide patients to walk with less rigid motionand at a steadier pace.52 [part0017.html#c8fn52] This kind of music therapy hasbecome known as rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) and has been developedgreatly in the last ten years. RAS typically consists of metronome-pulsepatterns embedded into rhythmically accentuated instrumental music. Somepatients can have measurable improvements in their walking within 24 hours of afirst RAS training session.Although the biological mechanism by which rhythmic music can help supportwalking and other movements is not yet certain, it is thought that having an‘external timekeeper’ helps patients to synchronise their motor movements asopposed to relying on the disrupted internal timing signals from compromisedareas of the brain.53 [part0017.html#c8fn53]The Cochrane reports found several studies where RAS was associated with betterwalking in stroke patients, including improved speed, stride length andsymmetry, all of which makes for a steadier and safer pedestrian.54[part0017.html#c8fn54] These studies took place in the presence of a musictherapist but I have heard many anecdotal reports of patients listening to andeven composing music on their own to help with their movements.One of the latest developments in this field is called ‘Walk-Mate’. While steadyRAS rhythms may be helpful, they are not very adaptable if a person starts tostruggle or speed up their pace. Walk-Mate is a project that featuresinteractive and real-time responsive rhythmic sound to support movement.55[part0017.html#c8fn55] It is still early days for this technology but resultshave shown even more advanced therapeutic benefits compared to fixed RAS.SpeakingDisrupted motor movements may also impact on speech. Aphasia, a word whichoriginates from the Greek for ‘speechless’, is another common symptom post braininjury or stroke. Aphasia can relate to the understanding or comprehension oflanguage as well as the production or expression of speech. There are a hugevariety of aphasic conditions but music therapy offers new hope for those whostruggle to speak after brain injury.Many of you will be familiar with the case of Gabrielle Giffords, a Member ofthe United States House of Representatives who was the victim of anassassination attempt in early 2011. Gabby, as she is known, was left fightingfor her life with severe brain injuries after being shot in the left temple.Despite such a devastating injury, after much hard work in recovery, Gabby wasable to address the US Congress just over one year later. She credits musictherapy for its part in helping her incredible progress in regaining her speech.I have already discussed how a form of music therapy, AMMT, can help speechproduction in autistic children who struggle with verbal development. AMMT grewout of an earlier development in music therapy that has helped speech recoveryin many adults post brain injury: melodic intonation therapy (MIT).56[part0017.html#c8fn56] The reports and images of Gabby Giffords’ music therapyseem to suggest it followed a similar protocol to MIT.During MIT a therapist will use sung patterns of exaggerated speech, beginningwith just two different pitches (one high and one low) and eventuallyaccompanied by well-known melodies like lullabies. The therapist will also tapthe rhythm of the singing with the patient’s left hand.MIT is most successful in people who have had left hemisphere strokes57[part0017.html#c8fn57] or brain damage, like Gabby; such an injury wouldtypically damage language ability. It is important that the right hemisphere isrelatively spared as MIT helps to retrain that part of the brain to supportspeech.58 [part0017.html#c8fn58] Specifically, MIT has been associated with theincreased recruitment of parallel circuits in the right hemisphere that wouldnormally support language in the left hemisphere, such as premotor areas (forspeech planning) and the superior temporal lobe (sound analysis), as well ascrucial white matter pathways that connect these areas.The mechanism behind MIT is not yet certain and there is an ongoing debate aboutwhich aspects of MIT are actually having an effect. Some claim that singing isnot necessary, that the rhythmic content is most helpful for regaining speech.59[part0017.html#c8fn59] One important point that such studies overlook is thatreal music may work well as it is engaging and fun. At the time of writing, thisdebate rumbles on. What is undeniable is that music therapy has played a crucialrole in the speech recovery of many people such as Gabby Giffords.music [../images/00002.jpeg]To end this section on physical health I want to touch on two of the biggestkillers in modern society: cancer and heart disease. Music will never cureeither of these life-threatening conditions but thanks to many of the effects ofmusic medicine and music therapy that we have already discussed (increasedrelaxation, reduced pain), as well as secondary effects (better sleep,60[part0017.html#c8fn60] faster response to treatment, better perceived quality oflife), music can help to support recovery from cancer and heart disease, and aidin the experience of what can be painful and distressing (although necessary)treatments.Several trials of music therapy and music medicine in cancer patients have shownmeasurable effects on the autonomic relaxation response. Listening to music canreduce heart rate by an average of 4 beats per minute (bpm) and respiratory rateby an average of two breaths per minute,61 [part0017.html#c8fn61] with somecomparable reduction in blood pressure. Similar results have been reported inpatients with heart disease.62 [part0017.html#c8fn62] Those changes may seemsmall but each average 10 bpm reduction in heart rate may reduce the risk ofcardiac death by up to 30 per cent.63 [part0017.html#c8fn63]Having a tool that can trigger real physiological relaxation in this way overtime also has far reaching effects for how people feel from day to day. TheCochrane reports suggest that music therapy and music medicine interventionshave a beneficial effect on anxiety, mood and quality of life measures in peoplewith cancer. The results of some trials suggested that music also has a moderatepain-reducing effect. Finally, the autonomic relaxation response reportedlyreduces muscular tension and vessel constriction – thereby increasing thesuccess rate of painful procedures.64 [part0017.html#c8fn64]Music and mental well-being in adultsGiven the positive impacts of music therapy and music medicine on the body itshould come as no surprise that there is also potential for the treatment ofmental health and well-being.A recent review of the past twenty years of research in this area65[part0017.html#c8fn65] reported that music therapy, in particular active musicmaking, can be used as a complementary therapy in the treatment of depression,66[part0017.html#c8fn66] schizophrenia,67 [part0017.html#c8fn67] and dementia,68[part0017.html#c8fn68] as well as problems of agitation, anxiety, sleeplessnessand substance misuse. Just a few sessions can be enough to see small measurableeffects in symptoms, though larger numbers of sessions (16–51) achieve betterresults; this finding suggests that it might be a case of the more treatmentsessions, the better.69 [part0017.html#c8fn69] I will touch on three specificareas of music and mental well-being here to bring our journey through music andwell-being to a close.Post Traumatic Stress DisorderSome of the earliest recorded use of music therapy dates from the 1940s whenmusical interaction and listening was used to help veterans suffering from‘shell shock’ after the Second World War. This kind of therapy was thought tohelp relieve the high state of anxiety in what is now recognised as PostTraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and to encourage a sense of community out ofthe isolation that often results from leaving the armed forces.Today we know that music can help trigger autonomic relaxation responses thatcan help lower the heightened states of anxiety and vigilance that people withPTSD often experience, even if only temporarily. Being able to escape fromnegative mind and body states plus the increase in personal sense of controlover mental activity can all have measurable effects on quality of life. Musicinterventions can be incorporated as part of therapies designed to help withtension regulation and complex thinking, to assist the client with mentalchallenges like planning, assessing outcomes, and controlling impulsivebehaviours.70 [part0017.html#c8fn70]DepressionMusic therapy is effective in depressive patients because active music makingwithin a therapeutic framework offers a person the unique opportunity for new‘aesthetic, physical and relational experiences’.71 [part0017.html#c8fn71]Practically, this means that music therapy provides an enjoyable way for peoplewho are depressed to increase their level of basic physical activity in a socialcontext with other people who may or may not be facing similar difficulties tothemselves. Building on communication and interaction in this way is seen as aprimary goal of therapy for an individual in a serious state of depression whereinward, negative-biased reflection can be distressingly dominant.Another benefit of music therapy and music medicine for people with depressionis that it gets a high degree of treatment compliance in a population that canoften be resistant to interventions, especially in the initial stages oftreatment.72 [part0017.html#c8fn72] The fact that music listening is enjoyableand can be tailored to each individual to access pleasant life memories (seeChapter 7) also allows for a personal approach to interaction with a therapistand a flexible, portable form of mood regulation that a patient can learn to useby themselves.Dementia and Alzheimer’sDementia is a wide-ranging term that encompasses a number of conditions that arecharacterised by a decline in a person’s mental faculties. Dementia-relatedillnesses, including Alzheimer’s, are associated with multiple cognitive,emotional and behavioural problems that are underwritten by a state of confusionand loss of connection with the social world. Music therapy and music medicinecan provide not only a valuable source of cognitive stimulation but also aconduit through which carers, families and friends can re-learn how tocommunicate and interact with their loved one.In Chapter 7 we talked about how music is strongly linked to our memories andhow musical memories can often survive in cases where other forms of life memoryseem inaccessible, including after brain injury and in dementia.73[part0017.html#c8fn73] This strong link to music in our memory can provide aninvaluable link to a person’s sense of personal history and identity.Music also provides a useful way for Alzheimer’s patients to learn newinformation.74 [part0017.html#c8fn74] This finding may in time provide a basisfor music-based practical memory training that would allow an individual tomaintain their independence for longer.75 [part0017.html#c8fn75]Music can be used to help patients in the later stages of dementia to re-engagewith the people around them, after the point where verbal contact has been lost.Activities such as moving and singing to music encourage physical and mentalengagement with loved ones and carers that can be beneficial for the patient’sstate and bring about changes in quality-oflife measures for family and friends.Music therapy has been associated with significant reductions in both long-termanxiety and depression levels in these patients.76 [part0017.html#c8fn76]Another issue with later-stage dementia is that the person can become distressedby changes to their environment or activities. These changes can be as simple asgetting ready for bed after dinner or meeting a new doctor. In these cases musiccan be introduced as a cue for transition, in order to reduce associated stressreactions.77 [part0017.html#c8fn77] Over time, music comes to act as a relaxed‘primer’ for activities that the patient can come to recognise, meaning times oftransition will be less of a stressful burden for them. When such stressreactions are minimised a person can have better access to their implicit,procedural memories for old habits (such as dressing and washing), allowing fora calmer and more successful, independent everyday routine.Back in 2003 the Cochrane report found no strong evidence either in support ofor against the use of music therapy and music medicine for individuals withdementia; the accumulation of evidence I have described in this sectionindicates how far research can come in a decade. Although no formal update ofthis 2003 report presently exists I am more convinced than ever about thebenefits of music in this group of patients.What kind of music?As with many of the effects we have seen attributed to music throughout thisbook, when considering the best type of music for well-being, personalisation iscrucial; there is no one perfect genre or style of music for everyone. Thispoint brings us right back to the ‘vitamin’ model of music that John Sloboda sowisely warned against at the start of this chapter. A good reaction and positiveoutcomes from music therapy or music medicine for any one person depends on thekind of music that they like.Just to make this point even stronger, we see the consequences of not taking apersonal approach when researchers choose a particular generic type of music,with all good intentions, believing it to have good effects, only to find thatthis blanket introduction of music makes a situation worse.In one case, classical music was played in the communal area of a home forpeople with dementia.78 [part0017.html#c8fn78] Behavioural disturbances werefound to be significantly worse during these musical periods, and many patientsdemanded that the music be removed. However good the intentions of suchresearch, it goes to show that the most important person in any situation wheremusic is introduced for well-being is the patient or client – their needs, likesand desires must drive the selection of music.There are some general rules that can guide music selection beyond simply makingsure it is enjoyed by the client. Where possible, patients should be encouragedto select music characterised by a slow tempo and that lacks abrupt harmonicchanges and sharp timbres, in order to have the best chances of promotingautonomic relaxation. In addition, music that evokes strong emotional reactions,which may be caused by memories associated with the music, should be avoidedwhen used for stress and anxiety-reduction purposes.There is another caveat to the general conclusion that patient-selected music isbest. In some cases unfamiliar music may be more helpful; emotional associationswith music can disrupt and distract from a person’s attention to aspects of themusic which may be critical for their therapy. For example, a therapist or apatient may wish to focus on the rhythm of music in order to help movement butemotional music may distract focus from this part of the sound.Finally, we must consider how we introduce music to medical and therapeuticenvironments. Listening to music through headphones may not be wise duringpainful procedures because it prevents the patient from hearing instructions orcomments by the medical staff. This interference and lack of contact with staffwho are administering treatment may increase patients’ anxiety and,consequently, their perceived pain. In the case of such procedures, it isprobably better to listen to music without headphones.79 [part0017.html#c8fn79]music [../images/00002.jpeg]In our final chapter we have taken a tour through the various ways in which bothmusic therapy and music medicine have been trialled as adjunctive treatments tosupport well-being through the whole of the human lifespan. The music of yourlife may one day have the power to support you through difficult and traumatictimes, though I very much hope that these are few.Music psychology research allows us to better understand how the brain and bodyreact to music in clinical and care situations, and permits therapists andmedical staff to optimise the use of music in these situations, always puttingeach individual at the forefront of planning.Music is not a pill, a solution or a cure when it comes to times of trouble butit can be an important and flexible source of personal support, consolation,connection and inspiration.Through the course of your life journey you have developed a wealth of musicalskills, understandings and memories that are completely unique to you – amusical being that will never be recreated no matter how long the human racelasts.Music will be your lifelong friend and personal companion, your reflection andyour shadow.
