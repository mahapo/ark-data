Sun Wu-k’ung was born of primordial Chaos in a remote island f rom a stone impregnated by the sky. The other monkeys honored him as their king but soo n in search of immortality he left the island and traveled on a raft to civilized lands. A cquiring human speech and manners, he decided to become the disciple of a Buddhist Patr iarch Bodhi. Bodhi was initially reluctant about this but was impressed by monkey’ s determination and brilliant abilities. In three years Wu-k’ung learned perfectly well magical tran sformations, cloud dancing, and martial arts. Soon he was able to leap thousands of miles w ith one somersault. Of course, these marvelous abilities were not acquired withou t learning modern physics and the next chapter describes what he learned in physics from the Pa triarch Bodhi. 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"3 Wu-k’ung learns modern physics The glorious building of modern physics is based on three ele phants (or whales according to another scientific school to which Bodhi is antagonistic). T he elephants stand on the back of a gigantic tortoise which by itself swims in a world ocean o f dark energy. We know very little about the tortoise (Grand Unification, Th eory of Everything), or about the dark energy, but the elephants are studied perfect ly well and these elephants are • gauge symmetry • special relativity • quantum mechanics – Let us take a closer look at them – said the Patriarch to Wu-k’ ung. 3.1 Gauge symmetry – It’s better to learn gauge theory by observing falling cats – began Bodhi his narrative. In the middle ages Europeans were not very fond of cats because c ats were considered as devil creatures. At holidays people used to go on cat hunting. They catch these poor creatures and tormented them in all wicked ways: roasted them alive, wh ipped to death, or threw them into a boiling water [3]. – Oh, my Master, – cried Wu-k’ung – what a stupid brutality of i gnorant and rude people thinking themselves as pious! – They just considered cats as demons, – calmly continued the Patriarch – and they had a good proof for the cat’s devil nature. One favorite amuseme nt at that days was to through down the cats from a church tower, and pretty often the cats su rvived safe this sure death adventure. Why not a proof of cat’s supernatural resistance against inevitable death and hence her devil nature? In more enlightened age, two veterinarians Wayne Whitney an d Cheryl Mehlhaff studied the so called “feline high-rise syndrome” in 1987. They had t heir veterinary clinic in Man- hattan where cats often fall from New-York skyscrapers. The ir findings are schematically shown in the figure below [4, 5]. 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"– Quite a remarkable finding – said Wu-k’ung, surprised a bit – contrary to humans whose chance to die from the falling accident steadily incre ases with height and approaches 100% above a height of about seven floors, the mortality of cat s initially rises to 10% and then falls down to about 5%! Increadibly, cat’s prospects of survival improve with height! Surely there is some explanation of this queer fact? – Yes, of course, – replied the Patriarch – one can imagine the following explanation [5, 6]. Cats reach a terminal velocity of about 100 km/h after flying about 30 meters in air. After this moment the air resistance balances the pull of ear th’s gravity and cat’s velocity ceases to grow. At first sight, one expects the height to be no l onger important for cat’s survival after the terminal velocity is reached. However, t hen the acceleration disappears the cat probably relax and extends its limbs horizontally, fl ying like a flying-squirrel from this moment. This increases its effective transverse area an d hence air resistance, reducing the terminal velocity. – But more important for us is the one particular ingredient o f cat’s enduring power of survival, – continued the Patriarch – it’s their ability to c hange the body’s orientation in the free fall. After all cats always land on their feet, no matter how they were dropped, is not it? Look at this picture of the cat dropped upside down. Withi n less than half a second it turns around its longitudinal axis and land on its feet unhar med. – But I’m surprised, – begin Wu-k’ung – I know the conservatio n of momentum precludes the center of mass of a system to be moved by inner forces. Ther e was a guy, it seems Baron M ̈unchhausen was his name, who claimed that he once escaped f rom a swamp by pulling 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"himself up by his own hair. But he is notorious liar, is not it? And what about the conservation of angular momentum? Does not it precludes the cat to change its orientation if cat’s initial angular momentum was zero? – The cat just uses the conservation of angular momentum in a c lever way [3] – smiled the Patriarch. – Look at the picture. In a first stroke the cat p ulls the front legs tightly against the body and stretches the hind legs perpendicular t o the longitudinal axis of the body away. Thus it increases the moment of inertia of the rear part of the body and lowers the moment of inertia of its front part. But the angular momen tum equals to the product of the moment of inertia over the angular velocity. Therefore, when the cat turns its head and the front body quickly downward, the rear part rotates in the counter direction but with much less angular velocity, in complete agreement with the a ngular momentum conservation law. As a result, the rotation angle of the front part may be ne ar 180 ◦ while the counter rotation angle of the rear part will be much smaller. Then the cat repeats the maneuver in reverse order: now it stretches the front legs from the body a way and pushes the rear ones to the body. This allows the cat to rotate the rear part of the b ody downward with only 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"small swing of the front part and hence to eliminate the twist of its body at the end of this two step flip-flap. – Really ingenious! – said Wu-k’ung – you know monkeys as clos e relatives of humans are vice-kings of Nature and I always largely regarded cats a s inferior creatures, but now I’m beginning to change my opinion. However, how can we descr ibe cat’s somersaulting mathematically? – Good question – answered the Patriarch – and this is the hear t of the matter. But to explain what I have in mind we need some simple model of a cat. A nd here is one, inspired by [7]. We have two dumbbells of identical mass 2 m on the common pivot. The “cat” can control the angle θ ( t ) between the dumbbells, as well as the half-length a ( t ) of one dumbbell. Cat’s goal is by manipulating a and θ to change its orientation specified by the angle Φ. We can regard ( a, θ ) as polar coordinates in the cat’s shape space which in our ca se is just a plane. Any somersaulting of the cat is described in the shape space b y some curve γ which connects its initial and final shapes. If the cat restores its shape aft er performing a flip, the curve γ will be a closed loop. We can calculate the angular momentum of the “cat” very simpl y L = 2 m ( a 2 + b 2 ) ̇ Φ + 2 ma 2 ̇ θ, where b is the half-length of the dumbbell with fixed length. If the an gular momentum was initially zero so it will remain all the time as the cat does no t experience any external torque. This enables us to connect time derivatives of angles Φ and θ as follows ̇ Φ = − a 2 a 2 + b 2 ̇ θ. Using this relation, for the turning angle of the cat we get ∆Φ = T ∫ 0 ̇ Φ dt = ∫ γ [ − a a 2 + b 2 adθ + 0 da ] = ∫ γ ~ A \u0001 d ~ l, 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"where γ is the path in the ( a, θ ) plane which describes consecutive changes in the shape of the cat. Besides we have for the “vector potential” ~ A and for the line element d ~ l the following expressions in polar coordinates ~ A = − a a 2 + b 2 ~e θ , d ~ l = da ~e a + a dθ ~e θ . As we see the time parametrization have dropped from the equa tion. The only thing that matters as far as the total rotation of the cat is concerned is the geometry of the change. The speed at which a and θ change does not matter and only the curve γ in the cat’s shape space, that is a succession of cat’s shapes, uniquely determ ines the total rotation. – However, you can not have any doubts that cats perform this e xercise very quickly, – remarked the Patriarch. – As the American physiologist Dona ld McDonald found in 1960 by using modern high-speed camera, for the full motion casca de cat only needs one-eighth of a second, that is it is properly turned after only the first e ight centimeters of the free fall when dropped upside down [3]. But let us return to the formula for the total rotation angle. By using Stokes’ theorem, we can rewrite it as follows ∆Φ = ∮ ~ A \u0001 d ~ l = ∫∫ S ~ B \u0001 d ~ S, where ~ B = ∇× ~ A = − 2 b 2 ( a 2 + b 2 ) 2 ~e z , d ~ S = a da dθ ~e z . An analogy with a gauge theory can be made even more apparent i f we compare the formulas obtained for ∆Φ to the formula of electron’s phase shift in th e Aharonov-Bohm effect [8] ∆Φ = e ~ c ∮ ~ A \u0001 d ~ l = e ~ c ∫∫ S ~ B \u0001 d ~ S, where now ~ A is a genuine vector potential and ~ B is the corresponding magnetic field. – In connection with the Aharonov-Bohm effect – mentioned Wu- k’ung – I just remem- bered the Arnold principle: If a notion bears a personal name, then this name is not the name of the discoverer, which is said to be so awfully general that being applicable e ven to itself (the Berry principle) [9]. Ten years before [8], Ehre nberg and Siday in their studies of electron microscopy [10] already obtained the main results of [8]. However their work went completely unnoticed. As remarked by Chambers, who one of th e first experimentally veri- fied the Aharonov-Bohm effect, Ehrenberg and Siday “perhaps d id not sufficiently emphasize the remarkable nature of their result” [11]. – This is amusing, of course, – said the Patriarch – however th e importance of contribution of Aharonov and Bohm is beyond any question. – With some caveat to the Arnold principle, – continued he – I s hould say that Guichardet was the first who made explicit a connection between gauge fiel ds and falling cat [12]. Then important contributions by Wilczek and his PhD student Shap ere followed [13, 14]. They also showed that gauge fields are a natural language to describe se lf-propulsion of microorganisms at low Reynolds number [15] (a very nice description of life a t low Reynolds number was given by Purcell [16]). Montgomery in his influential papers [17, 18] investigated the question 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"how cats can perform their maneuvers efficiently (and you can’ t have even slightest doubt that they do this very efficiently). It turns out that for this g oal cats should “solve” almost the same Wong’s equations that describe the motion of a color ed quark in a Yang-Mills field [19]. You can consult a review article [20] for additional in formation. 3.2 Special relativity After Wu-k’ung mastered gauge theory, the time has come to sp eak about special relativity. – The essence of special relativity – begin solemnly the Patr iarch – can be expressed by one sentence: the geometry of empty space-time is Minkowski geometry. – But I suspect – humbly remarked Wu-k’ung – to duly appreciat e the meaning of this sole sentence we need a deep insight into the nature of geomet ry. – That’s right – said the Patriarch – and what is geometry? You surely know about Euclidean geometry and know that the points of the Euclidean plane can be represented by complex numbers. The distance between two points represent ed by complex numbers z 1 and z 2 is given by d 2 ( z 1 , z 2 ) = ( z 2 − z 1 )( ̄ z 2 − ̄ z 1 ) , where the bar means complex conjugation. This is called para bolic linear measure for reasons you will understand after you scrutinize this folio – the Pat riarch transferred to Wu-k’ung some of Klein’s papers [22, 23, 24]. – But I also heard about non-Euclidean geometries of Lobache vsky and Riemann – got excited Wu-k’ung. – For monkey you are well versed in mathematics – praised the P atriarch. In Lobachevsky geometry (hyperbolic linear measure) the distance is given by sinh 2 d ( z 1 , z 2 ) = ( z 2 − z 1 )( ̄ z 2 − ̄ z 1 ) [1 − z 2 ̄ z 2 ][1 − z 1 ̄ z 1 ] 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"and in Riemann or elliptic geometry (elliptic linear measur e) by sin 2 d ( z 1 , z 2 ) = ( z 2 − z 1 )( ̄ z 2 − ̄ z 1 ) [1 + z 2 ̄ z 2 ][1 + z 1 ̄ z 1 ] . – Complex numbers are obtained by adding to the real numbers a special element i which is a solution of the quadratic equation i 2 = − 1. But why this particular quadratic equation? What is special about it? – asked Wu-k’ung. – Nothing special – answered the Patriarch – On equal footing we can assume a special element e to be a solution of the general quadratic equation Ae 2 + Be + C = 0. In fact, in this way we get three different types of generalized complex numbe rs a + eb . If the discriminant D = B 2 − 4 AC is negative, we get the ordinary complex numbers a + ib and one can assume without loss of generality that i 2 = − 1. Indeed, if Ae 2 + Be + C = 0 and D < 0 then i = B √ − D + 2 A √ − D e just have this property i 2 = − 1 and every hyper-complex number a + eb can be rewritten as a ′ + ib ′ . If the discriminant is zero, we get the so called dual numbers a + ǫb and one can assume that ǫ 2 = 0. And if the discriminant is positive, we get the double num bers a + eb with e 2 = 1 [21]. – If now we change complex numbers in the above formulas – gues sed Wu-k’ung – we get other types of geometry? – Absolutely right, – the Patriarch seemed satisfied by Wu-k’ ung’s insight. – For hyper- bolic linear measure, double numbers lead to de Sitter geome try and dual numbers lead to co-Minkowski geometry. For elliptic linear measure, doubl e numbers correspond to anti-de Sitter geometry and dual numbers to co-Euclidean geometry. At last, for parabolic linear measure, dual numbers imply Galilean geometry and double nu mbers lead to Minkowski geometry. On the whole, we have nine so called Cayley-Klein g eometries of the plane (more details can be found in [25]). measure of measure of lengths angles Hyperbolic Parabolic Elliptic Hyperbolic Doubly hyperbolic Minkowski co-Hyperbolic (de-Sitter) (anti de-Sitter) Parabolic co-Minkowski Galilean co-Euclidean Elliptic Hyperbolic Euclidean Elliptic (Lobachevsky) (Riemann) – However, – remarked Wu-k’ung, – special relativity is not a merely geometric theory, but a physical one and it includes concepts like causality, r eference frames, inertial motion, relativity principle. – Absolutely right again, – said the Patriarch. Let us see wha t geometry will arise if we stick to these physical notions. 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"It is intuitively appealing to suppose that meter sticks do n ot change their lengths when gently set in uniform motion – continued the Patriarch. – How ever, this is not quite obvious and we simply admit a more general possibility, instead of su pposing unchanged lengths. Accordingly, we change the Galilean transformations, whic h describe a transition from one inertial frame to another, by x ′ = 1 k ( V 2 ) ( x − V t ) , where the scale factor k ( V 2 ) accounts for the possible change in the length of the meter stick when it is set in motion with velocity V . It can depend only on the magnitude of the relative velocity V , because the Relativity Principle and the isotropy of space is assumed to be valid. Due to the Relativity Principle, the same relation holds if u nprimed coordinates are expressed through the primed ones, with V replaced by − V . Therefore, x = 1 k ( V 2 ) ( x ′ + V t ′ ) = 1 k ( V 2 ) [ 1 k ( V 2 ) ( x − V t ) + V t ′ ] . Solving for t ′ , we get t ′ = 1 k ( V 2 ) [ t − 1 − k 2 ( V 2 ) V x ] . Now we are in a position to derive the velocity addition rule, v ′ x = dx ′ dt ′ = dx − V dt dt − 1 − k 2 V dx = v x − V 1 − 1 − k 2 V v x . By using the Relativity principle, it will be convenient to w rite down it in the form v x = v ′ x + V 1 + 1 − k 2 V v ′ x ≡ F ( v ′ x , V ) . F must be an odd function of its arguments F ( − x, − y ) = − F ( x, y ), because If we change the signs of both velocities v ′ x and V it is obvious that the sign of the resulting velocity v x will be also changed. Consider now three bodies A , B and C in a relative motion. Let V AB denote the velocity of A with respect to B so that V BA = − V AB . Then we will have F ( V CB , V BA ) = V CA = − V AC = − F ( V AB , V BC ) = − F ( − V BA , − V CB ) = F ( V BA , V CB ) . Therefore F is a symmetric function of its arguments and then F ( v ′ x , V ) = F ( V, v ′ x ) imme- diately yields 1 − k 2 ( V 2 ) V v ′ x = 1 − k 2 ( v ′ 2 x ) v ′ x V, or 1 − k 2 ( V 2 ) V 2 = 1 − k 2 ( v ′ 2 x ) v ′ 2 x ≡ K, where K is a constant. 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"If K > 0, we can take K = 1 c 2 and introduce a dimensionless parameter β = V c . As a result, we get the Lorentz transformations x ′ = 1 √ 1 − β 2 ( x − V t ) , t ′ = 1 √ 1 − β 2 ( t − V c 2 x ) , and, hence, Minkowski geometry. In this case, velocity addi tion rule indicates that c is an invariant velocity. If K = 0, we recover the Galilean transformations and the geometr y behind the corresponding space-time is Galilean geometry. Note that Galilean geometry can be considered as a limiting case of Minkowski geometry when c → ∞ . The case K < 0 corresponds to Euclidean space-time which does not allow us to define an invariant time order between events, that is to distinguish future from pas t and introduce causality (see [25] for more details). – As I see – Wu-k’ung seemed a bit puzzled, – if we stick to the Re lativity principle, space isotropy and inertial reference frames, the only spac e-time geometry which emerges is Minkowski geometry along with its rather singular limit of G alilean geometry. And what about other Cayley-Klein geometries? – In fact, – answered the Patriarch, – the existence of inerti al reference frames is, in general, not obviously guaranteed. Therefore we can consid er the boost transformations in a more general context as not necessarily representing tran sitions from one inertial frame to another. This opens a possibility to generalize special rel ativity by deforming its underlying symmetry structure - the Poincar ́e algebra [26]. The symmetry group of special relativity is the ten-paramet er Poincar ́e group. Ten basis elements of its Lie algebra are the following: the generator H of time translations; three generators P i of space translations along the i -axis; three generators J i of spatial rotations; and three generators K i of pure Lorentz transformations, which can be considered as the inertial transformations (boosts) along the i -axis. The commutation relations involving J i have the form [ J i , H ] = 0 , [ J i , J j ] = ǫ ijk J k , [ J i , P j ] = ǫ ijk P k , [ J i , K j ] = ǫ ijk K k . We can not change these commutation relations without spoil ing the spatial isotropy. How- ever, other commutation relations [ H, P i ] = 0 , [ H, K i ] = P i , [ P i , P j ] = 0 , [ K i , K j ] = − ǫ ijk J k , [ P i , K j ] = δ ij H are less rigid and can be deformed as they depend on the interp retation of inertial transfor- mations (boosts) which we want to change. If we demand the parity and time-reversal invariance, the on ly possible deformations of these commutation relations will have the form [26] [ H, P i ] = ǫ 1 K i , [ H, K i ] = λP i , [ P i , P j ] = αǫ ijk J k , [ K i , K j ] = βǫ ijk J k , [ P i , K j ] = ǫ 2 δ ij H. The Jacobi identities [ P i , [ P j , K k ]] + [ P j , [ K k , P i ]] + [ K k , [ P i , P j ]] = 0 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"and [ P i , [ K j , K k ]] + [ K j , [ K k , P i ]] + [ K k , [ P i , K j ]] = 0 , are satisfied only if α − ǫ 1 ǫ 2 = 0 , and β + λǫ 2 = 0 . After the deformation, the Poincar ́e group is replaced by th e so called kinematical group – the generalized relativity group of nature. As we see, the s tructure of its Lie algebra is completely determined by three real parameters ǫ 1 , ǫ 2 and λ . Note that the overall sign of the structure constants is irrelevant as the sign change of all s tructure constants can be achieved simply by multiplying each infinitesimal generator by − 1. Therefore we can assume λ ≥ 0 without loss of generality and by a scale change it can be brou ght either to λ = 1 or λ = 0. If λ = 1, every kinematical group has its underlying Cayley-Klei n geometry as the geom- etry of the corresponding space-time. We have the following possibilities (more details can be found in [25]): • ǫ 2 < 0 - the inertial transformations form a compact group and it i s not possible (like Euclidean space-time) to introduce a causal order between e vents. Such space-times, if they exist at all (the formation of a Euclidean region in the c enter of a black hole might be a possible outcome of gravitational collapse [27]), are, however, not kinematical as they, in fact, are timeless Nirvanas. • ǫ 1 > 0 , ǫ 2 > 0 - de Sitter kinematics ( DS ) with doubly-hyperbolic geometry. • ǫ 1 < 0 , ǫ 2 > 0 - anti de Sitter kinematics ( ADS ) with co-hyperbolic geometry. • ǫ 1 = 0 , ǫ 2 > 0 - Poincar ́e kinematics ( P ) with Minkowski geometry. • ǫ 1 > 0 , ǫ 2 = 0 - Newton-Hook kinematics ( NH ) with co-Minkowski geometry. • ǫ 1 < 0 , ǫ 2 = 0 - anti Newton-Hook kinematics ( ANH ) with co-Euclidean geometry. • ǫ 1 = 0 , ǫ 2 = 0 - Galilean kinematics ( G ) with Galilean geometry. The case λ = 0 gives rise to five more possibilities of rather exotic kine matics of limited physical significance as they correspond to space-times wit h absolute space: • ǫ 1 = 1 , ǫ 2 = 1 - anti para-Poincar ́e kinematics ( AP ′ )with Euclidean geometry. • ǫ 1 = − 1 , ǫ 2 = 1 - para-Poincar ́e kinematics ( P ′ ) with Minkowski geometry. • ǫ 1 = 1 , ǫ 2 = 0 - para-Galilei kinematics ( G ′ ) with Galilean geometry. • ǫ 1 = 0 , ǫ 2 = ± 1 - Carroll kinematics ( C ) with Galilean geometry. • ǫ 1 = 0 , ǫ 2 = 0 - static kinematics ( S ) with trivial geometry. – All these kinematical groups along relations between them are shown in the figure below, – said the Patriarch, – and you, Wu-k’ung, should cons ult the literature ([25, 26]) to better understand the nature of these relations between var ious kinematical groups. Then you will find out that all corresponding relativity theories are in fact limiting cases of the de Sitter or anti de Sitter space-times. 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"– I see – exclaimed Wu-k’ung – “there exists essentially only one way to generalize special relativity, namely, by endowing space-time with some const ant curvature” [26]. – That’s right – answered the Patriarch – and it is not surpris ing that, as the recent astro- physical observations indicate, we live actually in the de S itter space-time, not Minkowski. However, the cosmological constant which measures the curv ature of this de Sitter space- time is incredibly small - by about 120 degrees of magnitude s maller than expected on some “natural” grounds! Just this incredible smallness of the co smological constant renders the special relativity to the extremely good approximation to r eality and, therefore, to one of the most trustworthy elephant upon which the whole building of modern physics rests. 3.3 Quantum mechanics At last Wu-k’ung was prepared to study quantum mechanics. – Normal people (that is not physicists) usually consider th e quantum mechanics as the subject extremely vague and far from the common sense – smile d the Patriarch as the time came for Wu-k’ung to study quantum mechanics. – This is partly really so – readily answered Wu-k’ung. – Here is a notorious story about the famous mathematicians Russell and Whitehead [28]. One o f them was the speaker at a seminar, and the other was the Chairman of that seminar. The talk was devoted to the foundations of quantum mechanics. At the end not only the seminar participants were already on the throat satisfied by the report, but so was the Ch airman. It was extremely difficult, confused and unclear. When the report ended, the Ch airman felt that he ought to comment on the report. So he said only one sentence which at the same time was both polite and truthful. He simply said: ”We should be thankful t o the speaker for what he did not obfuscate further this already sufficiently obscure subj ect.” – An amusing history indeed, – remarked the Patriarch – but in reality the quantum mechanics is not at all obscure and far from everyday experie nce contrary to beliefs of the average man. Suppose an electron has to move from one point to another. How it can do this? – One has to know forces that act on the electron. Then you can a pply Newton’s second law and find the trajectory – replied Wu-k’ung. – Forget about forces – interrupted the Patriarch. – Do you re member the Aharonov- Bohm effect? Besides, force is a vague notion borrowed from po litics. “In the Newtonian theory of the solar system, the sun seems like a monarch whose behests the planets have to 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"obey” [29]. In fact, “ F = ma is formally empty, microscopically obscure, and maybe even morally suspect” [30]. To follow the classical trajectory a n electron has to solve second order differential equation which the Newton’s second law is. How o n earth it can perform this if it is brainless? Simply the electron is too tiny to have any brain. It needs a very simple instruction to be able to follow it, and the simplest instruc tion is: “Explore all paths” [31]. – But how can the electron reach any particular destination i f all paths you can imagine are equivalent? – exclaimed Wu-k’ung. – They are not completely equivalent – was the Patriarch’s re ply. – They differ in a subtle way. A complex number called the amplitude is prescri bed to each path. All paths are equivalent in a sense that all these complex numbers have unite magnitude, but their phases may be different. To find out the probability that the el ectron will reach some particular destination you sum up amplitudes of all paths le ading to this particular point and the squared magnitude of the resulting complex number gi ves you the desired probability. You will be surprised, Wu-k’ung, but all the quantum mechani cs is based on these simple principles just described [32]. – But this seems crazy! – Wu-k’ung was really surprised. – You are not alone in your bewilderment – smiled the Patriarc h. – Freeman Dyson recollects: Thirty-one years ago, Dick Feynman told me about his “sum ove r histories” version of quantum mechanics. “The electron does anything i t likes,” he said. “It just goes in any direction at any speed, forward or backward in time, ho wever it likes, and then you add up the amplitudes and it gives you the wave-function.” I s aid to him, “You’re crazy.” But he wasn’t [33]. – But quantum mechanics is extremely strange, isn’t it? – ask ed Wu-k’ung. – for example take the superposition principle. Is it really not strange t hat a quantum system can be in a superposition of classically mutually exclusive states? This clearly does not fit in our everyday experience. – Look at the figure below – said the Patriarch in answer. – This is the famous portrait of Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci . – At that time Wu- k’ung was pretty well educated in art. – But why this portrait is often regarded as enigmatic, myste rious and incomprehensible? – asked the Patriarch. 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"– Some say the portrait looks different every time we look at it – Wu-k’ung was thoughtful. Then he continued – “Sometimes she seems to mock at us, and the n again we seem to catch something like sadness in her smile. All this sounds rather m ysterious and so it is” [34]. – And an analogy with quantum mechanics can help us to disenta ngle the enigma [34] – the Patriarch showed Wu-k’ung a couple of figures. – Incredible! – uttered Wu-k’ung. – The women on the left is de finitely sad and the one on the right unquestionably cheerful! – You see, Wu-k’ung, – the Patriarch looked triumphant – quan tum mechanics is not at all as queer as it seems at first sight. Even such an unusual n otion as the superposition of different states has its counterpart in art. Symbols of art , being macroscopic classical objects, have to obey the laws of classical physics. However , “their meaning need not to be constrained by this theory. They could be organized in a way t hat corresponds to quantum logic. This would be difficult, but it is not impossible. The ar t offers great many possibilities for doing that since there are no limits on its expressive pow er. The piece of art can lead us to some well organized world which has nothing in common wi th the one of our everyday experience” [34]. – But how about the amazing quantum non-locality? – asked Wu- k’ung – does it contra- dict to special relativity? I heard in 1935 Einstein, Podols ky and Rosen (EPR) wrote a paper [35] where it was claimed that quantum mechanics fails to pro vide a complete description of physical reality because it predicts things “no reasonab le definition of reality could be expected to permit” [35]. What’s all the fuss about? – Imagine a linearly polarized photon flying in some directio n and a polarizing filter such that the photons either pass through or are absorbed by the po larizing filter [36]. Let | H > be a polarization state of the photon such that it always pass es a horizontal filter but is guaranteed to be absorbed by a vertical filter. Analogously w e define | V > with the roles of the horizontal and vertical filters interchanged. Quantu m mechanics allows the following two-photon state (which is called the twin state in [36]) | Ψ > = √ 1 2 ( | V > | V > + | H > | H > ) . The photons in this state are entangled: if the first photon pa sses through a horizontal polarizing filter, the second photon is guaranteed to pass th rough another filter similarly oriented, and if the first photon is absorbed, so does the seco nd photon. Therefore, by 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"measuring the polarization of the first photon we instantly w ill know the polarization of the second photon also, regardless the spatial separation betw een photons. – I do not find this surprising in any obvious way – said Wu-k’un g. – There are “many examples of similar correlations in everyday life. The case of Bertlmann’s socks is often cited. Dr. Bertlmann likes to wear two sock of different colou rs. Which colour he will have on a given foot on a given day is quite unpredictable. But when you see that the first sock is pink you can be already sure that the second sock will not be pink. Observation of the first, and experience of Bertlmann, gives immediate informa tion about the second. There is no accounting for tastes, but apart from that there is no my stery here. And is not the EPR business just the same?” [37]. Or take the example of iden tical twins who had been separated at birth [38]. They had many of their tastes and hab its identical not to speak of their exactly alike appearance. This possibly struck man y people including the twins themselves if they ever meet as a very surprising correlatio n. But in this case we have a ready ’hidden-variable’ explanation: they have the same DN A. Maybe someday we will find analogous hidden-variable explanations of various quantu m mechanical phenomena which at present we find puzzling. – Be careful, Wu-k’ung – smiled the Patriarch. – Dr. Bertlman n himself finds the affairs rather puzzling, realizing their fundamental importance [ 39]. I think you do not question that the colour of the first sock preexisted before your saw it . Neither will doubt you that if the colour of the first sock allows to predict instantly that t he other sock has a different colour then you are bound to conclude that this latter colour also pr eexisted and was predefined before your colour “measurement” with the first sock. And thi s is exactly the logic of EPR. – Fine logic. And you want to say that something is wrong with i t? – Nothing wrong with the logic. But quantum mechanics someho w evades it. Can you imagine a quantum sock with no predefined colour? In some cohe rent mixture of pink and green, say? Probably you can if you remember ineffable smile o f Mona Lisa. This is a strange but rather routine business in quantum world. The entangled photons in the EPR thought experiment do not have predefined polarizations according t o quantum theory. Only after the measurement the wave function collapses towards a sharp ly defined polarization state. The trouble is buried in the fact that the wave function of the entangled photons is not equal to the product of wave functions of two individual photons. I t is inseparable quantity and collapses as the whole even for photons widely spaced apart. Do you feel now a problem? How the second photon instantly “knows” to what polarizatio n state to collapse after the measurement is done with the first photon, say, in another gal axy? – I admit this is rather puzzling – mused Wu-k’ung. – And what i s wrong with EPR reasoning? – The logic behind the EPR reasoning is so fine that the result c an be formulated as a theorem: If the predictions of quantum mechanics are correct (even fo r systems made of remote correlated particles) and if physical reality can be described in a local (or separable) way, then quantum mechanics is necessarily incomplete: som e “elements of reality” exist in Nature that are ignored by this theory [40]. Nobody questions the validity of the theorem. Therefore, the question is whether the nature is indeed non- local as quantum mechanics suggests or the latter is only an incomplete description of r eality. Note that physics was always non-local except some 10 years beginning from about 1 915 when Einstein’s general relativity removed at last “spooky actions at a distance” fr om Newtonian gravity. But the local paradise, for which Newton so longed, ended in about 19 25 with the advent of quantum 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"mechanics which reintroduced non-locality, albeit quite i n a different and subtle way than in Newtonian gravity [41]. – But why quantum mechanics cannot prove to be incomplete? – a sked Wu-k’ung. – After all so many physical theories turned out to be incomple te. Even special relativity is incomplete as it does not describe gravity. And some think bo th the special and general relativities are emergent low-energy phenomena [42]. Why q uantum mechanics is considered to be more fundamental than these venerable theories? – Let us return to the twin state photons [36], – begin the Patr iarch. – Suppose the photon polarizations indeed do have predefined values as req uired by local realism, like Bertlmann’s socks. That is we are supposing that the source o f these photons, whatever it is, produces with probability λ 1 the combination of photon polarizations | V > | V > , and with probability λ 2 the combination | H > | H > , while never | H > | V > or | V > | H > , so that λ 1 + λ 2 = 1. Suppose further that the two polarizing filters, which an alyze the polarization state of photons, are tilted by angles θ 1 and θ 2 , respectively, with respect to the vertical. And here is a good problem to test your advance in ph ysics, Wu-k’ung: what is the odds of getting the same result on both sides (either both photons transmitted or both absorbed)? – If the photon’s polarization is | V > , it has cos 2 θ probability, according to the Malus’ law, to be transmitted by the polarizing filter inclined by th e angle θ , and sin 2 θ probability to be absorbed by it. For the | H > polarization, probabilities are sin 2 θ and cos 2 θ respec- tively. The probability both photons to be transmitted is, t herefore, P T = λ 1 cos 2 θ 1 cos 2 θ 2 + λ 2 sin 2 θ 1 sin 2 θ 2 , as the probabilities of | H > | H > and | V > | V > combinations are λ 1 and λ 2 . Similarly, the probability both photons to be absorbed is P A = λ 1 sin 2 θ 1 sin 2 θ 2 + λ 2 cos 2 θ 1 cos 2 θ 2 . – That’s right – the Patriarch encouraged Wu-k’ung. – And the n? – The probability you asking me is clearly P LR = P T + P A = cos 2 θ 1 cos 2 θ 2 + sin 2 θ 1 sin 2 θ 2 . – Fine. And what is the answer according to quantum mechanics ? – I think the answer is P QM = | < θ 1 | < θ 2 | Ψ > | 2 + | < π/ 2 − θ 1 | < π/ 2 − θ 2 | Ψ > | 2 . And to calculate this, we can decompose | θ > = cos θ | V > + sin θ | H > to get < θ 1 | < θ 2 | = < V | < V | cos θ 1 cos θ 2 + < H | < H | sin θ 1 sin θ 2 + < V | < H | cos θ 1 sin θ 2 + < H | < V | sin θ 1 cos θ 2 . It remains to do a simple algebra and trigonometry to obtain P QM = cos 2 ( θ 1 − θ 2 ). – You see the answers are different – remarked the Patriarch. – Do you find this surpris- ing? – Not at all – answered Wu-k’ung. – After all quantum mechanic s is a different theory. Why should I be surprised that it gives a different result than the local-realistic classical expectation? – The problem is not that quantum mechanics gives a different r esult – smiled the Pa- triarch. – The problem is that it gives incomprehensible result. Dr. Herbert invented the 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"general idea [43] which I will use to explain to your why the an swer of quantum mechanics is incomprehensible. The argument goes as follows [36, 44, 4 5]. Suppose the source of twin photons emits some sequence of pol arized photons with either horizontal or vertical polarizations. Were the polarizing filter oriented horizontally, the observer near it would register some sequence of either tran smitted photons ( T ) or the absorbed ones ( A ), say S (0) = { A, T, T, A, A, T, A, T, A, T, T, T, A, T, A, A, A, A, T, A, T, T, A, T } . The same sequence will be registered by the horizontally ori ented polarizing filter on the other side of the source because for twin photons their polar izations are 100% correlated like Bertlmann’s socks colours. Now if we rotate one of the polari zing filter by some angle θ , it will register another sequence of transmitted or absorbed p hotons, say S ( θ ) = { A, T, T, T, A, T, A, T, A, A, T, A, A, T, T, A, T, A, T, A, T, T, T, T } . Now the correlation between S (0) and and S ( θ ) is not 100%, of course. There are some mismatches, highlighted below S (0) = { A, T, T, A , A, T, A, T, A, T , T, T , A, T, A , A, A , A, T, A, T, T, A , T } S ( θ ) = { A, T, T, T , A, T, A, T, A, A , T, A , A, T, T , A, T , A, T, A, T, T, T , T } – According to the formula P LR = P T + P A = cos 2 θ 1 cos 2 θ 2 +sin 2 θ 1 sin 2 θ 2 your obtained, Wu-k’ung, we expect the probability of getting the same resu lt on both sides to be in this case cos 2 θ and hence the mismatch probability sin 2 θ . You observe six mismatches from twenty four events. Therefore the mismatch probability is a bout 1 / 4 which indicates the inclination angle θ = 30 ◦ , although this is not essential for subsequent considerati ons. If we rotate the polarizing filter not by the angle θ , but − θ , the mismatch probability should remain the same sin 2 θ according to your formula, Wu-k’ung, although the sequence of results registered in this case will be of course different , say S ( − θ ) = { A, T, A, A, A, T, T, T, A, T, T, T, A, T, A, T, T, A, T, A, T, A, T, T } . We still have about six mismatches although at different plac es: S (0) = { A, T, T , A, A, T, A , T, A, T, T, T, A, T, A, A , A , A, T, A, T, T , A , T } S ( − θ ) = { A, T, A , A, A, T, T , T, A, T, T, T, A, T, A, T , T , A, T, A, T, A , T , T } And what will happen if one polarizing filter is rotated by the angle θ and the another, on the opposite side, by the angle − θ as indicated in the figure below? What you can say about the mismatch rate in this case? 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"– Well, – begin Wu-k’ung – as the filters are well separated as I understand, they cannot influence each other. So I expect one filter to register the seq uence S ( θ ) and the another one - the sequence S ( − θ ). The mismatch rate cannot exceed 2 sin 2 θ because there are some cases where both S ( θ ) and S ( − θ ) disagree with the result at zero angle S (0) and, therefore, agree with each other. Indeed, there are only eight mismatch es between S ( θ ) and S ( − θ ): S ( θ ) = { A, T, T , T , A, T, A , T, A, A , T, A , A, T, T , A , T, A, T, A, T, T , T, T } S ( − θ ) = { A, T, A , A , A, T, T , T, A, T , T, T , A, T, A , T , T, A, T, A, T, A , T, T } No wonder this observation is consistent with the formula P LR = P T + P A = cos 2 θ 1 cos 2 θ 2 + sin 2 θ 1 sin 2 θ 2 I derived for the coincidence rate. Indeed, when θ 1 = θ and θ 1 = − θ , we get P LR = cos 4 θ + sin 4 θ = 1 − 2 sin 2 θ cos 2 θ . Therefore the expected mismatch rate is 2 sin 2 θ cos 2 θ and this clearly does not exceed 2 sin 2 θ . By the way, for θ = 30 ◦ , the mismatch probability is 3 / 8 and, therefore, we expect nine mismatches between S ( θ ) and S ( − θ ). In reality we observe eight mismatches, but this is just a play o f statistics. Everything seems coherent for me. – My congratulations, Wu-k’ung, – the Patriarch was very ser ious. – You have just discovered a simple-minded version of Bell’s inequality wh ich all local-realistic models must satisfy [46]. In fact Bell’s inequalities can be considered as examples of George Boole’s mid-nineteenth century ’Conditions of Possible Experienc e’ that the relative frequencies of logically connected events must satisfy [47]. There are jus t the logic and common sense behind them. This brings any theory which violates Bell’s in equalities “on the edge of a logical contradiction” [47]. And quantum mechanics is just such a theory! Remember what you get as the quantum mechanical prediction for the coincid ence rate in our twin photon business? For θ 1 = θ and θ 1 = − θ , the prediction is P QM = cos 2 (2 θ ). Therefore quantum mechanics predicts the mismatch rate 1 − P QM = sin 2 (2 θ ) = 4 sin 2 θ cos 2 θ and this does not exceed 2 sin 2 θ only if cos 2 θ ≤ 1 / 2. For example, if θ = 30 ◦ then 1 − P QM = 3 / 4 which is grater than 2 sin 2 30 ◦ = 1 / 2. The Bell’s inequality you obtained is clearly violated he re! – But how! – exclaimed Wu-k’ung, – What the hell is going here! How this simple result of logical reasoning can be violated by the theory whi ch is overwhelmingly tested? I’m confused. – “Anybody who is not bothered by Bell’s theorem has to have ro cks in his head” [48] – replied the Patriarch. – And here is the answer on your questi on “why quantum mechanics cannot prove to be incomplete”. It cannot prove to be incompl ete in the EPR business because simply experiments confirm that the Bell’s inequali ties are indeed violated in some circumstances with complete agreement with the quantum mec hanical predictions [49]. We are forced to accept a strange view of reality quantum mechan ics offers us. “Before Bell’s discovery, one could still imagine that a local reality lurk ed beneath the experimental facts, after 1964, one could blissfully believe in a strictly local world only by hoping that quantum theory was wrong in its predictions concerning photons in th e twin state” [44]. But it was not wrong. – And what about special relativity? How can it swallow this “ spooky actions at a distance”? – Wu-k’ung seemed perplexed. – Quantum mechanics and relativity can co-exist peacefully because the non-local corre- lations described above does not allow faster-than-light s ignaling [41]. However, all of this looks very subtle and the legitimate question still is wheth er relativity or quantum mechanics can be considered complete. Sometimes it is even claimed tha t “with the presently available 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"models we have the alternative: Either the conventional und erstanding of relativity is not right, or quantum mechanics is not exact” [50]. Frankly spea king, I should admit that “the violation of the Bell-inequality implies that the relation between quantum mechanics and special relativity is more subtle than customarily assumed ” [51]. Some think quantum mechanics is more fundamental than relat ivity. To explain what they have in mind and as an another example of the magic of art w ith profound physical meaning consider the following figure. – A face of the beautiful girl, – said Wu-k’ung – I appreciate h er beauty but what a physical meaning on earth does it have? – Upon inspecting the figure closely, – answered the Patriarc h – you probably will find no face at all whatever beautiful or not in the figure. All what remain are some flowers and butterfly. The face of the beautiful girl is an emergent ph enomenon: it exists when things are inspected at some scale but disappears at finer sca les. And the crucial thing is that this hierarchical architecture pervades the Nature, b eing the outstanding principle of its functionality [52, 53]. The whole very often is not merel y more than but entirely different from the sum of its parts. The following passage from [52] onl y at first sight seems like a joke but it actually hints very deep meaning: “Marx said that quan titative differences become qualitative ones, but a dialog in Paris in the 1920’s sums it u p even more clearly: FITZGERALD: The rich are different from us. HEMINGWAY: Yes, they have more money. “ We routinely have emergent physical phenomena and the organ izing principles which regulate them make sense only at the corresponding scale. They simply do not exist outside the context established by this scale. Besides, these higher or ganizing principles are insensitive to fine details of underlying micro-physics [53]. That’s why biologists and chemists can do their science without knowing nuclear physics or theory of e lementary particles. Owing to this remarkable property of Nature’s organization science acquires its main strength: it can operate and progress in a modular manner [54]. It is quite possible that relativity is also an emergent phen omenon [42, 55, 56]. Towards this possibility hints the fact that there are some condense d matter systems where electron transport is essentially governed by the Dirac equation and a kind of effective relativity arises [57, 58]. For example, in graphene, a mono-layer of ca rbon atoms, charge carriers mimic relativistic particles with zero mass and the effectiv e Lorentz invariance emerges with limiting velocity of about 10 6 m / s which is much smaller than the light velocity in vacuum [57]. In these condensed matter examples quantum mec hanics is the fundamental 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"theory governing the underlying micro-physics while the eff ective relativistic behaviour is an emergent phenomenon valid only in the low-energy sector. However, let us return to quantum non-locality. I see you are impressed by it. Sur- prisingly, the majority of physicists does not bother much a bout it. They become used to oddities of quantum mechanics. You surely think Bell’s proo f exploded “like a bombshell in the corridors of science” [44]. In reality, however, Bell ’s paper [46], published in a not- mainstream short-lived journal, was largely ignored for fiv e years and fallow physicists were not at all impressed by it [38, 44]. You know “the majority of p hysicists are phenomenalists – whose professional world is circumscribed by phenomena and mathematics. A phenomenalist perceives science as advancing in two directions: 1. new exp eriments uncover novel phenom- ena; 2. new mathematics explain or predict phenomena in orig inal ways. Since it proposes no new experiments and derives no new phenomena-relevant ma thematics, but merely puts certain constraints on an invisible reality, Bell’s proof l ies outside the fashionable formula for success in science and is generally dismissed by scienti sts as ’mere philosophy’ “ [44]. Therefore, to convince you finally how strange the quantum wo rld view is I tell you about Wheeler’s delayed-choice experiment. Consider the follow ing experimental arrangement [59]: A single-photon pulse is split by a first beam-splitter BS input and it travels through two arms of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer until being recombin ed by a second beam-splitter BS output . The photon is then detected by one of the two detectors D 1 and D 2 with equal probabilities. However, if we induce a phase shift φ between the two arms and vary it, the detection probabilities at ports D 1 and D 2 will be no longer equal. Instead they will be modulated as cos 2 φ and sin 2 φ respectively. – This is an interference phenomenon familiar from Young’s d ouble-slit experiment, – remarked Wu-k’ung. – That’s correct, – said the Patriarch. – Interference appea rs because we can’t tell which way from the two possibilities the photon arrived by to the de tector which it fired. However, we can remove the second beam-splitter BS output so that each detector D 1 or D 2 is uniquely associated to a given path of the interferometer. In this cas e we expect the interference to disappear and the experiment, of course, confirms our expect ation. In the first case light behaves as a wave and in the second case a s a particle. The famous wave-particle duality. As Bohr would say “the behavior of a q uantum system is determined by the type of measurement performed on it” [59]. – You said people got used of it – smiled Wu-k’ung. 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"– However, – remarked the Patriarch, – our classical picture that either light goes through the both arms of the interferometer like a wave, or makes a cho ice to follow a definite path like a particle, depending what type of measurement we decid e to perform on, is too naive. J. A. Wheeler proposed the famous ‘delayed-choice’ Gedanke nexperiment in which the choice remove or not the second beam-splitter BS output is made after the photon has already passed the first beam-splitter BS input . A real experiment very close in spirit to the Wheeler’s origi nal suggestion was performed [59]. In this experiment, the clock that triggers the single -photon emission simultaneously generates a random choice of the interferometer configurati on (with BS output or not) by means of specially designed random number generator and the fast electro-optical modulator (EOM) along with some other optical equipment. With no volta ge applied to the EOM, one effectively has BS output removed, and it can be effectively brought back within 40 ns by fast switching on the appropriate voltage on the EOM. The ran dom number generator was located close to the output of the interferometer while BS input was some 48 meters away. This configuration guarantees, assuming no faster-than-li ght signaling, that the photon can not get any information about the made choice between interf erometer configurations before it reaches BS input . Actually, such an information might be available for the ph oton when it is about halfway in the interferometer, long after passing BS input [59]. – And what was the results? – Wu-k’ung was intrigued. – They found that “Nature behaves in agreement with the predi ctions of Quantum Me- chanics even in surprising situations where a tension with R elativity seems to appear” [59] – answered The Patriarch. – It was demonstrated “beyond any d oubt that the behavior of the photon in the interferometer depends on the choice of the observable which is measured, even when that choice is made at a position and a time such that it is separated from the entrance of the photon in the interferometer by a space-like interval” [59]. – Interesting, – said Wu-k’ung. – But I feel I’m becoming used to the strange world of quantum mechanics. – Wait a moment, – smiled the Patriarch. – By the use of entangl ed photons we can make the previous situation even more surprising. Now the ex perimental arrangement looks like this [60]: 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"An ultraviolet argon laser creates entangled photons throu gh the so called spontaneous parametric down conversion process when it illuminates a be ta-barium borate (BBO) crystal. The polarizations of the entangled photons are strictly cor related: if photon a is detected to have a vertical polarization then the polarization of the ph oton b will be necessarily horizontal and vice versa. Signal photons ( a ) pass through the double slit and the interference fringes can be observed by the corresponding detector D a , while idler or passive photon b goes to another detector D b . Now in front of each slit we place a quarter-wave plate (QWP), an optical device which transforms linearly polarized light into circularly polar ized light. The quarter-wave plates are set so that horizontally polarized a -photon acquires left circular polarization if it goes through the first slit and right circular polarization if it g oes through the second slit. For ver- tically polarized a -photon the circular polarization outcomes after the passa ge trough QWP covered slits are reversed. Note that now a -photons are marked: by measuring their circular polarization we can tell which slit they passed through prov ided the linear polarization of the a -photon is known before the quarter-wave plates. This latte r information is encoded into the polarization of the entangled b -photon. – According to quantum mechanics – said Wu-k’ung in exciteme nt – this which-way information should destroy the interference and the interf erence fringes must go away. Is this really so? – You can’t have any doubt that experiment confirms this expec tation, – answered the Patriarch. – It is not necessary to actually measure the pola rizations of a − and b -type photons to destroy the interference pattern. The principal possibility of performing such measurements does suffice. – How do these photons then know that we could find out which sli t the a -photon went through? – exclaimed Wu-k’ung. – And I suspect we can change t he polarization of the b -photon before it strikes the detector D b and, therefore, erase the which-way information for the a -photon. What happens then? – Such a possibility of quantum erasure was recognized in 198 2 by Scully and Druhl [61]. In our experimental set-up we can place a polarizer in the b -beam oriented so that both horizontally and vertically polarized b -photons have an equal chances to pass it. After the b -photon passed the polarizer it no longer bears the informat ion about the polarization of the a -photon. Therefore, the which-way information has been era sed and we expect interference fringes to reappear in the coincidence counts between detec tors D a and D b . This is really what is observed in experiment [60]. A particularly impress ive situation can be obtained if the quantum erasure is combined with Wheeler’s delayed ch oice. We can simply place detector D b with polarizer in front of it far away so that photon a is registered first and then its companion photon b . The experiment clearly demonstrates that reappearance of the interference fringes does not depend on the order a and b photons are detected in [60]. – What the miracles! – Wu-k’ung did not hide his surprise. – It seems we are in a position to change the past! – This is not correct, – replied the Patriarch. – We can not cha nge the past. Our detection of the photon b does not change the point photon a had hit the detector D a earlier. “For entangled photons it is misleading and incorrect to int erpret the physical phenomena in terms of independent photons” [62]. “Of course, one might tr y to go beyond the minimalistic interpretation and give additional ontological meaning to Ψ, thereby accommodating some philosophical preconceptions or other personal biases. In doing so, one should however 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"remember van Kampen’s caveat” [63]: Everybody is free to speculate, but whoever endows Ψ with more meaning than is needed for computing observable phenomena is responsible for the c onsequences. He has the duty to show that his speculations do not lead to contradictions, an d preferably that they are of some use (other than agreement with preconceived philosophical views). If he does not succeed he should not blame quantum mechanics [64]. – But are you indeed comfortable with Wheeler’s suggestion t hat “the past has no exis- tence except as it is recorded in the present?” – asked Wu-k’u ng. – Do you really think that the photon during its journey in the interferometer is “a gre at smoky dragon which is only sharp at its tail (at the beam splitter 1) and at its mouth wher e it bites the detector?” [65]. I heard Bohmian mechanics offers an alternative explanation of these strange delayed choice experiments [66, 67], maybe more comfortable with the commo n sense, but at the expanse of introducing mysterious pilot-wave. In any case, do you re ally not find that the world view quantum mechanics suggests us is very strange? – “we always have had (secret, secret, close the doors!)” – an swered the Patriarch, – “We always have had a great deal of difficulty in understanding the world view that quantum mechanics represents. At least I do, because I’m an old enoug h man that I haven’t got to the point that this stuff is obvious to me. Okay, I still get nervou s with it. And therefore, some of the younger students . . . you know how it always is, every ne w idea, it takes a generation or two until it becomes obvious that there’s no real problem. It has not yet become obvious to me that there’s no real problem. I cannot define the real pro blem, therefore I suspect there’s no real problem, but I’m not sure there’s no real prob lem” [68]. 4 Wu-k’ung doubts Darwinian evolution Wu-k’ung’s progress in physics was really impressive and th e Patriarch was glad and very proud of his pupil. But things began to change when time came t o study Darwinian evolution. – “It is settled, as well as anything in science is ever settle d, that the adaptations of living things on Earth have come into being through natural s election acting on random undirected inheritable variations” [69]. – The Patriarch w as about to lose his temper after repeatedly trying to convince Wu-k’ung in Darwinian evolut ion. – How can you, – persisted Wu-k’ung – how can you, a wise man, to believe that one species can be obtained from others through random mutation s? A simple estimate shows that this is impossible [70]. A genome represents an ordered set of about N = 3 × 10 9 nucleotides. The nearest neighboring species have N 1 ≈ 0 . 01 N different nucleotides. There are C N 1 N = N ! N 1 !( N − N 1 )! possibilities to choose N 1 locations from N available in the genome and only one is the right one. Besides, you need to have right n ucleotides at those locations. We have four nucleotides used in the genetic code. Therefore for each nucleotide in the old genome at N 1 locations we have three variants to change it by a different nu cleotide and only one is what we want. This means there is ( 1 3 ) N 1 probability that all replaced nucleotides turn out to be right ones. In overall, the probability that a p ure chance transforms a valid genome into another valid genome is p = 1 3 N 1 N 1 !( N − N 1 )! N ! . You can already suspect that it is an exceedingly small numbe r, but let us estimate it [70] 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"by using Stirling’s formula ln ( N !) ≈ N ln N − N , valid for large numbers. The result is ln p ≈ − 2 × 10 8 . Therefore the probability that our reckless reliance on ch ance succeeds is negligibly small, p ≈ exp ( − 2 × 10 8 ). Is it not too foolish to assume that the proliferation of diversity we observe in biota was created in this manner? In f act there is some variation of genomes within one species with characteristic distance N 2 ≈ 0 . 001 N between subspecies. Therefore we have somewhat underestimated the probability p , but only slightly [70], and this can not help either. – Such estimates are too simplistic and misleading, – the Pat riarch turned crimson with fury. – Much more elaborated arguments of this kind were give n by Fred Hoyle [71]. And what? Darwinians simply dismissed these arguments stating that “Hoyle’s objections were frankly silly, reflecting an embarrassing misunderstandin g of Darwinian logic” [72]. – It’s a pity that Darwinians simply ignored Hoyle’s argumen ts, – replied Wu-k’ung. – I find them at least thought provoking. Take, for example, his histone-4 story. Histone-4 is an important eukaryotic protein that binds and folds DNA and is necessary for chromosome condensation during cell division. It has about one hundred amino acids in its structure and remains remarkably unchanged during known history of ev olution: although plants and animals are separated by more than one billion years of evolu tion their histone-4 molecular sequences differ in only two amino acids [73]. The fact that ev olution has not produced many different functional forms of histone-4 during billion years possibly indicates that the molecular sequence of histone-4 is essentially unique a nd can not be changed without destroying its biological function. However, then we face a difficult question how evolution had found this unique sequence of amino acids in the first plac e. The probability for the right sequence of one hundred amino acids to appear suddenly by mer e chance is very small you can guess, and Hoyle claims that the histone-4 protein could never be produced by evolution in small steps either because all intermediate steps are non -functional. – You are again hasty in your logical conclusions, – retorted the Patriarch. – Histone-4 is not as stable as you think. Some time ago histone-4 sequenc es from thirteen species of ciliates were analyzed and it was found that they differ from o ne another at as many as 46% of their amino acids [74]. It is true that in most other euk aryotes this protein has highly conserved character. This can be explained as an exam ple of purifying selection. Most proteins require a thermodynamically stable suitable three-dimensional structure to function. Protein folding depends crucially upon its amino -acid sequence. Many mutations destabilize rather than stabilize histone-4 structure. It is not surprising, therefore, that this structure was conserved during evolution in light of histon e-4’s important role in cell division. Compared with other eukaryotes, ciliates have two function ally distinct genomes in within and one of micro-nucleus is transcriptionally inactive. Th is presence of two functionally distinct genomes may allow more rapid evolution of histone- 4 genes in ciliate lineages [74]. It is true that determining factors of protein evolution rat es demand serious studies and an integrated view of protein evolution is only emerging now [7 5]. As for evolution, “it is absolutely safe to say that if you mee t somebody who claims not to believe in evolution, that person is ignorant, stupid or ins ane (or wicked, but I’d rather not consider that)”. “We are not talking about Darwin’s particu lar theory of natural selection. It is still (just) possible for a biologist to doubt its impor tance, and a few claim to. No, we are here talking about the fact of evolution itself, a fact that is proved utterly beyond reasonable doubt” [76]. – My dear Master, – begin Wu-k’ung, – I don’t question evoluti on. The question is how 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"to explain it. Darwinian evolution rests upon the following main principles [77] • Undirected, random variation is the main process that provi des the material for evo- lution. • Evolution proceeds via natural selection by fixation of the r are beneficial variations and elimination of deleterious variations. • The beneficial changes that are fixed by natural selection are ’infinitesimally’ small, so that evolution is gradual and proceeds via the accumulation of these tiny modifications. It would be quite remarkable if these simple principles real ly explain the observed diversity and complexity of life but do they? – And why do you doubt? – asked the Patriarch. – “Time is in fact the hero of the plot. The time with which we have to deal is of the order of two b illion years. What we regard as impossible on the basis of human experience is mean ingless here. Given so much time, the ”impossible” becomes possible, the possible prob able, and the probable virtually certain. One has only to wait: time itself performs the mirac les” [78]. – I think the supposition that time makes it possible the ”imp ossible” to become possible is seductive but fallacious, – answered Wu-k’ung. – Take, fo r example, the typing monkeys parable. Do you really think ”that a half-dozen monkeys prov ided with typewriters would, in a few eternities, produce all the books in the British Muse um? Strictly speaking, one immortal monkey would suffice” [79], so I can try this enterpri se after I learn from you how to become immortal. However, I doubt strongly I can ever succ eed. For simplicity let us take only one aphorism, allegedly attributed to Francis Bacon, f rom the treasure of the British Museum: “Atheism is a thin layer of ice over which one person m ay cross, but a whole people would fall into an abyss.” If my count is correct, it co ntains 109 letters, punctuation marks and spaces. A typewriter has about 50 keys. Therefore t here are 50 109 ≈ 1 . 5 × 10 185 different combinations of keys which are 109 characters long and I will have a probability of about 10 − 185 to type the correct one just by chance. Even if you take 10 80 immortal monkeys (10 80 is the number of baryons in the visible universe) each of them producing a variant of our 109-character string in every 10 − 23 seconds (which is the characteristic time of strong interactions) you still will need about 10 82 s ≈ 3 × 10 74 years to type this sole sentence with certainty. Do their typewriters endure such a time span? Pos sibly not. Due to quantum tunneling, on a time scale of 10 65 years even the most rigid materials behave like a liquid [80]. Therefore, atoms constituting the typewriters will s pread around like the molecules of water. Besides, protons are expected to be unstable due to (at least) quantum gravity effects with a typical lifetime of about 10 45 years [81] and in 10 74 years all 10 80 baryons in the visible universe will decay. There is no way for monkeys t o substitute Shakespeare! – But this is not at all required! – the Patriarch was seemingl y angry. – Using your typing monkeys analogy, more realistic picture of evolutio n might be the following. You offer a string of text (already meaningful in real evolution) to a herd of monkeys which duplicate the string although with some mistakes. After a ge neration an invisible hand of natural selection inspects the output and selects the str ing with greatest “fitness” (the meaning of fitness depends on the concrete situation. In comp uter simulation [82] the phrase with greatest resemblance with the target phrase was select ed – the situation more akin to artificial selection). This slightly improved phrase is aga in offered to the herd for duplication. Generation after generation the fitness increases and it was demonstrated [82] that such 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"“artificial selection” reaches the target phrase in reasona ble time from even meaningless start-up. Of course, this example is given only to demonstra te the power of cumulative selection over the random search and is not a realistic model of evolution. But it indicates that the evolution driven by natural selection, after all, m ight be not as improbable process as you stupid probabilities indicate. – Very good, – replied Wu-k’ung. Realistic or not you have por trayed some model of evolution. Why not elaborate it a bit more and try on computer ? Some earlier computer simulations of this kind led to conclusions that “it seems to require many thousands, perhaps millions, of successive mutations to produce even the easie st complexity we see in life now. It appears, naively at least, that no matter how large the pro bability of a single mutation is, should it be even as great as one-half, you would get this prob ability raised to a millionth power, which is so very close to zero that the chances of such a chain seem to be practically non-existent” [83]. – An accurate computer simulation of the evolution process i s extremely difficult, – answered the Patriarch. – Too many uncontrollable factors a re involved in real evolution. The computer simulations you mention were intended as merel y the zeroth approximation to the problem. They modeled only mitosis in absence of sexua l reproduction and really showed that the expected progress was much too slow. “Howeve r, and most biologists realize it anyway, the Darwinian mechanism together with mixing of g enes accelerate enormously the rate of acquiring new ”favorable” characteristics and l eave the possibility of sufficiency of the orthodox ideas quite open” [84]. Anyway, fossil evide nce of evolution is enormous and indicates that it really has occurred. We see continual chan ge and increase in complexity if fossils are arranged according to their age. – That’s true, – agreed Wu-k’ung. – But I do not think this fact proves Darwinian evolu- tion beyond any doubt. Consider, for example, the following analogy [85]. Take my programs of magnetic field calculation which I develop while studying classical electrodynamics. You can not deny that they have many similarities and show a stead y increase in complexity over time. Initially these programs were able to deal with on ly some simple two-dimensional problems. Over the years many new capabilities have appeare d to mention among others an ability to crack difficult three-dimensional problems and fancy curved coil configurations, as well as a development of user-friendly interactive inter face and graphical tools. Any of these changes have not happened gradually but appeared sudd enly in new versions. These improvements required hundreds of interrelated new lines i n the program and I never could produce them would I so foolish to try do this by a trial-and-e rror method without advance planning. In fact any “point mutations” is deleterious and c atastrophic in the case of pro- gramming languages because “no currently existing formal l anguage can tolerate random changes in the symbol sequences which express its sentences . Meaning is almost invariably destroyed. Any changes must be syntactically lawful ones.” I can not see any reason why the language of DNA programming should be different in this re spect. “I would conjecture that what one might call ”genetic grammatically” has a deter ministic explanation and does not owe its stability to selection pressure acting on random variation” [86]. – Frankly speaking, – continued Wu-k’ung, – I’m pretty sure t hat Darwinian version of evolution is quite dead in light of modern findings. None of the three main principles underlying Darwin’s approach withstand close inspection. Darwin considered ‘infinitesimal variation’, or point mutations in modern terms, as the main p rocess that provides the ma- terial for evolution. The real finding, however, is that poin t mutations due to chemical and 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"physical insults to the genome are almost always deleteriou s and catastrophic. This fact can hardly came as a big surprise for computer scientists and software engineers with their highly rigid programming languages. However, for proponen ts of Darwinian evolution “it has been a surprise to learn how thoroughly cells protect the mselves against precisely the kinds of accidental genetic change that, according to conve ntional theory, are the sources of evolutionary variability” [87]. It seems Darwin considered gradualism as very important for his theory. In chapter six of his famous On the Origin of Species he states “If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been fo rmed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down ” [77]. But now we know that evolution is anything but gradual and is better described as ‘punctuated equilibrium’. For most of the time sexually reproducing species experience ve ry little if any change as witnessed by fossil record. Then abruptly new species appear rapidly i n rare events usually associated with some natural catastrophe. The rise and fall of the dinos aurs is a good example. A study of tetrapod footprints and skeletal material reveal ed that large theropod di- nosaurs appeared less than 10,000 years after the Triassic- Jurassic boundary and less than 30,000 years after the last Triassic taxa, synchronous with a terrestrial mass extinction which wiped out at least half of the species living on Earth at that t ime [88]. The presence of an iridium anomaly and a fern spore spike suggests that a bolide impact was the possible cause [88]. The time scale of the appearance of large theropod dino saurs is the blink of an eye in geological terms. Then dinosaurs dominated on Earth for n ext 135 million years until another bolide impact ended the reign of dinosaurs 65 millio n years ago and marked the rise of mammalian age. Now about natural selection which according to Darwin is the main driving force of evo- lution. “Evolutionary-genomic studies show that natural s election is only one of the forces that shape genome evolution and is not quantitatively domin ant, whereas non-adaptive pro- cesses are much more prominent than previously suspected” [ 77]. The picture that emerged if far more complex and pluralistic than Darwin could imagin e at his time. “In addition to point mutations that can be equated with Darwin’s ‘infinites imal changes’, genome evolu- tion involves major contributions from gene and whole genom e duplications, large deletions including loss of genes or groups of genes, horizontal trans fer of genes and entire genomic re- gions, various types of genome rearrangements, and interac tion between genomes of cellular life forms and diverse selfish genetic elements” [77]. – Science is not a religion, – answered the Patriarch, – and it does not stick dogmas. Of course modern science shows that evolution is much more comp lex than previously thought. However, “the emerging landscape of genome evolution inclu des the classic, Darwinian nat- ural selection as an important component” [77]. As for the ‘p unctuated equilibrium’, this is precisely what you can expect in analogy with phase transiti ons in physics [89]. “The theory of punctuated equilibrium is a minor gloss on Darwinism, one which Darwin himself might well have approved if the issue had been discussed in his day” [82]. “Depicting the change in the widest strokes possible, Darwi n’s paramount insight on the interplay between chance and order (introduced by natural s election) survived, even if in a new, much more complex and nuanced form, with specific contri butions of different types of random processes and distinct types of selection reveale d. By contrast, the insistence on adaptation being the primary mode of evolution that is appar ent in the Origin , but especially in the Modern Synthesis, became deeply suspicious if not out right obsolete, making room 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"for a new worldview that gives much more prominence to non-ad aptive processes” [77]. An interplay between chance and order can produce quite rema rkable and strange outputs those origins are difficult to explain in retrospect. Take, fo r example, a bizarre mating behaviour of praying mantis. “If you have got a female mantis alone in a cage, and put in a male, that male instantly freezes. The praying mantis, lik e a lot of other animals, such as frogs, don’t seem to be able to see anything unless it moves. T he male knows that, and he is watching the female very carefully. If she looks away for a mo ment, he takes a hasty few steps forward. Then he freezes again as soon as she looks back. This can go on for hours. If the male is fortunate, he reaches the female, mounts her, and goe s through a normal copulation. Incidentally, once an American male mantis starts copulati ng, the female never bothers him. It’s our better standard of living. But often the female sees him first. With that, she grabs him, always by the head. Then she begins to eat him, always sta rting with his head. As soon as she has eaten off the head, the male goes into a very inte resting pattern of behavior. He plants his front feet squarely and begins to circle around them, meanwhile going through violent copulatory motions, because once the male loses his head, the copulatory center is released. In this way such a headless male will frequently su cceed in mounting the female and going through a normal copulation” [90]. – Yes, – said Wu-k’ung, – real evolution is full of mysteries. Another enigmatic example of evolution is the origin of bats [91]. There are two distinc t groups of these flying mammals, namely megabats and microbats. The question is whether thes e two groups originated from a common flying ancestor or they have separate origins. Megab ats share many features of brain organization with primates and these features are a bsent in microbats. This fact suggests a common ancestor for megabats and primates. But if true, this scenario implies that wings evolved twice, once very early in microbats and th en again later in a branch of primates leading to megabats [91]. Another alternative is t hat microbats and megabats are monophyletic and the primate brain features evolved twice, once in primates and once in megabats [91]. In either case we have to face the fact that evo lution has found the same solution twice which is difficult to expect from the random pro cess. – I think, – continued Wu-k’ung, – “there are far more unresol ved questions than answers about evolutionary processes, and contemporary science co ntinues to provide us with new conceptual possibilities” [87]. Especially interesting a re indications that all cells possess biochemical abilities for cutting and splicing of their DNA molecules into new sequence arrangements. Cells perform some kind of genetic engineeri ng! “In other words, genetic change can be massive and non-random. Some organisms, such a s the ciliated protozooan Oxytricha, completely reorganize their genetic apparatus within a single cell generation, fragmenting the germ-line chromosomes into thousands of pi eces and then reassembling a particular subset of them into a distinct kind of functional genome” [87]. The picture that emerges is quite different from the Darwinian view of evoluti on, but is far more fascinating and realistic. If the natural genetic engineering [87, 92] i s the main driving force of evolution then it is not impossible that nearly all ingredients of Lego -like genome architecture were already present billions of years ago in first living cells kn own to us. Complexity has not been increased during evolution, it became only apparent, l ike the complexity of an aircraft which is hidden in technical blueprints and documentation b ut becomes apparent during the construction. “Together with the realization that genome c ontraction is at least as common in evolution as genome expansion, and the increase of genomi c complexity is not a central evolutionary trend, the concept of non-adaptive genome evo lution implies that the idea of 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"evolutionary progress can be safely put to rest” [77]. – “Most biologists now agree that natural selection is the ke y evolutionary force that drives not only evolutionary change within species but also the origin of new species. Al- though some laypeople continue to question the cogency or ad equacy of natural selection, its status among evolutionary biologists in the past few dec ades has, perhaps ironically, only grown more secure “ [93], – answered the Patriarch indignant ly. – “The status of natural selection is now secure, reflecting decades of detailed empi rical work. But the study of nat- ural selection is by no means complete” [93]. I think any doub t in natural evolution will wither with time, although I do not exclude that maybe we need somewhat broader view of natural selection including genetic engineering and oth er modern findings. However, “no one seriously doubts that natural selection drives the evol ution of most physical traits in liv- ing creatures - there is no other plausible way to explain suc h large-scale features as beaks, biceps and brains” [93]. – I seriously doubt that natural selection drives the evolut ion, – replied Wu-k’ung. – But now I’d like to speak about another conundrum recognized by E rwin Schr ̈odinger many years ago [94]. In statistical physics order emerges from disorde r because number of particles are huge. On the background we always have the chaos of thermal mo tion. The expectation of the ’naive physicist’, according to Schr ̈odinger, is that a n organism and all the biologically relevant processes must have extremely many-atomic struct ure to be safeguarded against haphazard single-atomic events attaining too great import ance. In reality, however, “in- credibly small groups of atoms, much too small to display exa ct statistical laws, do play a dominating role in the very orderly and lawful events within a living organism” [94]. I think the resolution of this enigma how do cells manage to fu nction incredibly reliable and regular manner under constant Brownian bombardment, li es in the fact that cells are dynamic, integrated systems. No part of the cell makes sense outside the context established for the whole cell. Cells are holistic systems and their part s show extreme cooperation and coordination, accompanied with the extraordinary smart pr oofreading and error correction systems. Cells continually monitor their external and inte rnal environment, perform infor- mation processing and make decisions how to react on various challenges. Impressive picture, is not it? Just one small example that biological information process ing is a reality [92]. The bac- terium E. coli can discriminate between glucose and lactose and it can cont rol the expression of the lactose metabolic proteins so that they are only synth esized once glucose is no longer available. In fact cells execute the following logical inst ruction: “IF lactose present AND glucose not present AND cell can synthesize active LacZ and L acY, THEN transcribe lacZYA from lacP” which involves many molecules and compartments o f the cell, not just DNA and DNA binding proteins [92]. One naturally expects the devices capable to perform such co mplicated tasks to be ir- reducibly complex. They are bound to have some minimal compl exity in order to function reliably under a thermal environment. This is just simple st atistical physics. There are good indications that LUCA, the Last Universal Common Ancestor f rom which every living cell on the planet has descended, was as complex as any present-da y bacterium. And how this miraculously complex first cell come into existence over thr ee billions years ago? – This is the origin of life problem, – replied the Patriarch, – different from the problems of evolution. – It is, – agreed Wu-k’ung. – But let us return to the problem of cooperation in the cell. 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Why not to go one step further. Why not to expect that bacteria l and microbial colonies also use cooperative behaviour to cope environmental hazar ds? – I must admit that you are true, – said the Patriarch. – “To fac e changing environ- mental hazards, bacteria resort to a wide range of cooperati ve strategies. They alter the spatial organization of the colony in the presence of antibi otics for example. Bacteria form complex patterns as needed to function efficiently. Bacteria modify their colonial organi- zation in ways that optimize bacterial survival. Bacteria h ave collective memory by which they track previous encounters with antibiotics. They coll ectively glean information from the environment, communicate, distribute tasks, perform d istributed information processing and learn from past experience” [95]. – In this case, – said Wu-k’ung, – we have to conclude that “the take-home lesson of more than half a century of molecular microbiology is to reco gnize that bacterial information processing is far more powerful than human technology” [96] . – I suspect, – continued Wu-k’ung, – this cooperative behavi our in its essence is not a re- sult of evolution but was present from the very beginning, at the time of LUCAs. Combined with natural genetic engineering and horizontal gene trans fer, this primordial biological infor- mation processing, perhaps, paved a way for subsequent evol ution according to some in-built templates. “Such gradual refinement through the horizontal sharing of genetic innovations would have led to the generation of a combinatorial explosio n of genetic novelty, until the level of complexity, as exemplified perhaps by the multiple l evels of regulation, required a transition to the present era of vertical evolution” [97]. I t is true that most fellow scientist today are hero worshipers, and Darwin is undoubtedly their h ero. Quite deservedly, I think, because historically Darwin’s theory had a tremendous impa ct on science. But in the long run, hero-worship makes no good and harms the science. Thus, I “regard as rather regret- table the conventional concatenation of Darwin’s name with evolution, because there are other modalities that must be entertained and which” some sc ientists “regard as mandatory during the course of evolutionary time” [97]. 5 Wu-k’ung reflects on intelligent design The Patriarch was indignant at Wu-k’ung’s stubbornness not to accept Darwinian view of life. – I see you are inclined towards the intelligent design theor y, – said he louringly to Wu-k’ung. – If LUCA was really as complex as modern bacteria, not to spea k about the alleged cooperative behaviour of these first microorganisms with in -built evolutionary templates, which quite may turn as mere my fantasy, – begin Wu-k’ung his a nswer, – I see no way how it can emerge from inanimate matter without intelligent des igners behind. – And who were these designers? – asked the Patriarch sarcast ically. – I admit, “an honest man, armed with all the knowledge available to us now, could only state that in some sense, the origin of life appears at the moment to be almo st a miracle, so many are the conditions which would have had to have been satisfied to g et it going” [98]. But this gives no excuse to plunge into religious insinuations. Or ma ybe you prefer Crick and Orgel’s directed panspermia theory? They speculated that the LUCA, “the primitive form of life was deliberately planted on the Earth by a technologically adva nced society on another planet” [99]. Cute theory. But actually it does not solve the origin- of-life problem, except enlarging 32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"the available resources involved from Earth to, maybe, enti re cosmos. The problem is the origin of these aliens which seeded the Earth. This remember ed me a notorious story. A well- known scientist (some say it was Bertrand Russell) once gave a public lecture on astronomy. He described how the earth orbits around the sun and how the su n, in turn, orbits around the center of a vast collection of stars called our galaxy. At the end of the lecture, a little old lady at the back of the room got up and said: ”What you have told us is rubbish. The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant tortoise .” The scientist gave a superior smile before replying, ”What is the tortoise standing on?” ” You’re very clever, young man, very clever,” said the old lady. ”But it’s turtles all the way down!” [100]. How can you escape this infinite reduction puzzle? – Were I human, – answered Wu-k’ung, – I probably would say tha t intelligence and spirituality are primordial properties of Cosmos, and appl y to God as the ultimate origin of life. But I’m humble monkey, without in-built religious ins tincts. So I’m bound to answer that I don’t know. However, – continued Wu-k’ung, – “as biochemists discover m ore and more about the awesome complexity of life, it is apparent that its chances o f originating by accident are so minute that they can be completely ruled out. Life cannot hav e arisen by chance” [101]. ”Although the tiniest bacterial cells are incredibly small , weighing less than 10 − 12 grams, each is in effect a veritable micro-miniaturized factory con taining thousands of exquisitely designed pieces of intricate molecular machinery, made up a ltogether of one hundred thou- sand million atoms, far more complicated than any machinery built by man and absolutely without parallel in the non-living world” [102]. How can I be lieve that this marvelous thing, a living cell, aroused by chance? – Science is not about beliefs, – answered the Patriarch ster nly, – it’s about facts. You can not expect science to give an immediate answer to all your questions. “Just as most of the weird Cambrian monsters eventually went extinct, many c urrent hypotheses in evolution will also wither over time. Those that survive, however, wil l be inestimably powerful for explaining the natural world” [103]. The origin of life is a d ifficult problem for science today, I admit, but maybe tomorrow we will find the clue. You should ju st wait. And if you want not to passively wait but participate in the exciting proces s of scientific exploration, you must first learn a lot of already established facts and not plu nge into a bad philosophy. One of the virtues of Darwinism is that it removed teleology from our thinking. – That’s the problem, – said Wu-k’ung, – “orthodox scientist s are occupied by a fight against religion instead of finding the truth” [101]. I prefe r more sober-minded position about religion. It’s true that Darwin was successful in elim inating religious motives not only from biology but from social life also, but I doubt that the sp reading of nihilistic outlook that followed is a progressive thing. It’s an empirical fact that humans have hardwired religious instinct. You can argue about the origin of this in stinct, but It’s the fact that It’s here. And once it’s here, it should be important, because in e ven your version of genesis omnipotent natural selection picks up only important thing s. Therefore, religion must have some important regulatory function and it is not wise to thro w it away. We monkeys do not have any religion but are we wiser than men? Or do you like h uman social life to be organized in the manner monkeys do? Carl Gustav Jung once rem arked, ”Among all my patients in the second half of life, that is, over thirty-five , there has not been one whose problem in the last resort was not that of finding a religious o utlook on life. It is safe to say that every one of them fell ill because he had lost that which t he living religions of every age 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"have given their followers, and none of them has really been h ealed who did not regain his religious outlook” [104]. “Rather than accept that fantastically small probability o f life having arisen through the ‘blind’ forces of nature, it seems better to suppose that the origin of life was a deliberate intellectual act. By ‘better’ I mean less likely to be wrong” [105] – concluded Wu-k’ung. – I do not like you attitude towards biology in general and evo lution in particular, – declared the Patriarch. – ”Like entropy, which perpetually increases, educational standards perpetually worsen. And like entropy, which increases inev itably because of the policies of physics, education worsens inevitably because of the pol icies of educators. Instead of teaching being properly confined to the rote-learning of fac ts and well-proven techniques, pupils are confused nowdays by the teaching of meanings that they cannot comprehend” [105]. But you know I adhere to the high educational standard s of the past and do not tolerate premature vain attempts of illiterate pupils to en gage themselves into dubious and precarious theorizing. Unfortunately, this is precisely w hat you are doing now. Instead of studying well established biology, you are trying to answ er questions which cannot be answered without profound knowledge in biology and other sc iences. – However, – continued the Patriarch, – you have mastered phy sics quite well. So let me indicate to you that modern physics suggests a world view i n which even most unlikely events will eventually happen. I mean, of course, eternal in flation theory [106]. As a poetic metaphor, this world view is already present in th e 1941 short story of Jorge Luis Borges The Library of Babel . “The Library is unlimited and cyclical. If an eternal traveler were to cross it in any direction, after centuries h e would see that the same volumes were repeated in the same disorder (which, thus repeated, wo uld be an order: the Order)” [107]. – I could also quote this book to support my position, – remark ed Wu-k’ung in delight. He was very smart in literature in contrast to biology. – “The Library exists ab aeterno . This truth, whose immediate corollary is the future eternit y of the world, cannot be placed in doubt by any reasonable mind. Man, the imperfect libraria n, may be the product of chance or of malevolent demiurgi; the universe, with its ele gant endowment of shelves, of enigmatical volumes, of inexhaustible stairways for the tr aveler and latrines for the seated librarian, can only be the work of a god. To perceive the dista nce between the divine and the human, it is enough to compare these crude wavering symbo ls which my fallible hand scrawls on the cover of a book, with the organic letters insid e: punctual, delicate, perfectly black, inimitably symmetrical” [107]. – In less poetic terms, – the Patriarch paid no heed to Wu-k’un g’s remark, – eternal inflation looks no less fantastic [106, 108]. Eternal inflati on theory is Copernican view of the world pushed to its extreme. Before Copernicus, it was thoug ht the Earth was the center of the universe. Now we know that the Earth is just one of nine pla nets orbiting the Sun. The Sun itself is quite an ordinary star from the Milky Way galaxy which contains 100 billion other stars. The Milky Way belongs to the Vigro cluster of gal axies and lies at its periphery. The Vigro cluster by itself is a fairly average cluster that u nifies a few hundred members. There are trillions of other galaxies out there in the univer se. And now the eternal inflation theory tells us that there are infinite number of other univer ses similar to our own universe, the so called O regions [109], and many more that does not support life. Howe ver, this is not the strangest thing about the eternal inflation theory. Afte r all many universes, or multiverse, is just a huge extrapolation of the Copernican logic. The str angest thing is that while the 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"number of O regions is infinite, the number of possible coarse-grained m acroscopic histories in each of this universes is finite albeit very large [109]. An inevitable strange conclusion from this is, for example, that another macroscopically ide ntical copy of you is located at some 10 10 29 m away [108] having the same life history up to the present poi nt. Besides, if one assumes, as is usually done, that every history consiste nt with exact conservation laws has a non-vanishing probability and will eventually occur, then “some amusing situations can be entertained where distant copies of ourselves play al l sorts of different roles. Some readers will be pleased to know that there are infinitely many O -regions where Al Gore is President and - yes - Elvis is still alive” [109]. Implications of the eternal inflation theory, sometimes cal led also ’many worlds in one’ (MWO) model [109], for the origin-of-life problem were cons idered by Koonin [110]. Below I will try to summarize main points of this investigation. The hardest problem in all of biology is the origin of replica tion and translation systems. Any biological evolution is impossible without sufficiently fast and accurate genome replica- tion. However, the replication and translation systems of e ven the simplest living cells are based on the molecular machinery of tremendous complexity. This system appears to be the hardest example of ‘irreducible complexity’ [111] and no on e knows how such a system could evolve. – I remember, – said Wu-k’ung, – that the problem of self-repl ication from the quantum mechanics perspective was considered by Wigner long ago [11 2]. Wigner assumed that the self-replication process of an organism under its interact ion with the nutrient is described by some unitary “collision matrix’ S and showed that if S is a random matrix then the number of equations which describe the transformation is so much grea ter than the number of unknowns that ”it would be a miracle” [112] if the transformation equa tions were satisfied. Wigner himself finds the argument “not truly conclusive” [112] and s o do others [113, 114, 115]. However, such considerations clearly indicate that even mo derately complex self-replication organisms are not quite trivial objects expected to be found at every corner of the universe. Some even claim that “for all physics has to offer, life should never have appeared and if it ever did it would soon die out” [116]. – Yes, – said the Patriarch, – chance emergence of a sufficientl y complex biochemical system is very improbably but not impossible in MWO model. Ho yle once remarked that the chance that life could have been started in this way is com parable with the chance of a tornado sweeping through a junkyard might assemble a funct ional Boeing-747, ready to fly, from the materials therein [101]. Nevertheless, “the MW O model not only permits but guarantees that, somewhere in the infinite multiverse - more over, in every single infinite universe, - such a system would emerge” [110]. – But what about the second law of thermodynamics? – exclaime d Wu-k’ung. – “The law that entropy always increases - the second law of thermod ynamics - holds, I think, the supreme position among the laws of nature. If someone points out that your pet theory of the universe is in disagreement with Maxwell’s equations - then so much the worse for Maxwell’s equations. If it is found to be contradicted by experiments - well, these experimentalists do bungle things sometimes. But if your theory is found to be a gainst the second law of thermodynamics I can give you no hope; there is nothing for it but to collapse in deepest humiliation” [117]. I, of course, know that the second law ap plies to the closed systems only. “But the second law of thermodynamics - at least the underlyi ng principle behind this law - simply says that natural forces do not cause extremely impro bable things to happen, and it is 35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"absurd to argue that because the Earth receives energy from t he Sun, this principle was not violated here when the original rearrangement of atoms into encyclopedias and computers occurred” [85]. – In the MWO model – replied the Patriarch – extremely improba ble things do happen. This of course violates the second law. But the second law of t hermodynamics is statistical in its nature. Molecules do not gather in a one half of the vess el not because this is absolutely forbidden by exact conservation laws but because such fluctu ation is extremely improbable, much less improbable than a Shakespearean sonnet typed by a m onkey. However, in the infinite multiverse, as I already said, every event with non- zero probability will eventually happen no matter how small the probability is. I can not say th at I easily swallow this. As the origin-of-life problem is concerned, “a crucial aspect of the framework developed here is brought about by a disturbing (almost nightmarish) but inev itable question: in the infinitely redundant world of MWO, why is biological evolution, and in p articular, Darwinian selection relevant at all? Is it not possible for any, even the highest d egree of complexity to emerge by chance? The answer is ’yes’ but the question misses point. Under the MWO model, emergence of an infinite number of complex biotas by chance is inevitable but these would be vastly less common than those that evolved by the scenario that includes the switch from chance/anthropic selection to biological evolution” [110 ]. – Do you consider such explanation of the origin-of-life pro blem, “which would require happenings every bit as miraculous as the views of religious fundamentalist” [105], as really scientific? – asked Wu-k’ung. – I have a feeling that some tric kery could be always invoked when infinities come into the game, like the cunning Devil str iping us our money in a nefarious underground bar through an infinite number of transactions d uring which the amount of our money continuously increases but nothing at all is left when the super-transaction is over in a finite time [118]. – Frankly speaking, – answered the Patriarch, – I hope some le ss extravagant explana- tions, like RNA world [119], will eventually prove to be corr ect. – However, – said Wu-k’ung, – eternal inflation hypothesis is taken too seriously and is actively discussed in physics, if not in biology. You know , these theoretical “physicists behave a lot more like ’bosons’ which coalesce in large packs ” [120] towards fashionable ideas. But if you accept one aspect of the theory you have to ac cept its other consequences also. Therefore, I can not see why we can not use MWO model in bi ology if in physics it is considered to be so successful. But if we accept MWO mode l as the solution of the origin-of-life problem, an immediate inference, I’m afrai d, would be that life on the planet Earth is almost certainly the result of intelligent design. The argument is quite simple. Human civilization is at the da wn of nanotechnology. And no doubt in many pocket universes of the MWO model its twin civ ilizations already reached the level of nanotechnology which allows a production of art ificial living organisms. Sooner or later our civilization, or more precisely your civilizat ion, because I do not expect monkeys to participate appreciably in this process, except maybe so me distinguished specimens like me, sooner or later human civilization also will reach this l evel in nanotechnology and will be able not only to reproduce any living organism ever presen t on Earth, but to create new life forms. I admit, at present, “such a project would be quit e beyond our practical ability, but not beyond our comprehension. Indeed we are nearer to und erstanding what would be involved in it than a dog is to understand the construction of a power station” [105]. However, as soon as we realize that MWO model inevitably pred icts the existence of 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"infinitely many advanced civilizations capable to create ar tificial life, it becomes clear that then we find a life at some particular place in the universe it i s vastly more probable this life to be a product of nanotechnology of some advanced civil ization than the product of primordial miracle due to quantum fluctuations like Hoyle’s Boeing-747 emerging in one stroke of hurricane from the junkyard. I conclude, therefore, that the intelligent design is a vast ly more probably origin of humans than the random evolution by mutations and natural se lection. This is an inevitable conclusion of modern science if we take MWO argument serious ly and not as a merely “turtles all the way down” type hand-waving. – Wu-k’ung smiled and dis appeared in a somersault. However he returned soon to continue his speech. – In fact, – said he, – I’m curious about the nature of logical t hinking. Why the MWO model is considered as scientific and more logical than the re ligious picture of the world if it predicts happenings vastly more miraculous than described in the Bible? – Carl Gustav Jung has an interesting observation about the n ature of logical thinking, – answered the Patriarch. – He tells the following story. “Tw o anklets were found in the stomach of a crocodile shot by a European. The natives recogn ized the anklets as the property of two women who, some time before, had been devoure d by a crocodile. At once the charge of witchcraft was raised, for this quite natural o ccurrence, which would never have aroused the suspicions of a European, was given an unexpecte d interpretation in the light of one of those presuppositions which L ́evy-Br ̈uhl calls ’col lective representations’. The natives said that an unknown sorcerer had summoned the crocodile and had bidden it to bring him the two women. The crocodile had carried out the command. But what about the anklets in the beast’s stomach? The natives maintained that crocodile s never ate people unless bidden to do so. The crocodile had received the anklets from the sorc erer as a reward” [104]. For us these conclusions of aborigines seem strange and abso lutely illogical. But are they really so? In fact, ”it only strikes us in this way because we s tart from assumptions wholly different from those of primitive man. If we were as convinced as he is of the existence of sorcerers and of mysterious powers, instead of believing in so-called natural causes, his inferences would seem to us perfectly reasonable. As a matte r of fact, primitive man is no more logical or illogical than we are. His presuppositions a re not the same as ours, and that is what distinguishes him from us” [104]. – Interesting observation indeed, – agreed Wu-k’ung. – Anot her interesting observation of this kind, which shows how subtle and fragile human’s abil ity to think logically is, can be found in the Sylvia Nasar’s masterpiece [121], a splendid bi ography of John Forbes Nash, the mathematical genius and Nobel Prize winner. At the top of his scientific career, he went insane and struggled for years that followed with schizophr enia which almost destroyed both his career and his marriage. While ill, he has suffered increa singly bizarre delusions that he was the Prince of Peace and the Emperor of Antarctica, and b elieved that aliens were trying to contact him through the New York Times newspaper. Nasar describes how Nash, while in the mental hospital, explains to a colleague his acc eptance of strange ideas which for ’normal’ people appears utterly illogical. John Forbes Nash, Jr. – mathematical genius, inventor of a th eory of rational behavior, visionary of the thinking machine – had been sitting with his visitor, also a mathematician, for nearly half an hour. It was late on a weekday afternoon in t he spring of 1959, and, though it was only May, uncomfortably warm. Nash was slumped in an ar mchair in one corner of the hospital lounge, carelessly dressed in a nylon shirt that hu ng limply over his unbelted trousers. 37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"His powerful frame was slack as a rag doll’s, his finely molded features expressionless. He had been staring dully at a spot immediately in front of the le ft foot of Harvard professor George Mackey, hardly moving except to brush his long dark ha ir away from his forehead in a fitful, repetitive motion. His visitor sat upright, oppres sed by the silence, acutely conscious that the doors to the room were locked. Mackey finally could co ntain himself no longer. His voice was slightly querulous, but he strained to be gentle. “ How could you,” began Mackey, “how could you, a mathematician, a man devoted to reason and l ogical proof...how could you believe that extraterrestrials are sending you message s? How could you believe that you are being recruited by aliens from outer space to save the wor ld? How could you...?” Nash looked up at last and fixed Mackey with an unblinking stare as c ool and dispassionate as that of any bird or snake. “Because,” Nash said slowly in his soft, reasonable southern drawl, as if talking to himself, “the ideas I had about supernatural be ings came to me the same way that my mathematical ideas did. So I took them seriously” [121]. – But the power of scientific method, – said the Patriarch – its real strength that gives the science profound depth and reliability, lays in the fact tha t real science relies on experimental method. “Without experimentalist, theorist tend to drift” [122] and dwell in wild fantasies. So you beloved Intelligent Design hypothesis will remain a m ere fantasy until you can give some clues how it can be unambiguously checked by facts. – It is difficult to indicate facts that unambiguously indicat e towards Intelligent Design, it is very difficult – answered Wu-k’ung. – I can only point to so me plausible consequences of intelligent design. First of all if the evolution was pred efined by some intelligent design, I would expect the primordial cells and viruses to constitute parts of a well-thought-out and well balanced system aimed to produce increasingly complex living forms by genetic engi- neering. Natural selection, I think, could be used in some fo rm by these intelligent designers to polish required traits, but it cannot be the main driving f orce. Simply the algorithm of genetic engineering and the mechanism to accomplish it, as w ell as some meaningful simpler building blocks of genetic code, were already present in the primordial assembly of cells and viruses. I have no idea how this primordial assembly was prod uced by intelligent designers, but after all parts of the system is in place it perhaps can fun ction autonomously, without further need from the side of the intelligent designers to in terfere. I see it plausible random search algorithms to be a part of the system. But the natural selection, by its accent on competition, not cooperation, i s not the most powerful random search algorithm. Social behavior is ubiquitous in the anim al kingdom. Darwinians, of course, try to explain this by various advantages it gives fo r survival, and proudly stop at that. However, two intelligent scholars had have a deeper in sight that “once again nature has provided us with a technique for processing information that is at once elegant and versatile” [123]. They were driven by the philosophy “that a llows wisdom to emerge rather than trying to impose it, that emulates nature rather than tr ying to control it, and that seeks to make things simpler rather than more complex” [123]. As a r esult a powerful and simple random search algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO ), emerged. A key idea of this algorithm is illustrated by reference to fish schooling. “In theory at least, individual members of the school can profit from the discoveries and previous exp erience of all other members of the school during the search for food. This advantage can b ecome decisive, outweighing the disadvantages of competition for food items, whenever t he resource is unpredictably distributed in patches” [124]. So, – continued Wu-k’ung, – if something like PSO is used in ev olution, I expect orches- 38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"trated mutations to appear when, for example, bacteria deve lop drug resistance. I mean favorable mutations which appear simultaneously at differe nt places of the bacterial colony after some cell in it randomly finds the correct combination o f genetic code via genetic en- gineering. I think such mutations are hard to explain in Darw inian paradigm because they are not random but deterministic and require information sh aring between cells. – Orchestrated mutations, – said the Patriarch thoughtfull y, – you at least are making some experimentally testable prediction which you think is associated with Intelligent Design. This is good. Normal science works just in this way. A bad thin g with you Intelligent Design theory is, however, that nobody has ever seen these orchestr ated mutations in bacterial drug resistance studies. – Maybe because nobody looked for them? – answered Wu-k’ung. – By the way we can further extend this line of thought and assume that the whole biosphere should show signs of tight interconnections, fine tuning, high level of optimi zation and stability if it owe its existence to Intelligent Design. Picturesquely we can say t hat the Earth with its biosphere is one big self-regulating living system where every part ha s its specific function and pre- destination. An interesting question is what role was prede stined in this system for humans with their yet restricted intelligence and knowledge dange rously coupled to increasing awe- some ability to upset the biosphere. The only hope for monkey s is that probably the wise Intelligent Designers had anticipated a protection from fo ols, and reckless humankind will be not allowed to destroy the life on Earth. The perspective f or humans, I’m afraid, is not very good if all this is true and humans fail to correctly unde rstand their predestination - they can simply get extinct like many other species in Earth’ s history. – What you are speaking about is known for a long time as Gaia hy pothesis, – intervened the Patriarch. – The Gaia hypothesis was proposed by James Lo velock [125, 126, 127]. Gaia is Earth goddess in Greek mythology. According to Lovel ock, “the entire range of living matter on Earth from whales to viruses and from oaks to algae could be regarded as constituting a single living entity capable of maintaini ng the Earth’s atmosphere to suit its overall needs and endowed with faculties and powers far b eyond those of its constituent parts” [127]. In fact Lovelock suggests a quite sound and tes table idea that life on Earth participates in and even is the main constituent of the globa l feedback mechanisms which ensures stability of environmental conditions on Earth com fortable for life. For example, the surface temperature of Earth remained remarkably constant for eons despite the fact that the energy provided by the Sun has increased by about 30%. The atmospheric composition is also surprisingly constant instead being unstable as exp ected from the oxygen’s high chemical reactivity. The same is true for the ocean salinity which is important for most cells. Undoubtedly living organisms has played a crucial role in ma intenance of this dynamical equilibrium through “active feedback processes operated a utomatically and unconsciously by the biota” [128]. However, Lovelock’s allegory of living Earth was perceived by some scientists too literally and was fiercely attacked, especia lly by neo-Darwinians who thought it was impossible for natural selection to produce global fe edback mechanisms in physical, chemical and biological processes on Earth implied by the Ga ia hypothesis. Gaia hypothesis assumes that natural selection can produce biologically mediated feed- backs that contribute to environmental homeostasis on the g lobal scale. “In the real world, by contrast, natural selection favors any trait that gives i ts carriers a reproductive advantage over its non-carriers, whether it improves or degrades the e nvironment (and thereby benefits or hinders its carriers and non-carriers alike). Thus Gaian and anti-Gaian feedbacks are both 39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"likely to evolve” [129]. – I also share neo-Darwinians’ concerns about incapability of natural selection to produce highly integrated dynamical system on Earth’s scale, – rema rked Wu-k’ung ironically. – I’m afraid neo-Darwinians in their “Quest for the Secret of Beau ty” resemble beast-like creatures from the 1942 drawing of famous Georgian painter Lado Gudias hvili. – However, – continued Wu-k’ung, – I think there is only one po ssibility for the whole Darwin’s theory to be proved finally true. This is only possib le if we live in a computer simulation and if creators of this computer game have somewh at weird sense of humor. – In a computer simulation? – The Patriarch was startled. – I h eard Karl Svozil had some unusual ideas in this direction [130]. What do you mean? – Yes, I know about Svozil’s contribution, but the real propo nent of this weird idea is Nick Bostrom, – answered Wu-k’ung. – In fact he states that “a t least one of the following propositions is true: (1) the human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching a ’posthuman’ stage; (2) any posthuman civilization is extre mely unlikely to run a significant number of simulations of their evolutionary history (or var iations thereof); (3) we are almost certainly living in a computer simulation” [131]. The argument is simple and alike to what I used when argued tha t the intelligent design is a vastly more probably origin of humans, – continued Wu-k’ ung. – Extrapolating the progress in the present-day computer science and practice, it is not unbelievably unrealistic that enormous amounts of computing power will be available i n the future. “One thing that later generations might do with their super-powerful compu ters is run detailed simulations 40"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"of their forebears or of people like their forebears. Becaus e their computers would be so powerful, they could run a great many such simulations. Supp ose that these simulated people are conscious (as they would be if the simulations wer e sufficiently fine-grained and if a certain quite widely accepted position in the philosoph y of mind is correct). Then it could be the case that the vast majority of minds like ours do n ot belong to the original race but rather to people simulated by the advanced descendants o f an original race. It is then possible to argue that, if this were the case, we would be rati onal to think that we are likely among the simulated minds rather than among the original bio logical ones. Therefore, if we don’t think that we are currently living in a computer simu lation, we are not entitled to believe that we will have descendants who will run lots of suc h simulations of their forebears. That is the basic idea” [131]. – But what relation all this has to Darwin’s theory? – asked th e Patriarch. – Suppose the computer game the participants of which we alle gedly are is not a simple game but self-adaptive, – answered Wu-k’ung. – I mean that th e rules of this game (which we call natural laws) are not fixed forever but can change defend ing the participants’ scientific output. If a clever and original new scientific theory emerge s which does not contradict the already formed architecture of the game, this new perspecti ve immediately becomes a part of the game’s make-up. So to say, quarks have not existed befo re Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig proposed the quark model in 1964. – And now, – continued Wu-k’ung smiling, – if somebody elabor ates the Darwinian evo- lution in every detail, so that it becomes absolutely clear h ow, by what concrete mechanisms the complexity emerges and increases during the evolution, then such a theory will be un- doubtedly extremely cute and, therefore, it immediately ma terializes as part of the computer game. – The biggest irony, – added Wu-k’ung sadly, – the biggest iro ny is that under such circumstances, which require extreme intelligence from th e side of game’s designers, we will be absolutely assured that the Intelligent Design is a hoax a nd Darwin’s ideas proved to be true, while, on the contrary, just the opposite is true. – This is too much! – The Patriarch was enraged. Darwinian evo lution was his pet theory. – I’m afraid you have to leave this place forever! – Just last question, my Master, – uttered Wu-k’ung in confus ion. – I’m curios since you taught me three pillars of modern physics but was embarra ssed to ask. There were four elephants supporting the earth in the illustration you showed me. What is the fourth elephant for? – The fourth elephant is the most important, – answered the Pa triarch frowned. – It is for “utter scientific integrity” [132], utter honesty what t he scientist should be adhered to. “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself – and yo u are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you’ve n ot fooled yourself, it’s easy not to fool other scientists. You just have to be honest in a co nventional way after that” [132]. – Without this fourth elephant it is impossible to create and sustain a wealthy and sound science, – continued the Patriarch. – Some thinks an ambitio n is a driving force of science. Well, scientists are human and thus subject to all human weak ness. But without utter scientific integrity ambitions only produce “turtles all th e way down” approach and there’s a story “Yertle the Turtle” [133] by Dr. Seuss which gives the final word how this approach ultimately ends: 41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"On the far-away island of Sala-ma-Sond, Yertle the Turtle was king of the pond. A nice little pond. It was clean. It was neat. The water was warm. There was plenty to eat. The turtles had everything turtles might need. And they were all happy. Quite happy indeed. They were... until Yertle, the king of them all, Decided the kingdom he ruled was too small. ‘‘I’m ruler’’, said Yertle, ‘‘of all that I see. But I don’t see enough. That’s the trouble with me. With this stone for a throne, I look down on my pond But I cannot look down on the places beyond. This throne that I sit on is too, too low down. It ought to be higher!’’ he said with a frown. ‘‘If I could sit high, how much greater I’d be! What a king! I’d be ruler of all that I see!’’ So Yertle the Turtle King, lifted his hand And Yertle, the Turtle King, gave a command. He ordered nine turtles to swim to his stone And, using these turtles, he built a new throne. He made each turtle stand on another one’s back And he piled them all up in a nine-turtle stack. And then Yertle climbed up. He sat down on the pile. What a wonderful view! He could see ’most a mile! ‘‘All mine!’’ Yertle cried. ‘‘Oh, the things I now rule! I’m the king of a cow! And I’m the king of a mule! I’m the king of a house! And, what’s more, beyond that I’m the king of a blueberry bush and a cat! I’m Yertle the Turtle! Oh, marvelous me! For I am the ruler of all that I see!’’ And all through the morning, he sat up there high Saying over and over, ‘‘A great king am I!’’ Until ’long about noon. Then he heard a faint sigh. ‘‘What’s that?’’ snapped the king,and he looked down the sta ck. And he saw, at the bottom, a turtle named Mack. Just a part of his throne. And this plain little turtle Looked up and he said, ‘‘Beg your pardon, King Yertle. I’ve pains in my back and my shoulders and knees. How long must we stand here, Your Majesty, please?’’ ‘‘SILENCE!’’ the King of the Turtles barked back. ‘‘I’m king, and you’re only a turtle named Mack.’’ 42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"‘‘You stay in your place while I sit here and rule.

My throne shall be higher!’’ his royal voice thundered, ‘‘So pile up more turtles! I want ’bout two hundred!’’ ‘‘Turtles! More turtles!’’ he bellowed and brayed. And the turtles ’way down in the pond were afraid. They trembled. They shook. But they came. They obeyed. From all over the pond, they came swimming by dozens. Whole families of turtles, with uncles and cousins. And all of them stepped on the head of poor Mack. One after another, they climbed up the stack. Then Yertle the Turtle was perched up so high, He could see forty miles from his throne in the sky! ‘‘Hooray!’’ shouted Yertle. ‘‘I’m the king of the trees! I’m king of the birds! And I’m king of the bees! I’m king of the butterflies! King of the air! Ah, me! What a throne! What a wonderful chair! I’m Yertle the Turtle! Oh, marvelous me! For I am the ruler of all that I see!’’ Then again, from below, in the great heavy stack, Came a groan from that plain little turtle named Mack. ‘‘Your Majesty, please... I don’t like to complain, But down here below, we are feeling great pain. I know, up on top you are seeing great sights, But down here at the bottom we, too, should have rights. We turtles can’t stand it. Our shells will all crack! Besides, we need food. We are starving!’’ groaned Mack. ‘‘You hush up your mouth!’’ howled the mighty King Yertle. ‘‘You’ve no right to talk to the worlds highest turtle. I rule from the clouds! Over land! Over sea! There’s nothing, no, NOTHING, that’s higher than me!’’ But, while he was shouting, he saw with surprise That the moon of the evening was starting to rise Up over his head in the darkening skies. ‘‘What’s THAT?’’ snorted Yertle. ‘‘Say, what IS that thing That dares to be higher than Yertle the King? I shall not allow it! I’ll go higher still! I’ll build my throne higher! I can and I will! 43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"I’ll call some more turtles. I’ll stack ’em to heaven!

And he had. And that plain little lad got a bit mad. And that plain little Mack did a plain little thing. He burped! And his burp shook the throne of the king! And Yertle the Turtle, the king of the trees, The king of the air and the birds and the bees, The king of a house and a cow and a mule... Well, that was the end of the Turtle King’s rule! For Yertle, the King of all Sala-ma-Sond, Fell off his high throne and fell Plunk! in the pond! And today the great Yertle, that Marvelous he, Is King of the Mud. That is all he can see. And the turtles, of course... all the turtles are free As turtles and, maybe, all creatures should be. by Dr. Seuss 6 Final remark Seeing that there was no other alterna- tive, Wu-k’ung had to bow to the Patriarch and take leave of the congregation, ”Once you leave,” the Patriarch said, ”you’re bound to end up evildoing, I don’t care what kind of vil- lainy and violence you engage in, but I forbid you ever to mention that you are my disci- ple.
