Its origins are probably somewhere in the J.Alfred Prufrock house at Caltech, where I had the privilege of being in graduateschool. That is what we called The House, and it had several bedrooms, one ofwhich was mine. I can tell you the inhabitants of the other bedrooms were allmuch smarter and wiser than I. Most were physicists, and all went on to greatcareers. They thought hard about hard problems and they cracked many of them.What was enduring about the experience for a young neophyte like me were theaspirations of these bright men. Work on the hard problems. Work, work, work.And I did, and I have. Paradoxically, the problem I have spent my life examiningis much harder than theirs, which in a phrase is, what is the deal with humans?Oddly, they were fascinated with my problem, and at the same time, I couldn’tget to first base with the conceptual tools they used on a moment-by-momentbasis to tackle their own problems. While I used to whip my housemate, thephysicist Norman Dombey, in chess, I remain to this day not at all confidentthat I truly understand the second law of thermodynamics. In fact, I know Idon’t. Yet Norman seemed to understand everything.The atmosphere was suffused with the pervasive belief that the objective of themeaningful life is to gain insight into its mysteries. That was what was socontagious. So, here I am trying to do it again, some forty-five years later.And yet, not by myself, not by a long shot. The issue is trying to figure outwhat it means to be human. That is clear enough. So, to come out of the bullpenonce more, I tapped into all the bright young students around me.The journey started almost three years ago with my senior seminar during my lastyear at Dartmouth College. An extraordinary group of young men and women wereassigned topics I knew I wanted to explore, and they all bellied up to the barwith insights and juice. We hacked away at it for two months or so, and it wasall deeply illuminating. Two of the students caught the fever, and I am happy toreport that they are off to careers in the science of the mind.The following year, I taught my first class at the University of California,Santa Barbara, a university that doesn’t apologize for being committed toresearch and scholarship. This was a class of dedicated graduate students, andthey too deepened and added insights to the evolving story. Then a funny thinghappened.It was determined I had prostate cancer and needed surgery. Let me tell you,that is a bad hair day, even when you are bald! And yet I fell into terrificmedical hands and came through it with a good prognosis. Still, I was swampedwith work, and by luck, my sister Rebecca Gazzaniga, perhaps the finest personwho ever graced this earth, was ready to try something new. She is a physician,a botanist, a painter, a chef, a traveler, and everyone’s favorite aunt. And nowI discover she is a science junkie, a writer and editor and collaborator. A starhas been born. Without her help, this book would not exist.I have attempted to become a mouthpiece for the vast talents of many people,both students and family. I do it with pride and joy, as I still remember thatspecial imperative of the Prufrock house at Caltech: Think about the bigproblems. It is not that they are grave. They are challenging, inspiring, andenduring. See what you think."},{"pageContent":"PROLOGUE [Human_split_003.html#filepos1674]I ALWAYS SMILE WHEN I HEAR GARRISON KEILLOR SAY, “BE well, do good work, andkeep in touch.” It is such a simple sentiment, yet so full of human complexity.Other apes don’t have that sentiment. Think about it. Our species does like towish people well, not harm. No one ever says, “Have a bad day” or “Do bad work,”and keeping in touch is what the cell-phone industry has discovered all of usdo, even when there is nothing going on.There in one sentence Keillor captures humanness. A familiar cartoon withvarious captions makes its way around evolutionary biologists’ circles. It showsan ape at one end of a line and then several intermediate early humansculminating in a tall human standing erect at the other end. We now know thatthe line isn’t so direct, but the metaphor still works. We did evolve, and weare what we are through the forces of natural selection. And yet I would like toamend that cartoon. I see the human turning around with a knife in his hand andcutting his imaginary tether to the earlier versions, becoming liberated to dothings no other animal comes close to doing.We humans are special. All of us solve problems effortlessly and routinely. Whenwe approach a screen door with our arms full of bags of groceries, we instantlyknow how to stick out our pinky and hook it around the door handle to open it.The human mind is so generative and so given to animation that we do things suchas map agency (that is, we project intent) onto almost anything—our pets, ourold shoes, our cars, our world, our gods. It is as if we don’t want to be aloneup here at the top of the cognitive chain as the smartest things on earth. Wewant to see our dogs charm us and appeal to our emotions; we imagine that theytoo can have pity, love, hate, and all the rest. We are a big deal and we are alittle scared about it.Thousands of scientists and philosophers over hundreds of years have eitherrecognized this uniqueness of ours or have denied it and looked for theantecedents of everything human in other animals. In recent years, cleverscientists have found antecedents to all kinds of things that we had assumedwere purely human constructions. We used to think that only humans had theability to reflect on their own thoughts, which is called metacognition. Well,think again. Two psychologists at the University of Georgia have shown that ratsalso have this ability. It turns out that rats know what they don’t know. Doesthat mean we should do away with our rat traps? I don’t think so.Everywhere I look I see tidbits of differences, and one can always say aparticular tidbit can be found in others aspects of biological life. RalphGreenspan, a very talented neuroscientist and geneticist at the NeuroscienceInstitute in La Jolla, California, studies, of all things, sleep in the fruitfly.Someone had asked him at lunch one day, “Do flies sleep?” He quipped, “I don’tknow and I don’t care.” But then he got to thinking about it and realized thatmaybe he could learn something about the mysterious process of sleep, which haseluded understanding. The short version of this story is that flies do sleep,just as we do. More important, flies express the same genes during sleeping andwaking hours that we do. Indeed, Greenspan’s current research suggests that evenprotozoans sleep. Good grief!The point is that most human activity can be related to antecedents in otheranimals. But to be swept away by such a fact is to miss the point of humanexperience. In the following chapters, we will comb through data about ourbrains, our minds, our social world, our feelings, our artistic endeavors, ourcapacity to confer agency, our consciousness, and our growing knowledge that ourbrain parts can be replaced with silicon parts. From this jaunt, one clear factemerges. Although we are made up of the same chemicals, with the samephysiological reactions, we are very different from other animals. Just as gasescan become liquids, which can become solids, phase shifts occur in evolution,shifts so large in their implications that it becomes almost impossible to thinkof them as having the same components. A foggy mist is made up of the same stuffas an iceberg. In a complex relationship with the environment, very similarsubstances with the same chemical structure can become quite different in theirreality and form.Indeed, I have decided that something like a phase shift has occurred inbecoming human. There simply is no one thing that will ever account for ourspectacular abilities, our aspirations, and our capacity to travel mentally intime to the almost infinite world beyond our present existence. Even though wehave all of these connections with the biologic world from which we came, and wehave in some instances similar mental structures, we are hugely different. Whilemost of our genes and brain architecture are held in common with animals, thereare always differences to be found. And while we can use lathes to mill finejewelry, and chimpanzees can use stones to crack open nuts, the differences arelight-years apart. And while the family dog may appear empathetic, no petunderstands the difference between sorrow and pity.A phase shift occurred, and it occurred as the consequence of many thingschanging in our brains and minds. This book is the story of our uniqueness andhow we got here. Personally, I love our species, and always have. I have neverfound it necessary to lessen our success and domination of this universe. So letus start the journey of understanding why humans are special, and let’s havesome fun doing it.> > A NOTE ON SOURCE DOCUMENTATIONThe notes for this book were formatted according to the style documented in thePublication Manual of the American Psychological Association.

Rakic, “Great Issues for Medicine in the Twenty-First Century,”> > Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 882 (1999), p. 66.THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGIST DAVID PREMACK ONCE LAMENTED, “Why is it that the [equallygreat] biologist E. O. Wilson can spot the difference between two differentkinds of ants at a hundred yards, but can’t see the difference between an antand a human?” The quip underlines strong differences of opinion on the issue ofhuman uniqueness. It seems that half of the scientific world sees the humananimal as on a continuum with other animals, and others see a sharp breakbetween animals and humans, see two distinct groups. The argument has beenraging for years, and it surely won’t be settled in the near future. After all,we humans are either lumpers or splitters. We either see the similarities orprefer to note the differences.I hope to illuminate the issue from a particular perspective. I think it israther empty to argue that because, say, social behavior exists in humans and inants, there is nothing unique about human social behavior. Both the F-16 and thePiper Cub are planes, both obey the laws of physics, both can get you from placeA to place B, but they are hugely different. I want to begin by simplyrecognizing the huge differences between the human mind and brain and otherminds and brains, seeing what structures, processes, and capacities are uniquelyhuman.It has always been a puzzle to me why so many neuroscientists become agitatedwhen someone raises the question of whether or not there might be uniquefeatures to the human brain. Why is it that it is easy to accept that there arevisible physical differences that make us unique, but to consider differences inour brains and how they work is so touchy? Recently, I asked a fewneuroscientists the following question, “If you were recording electricalimpulses from a slice of the hippocampus in a dish and you were not told if theslice came from a mouse, a monkey, or a human, would you be able to tell thedifference? Put differently, is something unique about the human neuron? Would afuture brain carpenter have to use that kind of neuron to build a human brain orwould a monkey or mouse neuron do? Don’t we all assume there is nothing uniqueabout the neuron per se, that the special tricks of being human will come in thesubtleties of the wiring diagram itself?”The intensity of the response can be captured with just a couple of the replies.“A cell is a cell is a cell. It’s a universal unit of processing that onlyscales in size between the bee and the human. If you scale appropriately amouse, monkey, or human pyramidal cell you won’t be able to say the differenceeven if you had Pythia to help you.” So there! When we are studying the neuronsof a mouse or an ant, we are studying mechanisms no different from a humanneuron, period, end of story.Here’s another response: “There are differences in the types of neurons within abrain, and response properties of neurons within a brain. But across mammals—Ithink a neuron is a neuron. The inputs and outputs of that neuron (and synapticcomposition) determine its function.” Bang! Once again the physiology of theanimal neuron is identical to that of a human. Without this assumption, it makeslittle sense to be studying these neurons so arduously. Of course there aresimilarities. But are there no differences?Humans are unique. It is the how and the why that have been intriguingscientists, philosophers, and even lawyers for centuries. When we are trying todistinguish between animals and humans, controversies arise and battles arefought over ideas and the meaning of data, and when the smoke clears, we areleft with more information on which to build stronger, tighter theories.Interestingly, in this quest, it appears that many opposing ideas are proving tobe partially correct.Although it is obvious to everyone that humans are physically unique, it is alsoobvious that we differ from other animals in far more complex aspects. We createart, pasta Bolognese, and complex machines, and some of us understand quantumphysics. We don’t need a neuroscientist to tell us that our brains are callingthe shots, but we do need one to explain how it is done. How unique are we, andhow are we unique?How the brain drives our thoughts and actions has remained elusive. Among themany unknowns is the great mystery of how a thought moves from the depths of theunconscious to become conscious. As methods for studying the brain have becomemore sophisticated, some mysteries are solved, but it seems that solving onemystery often leads to the creation of many more. Brain imaging studies havecaused some commonly accepted tenets to come into question and others to becompletely discounted. For example, the idea that the brain works as ageneralist, processing all input information equally and in the same manner andthen meshing it together, is less well accepted than it was even fifteen yearsago. Brain imaging studies have revealed that specific parts of the brain areactive for specific types of information. When you look at a tool (a man-madeartifact created with a specific purpose in mind), your entire brain is notengaged in the problem of studying it; rather there is a specific area that isactivated for tool inspection.Findings in this realm lead to many questions. How many specific types ofinformation are there, each with its own region? What is the specificinformation that activates each region? Why do we have specific regions for onetype of activity and not another? And if we don’t have a specific region forsome type of information, what happens then? Although sophisticated imagingtechniques can show us what part of the brain is involved with specific types ofthoughts or actions, these scans tell us nothing of what is going on in thatpart of the brain. Today the cerebral cortex is thought to be “perhaps the mostcomplex entity known to science.”1The brain is complicated enough on its own, but the sheer number of differentdisciplines* [Human_split_041.html#filepos1426263] that are studying it hasproduced thousands of domains of information. It is a wonder that order can beput to the mountain of data. Words used in one discipline often carry differentmeanings in others. Findings can become distorted through poor or incorrectinterpretation and become unfortunate foundations or inaccurate rebuttals oftheories that may take decades to be questioned and reevaluated. Politicians orother public figures can oftentimes misinterpret or ignore findings to support aparticular agenda or stifle politically inconvenient research altogether. Thereis no need to be dispirited, though! Scientists are like a dog with a bone. Theykeep gnawing away, and sense is being made.Let’s start on our quest into human uniqueness the way it has been done in thepast—by just looking at that brain. Can its appearance tell us anything special?> > BIG BRAINS AND BIG IDEAS?Comparative neuroanatomy does what the name implies. It compares the brains ofdifferent species for size and structure. This is important, because in order toknow what is unique in the human brain, or any other, for that matter, one needsto know how the various brains are alike and how they differ. This used to be aneasy job and didn’t take much in the way of equipment, maybe a good saw and ascale, which was about all that was available up until the middle of thenineteenth century. Then Charles Darwin published his Origin of Species, and thequestion of whether man had descended from apes was front and center.Comparative anatomy was in the limelight, and the brain was center stage.Throughout the history of neuroscience, certain presumptions have been made. Oneof these is that the development of increased cognitive capacity is related toincreased brain size over evolutionary time. This was the view held by Darwin,who wrote, “The difference between man and the higher animals, great as it is,is certainly one of degree and not of kind,”2 and by his ally, neuroanatomist T.H. Huxley, who denied that humans had any unique brain features other thansize.3 The general acceptance of this notion, that all mammalian brains have thesame components but that as the brain grew larger, its performance became morecomplex, led to the construction of the phylogenetic scale that some of uslearned in school, with man sitting at the top of an evolutionary ladder, ratherthan out on the branch of a tree.1 However, Ralph Holloway, now a professor ofanthropology at Columbia University, disagreed. In the mid-1960s, he suggestedthat evolutionary changes in cognitive capacity are the result of brainreorganization rather than changes in size alone.4 This disagreement about howthe human brain differs from those of other animals, and indeed how the brainsof other animals differ from each other—whether in quantity or inquality—continues.Todd M. Preuss, a neuroscientist at Yerkes National Primate Research Center,points out why this disagreement is so controversial and why new discoveries ofdifferences in connectivity have been considered “inconvenient.”1 Manygeneralizations about cortical organization have been based on the “quantity”assumption. It has led scientists to believe that findings using models of brainstructure found in other mammals, such as rats and monkeys, can be extrapolatedto humans. If this is not correct, there are repercussions that reverberate intomany other fields, such as anthropology, psychology, paleontology, sociology,and beyond. Preuss advocates comparative studies of mammalian brains rather thanusing the brain of a rat, say, as a model for how a human brain functions but ona lesser scale. He and many others have found that, on the microscopic level,mammalian brains differ widely from one another.5Is this assumption about quantity correct? It would appear not. Many mammalshave larger brains than humans in terms of absolute brain size. The blue whalehas a brain that is five times larger than a human brain.6 Is it five timessmarter? Doubtful. It has a larger body to control and a simpler brainstructure. Although Captain Ahab may have found a whale intellectuallystimulating (albeit he was dealing with a sperm whale, whose brain is alsolarger than a human’s), it has not been a universal experience. So perhapsproportional (allometric) brain size is important: That is the size of the braincompared to the size of the body, often called relative brain size. Calculatingbrain-size differences this way puts a whale in its place, with a brain sizethat is only .01 percent of its body weight, compared to a human brain, which is2 percent of body weight. At the same time, consider the pocket mouse’s brain,which is 10 percent of its body weight. In fact, in the early nineteenthcentury, Georges Cuvier, an anatomist, stated, “All things being equal, thesmall animals have proportionately larger brains.”6 As it turns out,proportional brain size increases predictably as body size decreases.Human brains, however, are four to five times larger than would be expected foran average mammal of comparable size.7 In fact, in the hominid (ape) line ingeneral (from which humans have evolved), brain size has increased much fasterthan body size. This is not true for other groups of primates, and the humanbrain has rocketed in size after the divergence from chimpanzees.8 Whereas achimp’s brain weighs about 400 grams, a human’s brain is about 1,300 grams.6 Sowe do have big brains. Is this what is unique and can explain our intellect?Remember Neanderthals? Homo neanderthalensis had a body mass comparable to thatof Homo sapiens,9 but with a slightly larger cranial volume, measuring 1,520cubic centimeters (cc) compared to the 1,340 cc typical of modern humans—so theytoo had a larger relative brain size than humans. Did they have a similarintelligence to humans? Neanderthals made tools and apparently imported rawmaterials from distant sites; they invented standardized techniques for makingspears and tools10 and about 50,000 years ago began to paint their bodies andinter their dead.11 These activities are considered by many researchers toindicate some self-awareness and the beginnings of symbolic thought,6 which isimportant because that is believed to be the essential component of humanspeech.12 No one knows the extent of their speech capabilities, but what isclear is that Neanderthal material culture was not nearly as complex as that ofcontemporaneous Homo sapiens.13, 14 Although the bigger brain of theNeanderthals was not as capable of that of Homo sapiens, it was clearly moreadvanced than that of a chimp. The other problem with the big-brain theory isthat Homo sapiens’ brain size has decreased about 150 cc over the species’history, while their culture and social structures have become more complex. Soperhaps relative brain size is important, but it is not the whole story, andsince we are dealing with “perhaps the most complex entity known to science,”that should not surprise us at all.From my own perspective on this issue, I have never been taken with thebrain-size argument. For the past forty-five years I have been studyingsplit-brain patients. These are patients who have had the two hemispheres of thebrain surgically separated in an effort to control their epilepsy. Followingtheir surgery, the left brain can no longer communicate meaningfully with theright brain, thus isolating one from the other. In effect, a 1,340-graminterconnected brain has become a 670-gram brain. What happens to intelligence?Well, not much. What one sees is the specialization that we humans havedeveloped over years of evolutionary change. The left hemisphere is the smarthalf of the brain. It speaks, thinks, and generates hypotheses. The right braindoes not and is a poor symbolic cousin to the left. It does, on the other hand,have some skills that remain superior to those on the left, especially in thedomain of visual perception. Yet, for present purposes, the overarching point isthat the left hemisphere remains as cognitively adept as it was before it wasdisconnected from the right brain, leaving its 670 grams in the dust. Smartbrains are derived from more than mere size.Before we leave the question of brain size, there is some exciting newinformation from the field of genetics. Genetics research is revolutionizingmany fields of study, including neuroscience. For those of us who are naturalselection fans, it seems reasonable to assume that the explosion in human brainsize is the result of natural selection, which works through many mechanisms.Genes are functional regions on chromosomes (microscopic threadlike structuresthat are found in the nucleus of all cells and are the carriers of hereditarycharacteristics), and those regions consist of DNA sequences.*[Human_split_042.html#filepos1426832] Sometimes these sequences vary slightly,and as a result, the effect of that particular gene can vary in some way. Thesevariant sequences are called alleles. Thus, a gene coding for flower color canvary in its DNA base pairs and result in a different flower color. When anallele has a highly important and positive effect on an organism such that itimproves the organism’s survival fitness or allows it to reproduce more, thereis what is called a positive selection or directional selection for that allele.Natural selection would favor such a variant, and that particular allele wouldquickly become move common.While not all genes’ functions are known, there are many genes involved with thedevelopment of the human brain that are different from those of other mammals,and specifically from those of other primates.†[Human_split_043.html#filepos1427397] During embryonic development, these genesare involved in determining how many neurons there will be, as well as how bigthe brain will be. There is not much difference among species in the genes thatdo routine “housekeeping” in the nervous system, which are those that areinvolved in the most basic cellular functions, such as metabolism and proteinsynthesis.15 However, two genes have been identified that are specificregulators of brain size: microcephalin16 and ASPM (the abnormal spindle-likemicrocephaly-associated gene).17‡ [Human_split_044.html#filepos1427673] Thesegenes were discovered because a defect in them causes a problem that is passedon through birth to other family members. Defects in either of these genes leadto primary microcephaly, an autosomal recessive*[Human_split_045.html#filepos1429139] neurodevelopmental disorder. Two principalfeatures characterize this disorder: a markedly reduced head size that is theconsequence of a small but architecturally normal brain, and nonprogressivemental retardation. The genes were named for the disease that they cause if theyare defective.† [Human_split_046.html#filepos1429913] It is the cerebral cortex(remember this point) that shows the greatest size reduction. In fact the brainsize is so markedly decreased (three standard deviations below normal) that itis comparable in size to that of early hominids!18Recent research from the laboratory of Bruce Lahn, a professor of genetics atthe University of Chicago and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, has shownthat both of these genes have undergone significant changes under the pressureof natural selection during the evolution of Homo sapiens. Microcephalin(without the defect) showed evidence of accelerated evolution along the entireprimate lineage,19 and ASPM (also without the defect) has evolved most rapidlyafter the divergence of humans and chimpanzees,20 implicating these genes as thecause of the rapidly exploding brain size of our ancestors.Accelerated evolution means what it sounds like. These genes were hot items thatproduced a characteristic that gave its owners an obvious competitive advantage.Whoever had them had more offspring, and the genes became dominant. Not restingon these findings, these researchers wondered if these genes could answer thequestion whether the human brain is continuing to evolve. It turns out that theycould, and it is. The geneticists reasoned that if a gene has evolved adaptivelyin the making of the human species, like these genes that increase brain size,then it may still be doing so. How do you figure this out?Scientists compared the genetic sequences of ethnically and geographicallydiverse people from around the world and found that the genes that code for thenervous system had some sequence differences (known as polymorphisms) amongindividuals. By analyzing human and chimpanzee polymorphism patterns andgeographical distributions, using genetic probabilities and various othermethods, they found evidence that some of these genes are experiencing ongoingpositive selection in humans. They calculated that one genetic variant ofmicrocephalin arose approximately 37,000 years ago, which coincides with theemergence of culturally modern humans, and it increased in frequency too rapidlyto be compatible with random genetic drift or population migration. Thissuggests that it underwent positive selection.21 An ASPM variant arose about5,800 years ago, coincident with the spread of agriculture, cities, and thefirst record of written language. It, too, is found in such high frequencies inthe population as to indicate strong positive selection.22This all sounds promising. We’ve got the big brains. Some of those big brainshave discovered at least some of the genes that code for the big brains, and thegenes appear to have changed at key times in our evolution. Doesn’t this meanthey caused it all to happen and that they are what make us unique? If you thinkthe answer is going to be found in the beginning of the first chapter, you arenot using that big brain of yours. We don’t know if the genetic changes causedthe cultural changes or were synergistic,23 and even if they did, what exactlyis going on in those big brains and how is it happening? Is it happening only inours or is it happening, but to a lesser extent, in our relatives the chimps?*[Human_split_047.html#filepos1430193]> > BRAIN STRUCTUREThe structure of the brain can be looked at on three different levels: regions,cell types, and molecules. If you recall, I said that neuroanatomy used to be aneasy job. The eminent experimental psychologist Karl Lashley once advised mymentor, Roger Sperry, “Don’t teach. If you have to teach, teach neuroanatomy,because it never changes.” Well, things have changed. Not only can sections ofthe brain be studied under the microscope with numerous different stainingtechniques that all reveal different information, but also a whole host of otherchemical methods can be used, such as radioactive tracing, fluorescence, enzymehistochemical and immunohistochemical techniques, all sorts of scanners, and onand on. What is limiting now is actual material to study. Primate brains aren’teasy to come by. Chimpanzees are on the endangered species list, gorilla andorangutan brains aren’t any more abundant, and although there are an abundanceof humans with brains, few seem to want to part with theirs. Many studies doneon some species are invasive and terminal, not popular with Homo sapiens.Imaging studies are difficult to do on nonhuman species. It is so hard to get agorilla to lie still. Even so, there are many tools, and even though hugeamounts of information are being learned, not all that can be known is known. Infact, only a very small amount is known for sure. While this is great forneuroscientists’ job security, the wide gaps in knowledge allow for speculationand differing opinions.> > Brain RegionsWhat do we know about the evolution of the brain? Has the entire brain increasedin size equally, or have only specific areas of it increased?Some definitions will be helpful. The cerebral cortex is the outer portion ofthe brain, about the size of a large dish towel that is pleated and laid overthe rest of the brain. It consists of six layers of nerve cells and the pathwaysthat connect them. The enlargement of the cerebral cortex accounts for most ofthe difference in the size of the brain between humans and other primates. Thecortex is highly interconnected. Of all brain connections, 75 percent are withinthe cortex; the other 25 percent are input and output connections to other partsof the brain and nervous system.6The neocortex is the evolutionarily newer region of the cerebral cortex and iswhere sensory perception, generation of motor commands, spatial reasoning,conscious thought, and, in us Homo sapiens, language take place. The neocortexis divided anatomically into four lobes—the frontal lobe and three posteriorlobes—the parietal, the temporal, and the occipital. Everyone agrees that inprimates, including humans, the neocortex is unusually large. The neocortex of ahedgehog is 16 percent of its brain by weight; in the Galago (a genus of smallmonkey) it is 46 percent; and in a chimpanzee, 76 percent. The neocortex inhumans is even larger.6What does it mean when part of the brain has enlarged? In proportionalenlargement, all the parts are equally enlarged. If the brain is twice as large,every individual part of the brain is twice as large. In disproportionateenlargement, one part has enlarged more than the others. Usually, as brainregions change in size, their internal structure also changes, just like abusiness organization. You and your buddy build a new gizmo and sell a few ofthem. Once they become popular, you need to hire more people to make them, andthen you need a secretary and a sales rep, and eventually you need specialists.This also happens in the brain. As an area enlarges, it can produce subdivisionswithin a part of a structure that specializes in a particular activity. What isactually increasing when brain size increases is the number of neurons, but thesize of the neurons is relatively constant among species. A neuron hasconnection capability to a limited number of other neurons. So although thenumber of neurons increases, they cannot increase the absolute number ofconnections each one makes. What tends to happen is that, as absolute brain sizeincreases, the proportional connectivity decreases. Every neuron cannot connectto every other one. The human brain has billions of neurons that are organizedinto local circuits. If these circuits are stacked like a cake, they make upcortical regions; if they are bunched rather than stacked, they are callednuclei. Regions and nuclei are also interconnected to form systems. GeorgeStriedter6 at the University of California at Irvine suggests that size-relatedchanges in connectivity may limit how large brains can become without beingincoherent, and this may be the driving force behind evolutionary innovationsthat overcome this problem. Fewer dense connections force the brain tospecialize, create local circuits, and automate. In general, though, accordingto Terrence Deacon, professor of biological anthropology and neuroscience at theUniversity of California at Berkeley, the larger the area, the better connectedit is.24Now for the controversy: Is the neocortex evenly enlarged, or are some partspreferentially enlarged, and if so, which ones? Let’s start with the occipitallobe, which contains, among other things, the primary visual, or striate,cortex. In chimps, it constitutes 5 percent of the entire neocortex, whereas inhumans it constitutes 2 percent, which is less than would be expected. How toexplain this? Did ours shrink, or did some other part of the neocortex enlarge?The striate cortex in fact is the exact size that it is predicted to be for anape of our size. It appears then, that it is unlikely that it has shrunk;rather, some other parts of the cortex have expanded.7 The controversy lies inwhich parts have expanded.The frontal lobe, until recently, was thought to be proportionally larger inhumans than other primates. Earlier investigations of this subject were based onstudies done on nonprimates, for the most part on non-ape primates, andinconsistent nomenclature and landmarks for different parts of the brain wereused.25 Then Katerina Semendeferi and colleagues26 published a study in 1997comparing the sizes by volume of the frontal lobes of ten living humans withthose of fifteen postmortem great apes (six chimpanzees, three bonobos, twogorillas, four orangutans), four gibbons, and five monkeys (three rhesus, twocebus). This may seem like a small sample size, but in the world of comparativeprimate neuroanatomy it is quite large, and indeed included more samples thanall previous studies. Their data concluded that although the absolute volume ofthe frontal lobe of humans was the greatest, the relative size of the frontallobe across all the hominoids was similar. Thus they concluded that humans donot have a larger frontal lobe than expected for a primate with their brainsize.Why is this so important? The frontal lobe has much to do with thehigher-functioning aspects of human behavior such as language and thought. Ifits relative size is no bigger in humans than in the other apes, how can weexplain the increased functioning, such as language? These researchers had foursuggestions: 1. The region may have undergone a reorganization that includes enlargement of selected, but not all, cortical areas to the detriment of others. 2. The same neural circuits might be more richly interconnected within the frontal sectors themselves and between those sectors and other brain regions. 3. Subsectors of the frontal lobe might have undergone a modification of local circuitry. 4. Microscopic or macroscopic subsectors might have been added to the mix or dropped.25Todd Preuss argues that even if you accept that the frontal lobes did not expandout of proportion to the rest of the cortex, a distinction should be madebetween the frontal and the prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex is theanterior part of the frontal lobe. It is distinguished from the rest of thefrontal cortex by having an additional layer of neurons*[Human_split_048.html#filepos1430645] and is implicated in planning complexcognitive behaviors, in personality, in memory, and in aspects of language andsocial behavior. He suggests that the percentage of frontal to prefrontal cortexmay have changed. Preuss provides evidence that suggests that the motor cortexportion of a human’s frontal lobe is smaller than the chimp’s, implying that anexpansion of a different part of the human’s frontal cortex occurred to accountfor no overall loss in lobe size.1 In fact, Semendeferi27 confirmed that area10, in the lateral prefrontal cortex, is almost twice as large in humans as inapes. Area 10 is involved with memory and planning, cognitive flexibility,abstract thinking, initiating appropriate behavior and inhibiting inappropriatebehavior, learning rules, and picking out relevant information from what isperceived through the senses. We will learn in later chapters that some of theseabilities are much greater in humans, and some are unique.Thomas Schoenemann and colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania wereinterested in the relative amount of white matter in the prefrontal cortex.28The white matter lies beneath the cortex and is made up of nerve fibersconnecting the cortex with the rest of the nervous system. They found that theprefrontal white matter was disproportionately larger in humans than otherprimates and concluded that this suggests a higher degree of connectivity inthis part of the brain.Connectivity is important. Supposing you were to set up an organization tolocate a fugitive you suspected was driving across the country, what is the onething you would need to have happen among all the law enforcement agencies thatwould be involved? Communication. It would do no good if the police in Louisianaknew to look for a blue Toyota and didn’t tell anyone else, or a highwaypatrolman saw a suspicious car in El Paso going west, but didn’t tell the patrolin New Mexico. With a lot of incoming information, the better the communicationamong investigators, the more effective the search will be.This is also true of the prefrontal cortex. The more communication among itsdifferent parts, not only the faster it works, but the more flexible it is. Whatthat means is that some information used for one task can be applied tosomething else. The more you know, the faster your brain works. Although we mayshare the same brain structures with the chimp, we get more bang out of ourbuck, and part of the reason may be the interconnections in the prefrontalcortex.The prefrontal cortex is interesting in another way. Nonprimate mammals have twomajor regions of the prefrontal cortex, and primates have three. The originalregions, which are present in other mammals and evolved earlier, are the orbitalprefrontal region, which responds to external stimuli that are likely to berewarding, and the anterior cingulate cortex, which processes information aboutthe body’s internal state. These two work together to contribute to the“emotional” aspects of decision making.29 The new region tacked on to these iscalled the lateral or granular prefrontal cortex, and it is where area 10 is.This new region is apparently unique to primates and is concerned mainly withthe rational aspects of decision making, which are our conscious efforts toreach a decision. This region is densely interconnected with other regions thatare larger in human brains—the posterior parietal cortex and the temporal lobecortex—and outside the neocortex, it is connected to several cell groups in thedorsal thalamus that are also disproportionately enlarged, the medial dorsalnucleus and the pulvinar. George Striedter suggests that what has enlarged isnot a random group of areas and nuclei, but an entire circuit. He suggests thatthis circuit has made humans more flexible and capable of finding novelsolutions to problems. Included in this circuit is the ability to inhibitautomatic responses, necessary if one is to come up with novel responses.6Leaving the frontal lobe, where most of the research has concentrated, we can’tsay much for the temporal and parietal lobes beyond that they are somewhatlarger than expected, and they hold plenty of opportunities for PhD theses.What about the rest of the brain? Is anything else enlarged? Well, thecerebellum is enlarged. The cerebellum is located posteriorly at the base of thebrain, and it coordinates muscular activity. One part of the cerebellum, thedentate nucleus in particular, is larger than expected. This area receives inputneurons from the lateral cerebellar cortex and sends output neurons to thecerebral cortex via the thalamus. (The thalamus sorts and directs sensoryinformation arriving from other parts of the nervous system.) This isinteresting because there is growing evidence that the cerebellum contributes tocognitive as well as motor function.> > The Functional Story: Cortical AreasBesides being divided into physical parts such as lobes, the brain is alsodivided into functional units called cortical areas, which also have specificlocations. It’s interesting that Franz Joseph Gall, a German physician, firstcame up with this idea in the early 1800s. It was known as the theory ofphrenology and was later expanded by other phrenologists. Gall’s good idea wasthat the brain is the organ of the mind and that different brain areas didspecific jobs. However, it led to the bad ideas that one could read a person’spersonality and character from the size of their various brain regions, that theshape of the skull would accurately correspond to the shape of the brain (whichit does not), and that the size of these regions could be determined bypalpating the skull. Phrenologists would run their hands over a person’s skull;some even used calipers to make measurements. From these observations, theywould predict the character of the individual. Phrenology was very popular andwas used, among other things, to assess job applicants and to predict thecharacters of children. The trouble was, it didn’t work. Gall’s good idea does,though.Cortical regions have neurons that share certain distinguishing properties, suchas that they respond to certain types of stimuli, are involved in certain typesof cognitive tasks, or have the same microanatomy.*[Human_split_049.html#filepos1430874] For instance there are separate corticalareas that process the sensory input from the eyes (the primary visual cortex,located in the occipital lobe) and from the ears (the primary auditory cortex,located in the temporal lobe). If there is damage to a primary sensory area, oneno longer has the awareness of the sensual perception. If the auditory cortex isdamaged, one no longer has the awareness of having heard a sound but may stillreact to a sound. Other cortical areas, called association areas, integratevarious types of information. There are also motor areas, which specialize inspecific aspects of voluntary movement.Cortical areas in the frontal lobe are involved with impulse control, decisionmaking and judgment, language, memory, problem solving, sexual behavior,socialization, and spontaneity. The frontal lobe is the location of the brain’s“executive,” which plans, controls, and coordinates behavior and also controlsvoluntary movements of specific body parts, especially the hands.What exactly is going on in the cortical areas of the parietal lobe is still abit of a mystery, but they are involved with integrating sensory informationfrom various parts of the body, with visual-spatial processing, and with themanipulation of objects. The primary auditory cortex, in the temporal lobe, isinvolved in hearing, and there are other areas involved with high-level auditoryprocessing. In humans, areas in the left temporal lobe are specialized forlanguage functions such as speech, language comprehension, naming things, andverbal memory. Prosody, or the rhythm of speech, is processed in the righttemporal lobe. Areas in the ventral part of the temporal lobes also do somespecific visual processing for faces, scenes, and object recognition. The medialparts are busy with memory for events, experiences, and facts. The hippocampi,which are evolutionarily ancient structures, are deep inside the temporal lobesand are thought to be involved in the process where short-term memory getstransferred to long-term memory and also spatial memory. The occipital lobe isinvolved with vision.Since we can do so much more than those other apes, we definitely are going tofind something unique here, don’t you think? Primates have more cortical areasthan other mammals. It has been found that they have nine or more premotorareas, the portions of the cortex that plan, select, and execute motor actions,whereas nonprimates have only two to four.6 It is tempting to think that becausewe humans are higher functioning, we would have more cortical areas than otherprimates. Indeed, very recent evidence indicates that unique areas have beenfound in the visual cortex of the human brain. David Heeger at New YorkUniversity has just discovered these new areas, which are not found in otherprimates.* [Human_split_050.html#filepos1431223] For the most part, however,additional cortical areas have not been found in humans.How could it be that we don’t have more cortical areas? What about language andcogitation? And how about, well, writing concertos and painting the SistineChapel—and NASCAR, for goodness’ sake? If chimps have the same cortical areasthat we do, why aren’t they doing the same things? Shouldn’t our language areaat least be different? The answer may lie in how these areas are structured.They may be wired differently.As it turns out, while our search is getting more and more complicated, it isalso getting more interesting. Besides the fact that there is no evidence thathumans have radically more cortical areas than apes, there is increasingevidence that there are equivalent cortical areas in apes for human-specificfunctions. It appears that other primates, not just the great apes, also havecortical areas that correspond to our language areas and tool-use areas,30 andthat these areas are also lateralized, meaning that they are found predominatelyin one hemisphere rather than the other, just as they are in humans.31, 32What has been found to be unique within the human brain is in an area called theplanum temporale, which all primates have. This is a component of Wernicke’sarea, the cortical area associated with language input, such as thecomprehension of both written and spoken language.*[Human_split_051.html#filepos1431413] The planum temporale is larger on the leftside than the right side in humans, chimps, and rhesus monkeys, but it ismicroscopically unique in the left hemisphere of humans!33 Specifically what isdifferent is that the cortical minicolumns of the planum temporale are largerand the area between the columns is wider on the left side of the human brainthan on the right side, while in chimps and rhesus monkeys the columns and theintercolumnar spaces are the same size on both sides of the brain.So what have we got so far? We have brains that are bigger than expected for anape, we have a neocortex that is three times bigger than predicted for our bodysize, we have some areas of the neocortex and the cerebellum that are largerthan expected, we have more white matter, which means we probably have moreconnections, and now we have some microscopic differences in corticalminicolumns, whatever those are.> > The Brain Under a MicroscopeEvery time something is enlarged, it seems as if increased connectivity isinvolved. What are connections anyway? What are those columns? To answer that,we’re going to the microscope. Remember that the cerebral cortex has six layers.These layers can be thought of as six sheets of neurons (impulse-conductingcells) stacked on top of each other. These sheets are not arranged haphazardly,but instead the individual neurons within a sheet line up with those in thesheets above and below to form columns (aka microcolumns or minicolumns) ofcells that cross the sheets perpendicularly.33, 34, 35, 36, 37 This might soundas though it ends up looking like a wall of bricks, but these bricks are notrectangular; they are neurons known as pyramidal cells because of their shape.They actually look like Hershey’s Kisses with hairs (dendrites) sticking outfrom them in all directions. The neurons that form these columns aren’t juststacked on each other, but also form an elemental circuit and appear to functionas a unit. It is widely accepted that neuronal columns are the fundamentalprocessing unit within the cerebral cortex,37, 38 and assembling multiplecolumns together creates complex circuits within the cortex.39, 40The cortex is organized into columns in all mammals. Along with the size of thecerebral cortex, the associated number of columns within the cortex hashistorically been a major focus of evolutionary studies seeking to explaindifferences among species. Studies done at the close of the twentieth centuryhave found that columnar cell numbers vary widely across mammalian species.Other studies have revealed that neurochemicals found within a column can alsovary, not only across species but even across cortical locations within aspecies.41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46The connectional patterns of columns also vary. OK, so we have the six distinctlayers, and they receive and send projections from and to specific sets oftargets. The deepest cortical layers, the infragranular layers numbered V andVI, mature first during development (during gestation), and the neurons withinthese layers project primarily to targets outside the cortex. The mostsuperficial layers, the supragranular layers (II and III), mature last,46projecting primarily to other locations within the cortex,47, 48, 49 and theyare thicker in primates than other species.50 Several scientists have suggestedthat the supragranular layers, and the network of connections they form betweencortical locations, participate heavily in higher cognitive functions. This isaccomplished by linking motor, sensory, and association areas. These areasreceive sensory inputs from high-order sensory systems, interpret them in thelight of similar past experiences, and function in reasoning, judgment,emotions, verbalizing ideas, and storing memory.50, 51 It is also suggested thatthe differential thickness of these layers may imply an unequal degree ofconnectivity,49, 52 which could play a role in the cognitive and behavioraldifferences among various species.43 For example: The average relative thicknessof the supragranular layer in a rodent is 19 percent, while in a primate it is46 percent.53Let’s put it another way. Picture this: Take the Hershey’s Kisses with hairssticking out from each of them and stack them on top of each other, and you havea minicolumn. Gather several stacks together in a bundle, and these bundles arethe cortical columns. Now take thousands of these bundles of Hershey’s Kissesand pack them together. How much space they are going to take up and how theyare arranged will depend on how thick each stack is, how dense the hairs arearound each stack, how many individual stacks of Kisses are in a bundle, howtightly they are packed (which is also dependent on how the Kisses will wedgetogether), how many bundles you have, and how tall the bundles are. There are alot of variables, and they all matter and ultimately are thought to contributeto our cognitive and behavioral abilities. What is determining how many Kisseswe have?The horizontal expansion of the cortical sheet (the dish towel) and alterationsto the basic structure of cortical columns are likely determined early in fetaldevelopment by altering the number and timing of cell divisions that generatecortical neurons. Cortical neurogenesis can be divided into an early and a lateperiod. The length of time and the number of cell cycles spent in the earlyperiod of cell division will ultimately determine the number of cortical columnsthat will be found in any given species.54 The length of time and the number ofcell cycles spent in the later period may determine the number of individualneurons within a cortical column. A higher number of early divisions will resultin a larger cortical sheet (bigger dish towel), and a higher number of laterdivisions will result in a higher number of neurons within an individual column.The time spent generating neurons in a given species correlates highly withsupragranular layer thickness55; thus, it is possible that changes to theabsolute time of neurogenesis and the number of cell cycles that occur duringneurogenesis dictate the pattern of the neuron sheets in a species, and the sizeof the supragranular layers. Changes in timing during the production of theneurons could produce dramatic changes in cortical structure.56, 57, 58, 59 Andwhat controls the timing? DNA. That is going to take us deep into the world ofgenetics, but we aren’t going there yet.> > The Areas of SpecializationNow that we know what minicolumns are, we are going to look at how thisasymmetry of the columns found in the planum temporale (you almost forgot aboutthat, didn’t you?) relates to function and if it really has anything to do withhumans’ being unique. The speech center is located in the left hemisphere’sauditory cortex. Acoustic stimuli are received by the ear, where they areconverted to electric impulses and sent to the primary auditory cortex, in bothhemispheres. The auditory cortex is made up of several parts, each of which havea different structure and job. For instance some neurons in the auditory cortexare sensitive to various frequencies of sound and some to loudness. The number,location, and organization of these parts in the human auditory cortex are notfully understood. As far as speech is concerned, each hemisphere is concernedwith different aspects. Wernicke’s area in the left hemisphere recognizesdistinctive parts of speech, and an area in the right auditory cortex recognizesprosody, the metrical structure of speech, which we will talk about in laterchapters, and then sends this info to Wernicke’s area.We are now entering the realm of speculation. We know for sure that the humanplanum temporale (a component of Wernicke’s area) is larger in the lefthemisphere than the right, and the microscopic architecture is different on theleft side compared to the right. The minicolumns are wider, and the spacesbetween them are greater, and this lateralized change in architecture is uniqueto humans. With the increased space between minicolumns, there is also anincrease in the spread of the dendrites from the pyramidal cells (the hairs ofthe Hershey’s Kisses), but the increase is not proportional to the increase inspacing. This results in a smaller number of minicolumns being interconnectedthan in the right hemisphere, and it has been proposed that this could indicatethat there is a more elaborate and less redundant pattern of local processingarchitecture in this area in the left hemisphere. It may also indicate thatthere is an additional constituent in this space.1 This scenario is different inthe other auditory regions. There the dendritic spread of the pyramidal cellsdid compensate for the increased spacing (that is, the hairs on the Hershey’sKisses got longer and filled in the increased space between the stacks ofKisses).The posterior language region also differs between the two hemispheres at themacrocolumn level. The two hemispheres have equal-size areas of patchyinterconnections, but the distance between the patches is greater in the lefthemisphere, indicating that there are more interconnected macrocolumns in theleft. It has been speculated that this pattern of interconnections is similar tothat in the visual cortex, where interconnected macrocolumns that processsimilar types of information are also clustered together. Thus, perhaps thepresence of greater connectivity in the posterior auditory system createssimilarly functioning clusters that can analyze incoming information on a finerscale.1So far, there is no direct evidence of hemispheric asymmetry in the connectionsbetween regions, owing to technical limitations in studying the long-distanceconnections of human brains, but there is some indirect evidence. The increaseddistance between the minicolumns could be caused partly by differences in theincoming and outgoing connections—either increases in numbers or size. There areconsistent shape differences between the two hemispheres, and long- andshort-range neurons are known to contribute to the shape of the brain’sconvolutions.And one last thing: There is an increased number of extra-large pyramidal cellsin the supragranular layer on the left side in the anterior and posteriorlanguage areas, as well as in the primary and secondary auditory locations. Manyresearchers have suggested that this is indicative of connectional asymmetriesand may play a role in temporal processing, and that is a big deal.We all know that timing is important. Just ask Steve Martin or Rita Rudner. Theleft hemisphere is better at processing temporal information. Because timing isessential to the comprehension of language, the human brain may requirespecialized connections to process it. It has even been suggested that the costsof a time delay in sending information across hemispheres has been the drivingforce in language lateralization.60> > Lateralization and ConnectivityTo be sure, the human brain is a bizarre device, set in place through naturalselection for one main purpose—to make decisions that enhance reproductivesuccess. That simple fact has many consequences and is at the heart ofevolutionary biology. Once grasped, it helps the brain scientist to understand amajor phenomenon of human brain function—its ubiquitous lateral cerebralspecialization. Nowhere else in the animal kingdom is there such rampantspecialization of function. Why is this, and how did it come about?Or, as Kevin Johnson, a friend of my sister’s, put it, “So the brain is composedof two halves that need to interact to create a working mind. Now, if we assumethat both brain and mind are the result of evolutionary forces, what is theadaptive advantage of a bicameral brain? What evolutionary force could possiblymake such a wacky arrangement adaptive?” What emerges from my own split-brainresearch is a possible insight to these questions.> > THE WACKY ARRANGEMENTIt may turn out that the oft-ignored corpus callosum, the fiber tract that isthought merely to exchange information between the two hemispheres, was thegreat enabler for establishing the human condition. The brains of other mammals,by contrast, reveal scant evidence for lateral specialization, except as rarelynoted, for example, by my colleagues Charles Hamilton and Betty Vermeire whilethey were investigating the macaque monkey’s ability to perceive faces.61 Inthat study, they discovered a right-hemisphere superiority for the detection ofmonkey faces. Lateralization is present in birds, and the question of whetherthis was a shared solution throughout the phylogenetic tree or one that wasindependently developed is under investigation. We will be talking more aboutbird brains in a later chapter.With the growing demand for cortical space, perhaps the forces of naturalselection began to modify one hemisphere but not the other. Since the callosumexchanges information between the two hemispheres, mutational events could occurin one lateralized cortical area and leave the other mutation-free, thuscontinuing to provide the cortical function from the homologous area to theentire cognitive system. As these new functions develop, cortical regions thathad been dedicated to other functions are likely to be co-opted. Because thesefunctions are still supported by the other hemisphere, there is no overall lossof function. In short, the callosum allowed a no-cost extension; corticalcapacity could expand by reducing redundancy and extending its space for newcortical zones.This proposal is offered against a backdrop of findings in cognitiveneuroscience that strongly suggest how important local, short connections arefor the proper maintenance and functioning of neural circuits.62, 63 Long fibersystems are relevant, most likely for communicating the products of acomputation, but short fibers are crucial for producing the computation inquestion. Does this mean that as the computational needs for specializationincrease, there is pressure to sustain mutations that alter circuits close to anascent site of activity?One of the major facts emerging from split-brain research is that the lefthemisphere has marked limitations in perceptual functions and the righthemisphere has even more prominent limitations in its cognitive functions. Themodel thus maintains that lateral specialization reflects the emergence of newskills and the retention of others. Natural selection allowed this odd state ofaffairs because the callosum integrated these developments in a functionalsystem that only got better as a decision-making device.Another aspect of this proposal can be seen when considering possible costs tothe right hemisphere. It now appears that the developing child and the rhesusmonkey have similar cognitive abilities.64 It has been shown that many simplemental capacities, such as classification tasks, are possible in the monkey andin the twelve-month-old child. Yet many of these capacities are not evident inthe right hemisphere of a split-brain subject.65 It is as if the righthemisphere’s attention-perception system has co-opted these capacities, just asthe emerging language systems in the left hemisphere have co-opted its capacityfor perception.As the brain becomes more lateralized, one might predict that there would be anincrease in local intrahemispheric circuitry and a reduction in interhemisphericcircuitry. With local circuits becoming specialized and optimized for particularfunctions, the formerly bilateral brain need no longer keep identical processingsystems tied together for all aspects of information processing. Thecommunication that occurs between the two hemispheres can be reduced, as onlythe products of the processing centers need be communicated to the opposite halfbrain. Researchers from Yerkes Primate Center at Emory University have reportedthat there is a differential expansion of cerebral white matter relative to thecorpus callosum in primates.66 Humans show a marked decrease in the rate ofgrowth of the corpus callosum compared with intrahemispheric white matter.The discovery of mirror neurons by Giacomo Rizzolatti, which we will talk aboutlater, may also contribute to understanding how new abilities, exclusively humanin nature, arose during cortical evolution. Neurons in the monkey’s prefrontallobe respond not only when the animal is going to grasp a piece of food but alsowhen the human experimenter is about to grasp the same piece of food.67 It wouldappear that circuits in the monkey brain make it possible for the monkey torepresent the actions of others. Studies of the mirror neuron system in humansare revealing it to be much more extensive and involved than in monkeys.Rizzolatti68 suggested that such a system might be the seed for a theory of auniquely human modular mind.69It is with this background, in which both developmental and evolutionary timecome into play, that a dynamic cortical system establishes adaptations thatbecome laterally specialized systems. The human brain is on its way to being aunique neural system.> > Molecular and Genetic DimensionsWe are almost done with our tour through the brain, but remember, we still haveto go one level smaller: molecules. We are ready to go to the land of genetics,and it is a happening place. In reality, everything that we have been talkingabout so far is the way it is because the DNA of that species has coded it to bethat way. The ultimate uniqueness of the human brain is due to our unique DNAsequence. The successful sequencing of the human and chimpanzee genomes and theblossoming of the new field of comparative genomics are giving us tantalizingglimpses of the genetic bases of the differences in phenotypic specializations,that is, observable physical or biochemical traits. Before you get toocomplacent and think that we have most of the answers, let me share this quotewith you: “The genomic changes after speciation and their biologicalconsequences seem more complex than originally hypothesized.”70 Wouldn’t youknow it? We are going to look at one specific gene and just how complex aseemingly simple change can be.> > GENETICS REVIEWBut first, we need to know a little bit more about what a gene is and what itdoes. A gene is a region of DNA that occupies a specific location on achromosome.* [Human_split_052.html#filepos1431820] Each gene is made up of acoding sequence of DNA that determines the structure of a protein, and aregulatory sequence that controls when and where the protein will be made. Genesgovern both the structure and the metabolic function of the cells. When locatedin reproductive cells, they pass their information to the next generation. Eachchromosome of each species has a definite number and arrangement of genes. Anyalteration of the number or arrangement of the genes results in a mutation tothe chromosome, but it does not necessarily affect the organism. Interestingly,very little of the DNA actually codes for proteins. Scattered along thechromosomes are larger sequences (about 98 percent of the total) of noncodingDNA, whose function is not understood. Now we can go on.> > THE LANGUAGE GENEJust like the story of microcephalin and ASPM, this one also starts in a clinicin England. Physicians there were treating a unique family (known as the KEfamily) in which many members suffered a severe speech and language disorder.They have extreme difficulties controlling complex, coordinated face and mouthmovements. This impedes their speech, and they have a variety of problems withboth spoken and written language, which includes difficulty understandingsentences with complex syntactical structure, defects in processing wordsaccording to grammatical rules, and a lower average IQ than nonaffected familymembers.71 The family was referred to the Wellcome Trust Centre for HumanGenetics in Oxford, where researchers, by looking at the family tree, found thatthe disorder was inherited in a simple fashion. Unlike other families withspeech and language difficulties, inheritance of which was far more complicated,it turned out the disorder in the KE family was a defect in a single autosomaldominant gene.72 That means that a person with the mutation has a 50 percentchance of passing it to offspring.The hunt was on for the gene. It was narrowed down to a region on chromosome 7containing between fifty and one hundred genes. Then, unlike Murphy’s Law, therecame a stroke of luck. An unrelated patient (CS) who had similar speech andlanguage problems was referred to them. CS had a chromosomal abnormality calledtranslocation. Large segments from the ends of two different chromosomes hadbroken off and had swapped positions. One of the chromosomes was chromosome 7,and the breakpoint spot was in the region of the chromosome that was implicatedin the KE family’s problems. The gene at that location on the KE chromosome 7was analyzed and found to have a single base-pair mutation.73 The base adeninewas substituted for guanine. This base-pair mutation was not found in 364 normalcontrol subjects. This mutation is predicted to result in a change in theprotein that it codes, by causing a substitution for the amino acid argininewith histidine in the forkhead DNA binding domain of FOXP2 protein. The mutationof this gene, named FOXP2, caused the problem.Why? How can one little change do so much damage? Take a deep breath. Blow itout slowly. OK, now you’re ready. There are many different FOX genes. They are abig family of genes that code for proteins that have what is known as aforkhead-box (FOX) domain. The forkhead box is a string of eighty to a hundredamino acids forming a specific shape that binds to a specific area of DNA like akey fitting into a lock. Once coupled, the FOX proteins regulate the expressionof target genes. The substitution of the amino acid histidine changed the shapeof the FOXP2 protein, so that it could no longer bind to DNA; the key no longerfit the lock.FOX proteins are a type of transcription factor. Oh no, what is that? Rememberthat a gene has a coding region and a regulatory region. The coding region isthe recipe for the construction of protein. In order for the protein to be made,the recipe in the DNA sequence has to be copied first into intermediary copiesof messenger RNA (mRNA), which are the template for protein production, by acarefully controlled process called transcription. The regulatory regiondetermines how many copies of mRNA are made, and thus the amount of protein. Atranscription factor is a protein that binds to the regulatory region of othergenes (notice that this is plural and can affect up to thousands of genes, notjust one) and modulates their transcription levels. Those with theforkhead-binding domain are specific for particular DNA sequences, so they don’tbind indiscriminately. The choice of targets may vary depending on the shape ofthe forkhead and on the cellular environment, and may either increase ordecrease transcription. The absence of a transcription factor can affect anunknown and potentially large number of other genes. You can think oftranscription factor as a switch that turns gene expression on or off for aspecific number of genes. It could be a few, or it could be 2,500. If theforkhead protein cannot bind to the regulatory region of a strand of DNA, theswitch to produce whatever that region codes for will not be turned on or off.Many forkheads are critical regulators of embryonic development that turnundifferentiated cells into specialized tissues and organs.Back to FOXP2 protein: This transcription factor is known to affect tissues inthe brain, lung, gut, heart,74 and other locations in the adult. The mutation inthe gene affected only the brain in the KE family. Remember that there are twocopies of each chromosome, and the affected members of this family have onenormal chromosome and one mutated one. It is postulated that reduced amounts ofFOXP2 protein at specific stages of neurogenesis led to abnormalities in theneural structures that are important for language and speech73 but that theamount of FOXP2 protein produced by the normal chromosome was sufficient for thedevelopment of the other tissues.If the FOXP2 gene is so important in the development of language, is it uniqueto humans? This is complicated, and the complexity speaks to huge differencesbetween talking about genes (genetics) and talking about the expression of genes(genomics). The FOXP2 gene is present in a broad range of mammals. The proteinencoded for by the FOXP2 gene differs by only three amino acids between mouseand man. It has been found that two of those differences occurred after thedivergence of the human and chimpanzee lineages.75 Thus humans do have a uniqueversion of the FOXP2 gene that produces unique FOXP2 proteins. The two mutationsin the human gene have changed the binding properties of the protein.76 This canhave a major effect on the expression of other genes. These two mutations areestimated to have occurred within the last two hundred thousand years75 and haveundergone accelerated evolution and positive selection. Whatever they do, theyprovided a competitive advantage. It is significant that this is the estimatedtime frame for the emergence of spoken language in humans.Is this it? Is this the gene that codes for speech and language? Well, let methrow in another comparative study that identified ninety-one genes that aredifferentially expressed in the human cortex compared with chimps, of which 90percent are upregulated, meaning that there are increased levels of expressionin humans.77 These genes have varying functions. Some are required for normaldevelopment of the nervous system, some are related to increased neuronalsignaling and activity, some mediate increases in energy transport, and thefunctions of others are unknown. Most likely the FOXP2 gene is one of manychanges on the pathway to language function, but what it provides is morequestions. What is this gene doing? What other genes does it affect? Did thetwo-mutation difference between humans and chimps actually cause major changesin circuitry or muscular function, and if so, how?And the story doesn’t stop here. Pasko Rakic, perhaps the world’s greatestneuroanatomist, has just described yet other new features of the developinghuman brain. In the summer of 2006, Rakic and his colleagues described new“predecessor cells” that appear prior to other cells underlying localneurogenesis.78 There is no evidence at this time that such cells exist in otheranimals.> > CONCLUSIONThe historical and current social and scientific forces maintaining the notionthat the only difference between an ape’s brain and our own is one of size,which is to say number of neurons, have been overwhelming. And yet adispassionate look at the data in front of us clearly shows that the human brainhas many unique features. In fact, the scientific literature is full of examplesthat range from the level of gross anatomy to cellular anatomy to molecularstructure. In short, as we build our case for the uniqueness of the human brain,we start on firm footing. Our brains are different in detail, so why should ourminds not also be different?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 [Human_split_003.html#filepos2519]"},{"pageContent":"WOULD A CHIMP MAKE A GOOD DATE?

Nonhumanbeings and objects take on humanness almost routinely, and we come to believe insuch things as real and enduring. We grant them a kind of agency. “Of course mydog is smart,” one hears. “My cat is psychic.” “Old Nelly never once got stuckin the snow. She knows how to hug the road.” The list is endless.Our species has had a hard time drawing the line between us and them. In theMiddle Ages, we used to have animal courts. If you can believe it, we putanimals on trial and held them accountable for their actions. From 824 to 1845,in Europe, animals did not get off scot-free when they violated the laws of man,or perhaps, just disturbed his well-being. Just like common criminals, they toocould be arrested and jailed (animal and human criminals would be incarceratedin the same prison), accused of wrongdoing, and have to stand trial. The courtwould appoint them a lawyer, who would represent them and defend them at atrial. A few lawyers became famous for their animal defenses. The accusedanimal, if found guilty, would then be punished. The punishment would often beretributive in nature, so that whatever the animal had done would be done to it.In the case of a particular pig (during those times pigs ran freely throughtowns, and were rather aggressive) that had attacked the face and pulled thearms off a small child, the punishment was the pig had its face mangled and itsforelegs cut off, and then was hanged. Animals were punished because they wereharmful. However, sometimes, if the animal was valuable, such as an ox or horse,its sentence would be ameliorated, or perhaps the animal would be given to thechurch. If the animal had been found guilty of “buggery” (sodomy), both it andthe buggerer were put to death. If domestic animals had caused damages and werefound guilty, their owners would be fined for not controlling them. There seemsto have been some ambivalence as to whether an animal was fully responsible orwhether its owner should also be considered responsible. Because animals werepeers with humans in judicial proceedings, it was considered uncool to eat thebodies of any animals that were capitally punished (except among the thriftyFlemish, who would enjoy a good steak after a cow was hanged). Animals couldalso be tortured for confessions. If they didn’t confess—and no one supposedthey would—then their sentence could be lessened. You see, it was important tofollow the law exactly, for if humans were tortured and didn’t confess, thentheir sentence could also be changed. Many different types of domestic animalshad their day in court: horses for throwing riders or causing carts to tip, dogsfor biting, bulls for stampeding and injuring or goring someone, and pigs mostcommonly of all. These trials were held in civil courts.1It is easy to see why we humans have struggled with our views of animals. As Imentioned, a feature of the human brain that is both ubiquitous and almostdefining is how we reflexively build models in our minds about the intentions,feelings, and goals of others, including animals and objects. We can’t help it.When one visits Rodney Brooks’s artificial intelligence lab at MIT and sees hisfamous robot, Cog, it takes only a matter of seconds before agency of some kindis conferred on this hunk of steel and wires. Cog turns its head, tracks youaround the room with its eyes, and bingo, Cog is a something, a somebody. If itis true for Cog, it is going to be true for Rover.Veterinarians will tell you the same sort of grieving cycles that occur overhumans do so over pets. Those remaining above the ground have a mental model ofthe deceased, and they must go through a process to put it at peace. I havecarried out extensive animal primate research. One quickly identified with eachanimal, noted its personality, its intelligence, and its cooperativeness. Theresearch frequently required carrying out major neurosurgical procedures, and insome instances, major efforts were necessary for their postoperative care. Ifound each one taxing and troubling. When the animal survived and flourishedafter surgery, one’s attachment was close indeed.I can remember one such animal that I had taken a shine to, now some forty yearsago. She needed some vitamins, and yet she hated the taste of the mixture. So Ibrought out a monkey’s favorite delicacy—the banana. I injected the vitaminmixture into one end of the banana in hopes that she would chomp into it and gether vitamins incidentally to the tasty banana. It worked once. On day two—sameplan, same preparation. This time Mozambique took the banana, looked at eachend, noticed the end that had the vitamin mixture oozing out of it, broke thebanana in two, threw the goopy end on the floor and ate the nonmedicated half! Icouldn’t believe my eyes, but I cheered her on.The problem with this story is I can’t be certain whether what I thought I sawas evidence of great mentation was really more than a chance event,overinterpreted by me and sort of lionized. Would I want to spend a lot ofmental time with Mozambique? Indeed would I want to spend a lot of time with achimp? This is where it starts to get serious and where hard work is needed toreally know what it is we have in common with chimps.

A version of the first ad can be found onsnopes.com, an “urban legends” reference page. It was supposedly placed in anAtlanta newspaper, listing a phone number that belonged to the Humane Society,which received 643 calls the first two days it was in print. Daisy was a blacklab, not even a chimp. The Humane Society denied ever placing the ad.How would these dates be different? What miscalculation would you have made ifyou found yourself facing a chimp at the door after responding to the first ad?Could you date a chimp? Would the two of you have any common ground?> > COUSINS?The physical differences and similarities between our closest relatives, thechimps, and us are, of course, quite noticeable. Just exactly what are wetalking about when we say “closest relatives”? We often hear that we share 98.6percent of our total DNA nucleotide sequence with chimpanzees. Yet, this figureis more than a little misleading. This does not mean that we share 98.6 percentof our genes with the chimps. The current estimate is that humans have 30,000 to31,000 genes. What is generally not emphasized is that these 30,000 genes occupya little more than 1.5 percent of the whole genome, the rest of the genome beingnoncoding.2, 3 Thus, the vast majority of the genome sits there—its functionlargely unknown.With only 1.5 percent of human DNA coded for genes that are crucial in buildinga human, are the geneticists telling us 98.6 percent of the 1.5 percent issimilar between the chimp and the human? No. Put differently, how can only 1.4percent of the DNA make such a huge difference? The answer is clear. Therelationship between a gene—a DNA sequence—and its ultimate function is notsimple. Each gene can express itself in many different ways, and the variationin expression can account for large differences in function.Here is the abstract from Nature magazine on the report of the sequencing of onechimpanzee chromosome:> > Human-chimpanzee comparative genome research is essential for narrowing down> > genetic changes involved in the acquisition of unique human features, such> > as highly developed cognitive functions, bipedalism or the use of complex> > language.

The lineage that later evolved tobecome orangutans branched off about 15 million years ago (mya), and thegorillas 10 mya. It is estimated that somewhere between 5 and 7 mya, we shared acommon ancestor with the chimpanzee. That is why that ape is assumed to be ourclosest living relative. For some reason, and it is often blamed on the climate,which may have caused a change in the food supply, there was a further split inour common line. One branch of the family stayed in the tropical forest, and theother branch stepped out into the open woodland. The branch that stayed in theforest resulted in the chimpanzees and later the bonobos (sometimes known aspygmy chimpanzees, although they are only slightly smaller). Bonobos branchedfrom a common chimp ancestor about 1.5 to 3.0 mya. They occupy the tropicalforests south of the Zaire River in central and western Africa, where there areno gorillas to compete for food, whereas the chimps live in the tropical forestsnorth of the Zaire with gorillas. Because the tropical forest has always beenhome to the chimpanzees, they are called a conservative species. They have nothad to adapt to many changes and thus, evolutionarily speaking, have not changedmuch since branching from our common ancestor.Not so with the open-woodland branch that left the tropical forest to live onthe savanna. They had to adapt to a radically different environment and thuswent through many changes. After a few false starts and dead ends, theyeventually evolved into Homo sapiens. Humans are the only surviving hominid fromthe line that split from the common ancestor with the chimps, but there weremany that came before us. Lucy, for example, the fossil Australopithecusafarensis found by Donald Johanson in 1974, shocked the anthropological worldbecause she was bipedal but did not have the big brain. Up until that time, itwas thought that the big brain led to bipedalism.In 1992, Tim White, from the University of California at Berkeley, found theoldest known hominid fossils. These were of a bipedal apelike animal that hasbeen called Ardipithecus ramidus and is thought to have lived about 4.4 to 7.0mya. Recent fossil findings in Ethiopia, again by Tim White, of Australopithecusanamensis, dated to 4.1 mya, suggest that it may have been the descendant ofArdipithecus and the precursor of Lucy. Several different species arose fromAustralopithecus, including the beginning of our species, Homo. However, ourdevelopment was not a straight shot from Lucy forward. There were eras whendifferent species of Homo and Australopithecus existed at the same time.> > PHYSICAL DIFFERENCESNonetheless, here we are, and the question once again is, how different are we?Now that we know that the seemingly small 1.5 percent difference in our genomemeans a lot, we can expect to find some big differences in our species.First, is bipedalism unique? The Australians are shaking their heads: kangaroos.So although humans are not the only bipedal animals, bipedalism did set inmotion a series of physical changes in the hominid line that distinguish us fromchimps. We lost our opposable first toe and developed a foot that could carryour upright weight. This has also allowed us to wear Italian designer shoes, aunique behavior known only to humans. Chimpanzees still have an opposable firsttoe, which acts similarly to a thumb and is good for grasping branches but notfor carrying upright weight. As we humans became bipedal, our legs straightened,unlike the bowed legs of a chimp. Our pelvis and hip joints changed their size,shape, and angle of connection. Our spine became curved into an S shape, asopposed to the straight spine of a chimp. The thoracic spinal foramen, thechannel that the spinal cord travels through, has enlarged, and the point wherethe spinal cord enters the skull has moved forward to the middle of our craniumrather than the rear.Robert Provine, at the University of Maryland, a researcher who studieslaughter, postulates that bipedalism actually made speech mechanically possible.In apes walking on all fours, the lungs have to be fully inflated to provide theadditional rigidity needed for the thorax to absorb the impact of the groundthrough the forelimbs while running. Bipedalism broke the link between breathingpatterns and stride, and allowed the flexibility for regulating breathing andultimately speech.5Other speech-enabling changes occurred: Necks elongated, and the tongue andpharynx dropped lower down into the throat. In chimps and other apes, the nasalpassage is directly connected to the lungs. It is completely separate from thefood route through the mouth and into the esophagus; this means that the otherapes cannot choke on their food, but we can. We have a different system, aunique system, in which air and food share a common pathway in the back of thethroat. We have developed a structure called the epiglottis, which closes offthe pathway to the lungs when we swallow, and opens when we breathe. It is theanatomy of the pharynx, specifically the larynx, that makes it possible for usto utter the huge variations in sound that we can. We must have gained somesurvival advantage even though there is an increased risk of death by choking.Was it our increased ability to communicate?> > Freeing Up the ForepawsOnce we were walking upright, we had free hands that could carry things, and ourthumbs became extraordinary. Actually, our thumbs became unique. Chimps do haveopposable thumbs, but they don’t have the range of motion that our thumbs have,and that is key. We can arc our thumbs across to our baby fingers, known asulnar opposition, but chimps cannot. This means we can pick up objects with thetips of our fingers rather than just the sides. We also have more sensitivefingertips, with thousands of nerves per square inch that send information tothe brain. This has given us the ability to perform the finest motor-coordinatedtasks not only of all the apes but also of all living creatures.According to the current fossil evidence, it seems that our hands were up andfunctioning about two million years ago in Homo habilis, whose fossils werefound in the Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania early in 1964, along with the first knownhand-wrought tools. This was another shock for anthropologists at the time,because Homo habilis had a brain about half the size of ours. It had beenthought that a bigger brain was needed for tool making. In fact, the arcingthumb was what allowed our ancestors to be able to grab objects and pound themtogether to make the first tools. Remember, tool making is not unique to humans.Chimps, crows, and dolphins have all been observed using sticks, grass, andsponges as tools. However none of them has made a Maserati, which is unique tohumans.> > The Pelvic Thing: Big Brains, Big PelvisThe change in the size of the pelvis also had big repercussions. The birth canalbecame narrower and made birth much more difficult—even as brains, and thusheads, were becoming larger. A wider pelvis would have made bipedalismmechanically impossible. In the embryo, the skulls of primates form in platesthat slide over the brain and do not coalesce until after birth. (Remember thesoft spot in the baby’s head you were warned not to touch?) This allows theskull to remain pliable enough to fit through the birth canal. Human babies areborn very much less developed than other ape babies. In fact, in comparison toother apes, we are born one year prematurely, which is why human babies are sohelpless and need to be cared for longer. The plates in our skulls don’t fullyjoin until about age thirty. Our brains are only 23 percent of their adult sizeat birth and continue to expand until adolescence.While it appears that certain aspects of our brains may continue to growthroughout our lifetime, it is most likely not due to the addition of newneurons. Instead, it is more likely that the myelin sheaths that surround theneurons continue to grow. Francine Benes, a professor of psychiatry specializingin neuroscience at Harvard Medical School and director of the Harvard BrainTissue Resource Center, has found that myelination of at least one part of thebrain* [Human_split_053.html#filepos1432593] continues into the sixth decade.6Myelination of an axon (nerve fiber) increases the propagation of the electricalsignals from the cell body to the terminal area of the neuron. She postulatesthat these axons may play a role in the integration of emotional behaviors withthe cognitive process, and that these functions may “grow” and mature throughoutadult life. It is also interesting that there is a gender effect. There isincreased myelin in females age six to twenty-nine, compared to males the sameage.As it turns out, our physical anatomy is important, and just how much it hasaffected the development of the brain, and thus our humanness, is unknown.†[Human_split_054.html#filepos1432819] But let’s get back to our date. What weare really concerned about on a date beyond the physical—which in the land ofsexual selection is a big deal—is just what makes him or her tick. What do wehave in common and what is unbridgeable? Our guy is intelligent and curious. Ishe well matched with a chimp?> > MENTAL DIFFERENCESIn the descriptions of our prospective dates there are some major differences.Our chimp date cannot talk, never gained control over fire, doesn’t cook, hasn’tdeveloped a culture of art, music, or literature, is not particularly generous,isn’t monogamous, and doesn’t grow food. However, she is attracted to a strongmate, is status conscious, is omnivorous, and likes to socialize, hunt, eatwell, and have close contact with a mate. Let’s look at these similarities anddifferences.Do chimps share some of our intelligence? Is there a difference between humanand animal intelligence? One could write an entire book on this issue, and manyhave. The field is nothing but controversial. Definitions of intelligence arecommonly given from a human’s point of view. For example, “Intelligence is ageneral mental capability that involves the ability to think abstractly,comprehend ideas and language, learn, plan, reason and solve problems.”7 But canone species’ intelligence really be compared to another’s? Perhaps a more usefuldefinition of animal intelligence is that of Hubert Markl, former president ofthe Max Planck Society in Germany, who said it is “the ability to relatedifferent unconnected pieces of information in new ways and to apply the resultsin an adaptive manner.”8Daniel Povinelli, director of the Cognitive Evolution Group and the Center forChild Studies at the University of Louisiana, addresses the problem by posingthe animal intelligence question this way: “How does thinking differ acrossspecies?”9 Or to put it another way: What kind of thinking was needed to allow aspecies to survive in the environments that it has successfully evolved in? Canyou imagine a different way of thinking? It is difficult for us to imagine howto think other than how we do; thus it is difficult to conceive of the mentalstates of other species. It is hard enough understanding the mental states ofour own species. Povinelli is concerned that psychologists have become obsessedwith establishing a psychological continuity between humans and other greatapes, and so are looking only for similarities. Indeed, he reminds us,“Evolution is real, and it produces diversity.”10 Looking at the diversity ofmental states instead of distorting “their true nature by conceiving of theirminds as smaller, duller, less talkative versions of our own”9 would perhaps netus better information. John Holmes, a trainer of border collies, stated, “A dogis not ‘almost human’ and I know of no greater insult to the canine race than todescribe it as such. The dog can do many things which man cannot do, never coulddo and never will do.”11 Indeed it is the differences that define a species andmake it unique.This presents a big problem that we face in studying chimpanzees’ mental statesand behavior. How do we do it? We can watch them in the wild: long arduous daysjust to get to where they live, followed by long, arduous, mosquito-infested,humid days trailing after them and observing them. Or we can watch them in alaboratory, where few are equipped to care for chimps, there are few chimps toexperiment on, experimental designs are limited, and chimps grow “sophisticated”as they become familiar with the experimental milieu. The scientists who watchthem in the wild say that the laboratory is too artificial, that the chimps donot behave normally there, and that they can be influenced by those running theexperiments. The laboratory scientists create a hypothesis and predictions, thendesign an experiment controlling for as many variables as they can, and recordand interpret the results. They say that those in the field have no experimentalcontrol over the situations in which a behavior is occurring and thus can’t drawan accurate causal inference. Both suffer from the fact that the interpretationsare seen through the eyes of humans, who are influenced by their own culture,politics, backgrounds, religion, and theory of mind. Keeping these limitationsin mind, we are going to look at evidence and observations from both the lab andthe field, and see just how similar and different we are.> > Theory of MindHumans have an innate ability to understand that other humans have minds withdifferent desires, intentions, beliefs, and mental states, and we have theability to form theories with some degree of accuracy about what those desires,intentions, beliefs, and mental states are. It was first called Theory of Mind(TOM) by David Premack, whom we have already met in chapter 1, and his colleagueGuy Woodruff in 1978. It was an ingenious insight. Another way to put it: It isthe ability to observe behavior and then infer the unobservable mental statethat is causing it. TOM is fully developed automatically in children by aboutage four to five, and there are signs that it is partially present before agetwo.12, 13 It appears to be independent from IQ. Children and adults with autismhave deficits in theory of mind and are impaired in their ability to reasonabout the mental states of others, yet their other cognitive abilities remainintact or increased.14, 15 When looking at the behavior of other animals, ourTOM causes us two problems. One is that we may get caught in the trap of seeinga certain animal behavior and with our TOM infer a human mental state in theanimal, leading us to an inappropriate anthropomorphic conclusion.Alternatively, we may value our TOM ability to such a degree that it is a goldstandard to which everything else is compared, leading us to think that man iscompletely separate from all other mammals. So do only humans have a theory ofmind?This is one of the major questions in chimpanzee research. Possessing a TOM isan important part of our abilities and has been argued to be uniquely human. Tounderstand that other individuals have beliefs, desires, intentions, and needsaffects how we act and react, whether out of sociability or for protection. WhenPremack and Woodruff coined the term TOM, they asked if chimps had it. Therehave been thirty years of experiments since that time, and the question has yetto be answered satisfactorily in the laboratory. In 1998, Cecelia M. Heyes fromUniversity College London did a review of all the experiments and observationsthat had been done up until that time on nonhuman primates and put them througha rigorous evaluation. These experiments studied motor imitation (thespontaneous copying of novel acts), self-recognition in a mirror, socialrelationships, role taking (the ability to adopt the viewpoint of anotherindividual), deception, and perspective taking. (The last concerns the questionwhether seeing something translates into knowing it, i.e., is there an awarenessthat others see.) She came to the conclusion that in every case where nonhumanprimate behavior had been interpreted as a sign of theory of mind, it couldinstead have occurred either by chance or as a product of nonmentalisticprocesses.16 She did not feel that the current procedures had proved ordisproved TOM in chimps, although her arguments specifically about mirrorself-recognition are not widely held. Now Povinelli and his colleague JenniferVonk have since reached the same conclusion.17But nothing is simple in a field where so much is at stake. Michael Tomaselloand his group at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology inLeipzig, Germany, have drawn a different conclusion. “Although chimpanzeesalmost certainly do not understand other minds in the same way that humans do(e.g. they apparently do not understand beliefs) they do understand somepsychological processes (e.g. seeing).”18 They feel that chimpanzees have atleast some components of TOM.If I have a belief about your mental state, and you have one about mine, theseare described as orders of intensionality. (Intensionality is used here, spelledwith an s, as was the original practice, to refer specifically to the mentalstates associated with TOM. It is distinguished from intentionality with a t,which is a type of intensionality.) I know (1) that you know (2) that I know (3)that you want me to go to Paris (4) and that I want to. In a conversation aboutintensionality, fourth order is about as far as most people can grasp, but somecan follow up to five or six orders, so I can throw in: and you know (5) I can’tand I know (6) that you know it but keep coming up with reasons to go. Whew. AsI said before, to what extent other apes have a theory of mind is still highlycontested. It is accepted that they have first-order intensionality. Manyresearchers, but not all, believe that an individual who practices tacticaldeception has second-order intensionality. They think that in order to trickanother individual, an animal has to believe that another animal believessomething. Through the compilation of multiple observational studies, RichardByrne and Andrew Whiten have shown that instances of tactical deception areextremely rare in prosimians* [Human_split_055.html#filepos1433171] and NewWorld monkeys, but are common among the socially advanced Old World monkeys andapes—especially chimps.19Although not all researchers are satisfied by observational studies, many acceptthat nonhuman primates have second-order intensionality. Scientists atTomasello’s lab have shown in a series of experiments over the last few yearsthat chimpanzees know what other chimps do and do not see, and can base theirbehavior accordingly. They will go after food that a more dominant chimp cannotsee but will not go after food that the dominant one can see, and somesubordinates even engage in strategic maneuvering, such as waiting or hiding, toobtain the food.20 We will learn more about what chimps understand about seeingin chapter 5. Tomasello has also found that they understand some things aboutthe intentions of others, specifically the difference between times when anexperimenter is unwilling versus unable to give them food.21 And chimps are moreskillful at competitive tasks than those that involve cooperation,22 but whenthey need to cooperate, they will choose a chimpanzee who was a bettercollaborator on the task in the past.23Where the chimps have failed is in a false-belief task that children can do atfour to five years old. This test has in the past been used to indicate the fulldevelopment of theory of mind. However, more recently it has been realized thatthis is rather overstating the case. As Paul Bloom at Yale University and TimGerman, when at the University of Essex, Colchester, United Kingdom, pointedout, there is more to theory of mind than the false-belief task, and there ismore to the false-belief task than theory of mind.24What is this task? It is classically called the Sally and Ann test. Nonverbally,it works like this: Sally hides a reward, such as food, in one of two identicalcontainers while Ann watches, but the subject (the child or chimp) does not.Then the subject watches Ann place a marker on the container that she believesholds the food. The child or the chimp then picks a container to get the food.They both can do this successfully. Then, Sally hides the reward again as Annwatches but the subject does not. Then the subject sees Ann leave the room andwhile she is gone, watches Sally switch the containers. Ann then comes back intothe room and marks the container that she believes the food is in (which ofcourse is the wrong one). Sometime between the age of four and five, childrenunderstand that the container that Ann thinks has the food in it has beenswitched and that Ann doesn’t know it. They understand that Ann has a falsebelief, and they will pick the correct container with the food, not the one thatAnn has marked. However, the chimps and children with autism do not understandthat Ann has a false belief, and will pick the container that she has marked.25In the last couple of years, researchers are beginning to conclude that thistest is too hard for kids under three years old. When different versions or adifferent type of test is done, even eighteen-month-to two-year-old childrenattend to mental states such as goals, perceptions, and beliefs to explain thebehavior of others.26What does this task actually show us? Why is there such a watershed changebetween three and five? What is going on in the brains of these kids thatenables them to do what a chimp cannot?Stand back or you’ll get in the fray! Controversy abounds, and two differentexplanations are being batted around. One is that there is a conceptual changein the children’s understanding of what beliefs really are as they get older:They gain a theoretical understanding of mental states,27 perhaps adomain-general mechanism of theory formation.28 In other words, the theory comesfirst, and from it concepts are derived. The other is that there is a modulartheory of mind mechanism (ToMM) that gradually emerges on a reliabledevelopmental schedule as the children get older.29, 30In bringing up modules, I am getting ahead of myself a bit, but you are going tobe hearing a lot about them soon. For now, think of a module as a hardwired(innate) mechanism that unconsciously directs you to think or act in a certainway, that directs your attention to such states as belief, desire, and pretenseand then allows you to learn about these mental states.31, 32 The proposal isthat you are born with these concepts. The concepts came first; later, you formtheories. The mechanism provides the child with a few choices of belief states,and then a secondary selection process (which is not modular and is able to beinfluenced by knowledge, circumstance, and experience) infers the underlyingmental state that gave rise to the belief state.For instance, a child would observe and pay attention to a behavior such as aperson saying, “Hmmm.” Then up pop the choices: “Well,…it could be she believesthat the candy is in the box she marked with the X and it is true, or shebelieves that but it isn’t true.” But here is the catch: The choice “Well, shebelieves that and it is true” is the default choice. This choice is alwayssupplied, is usually picked, and in general is correct. What people believe isusually true. But in some instances, others do have false beliefs, and you knowit. In such unusual situations, the default should not be selected. In order notto pick this choice, to succeed in the false-belief task, this choice must beinhibited, and there’s the rub. This is what is so difficult for the very youngand for our friends the chimps: inhibition. This theory also accounts for why weget better at attributing beliefs to others: Once we have inhibition under ourbelt, knowledge and experience help out.Tomasello does not think that chimps have a full theory of mind, but he doeshypothesize that chimpanzees “possess a social-cognitive schema enabling them togo a bit below the surface and discern something of the intentional structure ofbehavior and how perception influences it.”33 Dave Povinelli disputes thisconclusion. He does not think that their similarity in behavior reflects asimilarity in psychology. He offers his reinterpretation hypothesis, in which hesuggests that the majority of the social behaviors that humans and otherprimates have in common emerged long before the human lineage evolved thepsychological means of interpreting those behaviors in terms of second-orderintentional states.34The controversy goes on about consciousness shared with the chimp. What we shareis minimal at best, according to Povinelli: “Key aspects of the data pointtoward the possibility that if chimpanzees do have a theory of mind, it must beradically different from our own.” This leads us back to the question that heposes to begin with: How does thinking differ across species?Povinelli has a further refinement to that question: “What are their mentalstates about?” Well, they most certainly are about living in the tropicalforest. “It would stand to reason that the mental state of chimpanzees, firstand foremost, must be concerned with the things most relevant to their naturalecology—remembering the location of fruit trees, keeping an eye out forpredators, and keeping track of the alpha male.” So far, this would be a gooddate to take camping. He goes on to suggest, “In contrast to humans, chimpanzeesrely strictly upon observable features of others to forge their social concepts.If correct, it would mean that chimpanzees do not realize that there is more toothers than their movements, facial expressions, and habits of behavior.” Inshort, Povinelli believes that “for any given ability that humans andchimpanzees share in common, the two species would share a common set ofpsychological structures, which at the same time, humans would augment byrelying upon a system or systems unique to the species.”9 We will talk moreabout TOM in other animals.Another aspect of intelligence is being able to plan for the future. Besidesdoing TOM studies, Nicholas Mulcahy and Josep Call, also at the Max PlanckInstitute in Leipzig, have looked into whether other great apes can plan.Recently they published a study of five bonobos and five orangutans, findingthat they did have the ability to save a suitable tool for future use.35 Intheir study they first taught the subjects to use a tool to get a food rewardfrom an apparatus in a test room. “Then we placed two suitable and sixunsuitable tools in the test room but blocked subjects’ access to the baitedapparatus. After five minutes, subjects were ushered outside the test room intothe waiting room, and the caretaker removed all objects left in the test roomwhile subjects watched. One hour later subjects were allowed to return to thetest room and were given access to the apparatus. Thus to solve the problem,subjects had to select a suitable tool from the test room, bring it to thewaiting room, keep it there for one hour, and bring it back into the test roomupon their return.” The subjects took a tool with them 70 percent of the time.The researchers repeated the test but with a fourteen-hour delay, and thesubjects did well again. Mulcahy and Call concluded that “these findings suggestthat the precursor skills for planning for the future evolved in great apesbefore 14 million years ago, when all extant great ape species shared a commonancestor.” Maybe our chimp date will plan ahead and make a reservation.> > LANGUAGESo your chimp date may not have much of a theory about you, and as a result,anything you might do with her will be sort of viewed as being withoutintention. Nonetheless, perhaps she has feelings about her own states of mindthat she would like to tell you about. Speech, of course, is the faculty or actof expressing or describing thought, feelings, or perceptions by thearticulation of words. But chimps can’t speak. I can remember my friend StanleySchachter at Columbia always lamenting, “How can Herb Terrace*[Human_split_056.html#filepos1433390] become famous for showing chimps can’ttalk?” In the end, they just don’t have the anatomy to be able to articulate thekinds of sounds that are necessary, so talking per se is out. But that certainlydoesn’t mean they can’t communicate.Communication, quite simply, is the transfer of information by speech, signals,writing, or behavior. In the world of animal communication, it is morespecifically defined by any behavior on the part of one animal that has aneffect on the current or future behavior of another animal. An example ofinterspecies communication is when a rattlesnake shakes its rattle: It is awarning that it is going to strike. Of course, language is another type ofcommunication. It is far more complicated in its origins and abilities, and sois its definition. In fact, the definition of language is constantly in a stateof revision by linguists, to the consternation of researchers studying humanlanguage acquisition in chimps.Sue Savage-Rumbaugh, a primatologist at Georgia State University who claims apeshave a language capacity, vents her frustration: “First the linguists said wehad to get our animals to use signs in a symbolic way if we wanted to say theylearned language. OK, we did that, and then they said, ‘No, that’s not language,because you don’t have syntax.’ So we proved our apes could produce somecombinations of signs, but the linguists said that wasn’t enough syntax, or theright syntax. They’ll never agree that we’ve done enough.”36Well, language is a system of abstract symbols and the grammar (rules) in whichthe symbols are manipulated. For instance the words dog, chien, and cane allmean “dog.” The word doesn’t sound like its meaning; it is just a sound that hascome to represent “dog” in different languages. It is an abstract symbol.Language does not have to be spoken or written. It can be made with gestures,such as American Sign Language. What is complicated and always changing areopinions about the rules: what they involve and where they came from and whatcomponents, if any, of human language are unique.Syntax is the pattern of formation of sentences or phrases that governs the waythe words in a sentence come together. Human language can string phrasestogether indefinitely to produce an unlimited number of sentences that are alldifferent and have never been said before. If you speak that particularlanguage, you can understand them, because the words are organized in ahierarchical and recursive way, not just randomly. So someone with humanlanguage can make a date for a certain time and place and give you directionsabout how and when to get there. “I’ll meet you at noon in front of the museumthat is by the bank” is different from “I’ll meet you at noon in front of thebank that is by the museum.” Which is also different from the nonsense “Bank inmeet that you noon is museum by I’ll front the of at.” And why is it nonsense?It is not following the rules of grammar. If language had no syntax, we wouldjust have a bunch of words that you would string together willy-nilly. You couldget some rudimentary meaning across perhaps, but you might be unintentionallystood up. Bad for a date.How did syntax develop? A species either has the ability to learn a language orit does not, and this ability was acquired through an evolutionary process ofnatural selection. If a species can learn language, then the individual is bornwith a sense for both symbolic representation and syntax. Of course, there arethose who disagree with this theory, in two distinct ways. Some believe thatlanguage is not an innate ability but that the ability to learn it is learned.This does not refer to learning a specific language, but rather to the abilityto learn any language. In other words, this view holds that an individual doesnot spontaneously utilize syntax and symbolic representation. Others disagreeabout the evolution of language. Cognitive linguists, proponents of the“continuity” theory, argue that mental traits are subject to the same forces ofnatural selection as biological traits. “Discontinuity” theory proponents arguethat some elements of behavior and mental traits are qualitatively unique to agiven species and share no evolutionary heritage with other living species orarchaic species. Noam Chomsky, the distinguished linguist at MIT, proposes thathuman language is “discontinuous” in this sense.37Remember that what we are concerned with is looking for what is unique tohumans. Our language ability is often put on that list by others besidesChomsky. Can chimps communicate with language? This question is really askingwhether nonhuman apes can communicate with a language taught to them by humans.Early efforts to teach language to chimps were first made by David Premack whenhe was at the University of California at Santa Barbara. I know because thechimp that was being trained sort of had the office next to mine. Sarah was hername, and she was exceptionally bright. Indeed, she might have made tenure ifshe could ever have gotten the full story straight.Premack moved on to the University of Pennsylvannia and kept trying. Othersjumped into the fray, including Herbert Terrace of Columbia University. In 1979,Terrace published a skeptical account of his efforts to teach American SignLanguage to a chimp whimsically named Nim Chimpsky. Nim was able to connect asign to a meaning and could express simple thoughts, such as “give orange megive eat.” However, Nim could not form new ideas by linking signs in ways hehadn’t been taught; he didn’t grasp syntax. Terrace also reviewed the reports ofothers’ attempts to teach apes language and concluded the same thing: Theyaren’t coming up with complex sentences.This leaves us with Koko the gorilla, who supposedly was taught sign language byPenny Patterson. A problem presents itself when evaluating Koko’s abilities.Patterson, the handler, is the only interpreter of the conversations, and assuch, she is not objective. Stephen Anderson, a linguist at Yale, comments thatalthough Patterson says she has kept systematic records, no one else has beenable to study them, and that since 1982 all the information about Koko has comethrough the popular press and Internet chat sessions with Koko, Patterson actingas the interpreter and translator of her signs.36This ambiguity in interpreting sign language is what led Sue Savage-Rumbaugh touse lexigrams, which are not ambiguous.38 Savage-Rumbaugh has indeed the mosttantalizing data and a serendipitous bonobo. She used an artificial symbolsystem of graphic designs called lexigrams on a computer keyboard.She began teaching a female bonobo named Matata how to use the keyboard. Theexperimenters would press a lexigram key and point to the intended object oraction. The computer would then say the word and the key would light up. Matatahad a baby named Kanzi, who was too young at the time to be separated from hismother, so he sat in on the training sessions with Matata. Matata was not a goodpupil, and after two years, she had not learned much. When Kanzi was about twoand a half years old, Matata was moved to a different facility, and Kanzistepped into the spotlight. Although he had had no specific training, just bywatching his mother’s sessions he had learned how to use some of the lexigramson the keyboard in a systematic way!Savage-Rumbaugh decided to change tactics. Instead of doing the trainingsessions she had been using with Matata, she would just carry the keyboardaround and use it during routine activities. What has Kanzi accomplished? Well,he can match pictures, objects, lexigrams, and spoken words. He freely uses thekeyboard to ask for objects he wants and places he wants to go to. He can tellyou where he intends to go, and then he goes there. He can generalize a specificreference: He uses the lexigram for bread to mean all breads, including tacos.He can listen to an informational statement and adjust what he is doing usingthe new information. This is what Sue was referring to when she said, “First thelinguists said we had to get our animals to use signs in a symbolic way if wewanted to say they learned language.” And she is right; Kanzi did.Still, all of this begs the question of syntax. Stephen Anderson points out thatboth language production (the keyboard) and language recognition (spokenEnglish) need to be evaluated.36 Kanzi uses both keyboard and gesture, andsometimes combines the two to make a sequence. He will use a lexigram first tospecify the action, such as “tickle,” and then a pointing gesture to specify theagent—always in that order, even if he has to walk across the room to point tothe lexigram first, and then return to indicate the agent. This is an arbitraryrule that Kanzi has developed on his own.* [Human_split_057.html#filepos1433646]Anderson states that this does not yet satisfy the definition of syntax, inwhich the type of word (noun, verb, preposition, etc.), its meaning, and itsrole in the sentence (subject, object, conditional clause, etc.) all contributeto the meaning of the communication, not whether it is typed, gestured, spoken,or written.Patricia Greenfield, a linguist at UCLA who studies language acquisition inchildren and has analyzed all of Savage-Rumbaugh’s data, disagrees. She thinksthat there is syntactical structure in Kanzi’s multiword combinations.†[Human_split_058.html#filepos1433847] For instance, he can recognize word order:He understands the difference between “Make the doggie bite the snake” and “Makethe snake bite the doggie,” and he uses stuffed animals to demonstrate what thetwo mean. He can respond 70 percent of the time to unfamiliar sentences, such as“Squeeze the hot dog,” given by vocal instruction from a concealed instructor.He is the first nonhuman to demonstrate either of these abilities.Anderson remains unconvinced. He points out that when the understanding of asentence depends upon a “grammatical word,” such as a preposition, Kanzi’sperformance is poor. He seems to be unable to distinguish between in, on, ornext to, and it is unclear if he understands conjunctions, such as and, that,and which. The obvious advantage that Kanzi has as a date is that you wouldn’tbe subjected to dangling participles or terminal prepositions, as in “Where areyou going to be at?” At his current level, Kanzi has a grasp of words for visualobjects and actions. Anderson concludes, “Kanzi can associate lexigrams and somespoken words with parts of complex concepts in his mind, but words that aresolely grammatical in content can only be ignored, because he has no grammar inwhich they might play a role.”36 Although Kanzi is showing remarkable abilities,we must remember that after many years, his abilities are rudimentary.We learned in the last chapter that there are many similarities in brainstructure between humans and the other great apes, especially chimps, but wehave bigger brains, more connectivity, and that FOXP2 gene, among other things.We’ve learned that our anatomy has changed a great deal since the divergencefrom a common ancestor, allowing us to become better at vocalization. Doesn’t itmake sense that part of the wiring was already in when we diverged from thecommon ancestor, and the chimp line made use of it in one way, whereas themultitude of changes that the hominid line underwent produced something else?Sue Savage-Rumbaugh states, “The significance of Kanzi’s possession of certainelements of language is, however, enormous. As the ape brain is just one-thirdthe size of the human brain, we should accept the detection of no more than afew elements of language as evidence of continuity.”*[Human_split_059.html#filepos1434055]Are other nonhuman primates communicating with each other? Is there naturallanguage within other species? After all, as Povinelli reminds us, other specieshave evolved to communicate with each other, not with humans. Well,unfortunately, as Savage-Rumbaugh points out, Kanzi knows more about humanlanguage than humans know about bonobo language.39> > COMMUNICATION AND POSSIBLE ORIGINS OF LANGUAGEAs I promised, we are now going to look at other types of communication.Language is but one type and clearly a bit shaky. Let’s go to the forest and seewhat has been observed. Perhaps the best-known studies in intraspecies animalcommunication have been those done by Robert Seyfarth and Dorothy Cheney inAmboseli National Park in Kenya with vervet monkeys. They have found that vervetmonkeys have different alarm calls for different predators: one for snakes, onefor leopards, and one for predatory birds.40 The response to a snake call isthat the other vervet monkeys will stand up and look down; to the leopard call,they all scamper into the trees; and to the bird call, they go up against thetrunks of trees and away from the exposed ends of the branches. It was thoughtuntil recently that animal vocalizations were exclusively emotional. However, avervet does not always make an alarm call: He seldom makes it when he is aloneand is more likely to make it when with kin than with non-kin. The calls are notan automatic emotional reaction.Once again, it was David Premack who observed that it was possible for anaffective communication system, even one based entirely on emotion, to becomesemantic (i.e., conveying information other than the emotion).41 Even though ascream can be an emotional reaction, it can also convey other information. Thiswas a much contested idea for twenty years, but Seyfarth and Cheney, afterfurther investigation with the vervets, agreed with him: “Signalers andrecipients, though linked in a communicative event, are nonetheless separate anddistinct because the mechanisms that cause a signaler to vocalize do not in anyway constrain a listener’s ability to extract information from the call.”42 Theyexplain that if a call is to provide information, it has to be specific: Thesame call can’t be used for several different reasons. Also the call has to beinformative, meaning that it is made whenever a specific situation arises.43Obviously there is information being given and understood. This could representa mechanism of how language evolved.However, Seyfarth and Cheney continue to point out that the most common functionof human language is to influence the behavior of others by changing what theyknow, think, believe, or desire, but most evidence suggests that while animalvocalizations may result in a change, that is not their intention but isinadvertent. Vervet monkeys don’t appear to attribute mental states to others.For example, infant vervets often give the eagle alarm call mistakenly forpigeons. Nearby adults will look up, but they don’t give the alarm callthemselves if they don’t see an eagle. However, if the infant is the first togive an alarm call for a genuine predator, adults will sometimes look up andgive a second alarm call, but not always. With the random pattern of repeatingthe infant’s alarm call, the adults do not act as though they know that theinfant is ignorant and just learning to spot predators, by validating allcorrect calls.42There is similar data about wild chimpanzees, who do not appear to adjust theircalls to inform ignorant individuals about their location or about food.44, 45 Amother will hear her lost baby call, but she does not answer back. Meanwhile, inthe laboratory, Povinelli has found that a trained chimp cannot teach anotherchimp to pull a rope for a food reward. In short, nonhuman primates do not seemto make calls or attempt to communicate because they perceive another individualis ignorant or needs information, as a human does. If chimps had a theory ofmind, the mother might think: I hear my baby call from a distance. He must notknow where I am. I should make a call so he knows where I am. Nevertheless,chimps and other primates may recognize the effect that their calls have onbehavior: I call in a certain way, and all my buddies run up into the trees.This in no way negates the fact that information is passed; it just may not havebeen the intention of the caller. So what does this all mean for our date? Well,vocal communication from the chimp’s point of view may just be “It’s all aboutme,” which when you think about it isn’t all that different from many humandates.Chimps in the wild have been observed to communicate with a combination ofglances, facial expressions, posturing, gesturing, grooming, and vocalization,just as Kanzi uses a combination of lexigrams and gestures. All these modes leadto interesting questions about the origins of language, which have yet to beanswered. Has language evolved from hand gestures, a theory championed byMichael Corballis,46 or a combination of hand gestures and facial movements, aspostulated by Giacomo Rizzolatti and Michael Arbib?47 Or did it evolve fromvocalization alone? Or is the “big bang” theory of human language, postulated byNoam Chomsky, the correct one?The speech center in humans is located in the left hemisphere. The lefthemisphere controls the motor movements of the right side of the body.Chimpanzees exhibit preferential use of the right hand in gesturalcommunication, especially when accompanied by a vocalization,48 and baboons incaptivity have been found to gesture primarily with their right hand.49 Thereare many interesting studies of humans that show how hand gestures and languageare connected. One study of twelve congenitally blind speakers found that theygestured as they spoke at the same rate as a group of sighted people, using thesame range of gesture forms. The blind people would gesture while they spokeeven when speaking to another blind person, which suggests that gestures aretightly coupled to the act of speaking.50 Congenitally deaf people in isolatedcommunities will develop their own fully communicative hand gesture languagewith syntax.51Helen J. Neville and her colleagues at the University of Oregon have confirmedthrough functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that both Broca’sand Wernicke’s areas, the two main language-mediating areas in the left side ofthe brain that are activated when hearing people speak, are also activated indeaf signers while they watch sentences in ASL. However, when deaf subjectsread, they do not activate these regions.52 It has also been observed thatanterior lesions in the vicinity of Broca’s area produce deficits in signingitself, but more posterior lesions produce deficits in the comprehension ofsigning. Neville also found that there was more activity in the right side ofthe brain in the deaf subjects than in the hearing people. This may be becauseof the spatial aspect of signing, mostly a right-hemisphere function. A similarthing is going on in the chimp’s brain as it gestures.Now we’re going to Italy, a land famous for its hand gestures. GiacomoRizzolatti, Leonardo Fogassi, and Vittorio Gallese, from the beautiful city ofParma, first discovered mirror neurons in the premotor area (area F5) of thebrain of monkeys in 1996. These neurons fire when a monkey performs an action inwhich his hand or mouth interact with an object. They also fire when the monkeymerely sees another monkey (or human experimenter) perform the same type ofaction. Thus they are called mirror neurons. They were later also found inanother part of the monkey brain, the inferior parietal lobule.53 It isgenerally accepted that the F5 region of the monkey brain shares the sameancestry as Broca’s area in the human brain.47 Broca’s area in the human isthought to be the area for speech, and as we have seen above, for signing; thedorsal part of F5 in the monkey is an area for hand movements,54, 55 and theventral part is an area for mouth and larynx movement.56, 57 Rizzolatti andMichael Arbib, director of the University of Southern California Brain Project,suggest that the mirror system was fundamental for the development of speech,and before speech for other forms of intentional communication,47 such as facialexpression and hand gestures. Do humans have these mirror neurons? There is alot of evidence that we do.58 The cortical areas active during actionobservation in humans match those active in the monkey. So there seems to be afundamental mechanism for action recognition that is common to apes and humans.Here is their proposal about language development: Individuals recognize actionsmade by others because the pattern of firing neurons made when observing anaction is similar to the pattern produced to generate the action. So maybe thespeech circuits in humans developed because the precursor structure that laterevolved into Broca’s area had a mechanism for recognizing actions in others—andhad to have this ability before language could evolve.Huh? Rizzolatti and his buddies know they are walking on the wild side with thishypothesis, but let’s see where they take us, because this is what neuroscienceis all about. You find something interesting on the cellular level and try toconnect it all the way to behavior. You propose a hypothesis, and then either itgets shot full of holes or it doesn’t. As in many fields of science, theemotionally weak and the thin-skinned need not apply.We have already seen that in the vervets there is a gap between recognizingactions and sending messages with communicative intent. How did this intentdevelop in humans? Normally, when an individual is watching an action or gettingready to perform an action, the premotor areas are on alert. There is a systemof inhibition to prevent observers of an action from emitting a motor behaviorthat mimics it.47 Otherwise we’d be playing follow the leader all the time.However, sometimes if the observed action is particularly interesting, there canbe a brief lapse of inhibition and an involuntary response from the observer.This sets up a two-way street. The individual performing the action (the actor)will recognize a response in the observer, and the observer will see that hisreaction caused a reaction in the actor. If the observer can control his mirrorneuron system, then he can send a voluntary signal and thus begin a rudimentarydialogue of sorts. Voluntary control of the mirror neurons is the necessaryfoundation for the beginning of language. The ability to notice that one hasactually given a signal and the ability to recognize that it caused a reactiondid not necessarily arise at the same time. Each ability would have had greatadaptive advantage and would have been selected for.What action are they talking about? Was it facial or gestural? Remember thatboth F5 and Broca’s area have the neural structures to control both. Speculatingon the sequence of events that led to speech, Rizzolatti and Arbib guess thatthe first gestures used from individual to individual were orofacial. JaneGoodall states that long bouts of eye contact may accompany friendlyinteractions, and then describes one of many facial expressions: “There is onefacial expression which, more than any other has dramatic signal value—the fullclosed grin. When this expression suddenly appears, it is as though the wholeface has been split by a gash of white teeth set in bright pink gums. It isoften given silently, in response to an unexpected and frightening stimulus.When an individual turns to his companions with his face transfigured by thishorrifying grin, it usually evokes an instant fear response in the beholders.”59Monkeys, apes, and humans still use orofacial gestures as their main natural wayto communicate. The lip smacks and tongue smacks of monkeys persist in humans,where they form syllables in speech production. Did vocalization come next?Rizzolatti and Arbib don’t think so. Remember when we talked about monkey andape vocalization being a closed system? A manual system could have given moreinformation. In a vocal system of limited anatomy, the only way to enhance anemotional vocalization of “Scream scream scream” telling you to be scared is todo it louder: “Be more scared.” However, a manual gesture system could addinformation: “Scream scream scream” tells you to be scared and then a gesture toindicate a snake that is big and where it is. This type of behavior has beenobserved in chimps to a limited extent in the Ivory Coast: When traveling orencountering a neighboring group, the chimps combine a bark with drumming.60Once this happened, an object or event described with a gesture could beassociated with a vocalization that is not a scream but a short ooo or aah. Ifthe same sound was used each time for the same meaning, a rudimentary vocabularycould have been started. In order for this new vocalization to develop intospeech, it had to be skillfully controlled by more than just the old emotionalvocal centers. The F5-like precursor—which already had mirror neurons, a controlof orolaryngeal movements, and a link with the primary motor cortex—could havedeveloped into Broca’s area. Because an effective communication system wouldprovide a survival advantage, eventually the evolutionary pressure to form morecomplex sounds, and the anatomy that could produce them, would be selected for.Manual gestures would lose their importance (except for Italians) and become anaccessory to language, but they would still be able to function if need be, forsign language.Consider this from Luigi Barzini in his book The Italians:> > Often enough, a simple gesture, accompanied by suitable facial expressions,> > takes the place not of a few words, but of a whole and eloquent speech.> > This, for instance; imagine two gentlemen sitting at a café table.

So far we’ve found that she can plan a little, communicate alittle, but not with speech or the language skills that we use, probably doesn’tthink abstractly, and is mostly going to communicate only about her needs. Whatabout feelings? Emotions?The research into emotions, until recently, has gone through a period ofneglect. The exceptionally talented Joseph LeDoux, a former student of mine whois now at New York University, states that this happened for a couple ofreasons. Since the 1950s, it was thought that the limbic system (which involvesmany brain structures) was responsible for creating emotions, but the morerecent emergence of cognitive science has dominated research attention. Althoughhe thinks that the limbic system concept does not adequately explain specificbrain circuits of emotions, he does agree that emotions involve relativelyprimitive circuits that have been conserved throughout mammalian evolution.62Emotion research had also suffered from the problem of subjectivity, whereascognitive scientists have been able to show how the brain processes externalstimuli (pain, for instance), without having to show how the consciousperceptual experiences come about. Most cognitive processes have been found tooccur subconsciously, with only the end product reaching the conscious mind ifat all. LeDoux continues, “Contrary to popular belief, conscious feelings arenot required to produce emotional responses, which, like cognitive processes,involve unconscious processing mechanisms.” To the extent that many of thesystems that function nonconsciously in the human brain function similarly inthe brains of other animals, there is considerable overlap among species in thenonconscious aspects of the self.63One of the best-studied emotions is fear. What happens when you hear the rattleof a rattlesnake or catch a slithering movement in the grass? The sensory inputsgo to the thalamus, a type of relay station. Then the impulses are sent to theprocessing areas in the cortex and relayed to the frontal cortex. There they areintegrated with other higher mental processes and into the stream ofconsciousness; this is when a person becomes consciously aware of theinformation (there is a rattler!), has to decide to act (a rattlesnake ispoisonous, I don’t want it to bite me, I should move back), and put the actioninto gear (feet don’t fail me now!). All this takes a while. It can take asecond or two. But there is a shortcut that obviously is an advantage. It isthrough the amygdala, which sits under the thalamus and keeps track ofeverything that is streaming through. If it recognizes a pattern that wasassociated with danger in the past, it has a direct connection to the brainstem,which then activates the fight-or-flight response and rings the alarm. You jumpback before you realize why. This is more apparent when you have jumped backonly to realize that it was not a snake. This faster pathway, the oldfight-or-flight response, is present in other mammals. To what extent otheremotions will be found to inhabit mutual pathways is not yet known, but it isnow another hotbed of research.Not only does it seem that we share at least some of the same unconsciousemotions as our chimp date; observational studies in the wild are revealing thatwe may be more unconsciously apelike than we imagine. Let’s go outside.> > INTO THE TROPICAL FORESTSUntil January 7, 1974, scientists treated the remarkable violence of humanity assomething uniquely ours. Then in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, Hillali Matama,the senior field assistant from Jane Goodall’s research center in Gombe,observed for the first time a raiding party of chimps furtively entering theterritory of another chimp group and killing a lone male who was quietly eating,and the subsequent systematic killing of the rest of the males in that rivalgroup over the next three years. And the females? Two of the young femalestransferred into the raiding group, one watched her mother beaten to death byher new group, and four others disappeared. What was more shocking was thatthese groups had originally all been one community. More observations wererecorded from other areas and observers. Toshisada Nishida’s team in Tanzania’sMahale Mountains National Park (the only twenty-year chimp research programother than Goodall’s) has seen violent charges toward strangers by borderpatrols and furious clashes between male parties from neighboring communities.Since these first observations, two entire chimpanzee communities have beenexterminated by their own kind. Other observers of nonhuman primates witnessedmale gorillas and some monkey species killing infants, and male chimpanzees andorangutans raping females. As more field observations were recorded, we’velearned that although infanticide is typical behavior in many species withinevery group of animals—birds, fish, insects, rodents, and primates, practiced bymales, females, and infants, depending upon the species—killing adults is not.Richard Wrangham, professor of biological anthropology at Harvard, believes wecan trace the origins of human violence, particularly male violence, to ourorigins as apes, and more specifically to our common ancestry with the chimp. Inhis book Demonic Males, he has a convincing argument. 64 He states that the mostcompelling set of facts that point to this conclusion is involved with thesimilarities of our two societies. “Very few animals live in patrilineal,male-bonded communities wherein females routinely reduce the risks of inbreedingby moving to neighboring groups to mate. And only two animal species are knownto do so with a system of intense, male-initiated territorial aggression,including lethal raiding into neighboring communities in search of vulnerableenemies to attack and kill. Out of four thousand mammals and ten million or moreother animal species, this suite of behaviors is known only among chimpanzeesand humans.”* [Human_split_060.html#filepos1434256]Wrangham reports that observational studies have found chimps to be patriarchal.Males are dominant, inherit territory, raid and kill their neighbors, and gainthe spoils (not only increased foraging, but neighboring females), but they alsoare killed if they lose their territory. Females, however, gain a differentadvantage. They can remain in their territory and continue to forage by simplychanging allegiance to the conquering band. They remain alive to reproduceagain, whereas the male is killed. OK, so chimps are patrilineal, but what abouthumans?Wrangham reviews the ethnographic records, studies of modern-day primitivepeoples, and archaeological finds to show that humans are, and always have been,a patrilineal society, regardless of what some feminist organizations assert.(It is interesting to note that while I type this in my Microsoft Word program,the word patrilineal is underlined by the spell-check feature as having beenspelled incorrectly, and the suggested spelling is for the word matrilineal,which is never underlined as having been spelled incorrectly.) It has beenargued that this patriarchy is a cultural invention, but a new field of study,branded evolutionary feminism, views patriarchy as a part of human biology.And lethal raiding? Wrangham postulates that there is the possibility thatintergroup aggression has a common origin because it is unusual among otheranimals. Although human aggression is well known in the modern world, he alsosees patterns of violence in current primitive cultures that are similar to thechimps’ violence. One example is the Yanomami, an isolated cultural group oftwenty thousand people living in the lowland forests of the Amazon basin, whoare famous for intense warfare. They are subsistence farmers having plenty offood, and each community is made up of about ninety members. Men stay in thevillage of their birth, and the women change communities at marriage. TheYanomami do not fight over resources but most often over women. Thirty percentof Yanomami men die from violence. However, the violent raiders are rewarded.They are honored by their society and have two and a half times the number ofwives as other men and three times the number of children. “Lethal raiding amongthe Yanomamos gives the raiders genetic success.“The conditions that make Yanomami society similar to that of chimps are theirpolitical independence and the fact that they have few material goods and nogold, valuable objects, or stores of food to fight over. In this stark world,some of the more familiar patterns of human warfare disappear. There are nopitched battles, no military alliances, no strategies focused on a prize, and noseizure of stored goods. What remain are the penetrating expeditions in searchof a chance to attack, to kill a neighbor, and then to escape.”*[Human_split_061.html#filepos1434464] Thirty percent of male chimps die fromaggression in Gombe National Park, the same percentage found in the Yanomamivillages. Mortality rates from aggression in other primitive tribes are similar:in highland New Guinea, Australia, and the !Kung of the Kalahari. As Wranghamobserves, hunter-gatherer societies don’t fare any better under the microscope.A handful of societies have managed to avoid outright war for extended periods.Switzerland is the best modern example. However, to retain their peace, as JohnMcPhee writes in La Place de la Concorde Suisse, “There is scarcely a scene inSwitzerland that is not ready to erupt in fire to repel an invasive war.” TheSwiss maintain the largest army per capita in the world, enforce compulsorymilitary service, bury live mines at critical bridges and passes, and keep deepcaves carved into mountains stocked with enough medical supplies, food, water,and equipment to last the full army and some civilians a year or more. They alsoare isolated by the Alps.65So, humans and chimps are patrilineal, and both humans and chimps have a historyof lethal raiding. And it is well known that human males are more violent thanfemales. Violent crime statistics from around the world reflect that. Soagreeing on our similarities, let’s hear why Wrangham thinks this happened. Itboils down to the ecological version of economics; something calledcost-of-grouping theory, which basically states that the size of the groupdepends on its resources. In an environment where food is seasonal or erratic,the party size will vary accordingly: more food, bigger parties; less food,smaller parties. Whether a group has to travel, or how far it has to travel,depends on what they eat. Some species have a food source that is abundant andstable, so their groups end up being stable (such as gorillas, who sit aroundand eat leaves all day). However, some species have evolved to eat high-quality,difficult-to-find foods that aren’t always available, such as nuts, fruits,roots, and meat. Here we are like the chimps.Bonobos, on the other hand, are different. They eat what the chimps eat but alsothe abundant leaves that gorillas eat, without the gorillas to compete with.They don’t have to travel far to find food; they live on Easy Street. The typeof food that we and the chimps eat has made males more dominant. Traveling tofind food slows down the females, who carry and nurse the infants. The guys andthe childless females can go farther and faster and get to the patch of foodfirst, and then hang out together. They can afford to have larger parties. Theadvantage of moving around to find food with a variable party size gives aspecies flexibility and the ability to adapt to changing environments, but thedisadvantage is that when the group becomes small, it is vulnerable to attackfrom a temporarily larger group. This is what Wrangham calls a party-gangspecies: species with coalitionary bonds (the males hanging out together) andvariable party size.What makes it possible for these species to kill, just as it is possible forsome species to indulge in infanticide, is once again economic. It is cheap tokill. The cost-to-benefit ratio is good. When you kill an infant, you don’treally risk being injured yourself, so the cost is low. You gain either a foodsource or increased chance of mating with the female, because when her infant isdead, she will stop lactating and ovulate again. When you are in a gang againsta weaker neighbor, once again the risk of injury is low. What do you gain? Itweakens the neighbors, which is always good for the future, expands the foodsupply, and finds you mating once again.But why are the males so aggressive? Has sexual selection selected for maleaggression? Although they do not have large canine teeth, all apes can fightwith their fists. Adapted for swinging in trees, the shoulder joint can rotate,and an ape’s long arms and a balled-up fist can pack a punch that keepsopponents at bay. Fists can also grasp weapons. Chimps are known to throw rocksand branches. At puberty, both ape and human males develop increased upper bodymusculature and broad shoulders as the shoulder cartilage and muscle respond toincreasing testosterone levels. But even though there is a physical ability tobe aggressive, not all strong animals are.What is going on in the brain department? We can grasp the idea that animalscan’t control their emotions or urges, but aren’t humans able to control theiraggression through cool reasoning? Well, it turns out that it isn’t as simple asthat. Antonio Damasio, head of the neurology department at the University ofSouthern California, has studied a group of patients who have all had damage toa particular location of the ventromedial part of the prefrontal cortex.*[Human_split_062.html#filepos1434681] They all lack initiative, can’t make adecision, and are unemotional. One patient whom he studied closely testednormally in intellectual ability, social sensitivity, and moral sense, and coulddevise appropriate solutions and foresee consequences to hypothetical problems,but he could never make a decision. Damasio concluded that this patient andother similar ones could not decide because they were unable to connect anemotional value to an option: Pure reason was not enough to make a decision.Reason made the list of options, but emotion made the choice.66 We are going totalk about this in later chapters. What is important to know now is that eventhough we humans like to think of ourselves as being able to make non-emotionaldecisions, emotions play a part in all decisions.Wrangham concludes that if emotion is the ultimate arbitrator of an action, theemotion that underlies aggression for both chimps and man is pride. He statesthat male chimps in their prime organize their whole lives around their rank.All decisions are guided by it, including when they get up in the morning, withwhom they travel, whom they groom, and with whom they share food. All actionshave the goal of becoming the alpha male. The difficulty of reaching thisposition causes aggression. With humans it is much the same. Wrangham quotesSamuel Johnson, who observed in the eighteenth century, “No two people can behalf an hour together, but one shall acquire an evident superiority over theother.” Just as today, men flaunt their status with expensive watches, cars,houses, women, and class-conscious societies.Wrangham hypothesizes that pride “evolved during countless generations in whichmales who achieved high status were able to turn their social success into extrareproduction.”* [Human_split_063.html#filepos1435392] It is a legacy of sexualselection. Matt Ridley concludes his chapter about the nature of women in hisbook The Red Queen, “There has been no genetic change since we werehunter-gatherers, but deep in the mind of the modern man is a simple malehunter-gatherer rule: Strive to acquire power and use it to lure women who willbear heirs; strive to acquire wealth and use it to buy other men’s wives whowill bear bastards. It began with a man who shared a piece of prized fish orhoney with an attractive neighbor’s wife in exchange for a brief affair andcontinues with a pop star ushering a model into his Mercedes.”67So men and chimps are physically prepared for physical aggression andemotionally primed to achieve high status, but so are solitary orangutans, whilehumans and chimps are social. Pride accounts for social aggression also. Anygroup—whether it is a team, a religion, a sex, a business, or a country—can havea devoted following, but why? Is it the result of rational deliberation, or isit an innate response of an old ape brain?Social psychologists have shown that group loyalty and hostility emerge withpredictable ease. The process begins with groups’ categorizing into Us and Them.It is called the in-group–out-group bias and is universal and ineradicable:French-speaking Canadians versus English-speaking Canadians, police versus FBI,Broncos fans versus everyone else, Stones fans versus Beatles fans…. This is tobe expected in a species with a long history of intergroup aggression. Darwinwrote, “A tribe including many members who, from possessing in a high degree thespirit of patriotism, fidelity, obedience, courage and sympathy, were alwaysready to aid one another, and to sacrifice themselves for the common good, wouldbe victorious over most other tribes, and this would be natural selection.”*[Human_split_064.html#filepos1435601] He wrote this to show how morality couldemerge out of natural selection for solidarity. Wrangham also suggests thatmorality based on intragroup loyalty worked, in evolutionary history, because itmade groups more effectively aggressive.> > CONCLUSIONSometimes looking at the family tree isn’t always pretty, but it can explainmany seemingly mysterious behaviors. Many a couple has come to grief becausethey ignored their prospective partner’s family. In the case of our chimp date,we have a common ancestor; the families have diverged in many respects but stillshare many characteristics, as Richard Wrangham has pointed out. We have seenhow the anatomy of our body has changed significantly and been the basis forchanges that have led to many of our unique features. Bipedalism led to freehands and changed breathing patterns. Our arching and opposable thumbs have madeit possible for us to develop the finest motor coordination of any species. Ourunique larynx has allowed us to make the infinite number of sounds that we usefor speech. Our mirror neuron system is far more extensive than has been foundin other species, and we will see that it has far more ramifications than justlanguage. Other changes have been going on in our brains, changes that allow usto understand to a far greater extent than our chimp relatives that others havethoughts, beliefs, and desires. Building on these differences, we will move tothe next chapter and see where it takes us. I think a day spent with Kanzi wouldbe very interesting, but for the long term, I prefer more culture.

You know that if she is complaining, then it is serious. You arrive atthe ER with your wife and daughter, and the surgeon on duty, a total stranger,after a two-minute examination, says an emergency appendectomy is in order, now.You remember that a high-school buddy is a doctor in town, miraculously reachhim on the phone, and get the reassurance that your daughter is in good hands.Everything is a go, and the surgeon is let into your new alliance. Old alliancesare reestablished, new alliances are formed, and there is a successfulsurgery—followed by breaking of these fresh, fleeting alliances. The social mindis at work.Imagine: You have signed on to take a guided trip to a rather adventurouslocale, a place you would not attempt on your own. You are meeting with yourgroup and guide the first morning. Glancing around at unfamiliar faces, youwonder, What was I thinking? However, two days later, you are clambering up anarrow winding path, trusting a person you have known for only forty-eighthours. Later you are having an interesting lunch conversation with a nearlycomplete stranger, and that evening you are asked to join a small group fordinner. By the end of the week, the tour group you are in has divided itselfinto subgroups, which in turn have subgroups. The coalitions shift by theminute. The social mind is abuzz with ties being made and broken and, amongother things, the phenomenon of human politics is apparent.Forming and reforming social groups and alliances are what we do all the time.This is the big picture. And yet many experimental scientists like me havefocused on pieces of the big picture. We have been struggling to grasp what maywell be inherent fundamental cognitive skills that enable us to form categories,deal with quantity, or assemble piecemeal sensory input into wholly perceivedsensations. We have not focused on what the human brain does best, what it seemsbuilt to do: think socially.It is all about social process. Although we are highly skilled at categorizingpeople, animals, and things, we don’t think about triangles and squares and redand blue. I don’t look at the person walking down the street with a dog andthink, “Well the head is a circle, the torso a triangle, and whoa, lookee there,four rectangular extremities, well, I guess I should say cylindrical, and then,well, we’ve got those ten cylindrical fingers…now for the dog.” The fact is, weevolved with lots of other humans around, and developed brain capacity tomonitor social behavior in large groups so that we may assess the value ofcooperation, the risk of noncooperation, and so on. When one wakes up to thisfact, that we are a bunch of party animals, not solitary hermits or mereperceptual data evaluators, suddenly a new question presents itself. If we areso social, how did that happen? Where did that come from? Were our ancestorssocial? How can natural selection result in group cooperation? Does naturalselection work only to select for individual cognitive traits? Or does it workto select for group behavior as well?This core issue grabbed the attention of Charles Darwin. While he pushed theview of the survival of the fittest, he was well aware of the seeminglyparadoxical fact that many creatures make themselves less fit so the group maysurvive. In the worlds of bees and birds, this goes on all the time, and thesephenomena have given rise to the view that natural selection must work on wholegroups. Indeed, such mechanisms could well serve as the cornerstone for theemergence of human social and ethical behavior.That was all fine until the great evolutionary biologist George Williams put theidea of group selection to rest (for a while). In an interview, he recounted hisinsight that “natural selection works most effectively at the individual level,and adaptations that are produced are adaptive for those individuals, incompetition with other individuals of the same population, rather than for anycollective well-being.”1 Natural selection is not the mechanism at work onsocial processes and norms, which come into and out of existence so quickly.Individual selection also means that living organisms are not adapted to preventthe extinction of their own species. Organisms would be wily at preventing onlytheir own personal extinction. Williams’s “adaptationist” paradigm has dominatedthinking in evolutionary biology for the past forty years.Armed with Williams’s analysis, Richard Dawkins, the evolutionary biologist whoholds the Charles Simonyi Chair for the Public Understanding of Science atOxford University, took it further and became the vanguard for the idea of theselfish gene. On reading the idea that natural selection works only on genes,one might argue that altruism and all other ideas that favor groups wereincidental. It is easy to imagine that this sort of thinking was loathed bymany, including the well-known paleontologist and evolutionary biologist StephenJ. Gould, who referred to the core belief that natural selection works only ongenes as “Darwinian fundamentalism.”Dawkins had also built on the work done by William Hamilton in the early 1960sat the London School of Economics and the University College London, who hadestablished a Darwinian view for altruism. Hamilton worked on kin selection, andwas able to show by a simple mathematical formula (C < R × B, where C is thecost to the actor, R is the genetic relatedness between the actor and therecipient, and B is the benefit to the recipient) that our human preference foraltruism has a rationale using models of shared genes.2 This implied a limitedrestraint on selfish competitive behavior and the possibility of limitedself-sacrifices. If you were closely enough related, it would make genetic senseto help out a relative. He went on to suggest that such behavior supportedgeneral biological principles of social evolution. In short, Hamilton had givenboth Darwin and the selfish-gene thinkers a unified way of comprehending theproblem of altruism. He had worked out how fitness worked on individuals otherthan the actor. This became known as Hamilton’s principle, and it is brilliant.Still, not everyone is happy denying the role of group selection as a player inevolution. Although Dawkins, Williams, and other critics of group selectionadmit that natural selection can work on groups in principle, their stance isthat selection pressures at the individual level are always stronger than thoseat the group level. Not all evolutionary biologists agree. David Sloan Wilsonand Edward O. Wilson, in a review of the history of the rise and fall of groupselection theory, conclude that the last forty years of research have providednew empirical evidence that supports the theory of group selection and itstheoretical plausibility as an evolutionary force. “The problem is that for asocial group to function as an adaptive unit, its members must do things foreach other. Yet, these group-advantageous behaviors seldom maximize relativefitness within the social group. The solution according to Darwin is thatnatural selection takes place at more than one level of the biologicalhierarchy. Selfish individuals might out-compete altruists within groups, butinternally altruistic groups out-compete selfish groups. This is the essentiallogic of what has become known as multilevel selection theory.”3 David SloanWilson suggests that group selection is not just a significant evolutionaryforce but can sometimes be the dominating evolutionary force. In a letter toeSkeptic, he writes: “It turns out that evolution takes place not only by smallmutational change, but also by social groups and multi-species communitiesbecoming so integrated that they become higher-level organisms in their ownright.”* [Human_split_065.html#filepos1435820]Although this is a highly controversial question, we can let the evolutionarybiologists duke it out. Let us merely come away with the fact that our socialbehavior has biological origins.The deep biological forces at work in producing our social mind will becomeevident as we consider how we got to this place. Even more tantalizing is thepossibility that all those social relationships we now worry about so intenselyare merely by-products of behavior originally selected to avoid our being eatenby predators. Natural selection mandated us to be in groups in order to survive.Once there, we construct our “meaningful” as well as our “manipulative” socialrelationships, with our interpretive minds ever busy dealing with the stuffaround us, most of which involves our fellow humans. While those human socialrelationships become central to our mental life, indeed become in many cases theraison d’être of our lives, it is all generated by a process secondary to thereal reason we fall into social groups. We now think about others all the timebecause that is how we are built. Without all those others, without ouralliances and coalitions, we die. It was true, as we shall see, for earlyhumans. It is still true for us.What would you think about if you were the only person on earth? Maybe your nextmeal? However, you wouldn’t be thinking about who might help you get that mealor with whom you might share that meal. You might think about how to avoid beinga meal yourself, but there would be no one to help you watch for predators.We are social to the core. There is no way around the fact. Our big brains arethere primarily to deal with social matters, not to see, to feel, or to cogitateabout the second law of thermodynamics. We all can do these personal and morepsychological actions. We can develop rich theories about our personality, butwe do so as a result of functioning in the social world. All of that comes alongafter the fact. And the fact is, in order to survive and prosper, we had tobecome social. So, understanding how we got here requires reviewing evolutionarybiology, and to understand the biology of our current social abilities, whichinclude phenomena such as altruism, we need to remind ourselves how evolutionworks.> > EVOLUTION, NATURAL SELECTION, AND THE PUSH TOWARD SOCIAL BEHAVIORCharles Darwin and Alfred Wallace* [Human_split_066.html#filepos1436025] bothobserved that although species have a high potential for reproduction andpopulations should multiply exponentially, they don’t. Except for occasionalfluctuations, populations remain stable. After all, natural resources arelimited and remain constant in a stable environment.*[Human_split_067.html#filepos1436362] Thus more individuals are born than theresources can support, and this results in competition for those resources.Darwin and Wallace also observed that within each species, the individuals inthe population vary. No two are exactly alike, and many of the traits that arevariable are inherited. They concluded that the chances for survival weren’trandom, but varied with the heritable characteristics. According to the laws ofnatural selection, for any characteristic to be selected in a competitiveenvironment, it has to provide a survival advantage to the individual. Thatadvantage must manifest itself in a greater number of surviving offspring. Thecharacteristic may allow the individual to be more successful at finding food(so he is stronger and healthier and hence can reproduce more and longer), atmating (so he will reproduce more), or at fighting off predators (so he willlive longer and be able to reproduce more). These characteristics are coded forin the individual’s genes and are passed on to the next generation. Thus, genesthat code for any behavior that increases reproductive success will become moreprevalent in the population.Competitive pressures are affected by climate, geography, and other individualanimals, both within the species and from different species. Changes in climateand geography, such as a volcanic eruption that also affects the climate, cancause changes in food resources, making them either more or less plentiful.Social competition arises within a species, either for food resources or sexualpartners. Different species have evolved to deal with food competition indifferent ways. Some share and some don’t.One of the questions that puzzled Darwin about his theory was concerningaltruistic behavior. It didn’t make sense that an individual would share—wouldever provide anything to another individual that would decrease its ownreproductive success to the benefit of another’s. Yet this happens frequently inspecies that live in groups. As I already mentioned, William Hamilton in 1964came up with the theory of kin selection, which explains this behavior.Altruistic behavior could evolve if the benefiting individuals were geneticallyrelated to the provider. Parents will sacrifice for their children, who share 50percent of their DNA; individuals also share 50 percent of their DNA with theirsiblings; their grandchildren and their nieces and nephews share 25 percent oftheir DNA. Helping your close relatives survive and reproduce also passes yourgenes on to the next generation. It doesn’t matter how the genes get passed,just so they do.Kin selection does not explain all cases of altruism, however. Why would anyonedo a favor for a friend? This question remained unanswered until Robert Trivers,professor of anthropology at Rutgers University, figured it out. If anindividual does a favor for an unrelated individual and is sure it will bereturned at a later date, then that could provide a survival advantage.4 Thispresupposes several things, of course. One is that an individual canspecifically recognize another individual and has the ability to remember that afavor was done. Another is that the two live in close enough contact thatpredictable occasions will arise to get repaid. They also have to be able toevaluate the cost of the favor and make sure that the one they get in return isof equal value. This is called reciprocal altruism, and it is very rare in theanimal world.* [Human_split_068.html#filepos1436768]The difficulty arises because there is a time lag between when one individualperforms a favor and when the second reciprocates. The time lag could allow forcheating. If the second individual is not reliable, it is not in the interest ofthe first to cooperate with him, and the possibility of a cooperative systemfalters. Species that practice reciprocal altruism also have mechanisms toidentify cheaters,5 otherwise the behavior would never have survived. As aconsequence, strict Darwinian principles can help explain such phenomena asaltruism. During the Enron fiasco, the cry was “Follow the money.” In biology,follow the genes.This leaves one further problem: The old question, why leave a tip at arestaurant that you will never return to? We will get to this question later,and it may have to be explained by group selection!> > Sexual Selection and Social GroupsSome adaptations enhance success in reproductive competition. The classicexample is the peacock’s tail. Common sense would tell you that it could only bea hindrance towing a huge tail around. How could that possibly be adaptive?However, any bird that could survive with a big tail must surely be anattractive mate: strong and healthy and wily. That big tail is straight fromMadison Avenue, a great advertisement campaign that pays off with more mates.The birds with the big tails have more offspring.The peacock’s tail confers an advantage for sexual selection, the term for thesocial dynamics involved in mate selection and reproduction. That tail is knownas a fitness indicator. The higher the cost of a fitness indicator to theindividual, the more reliable it is. It costs the peacock a lot of energy tocarry around and maintain the big tail. He cannot counterfeit it; it is areliable fitness indicator. A guy with a new Chevy may well have counterfeitedhis fitness indicator; he could have bought it with 0 percent financing, nocredit, and a low monthly payment. However, a guy with a Lamborghini has anexpensive, high-maintenance car that cannot be purchased without good credit,and it reliably indicates his resources. A Lamborghini is a good fitnessindicator, but a Chevy is not.Trivers also helped us realize that the underlying behavior of sexual selectionall revolves around parental investment. Parental investment is “any investmentby the parent in an individual offspring that increases the offspring’s chanceof surviving at the cost of the parent’s ability to invest in other offspring.”6Hence, in any species, the sex with the higher potential rate of reproduction ismore concerned about mating as often as possible (to get as many of their genesinto the next generation as possible), and the sex with the lower reproductivepotential is more concerned about parental care, to make sure that the fewoffspring they have will survive.7 In 95 percent of mammalian species, there isa large difference between males and females as to the efforts invested inmating and parenting.8 Females have limited reproductive time, due to pregnancy(internal gestation) and care of young offspring (lactating).9 And we all knowabout males. They are ready to reproduce at a moment’s notice.The sex that has a higher parental investment and lower reproductive potential,usually the female, tends to be more fussy about mate selection.10 They havemore to lose by making a bad decision (less fit offspring that might not be ableto reproduce themselves). Female choice of mating partners has influencedphysical (the peacock’s tail), behavioral, and social evolution in males. Itintensifies both male-male competition for mating partners and female-femalecompetition. Sexual selection can lead to “runaway sexual selection.” This meansthe genes that are being selected for are also doing the selecting, setting up apositive feedback loop. Let me give you a simplified example of how this works.Say you have a population of rabbits with short ears. Along with othercharacteristics, the trait for ear length is variable and heritable. The malerabbits have little parental investment; they mate as often as they can withwhomever they can. Now, although they all have short ears, Rex’s ears are alittle longer than the others’. For some reason, a couple of the females haveevolved a preference for longer ears, so they choose to mate with Rex. Theiroffspring are not only going to have longer ears but also will have thepreference for longer ears. The traits have become genetically correlated whengenes for different traits (long ears and the preference for long ears) end upin the same bodies. A positive feedback loop has been established. The morefemales who select for long ears, the more males and females there will be whohave long ears as well as the preference for long ears. Runaway selectionoccurs.> > Big Brains, Big Appetites, and the HuntThe third factor in our drift toward being social seems to grow out of our needto nourish our ever-growing big brains. Hunting, herding, hiding, and hustlingall lead to our social instincts and ultimately our domination. One way tocompare brain sizes was used by David Geary, now professor of psychology at theUniversity of Missouri, who has estimated what is called the encephalizationquotient, or EQ,* [Human_split_069.html#filepos1437145] of various hominidspecies as a percentage of the EQ of modern humans.†[Human_split_070.html#filepos1437687] He has shown that there is a relentlessprogression of increasing relative brain size during the evolution ofhominids.11 What caused this progression?Traditional theories propose that ecological problems and problem solving havedriven changes in the brain. Harry Jerrison, paleoanthropologist and emeritusprofessor of psychiatry at the University of California at Los Angeles, notedthe brain sizes of predators and prey have increased back and forth intit-for-tat fashion over the last sixty-five million years.12 Because humans usetools for hunting (predation), it was assumed that production and use of toolswere what was driving the increase in brain size. However, this theory didn’tfit the facts.Thomas Wynn, an anthropologist at the University of Colorado, states, “Most ofthe evolution of the human brain, the presumed anatomy of intelligence, hadoccurred prior to any evidence for technological sophistication and, as aconsequence, it appears unlikely that technology itself played a central role inthe evolution of this impressive human ability.”13 That is not to say that theecology was not the early driving force for increased brain size, just that tooluse was not.Big brains are expensive and require more energy (food) than small ones, andthere is evidence that early hominids did become more efficient at hunting andforaging and were thus able to occupy a wider range of ecologies.‡[Human_split_071.html#filepos1438160] Anthropologists John Tooby and IrvenDevore argue that hunting was very important in human evolution. As StevenPinker puts it, “The key is to ask not what the mind can do for hunting, butwhat hunting can do for the mind.”14 And what it can do is supply meat, acomplete protein and a great source of energy for the greedy brain. Pinkerpoints out that in the land of mammals, those that are carnivores have biggerrelative brain sizes.Richard Wrangham, our chimp man, thinks having meat was not enough; one had tobe able to eat it efficiently. Although the diet of a chimpanzee contains aboutthirty percent monkey meat, it is very tough and it takes so long to chew thatany advantage it might have in total calories is offset by the time it takes toeat. That is, an equivalent amount of time eating plants would have supplied thesame number of calories. Wrangham not only spent many hours observing chimpbehavior, he also sampled their cuisine, and he wasn’t impressed. It was tough,fibrous, and very difficult to chew. He could not understand how any ape, eatingthe diet of a chimp—raw fruits, leaves, tubers, and monkey meat—could amassenough calories to supply the metabolically expensive big brain. Chimps spendalmost half their waking hours chewing, interspersed with short periods of rest,which allow their stomachs to empty, but not enough time to go on extendedhunts. There just wasn’t enough time in the day to eat enough calories.There also was another quandary. Chimps have big teeth and powerful jaws, as didthe early Australopithecines and Homo habilis. Homo erectus was a differentstory. His jaws and teeth were smaller, while his brain was twice as large ashis predecessor Homo habilis. What was he eating to get the calories to driveand maintain the brain expansion with those wimpy teeth and jaws? Not only that,Homo erectus had a smaller rib cage and abdomen, meaning that it could not holdas large of a digestive tract as Homo habilis. In fact modern man has a 60percent shorter digestive tract than predicted for a great ape of our size.Starting into the fire, Wrangham came up with a radical idea: those early humanswere eating barbeque!15 Cooked food has several advantages over raw food.16 Itactually has more calories, and is softer, so you don’t have to spend so muchtime and energy chewing: more calories, less time, less effort (not unlike themodern concept of fast food). In fact, the softer the food, the more caloriesthere are available for growth, because it takes less energy to consume anddigest it.17, 18 Some anthropologists have objected to this theory because theoldest evidence for fire that they have found is from 500,000 years ago, butthere are some hints surfacing that fire was on the scene much earlier, maybeeven 1.6 million years ago, just about the time that Homo erectus made hisappearance. Wrangham suggests that Homo sapiens are biologically adapted to eatcooked food.15 He thinks that cooking food drove the expansion of the brain byincreasing calories and decreasing the amount of time it takes to ingest them.This freed up more time for hunting and socializing.There are those, however, who think the story hinges on the fatty acids in thebrain. The long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) wasrequired for the expansion of the hominid cerebral cortex during the last one totwo million years. Michael Crawford and coworkers at the Institute of BrainChemistry and Human Nutrition, University of North London, think that becausebiosynthesis of DHA from its dietary precursor (alpha-linolenic acid, or LNA) isrelatively inefficient, expansion of the human brain required a plentiful sourceof preformed docosahexaenoic acid.19 The richest source of DHA is the marinefood chain, while the savanna environment offers very little of it. Tropicalfreshwater fish and shellfish have long-chain polyunsaturated lipid ratios moresimilar to that of the human brain than any other food source known. Crawfordconcludes that Homo sapiens could not have evolved on the savannas but insteadwere holed up at the beach, gathering along the shoreline.20 Nutrients gained inthis manner contributed to increasing brain size and intelligence, which allowedour ancestors to forage and fish more effectively.21But anthropologists Bryce Carlson and John Kingston at Emory University are notconvinced. They do not think the biochemistry implies any such thing. They pointout that the key premise of this perspective—that biosynthesis of DHA from LNAis not only inefficient but also insufficient for the growth and maturation ofan encephalized brain—is not well supported. To the contrary, evidence suggeststhat consumption of LNA available in a wider variety of sources within a numberof terrestrial ecosystems is sufficient for normal brain development andmaintenance in modern humans and presumably our ancestors.22By moving out into the more open landscapes—open woodlands, savannas, andgrasslands—the early hominids not only had more animals to hunt, they alsobecame more of a target for predators themselves. There is a growing consensusthat a major factor in developing larger brains was the banding together insocial groups, which made hunting and gathering more efficient and also providedprotection from other predators.23There are two ways to outfox predators. One is to be bigger than they are, andthe other is to be part of a larger group. (Gary Larsen, in a Far Side cartoon,presented a third method: All you need is a buddy who runs slower than you do.)The more individuals in the group, the more eyes are on the lookout. Predatorshave an attack range that depends on their speed and their style of killing. Aslong as you spot them and stay out of their range, you are fine. Also, if youhave compatriots who will come to your aid when you are in trouble, a predatoris less likely to attack. Herd animals are not known for the buddy system, butthe social primates are. Individuals that banded together had a higher survivalrate. And this brings us to social groups.So three intertwined factors triggered the push toward our social mind: naturalselection, sexual selection, and the consequences of needing more food tonourish our growing brains. Once social abilities became part of human brainarchitecture, other forces were unleashed, which in turn contributed to ourgrowing brain size.> > ORIGINS OF SOCIAL GROUPSIn 1966, Alison Jolly, a behavioral biologist trained in America and now at theUniversity of Winchester in the United Kingdom, concluded a paper about lemursocial behavior by stating, “Primate social life provided the evolutionarycontext of primate intelligence.”24 In 1976, Nicholas Humphrey, withoutknowledge of Jolly’s paper, also concluded, “I argue that the higherintellectual faculties of primates have evolved as an adaptation to thecomplexities of social living.”25 He was suggesting that the ability to predictand manipulate another’s behavior would give a survival advantage and would leadto increased mental complexity. Upon these and a few other papers, the theory ofMachiavellian intelligence was hatched.The hypothesis was first presented by Richard Byrne and Andrew Whiten at theUniversity of Saint Andrews, Scotland, and they suggested that the differencebetween primates and nonprimates is the complexity of their social skills:Living in complexly bonded social groups is more challenging than dealing withthe physical world, and the cognitive demands of this social life selected forincreases in brain size and function.26 “Most monkeys and apes live inlong-lasting groups, so that familiar conspecifics are major competitors foraccess to resources. This situation favours individuals that can offset thecosts of competition by using manipulative tactics, and skillful manipulationdepends on extensive social knowledge. Because competitive advantage operatesrelative to the ability of others in the population, an ‘arms race’ ofincreasing social skill results, which is eventually brought into equilibrium bythe high metabolic cost of brain tissue.”23 Poor Machiavelli. Perhaps he was theultimate sociologist, but his name has pejorative connotations, so the messengerwas shot. The theory is now called the social brain hypothesis.Another related hypothesis on increasing brain size was suggested by RichardAlexander, a professor of zoology at the University of Michigan. He focused onintergroup rather than intragroup competition and proposed that the mainpredator became other groups of hominids. This caused an arms race ofstrategizing and weapon invention: “Humans had in some unique fashion become soecologically dominant that they in effect became their own principal hostileforce of nature, explicitly in regard to evolutionary changes in the humanpsyche and social behavior.”27> > WHY IS SOCIAL GROUP SIZE LIMITED?Support for some type of social component for the big brain has come mostnotably from the very clever anthropologist Robin Dunbar at the University ofLiverpool. Each type of primate tends to have a social group size consistentwith other members of the same species. Dunbar has correlated brain size withsocial group size in primates and apes, and found there are two different butparallel scales, one for apes and one for the other primates. Both show that thebigger the neocortex, the larger the social group. However, the apes required abigger neocortex per given group size than the other primates.28 They seem tohave to work harder to maintain their social relationships.But why is social group size limited? Does it have something to do with ourcognitive abilities? Dunbar proposes five cognitive abilities that could belimiting social group size: the ability to interpret visual information torecognize others, the memory for faces, the ability to remember who has arelationship with whom, the capacity to process emotional information, and theability to manipulate information about a set of relationships. He maintainsthat it is the last cognitive skill, the one that deals with social issues, thatunderlies the limitation on group size. He points out that vision doesn’t seemto be the problem, because the neocortex has continued to grow, whereas thevisual cortex has not. Memory isn’t the problem; people can remember more facesthan their predicted cognitive group size. Emotion doesn’t seem to be theproblem; in fact there has been a reduction in the emotional centers of thebrain. According to Dunbar, it is the ability to manipulate and coordinateinformation and social relationships that is limiting social group size. One canonly handle a finite amount of manipulation and relationships!Ways to measure social skill and social complexity have been hard to find.Currently five different aspects of social behavior have been correlated withneocortex size in primates. The first to be identified was social group size.29,30 Others are:> [images/00002.jpg] Grooming clique size—the number of individuals with whom an> animal can simultaneously maintain a cohesive intimate relationship that> involves physical grooming.31> > [images/00002.jpg] The degree of social skill required in male mating> strategy.

There was no correlation between these and neocortex size.He concluded that most likely the increasing size of social groups was driven bythe ecological problem of predator risk, and the pressures and complexities ofliving in the increasingly large social groups drove brain size expansion.34 Sowe ended up with these big brains all because we didn’t want to be the plat dujour? Let’s look at these five social skills and see if any aspect of them isunique to humans.> > SOCIAL GROUP SIZE FOR HUMANSWhile the observed social group size of chimpanzees is 55, the social group sizethat Dunbar calculated from the neocortex size of humans is 150. How can thatbe, when we now live in huge cities, often with millions of people? However,think about it. Most of those people you never even have cause to interact with.Remember: Our ancestors were hunter-gatherers, and people didn’t start to settlein one place until agriculture was developed about ten thousand years ago. Todaythe typical size of hunter-gatherer clans, related groups that gather togetheronce a year for traditional ceremonies, is 150. This is also the size oftraditional horticultural societies and modern-day Christmas card lists inpersonal address books.35It turns out that 150 to 200 is the number of people who can be controlledwithout an organizational hierarchy. It is the basic number used in militaryunits where personal loyalties and man-to-man contact keep order. Dunbar statesthat it is the upper limit of the size of modern business organizations that canbe run informally.36 It is the maximum number of people an individual can keeptrack of, whom he can have a social relationship with and would be willing tohelp with a favor.> > SOCIAL GROOMING: THE ROLE OF GOSSIPGossiping has a bad reputation, but researchers who study gossip have not onlyfound it to be universal,37 they have found that it is beneficial, that it isthe way we learn to live in society. Dunbar thinks gossip is the humanequivalent of social grooming in other primates (and remember, the size of thegrooming group correlates with relative brain size). Physical grooming takes upmuch of a primate’s time. The primates that spend the most time grooming arechimps, who do it up to 20 percent of the time.38 At some point during theevolution of the hominids, as groups became larger, an individual would need togroom more and more other individuals in order to maintain relationships in thelarger group. Grooming time would cut into the time that was needed to foragefor food. This is when, Dunbar argues, language began to develop.39 If languagebegan to substitute for grooming, one could “groom,” that is to say, gossip,while doing other things, such as foraging, traveling, and eating. This could behow talking with your mouth full began.However, language can be a double-edged sword. The advantages of language arethat you can groom several people at once (more efficient) and you can get andgive information over a wider network. However, the disadvantage is that you arevulnerable to cheaters. With physical grooming, an individual investshigh-quality personal time. That cannot be faked. With language, a new dimensionhas been added: liars. One can tell stories displaced in time, so their veracityis difficult to assess, and while grooming is done among a group, where it isvisible and verifiable to all, gossiping can be done in private, and itsveracity is not challenged. But language can also help you out with thisproblem. You may be warned by a friend about a previously bad experience with acertain individual. As a social group gets larger and more dispersed, cheatersor free riders become harder to keep track of. Gossip may have evolved partly asa way to control the slackers.40, 41Various studies have found that, on the average, humans spend 80 percent oftheir waking time in the company of others. We average six to twelve hours perday in conversation, mostly one-on-one with known individuals.42 What has beenfound out shouldn’t come as any surprise to you. Nicholas Emler, a socialpsychologist at the London School of Economics, has studied the content ofconversations and learned that 80 to 90 percent are about specific named andknown individuals, which is to say, small talk. Impersonal topics, although theymay involve personal opinions on art, literature, religion, politics, and soforth, form only a small part of the total. This is true not only about chancemeetings in the grocery store but also at universities and corporate lunches.You might think that the world’s problems are being discussed and settled overpower lunches, but it is really Bob’s tee time, Bill’s new Porsche, and the newsecretary that are getting 90 percent of the air time. If you think this is anexaggerated statistic, then think about all those annoying cell phoneconversations you have overheard. Have you ever heard anyone talking aboutAristotle or quantum mechanics or Balzac at the table next to you or in thegrocery line?Other studies show that two-thirds of the content of conversations areself-disclosure. Of these, 11 percent are about states of mind (my mother-in-lawis driving me nuts) or body (I really want that liposuction). The rest are aboutpreferences (“I know it’s weird, but I really like LA”), plans (“I am going tostart exercising on Friday”), and the most talked about, doings (“I fired himyesterday”). In fact doings is the biggest category of conversations aboutothers.42 Gossip serves many purposes in society: It fosters relationshipsbetween gossip partners,43 satisfies the need to belong and be accepted by aunique group,37 elicits information,44 builds reputations (both good and bad),43maintains and reinforces social norms,45 and allows individuals to evaluatethemselves through comparison with others. It may enhance status in a group, orit may just entertain.46 Gossip allows people to express their opinions, askadvice, and express approval and disapproval.Jonathan Haidt, a psychologist at the University of Virginia who studieshappiness, writes that “Gossip is a policeman and a teacher. Without it, therewould be chaos and ignorance.”47 It is not just women who gossip, although menlike to call it “exchanging information” or “networking.” The only time when menspend less time gossiping than women do is when women are present. Then morelofty subjects are discussed for about 15 to 20 percent of the time. The onlydifference between male and female gossip is that men spend two-thirds of thetime talking about themselves (“and when I reeled that sucker in, I swear itweighed twenty-five pounds!”), whereas women spend only one-third of the timetalking about themselves, and are more interested in others (“and the last timeI saw her, I swear she had gained twenty-five pounds!”).48Beyond the content of conversations, Dunbar also discovered that conversationgroups are not infinitely large but are usually self-limiting to about fourindividuals. Think about the last party you went to. People drift in and out ofconversation groups, but once you go over four people, they do tend to break upinto two conversations. He says it may be coincidence, but he suggests acorrelation with chimp grooming. If you take a conversation group of fourpersons, only one is talking and the other three are listening, or in chimplingo, are being groomed. Chimps have to groom one-on-one, and their maximumsocial group size is 55. If we can groom three at a time, as indicated byconversation group size, then if you multiply our three grooming partners by 55,you get 165—close to our social group size that Dunbar calculated from theneocortex size of humans.> > TACTICAL DECEPTIONIn working the gossip mill, a person is involved not only in informationexchange but perhaps in manipulation and deceit. He may be deceiving his gossippartners in essence because he isn’t really talking with them to find out howthey are doing; he may be mining information for his own purposes. He might evenmake something up so as to have more gossip to barter. These are two differentissues. Let’s start with exchange. I mentioned before, in order for reciprocalexchange to work, cheaters have to be identified. Otherwise, cheaters, whobenefit without paying the cost, would eventually take over, and reciprocalexchange couldn’t sustain itself.Although there are cultural differences among groups of people, there are manyuniversal behaviors.49 As we have seen, we can trace some of these behaviorsback to our common ancestor with the chimps and beyond, and some arequalitatively different. The field of evolutionary psychology attempts toexplain mental traits, such as memory, perception, or language, asadaptations—products of natural or sexual selection. It looks at psychologicalmechanisms in the same way that biologists look at biological mechanisms.Evolutionary psychology suggests that cognition has a functional structure thathas a genetic basis, just like hearts, livers, and immune systems, and hasevolved by natural or sexual selection. Like other organs and tissues, thesepsychological adaptations are universally shared within a species, and theyenhance survival and reproduction. Some traits are not controversial, such asvision, fear, memory, and motor control. Others are controversial but arebecoming less so, such as language acquisition, incest avoidance, cheaterdetection, and sex-specific mating strategies. Evolutionary psychologistsexplain that a brain, at least in part, is made up of modules, which havedeveloped specific functional purposes that are innate and have been selectedfor. Leda Cosmides, one of the first in this field, describes the search forthese functions:> > When evolutionary psychologists refer to “the mind,” they mean the set of> > information-processing devices, embodied in the human brain, that are> > responsible for all conscious and nonconscious mental activity, and that> > generate all behavior.

She uses the Wason Test,*[Human_split_072.html#filepos1438460] which asks you to look for potentialviolations of a conditional rule: if P, then Q. Many forms of this test havebeen devised to ascertain whether or not humans have specialized cognitivemachinery for social exchange. Let’s see how you do with it:There are four cards on a table. Each card has a letter on one side and a numberon the other. Currently you can see R, Q, 4, and 9. Turn over only those cardsthat you need to in order to prove whether the following rule is true or false:If a card has an R on one side, then it has a 4 on the other. Got it? What’syour answer?The answer is R and 4. OK, now try this one:There are four people sitting at a table. One is sixteen, the second istwenty-one, the third is drinking Coke, and the fourth is drinking beer. Onlythose over twenty-one can drink beer legally. Who should the bouncer check tomake sure the law isn’t being broken? That one is easier isn’t it? The answer isthe sixteen-year-old and the beer drinker.Cosmides has found that people have a hard time with the first type of question;only 5 to 30 percent of people get this one right, whereas with the second one,65 to 80 percent of people get it right—not just at Stanford where she firsttried it, but all over the world, from the French to the Shiwiar of theEcuadorian Amazon, and not just adults, but three-year-olds as well. Wheneverthe content of a problem asks you to look for cheaters in a social exchangesituation, people find it simple to solve, whereas if it is posed as a logicproblem, it is more difficult to solve.51After many more experiments across cultures and age groups, Cosmides has foundin addition that cheater detection develops at an early age, operates regardlessof experience and familiarity, and detects cheating but not unintentionalviolations. She thinks that this cheater detection ability is a component of auniversal human nature, designed by natural selection to produce anevolutionally stable strategy for conditional helping.There is even neuroanatomical evidence. This comes from a patient, R.M., who hasfocal brain damage that has caused impairment in his cheater detection, but whohas entirely normal reasoning on similar tasks that do not involve socialexchange.52 Cosmides says, “As humans, we take for granted the fact that we canhelp each other by trading goods and services. But most animals cannot engage inthis kind of behavior—they lack the programs that make it possible. It seems tome that this human cognitive ability is one of the greatest engines ofcooperation in the animal kingdom.”50We are not the only ones who can detect cheaters in social exchanges. It hasbeen shown to exist to a limited degree in brown capuchin monkeys, inexperiments done by Sarah Brosnan and Frans de Waal.53 However, animals involvedin reciprocal exchange make approximations. Humans want to be sure they aregiving and getting the equivalent amount; approximations won’t suffice. Indeed,Marc Hauser at Harvard University thinks that our mathematical abilities evolvedwith the emergence of social exchange systems.54> > Cheating the CheatersCan you cheat the cheater detection system? Probably not, as Dan Chiappe, apsychologist at the University of Toronto, has found. He showed that in socialcontract situations, people rated cheaters more important to remember thancooperators, looked at cheaters longer, remembered their faces better, and weremore likely to remember social contract information about them.55When cheaters have been detected, there are two things that can be done withthem: Either you avoid them, or you punish them. Isn’t it easier just to avoidthem? To punish a cheater costs the punisher time and effort. What’s to begained? Recently Pat Barclay, from Cornell University, has done a laboratorystudy showing that in games with repeated encounters, players who punishcheaters gain trust and respect and are thought of as being group focused. Thebenefits of this increase in good reputation (which, you remember, is a fitnessindicator for sexual selection) can offset the costs of being a punisher, andcould be a possible explanation for how the psychological mechanisms ofaltruistic behavior evolved.56 Better not do anything that might lead to one ofyour competitors’ getting a better rep. What a stroke of luck that you saw Donwith that sophisticated-looking blonde at the racetrack. Everyone wonders whathe does on his days off. That tidbit ought to be a hot commodity in the world ofgossip exchange back at the office, but how will you know if what you get backis true? If you can detect cheaters, does that mean you’ll know if someone islying? Not really. That comes with reading facial expressions and body language.But I’m glad you brought that up because…> > Intentional DeceptionAlthough deception is known throughout the animal world, such as the pipingplover that feigns injury to lead predators away from its nests,57 intentionaldeception may be limited to the great apes.58 And humans are the masters ofdeception. It is ubiquitous and begins in the morning when women put on makeup(to make themselves more beautiful or appear younger ) and perfume (to masktheir own odor). Women have been using jewelry, hair color, and makeup for eons.One has only to cruise through the Egyptian section of the Louvre. Men are nostrangers to deception either. They put on deodorant and brush their thin hairacross their bald spots (as if that deceives anyone) or plop on their toupeesand head out to their cars that they had to buy on credit.Can you imagine a world where no one lied? It would be awful. Do you really wantto know the answer to “Hi, how are you doing today?” Or hear “I’ve noticed thatthose five pounds that you’ve put on are all on your chin”? Lies are used forself-promotion in job interviews (“Sure, I know how to do that”), and whenmeeting new people (“This is your daughter? Isn’t she the sweetest thing!”rather than Rodney Dangerfield’s comment, “Now I know why tigers eat theiryoung”).59 They’re used when meeting potential mates (“Of course I’m a naturalblonde”).60We not only lie to each other, we lie to ourselves. From 100 percent of highschool students who rank themselves as having a higher-than-average ability toget along with others (a mathematical impossibility) to 93 percent of collegeprofessors who rank themselves above average at their work, self-deception is inplay.61 Or how about “I get plenty of exercise” and “My kid would never dothat.” To be a good liar, it helps not to know that you are lying or, in thecase of psychopaths, not to care. In fact children are taught to lie by theirparents (“Tell Grandma how much you love the lederhosen” and “Don’t tell Sammyhe is fat”) and by teachers (“I don’t care if you think Joe is dumb, it is notnice to say so”).How do we tell if someone is lying? Do we really want to know? And why do we lieto ourselves?> > How Do We Tell If Someone Is Lying?While gossiping and determining if we think the information we are getting istrue, we also read facial expressions. Face perception is probably the mostdeveloped visual skill in humans and obviously plays a major role in socialinteractions. It has long been thought that face perception is mediated by aspecialized system in the human brain, and we now know that different parts ofthe brain mediate different types of face perception. The pathways that perceiveidentity are different from those that perceive movement and expressions.Beginning soon after birth, babies prefer to look at faces rather than otherobjects.62 After the age of seven months, we begin to respond appropriately tospecific expressions.63 Thereafter, face perception provides tons of informationthat greases social interaction. From the visual appearance of faces, one canaccess information about another person’s identity, background, age, gender,mood, interest level, and intentions. We can notice what they are looking at andcheck it out too, and also understand their speech better by lip-reading.64We are not alone in the ability to recognize individual faces. Chimpanzees andrhesus monkeys are also able to do so.64 Contrary to what has previously beenobserved, recent dissection has shown that chimpanzees and humans have a nearlyidentical facial anatomy65 and a full range of facial expressions. Lisa Parr atEmory University has done some studies that demonstrate the ability of chimps tomatch photographic facial expressions with emotional scenes in videos.66 So weshare with the chimps two components of gossiping and socialexchange—recognizing with whom we are dealing and being able to read emotionsfrom facial expressions—but will that help us in recognizing liars? Well, thereis a whole range of facial and body movements that are associated withdeception, which brings us back to our man Machiavelli.Paul Ekman, at the University of California, San Francisco, has done more forthe study of facial expression than anyone else. It was a lonely business whenhe started his studies, because everyone else—except Darwin, of course, and aneighteenth-century French neurologist named Duchenne de Boulogne—had avoided thetopic. Ekman, through years of research, has established that facial expressionsare universal67 and that there are specific expressions for specific emotions.When an individual is lying, the higher the stakes are, the more emotions (suchas anxiety or fear) he is feeling.68 These emotions are leaked to the face69 andvoice tone.70 And here is one of the benefits of true self-deception: If youdon’t know you are lying, your facial expressions won’t give you away.Ekman has studied people’s ability to detect liars, and it is pretty pathetic.Most people aren’t very good at it, even though they may think they are (onceagain deceiving themselves). They perform at the same rate as chance guessing.However, he has found some professionals to be good at it: Secret Service agentsare the best, and next best are some psychotherapists. Out of twelve thousandpeople whom he has tested, he found only twenty who were naturally excellent liedetectors!71 One problem inherent in reading facial expressions is that onereads the emotion but does not necessarily understand the reason for the emotionand so misinterprets it. We will learn more about this in later chapters. Youmay realize that a person is scared and think it is because he is lying to youand is frightened that you will figure that out, but it could be that he isscared because he didn’t lie and is being falsely accused and he thinks that youwon’t believe him.Of course not all deception is nefarious. Out of politeness, people will oftenact as if they are enjoying themselves when they are not, such as complimentingyou on the fish dish when in reality fish makes them gag. Or they are laughingat that really bad joke that you have already told too many times before. Theseare small-stakes lies without major repercussions.People learn to manage their expressions, but Ekman has found microexpressionsthat result from trying to conceal emotions. Most people don’t see them, but youcan learn to spot them. Fabricated expressions can also be hard to spot. Forinstance, the false smile: There are two muscles principally involved in realsmiling, the zygomaticus major, which pulls the corners of the mouth up, and theorbicularis oculi pars lateralis, which, along with pulling up the cheeks andcausing crow’s-feet, also pulls down the lateral border of the eyebrow. Theorbicularis oculi muscle is not under voluntary control, so that in a fake smilethe lateral border of the eyebrow does not depress, although a fully contractedzygomaticus can push the cheeks up to form crow’s-feet.If we are good at spotting cheaters in social exchange, why do we find it hardto spot liars? Lying has become prevalent in the population, so wouldn’tmechanisms of detection have evolved? Ekman offers several explanations. First,he suggests that in the environment in which we evolved, lying wasn’t asprevalent because there were fewer opportunities. People lived openly in groups.The lack of privacy would have made the chances of detection high, and discoverywould have been made by direct observation of behavior rather than having torely on judgments of demeanor. Second, uncovered lies would have resulted in abad reputation. Today, our environment is very different. Opportunities to lieabound, and we live behind closed doors. You can escape from a bad reputation,although it may be costly, by changing jobs, towns, countries, or spouses, andwe haven’t been prepared by evolution to detect lies from demeanor. So whyhaven’t we learned how to detect them if we don’t have the power innately?Perhaps because our parents teach us not to identify their lies, such as storiesto cover up sexual activity and who knows what all. It may be that we alsoprefer not to catch liars, because being suspicious rather than trusting makesrelationships difficult to establish and keep. Or we may want to be misledbecause we have a stake in not knowing the truth. The truth may set you free,but it may also set you free with four kids and no income. Often the reason ispoliteness: What we are told is all that the teller wants us to know, and wedon’t steal information that is not given to us.But perhaps it is language, as it has evolved recently in humans, that is theproblem. Understanding and interpreting language is a conscious process thatinvolves much cognitive energy. If we are concentrating on what is being said,rather than letting visual perceptions and vocal clues register in our consciousbrain, we may be lessening our detective powers. Gavin de Becker, in his bookThe Gift of Fear,72 advises people to trust the phenomenon that he defines as“knowing without knowing why.” He is an expert in predicting violent behavior,and he has found that most victims of violence have received warning signswithout realizing it. Has our social training taught us not to detect deception?Do we reinterpret what we actually see? There is more work to be done.> > Lying to OurselvesIsn’t lying to ourselves counterproductive? As the saying goes, if you can’ttrust yourself, then whom can you trust? Remember our cheater detector in socialexchange? It pays to be cooperative, while being vigilant for cheaters. But youreally don’t have to be cooperative. You just have to appear cooperative. Allyou need is a good rep. You don’t actually have to deserve it.You mean being a hypocrite, right? Hypocrites make my blood boil.Not so fast. Everyone (except for me, of course) is a hypocrite. It apparentlyis just easier to see from the outside than the inside. As we just learned, topull this off, it helps not to consciously know that you are pulling a fast one,because then you will have less anxiety and thus less chance of getting busted.Dan Batson at the University of Kansas has done a series of experiments73, 74with rather shocking results. Students were given the opportunity to assignthemselves and another student (actually fictitious) to different tasks. Onetask was more desirable (the chance to earn raffle tickets). The other task hadno chance to earn raffle tickets and was described as boring. The students weretold that the other participant would think the assignment was made by chance.They were also told that most participants thought that flipping a coin was thefairest way to assign the tasks, and a coin was provided for participants toflip if they wished. After the experiment, virtually all participants said thateither assigning the other participant the better task or using the coin flipwas more moral. Yet only about half flipped the coin. Of the nonflippers, 80 to90 percent assigned themselves the better task and, contrary to the laws ofprobability, the same was true among those who flipped the coin. The studentswho flipped the coin all rated themselves as being more moral than thenonflippers, even when they fiddled with the results.This outcome was replicated in numerous studies, even when the coin was labeledto avoid ambiguities in the coin toss. Some participants flipped the coin toappear fair, yet still served self-interest by ignoring the results and givingthe better task to themselves—and still rated themselves as being more moral forsimply having tossed the coin! That is called moral hypocrisy. The results wereduplicated even when the students were told that after their decision they wouldhave to tell the other participant how they arrived at it. With one discrepancy,more flipped the coin (75 percent) and reported this was how they had made thedecision; however, the percent of flippers who gave themselves the better taskremained the same. Batson states, “The benefits to oneself of moral hypocrisyare obvious: One can reap the material rewards of acting selfishly and alsogarner the social and self-rewards of being seen and seeing oneself asupstanding and moral.”Participants who had scored highly on various moral responsibility tests weremore likely to flip the coin, yet among coin flippers, the high moral scorerswere no less likely to assign themselves the better task than were those whoscored low. Thus, those with a greater sense of moral responsibility did notshow signs of greater moral integrity; they actually showed signs of greaterhypocrisy! They were more likely to appear moral (flip the coin) but no morelikely to actually be moral (allow the coin flip to determine the taskassignment).The only time participants stopped cheating with the coin flip (and they alldid) was when they made their decision while sitting in front of a mirror.Apparently, having to face the discrepancy between one’s stated moral standardto be fair versus unfairly ignoring the result of the coin flip was too much.Those who wished to appear moral had to actually be moral. Maybe we need moremirrors. That might help with the increasing obesity problem, too.OK, so we lie to ourselves and have a difficult time spotting other liars. Thisisn’t good news for your gossip exchange quest. You may need to take one of PaulEkman’s classes* [Human_split_073.html#filepos1438769] on how to spot liars, butin the meantime, at least you can watch eyebrows and know that your coworkersaren’t going to be good at spotting your lies, unless the high stakes at theoffice make you a little more anxious.> > BACK TO THE BIG BRAIN AND MALE MATING STRATEGYGeoffrey Miller, an evolutionary psychologist at the University of New Mexico,has a problem with language. No, he can talk just fine. He is concerned aboutwhy it evolved. Most speech appears to transfer useful information from thespeaker to the listener, and it costs time and energy. It seems to bealtruistic. What fitness benefit can be attained by giving another individualgood information? Reviewing the original argument of Richard Dawkins and JohnKrebs, Miller states, “Evolution cannot favor altruistic information-sharing anymore than it can favor altruistic food-sharing. Therefore, most animals’ signalsmust have evolved to manipulate the behavior of another animal for thesignaler’s own benefit.”75 And other animals have evolved to ignore them,because it didn’t pay to listen to manipulators. Those who did are notancestors.There are a few signals that are given credence: those that are reliable. Theseare the ones that say, “I’m poisonous,” “I’m faster than you,” or “Don’t eventhink about it, I’m stronger than you.” Then there are the warnings fromrelatives, like “There’s a leopard!” and the fitness indicators, like “Babe,have you seen my tail?” Miller concludes there are no credible models that canshow evolution favors signals that carry any other kind of information, as longas there are incentives for deception. And when there is competition, there arealways incentives for deception. Human language is a hotbed of deception becauseit can talk about other times and places when the listener was not present, suchas: “The trout I caught yesterday was twenty-six inches.” Or “I left you agazelle leg in that tree over the hill. Oh, gee, it’s gone? Musta been thatlion.” “It has only been driven by my grandmother to the store and back.” Andthe infamous “I was working late at the office last night.”How could reliable information-sharing have evolved? By sharing information, theteller does not necessarily lose his benefits. In fact, information-sharingcould have benefits through kin selection and reciprocal altruism. AlthoughMiller admits that this is mostly right, and probably how language initiallyemerged, when he looks at the real behavior of people, it doesn’t quite fit thepredictions of kinship and reciprocity models. If you look at language asinformation, it brings more benefit to the listener than to the talker, so weshould have evolved into great listeners and reluctant talkers. Instead ofresenting the motormouth, or the self-absorbed talker, or the speaker who droneson for an extra fifteen minutes, we should be irritated with people who sitenthralled with what we say and make no effort to tell about themselves.Everyone has something to say, and in conversations people are oftentimesthinking about what they are going to say next rather than listening to theother person. Books on procedure have been written to make rules about who maytalk when. We should have evolved huge ears and only a rudimentary speakingapparatus to gather what we could, rather than the elaborate ability to speaklanguage and the more rudimentary hearing that we have.Considering this conundrum, Miller proposes that language’s complexities evolvedfor verbal courtship. This solves the altruism problem by providing a sexualpayoff for eloquent speaking by the male and the female. “Language complexitycould have evolved through a combination of runaway sexual selection, mentalbiases in favor of well articulated thoughts, and fitness indicator effects.”75Miller does not suggest that sexual selection accounts for the big brain in itsentirety, just perhaps 10 percent.A related theory has been presented by anthropologist Robbins Burling, whowondered why, when a rudimentary form of language was all that was needed forhunting, trade, and tool making, a more complex form emerged. He suggests thatafter language’s initial emergence, its increasing complexity was the result ofmale orators competing for social status, the most eloquent gaining reproductiveadvantages. He lists evidence of this reproductive advantage from varioussocieties, ranging from the Yanomami to India and ancient Greece. Although histheory largely addresses the question of leadership, he concludes, “We need ourvery best language for winning a lover.”76Hold on a minute. Are you saying that the big brain is for flirting? Does thatmean that Frenchmen have the biggest brains?It might. Get out the saws, we’ll have to do a study.Consider what is involved in human courtship. If you are having a randomconversation with someone, that person may be mildly skeptical. However, withcourtship the stakes are high. If you are successful, it may pay off withoffspring. You have to bring out the big guns because your listener is going tobe highly critical on all fronts. She will automatically evaluate whether itmakes sense, conforms to what she knows and believes, is at all interesting ornovel, and whether she can begin to infer intelligence, education, social savvy,status, knowledge, creativity, a sense of humor, personality, and character.“How about those Sox?” is not going to do it for her. Remember how long it tookBill Murray to get the courtship right in Groundhog Day?Verbal courtship is not limited to the one-on-one encounter. Public speakingalso advertises your charms and status, as does anything that improves yourintellectual cachet. As Miller states, “Language puts minds on public display,where sexual choice could see them clearly for the first time in evolutionaryhistory.”75This is a little confusing. If guys are so good at talking, how come they havethe reputation of not communicating? And if males are selected for their verbalcourtship abilities, how come it is women who have the reputation for being bigtalkers? Well, remember that verbal courtship is a two-way street and isconsidered a fitness indicator. That means it is difficult and costly in termsof time and energy that could be spent in competition for survival resources.Once he has his mate, it doesn’t pay the male to continue with the high-costperformance. Instead of talking his head off, he may get by with just a coupleof sentences, unless sex is withheld, and then there may be a return of floweryspeech. Women, however, have an incentive to continue their verbal courtship,because they want to keep the male around to help provide for their offspring.> > SOCIAL PLAY AND BRAIN SIZE?This is a hard one to figure out. What is the point of social play? It uses alot of energy and time, to accomplish what? No one really knows the answer tothis question, but there are many ideas being batted around. It is generallythought that most youthful animal play is practice. Practice in stalking,chasing, and fleeing, a way to buff up physically,77, 78 develop motor andcognitive skills,79 hone fighting skills,80, 81 and become more physically adeptat recovering from sudden shocks, such as loss of balance and falling over, andmore emotionally adept at handling stressful situations.82 Think about a pile ofkittens. However, Elisabetta Palagi, from the University of Pisa, who hasstudied play behavior in bonobos and chimps, thinks the theories about play havefocused too much on long-term rather than immediate benefits, and this focus mayhave limited the understanding of some of the adaptive significance of play.This could be especially true about play behavior in adults. Although playbehavior is most common in young animals, in many species, like chimpanzees,bonobos, and humans, adults also play.But why do adults do it? Why do they play when they no longer need to practice?In a study of the chimpanzee colony housed in the ZooParc de Beauval inSaint-Aignan-sur-Cher, France—ten adults and nine immature chimps—she found thatnot only did the chimps groom each other the most just before chow time, but theadults and juveniles also played together the most just before chow time.83Chimps are competitive, and feeding time is stressful for them. Groomingstimulates the release of beta-endorphins.84, 85 Palagi thinks grooming and playmay limit aggression and increase tolerance, a contribution toward conflictmanagement during periods of high stress. This would be an immediate benefitrather than a long-term one, and would be beneficial to both youngsters andadults.Humans take social play to greater heights than the chimps and bonobos. One moretheory for adult play comes from Geoffrey Miller, our sexual selection expert.He suggests that the increased cost of play with age makes it a reliableindicator of youthfulness, energy, fertility, and fitness. “Well, he had his eyeon that young filly, and all of sudden he is out windsurfing and playing tennisagain. He is acting like a teenager.” In fact, Miller says that the ability toinvent and appreciate new ways of displaying physical fitness is a uniquelyhuman ability, aka sports—the intersection of mind and physical strength.75Another universal: All cultures have them. As with other animals, human malesplay in competitive sports more than females. In order to prevent competitorsfrom killing each other, and to determine who wins, sports have come up withrules, although you might not realize it when watching soccer matches. Monetaryrewards are a recent invention. In the past, the only reward was status, butthat was good enough. Winning at sports is a reliable fitness indicator, and thereward is attracting high-quality sexual partners.> > CONCLUSIONThe shift to becoming highly social is what the human is all about. Lots ofanimals have some degree of social organization but none revel in it the way wedo. As our brain became larger so too did our social group size. Somethingtriggered our interest in the other guy, in living and cooperating in groups.Richard Wrangham has a captivating theory about the role of cooking as being thefacilitator of such a huge shift in primate life. Other ideas include the needto fight off predators and to find food. Whatever the reason, others now arguethat our higher intellectual skills arose as an adaptation to our newly evolvedsocial needs. Understanding being social is fundamental to understanding thehuman condition. With the importance of social groups now well understood, it is easy to seediscussions emerge about whether or not natural selection might also work ongroups versus individuals. It is a complex argument with much to say not only onboth sides of the issue but also in the attempts to reconcile the question intotheories that cover both sides. However these matters are finally settled andagreed to by all, here we are with big brains, living in social groups andbetter for it. As we move on, realizing our social nature is deeply rooted inour biology not simply in our cognitive theories about ourselves, we begin tosee how the rest of our human equipment helps to guide us through the socialmaze."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 [Human_split_003.html#filepos3413]"},{"pageContent":"THE MORAL COMPASS WITHIN [Human_split_003.html#filepos3413]> > You have the morals of a rabbit, the character of a slug, and the brain of a> > platypus.> > > > > > > > —Cybill Shepherd, as Maddie in the TV show Moonlighting, 1985IF A MARTIAN WERE TO SHOW UP AND WATCH THE EVENING news with you, there probablywould be no limit to the number of martinis he would need to believe that wehumans are not inherently violent, amoral, and without purpose. The news droneson. It might start at the local police blotter, with the hit-and-runs, thestop-and-shop store holdups and murders, the domestic abuse, and the shenanigansdown at city hall, then proceed to the beheadings in Iraq, the retaliationbombings by the United States, the starvation in Africa, the AIDS epidemic, theplight of illegal immigrants, and on and on. “Holy smokes,” the Martian mightsay. “Your species is bad news.” Well, is it?There are roughly six billion people on earth, and those six billion people moreor less get along. Does that mean all six billion get along? If we assume only 1percent are bad eggs in one way or another, that means sixty million people aremaking trouble for the rest of us. That is a lot of mischief, and if it is 5percent, one can see there are three hundred million troublemakers in the world.Material for the evening news is everywhere, and for some reason we want to knowabout the problems, not the joys of the human condition.We are left with the amazing fact that somehow at least 95 percent of us getalong, and possess some kind of common mechanisms that guide us through thesocial morass or complexities of everyday life. I can remember the day mydaughter and I found ourselves walking down a side street in Beijing. We hadbeen guided to the wide boulevards by Tiananmen Square, and all seemed grand andproportionate. But as we took off down the side street to experience some localshopping, we were shocked by the density of people and by how we stood out inboth height and demeanor. But we were also shocked by how quickly we alladapted, how the two of us became part of the social flow and milieu in a matterof minutes. Everything from simply crossing the street to buying an item allflowed easily and naturally. I have had more unnatural exchanges on Canal Streetin New York than in Beijing.As a species, we don’t like to kill, cheat, steal, and be abusive. We go out ofour way to assist in tragedies, emergencies, and the like. Indeed, emergencyworkers, such as search-and-rescue Park Rangers, have to be trained not to beheroes, not to take undue risks to save the lives of others. Soldiers have toget pumped up and be beside themselves to kill. Booze in the military is therenot to relieve pain but to disinhibit, so horrendous acts can be carried out. Sowhy are we basically a good bunch of animals?We humans like to think of ourselves as rational beings. We like the idea thatif we are presented with a problem, we can invent a list of solutions, pros andcons, evaluate each one, and then decide which is the best choice. After all,our rationality is what separates us from “being animals.” But do we reallydecide upon a solution because it is the most rational? Why does your friend askyou, when you are presenting your list of choices, “What does your gut tellyou?”When we are presented with a moral decision, is it our rational self that comesforth and makes the decision, or is it our gut, our intuitive self, that firstcomes up with the judgment, and our rational self afterward tries to come upwith the reasons? Do we have a set of moral beliefs that we base rationaldecisions on, and if so, where does it come from? Does it come intuitively fromwithin, or consciously from outside us? Do we come off the assembly line with astandard set of moral instincts, or are they aftermarket add-ons?The world’s great philosophers have been arguing over these questions forcenturies. Plato and Kant believed conscious rationality is behind our moralactions. Hume favored an immediate emotional feeling of right or wrong. Untilrecently, all one could do was bat these ideas around without any concreteevidence, but things have changed. With our current research techniques, we cananswer many of these questions. In what follows, we are going to discover moreabout our intuitive selves and how they affect our moral decisions. We are goingto see that we actually have hardwired ethical programming that has beenselected for, and we will see what these ethical programs are concerned with. Weare going to discover how our social world shapes them and turns some intovirtues in one culture but not in another.> > DO WE HAVE HARDWIRED ETHICAL PROGRAMMING?To begin with, let me pose a moral dilemma to you, one that has been designed byresearchers to demonstrate our intuitive moral judgment. Jonathon Haidt, thevery clever psychologist at the University of Virginia whom we met in chapter 3,has come up with a provocative question he puts to his students:Julie and Mark are sister and brother. They are traveling together in France onsummer vacation from college. One night they are staying alone in a cabin nearthe beach. They decide that it would be interesting and fun if they tried makinglove. At the very least, it would be a new experience for each of them. Julie isalready taking birth-control pills, but Mark uses a condom, too, just to besafe. They both enjoy making love, but they decide not to do it with each otheragain. They keep that night as a special secret, which makes them feel evencloser to each other.1The students are asked, was it OK for them to make love? The story was designedto call upon all of one’s gut instincts and moral intuitions. Most people willsay that it was wrong and disgusting. But Haidt knew that before he started hisexperiment. He wanted to dig deeper, to get to the root reasoning, if any, weall must use. So he urges his students on: “Tell me why. What does your rationalbrain say?” Not unexpectedly, many answer that inbreeding could cause a deformedinfant or that they could be hurt emotionally. But remember, they used two formsof birth control, so that is not the problem, and we already have been told thatthey weren’t emotionally hurt but actually grew closer. Haidt tells us thateventually most students will say, “I don’t know, I can’t explain it, I justknow it’s wrong.” But if it is wrong, and you can’t explain why, is that arational judgment or an intuitive one? Have we been taught a rational rule byour parents or culture or religion that it is morally wrong to have sex withyour sibling because it may lead to birth defects, or is it hardwired knowledgethat we have a difficult time overruling with rational arguments?Where did the incest taboo come from? Incest taboos are one of those humanuniversals we talked about in the last chapter. All cultures have incest taboos.Edward Westermarck, in 1891, figured out how they develop. Because humans cannotrecognize their siblings automatically, by sight, for example, he proposed thathumans have evolved an innate mechanism whose function is to discourage incest.This mechanism operated by causing a person to be uninterested in or averse tohaving sex with those he had spent a lot of time with when a child.2 This willwork most times in preventing incest. This rule predicts that childhood friendsand stepsiblings who were brought up together, as well as full siblings, wouldall be found not to marry.Support for this idea has come from Israeli kibbutzim,3 where unrelated childrenare brought up together. They form lifelong friendships but very rarely marry.More evidence for this theory is found in the ancient custom among some peoplein Taiwan called shimpua marriage, in which the family raises the future wife oftheir son from infancy. These marriages often result in no offspring, simplybecause the partners do not find each other sexually appealing.4Debra Lieberman, an evolutionary psychologist at the University of Hawaii,expanded upon these findings.5 She was interested not only in kin recognition asit related to incest and reciprocal altruism, but also in how personal incesttaboos (“sex with my sibling is wrong”) become generalized opposition (“incestis wrong for everyone”). Did this come from parents or society, or did it comespontaneously from within? She asked her subjects to fill out a familyquestionnaire, and then asked them to rank from least morally wrong to mostmorally wrong a list of nineteen third-party acts that included sibling incest,child molestation, dope smoking, and murder. She found that there was only onevariable that significantly predicted the degree of moral wrongness a subjectranked third-party sibling incest. This was the length of time spent under thesame roof as a child and early adolescent with an opposite-sex sibling. Thelonger one lived in the same house with an opposite-sex sibling, the moremorally wrong third-party incest was considered. It was not affected byrelatedness (the sibling could have been adopted or a stepsibling); by parental,subject, or peer attitude toward sexual behavior; by sexual orientation; or byhow long the parents had been married.Why this is important to our current topic is that the moral attitude againstincest in general was not increased by learned social or parental instruction,nor was it increased by the degree of relatedness to the sibling. It wasincreased only by the amount of time that the subject had actually spent livingunder the same roof with their sibling (related or otherwise) while beingraised. This is not a rationally learned behavior and attitude that was taughtto us by our parents or friends or religious teacher. If it were rational, thenit would not apply to adopted siblings or to stepsiblings. It is a trait thathas been selected because it worked in most situations to avoid producingoffspring that were less healthy due to inbreeding and the expression ofrecessive genes. We got it at the factory.But our conscious, rational brain does not know that all this is going on. Ourconscious brain works on a “need to know” basis, and all it needs to know isthat siblings are having sex and that is bad. When you are asked, “Why is itbad?” things get interesting. Now you are activating your conscious reasoningsystem—your interpreter, which doesn’t know the above answer unless you havestudied the literature on incest avoidance recently. No problem, reasons willcome pouring out of your brain anyway!This is pertinent to research that I have done on people who have had theconnection (the corpus callosum) between the two hemispheres of their brainssevered for medical reasons. What this does is isolate the right hemisphere fromthe speech center, which usually is in the left hemisphere, so not only can’tthe right hemisphere communicate with the left hemisphere, it can’t talk toanyone else either. With special equipment, you can tell the right hemisphere todo something by giving a visual command to one eye, such as “pick up a banana.”The right hemisphere controls the motor movement on the left side of the body,so the left hand will pick up the banana. Then if you ask the person, “Why didyou pick up the banana?” the left brain’s speech center answers, but it doesn’tknow why the left hand picked up the banana, because the right hemisphere can’ttell it that it read a command to do so. The left hemisphere gets the visualinput that there is indeed a banana in the left hand. Does it say, “Gosh, Idon’t know?” Hardly! It will say, “I like bananas,” or “I was hungry,” or “Ididn’t want it to fall on the floor.” I call this the interpreter module. Theintuitive judgment comes out automatically, and when asked to explain, out popsthe interpreter to make a rational explanation, keeping everything neat andtidy.Another factor that we seem to understand intuitively is intent in socialexchange. That means if someone doesn’t reciprocate in a social exchange byaccident, it is not recognized as cheating, but if someone intentionally doesnot reciprocate, it is recognized. Three- and four-year-old children will judgean action in a story of social exchange as being “naughty” if the behavior wason purpose, but not if it was done by accident.6 Chimpanzees can judgeintention; when someone is trying to grab some food for them but can’t reach it,they don’t get upset, but they will get upset when someone can reach it butwon’t.7 Lawrence Fiddick, a lecturer in psychology at James Cook University,Townsville, Queensland, Australia, has shown that in detecting cheaters insocial exchange, individuals detect intentional cheaters at a higher rate thanaccidental cheaters, whereas in precautionary contracts (such as “if you workwith dogs, then you need a rabies vaccination”), intentional and unintentionalcheaters are detected to an equal degree.8 This ability was predicted byFiddick, using his assumption that there are two separate innate circuits in thebrain, one for social exchange, where it is beneficial not to detect accidentalcheating, and a separate one for precautionary measures, where it would be morebeneficial to detect all cheating. If all were logical in the brain, you wouldbe able to detect cheaters equally in both circumstances, independent of intent.> > IT’S NOT ALL RATIONALFurther evidence that all is not rational conscious decision making began with aVermonter who lived in the 1800s. Phineas Gage was a railroad constructionforeman who was hardworking, good at business, well mannered, civil, andrespected. One September morning in 1848 he set off to work, not knowing he wasabout to have a textbook example of a bad day and become the most famousneurological trauma survivor. That morning, rocks were to be blasted withgunpowder to clear a path for the tracks. A hole was drilled into the rock andfilled with gunpowder. A fuse was to be laid, covered with sand, and tamped downwith a long iron rod, and then the charge was to be detonated. Unfortunately,Phineas must have been distracted, because he tamped down the gunpowder beforethe sand had been added, and the gunpowder exploded, blasting the tamping ironon a trajectory through Gage’s head. It entered at the left cheek, passedthrough his eye socket, through portions of his frontal lobes and out the top ofhis skull, landing about twenty-five to thirty yards behind him.This was no pixie-stick-sized rod. It was three feet seven inches long, weighedthirteen and a half pounds, and measured one and a quarter inches in diameter atone end, tapering over a distance of about one foot to a diameter of a quarterinch at the other. It can be seen at the medical museum at Harvard. It seemsunbelievable, but Gage was unconscious for only about fifteen minutes and thenwas able to speak coherently and rationally! He was reported the next day by thelocal paper to be pain free.9 Through the ministrations of his doctor, JohnMartyn Harlow, he survived the injury and subsequent infection, and was able toreturn home to Lebanon, Vermont, after two months, though it took much longer torecover his stamina.Although this is story enough, it is not why he has become famous. Phineas Gagehad changed. His memory and reason were the same, but his personality waslight-years away from that of the affable man he had been. “He was now fitful,irreverent, and grossly profane, showing little deference for his fellows. Hewas also impatient and obstinate, yet capricious and vacillating, unable tosettle on any of the plans he devised for future action. His friends said he was‘No longer Gage.’”10 He no longer acted in a socially acceptable way. There wassome chunk of brain that had been damaged that caused this change, even thoughhis reasoning and memory were unaffected.More recently, Antonio Damasio and his colleagues have had a series of“Gage-like” patients with similar lesions (although as a result of surgery ortrauma rather than tamping rods), and they all have something in common. Theytoo are no longer themselves and have lost their ability to act in a sociallyaccepted way. The first was a patient named Elliot,11 who had a tumor removedfrom his frontal lobes. Before the surgery, he was a responsible husband,father, and employee. A few months later, his life was in shambles. He had to beprodded to get out of bed, he couldn’t manage his time at work, he couldn’t planfor the immediate or distant future, his finances were a mess, and his familyhad left him. He had seen several doctors who did not know what to make of him,because all the tests he had taken showed his brain was functioning well. Hescored above average on intelligence tests, and when presented with problems, hecould come up with well-thought-out lists of possible solutions. His sensory andmotor skills were unchanged, as were conventional memory, speech, and language.However, Damasio noticed that he showed a flattened affect, that is, hisemotions, both primary and social, were severely impaired.Elliot could no longer function in a socially accepted way. He had a difficulttime making appropriate decisions, and Damasio hypothesized that the reason wasthat he no longer had emotions. He proposed that before we make a decision, whenan option presents itself, an emotional response is evoked. If it is a negativeemotion, the option is eliminated from consideration before rational analysisbegins. Damasio proposed that emotions play a major role in decision making, andthat the fully rational brain is not a complete brain. These findings havecontributed to a grand reevaluation of the contributions of emotions to thedecision-making process. It turns out that no matter how many rational ideas aperson is able to come up with, emotion is necessary to make the decision, andthat includes deciding on moral dilemmas.> > MAKING DECISIONSPeople make decisions all day long. Should I get up now or doze a while longer?What should I wear today? What should I have for breakfast? Should I exercisenow or later? So many decisions, you don’t even realize you are making them. Asyou drive to work you are deciding when to put your foot on the accelerator, thebrake, and perhaps the clutch. You are also adjusting your speed and your routeto get to work on time, turning the radio dial, and perhaps talking on your cellphone. The interesting and scary thing is that your brain can think consciouslyabout only one thing at a time. All those other decisions are being madeautomatically.There are two types of automatic processes. Driving is an example of intentional(you have the intention of driving to work) and goal-directed (get to work ontime) processes that have been learned over time until they become automatic; sois playing the piano or riding a bicycle. The second type is preconsciousprocessing of perceptual events: You perceive a stimulus by seeing, hearing,smelling, or touching, and your brain processes it before your conscious mind isaware that you have perceived it. This takes place effortlessly and withoutintention or awareness. It turns out that what this automatic processing isdoing is placing all your perceptions on a negative (the room is white, I don’tlike white) to positive (the room is brightly colored, I like bright colors)scale and biasing your decisions one way (something about this place isn’tcalling to me…let’s keep looking) or the other (I bet this place is good, let’seat here). Your automatic processing is helping you to answer the evolutionarilysignificant question, “Should I approach or avoid?” This is called affectivepriming, and it affects your behavior. If I asked why you don’t want to eat atthe first place, you will give a reason, but it most likely won’t be “I get anegative flash in a white room.” It would more likely be “Oh, it just didn’tlook all that exciting.”John Bargh at New York University has placed volunteers in front of a computerscreen and told them that he would flash words on the screen. They were to tap akey with their right hand if they thought it was a bad word (such as vomit ortyrant) or tap a key with their left hand if it was a good word (such as gardenor love). What they didn’t know was that he was also flashing words on thescreen for a hundredth of a second (too fast for them to consciously realize)before he would flash the word they were to judge. What happened was, if heflashed a negative word on the screen first, followed by a negative word thevolunteer was aware of, the volunteer responded faster than if he had not beenprimed. If a good word was flashed after the negative word, he would take longerto tap the key, because more time was required to adjust from the subliminalnegative impression.12 Bargh has later shown that if he exposed subjects towords describing rude behavior and then instructed the subjects to tell someonein another room when they were done, they were more likely to interrupt thatperson to tell them (66 percent of participants) than if they had had noaffective priming (38 percent), and they were less likely to interrupt if theyhad been primed with polite words (16 percent).13Error management theory predicts that one should be biased toward committingerrors that are less costly.14 In thinking about evolution, one would postulatethat those who survived were those who reacted more quickly, that is,automatically, to a negative cue, and a negativity bias should have beenselected for. After all, it is more important to detect something that willhurt, kill, or make you sick than it is to react to seeing a bush with berrieson it. There will always be another bush, but not if you are killed by thatlion. Well, we do have a negativity bias! Big time. Subjects will pick angryfaces out of a neutral crowd faster than happy faces.15 One cockroach or wormwill spoil a good plate of food, but a delicious meal sitting on top of a pileof worms will not make the worms edible. And extremely immoral acts have analmost indelible negative effect: Psychology undergraduate students were askedhow many lives a person would have to save, each on individual occasions andeach at risk to his or her own life, to be forgiven for the murder of one. Theirmedian response was twenty-five.16This negativity bias has been documented and reviewed by Paul Rozin and EdwardRoyzman at the University of Pennsylvania, who tell us that it appears to beubiquitous in our lives. Negative stimuli raise blood pressure, cardiac output,and heart rate.17 They grab our attention (newspapers thrive on bad news). Weare better able to read negative than positive emotions in other people. Thenegativity bias affects our moods, our way of forming impressions of people, oursearch for the perfect (one tiny smudge in a rare book will bring down itsvalue), and our moral judgments. We even have a greater number of negativeemotions, and we have more words for pain than for good sensations.16Rozin and Royzman have suggested that the adaptive value of the negativity biashas four components: 1. Negative events are potent. You can be killed! 2. Negative events are complex. Should you run, fight, freeze, or hide? 3. Negative events can happen suddenly. There’s a snake! There’s a lion! And they need to be dealt with quickly—a good reason that faster automatic processing would have been selected for. 4. Negative events can be contagious—spoiled food, dead bodies, sick people.Earlier, when we discussed emotions, we learned that incoming information passesfirst through the thalamus, then to the sensory processing areas, and then tothe frontal cortex. However, there was a shortcut through the amygdala, whichresponds to patterns that were associated with danger in the past. The amygdalanot only affects your motor system but also can change your thinking. Your quickemotional response of fear or disgust or anger to the threatening (negative)incoming information will color how you process further information. Itconcentrates your attention on the negative stimulus. You aren’t thinking themozzarella looks fresh, the basil is fragrant, the tomatoes are red and juicy;you are thinking, Yuck, there is a greasy hair on my plate, and I am not goingto eat this. In fact, I’m never eating here again. This is our negativity bias.There are some things that affect us in a positive manner, although there is noequivalent to the emergency status given to negative stimuli. One of theseeffects is with unconscious mimicry. Bargh and Tanya Chartrand have found thatpeople who were assigned to do a task with a stranger were more likely to likethe stranger, and find their interactions to be smoother, when the strangercopied their mannerisms. They also tended to mimic the mannerisms of thestranger without later being aware they had.18 The researchers hypothesize thatautomatic mimicry increases liking and serves the purpose of facilitating socialinteractions. When you first meet someone, you get an impression, and thesefirst impressions are usually almost identical to ones formed with longercontact and observation.19 In fact, different observers will have a remarkablysimilar rating of a stranger’s personality, and that rating is in remarkableagreement with the stranger’s self-rating of those personality traits.20Mimicry is what makes a newborn baby copy his mother’s expressions, sticking outhis tongue when she does and smiling when she does. A related positive effect isthat people tend to agree with others whom they like21 (your friend tells youher neighbor is a jerk, so you will tend to agree), unless agreement leads toconflicts with what the person already knows (you know her neighbor personallyand think she is nice). Even your physical position will unconsciously affectyour bias. People like novel stimuli better if their arms are flexed (accepting)than if they are extended (pushing away).22 In one study, half the subjectspulled a lever toward them if a word was positive, or pushed it away if it wasnegative, and the other half did the opposite. The subjects reacted faster topositive words if they were pulling the lever. Experimenters tried it again withjust pushing for all words, or pulling for all words, and the reaction time wasfaster if the pushers saw a negative word than if they saw a positive word, andit was opposite for the pullers; their reaction was faster for the positivewords.23 All decisions we make are based on whether to approach or withdraw,including our moral decisions. If it is good, we approach; if it is bad, wewithdraw; and these decisions are affected by the bias mechanisms, which in turncan elicit emotions that come as standard equipment from the baby factory.> > THE NEUROBIOLOGY OF MORAL JUDGMENTSNow try this scenario, known as the trolley dilemma:> A runaway trolley is headed for five people, who will be killed if it proceeds> on its present course. The only way to save them is to hit a switch that will> turn the trolley onto an alternate set of tracks where it will kill one person> instead of five. Should you turn the trolley in order to save five people at> the expense of one?If you are like most people, you will say yes, it is better to save five thanone.Now try this one:> As before, a trolley threatens to kill five people. You are standing next to a> large stranger on a footbridge crossing above the tracks, between the oncoming> trolley and five workmen on the tracks below. Pushing the large stranger off> the bridge and onto the tracks below will stop the trolley. He will die if you> do this, but the five workmen will not be killed. Should you save the five> others by pushing this stranger to his death?24Most people will answer no to this one. Why this dichotomy, when the actualnumbers are no different in the two dilemmas? What is your interpreter sayingnow?Joshua Greene, a philosopher-turned-neuroscientist at Harvard, thinks it isbecause the first scenario is more impersonal. You push a button and have nophysical contact. The second one is personal. You actually have to physicallypush the stranger off. Greene looks to our evolutionary environment to solvethis problem. Our ancestors lived in an environment of small social groups whosemembers were known to each other and whose dealings were regulated by emotionsand were all on a personal level. It would then make sense that we should haveevolved a hardwired emotional response to personal moral dilemmas, a responseselected for survival or reproductive success. Indeed, when he used fMRI to lookat areas in the brain that were being used in the above dilemmas, Greene foundthat with the personal dilemma, the brain areas associated with emotion andsocial cognition had increased activity. Dilemmas that were impersonal were nota part of the ancient environment, so when faced with the impersonal dilemma,the brain has no default reaction and has to resort to actual consciousthinking. With impersonal dilemmas, areas associated with abstract reasoning andproblem solving showed increased activity.25Marc Hauser, however, thinks there are too many other variables in thesedilemmas to narrow it down to personal versus impersonal. The results can alsobe explained in terms of a philosophical principle that it is permissible tocause harm as a by-product of achieving a greater good, but not to use harm toachieve it26—which is to say, the means don’t justify the ends. This is thendiscussing action based on intent. The intent in the first is to save as many aspossible; the intent of the second is not to harm the innocent bystander.Perhaps we can say it like this: Flipping the switch is emotionally neutral,neither good nor bad. So we get no help from intuitive bias or emotion; we thenthink about the problem rationally: One dying and saving five is better thanfive dying and saving one. In the second dilemma however, pushing an innocentperson off a bridge is not emotionally neutral. It feels bad: Don’t do it.Indeed, if you were the large person, the idea of jumping off the bridgeyourself most likely would never even enter your head. Very bad. Jana Borg andcolleagues, at Dartmouth College, decided to explore further. They found thatthe posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) is used for the harder personalscenarios, and for the easy ones, the anterior STS. They postulate that theposterior STS may be used in thought-provoking, first-time scenarios, and theanterior portion may be more involved in previously resolved, more routinedecisions.27> > ACTION VERSUS NO ACTIONWe began by observing that we can make a moral judgment quickly, automatically.Even though we may not be able to explain it logically, we will keep on trying.In incest avoidance, we saw an example of hardwired behavior that we considermoral. In the trolley dilemma, we have seen that moral judgments are notcompletely rational. They depend on the circumstances (automatic bias, personalor impersonal situations). They depend on whether action or no action isrequired. They also depend on intent and emotions (Damasio’s patient Elliot). Wehave found that some automatic pathways are learned over time (driving), andsome are inherent (approach-avoidance with a negativity bias). The latter can beaffected by emotions, which also have been hardwired to varying degrees. Now weneed to know a bit more about how the brain works.It was thought in the past—and some still think so today, although their numbersare dwindling—that the brain is a general-purpose organ that can work on anyproblem with equal ability. If this were true, though, we should pick upmolecular biology as easily as we learn to talk, and we definitely should not beable to figure out the great evolutionary psychologist Leda Cosmides’social-exchange questions better than we do logic questions. It appears ourbrains have neuronal circuits that have developed over evolutionary time that doindeed do specific jobs.The concept of a brain with specialized circuits for specific problems is calledthe modular brain theory. I first wrote about this years ago in The SocialBrain. It seemed logical, considering how most neuropsychological knowledge atthe time emphasized how focal brain lesions produced discrete and specificdeficits in patients. If a specific part of the brain is damaged, there arespecific disorders of language, thought, perception, attention, and so on. Andnowhere were such phenomena more dramatic than in split-brain patients, provingthat the left side of the brain is specialized for one set of capacities and theright side for another kind.More recently, the idea of modularity has been augmented by evolutionarypsychologists. Cosmides and Tooby, for example, define modules as “units ofmental processing that evolved in response to selection pressures.” Yet, fromconsidering the neurologic literature, it is clear that modules are not likeisolated cubes stacked up neatly in the brain. Modern brain imaging studies haveshown that the circuits for these modules can be widely scattered. And modulesare defined by what they do with information, not by the information theyreceive (the input or stimulus that triggers them). Clearly, over evolutionarytime, these modules evolved to react in specific ways to specific stimuli in theenvironment.But our world has changed too fast for evolution to keep up with it. More typesof information are going in, but the modules are still triggered in the same oldways. Although the range of stimuli is broader, their automatic responses stilloccur.Furthermore, the brain is constrained. There are things it just cannot do,cannot learn, and cannot comprehend. For the same reason, a dog cannotcomprehend that, or why, you care so much about the Gucci shoes he just chewedup—after all, leather is leather—but he is getting the general feeling thatmaybe it was a bad move. There are some things the brain learns in just one try,and there are some things that take many attempts. The idea that the brain can’tdo everything is a hard concept, since it is difficult to conceive of things ourbrain can’t grasp. Like, please explain the fourth dimension again, and thatthing about time not being linear. The brain is basically lazy. It will do theleast amount of work it can. Because using intuitive modules is easy and fastand requires the least amount of work, that is the default mode of the brain.What is being proposed now by many researchers studying morals and ethics1 isthat we have modules that have evolved to deal with specific circumstancescommon to our hunter-gatherer ancestors. They lived in a social world made up ofgroups mostly of related people. Occasionally they met up with other bands ofpeople, some more closely related than others, but they all needed to deal withthe problems of survival, which included eating and not being eaten. Since thiswas a social world, the specific circumstances they often had to deal withinvolved other individuals, and some of these circumstances involved what weconsider to be moral or ethical issues. These modules produce specific intuitiveconcepts that have allowed us to create the societies we live in.> > ETHICAL MODULES: WHAT ARE THEY? WHERE DO THEY COME FROM?The proposal is that a stimulus induces an automatic process of approval(approach) or disapproval (avoid), which may lead to a full-on emotional state.The emotional state produces a moral intuition that may motivate an individualto action. Reasoning about the judgment or action comes afterward, as the brainseeks a rational explanation for an automatic reaction it has no clue about.This includes moral judgments, which are not often the result of actual moralreasoning. Occasionally, however, the rational self does truly participate inthe judgment process.Marc Hauser points out that there are three possible scenarios for intuitiveprocesses. At one end of the spectrum of opinion are those who believe there arespecific inborn moral rules: It is wrong to kill, steal, or cheat; it is good tohelp, be fair, and keep promises. On the opposite end of the argument, somemaintain that we are born with no intuitions, just the proverbial blank slate,an ability to learn moral rules. Thus you could just as easily learn thatcheating and incest are good and fairness is wrong. Then there is the middleposition, which Hauser favors, believing we are born with some abstract moralrules and a preparedness to acquire others, just as we are born with apreparedness to acquire language. Thus our environment, our family, and ourculture constrain and guide us to a particular moral system, as they do to aparticular language.From what we have seen so far, the middle path seems the most likely. To findwhere these abstract moral rules come from, Hauser looks at common behaviors weshare with other social species, such as being territorial; having dominancestrategies to protect territory; forming coalitions to garner food, space, andsex; and reciprocity. Social reciprocity, having been taken by humans to heightsunheard of in the animal world, provides a treasure trove in the search forabstract moral rules. The specific circumstances needed for social reciprocityto exist, as shown by researchers in game theory, require not only that thecheaters be detected but also that they be punished. Otherwise, cheaters, whoinvest less but receive an equal benefit, will outcompete the noncheaters andtake over. If cheaters take over, reciprocity crumbles. Humans have evolved twoabilities that are necessary for prolonged reciprocal social exchange: theability to inhibit actions over time (that is, delayed gratification) andpunishment of cheaters in reciprocal exchange. These currently are on the shortlist of uniquely human capacities.28Haidt and his colleague, Craig Joseph at Northwestern University, have come upwith a list of universal moral modules* [Human_split_074.html#filepos1438967]after comparing research on human universals, cultural differences in morality,and the precursors of morality in chimpanzees. Their findings also derive fromthe similar set of common behaviors that Hauser uses, but they add one class ofabstract intuitions that are derived from the uniquely human emotion of disgust.Their five modules are reciprocity, suffering, hierarchy, boundaries betweenin-groups and out-groups (coalitions), and purity.29, 30 Not everyone will agreeon these, but as Haidt and Joseph point out, they cover the wide range of moralvirtues, which they define as characteristics of a person who is consideredmorally praiseworthy. Their list encompasses moral concerns in the world’scultures, not just Western cultures.All such lists provide us with avenues of study. They aren’t by any meansdefinitive. Virtues are not universal. They are what a specific society orculture values as morally good behavior that can be learned. Various culturesemphasize various aspects of the above five modules, and this is what drivescultural differences in morality. This is the part of Hauser’s middle path thatis influenced by society. Richard Shweder, an anthropologist at the Universityof Chicago, proposes three areas of moral concern: the ethic of autonomy, whichis concerned with an individual’s rights, freedoms, and welfare; the ethic ofcommunity, which is concerned with protecting families, communities, andnations; and the ethic of divinity, which is concerned about the spiritual selfand physical and mental purity.31 Haidt and Joseph favor a similar schema: Theyplace the concern for suffering and reciprocity under the ethic of autonomy, theconcern for hierarchy and coalitional boundaries under the ethic of community,and the concern for purity under the ethic of divinity.I will address these separate modules, the input that activates them (theenvironmental trigger), the moral emotions that they elicit, and the moralintuition (the output) that results. As Damasio surmised, emotions are thecatalyst, and they help us to explain why all is not rational in the world.Although on the surface it may seem that a fully rational world would be abetter one, however, on just a quick look, we can nix that idea. For instance,the classical question in economics is why ever leave a tip in a restaurant thatyou will never go back to? That is not rational. Why not dump your sick husbandor wife and get a healthy one? That would be more rational. Why spend publicmoney on the severely handicapped, when they will rarely be able to repay it?Haidt also makes the point that moral emotions aren’t just for being nice.“There is more to morality than altruism and niceness. Emotions that motivatehelping behavior are easy to label as moral emotions, but emotions that lead toostracism, shaming, and murderous vengeance are no less a part of our moralnature. The human social world is a miraculous and tenuous co-construction ofits participants, and any emotion that leads people to care about that world,and to support, enforce, or improve its integrity should be considered a moralemotion, even when the actions taken are not ‘nice.’”32Oddly enough, Robert Frank, an economist, stepped into the world of thepsychologists, philosophers, and the selfish gene. He suggests that moralsentiments are consistent with the selfish-gene theory. It can be to a selfishperson’s advantage to have moral sentiments that are visibly expressed by moralemotions, which predispose him not to cheat. Moral emotions, which are difficultto counterfeit, advertise that you have a conscience and would sufferuncomfortable feelings of guilt if a promise were broken. For instance, you knowyou can trust what the infallible blusher tells you. She cannot tell a liewithout turning beet red. Humans are the only animal that blushes. Anothervisible sign of an emotion are tears. Humans are the only animal that cries.Although other animals have tear ducts, they produce tears only to keep the eyehealthy. They do not produce tears with emotions.Moral sentiments and emotions can be a commitment device that allows potentialpartners in trade or social exchange to get past the first round of exchangewithout cutting and running.33 In short, they solve the commitment problem inpersonal relationships and in social exchange, which is: Why would anyone evergo into partnership with someone else in the first place? A rational personwould never go into partnership with someone else because of the highprobability that the other rational person would cheat, because if theopportunity presented itself, there would be no rational reason not to. Howcould you ever convince another rational person that you wouldn’t cheat? Itdoesn’t make sense not to.Why would any rational person get married when they read the divorce rate orwhen they can have sex with innumerable others without the expense? Why wouldyou ever start a business with someone? Why would you ever lend anyone money?Emotions solve the problem. Love and trust can lead to marriage, trust topartnerships. The fear of feeling guilt or shame prevents you from cheating, andyou know (because of your theory of mind) that your partner would also feel thesame way. Anger and rage against a cheater is a deterrent. Possessing a theoryof mind allows one to plan one’s actions, taking into account how they willaffect the beliefs and desires of another. If you cheat someone, they will getangry and retaliate. You don’t want to feel the embarrassment when the otherperson finds out, nor do you want the retaliation, so you don’t cheat.One type of moral emotion, however, is not limited to a single module, as wewill soon see. Here is an overview of the five moral modules most commonlypostulated.> > The Moral Modules> > THE RECIPROCITY MODULESocial exchange is the glue that holds societies together, and it is emotionsthat hold social exchange together. It is probable that many of the moralemotions arose in the context of reciprocal altruism and have precursors thatcan be seen in infants and other animals. If you recall, in order for socialexchange to work, social contracts have to be made and honored. These take theform, If I do this for you, then you will do an equal amount for me sometime inthe future. Robert Trivers, who helped us out in the previous chapter byexplaining kin altruism, believes when looking at reciprocal altruism thatemotions are what mediates between our intuitions and behavior. We will engagein reciprocity with those we trust, and we trust those who reciprocate.Individuals who didn’t like being cheated and did something about it, andindividuals who felt guilty if they cheated and didn’t like that feeling, werethe ones who were necessary to allow reciprocity to exist—by creating a societyin which the honest would not be outcompeted by cheaters. Although there isevidence that reciprocity exists in a few other animals such as vampire bats andguppies, it exists only on a one-to-one basis. Humans will gossip and tellothers who is a violator and who is trustworthy.The moral emotions connected with reciprocity are sympathy, contempt, anger,guilt, shame, and gratitude. Sympathy can start the ball rolling by motivatingan exchange. “Sure, I’ll help you out.” Anger urges you to punish cheaters; itis a reaction to unfairness and can motivate revenge. Contempt is looking downon people who haven’t pulled their weight or measured up to theirself-proclaimed ideals, and feeling morally superior to them. Contempt for aperson weakens other emotions, such as compassion, making future exchanges lesslikely. Gratitude results from the exchange but is also felt toward those whodetect cheaters. The automatic processing of the reciprocity module is saying,Pays his debts, cooperates, and punishes cheaters: good, approach, or Cheats:bad, avoid. The virtues that have been derived from intuitive reciprocity are asense of fairness, justice, trustworthiness, and patience. However, reciprocityis not built on an innate sense of fairness; it is built on an innate sense ofreciprocity.Two university professors sent Christmas cards to a list of people they didn’tknow. Surprisingly, they received return cards from most of those people, andmost didn’t even ask who they were.34 Charity organizations have found that theycan double their donations when they give a litte something along with theirrequest for money, such as return-address stickers. Reciprocity is a stronginstinct, but although fairness is a virtue that derives from it, it is not themaster. Vernon L. Smith, a Nobel Prize winner in economics and currentlyprofessor of economics and law at George Mason University, has demonstratedthis.35, 36, 37 There is a research game called the ultimatum bargaining game.You give Dave a hundred dollars and tell him to share it with Al. Dave has tosay beforehand how much he is going to give Al. If Al refuses the offer, neithergets anything. The rational offer would be to offer Al one dollar. Al shouldaccept it because he comes out ahead. But people who are offered a low amount inthese games do not accept the offer. It makes them mad and the punishment theydole out is to refuse it. Both sides lose.Most people who play the ultimatum game offer fifty dollars. This would make youthink that fairness is what is going on. However, in a group of collegestudents, if you vary the game a bit so Dave has to earn his position by scoringin the top half of the class on a general knowledge test, and Al has to acceptwhatever he is offered (this is now known as the dictator game), behaviorschange. Daves are less generous. They no longer offer half, as they had in theultimatum game. If Dave thinks his identity is not known to Al, he is again lessgenerous. If Daves think the experimenter doesn’t know their identity, 70percent of them don’t offer any money to Al in the dictator game. The resultsled Smith to conclude that it is as if the Daves don’t think they’ll be askedback if they are known not to play in a socially acceptable manner. Fairness isobviously not the motivation in these games, whereas opportunity is. Smithargues that the reason Daves act fairly in the original ultimatum game is thatthey are obsessed with reciprocity and want to maintain their personalreputation, but when their identity is not known or they have a higher status,fairness is not the issue.Smith tweaked his game again by having Dave and Al play a series of games, notjust one. Dave and Al can pass or take the cash on each turn, and the amountgrows with each pass. Eventually, the game ends if neither has opted to take thecash by a certain point, and Dave gets the cash. If all were rational, Al shouldfigure that he should take the cash on his last turn, and Dave should figurethat Al will do that, so Dave should take it on his second-to-last turn, and soon and so on, so that the rational person should take the cash on his firstopportunity. But the students don’t. They let Dave take it on the last round,and hope for reciprocal generosity on the next round. This is Robert Frank’scommitment model. Both parties know each other and are playing a series ofgames.These studies have been extended to the world beyond college students. The gameswere played with fifteen small-scale societies on four continents and in NewGuinea. Although the results were more widely varied (lowball offers were morereadily accepted in some societies and not in others), the researchers concludedthat in none of the societies did people play with a completely selfishbehavior. How they played varied with how important local cooperation was andhow dependent they were on marketing and trading goods. The individual player’spersonal economic status or demographic had no effect, and the play patternspretty much resembled their everyday interactions.38 The more the societyengaged in reciprocal trade beyond their kinship ties, the more equitable theoffers were.> > THE SUFFERING MODULEA concern for suffering, or a sensitivity to or a dislike of signs of physicalpain in others, and a dislike for those who cause the pain, is a good adaptationfor a mother raising an infant who has a long period of dependency. Anyadaptation that increases the offspring’s chance of survival would have beenselected for, and an ability to detect suffering in one’s offspring fits thiscriterion. Sympathy, compassion, and empathy most likely have their distantorigins in mimicry, which result in mother-offspring bonding and attachment,which in turn tend to increase survival of offspring. The virtues Haidtconcludes societies derive from this intuitive ethic are compassion andkindness, but we could add righteous anger.> > THE HIERARCHY MODULEHierarchy has to do with navigating in a social world where status matters. Weevolved in social groups that were rife with dominance and status, both socialand sexual. Our cousins the chimps are forever concerned about rank anddominance, and so are humans. Even in egalitarian societies, hierarchy exists insocial status, work organizations, and sexual competition. No matter howegalitarian the society, some individuals will be more fit, more attractive, andthus ranked higher by the opposite sex. And somebody has to run the committeemeetings, or chaos ensues. Intuitive behaviors that led to maneuvering thissocial web by being respectful to dominants or wielding power with aplomb wouldhave been successful. We saw how the emotions of guilt and shame worked insocial exchange, but they can also nudge one to act in a socially acceptableway, helping one navigate the hierarchical social world. Guilt is the beliefthat one has caused harm or suffering and can motivate helpful behavior,especially if one is caught in a reprehensible act, whereupon guilt becomesshame. Shame is violating a social norm knowing that someone is watching. Itmotivates one to hide or withdraw, which indicates that one understands theviolation and is less likely to be attacked for committing it. Guilt and shamecan be motivators for all the moral modules. Embarrassment is often felt aroundpeople of higher status. It motivates one to present oneself properly and showrespect for those in authority, thus avoiding conflict with more powerfulindividuals, increasing the odds of survival. We learned in the last chapterthat the reward for those who punished cheaters was increased status. Otheremotions that are associated with hierarchy are respect and awe, or resentment.Virtues based in hierarchy are respect, loyalty, and obedience.> > THE IN-GROUP/OUT-GROUP COALITION MODULECoalitions are prevalent in chimpanzee society and among other social mammals,such as dolphins. They are endemic among humans, who organize themselvesspontaneously into mutually exclusive groups. There are the sugar people and thesalt people, farmers and herders, dog lovers and cat lovers. It is almost comic(if it didn’t lead to so much tragedy) to look at an atlas of the world and seehow many countries do not like their neighbors. Robert Kurzban, John Tooby, andLeda Cosmides have found evidence for a specialized module that codes forcoalition recognition.39 In an evolutionary world where kin groups livetogether, where hostile neighboring bands can be encountered, and where shiftingpower struggles erupt in social groups, it would be beneficial to be able torecognize patterns of cooperation, competition, and political allegiance.Visible markers that suggested who was allied with whom would be important.Arbitrary cues, such as skin color, accent, or manner of dress, would becomesignificant only if they had predictive validity for coalitional membership.Otherwise they would be unimportant. The hunter-gatherer societies in which weevolved would rarely, if ever, have come into contact with groups of anotherrace. They rarely moved more than a short distance. But race could be used as acoalition marker in the right circumstances because it is highly visible. Insociological tests in the past, people always categorized other people accordingto race, no matter what social context they presented.To test if there might be a module that specialized in coalition recognitionrather than race recognition, which did not make evolutionary sense, Kurzban,Tooby, and Cosmides created a social context in which race was not predictive ofa cooperative alliance. They found this drastically decreased the extent towhich subjects noticed race. They also demonstrated that any visual marker (theyused shirt color) that is correlated with patterns of cooperation and alliancewould be encoded, and in fact was encoded more strongly than race. It was onlyfour minutes into their experiment when their subjects no longer noticed race.They concluded that people are good at picking up on changing patterns ofalliance, and this is why they can adapt to different social worlds, one whererace was not the coalition predictor.Various emotions can be aroused by coalition membership: compassion for othergroups (by Shriners and walkathon participants, for example), contempt for othergroups (nonsmokers’ feelings for smokers), anger (by nonsmokers againstsmokers), guilt (for not supporting your group), shame (for betraying yourgroup), embarrassment (for letting “the team” down), and gratitude (house ownersto firemen). So this module would work: Recognized as part of my group: good,approach; not part of my group: bad, avoid. Coalition recognition has its rootsin mimicry; like mannerisms generate a positive bias. Virtues that are spawnedfrom in-group coalitions are trust, cooperation, self-sacrifice, loyalty,patriotism, and heroism.> > THE PURITY MODULEPurity has its roots in defending against disease: bacteria, fungi, andparasites—what Matt Ridley considers the competition.40 Without theirthreatening presence, there is no need for gene recombination or sexual (versusasexual) reproduction. We wouldn’t have to keep up with the Joneses, or in thiscase the Escherichia coli or the Entamoeba histolytica, which are constantlymutating to get better at attacking us so they can reproduce and survive.Disgust is the emotion that protects purity. Haidt suggests that the emotion ofdisgust arose when hominids became meat eaters. It appears to be a uniquelyhuman emotion.41 Obviously your dog doesn’t feel it. Look what he eats. Disgustis only one of the four reasons that humans reject food, but we share the otherthree reasons with other animals: distaste, inappropriateness (a stick), anddanger. Disgust implies the knowledge of the origins or the nature of food.Young infants will reject food that is bitter, but disgust doesn’t appear untilaround age five. Haidt and his colleagues suggest that the emotion of disgustinitially acted as a food rejection system, evidenced by its connection tonausea, concerns with contamination (contact with a disgusting substance), andfacial expressions associated with it, which mostly use the nose and mouth. Theyrefer to this as core disgust.Initially, disgust would guard against disease transmitters, such as rottingcorpses and carcasses, rotting fruit, feces, parasites, vomit, and the ill.Haidt suggests, “Human societies, however, need to reject many things, includingsexual and social ‘deviants.’ Core disgust may have been preadapted as arejection system, easily harnessed to other kinds of rejection.”41 Its purviewexpanded, and at some point disgust became more generalized to include aspectsof appearance, bodily functions, and some activities, including overindulgenceand some occupations, such as those having to do with corpses.> But if disgust evolved to serve these important adaptive functions—food> selection and disease avoidance—then it is particularly surprising that the> disgust response is almost totally lacking in young children. Indeed, young> children will put almost anything into their mouths, including feces, and the> full disgust response (including contamination sensitivity) is not in place> until around the age of five to seven. Contamination sensitivity is also not> found, so far as we know, in any non-human species.*> [Human_split_075.html#filepos1439279] Caution is therefore warranted in> proposing that disgust is important for biological survival. The social> functions of disgust…may be more important than its biological functions.41Indeed when the researchers had people from many different countries list thingsthat they found disgusting, they could be grouped into three general categoriesbeyond that of core disgust. The first category was things that reminded peopleof their animal nature, including death, sex, hygiene, all body fluids excepttears (which only humans have), and body envelope violations such as a missingpart, deformity, or obesity. The next category consisted of things that werethought to risk interpersonal contamination, which turns out to be less a formof body product contamination (people were only slightly less reluctant to wearlaundered clothes of another) than of contamination of their essence. Peoplewere more reluctant to wear the clothes of a murderer or of Adolph Hitler, thanof a well-liked person. The majority of things listed as disgusting by peoplefrom India fell in this category. The last grouping was moral offenses. ForAmerican and Japanese subjects, the majority of disgusting things on their listscame from this category, although they were very different. Americans weredisgusted at the violation of a person’s rights and dignity, whereas Japanesewere disgusted at violations to a person’s place in society.Disgust has a cultural component that varies among cultures, and children arecoached as to what it includes. This module mostly likely had biologicalorigins, which have widely expanded to include disgust that is not only elicitedby food but now can even include the actions of others. Unconsciously thismodule would say, Disgusting: dirty, bad, avoid; clean: good, approach. Irecently saw a sign that read, CLEAN HANDS MAKE GOOD FOOD. The purity module isalive and well in Santa Barbara.Over the passage of time, religious and secular laws and rituals have been maderegulating food and bodily functions, including hygiene, health, and diet. Oncethese laws are accepted, their violation results in a negative bias and a moralintuition. Other religious and moral concerns have been generalized to thepurity of the mind and body. Many cultures make virtues of cleanliness,chastity, and purity.Thalia Wheatley and Haidt42 have run an experiment to see if they could affectmoral judgments by increasing an emotion. They hypnotized two groups of peopleand told one group that whenever they read the word that, they would bedisgusted, and told the other group they would be disgusted by the word often.Then they had them read stories that had either one or the other word in them.Each group found the moral stories with their hypnotically suggested word in itmore disgusting. They even found that one-third of people will judge a storywith no moral violation in it somewhat morally wrong. Schnall, Haidt, and Cloretried a different approach by asking subjects moral questions while seatedeither at a dirty desk strewn with used fast-food wrappers and tissues or at aclean desk. People who had tested at the upper end of the scale for “privatebody consciousness” (those who are more aware of their physical state) made moresevere moral judgments when sitting at the dirty desk. A take-home lesson fromthis is that if you have had a forbidden party at your parents’ house while theyare gone for the weekend, be sure the house is spotless when they get home,because if they find out about it and the house is dirty… So if we all have these universal modules, why are cultures so different intheir moral standards? Haidt and Joseph answer this question by looking at thelink between our innate moral intuitions and the socially defined virtues. InHauser’s model, we have an innate preparedness to respond to the social world inparticular constrained ways. That means some things are easier to learn thanothers, and some things can’t be learned at all. Studies on animals have shownthat some things can be taught with just one trial, others can take hundreds oftrials, and some can never be learned. The classic example for humans is thefact that it is very easy to be taught to be afraid of snakes but nearlyimpossible to be taught to be afraid of flowers. Our fear module is prepared tolearn about snakes, which were a danger in our ancestral environment, but notflowers, which weren’t. When you ask children what they are afraid of, theanswer is lions and tigers and monsters, but not cars, which are very much morelikely to hurt them nowadays. Likewise, some virtues are easily learned, whereasothers are not. It is easy to learn to punish cheaters; it is difficult to learnto forgive them.Virtues are what the culture has defined as morally praiseworthy. Differentcultures value the output of the moral modules differently. Different cultureswill link more than one module together so they apply to broader stimuli. Hindushave linked purity to hierarchy and coalitions and come up with a caste system.Monarchies have done much the same and ended up with a class system, royalskeeping their bloodlines pure within a hierarchy of nobility. Cultures maydefine the virtues elicited by the different modules differently. Fairness isconsidered a virtue, but with what as its basis—fairness based on need? Orfairness based on those who work harder? Or fairness based on equaldistribution? And consider loyalty. Certain societies value loyalty to familywhereas others value loyalty to peer groups or a hierarchical structure, such asa town or country. In some cultures there may be complex virtues derived fromdifferent modules that are linked together to create a super virtue such ashonor, derived from the hierarchy, reciprocity, and purity modules in mosttraditional cultures.30> > THE RATIONAL PROCESSWith modules seemingly for almost everything, when does rational thinking kickin? Balzac marked the moment in Modeste Mignon with the statement “In love, whata woman mistakes for disgust is simply seeing clearly.”43 When this may happenis under debate at the current time. When are we motivated to think rationally?Well, we are motivated when we want to find the optimal solution. But what isthe optimal solution? Is it the actual truth, or is it one that verifies how yousee the world, or one that maintains your status and reputation?Let us say you want the accurate actual truth unaffected by any bias you have.This is easier when moral interpretations are not at stake. For example, “Ireally want to know which medication is best for me, and I don’t care how muchit costs, where it came from, who makes it, how often I have to take it, orwhether it is a pill, an injection, or a salve.” That is a much less threateningquestion than “Is it OK to harvest organs from condemned felons?” The othercondition is that we have enough time to think about it, so the automaticresponse doesn’t kick in. On the spur of the moment, will you take one of thedarling kittens being offered in front of the grocery store back to theapartment where you aren’t allowed to have pets and your roommate is allergic tocat dander? Or do you go home and think about it? And of course, one has to havethe cognitive ability to understand and use information that is pertinent.Then again, even when we are trying to think rationally, we may not be. Researchhas shown that people will use the first argument that satisfies their opinionand then stop thinking. David Perkins, a Harvard psychologist, calls this the“makes sense” rule.44 However, what people consider makes sense varies widely.It is the difference between anecdotal evidence (an isolated story that presumesa cause and effect) and factual evidence (a proven cause and effect.) Forinstance, a woman may believe birth control pills will make her sterile, becauseher aunt took birth control pills in the past, and now she can’t get pregnant.Anecdotal evidence, one story, was all she needed to support her opinion, and itmade sense. However, she does not consider the possibility that her aunt mayhave been unable to get pregnant before she started taking the birth controlpills, nor the possibility her aunt could have been infected with sexuallytransmitted bacteria, such as gonorrhea or chlamydia, that caused scarring inthe Fallopian tubes—which in fact is the leading cause of infertility. She alsodoes not know that using birth control pills will actually preserve herfertility better than nonhormonal methods (factual evidence). Predominantly,people use anecdotal evidence.45, 46Try this example, one of many that Deanna Kuhn, a psychologist at ColumbiaUniversity, used to investigate knowledge acquisition: Which statement is stronger?> A. Why do teenagers start smoking? Smith says it’s because they see ads that> make smoking look attractive. A good-looking guy in neat clothes with a> cigarette in his mouth is someone you would like to be like.> > B. Why do teenagers start smoking? Jones says it’s because they see ads that> make smoking look attractive. When cigarette ads were banned from TV, smoking> went down.In a large group of students ranging from eighth grade to graduate school, fewunderstood the differences between the two types of argument these represented,although the graduate students did the best. The first is anecdotal, and thesecond is factual. The implications of this are that even if a person seeks tomake a rational judgment, most people don’t use information in an analyticalmanner.47Looking at our evolutionary environment, Haidt points out that if our moraljudgment machinery were designed to always be accurate, the results could bedisastrous if you occasionally sided with the enemy, against your friends andfamily.1 He presents the social intuitionist model of moral reasoning. After theintuitive judgment and the post-hoc reasoning occur, Haidt suggests that thereare four possible circumstances in which this intuitive judgment may be altered.The first two involve the social world either by reasoned (not necessarilyrational) persuasion or by merely doing what everyone else is doing (again, notnecessarily rational). He suggests rational reasoning has an opportunity tobloom when an issue gets discussed with another person.Remember those social groups I talked about in the last chapter, in relation togossip? And what does gossip accomplish? It helps set standards of moralbehavior in a community. And what does everyone love to gossip about? Juicytidbits, and the juiciest of all are moral violations. That will turn adesultory conversation into a hot one. It’s much more interesting to learn thatSally is having an affair with a married man than to hear that she is having aparty. You can feel righteous yourself, and agree with your friend that marriedmen are off-limits, but what if you don’t agree with your friend? What if youknow that the man is married to a gold digger who married him for his money,they have no children, their house is now partitioned in two—she is on one sidehaving extravagant parties, and he is on the other spending his spare timemanaging the Web site for the local United Way—and they have no contact, exceptfor her refusing to sign divorce papers? Can you two have a rational discussionof facts and leave with someone having changed his or her mind?It depends on how strongly your emotions have kicked in on the case. We havealready learned that people will tend to agree with people they like, so if theissue is neutral or of little consequence, or if an argument hasn’t alreadyarisen, then social persuasion can come into play. These persuasive argumentsmay or may not be rational, as we just learned. You will use anything you thinkwill persuade the other to your viewpoint. If the two of you have really strongreactions, then don’t waste your time. And of course, really strong reactionsare what are at stake with moral issues. There is a reason for the adage of nottalking about religion or politics over a meal. Strong emotions lead toarguments, which are disruptive to the taste buds and lead to indigestion.As Robert Wright puts it in his book The Moral Animal, “By the time the arguingstarts, the work has already been done.” In steps the interpreter, and the badnews is, your interpreter is a lawyer. Wright describes the brain as a machinefor winning arguments, not as a truth finder. “The brain is like a good lawyer:given any set of interests to defend, it sets about convincing the world oftheir moral and logical worth regardless of whether they in fact have any ofeither. Like a lawyer, the human brain wants victory, not truth; and, like alawyer, it is sometimes more admirable for skill than for virtue.”48 He pointsout that one would think that if we were rational creatures, then at some point,we should wonder at the probability of always being right. Come to think of it,if we were all rational creatures, wouldn’t we all use pocket protectors?Persuasion can come in the form of merely being in a group of people. How manytimes have you thought people act like sheep? For instance, my daughter relatedher experience at the San Diego train station the day before Thanksgiving. Thetrain was late arriving, and when it was finally available for boarding, onlyone of the several doors to the platform was standing open. A long line ofpeople formed at that door. She walked to one of the closed doors and pushed itopen and stepped onto the train. Many studies have been done to illustrate howpeople are influenced by those around them. The creators of the TV show CandidCamera did some of their most hilarious skits with this in mind.Solomon Asch, a pioneer of social psychology, did a classic experiment. He setup a room of eight subjects (seven of whom were “plants”) and showed them aline. After concealing that line, he showed them another line that was obviouslymuch longer. He asked each person in the room if one of the lines was longerthan the other, but asked the real subject last. If the first seven people allsaid the lines were of equal length, the majority of test subjects agreed withthem.49 Social pressure made a person say something that was obviouslyincorrect.Stanley Milgram was a student of Asch. After receiving his doctorate in socialpsychology, he did some shock experiments that were truly shocking. Nopersuasion was involved here, just obedience. He told his subjects he wasresearching the effects of punishment on learning. However, what he was reallyresearching was obedience to an authority figure. He measured the willingness ofhis subjects to obey an authority figure, the researcher, who instructed them toperform acts that conflicted with their consciences. He told his subjects theywere randomly assigned to play either a teacher or a student role. The subject,however, was always assigned the teacher role. Milgram told the teacher toadminister an electric shock to the student (who, unbeknownst to the teacher,was an actor playing the part) every time the student got an answer wrong on aword-matching memory task, and to increase the shock for each mistake. The actorwas not actually shocked but pretended to be. The subject playing the teacherwas told that real shocks were being given. The instrument panel on the shockmachine read “slight shock” on one side of a dial and “severe shock” on theother, with numerical values from 0 to 30. Having previously asked people whatthey would do in such a circumstance, he expected most people would stop at alevel of 9. However, he was quite wrong. The subjects continued shocking thestudent to an average intensity of 20 to 25, with or without prodding from theexperimenter, even when the student was screaming or asking to leave. And 30percent went to the highest-level shock even when the student was pretending tobe listless or unconscious! If the teacher and student were in closer proximity,however, there was a 20 percent drop in obedience, suggesting that empathyencouraged disobedience.50, 51This study has been replicated in many countries. Obedience to the instructionshas been universal in several countries where the studies have been replicated,but among the countries, it varied from Germany, where 85 percent were willingto send the highest levels of shocks, to Australia, where it dropped to 40percent. This is an interesting finding, considering that modern Australia wasoriginally populated by prisoners, a rather disobedient gene pool! In the UnitedStates, 65 percent followed the instructions. That may be good news for trafficlaws, but we know where blind obedience leads.Haidt’s third possible scenario in which rational judgment is most likely to beused is what he refers to as the reasoned judgment link. In this instance, aperson logically reasons out a judgment and overrides his intuition. Haidtsuggests that this happens only when the initial intuition is weak and theanalytical capacity is high. Thus, if it is a low-profile case, in which thereis no emotional investment or only a little, the lawyer might go on vacation. Ifyou are lucky, a scientist* [Human_split_076.html#filepos1439598]52 covers forhim—but don’t count on it. If it is a high-profile issue, and the intuition isstrong, an analytical mind can force logic on its owner, but he may end up witha dual attitude, with his intuition just below the surface. So just maybe, if itis a high-profile case, the scientist may sit in on the argument and later,while sipping a digestivo, nudge the lawyer to shut up already.The fourth possible scenario is the private reflection link. Here, a person mayhave no intuition at all about an issue, or might be mulling over the situation,when suddenly a new intuition hits her that may override the initial one. Thiscan happen by imagining yourself on the other side of the issue. Then you arepresented with two competing intuitions. However, as Haidt points out, is thisreally rational thinking? Aren’t you right smack back in Damasio’s lap needingan emotional bias to help you pick between the two?> > MORAL BEHAVIORHow much does all this matter? Does moral reasoning correlate with moralbehavior? Do people who rationally evaluate moral behavior act in a more moralway? Apparently not exactly. There appear to be two variables that do correlateto moral behavior: intelligence and inhibition. Criminologists have found thatcriminal behavior is inversely related to intelligence, independent of race orsocial-economic class.53 Augusto Blasi found that IQ was positively related tohonesty.54 In this context, inhibition basically refers to self-control or theability to override an objective that your emotional system wants. You may wantto sleep in, but you will get up to go to work.Researchers headed by Walter Mischel, a psychologist at Columbia University,have been doing a very interesting long-term study on inhibition. They beganwith a study of preschoolers, using a food reward. One by one, children wereseated at a table and asked which was better, one marshmallow or two. We allknow what they answered. On the table were a marshmallow and a bell. Theresearcher (let’s call her Jeanne) told the child (Tom) that she had to leavethe room for a few minutes, and when she returned, he could have twomarshmallows. However, if Tom wanted her to come back early, then he could ringthe bell, but if he did that, she would give him only one marshmallow. Ten yearslater, the researchers sent questionnaires to the parents about their thenadolescent children, and found that those who delayed eating the marshmallowlonger in preschool were rated as more likely to exhibit self-control infrustrating situations, less likely to yield to temptation, more intelligent,and less distractible when trying to concentrate, and they earned higher SATscores.55 The team continues to follow these people today.How does self-control work? How does one say no to a tempting stimulus? Why didsome of those kids wait until the researcher returned while staring at themarshmallow? In the adult world, why are some people able to refuse the Death byChocolate cake on the dessert tray, or drive at the speed limit while everyoneis passing them?In order to explain how that aspect of willpower, “the ability to inhibit animpulsive response that undoes one’s commitment,” aka self-control, works,Walter Mischel and his colleague Janet Metcalfe proposed that there are twotypes of processing. One is “hot” and the other is “cool”; they involve neuralsystems that are distinct but still interact.56 The hot emotional system isspecialized for quick emotional processing. It responds to a trigger and makesuse of the amygdala-based memory. This is the “go” system. The cool cognitivesystem is slower and is specialized for complex spatiotemporal and episodicrepresentation and thought. The researchers call it the “know” system. Itsneuronal basis is in the hippocampus and the frontal lobes. Does this soundfamiliar? In their theory, they stress that the interaction of these two systemsis of critical importance to self-regulation and to decision making in regard toself-control. The cool system develops later in life and becomes increasinglyactive. How the two systems interact depends on age, stress (under increasingstress, the hot system takes over), and temperament. Studies have shown thatcriminal behavior decreases with age,57 giving support to the idea that the coolsystem that increases self-control becomes more active with age.> > MORALITY-FREE HUMANS: THE CASE OF THE PSYCHOPATHWhat about psychopaths? Are they different from most criminals or just wayworse? Psychopaths appear different on neuroimaging studies.58 They havespecific abnormalities that can be differentiated from simply antisocialindividuals and normal individuals. This suggests that their amoral behavior isdue to specific malformations of the cognitive structure of the brain.Psychopaths exhibit high intelligence and rational thinking. They are notdelusional. They know the rules of society and of moral behavior, but a moralprecept is just a rule to them.59 They don’t understand that it is OK to suspendthe societal rule “Do not eat with your hands at the table,” but it is not OK tosuspend the moral rule “Do not spit in the face of the person next to you at thetable.” They have a measurable decrease in ectodermal response to emotionallysignificant60 and empathetic stimuli61 compared with normal control subjects.They don’t have the moral emotions of empathy, guilt, or shame. Although they donot show impulsive behavior in one sense, they do have a one-track mindednessthat is not inhibited, which distinguishes them from normal individuals. Itappears that they are born psychopaths.> > PUTTING YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH ISIt has been hard to find any correlation between moral reasoning and proactivemoral behavior, such as helping other people. In fact, in most recent studies,none has been found,62, 63 except in one study done on young adults, in whichthere was a small correlation.64 As one might predict based on what we havelearned so far, moral behavior, as evidenced by helping others, is morecorrelated with emotion and self-control. Interestingly, Sam and Pearl Oliner,professors at Humboldt State University and founding directors of the AltruisticPersonality and Prosocial Behavior Institute, studied moral exemplars by lookingat European rescuers of Jews during the Holocaust.65 Whereas 37 percent wereempathically motivated (suffering module), 52 percent were primarily motivatedby “expressing and strengthening their affiliations with their social groups”(coalition module), and only 11 percent were motivated by principled stands(rational thinking).> > The Religion AssumptionWhere does religion fit in with all of this? If we have these moral intuitionswe are born with, what’s up with religion? Good question. But you have made anassumption. Haven’t you assumed that morals came from religion and that religionis about morals? Religions have been around since the very beginnings of humanculture, but in fact, only sometimes do they have anything to do with moralityand the salvation of a soul. You might say “But my religion does, and it istrue, and all the other ones are false.” Why are you so special? Every otherreligion thinks the same thing. Think about the coalition in-group intuitivebias. Pascal Boyer, an anthropologist who studies the transmission of culturalknowledge at Washington University in Saint Louis, points out that it is acommon temptation to search for the origin of religion in general human urges,such as the desire to define a moral system or explain natural phenomena. Heattributes this to people’s incorrect assumptions about religion andpsychological urges. With our current research techniques, we are able to dobetter than just throw ideas about religion out into the wind; we can prove ordisprove many of them. He has come up with a list of commonly posited reasonsfor the origins of religion, and he suggests a different viewpoint.66Do not say…But say…Religion answers people’s metaphysical questions.Religious thoughts are typically activated when people deal with concretesituations this crop, that disease, this new birth, this dead body, etc.).Religion is about a transcendent God.It is about a variety of agents: ghouls, ghosts, spirits, ancestors, gods, etc.,in direct interaction with people.Religion allays anxiety.It generates as much anxiety as it allays: Vengeful ghosts, nasty spirits, andaggressive gods are as common as protective deities.Religion was created at time t in human history.There is no reason to think that the various kinds of thoughts we call“religious” all appeared in human cultures at the same time.Religion is about explaining natural phenomena.Most religious explanations of natural phenomena actually explain little butproduce salient mysteries.Religion is about explaining mental phenomena (dreams, visions).In places where religion is not invoked to explain them, such phenomena are notseen as intrinsically mystical or supernatural.Religion is about morality and the salvation of the soul.The notion of salvation is particular to a few doctrines (Christianity anddoctrinal religions of Asia and the Middle East) and unheard of in most othertraditions.Religion creates social cohesion.Religious commitment can (under some conditions) be used as a signal ofcoalitional affiliation, but coalitions create social fission (secession) asoften as group integration.Religious claims are irrefutable; that is why people believe them.There are many irrefutable statements that no one believes; what makes some ofthem plausible to some people is what we need to explain.Religion is irrational/superstitious (therefore not worthy of study).Commitment to imagined agents does not really relax or suspend ordinarymechanisms of belief formation; indeed it can provide important evidence fortheir functioning (and therefore should be studied attentively).> TABLE 1: Do’s and Don’ts in the Study of Religion. From Pascal Boyer,> “Religious thought and behavior as by-products of brain function,” Trends in> Cognitive Sciences 7, no. 3 (2003): 119–24.When we talk about anything the brain believes or does, we have to go back toits structure and function. Religions are ubiquitous and thus are easy toacquire and transmit. They are tapping into modules that are used fornonreligious social activities but, as Marc Hauser said, are “prepared” to beused in other related ways. There is not just one part of the brain that is usedin religious thought; there are many areas that come into play. People who arereligious do not have a brain structure that atheists and agnostics do not have.But remember, the brain is also constrained. As Boyer puts it, there is alimited catalog of concepts; religion is not a domain where anything goes. Forinstance, in most religions, invisible dead souls are lurking somewhere, butinvisible thyroid glands are not. Gods are either people, animals, or man-madeobjects with some ability beyond the normal, but otherwise they still conform towhat we know about the world. A god has a theory of mind and may or may not haveempathy, but a god would never be a pile of cow dung, for instance, or just athumb.People do not require the same standard of evidence for religion that they dofor other aspects of their life. Why do people pick some parcels of incominginformation and not others to use for their belief systems? What we have learnedabout bias and emotion should help us out with that. The analytical mind israrely called in to help. Another interesting aspect has recently been teasedout of some research subjects. What people say they believe and believe theybelieve, and what they actually believe, are two different things. Instead ofthe omnipresent, all-doing, all-knowing God that they say they believe in, whenthey are not focused on their beliefs, they use another concept of God that ishumanlike. This God has serial attention (does only one thing at a time), aparticular location, and a particular viewpoint.67 Now that we know about theinterpreter, why doesn’t that surprise us?Boyer says religions seem “natural” because “a variety of mental systems,functionally specialized for the treatment of particular (non-religious) domainsof information, are activated by religious notions and norms, in such a way thatthese notions and norms become highly salient, easy to acquire, easy to rememberand communicate, as well as intuitively plausible.”68 Let’s look at our list ofthe moral intuitions and see how different aspects of religions can be seen asby-products of them.> > SUFFERINGThat one is easy. Many religions speak to the relief of suffering, or wallow init, or even seek to ignore it.> > RECIPROCITYEasy again. Many natural and personal disasters are explained as God’s or thegods’ payback for bad behavior, that is, punishing cheaters. Also, the socialexchange is ubiquitous in religion: “If you kill a bunch of innocent infidels,then you will go to paradise and have seventy virgins at your beck and call.”Does that work for women, too? Or “If you renounce all physical desires, thenyou will be happy.” Or “If I do this rain dance perfectly, then it will rain.”Or “If you cure my disease, then I will never do such and such again.”> > HIERARCHYEasy again. We can look at status. The person with the (appearance) of thehighest morals is given higher status and more trust. Gandhi was known to havebeen quite successful with the women (status). Popes ruled vast stretches ofEurope at one time (status, power, hierarchy). And how about the Ayatollah? Manyreligions are set up with a hierarchical structure; the most obvious is theCatholic Church, but it is not alone. Many Protestant religions, Islam, andJudaism all have hierarchical structures. Even in primitive societies, the witchdoctors held places of esteem and power in their communities. The Greek, Roman,and Norse gods also had hierarchical structures, as do the Hindu gods. God isthe big cheese, or there is a top god, like Zeus or Thor. You get the picture.The virtues of respect, loyalty, and obedience all morph over onto religiousbeliefs.> > COALITIONS AND IN-GROUP/OUT-GROUP BIASDoes anyone really need this spelled out? As in “My religion is right(in-group); your religion is wrong (out-group)”—just like soccer teams. Religionin its positive in-group form does create a community whose members help eachother, as do many social groups, but in its extreme form it has been responsiblefor much of the killing in the history of the world. Even Buddhists are dividedinto rival sects.> > PURITYThis too is obvious. “Uncontaminated food is good” has led to many religiousfood rituals and prohibitions. “Uncontaminated body is good” has led to certainsexual practices, or sex itself, being viewed as dirty and impure. How manyprimitive religions used virgins for sacrifice? We can start with the Aztecs andIncas and build. Women who have been raped are considered impure by the Muslimreligion and are regularly murdered by their male relatives in the practice of“honor killing,” a twisted combination of the purity and hierarchy modules.Buddhism has its “pure land” where all who call upon the Buddha will beguaranteed rebirth.Has religion provided a survival advantage? Has it been selected for byevolution? Attempts to prove this have not been satisfactory because no onesingle characteristic has been found that generates religion, as we can see fromBoyer’s table. Natural selection, however, has been at work on the mentalsystems that religion uses or, as some think, parasitizes. Religions can bethought of as giant social groups with strong coalitions, often withhierarchical structures, and reciprocity based on notions of purity either ofbody, mind, or both. Giant social groups can have a survival advantage, whetherthey are based on religion or not. Ideology can strengthen coalitionary bonds,and that in itself can increase group survival. So are religions examples ofgroup selection? This is a highly controversial question. D. S. Wilson pointsout that more is known about the evolution of the spots on a guppy than is knownabout the elements of religion.69 This is a work in progress.Can understanding how morality and religion came to be help us today? If weunderstand that our brain is a machine for hunter-gatherers in small groups,full of intuitive modules that react in certain ways, that it is not yet moldedfor huge societies, can that allow us to function better in our current world?It seems it can. Matt Ridley70 gives the example caused by the phenomenon knownas the “tragedy of the commons,” which was unfortunately misnamed by GarrettHardin, a biologist. He apparently did not distinguish between open-accessfree-for-alls and communally owned property. The phenomenon should have beennamed the “tragedy of the free-for-alls.” Land that is free for all is subjectto cheaters in social exchange. An individual would think, “If everyone canfish, hunt, and graze livestock on this land, then I should get as much as I cannow, because if I don’t, someone else will, and there will be none left for meand my family.”However, Hardin used grazing commons as his free-for-all example. What he didn’tknow was that most grazing commons were not free-for-alls. They were carefullyregulated community property. Ridley points out that free-for-alls and regulatedcommons are two very different things. “Carefully regulated” means that eachmember owns a right to something, such as fishing in a particular area, grazinga set number of animals, or having specific areas to graze. Now it is in theowner’s interest to maintain that area, which makes it possible to set up along-term social exchange: “If I graze only ten sheep and you graze only tensheep, then we will not overgraze the common, and it will sustain us for a longperiod.” Cheating no longer becomes attractive.Unfortunately, this misunderstanding of what was happening in much communalproperty led many economists and environmentalists in the 1970s to conclude thatthe only way to solve the cheating problem (which didn’t even exist in manycommunal setups) was to nationalize communal property. Instead of severalpatches of communally managed lands, one huge government-managed patch wascreated. This has resulted in fisheries being overfished, land being overgrazed,and wildlife being overhunted, because the fisheries, land, and wildlife becamea free-for-all on a grand scale. There were not enough enforcers to detect thecheaters, and only fools wouldn’t take all they could while they could.Ridley explains that this has been a disaster for the wildlife of Africa, wheremost countries nationalized their lands in the 1960s and 1970s. The wildlife wasnow owned by the government, and although it still did the same damage to cropsand competed for grazing, it was no longer a source of food or revenue—exceptfor poachers. There was no motivation to protect it and every motivation to getrid of it. Officials in Zimbabwe, however, realized what was happening. Theygave ownership of the wildlife back to the communities, and presto, theattitudes of the locals toward wildlife changed, and the animals became valuableand worth maintaining. The amount of private land owned by the villagers nowdevoted to wildlife has doubled.70Elinor Ostrom, a political scientist who has studied well-managed local commonsfor years, has shown in the laboratory that groups, when allowed to communicateand develop their own methods of fining free riders, can manage communalresources almost perfectly.71 And it turns out that those things that can bemanaged are those things that can be owned. We are territorial, just like chimpsand many other animals. Thus, understanding our intuitive reciprocity and itsconstraints, and the fact that we are most comfortable in smallish groups, canlead to better management practices, better laws, and better governments. Thisis just like understanding that the plant you bought that came from the desertshould not be watered as if it came from the tropics.> > DO ANIMALS HAVE A MORAL SENSE?Now this is an interesting question. Of course when we humans ask it, we areasking it from our own perspective, and the implied question is really Doanimals have a moral sense like ours? I have just presented the case that manystimuli induce an automatic process of approval (approach) or disapproval(avoid), which may lead to a full-on emotional state. The emotional stateproduces a moral intuition that may motivate an individual to action. Thesemoral intuitions have sprung from common behaviors we share with other socialspecies, such as being territorial; having dominance strategies to protectterritory; forming coalitions to garner food, space, and sex; and reciprocity.We share some aspects of this chain of events with other social species, and infact we have the same emotional reactions, which we term moral, to some of thesame inciting stimuli. We get angry at property violations or attacks on ourcoalition, just as chimps and dogs do. So in that sense, some animals have anintuitive morality that is species-based, centered on their own socialhierarchies and behaviors, and affected by the emotions that they possess.The differences lie in the wider range and complexity of moral emotions thathumans have, such as shame, guilt, embarrassment, disgust, contempt, empathy,and compassion, and in the behaviors these have contributed to. The most notableof these behaviors is prolonged reciprocal altruism, of which humans are theundisputed grand masters, but humans can also indulge in altruism and expect noreciprocity. I know that all you dog owners are now going to tell me that yourdog feels shame when you walk into the house and see that he has just chewedyour new shoes. But to feel shame, embarrassment, or guilt, which Haidt callsthe self-conscious emotions, an animal must have self-awareness beyondrecognizing his visible body and be conscious of that self-awareness. We aregoing to talk more about self-awareness and consciousness in chapter 8, but theshort version for now is that the presence of this expanded sense of self inother animals has yet to be discovered. Your scowl at the sight of the gnawedGuccis and your terse comment are what your dog is reacting to. The alpha animalis angry. The moral emotions of shame and embarrassment have their animal rootsin submissive behavior but have become more complex. You recognize thissubmissive cowering in your dog and call it shame, but that is a more complexemotion than it is feeling. Its emotion is fear of a swat or of getting draggedoff the couch, not guilt or shame.But in humans there is something going on in addition to more complex emotionsand their repercussions: the post hoc need to interpret the moral judgment orbehavior. The human brain alone seeks an explanation for the automatic reactionthat it has no clue about. This is the unique interpretive function of the humanbrain in action. I suspect that this is also the point where humans put a valuejudgment on their actions: good behavior or bad. To what degree the valuejudgment may match the emotional approach/withdraw scale is an interestingquestion. There are the occasions, however, when the rational self becomes anearlier participant in the judgment and informs the behavior. We humans caninhibit our emotionally driven responses. Then the conscious, self-aware mindsteps in, bellies up to the bar, and takes command. That is a uniquely humanmoment.> > CONCLUSIONDavid Hume and Immanuel Kant were both right in a way. As the neurobiology ofmoral behavior becomes fleshed out, we shall see that some of our repugnance forkilling, stealing, incest, and dozens of other actions is as much a result ofour natural biology as are our sexual organs. At the same time, we will alsorealize that the thousands of customs that people generate to live incooperation with each other are rules generated by the thousands of socialinteractions we have every day, week, month, and year of our lives. And all ofthis comes from (and for) the human mind and brain.One could say most of our life is spent battling the conscious rational mind andthe unconscious emotional system of our brain. At one level, we know that byexperience. In politics, a good outcome happens when the rational choice isconsonant with the emotions of the time. A lousy political decision occurs whena rational choice is made at a time when the emotions of the populace are atodds with the projected outcome. On a personal level, it can go a different way.A poor personal decision can be the product of a powerful emotion overriding asimple rational directive. For all of us, this battle is continuing and neverseems to go away.It is as if we are not yet comfortable with our rational, analytic mind. Interms of evolution, it is a new ability that we humans have recently come upon,and we appear to use sparingly. But, using our rational mind, we have comeacross other uniquely human traits: the emotion of disgust and a sensitivity tocontamination, the moral emotions of guilt, shame, and embarassment, blushing,and crying. We have also found that religions are large social groups that havetheir foundation in the notion of purity of either mind or body, anotheruniquely human construct with its roots in the moral emotion of disgust. And theknow-it-all interpreter is there, coming up with explanations for ourunconscious moral intuitions and behaviors. And we have our analytical brainoccasionally chiming in. Not only that, there is even more going on that wearen’t conscious of.

How do you know the milk your wife just sniffed is bad without her sayinganything? Do you know how a finalist for the women’s gold medal gymnasticcompetition feels when you see her miss a landing on the balance beam, fall, andbreak her ankle? How is that different from when you see a mugger running fromhis victim, trip in a pothole, fall down, and break his ankle? Why can you reada novel and feel emotions engendered by the story? They are just words on apage. Why can a travel brochure make you smile?If you can come up with some reasonable answers that satisfy you, consider thisone last phenomenon. Patient X, who has suffered a stroke, has this condition.His eyes can still take in visual stimuli, but the primary part of his visualcortex has been destroyed. He is blind. He cannot even distinguish light fromdark. You can show him pictures of circles or squares, or ask him to distinguishbetween photos of men or women, and he has no idea what is in front of him. Youcan show him snarling animal faces or calm animal faces, and he has nothing tosay, but if you show him pictures of angry or happy human faces, he, like someother patients with this kind of brain lesion, can guess what the emotions are.1He has what has come to be called blindsight.How do we recognize the emotional states of others? Is it a conscious appraisal,or is it automatic? There are a few schools of thought about this. One schoolholds that an individual uses her own version of psychology, which is eitherinnate or learned, and infers the mental state of others from how they areacting and what they are doing, where they are and whom they are with, and howthey have been in the past. This is called theory theory. The other school holdsthat one infers another’s emotional state by deliberately and voluntarilyattempting to simulate or replicate it in one’s own mind—first pretending to bein the other’s situation and seeing how that feels, then feeding thatinformation to the decision-making process, and ending up with what one thinksthe other is feeling. This is called simulation theory.2 Both of these theoriesare volitional. You actually decide to evaluate the other’s emotional state.Neither of them can explain patient X’s ability to determine emotions.In another form of the simulation theory, the simulation is not deliberate andvoluntary but automatic and involuntary.3 In other words, it just happenswithout your control or rational input. You perceive an emotional stimulusthrough your senses, and your body automatically responds to it by simulatingthe emotion, which your conscious mind can either recognize or not. This couldhelp us explain patient X. And of course there is the combo theory, which ispart theory theory and part simulation theory, part automatic and partvolitional. A lot of the controversy, as usual, seems to be about how much isautomatic, or voluntary, or a learned response. Because our social interactionsare vastly important to being human, and because recognizing the states of mind,emotions, and intentions of others is necessary to interact, how this all comesabout is extremely intriguing as well as controversial.There is also the question of empathy, and understanding why some individualsuse it selectively or lack it altogether. Other social animals share at leastsome of our capabilities, but is there something unique going on in our brainsthat allows us to have more complex interactions? Much evidence is accumulatingthat we automatically simulate the internal experiences of others, and that thissimulation contributes to empathy and theory of mind. Is it all automatic, ordoes the conscious brain contribute to such evaluations? Let’s see what has beendiscovered so far.> > VOLUNTARY SIMULATION: PHYSICAL IMITATIONAbout thirty years ago, the field of child development got a shock. Up untilthat time, it had been thought that when babies imitate a motor movement, it waslearned. The theory was that the visual perception of a movement and theexecution of the imitative movement by the motor system were independent of eachother and controlled by different parts of the brain. Then a study of imitativebehavior of young infants done by University of Washington psychologists AndrewMeltzoff and M. Keith Moore suggested perhaps the visual perception of a motormovement (such as tongue protrusion or lip smacking) and the production of themovement (actually copying the movement) were not separately acquired abilitiesbut were linked somehow.4 Since then, many independent studies5 have shown thatnewborns from the age of forty-two minutes to seventy-two hours can imitatefacial expressions accurately.6, 7Think about it. One can only be amazed what the brain is doing when it is lessthan one hour old. It sees there is a face with a tongue sticking out, somehowknows it too has a face with a tongue under its command, decides it will imitatethe action, finds the tongue in its long list of body parts, gives it a littletest run, commands it to be stuck out—and out it goes. How does she know atongue is a tongue? How does she know what neural system is in charge of thetongue, and how does she know how to move it? Why does she even bother doing it?Obviously, it was not learned by looking in a mirror, nor had anyone taught itto her. The ability to imitate must be innate.8Imitation is the beginning of a baby’s social interaction. Babies will imitatehuman actions, but not those of objects; they understand they are like otherpeople.9 The brain has specific neural circuits for identifying biologicalmotion and inanimate object motion, along with specific circuits to identifyfaces and facial movement.10 What can a baby do to enter the social world beforeit can sit up or control its head or talk? How can she engage another person andform a social link? When you first hold a baby, what links her to you and you toher are her imitative actions. You stick out your tongue, she sticks out hertongue; you purse your lips, she purses her lips. She doesn’t lie there like anobject but responds in a way that you can relate to. In fact it has been shownthat infants use imitation games to check the identity of persons, and do notuse only their facial features.11, 12After about three months of age, this type of imitation can no longer beelicited. Imitative abilities then develop that show that the infant understandsthe meaning of what is being copied: The imitative movements don’t have to beexact but are directed toward a goal. The infant puts the sand in the bucket,but the fingers on the shovel don’t have to be held in exactly the same way asthe fingers of the person showing her how to use the shovel; the goal is gettingthe sand in the bucket. We have all seen how young children play when they aretogether, so it comes as no surprise that children aged eighteen to thirtymonths use imitation in their social exchanges, take turns between being theimitator and the imitatee, share topics, and in short, use imitation ascommunication.13 Imitating others is a potent mechanism in learning andacculturation.14Voluntary behavior imitation appears to be rare in the animal kingdom. Noevidence of voluntary imitation by monkeys, regardless of how many years theyhave been trained,15, 16 has been reported, except in one study in whichimitative behavior was elicited in two Japanese monkeys who were so highlytrained that they had learned to follow the eye gaze of a human.17 So much for“monkey see, monkey do.” To what extent voluntary imitation exists in otheranimals is controversial. It depends on the definition of imitation and how manyother factors are involved, a few of which are whether the imitation is goaldirected, exact, motivated, social, or learned.18 It appears to exist to somedegree in the great apes and some birds, and there is some evidence that it ispresent in cetaceans.19 The fact that many people are watching for and testingfor imitation in the animal world but have found little evidence of it, and thefact that when it has been found, it has been of limited scope, indicate thatthe ubiquitious and extensive imitation in the human world is very different.> > INVOLUNTARY PHYSICAL IMITATION: MIMICRYThere is a difference between active imitation and what is known as mimicry,which is nonconscious imitation. In the last chapter, we learned a bit aboutnonconscious mimicry from the research done by John Bargh at New YorkUniversity. People will unconsciously copy mannerisms of others, and not onlywill they not know they are doing it, but they will not consciously realize theother person even has a mannerism they could be mimicking. That is not all. Weare virtual mimicking machines! People will not only mimic mannerisms but alsounconsciously mimic the facial expressions, postures, vocal intonations,accents,20 and even speech patterns and words of others.21 How often have younoticed when you telephone a friend that their relative or their roommate whoanswers the phone sounds like your friend? Or how about all those marriedcouples who start looking alike?Our faces are our most prominent social feature, and they reflect our emotionalstates, but they also react to the emotional states of others. This can happenso fast that you are not aware of either the other person’s expression or thatyou have had a reaction. In one experiment, subjects were shownthirty-millisecond exposures of happy, neutral, and angry faces. This is toofast for them to consciously realize that a face was seen. This image wasimmediately followed by pictures of neutral faces. Even though the exposure tohappy and angry faces was unconscious, the subjects reacted with distinct facialmuscle reactions that corresponded to the happy and angry faces. Their facialmuscular activity was measured by electromyography. Both positive and negativeemotional reactions were unconsciously evoked; this demonstrates that someemotional face-to-face communication occurs on an unconscious level.22People will also mimic body movements during conversation. One researchervideotaped a series of sessions in which she told a group of subjects about howshe had to duck to avoid being run into at a party and demonstrated by duckingto the right. The video revealed that as they were listening, the listenersmimicked her movements and had strongly tended to duck to the left—the mirrorimage of her movement.23 Have you ever noticed that your own speech pattern maychange when you are visiting different parts of the country or other countries?Partners in conversations will tend to match each other in rhythm of speech,length of pauses, and likelihood of breaking silences.24 All this is going onwithout your consciously willing it to happen. What’s the point?All this mimicking behavior greases the machinery of social interactions.Unconsciously, deep down in that automatic part of your brain, you formconnections with, and you like, other people who are similar to you. Think howoften you have said, “I liked her the second I met her!” or, “Just looking athim gave me the creeps!” Mimicry increases positive social behavior. Rick VanBaaren and colleagues at the University of Amsterdam have shown that individualswho have been mimicked are more helpful and generous not only toward theirmimicker but also toward other people present than are nonmimickedindividuals.25 Thus, when you mimic someone, it becomes more likely that thisperson will behave positively not only toward you but also toward other peoplearound you, by fostering empathy, liking, and smooth interactions.26 Thisbinding of people together through enhancing prosocial behavior may haveadaptive value by acting as social glue that holds the group together25 andfosters safety in numbers. These behavioral consequences provide suggestivesupport for an evolutionary explanation of mimicry.However, it is difficult to consciously mimic someone. Once we resort toconscious voluntary imitative behavior, we are just too slow. The wholeconscious pathway takes too long. Muhammad Ali, whose motto was “Float like abutterfly, sting like a bee,” and who moved about as fast as anyone, took aminimum of 190 milliseconds to detect a light flash and another 40 millisecondsto begin his punch. In contrast, one study found that it took college studentsonly 21 milliseconds to synchronize their movements unconsciously.27 Consciouslytrying to mimic someone usually backfires, looks phony, and throws thecommunication out of sync.A few years back, Charlotte Smylie and I were able to work out which hemispheresof the brain are involved in voluntary and involuntary commands.28 Testingsplit-brain patients, we showed that while both hemispheres can respond toinvoluntary responses, only the left hemisphere can carry out voluntaryresponses. In addition, the left hemisphere uses two different neurologicalsystems to carry out the voluntary, as opposed to the involuntary, responses.This is abundantly apparent when studying Parkinson’s disease. This diseasestrikes the neurological system that controls the involuntary spontaneous facialresponses. As a result, people suffering from Parkinson’s disease don’t show thenormal facial reactions when engaged in social interactions. They might actuallybe having a good time, but because of their “mask,” no one knows it. Parkinson’spatients talk about this with great despair.This tells us that physical action, such as mimicking facial expressions, isclosely linked to the visual perception of the face, and happens so quickly andautomatically that it seems there must be some closely linked neuronal pathways.But what is behind the action? There is a smile or a sneer, but what does thatimply? Does the other person actually feel the emotion of the mimicked facialexpression? Does this mimicry help us figure that out?> > EMOTIONAL MIMICRY?If nonconscious automatic mimicry occurs with physical actions, does the samething happen when observing emotional states? When I cut my finger, do youautomatically copy how I am feeling and wince, or do you consciously reason itout? How about that shiver that you get up your spine? Do you consciouslyproduce that, or is it an automatic response? If we automatically mimic a sadface (merely the physical action), do we actually feel sad, too? If we do feelthe emotion, which comes first, the facial expression or the emotion? If wesense the emotion of the other, such as feeling sad, is it automatic? Or once wehave the automatic sad face, do we consciously say to ourselves, “Gee, I seem tohave this expression on my face that I remember I’ve had when I felt sad, andSam has the same dang expression on his face, so I guess he must feel sad. Iremember the last time I felt sad, and I didn’t like that feeling and I bet hedoesn’t, either. Poor guy.”Do we consciously or unconsciously simulate the emotional states of others? Ifso, how do we do it, and how do we recognize which emotion it is? We need to bea bit careful here. I just casually threw in a word in the last paragraph that Iwonder if you even noticed: feeling. Antonio Damasio has made a point ofseparating the definitions of emotion and feeling. He defines a feeling as “theperception of a certain state of the body (the emotion) along with theperception of a certain mode of thinking and of thoughts with certain themes.”Your body can respond to a stimulus with an automatic emotion, but not untilyour conscious brain recognizes it can you say you have a feeling. He emphasizesthe point that the emotion is what causes the feeling, not the other way around.This is contrary to the way most people think the brain works.29> > EMOTIONAL CONTAGIONLet’s start with babies. How about when you go to the newborn nursery and allthe babies are crying at once? Can it be that all of them are hungry and wet atthe exact same time? No, not with all those nurses running around. Studies withnewborns have shown that when they are exposed to the crying of another infant,a distress response is induced, and they will join in. However, when they heartheir own cry that has been tape-recorded and played to them, or the cries of ababy several months older than they, or other random loud noises, a distressresponse is not induced, and they don’t cry. The fact that babies are able todiscriminate between their own cry and other infants’ cries suggests that theyhave some innate understanding of the difference between themselves andothers.30, 31Is this a rudimentary expression of emotional contagion? That is the tendency toautomatically mimic facial expressions, vocalizations, postures, and movementsof another person and consequently to converge emotionally with them.27 Itcertainly seems to be, because if it were just a response to crying or loudnoises in general, the newborn should cry even when he hears his own recordedcries, not just the cries of others. It also does not support theory theory,because then we would have to suppose the baby is thinking like this: “Aidan,Liam, and Seamus are crying in the bassinets all around me, and I know when Icry it is because I am hungry, wet, or thirsty, which, of course, isuncomfortable. Well, I feel fine, though. My diapers are dry, I just ate, and Iam ready for a snooze.But those guys must be miserable, just listen to them. I think I’ll show alittle baby solidarity and make a stink too.” Perhaps a bit too sophisticatedfor a three-hour-old, who has not yet developed the ability to consciouslyrecognize that others have separate beliefs and emotions.Now consider this situation: You are laughing with a friend when the phone ringsand she answers it. You are feeling great, you’re sitting in the warm spring sunenjoying a steamy cappuccino, but now you look over at your friend’s face, andyou know something is dreadfully wrong. In a second, you no longer feel great,but anxious. You have caught her mood in a single glance.An interesting experiment done by Roland Neumann and Fritz Strack, psychologistsat the University of Würzburg, Germany, demonstrates mood contagion. They wereinterested in finding out if a person who had no social motivation to interactwith another person would still take on his mood. They also wanted to know ifthis was automatic or a result of taking the perspective of another. In order tofigure this out, they had subjects listen to a tape recording of a rather dryphilosophical text being read by an unknown person in a happy, sad, or neutralvoice. Meanwhile, they also gave their research subjects a small physical taskto do while they were listening. This was to divert their attention from theactual meaning of what was being read and the emotionality of the voice, so thatwouldn’t influence them. Then they were asked to read the same text out loudwhile they themselves were taped. The subjects not only automatically mimickedthe tone of voice of the other person—happy, sad, or neutral—but what was evenmore interesting, they also took on the mood of the mimicked voice. They werealso completely unable to recognize why they felt the way they did, and theyhadn’t realized that the voice they were mimicking had been happy or sad.32 Soalthough there never was nor would be an actual social interaction, and the textthat they were reading was not emotionally charged, and their attention to itscontent had been diverted, they still automatically mimicked the vocal tone andfelt the same mood as the voice had indicated the reader was feeling.These researchers define an emotion as having two components—a mood, andknowledge of why the mood is being felt. Mood is defined as the experiencecomponent itself, without the knowledge.Neumann and Strack then did one further experiment. Up until this point, theyhad diverted the attention of the subject so that she had not noticed that theperson whose voice she had been listening to had expressed an emotion. In thislast experiment, they asked half of the subjects to adopt the perspective of thereader, with the idea that the subject would then consciously recognize theemotional component of the voice. Afterward, the subjects who had been directedto take the reader’s perspective were able to identify that they had felt theemotion of sadness or happiness.> > Infants Take On the Mood of Their MothersBabies are affected by their depressed mothers. Studies of infant-mother pairsreveal that depressed mothers typically show flat affect, provide lessstimulation, and respond less appropriately to their infant’s actions. Theirinfants are less attentive, have fewer contented expressions, and are more fussyand less active33, 34 than babies with mothers who are not depressed. Theseinfants are physiologically aroused by interactions with their depressedmothers: They have stress reactions, which are revealed by elevated heart rateand cortisol levels.35 They also appear to have a depressed mood, despitedifferences in the way their depressed mothers treated them.36 Unfortunately,these interactions can have long-term effects on these children.Of course, the phenomenon of mood contagion should not come as a completesurprise to us. We come out of the grocery store laughing and feeling good afterlistening to the banter of a funny cashier, or when a smiling stranger nods atus. Living with a depressed roommate or family member puts a cloud on the wholehousehold. One depressed, angry, or negative dinner guest can ruin a party,whereas a group of simpatico guests will spell its success. Moods are subtle andcan be affected by a word or a painting or music. With knowledge about moodcontagion, we can increase the frequency of good moods by putting ourselves inplaces “infected” with good moods so we can catch them! Such places includecomedy clubs, bustling restaurants, funny movies, parks with kids having fun andlaughing, colorful rooms, and outdoor locales with beautiful scenery. So moodsand emotions appear to be automatically contagious. What is going on in thebrain to make this happen?> > Neural Mechanisms for Emotional Contagion?Let’s see if we can find out from neuroimaging studies how and why emotionalcontagion happens. Two emotional states that have been well studied in humansare disgust and pain—“yuck and ouch.” These sound like excellent material forwhat we are interested in. Good thing there are psychology students! (“Hi, I’dlike to volunteer for the disgusting experiment or, if that one is full, howabout the pain one?”)One group of volunteers watched a film of someone sniffing different fragrances,either disgusting ones, pleasant ones, or neutral ones, while their brain wasbeing scanned with fMRI. Then they each had their turn at sniffing the samerange of fragrances. It turned out that the same areas of the brain, the leftanterior insula and the right anterior cingulate cortex, were automaticallyactivated, both during the observation of disgusted facial expressions in thevideo and while experiencing the emotion of disgust evoked by the unpleasantfragrance. This suggests that the understanding of the facial expressions ofdisgust in someone else involves the activation of the same part of the brainthat normally is activated during the experience of that same emotion.The insula is busy in other ways, too. It also responds to gustatorystimulation: not just disgusting fragrances but disgusting tastes. Electricallystimulating the anterior insula during neurosurgery results in nausea or thesensation of being about to vomit,37 visceromotor activity (that queasy feelingyou get), and unpleasant sensations in the throat and mouth.38 So the anteriorinsula participates in transforming unpleasant sensory input, whether it isactual perception of the disgusting odor or flavor or merely observing someoneelse’s facial reaction, into visceromotor reactions and the accompanyingphysical feeling one gets with the emotion of disgust.So, at least for disgust, there is a common area in the brain that is activatedfor visually seeing the facial expression of the emotion in someone else, forone’s own visceral response, and for feeling the emotion39—a tidy little brainpackage. The expression of disgust that you see on your wife’s face when shesniffs the sour milk activates your own disgust emotion. Luckily, you don’t needto sniff it yourself. Obviously this has an evolutionary advantage. Yourcompanion takes a bite of the rotting gazelle carcass and makes the disgustface. Now you don’t have to test it. Interestingly, the same did not hold truefor the pleasant fragrance. Pleasant fragrances activate the posterior rightinsula only, and we know we don’t get the same visceromotor response.Pain also appears to be a shared experience. In the movie Marathon Man, we allcringed at the dental torture scene. In our brains, there is an area thatresponds to both the observation of pain and the experience of pain. Volunteercouples were scanned with fMRI while one was being given a painful shock to thehand and the other was an observer. There are anatomical connections betweenregions that make up the pain system in the brain; these do not functionindependently but are highly interactive. However, there appears to be aseparation between the sensory (“that hurts!”) and emotional perceptions ofpain, such as its anticipation and the anxiety that it produces (“I know it’sgoing to hurt, oh, hurry up and get it over with, ohhh, when is it going tohappen?”). What the scans showed was that both the observer and the recipient ofpain had activity in the part of the brain that is active with the emotionalperception of pain,* [Human_split_077.html#filepos1439852] but only therecipient had activity in the area that is active with the sensory experience,†[Human_split_078.html#filepos1440124]40 which is a good thing. You wouldn’t wantthe paramedic himself to need to be anesthetized while he was stabilizing yourbroken femur, but you do want him to be gentle with your painful leg: You wanthim to realize it hurts but not to feel it himself to the point of inaction.Clearly, whether you anticipate the pain for yourself or another, the same areain the brain is used. Looking at pictures of humans in painful situations alsoactivates brain activity in the area that is active in the emotional appraisalof pain,‡ [Human_split_079.html#filepos1440415] but not the area that is activewith the actual sensation of pain.41 There is evidence the same neurons mediatethe emotional appraisal of both personal and vicarious pain. In rare cases,patients who have had portions of their cingulate removed have had testing ofneurons under local anesthesia with microelectrodes. This has shown that thesame neuron in the anterior cingulate fired upon experiencing a painful stimulusand also while anticipating or observing one.42 This indicates that theobservation of an emotion in someone else can result in brain activity thatmatches the experience of the emotion, to a certain degree, automatically.These findings have very interesting implications for the emotion of empathy.Without going into a long discussion of the definition of empathy, we can atleast agree that it implies being able to detect accurately the emotionalinformation being transmitted by another person, being conscious of it, andcaring about it. To care about another’s state is an altruistic behavior, but itcannot occur without good information. If I cannot accurately detect youremotion, if I think that you are disgusted when in fact you are in pain, I willreact to you inappropriately, perhaps handing you a Compazine suppositoryinstead of Advil.Tania Singer and colleagues at the University College London, who did the painresearch with the couples, wondered, as you may too, if observers who had higherpain-related brain activity were more empathetic. So they gave the couples astandardized test that rates emotional empathy and empathetic concern. Indeed,the individuals who scored higher on general empathy scales did show strongerbrain activity in the portions of the brain that were active when they perceivedtheir partner as being in pain. There was also a correlation between howempathetic one rated oneself and how much activity there was in the anteriorrostral zone of the cingulate, an area near the center of the brain. Also in thesecond study, when people looked at pictures of painful situations, the activityin the anterior cingulate was strongly correlated with their ratings of theothers’ pain. The more activity, the higher they rated the pain, suggesting thatthe activity of this brain region varies according to subjects’ reactivity tothe pain of others.The work on disgust and pain suggests that the simulation of these emotions isautomatic. The question remains whether the simulation of the emotion comesfirst and then the automatic physical mimicry follows, or the automatic mimicryis followed by the emotion. When you see your wife’s face after she sniffs thesour milk, do you automatically copy her expression, and then feel the disgust,or do you see her facial expression of disgust, feel disgust yourself, and thenautomatically make the disgust face? The chicken-and-egg problem continues to beunresolved in this particular case.> > PHYSIOLOGICAL SIMULATIONWhen you feel a negative emotion, such as fear, anger, or pain, you also get aphysiological response, just as babies have a stress response to hearing othernewborns crying or when interacting with a depressed mother. Your heart racesand you may sweat or get the shiver up your back, and so forth. In fact, you geta different set of physiological responses with each different emotion.43, 44They are emotion-specific. Would your physiological response to an observedsituation be able to predict how accurately you interpreted the emotion of theother person? If your physiological response were more similar to the otherperson’s, would you be better at judging her emotion?That is what Robert Levenson and colleagues at the University of California,Berkeley, demonstrated happens for negative emotions. They measured fivephysiological variables* [Human_split_080.html#filepos1440686] in subjects asthey watched four separate videotaped conversations between married couples.These same measurements had been taken of the couples as they were having theconversations. Throughout the conversations, the subjects assessed what theythought the husband or the wife was feeling. The subjects whose autonomicphysiological responses more closely simulated those of the person they wereobserving did indeed interpret his or her negative emotions more accurately.This did not hold true for positive emotions. These results suggest a relationbetween physiological linkage (how closely one simulates the physiologicalresponse) and rating accuracy for negative emotions. The researchers suggestthat empathetic subjects (i.e., those who are most accurate in rating thenegative emotions of targets) would be most likely to experience the samenegative emotions. These negative emotions would produce similar patterns ofautonomic activation in both subject and target, thus resulting in high levelsof physiological linkage.45 The other question this presents is, “Do people whoare more sensitive to their physiological responses have more intense emotionalfeelings? If I am acutely aware (conscious) that my heart is beating faster andI am sweating, am I more anxious or scared than someone who doesn’t notice? If Ipay more attention to my physiological responses, am I more empathetic toothers?”Hugo Critchley and colleagues at Brighton and Sussex Medical School, England,provided the answer to this question and also found out a little bonusinformation.46 They gave a group of people a questionnaire that rated symptomsof anxiety, depression, and positive and negative emotional experience. None ofthe subjects scored in the range necessary for a diagnosis of either depressionor anxiety. Then they were scanned with fMRI while judging whether an auditoryfeedback signal, a repeated musical note, was synchronous with their heartbeator not. This measured their attention to a physiological process—theirheartbeat. They were also asked to listen to a series of notes and distinguishwhich one was a different tone. This was to test their perception, how well theycould distinguish differences in sensory input. This separates how intensely onefeels a pain (perception) from how intensely one focuses on it (attention).The researchers also measured the size of the activated brain regions. Theyfound that activity in the right anterior insular and opercular cortex predictedsubjects’ accuracy in detecting (attention) their heartbeat. And the size ofthat particular portion of the brain itself mattered! The larger it was, themore accurate the person was at detecting their internal physiological state,and these same people also had higher self-ratings of body awareness. However,not everyone who had rated themselves high in body awareness was actually goodat detecting their heartbeat. This was that old problem of people thinking theyare better at something than they are. With one exception, those who wereactually good at detecting their heartbeat were only those with a greater volumeof that particular brain area: big right anterior insula, more bodyself-awareness, more empathy. The exception was that subjects who had scoredhigher in past negative emotional experiences also had increased accuracy indetecting their heartbeat.These findings indicate that the right anterior insula is involved with visceralresponses that can be recognized (which we already learned from the disgustexperiments) and that recognizing these responses can lead to subjectivefeelings. Some people are better at recognizing these internal signals thanothers. Some people are just born that way with a larger insula, but also somehave acquired the ability by having had more negative experiences in their past.These results may explain why some people are more aware of their feelings thanothers.47> > PAIRED DEFICITSThe above findings, coupled with the findings that increased neural activityassociated with the emotional component of pain increases empathy, make onewonder: If one can’t feel an emotion (no brain activity, no physiologicalresponse), can one recognize it in someone else? This questions one of the maintenets of simulation theory—that we simulate the other person’s state of mindand then, from our own personal experience of that state of mind, we predict howthe other is feeling or what his behavior will be. Is this true? Are therepaired deficits? If a person has a lesion in their insula, do they neither feelnor recognize disgust? If nothing disgusts me, can I recognize disgust in you?What if there is a lesion in the amygdala, what does that do? If we look atpeople who have a brain lesion that affects a particular emotion, does it changetheir ability to detect that emotion in another?These paired deficits have indeed been shown to exist. Andrew Calder andcolleagues at Cambridge University tested a patient with Huntington’s diseasewho had damage to his insula and putamen. They hypothesized that because theinsula has been shown in neuroimaging studies to be involved with the emotion ofdisgust, their patient should be limited in his ability to recognize disgust inothers and also should have less of a disgust reaction himself. This turned outto be true. He didn’t recognize disgust from facial signals or from verbalsignals, such as retching, and he was less disgusted than controls bydisgust-provoking scenarios.48Ralph Adolphs and colleagues at Caltech and the University of Iowa had a patientwith a rare bilateral insula lesion. He was unable to recognize disgust infacial expressions, actions, descriptions of actions, or pictures of disgustingthings. When he was told a story about a person vomiting, then asked how thatperson would feel, he said they would be “hungry” and “delighted.” Afterobserving someone act out vomiting unpalatable food, he said, “Delicious foodwas being enjoyed.” He could not recognize disgust in others, nor did he appearto feel the emotion of disgust. He is reported to eat indiscriminately,including items that are not edible, and he “fails to show any disgust tofood-related stimuli, such as pictures of food covered with cockroaches.”49Remember from the last chapter that disgust appears to be a uniquely humanemotion.Now back to the amygdala. We just learned that the amygdala is part of the painsystem, but we have seen in a previous chapter that it is also concerned withfear. Adolphs and his team have found that people with right hemisphere lesionsto their amygdala have impaired recognition of various negative facialexpressions, including fear, anger, and sadness, but people with lesions to theleft hemisphere amygdala are able to recognize these expressions. Amygdalalesions did not affect the ability to recognize happy expressions.50 Patientswith bilateral lesions of the amygdala (although it is the damage to the rightside that is causing the problem) appear to have selective impairment ininterpreting fearful expressions.50, 51, 52 In a group of nine patients withbilateral amygdala damage (there are very few people with lesions like this),although they intellectually understood what should be a frightening situation(a car coming at them, confronting a violent person, illness and death), theycould not recognize fear in the facial expressions of others.53 In a differentstudy, a patient with bilateral amygdala damage did not recognize fear in thefacial expressions, emotional sounds, or posture of others. His own everydayexperience of both the emotions of anger (an emotion he had no problem inrecognizing in others) and fear were reduced, compared with neurologicallynormal controls. His low fear level allowed him to engage in such activities asjaguar hunting in the Amazon River basin and hunting while hanging from ahelicopter in Siberia.54 These patients have shown us that not perceiving theemotion and not feeling the emotion are linked, and they suggest that a neurallesion preventing one from feeling or simulating an emotion may also prevent onefrom recognizing it in others.And what about patient X, the blind stroke victim who can guess emotional facialexpressions? When he was scanned with fMRI while doing so, his right amygdalabecame active.1 Remember when we learned about the fast-track pathway for fear,whereby incoming information goes to the thalamus and then straight to theamygdala? That is what is happening with patient X. The visual stimuli can stillgo to the amygdala even if the connection to the visual cortex has beendisrupted, and the amygdala still does its job. The amygdala is not connected tothe speech center. It does not tell the speech center, “I just saw a reallyscared face,” so patient X can guess that the photo being presented to him is ofa scared person. Instead, the amygdala creates a feeling. Patient X isautomatically simulating a feeling; then he can guess the expression based onhow he is feeling. He did not need the conscious brain to recognize the emotion!All this talk about activating areas in the brain is actually referring to thefact that a neurochemical process is going on in that region. Another way toinvestigate emotion recognition is to artificially block an emotion with a drugthat suppresses it, and then see if the subject can recognize the emotion insomeone else. This was done in a study of anger recognition. One form of humanaggression occurs over disputes about property or dominance, and it isassociated with the facial expression of anger. Your neighbor thinks the stripof property between your driveways is his; you think it is yours. He gets madwhen he sees you have dug it up and planted roses, so he digs them up. You getmad.Andrew Lawrence, Trevor Robbins, and colleagues at Cambridge postulated that aseparate neural system might have evolved specifically to recognize and respondto this specific threat or challenge. In many animals, it has been shown thatincreased attention to these types of aggressive encounters is associated withthe body producing increased levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine. If ananimal is given a drug that blocks the action of dopamine, this impairs thereactions to these types of encounters but does not affect its locomotion—so ifit doesn’t react to an aggressive act, you know it isn’t because it can’t move.You could still chainsaw your neighbor’s prize sycamore tree that drops leavesall over your lawn, but you don’t. They wondered if blocking the dopamine wouldnot only decrease the reaction to anger expressions but also decrease therecognition of anger expressions.This is indeed what happened. “Why, Fred, by golly, you seem to have dug up myroses. What about those Sox anyway?” Even more interesting, there was no effecton the ability to recognize all other emotions. “By the way, your wife islooking at you with a rather disgusted expression, what’s up with her?” Theimplications of a distinct system for the processing of specific emotionalsignals (e.g., fear, disgust, and anger) support psycho-evolutionary approachesto emotion. They suggest that distinct systems may have evolved for thesenegative emotions in order to detect and coordinate flexible responses todifferent ecological threats or challenges.55> > DO OTHER ANIMALS SIMULATE BEHAVIOR AND EMOTIONS?There is evidence for a similar type of automatic emotional simulation innonhuman primates. Emotional mimicry has been identified in the lab withmonkeys. And just as with humans, damage to the amygdala in macaque monkeysresults in monkeys with reduced fear and aggression and increasedsubmissiveness.56 They were tamer and abnormally friendly. If these monkeys alsosimulated emotions, and the amygdala has a role in their emotion of fear similarto its role in humans, then you would expect that parts of their amygdala wouldbe active when they viewed another individual with a fearful expression.Single-neuron studies have shown that this occurs. Emotional contagion isevident in monkeys. It has also been shown in rats and pigeons. So emotionalcontagion is not unique to humans. Many researchers think it is the foundationstone necessary for the more highly evolved emotion of empathy, which requiresconsciousness and altruistic caring.The question as to whether empathy is a uniquely human emotion, or whether otheranimals share it, is actively being researched, with partisans in both camps.Everyone agrees that the extent of human empathy far surpasses its extent inother animals. Studies have shown that rats that have been trained to press abar for food will stop pressing it if another visible rat gets a shock when thelever is pressed.57 Various permutations of such tests have been done, but thebasic question remains. Does the rat stop pressing the bar because ofaltruistic, empathetic impulses, or does he stop because the experience ofseeing another rat being shocked is unpleasant? The difference is between aresponse to a visually perceived unpleasantness versus all that constitutesempathy: theory of mind, self-awareness, and altruism. This dilemma also plaguesother studies that have been done with rhesus monkeys. Tests have yet to bedesigned that convincingly tease these two responses apart.Another avenue of exploration is chimpanzee yawning. In a group of chimps,one-third will yawn while watching videos of other chimps yawning.58 Some 40 to60 percent of people will yawn while watching videos of yawning. I am yawningright now. It has been suggested that contagious yawning may be a primitive formof empathy. Steve Platec and colleagues suggest that, rather than just being animitative action, it uses parts of the brain that are associated with theory ofmind and self-awareness.59 He found that people who were more susceptible tocontagious yawning also could identify their own face faster and do better ontheory-of-mind tasks. He has evidence from neural imaging that supports thisidea.60 Humans’ empathetic behavior far surpasses contagious yawning, of course.It is no surprise that we have discovered some foundational behavior in thechimps, but so far, evidence for the altruistic, conscious empathy that humanspossess is elusive in other animals.> > MIRROR NEURONS AGAINHow does the brain link observation of a facial expression with the action ofcopying it? How does it link facial expressions with particular emotions? Youmay already have started to wonder about those mirror neurons again. Thosepuppies are important! The first concrete evidence that perhaps there was aneural link between observation and imitation of an action was the discovery ofmirror neurons, which we talked about in chapters 1 and 2. If you recall, thesame premotor neurons fired both when a macaque monkey observed othersmanipulating an object, such as by grasping, tearing, or holding it, and when itexecuted the action itself. Mirror neurons for hearing have also been found inmonkeys, so that the sound of an action in the dark, such as ripping paper,activates both these auditory mirror neurons and the action neurons for theaction of ripping paper.61We already have learned that since that time, several studies have shown theexistence of a similar mirror system in humans. For instance, a group ofsubjects were studied with an fMRI scanner, either while they merely watched afinger being lifted, or while they watched and then copied the movement. Thesame cortical network in the premotor cortex was active in both conditions, justwatching, or watching and doing, but it was more active in the secondcondition.62 In humans, the mirror system is not restricted to hand movementsbut has areas that correspond to movements all over the body. There is also adifference when there is an object involved in the action. Whenever an object isthe target of action, another area of the brain (the parietal lobe) is alsoinvolved. A specific area will be active if a hand is using an object, such aslifting a cup, and a different area will be active if the mouth is acting on anobject, perhaps sucking on a straw.63 It is not possible to locate individualmirror neurons in humans as it is in the monkey, owing to the type of testingprocedures. However, mirror neuron systems have been found in several areas ofthe human brain.There is a distinct difference, however, between the mirror neurons in themonkey and the systems we humans have. The mirror neurons in the monkey fireonly when there is goal-directed action, such as when they see a hand grasp anice cream cone and move it to the mouth, which happened to be the case when thefirst mirror neurons were seen firing (although it was actually a gelato). Inhumans, however, the mirror system fires even when there is no goal.64 A handrandomly waving in the air will cause the system to activate. This may explainwhy, although monkeys have mirror neurons, there is very limited imitation. Themonkey’s mirror system is tuned to the goal and does not code all the details ofthe action leading to the goal.65The prefrontal lobe also plays an important role in imitation,66 and humans,with their larger prefrontal cortex, may just have the advantage over monkeys bybeing able to build more complex motor patterns. We can watch someone play aguitar chord, and copy it movement for movement. We can take dance lessons andimitate our instructor as he sambas across the floor. A monkey would understandonly that we went to the other side of the room, not that gyrating wasnecessary. The fact that monkeys have a less complex system helps us understandthe evolutionary development of the mirror neuron system. Giacomo Rizzolatti andVittorio Gallese originally proposed that the function of the mirror neuronsystem was to understand action (I understand that a cup is being lifted to themouth). This action understanding is present in both monkeys and humans.However, in humans, the mirror neuron system is capable of doing much more. Arehumans unique because they are the only animal that can samba?What all are the mirror systems involved in? As we saw above, they are involvedwith immediately copying actions. It has also been found that they are involvedwith understanding why the action is being done, its intention.67 I understandthat a cup is being lifted to the mouth (the action understanding of the goal)to see how its contents taste (the intention behind the action). The same actionis coded differently if it is associated with different intentions, therebypredicting the likely future unobserved action. In monkeys, a different set ofmirror neurons activates if food is grabbed to be lifted to the mouth, or to beput in a cup. (I understand that the food is being grabbed to be eaten versusbeing grabbed to be put in a cup.) Not only do you understand someone isgrabbing a candy bar, you understand she is going to eat it or put it in herpurse or throw it out or, if you’re lucky, hand it to you.Are there mirror neurons for understanding emotion, too, or are they just forphysical actions? The findings that we discussed above of the paired deficits infeeling and recognizing disgust and pain are suggestive that there are mirrorsystems located in the insula, which, as in action understanding, are involvedwith emotion observation and with understanding mediated through thevisceromotor response.68 The theory that mirror neurons are involved in emotionobservation and understanding (which contributes to social skills) has led twogroups of researchers* [Human_split_081.html#filepos1440967] to suggest thatsome of the symptoms of autism may be caused by a defect in the mirror-neuronsystem. These symptoms include lack of social skills, lack of empathy, poorimitation, and language deficits. Although Rizzolatti used electrodes to studymirror neurons in monkeys, researchers in San Diego have come up with a way totest for mirror neurons in humans without using electrodes.69One of the components of EEGs, the mu waves, are blocked when a person makes avoluntary muscle movement and also when one watches the same action. TheUniversity of California, San Diego, group decided to see if EEGs could monitormirror-neuron activity. They studied ten children with high-functioning autismand found they did suppress mu waves when they performed an action, just asnormal children did, but unlike normal children, they did not suppress the muwaves when they observed an action. Their mirror system was deficient.Another study70 was done at UCLA, where children (both normal and with autisticspectrum disorder, ASD) were scanned using fMRI while either observing orimitating emotional facial expressions. Because individuals with ASD often showdeficits in understanding the emotional states of others, it was predicted thatdysfunction in the mirror-neuron system (MNS) should be manifest both when theseindividuals imitate emotional expressions and when they observe emotionsdisplayed by others. This prediction proved correct. Moreover, the degree ofreduction in neural activity correlates with the severity of deficit in socialskills. The less activity, the less socially skilled they were.The two sets of children use different neural systems when imitating facialexpressions. The normal children use a mirroring neural mechanism in the righthemisphere that links with the limbic system via the insula. However, thismirroring mechanism is not engaged in children with ASD, who adopt a differentstrategy. They increase their visual and motor attention, using a pathway thatdoes not go through the limbic system and the insula. The internally feltemotion of the imitated facial expression regulated by the insula is probablynot experienced. These researchers suggest that because both adults and normallydeveloping children show increased MNS activity even when simply observing anemotional expression, this is more proof that the mirroring mechanism mayunderlie the remarkable ability to read others’ emotional states from facialexpressions. The lack of MNS activity in children with ASD strongly supports thetheory that dysfunction in the mirror-neuron system may be at the core of thesocial deficits observed in autism. However, there are many nonsocial attentionskills that are also impaired in autism; they may not be involved with themirror-neuron system.It is currently unknown if animals other than primates have mirror-neuronsystems, but it is being checked out. However, just as Clint Eastwood said, “Aman’s got to know his limitations.”71 We need to understand the limitations ofthe mirror neurons. They do not generate actions.So far we have seen that specific emotions are associated with activity inspecific parts of the brain, and specific physiological responses and specificmovements of the facial muscles result in specific expressions. When we perceiveanother individual exhibiting some type of mood or emotion, we automaticallymimic it, both physiologically and physically, and psychologically to someextent. If there is some abnormality in the brain structure that normallysupports the response, then both the ability to experience the emotion and theability to recognize it in others are affected. We have a mirror system thatunderstands actions and the intentions of actions, and it is also involved withlearning through imitation and emotion recognition. This is Emotion Recognition1—elementary emotion recognition. It seems as though we have built up a goodcase for some type of simulation going on from one person to the next.> > MORE THAN AUTOMATIC?Even though this analysis looks reasonable, there is a wrench in the machinery.People who have Möbius syndrome (congenital facial paralysis due to the absenceor underdevelopment of the cranial nerves that supply the facial muscles) cansuccessfully identify emotions in the faces of others, even though they are notable to physically mimic facial expressions.72 This may not be a problem if ourunderstanding of emotions is via the mirror neurons. They may still fire, eventhough the motor system is not functioning.Another wrench is a recent study on subjects who have a congenital inability tofeel pain (CIP). From facial expressions, these people are able to recognize andrate the pain that others feel just as well as normal controls, even though theythemselves feel none. If, however, they are presented with video clips in theabsence of visible or audible pain-related behavior, CIP patients rate the painas lower, and they have less aversive emotional responses, compared with controlsubjects.One additional interesting finding is that pain judgments in CIP patients arestrongly related to individual differences in emotional empathy, and thiscorrelation is not found in control subjects. The authors of this study suggestthat personal experience of pain is not necessarily required for perceiving andfeeling empathy for another’s pain, although it might be greatly underestimatedwhen there are no emotional cues.73 However, in both cases, the patients withMöbius syndrome and CIP have had long-standing deficits. Their ability torecognize emotions in others may have been consciously learned over the yearsvia a different pathway than that in normal subjects. The authors note that theparents of some CIP patients may resort to miming facial expressions of pain tomake their child understand that a particular stimulus might damage his body.We have learned that watching or hearing other individuals in pain activatessome of the cortical areas known to be involved in the emotional component ofself-pain experience, such as the anterior cingulate cortex and the anteriorinsula. In contrast with the neural mechanism for actually feeling pain, mirrormatching of the emotional aspect of another’s pain might be preserved in CIPpatients. Thus they could detect suffering in others from emotional cues such asfacial pain expressions. At the end of this study, one-third of the patientssaid that they found it difficult to estimate the pain experienced by injuredindividuals without seeing their face or hearing them cry. Scanning thesepatients during these emotional recognition tasks to see what neural areas arebeing used would be interesting, as well as timing their responses compared tothose of normal subjects. Is it a slower conscious pathway that is used, or isit a fast automatic one?Another finding that indicates automatic simulation is not all that is going oncame from a study done by Ursula Hess and Silvie Blairy at the University ofColorado. They found that the occurrence of mimicry did not correlate with theaccuracy in facial emotional recognition.74 This study used facial expressionsthat were not exaggerated but were thought to be more like those one usuallyexperiences. So even though facial mimicry did occur, it did not correlate withthe accurate diagnosis of the emotion being felt by the observed person. Otherstudies have shown that people do not mimic the faces of those with whom theyare in competition75 or of politicians with whom they do not agree.76 Is someinhibitory ability going on? It seems there must be, otherwise we would startcrying in the baby nursery with all the newborns. Is some voluntary cognitioninvolved?> > I THINK, THEREFORE I CAN REAPPRAISEIndeed we can change our emotion and the way we feel by the way we think. Oneway this is accomplished is by reappraisal. This is what happened to ModesteMignon, our fictional example in the last chapter. “In love, what a womanmistakes for disgust is simply seeing clearly.” After a reappraisal of herlover’s character, she goes from love to disgust.77 A car cuts in front of youand zooms down the street. It makes you angry. As your blood pressure starts torise, all of a sudden you remember when you did the same thing on a terrifyingdrive to the emergency room. Next to you was your child whimpering in pain witha dislocated shoulder hanging at his side. Your anger dissipates in a second,your blood pressure drops, and now you feel concern as you realize the hospitalis down the road.Conscious reappraisal of an emotion has been investigated in a brain imagingstudy where participants were presented with photos showing negative butsomewhat ambiguous emotional situations, such as a woman crying outside of achurch. While being scanned, the subjects were then asked to reappraise thesituation in a more positive way. The thought was that reappraisal drawsattention to the emotion one is feeling and requires a voluntary cognitiveassessment. After reappraisal, such as imagining that the woman was sheddingtears of joy after a wedding, versus their initial impression of a funeralscene, the participants reported being less negatively affected. The scanningresults showed that during reappraisal, there was decreased activity in regionsconcerned with emotional processing, and activation in regions that areessential for memory, cognitive control, and self-monitoring.78 Reappraisal canmodulate emotion and simulation. Another interesting finding was that the lefthemisphere was more active in reappraisal. It is theorized that perhaps this maybe because participants reported having “talked” themselves into reappraisalstrategies, and the speech center is in the left hemisphere. Another possibleexplanation is that the left hemisphere is known to be associated withevaluating positive emotions in general.79 People who show a higher restingactivity of the left hemisphere have more resistance to depression, which may bebecause of their cognitive ability to decrease negative emotional processing.> > SUPPRESSIONAnother way simulation can be affected is through suppression, that is,voluntarily not showing any sign of an emotion. Parents often do this when theydon’t laugh at their child’s funny but inappropriate social behavior (pullingoff her dirty diapers in the pool), although it can be difficult. In a review ofresearch on emotional regulation,80 James Gross of Stanford University explainsthat suppression requires one to continually monitor one’s expressions (thatsmile might just pop back up) and correct them (if it does). This is using yourconscious neural circuits, which we have learned are limited, and it takes yourconscious attention away from the social interaction. This leaves you with lessability to process the interaction and can affect your memory of it. This isdifferent from when you reappraise a situation and you no longer actually feelthe emotion, so there is no need to monitor to make sure it doesn’t show.(Pulling off her dirty diapers in the swimming pool actually isn’t funny, it isdisgusting: There is no chance of the smile creeping back.)Suppression and reappraisal have different emotional, physiological, andbehavioral consequences. Suppression does not decrease the emotional experienceof negative behavior; you still have the emotion, you just don’t express it.When the car cuts you off in traffic, you may not scowl at the driver and ramhis bumper, but you are still angry. This is unlike reappraisal, when yourealized the other driver might need the hospital services and you no longerfelt the emotion of anger. However, suppression can decrease the emotionalexperience of positive behavior. Great, that is par for the course. You try tosuppress bad emotions, and not only doesn’t it get rid of them, but now youdon’t feel the good ones as well. Nor does suppression change the physiologicalresponses. You still get all the increased cardiovascular activity. You may behiding your anger, disgust, or fear, but you’re still making your heart workovertime and wearing it out that much sooner. However, reappraisal can changethe physiological response; it can decrease the stress of a stressing situation.If you can change your attitude about a negative stimulus so that it is nolonger negative, then you won’t be borrowing unnecessarily from yourcardiovascular bank account.How does this affect simulation? The interesting consequence of suppressingemotional expressions is that it hides important signals that would otherwise beavailable to the other person in a social situation. She is talking to old stoneface, has no clue how he is feeling, and so can’t respond to him appropriately.And lord knows he isn’t going to respond to her. She has just told him herfunniest story, and he is looking at her as if she should never have graduatedfrom elementary school. She reminds herself to put him on the “do not invite”list, to spare her friends this trying social interaction. And how about oldstone face? His social interactions will be limited, for no doubt she is not theonly one to avoid him.Researchers studying suppression with James Gross made a prediction: Because oneneeds to monitor oneself while suppressing an emotion to be sure the expressionisn’t popping up visibly or vocally, then one may be distracted from actuallyresponding to the other’s emotional cues. This could have negative socialconsequences. If a person is focused on himself, there is less conscious focusavailable for another person. The guy trying to act macho all the time has tosuppress any tender expressions that may be trying to erupt. He has lessavailable brain capacity to be paying attention to anyone interacting with him.Gross and his colleagues also thought that since reappraisal isn’t socognitively taxing, it should have more positive social consequences.They set out to test this theory by asking unacquainted women to watch anupsetting film and then discuss it afterward. One woman in each couple had beenasked to do one of three things. She was to suppress her reactions to the film(as a macho guy may do: “I’m tough, those gory pictures mean nothing to me”), orreappraise (“Those pictures are awful, but it is only a movie, and that isreally ketchup”), or interact naturally with her conversation partner. The otherwoman did not know that any instructions had been given to her partner. Theirphysiological responses were measured during the conversations.Positive expressions of emotion (“That is so great!! I’m so excited for you!”)and emotional responsiveness (“Oh brother, that must drive you crazy; it wouldme!”) are key elements in social support, which decreases stress.81 Theresearchers figured if this social support was absent, then there should be abig difference in the physiological responses to the conversations among thegroup of the uninformed partners. This proved true. The conversation partners ofthe women who had been told to suppress had greater increases of blood pressurethan the women whose partners either acted naturally or had reappraised thefilm.82 Interacting with people who express little positive emotion and who areunresponsive to emotional cues actually increases the cardiovascular activity intheir social partners.80 So if you hang out with someone who suppresses hisexpressions of emotion, it not only makes his blood pressure go up, it makesyours go up too.Things are getting a little more complicated now. It seems that we have gonebeyond a world of emotional contagion, where simulation is a reflexive automaticresponse to facial expressions or other emotional stimuli, and entered into theworld where the conscious brain plays a role. Here you are able to use yourmemory, the knowledge you have gained from past experiences, and what you knowabout the other person as part of your input. This leads us to one moresimulation ability we have, one that is most probably unique. We can simulate anemotion with only abstract input.> > IMAGINATIONI can e-mail you and tell you I cut off part of my finger using a router saw,and without seeing my face or hearing my voice, you can imagine how I felt. Justthe printed words can stimulate you to simulate my emotion. You may wince as youread the description of the accident, get that shiver up your spine. You canalso read a novel about fictitious characters and still be emotionally involvedwith them. Some of the scenes from a Tom Wolfe novel are perfect reminders ofthis. The icehouse scene from The Man in Full was so anxiety provoking I had toput it down for fifteen minutes. So imagining a situation can stimulate one tosimulate an emotion.83 It can be entertaining in itself to watch the facialexpressions and posture of people as they are reading a book. Fear, anger, orpleasure can be deduced. Sherlock Holmes was a master at this, as he would watchWatson read the paper. In fact, words associated with pain cause areas in thebrain that are associated with the subjective component of pain to activate.84Imagination works in physical actions too. Pianists who played music on a silentkeyboard activated the same part of their brain*[Human_split_082.html#filepos1441291] as when they simply imagined playing thesame music.85Imagination allows you to go beyond the data you have at hand. When the Olympicathlete fell and broke her ankle, we see the facial expression of pain, but ourimagination supplies us with all the years of hard work and sacrifice involved,the dashed dreams, the embarrassment, the shame of letting down the team, theknowledge that the injury may affect her future performance, and we feel greatempathy for her. When we see the mugger break his ankle, we also see the facialexpression of pain, but we imagine the person he attacked lying injured andfrightened on the street, and we get angry and no longer feel empathy for hispain, but satisfaction that the perp is getting his due.Imagination is what helps us reappraise a situation. The auditory input may saythat a woman is laughing down the hall, but imagination can put her in a jobinterview with that dweeb in the next office, and you know she is faking it. Sheis not laughing because she is happy. Imagination also allows us to time-travel.We can go into the future and back to the past. An event may be long in thepast, but I can replay it in my imagination from memory. I can simulate theexperience of my former self and reexperience the memory. I can even reappraisethat emotion from my current perspective. I can remember the embarrassment Ifelt at getting a D on a test and feel it again to the point of flushing, andthen I can think with satisfaction that it motivated me to study more, and Iended up with an A. I can remember how I felt driving in a Fiat just before noonon a roundabout in Rome, horns honking, traffic snarled; my anxiety and heartrate can increase, and I can decide never to rent a car there again. I canremember how I felt sipping a Campari while sitting in the sunny Piazza Navonawith my wonderful wife—and decide to go back, but take a taxi to get there.Likewise I can project into the future. I can use my past experience of anemotion and apply it to future circumstances. I can imagine how I would feel,for example, standing at the open aircraft door with a parachute on my back(terror, which I have felt in the past and did not enjoy) and decide I canbypass this adventure. Neural activity associated with feeling an emotion can beseen while just imagining that the emotion will happen in the future. ElizabethPhelps, a neuroscientist at New York University, did a brain imaging study inwhich she told her volunteer subjects they would be viewing a series of shapesand that every time they would see a blue square, they would receive a mildshock. Even though they never were given a shock, every time a blue square waspresented, their amygdala was activated.86 Just the imagination of the shockcaused the circuit to light up. After watching a scary movie, you may hear acreak in your house in the middle of the night and imagine the presence of anintruder. Your heart rate increases, the blood starts pounding in your ears, andyou can get a full-fledged fear reaction. For the rest of her life, Janet Leighsaid she had problems taking a shower after filming the movie Psycho. Herimagination continued to work.Can other animals time-travel? Hold on! We are going to talk about this inchapter 8.Imagination is a deliberate process. It takes simulation beyond the automatic insome circumstances and uses a conscious component. It allows us to plan how wewill act in the future and anticipate how others will act. It saves us wear andtear. I don’t have to go up in the airplane, only then to decide I’m not goingto jump; I can figure that out in my living room. I can also figure out that mydaughter won’t want a gift certificate for a jump either, but my brother would,except he would also want to fly the plane. Imagination allows us to simulateour past emotions and learn from those experiences, and project how others mayfeel or act in the same situation. This ability is critical for social learning.When we do this, however, we are using another one of our many abilities that wetake for granted—the ability to distinguish the difference between others andourselves.> > SELF-AWARENESSObserving actions and emotions in others can activate the same neural areas inour own brains, yet we are able to distinguish between “me” and “you.” How doesthis happen? If the same neural areas are activated when I see you are disgustedas when I am disgusted, how can I tell whether it is you or I? I imagine yourtoupee slipping off as you give an important televised lecture; I can simulateyour embarrassment and feel it myself, but know that it was you I was imaginingand not I. It seems there must be specific neural circuits to distinguishbetween the self and others. Moreover, the self is both physical andpsychological. And yes, there are mechanisms in the brain for distinguishing thephysical me, both from another and from the psychological me.Studies of perspective taking, or imagining yourself in another’s place, havebeen fruitful in separating the neural networks of self and other. Perspectivetaking emerges at about eighteen months in human infants, though not to the sameextent as in an adult. That is when a child will offer you the type of food thatyou indicate with a smile that you like (perhaps broccoli) versus what they likebut which you reacted to with a disgusted face (cookies).87 We are notnecessarily good at perspective taking, however, nor do we always do it. I wouldfind the choice of broccoli distinctly odd myself, and I might overrule theevidence of your facial expression in favor of my much more sensible preference,and give you the cookie anyway. Obvious examples are all those really badChristmas presents that you have received. “Why would anyone in his right mindthink I wanted or would like this?” must run through thousands of brains onChristmas morning behind forced (conscious) smiles. At least now you know youcan check the lateral eyebrows, to see if they have depressed, to spot thosefakers.People tend to think that others know and believe what they know and believe88and also tend to overestimate the knowledge of others.89 This is most likelywhat is happening when you start talking about your theory of recursion inlinguistics to normal people and they get that dazed look on their faces. You’veassumed they’d be interested. It seems our default mode in regard to others isbiased toward our own perspective. That is why it can be so difficult to talk topeople who are specialists in fields you have no clue about. They assume youknow much of what they themselves know. “Ah, run that hedge fund deal by meagain?” If you are asked how another would feel in a situation involving bodilyneeds, such as hunger, fatigue, or thirst, your prediction is largely based onhow you would feel. I assume when other people feel hungry, they feel the samething I do—that aching, gnawing feeling in the stomach. This apparently is nottrue. I found this out in a discussion with some friends: Some feel jittery,some get headaches, some get cranky, some have no feelings in their gut at all.This self-centered perception can lead to errors in social judgment other thanbringing up recursion at cocktail parties. “He should have called me by now. Iwould have called him. He must not care about me.” But as University of Chicagopsychologist Jean Decety and University of Washington psychologist PhilipJackson point out, it goes well with simulation theory, which states that weunderstand and predict the behavior and mental states of others by using our ownmental resources. By imagining we were in their situation, we use our ownknowledge as our default base to understand others.26 However, for socialsuccess, we need to be able to separate ourselves from the other. (He didn’tcall because he forgot his cell phone, he’s on a business trip in China, thetime difference is crazy, and he is exhausted.) Decety and colleagues emphasizethat one needs mental flexibility to flip back and forth between perspectives:We need to be able to inhibit our own perspective to take the other’sperspective. Regulation (or inhibition) of our own perspective is what allowsflexibility to take the other’s perspective. It has been suggested that errorsin assessing another’s perspective are a failure of suppressing one’s own,90which is why your husband gave you a new barbecue instead of jewelry for yourbirthday, and why you gave him the beautiful blue dress shirt instead of theXVR800 series PKJ super-beyond-reason subwoofer. This ability to regulategradually develops in children and is not fully apparent until about age four.The cognitive control involved has been linked to the development of theory ofmind, which emerges at the same age, as well as to the maturation of theprefrontal cortex. So what is going on in the brain when we switch from our ownperspective to another’s?One way to figure this out is to see which areas are activated in taking one’sown perspective, and which are activated in taking another’s perspective. Anycommonly activated areas are subtracted. What is left activated in eithersituation is what is unique to that perspective. Perrine Ruby and Decety havedone a series of neural imaging studies while subjects take either their ownperspective or another’s on tasks in the motor domain (imaging using a shovel orrazor), the conceptual domain (medical students imaging what a layperson wouldsay about various statements, such as “There are more births when the moon isfull,” versus what they would say), and the emotional domain (imaging eitheryourself or your mother talking about someone and then realizing that the personis right behind you).91, 92, 93 They have found that, apart from the sharedneural network between self and other, when one takes another’s perspective,there is significant activation in the right inferior parietal cortex and theventromedial prefrontal cortex, which includes the frontopolar cortex and thegyrus rectus. Other studies have had similar results. The somatosensory cortexis activated only when one takes one’s own perspective.The junction of the right inferior parietal cortex with the posterior temporalcortex plays a critical role in the distinction between one’s own actions andanother’s. Called the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), it is a busy place,integrating input from many different parts of the brain, including the lateraland posterior thalamus; the visual, auditory, somes-thetic and limbic areas; andreciprocal connections with the prefrontal cortex and the temporal lobes.Various other studies have thrown in bits of evidence that this area plays apart in differentiating self from other. Studies of the out-of-body experience(OBE), a third-person perspective of oneself, have been fruitful.One interesting case is that of a woman who was being evaluated for epilepsytreatment at the University Hospital of Geneva. Her physicians were trying tolocate the focus of her seizures but were unable to do so with brain imaging.The next step was to do surgery, but they needed to locate the focus first.Under local anesthesia (the brain itself feels no pain), subdural electrodeswere implanted to record seizures, and focal electrical stimulation was used toidentify the cortical locus of the seizures. With focal electrical stimulationof the brain’s right angular gyrus (located in the parietal lobe), she hadrepeated out-of-body experiences. With stimulation to one particular area, thepatient reported, “I see myself lying in bed, from above, but I only see my legsand lower trunk.”94Since then, Olaf Blanke and Shahar Arzy95 have done a review of all suchphenomena, collating evidence from neurology, cognitive neuroscience, andneuroimaging. They suggest that OBEs are related to a failure to integratemultisensory information from one’s own body at the temporoparietal junction.They speculate that this failure at the TPJ leads to disruption of what the selfexperiences and thinks. This can cause illusions of reduplication,self-location, perspective, and agency that are experienced as an OBE. Anotherparticular area along the TPJ is involved specifically in reasoning about thecontents of another person’s mind,96 an ability that requires differentiatingself from other.The other part of the brain that is active when taking another’s perspective isthe ventral prefrontal cortex, also called the frontal polar (or frontopola)cortex. Damage to this region in childhood can result in impairedperspective-taking ability.97 This area is thought to be the source of theinhibition that allows one to move from self-perspective to other perspective.Damasio’s group has given moral tests to adults who have had injuries to thisarea in childhood. Their answers were excessively egocentric, as was theirbehavior. They exhibited a lack of self-perspective inhibition and did not takethe other’s perspective. People who acquire these types of lesions as adults(for example, Phineas Gage), rather than as children, can compensate for thembetter. This suggests that the neural systems that had been impaired at an earlyage were critical for the acquisition of social knowledge.98Additional studies have shown that the somatosensory cortex, the part of thebrain with specific areas that correlate with sensation to specific parts of thebody, is activated when a situation is simulated from one’s own perspective.Subjects were asked to view pictures of hands or feet in neutral or painfulpositions and imagine the pain from either their own or another’s perspective.Both perspectives had activation in the emotional affective pain area, but onlythe subjects taking a personal perspective had activation of their somatosensorycortex. They also had higher pain ratings and faster response times, andactivated the pain pathways to a greater extent.*[Human_split_083.html#filepos1441486]99 Ruby and Decety speculate that theactivation of the somatosensory cortex with the personal perspective contributesto separating the two perspectives: “If I feel it, it is me (I feel, so I am),it cannot be the other.”93Interestingly, the regions that were active in third-person perspective takingwere the same regions that are active in various theory-of-mind tasks.†[Human_split_084.html#filepos1441986] If we are consciously taking the other’sperspective and are assuming the other is like us, then simulating how we wouldfeel in their situation will most likely lead to an accurate appraisal of theother’s state. However, if we are taking the perspective of a person who is verydifferent from us, then simulating our own state will be less useful. Does ourbrain use different substrates when we assume that the other is like us and whenwe think he is different? A new study has shown this to be so.100 When we takethe perspective of a similar person, a region of the ventral medial prefrontalcortex (mPFC) linked to self-referential thought is activated, whereasmentalizing about a dissimilar other engages a more dorsal subregion of themPFC.The overlapping neural activations between judgments of self and similar otherstake us back to the simulation theory of social cognition, according to which weuse knowledge about ourselves to infer the mental states of others. This use ofa different substrate to think about unlike others has interesting implications,especially as to how we think about in-group and out-group individuals. When wethink about people in our own group, we assume they are like us, and we predicttheir behavior from simulating what we would do or feel in the same situation.This may explain Sam and Pearl Oliner’s finding that 52 percent of the rescuersof Jews during the Holocost were primarily motivated by “expressing andstrengthening their affiliations with their social groups.” However, whenthinking of a person in the out-group, a process different from simulation mayoccur. Sociological studies have shown people think that unlike others feelneither the same emotions nor the same depth of emotion,101 and they willproject their own goals and preferences on similar others but less so ondissimilar ones.102 This perhaps can explain the dehumanizing that can occursuch as between prison guards and prisoners, between neighboring countries, andbetween religious groups. Although this distinguishing between groups can be thesource of inhumane treatment, it can also be helpful if you understand how thebrain works. People do differ. Not everyone is like you. Assuming they are cancause problems. Popular psychology literature about the differences between thesexes, such as Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus, puts men and women intwo different groups. This actually may be helpful for our anxious womanawaiting a phone call. Perhaps if she realized that men’s and women’s behaviorsdiffer in some areas, then she would not try to predict his behavior from herperspective.> > CAN ANIMALS TAKE ANOTHER’S PERSPECTIVE?Is perspective taking uniquely human? Are we the only animals that can standback and look at the world through another’s eyes? Such an ability impliesself-awareness, which we are also going to talk more about in relation to otheranimals in chapter 8. This has been a controversial question, but a new way ofstudying the question (a new perspective) is indicating that primates are ableto do this in certain situations. Brian Hare and colleagues at the Max PlanckInstitute in Leipzig have shown that chimpanzees can take the visual perspectiveof another when in competition for food.*[Human_split_085.html#filepos1442261]103 It may be that previous studies lookingfor theory-of-mind capacities in primates using helping tasks were looking inthe wrong place. As we have learned before, chimpanzees perform most skillfullyin competitive cognitive tasks. The researchers took advantage of thischaracteristic and pitted the chimps against a human (let’s call him Sam) whomoved prized food items out of the chimps’ reach when they attempted to grabthem. The chimps could approach Sam from behind an opaque barrier or couldapproach from a direction in which Sam was either looking or not looking. Thechimpanzees spontaneously avoided food Sam was watching, as indicated by gazedirection. Instead they approached food he was not watching, even when most ofhis body was oriented toward and was within reach of the food. Also, the chimpspreferred to approach food behind opaque barriers while refraining fromapproaching it from behind transparent barriers. When the chimps initiallywalked away from the food, if Sam was able to see them, they always used anindirect route before approaching behind the barrier. However, if the barriersprevented Sam from seeing them move away from the food, or if there was nohidden route back to the food, the chimps did not use indirect routes todistance themselves. The researchers point out that this indirect approachbehavior is striking, because it suggests the possibility that the subjects notonly understood that it was important to be hidden from their competitor’s viewwhile approaching contested food, but that they also understood that in somecases it was useful to hide their attempt to hide.The chimps were able to take another’s visual perspective, understand what theother could see, and actively manipulate the situation in a competitiveenvironment. This study also provides some of the strongest evidence thatchimpanzees are capable of intentional deception, at least where food isconcerned in a competitive situation. Intentional deception is manipulating whatanother believes to be true. However, as we have seen in a previous chapter,chimps are unable to solve the false-belief task that children are able to do atthe age of four. Understanding what others see is not the same as being able tounderstand or manipulate their psychological state, but these findings do leadinevitably to more questions. They up the ante on the abilities of chimps inregard to theory of mind. Hare suggests that we also need to determine whetherchimps understand what others hear. Do they avoid making loud noises, as hasbeen observed in the wild,104, 105, 106 to intentionally manipulate a situation,and do they make false cries to intentionally deceive others? It is unclear ifchimps can take another’s psychological perspective, but there are indicationsthat they can, to some degree. Lisa Parr’s research that showed that chimpscould match the emotion shown in a video scene, such as that of a chimpreceiving an injection, with a photograph of a equivalent emotional facialexpression indicates an emotional awareness that may be a precursor to our moreadvanced psychological perspective-taking ability.107After these results were obtained, another research group decided to use thecompetitive task situation to test rhesus monkeys to see if they understood thatseeing leads to knowing. All previous laboratory testing of monkeys for TOMtasks has had negative results. These researchers also set up a situation inwhich the monkeys would be in competition with an experimenter for food. Firstthey tested whether monkeys took into account the direction of an experimenter’sgaze when trying to steal food. They did—they stole it from an experimenterwhose back was turned or whose head was averted. With even more discernment,they stole it from one who had averted his eyes but not turned his head, or fromone whose eyes were covered but not from one whose mouth was covered.108They then wondered if a monkey would know that a researcher who hasn’t seenwhere food was wouldn’t know where it was. In this experiment, there were twoplatforms with a grape on each. The monkey could see both grapes. Theexperimenter put the grapes on the platforms and then sat down behind a barrierso he could no longer see them. The platforms were rigged so that one would tiltand the grape would roll down a ramp but the experimenter could not see thishappen. The monkeys would immediately grab that grape, but not the one whoseposition the experimenter knew about. When they changed the situation so thatthe experimenter could still see both grapes, the monkeys approached eithergrape randomly. Their results indicated that rhesus monkeys do understand thatseeing leads to knowing. The monkeys understood what the experimenter could seeand what he could or could not know as a result of what he could see. For thefirst time, researchers believe that rhesus monkeys do have some capacity fortheory-of-mind reasoning, and it seems to be most available in competitivesituations.109Another social animal is man’s best friend, the dog. Scientists have not spentmuch time studying dogs, except for Darwin, of course. Recently, however, dogshave surpassed Rodney Dangerfield and have been getting some respect. The studyof dogs has been hindered by the view they are an “artificial” species.Realizing that dogs have adapted to their niche (living as domesticated animals)for at least the last 15,000 years or so (although DNA evidence suggests as farback as 100,000 years), as have other “natural” species adapted to theirparticular niche, makes comparative investigations into their social cognitionmore fruitful.110 Dogs have some humanlike social skills chimps do not have111and have coevolved with humans for thousands of years. These social skills arenot learned but are innate, and are different from those of their ancestral wolfrelatives. Dogs understand what humans see and will drop a returned ball infront of a human, not to his back if he has turned around. Dogs will beg forfood from humans whose head and eyes are visible, rather than someone whose headis covered by a bucket, something that chimps do not spontaneously do. Dogs willnot approach forbidden food when they are behind a barrier and the food is infront of a window that a human can see through. They understand that the humancan see the food, even though they can’t see the human. Dogs do not needcompetition to cooperate. Dogs will find hidden food that humans are pointingto, even if the human is walking away from the food. Chimps themselves do notpoint, nor do they understand the intention of it as dogs do. This may bebecause of the lack of cooperation in chimps.What effects has domestication brought about? In 1959, Dr. Dmitry Belyaev begandomesticating foxes in Siberia, selecting for only a single criterion: whetherthey exhibited fearless and nonaggressive behavior toward humans. In otherwords, he selected for inhibition of fear and aggression. By-products of thisselection process have included many morphological variations that are seen indomestic dogs, such as floppy ears, upturned tail, and piebald colorations likethat in border collies. There are also behavioral changes, including prolongedreproductive season, and physiological changes, interestingly including higherserotonin levels in the female (known to decrease some types of aggressivebehavior) and altered sex hormone levels, resulting in bigger litters. Thelevels of many of the chemicals in the brain that regulate stress and aggressivebehavior have been altered.112 Correlating Belyaev’s work with the domesticationof the dog, it has been suggested that the social skills of dogs may havedeveloped as a by-product, and first appeared after systems mediating theinhibition of fear and aggression developed. Interestingly, this has led to theproposition that the social behavior of great apes is constrained by theirtemperament—their inability to cooperate and their intense competitiveness,which are now becoming more recognized.Perhaps the human temperament might be necessary for the evolution of morecomplex forms of social cognition. Perhaps it is the ability to inhibitself-perspective that is deficient in other nonhuman primates and hasconstrained their cooperation. Hare and Tomasello suggest that the evolution ofthe human temperament might have preceded the evolution of our more complexforms of social cognition. It would have done us no good to have a highlysophisticated ability to read the minds of others if we didn’t share incooperative goals. They flirt with a hypothesis that an important first step inthe evolution of modern human societies was a kind of self-domestication thatselected for systems that controlled emotional reactivity. According to thisidea, individuals in a group would either ostracize or kill overaggressive ordespotic others.111 This is an interesting proposition, and when considered withthe proposition of multilevel group selection, it could result in a social groupthat is cooperative but willing to punish cheaters.These studies on animal perspective taking are indicating that we do sharesocial cognitive abilities with other primates and other social animals. Thisshould come as no surprise. What is surprising is the extent of our sociability.We share the capacity for emotional contagion, mimicry, perspective taking, andlimitations on self-awareness to some degree. We share mirror-neuron systems;however, ours have greater capability and are more extensive. We can voluntarilyimitate intricate movements, an ability that does not exist in other primates.> > CONCLUSIONPeople are capable of voluntarily, deliberately switching from one abstractperspective to another with easy flexibility. We can manipulate what emotions weare simulating by imagination alone. Different perspectives can lead tosimulating different emotions. This can be done without the presence of anyimmediately available physical stimulus. We can transfer emotional knowledgewith abstract tools, such as language or music, through books, songs, e-mails,and conversations. We can listen to George Gershwin’s An American in Paris andfeel excitement and the nostalgia of homesickness. We can feel sadness as weread Hugo’s Les Misérables, and laugh uncontrollably as we read about Dave Barryturning forty. This ability allows us to learn about the world without having toexperience it all firsthand ourselves. We don’t have to learn things the hardway. I can tell you how an audience reacted to a joke last night and you canlearn whether that joke is a good one to use (you do not have to experience theembarrassing silence or snickers). You can tell your friend that taking the busfrom El Paso to Tierra del Fuego was an interesting but grueling trip, andrecommend Tahiti for his honeymoon instead: Your friend can learn from yourexperience and save his marriage. These abilities to simulate emotions fromlanguage and imagination, to alter our simulations by using perspective, and toproject ourselves into the future and past enrich our social world and make oursimulations more powerful and complex than those of other species."},{"pageContent":"PART 3 [Human_split_003.html#filepos3971]"},{"pageContent":"THE GLORY OF BEING HUMAN [Human_split_003.html#filepos3971]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 [Human_split_003.html#filepos4268]"},{"pageContent":"WHAT’S UP WITH THE ARTS?

ARE HUMANS THE ONLY artists? Since we are productsof natural selection, what possible evolutionary advantage did they bestow onus? Would a lion pause and think twice about eating your ancestor if he had donea quick little rendition of “Shuffle Off to Buffalo” in a pair of cobra skinshoes with coconut shell taps? Would a neighboring tribe’s army crawling throughthe brush exclaim to themselves upon seeing your camp, “Look at howaesthetically placed those logs are! And the fire pit is simply spectacular!What are we thinking? We could not possibly consider knocking out these creativepeople and taking their leg o’ impala roasting on the spit!”Or maybe art is like the peacock’s tail. “Bruno makes the cutest carvinginstruments out of bones. All the other guys are just a bunch of Neanderthals,but Bruno, he is an artist. I think I’ll mate with him.”Or is it all about status? “Bruno has the biggest knife collection of anyone. Infact he has a knife made by Gormox. I know, I know, Gormox’s knives don’t cutanything, and they are misshapen, but there are very few of them around!”Or perhaps Bruno is curling up for his afternoon siesta when he catches aglimpse out of the corner of his eye of a snake peeking out at him. He remembersthe bedtime story his father had told him about some guy who had seen apoisonous snake, and he had feigned sleep, and just as the snake was…he grabbedit and slammed it against the ground. As he skinned it with his cute knife andthought about some new taps, he considered, “Hmmmm. Maybe those stories weren’tjust to put me to sleep after all.”Or was he the first charming Frenchman? “Oh, my petite, slither with me throughthis cave just around the corner in Lascaux and let me show you my etchings.” Orwas art a gift to the gods? “If I can get this dance down right, we will be sureto have plenty of good hunting and great weather. I better not screw up and hipwhen I should hop. That will wreck everything.”And what about those intoxicating rhythms? Did the tribe that danced togetherbond better than the tribe who were out of sync? Were they better able tocoordinate their hunting? Did the beat of drums work as an aphrodisiac? WasPavarotti any different from a songbird attracting a mate? Is Mick Jaggeranother example of a peacock’s tail, or is there more to the story? Are the artsuniquely human?Explaining the arts is a conundrum. A superficial consideration would place thearts in the position of frosting on the cake. After everything else is accountedfor, then we can think about art. After we create the functional, is theaesthetic merely the extra? “I’ve built a chair and now I can sit down. Hmmm, itsure looks boring, maybe I should add a pillow for a splash of color.” After therent, groceries, clothes, gas, car, insurance, utilities, retirement account,and taxes are taken care of, if there is any left over, then maybe you canconsider a movie, a concert, painting, dance lessons, or a theatricalproduction. But is that really their place? Perhaps the arts are more important.Maybe they aren’t the frosting on the cake; maybe they are the baking soda, orthe sugar. Maybe they are so much a part of us that once again we take them forgranted. Perhaps the aesthetic quality of things is more basic to oursensibilities than we realize, and we ignore it at our peril. Does it belong tothe great unconscious part of our brain we are learning more and more about toour amazement? When did art evolve? Is there any evidence of it in other animalsor our ancestors? Was it necessary for big brains to develop first for art toappear, or did it contribute to their development?Obviously many forms of art are unique to humans. Gorillas don’t play the sax,chimps don’t write plays. Can other animals appreciate art? Will a chimp gaze atthe sunset or be enraptured by Rachmaninoff? Does your dog dig the Stones? Dowe, as humans need art? Does it help develop our brains? Are piano lessons justas important as history class? Should we be spending more money on ourchildren’s art education? Should we consider it not frosting, the last thing wespend money on, but a baseline budget item?Many of these questions are just beginning to be addressed. We will start with alook at what art is. Then we’ll see what is known of the beginning of art andwhat it can tell us about the brains that created it. We’ll see what theevolutionary psychologists have to say, and then see what recent neuroimagingstudies have revealed.> > WHAT IS ART, ANYWAY?Can we even define art? One of art’s mysteries is brought to our attention bythe oft-said phrase “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder”—or the ear. We canboth go to an art gallery, and one of us may have been enraptured while theother of us thinks we’ve seen a hack job. We may have heard the mumbled comment,“And she calls this art? I call it garbage.” We can go to a concert, and one ofus will think the music sublime, and the other may be on edge and have to get upand leave. One of us may walk into a room and feel warm and relaxed and find itbeautiful, while the other may find it tedious and boring, whispering, “Histaste is all in his mouth!” We know instantly whether we like a painting or not.It “appeals” to us or it doesn’t.Art is one of those human universals. All cultures have some form of it, whetherit is painting, dance, story, song, or other forms. We can look at a painting orlisten to a symphony or watch a dance recital and understand consciously howmuch time and effort went into the production, how much practice and educationwere (or perhaps were not) involved, and appreciate it, but that does not meanwe like it. How can we define something about which we have no consensus? On theother hand, don’t we all gaze up at a starry desert sky and think it isbeautiful? Don’t we all find a babbling brook lovely?Ellen Dissanayake, an affiliate professor in the school of music at theUniversity of Washington, points out, “The present-day Western concept of art isa mess.”1 She comments that our notion of art is peculiar to our place and time,and modern aesthetics comes from philosophers who had no knowledge ofprehistoric art, or of the widespread presence of art around the world in itsmany forms, or that we had evolved biologically. Steven Pinker, who haspenetrating ideas on just about everything, reminds us that the arts engage notonly the psychology of aesthetics but also the psychology of status. In order tounderstand the arts the two need to be separated, and this is what hasn’t beendone throughout many of the long windbag discussions about art in the past. Thepsychology of status plays a major role in what is considered Art. Just like anexpensive house and a Lamborghini, an original Picasso on the wall has noutilitarian value but indicates that you have money to burn. Pinker says,“Thorstein Veblen’s and Quentin Bell’s analyses of taste and fashion, in whichan elite’s conspicuous displays of consumption, leisure, and outrage areemulated by the rabble, sending the elite off in search of new inimitabledisplays, nicely explain the otherwise inexplicable oddities of the arts.”2Once the fashion, architecture, music, etc., is accepted by the seething masses,it is no longer elite and may no longer be considered art with a capital A.Thus, it is impossible to define art if both aspects of its psychology are leftentwined, because the accepted definition is constantly changing. However, if wecan separate the two, then we can deal with the aesthetic aspect of art. BothPinker and Dissanayake include in their category of art the common and not justthe rarefied products. Your kitchen plates can be as aesthetically pleasing toyou as a painting. Aesthetics has little to do with the monetary value of art.In the world of Art, however, it may be beautiful, but if it is a copy, it isworthless.Pinker goes on to point out that the psychological response to the status aspectof Art is a forbidden topic among art academicians and intellectuals. To them,it is OK to be ignorant of the sciences and math, even though such knowledgewould be beneficial to health choices. However, to prefer Wayne Newton toMozart, or to be ignorant of some obscure reference, is as shocking as wearingyour boxers (only) to a black-tie dinner. Your choice in art, your personalpreference and knowledge about a leisure time activity, is used by another tomake a value judgment about your character. The same does not usually happen ina discussion of hammers or chromosomes. How status became enmeshed in art is onequestion, and why we find something aesthetically pleasing is another.> > BEAUTY AND ARTThere are those who will argue that beauty has nothing to do with art. It mustbe because they have not separated the two different psychological responses.You don’t hear, “That is the ugliest painting I’ve ever seen. Let’s put it inthe dining room.” But while looking at the same awful thing in the gallery, youmay hear, “This is Blah Blah’s latest painting, and his last one was purchasedby the Getty. I think I’ll get this for our New York apartment.” CamiloCela-Conde, director of the Laboratory of Human Systematics and professor at theUniversity of Islas Baleares, Spain, quotes the philosopher Oswald Hanfling assaying, “People who visit galleries, read poetry and so on, do it, after all,looking for beauty.”3 Symphony orchestras don’t survive by having this response:“It says here in the Sunday review that this symphony is the most dissonant andjarring piece of music that the critic has ever heard, and he likens it tofingernails scratching on a blackboard. Well that sounds great! Let’s go.” Weare going to be interested in finding out if there is a universal sense ofaesthetics or beauty. Pinker asks: “What is it about the mind that lets peopletake pleasure in shapes and colors and sounds and jokes and stories and myths?”2One dictionary definition of art is: “Human effort to imitate, supplement,alter, or counteract the work of nature. The conscious production or arrangementof sounds, colors, forms, or other elements in a manner that affects the senseof beauty, specifically the production of the beautiful in a graphic or plasticmedium.”4 Nancy Aiken of Ohio University breaks art down into four components: 1. the artist who makes the work 2. the work itself 3. the observer of the work, and 4. the value the observer places on the work.5The American Heritage College Dictionary gives four definitions of aesthetics.We are going to consider them one by one. The first definition is: “The branchof philosophy that deals with the nature and expression of beauty, as in thefine arts. In Kantian philosophy, the branch of metaphysics concerned with thelaws of perception.” We’ve got philosophers talking about what is beautiful, andthey have been talking for centuries. The philosophical discussion starts withPlato’s theory that beauty is independent of the observer (although it needs anobserver). If something is beautiful, it just is; no one’s opinions arenecessary. A couple of millennia later, we have Kant, who was concerned with theaesthetic value to the perceiver: Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Beautyis then a judgment.Neuroscience can at least study Kant’s theories about perception and aestheticjudgments.6 So we have the stimulus (the object or artist or piece of music) andthe sensual perception of the stimulus. Next comes our emotional response to theperception of the stimulus, which brings us to the second definition ofaesthetics: “The study of the psychological responses to beauty and artisticexperiences.”The study of psychological responses to beauty has actually been rather sparse.Research in aesthetics has suffered the same fate as research into emotion. Thebehaviorists and the cognitivists have neglected it, and surprisingly, it hasalso been neglected by the more recent emotion theorists.7 It has been suggestedthat this neglect has been due to a failure to identify aesthetics as eithercognition or an emotion, or even as both: It is an orphan child in the land ofpsychology. Aesthetics is a special class of experience, neither a type ofresponse nor an emotion, but a modus operandi of “knowing about” the world. Itis sensation with an attached positive or negative evaluation. Does this soundfamiliar? It is like the approach–don’t approach information given to the brainbefore it had language. In fact, I recently heard this statement: “I like thatkitchen, but I can’t tell you why. I guess you have to break it down and examineits components to figure it out.”* [Human_split_086.html#filepos1442482] Afterthe emotional reaction, we get a judgment tempered by either an unconscious(hardwired) or conscious (conditioned by culture, upbringing, education, andinclination) idea of whether we think the input is beautiful.And that takes us to the third definition of aesthetics: “A conception of whatis artistically valid or beautiful.” Donald Norman of Northwestern Universitysuggests that there are three separate levels of beauty. The surface beauty,which is the immediate visceral reaction, is biologically determined and isconsistent in people throughout the world. Then there is beauty in operation orbehavior (how that beamer handles on the autobahn). Last is the beauty in depth,in meaning, and implication, which Norman calls reflective. Reflective beauty isconscious and is influenced by the individual’s culture, education, memory, andexperience—everything that goes into you as a person.8 Thus there are twodifferent types of aesthetic judgment, one visceral and automatic, the otherconscious and contemplative.And finally we arrive at the fourth definition of aesthetics: “An artisticallybeautiful or pleasing appearance.” Nicholas Humphrey†[Human_split_087.html#filepos1442667] tackles the question of beauty from theperceptual end by attempting to define the particular perceptual quality thatthings of beauty have in common. He proceeds by searching for the essence ofbeauty in the relations formed between the perceived elements. We can listen toa melody and think it is beautiful, but we don’t think a B-flat is beautiful byitself, and an A is beautiful, and so on. It is the combination, the relationsamong the different notes, that are beautiful. But this doesn’t really help usout all that much. Sure, we can say the relation is beautiful, but whatrelations are important? Why are they important? Why isn’t an endless trill ofB-flat and A beautiful, whereas a quick little flourish of it in the right spotis?Humphrey calls on the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins. Hopkins defined beauty aslikeness tempered with difference. Humphrey goes on to build a hypothesis that“aesthetic preferences stem from a predisposition among animals and men to seekout experiences through which they may learn to classify the objects in theworld about them. Beautiful ‘structures’ in nature or in art are those whichfacilitate the task of classification by presenting evidence of the ‘taxonomic’relations between things in a way which is informative and easy to grasp.”9Humphrey is hinting that our ability to make aesthetic judgments is fundamentalto learning.In the nineteenth century, Gerard Manley Hopkins didn’t have neuroscience tohelp him out, nor did Plato in his day. But things have changed and gotten moreinteresting. Psychologists Rolf Reber, Norbert Schwarz, and Piotr Winkielman,from the University of Bergen, Norway, the University of Michigan, and theUniversity of California, San Diego, respectively, tackle the question of beautythrough neural processing. They propose that beauty, as defined by aestheticpleasure, is a function of the perceiver’s processing dynamics. The morefluently perceivers can mentally process an object, the more positive theiraesthetic response. This theory has four assumptions: 1. Some objects are processed more easily than others because they contain certain features the brain is hardwired to process, which it does quickly, such as symmetry. (These are features we will run into later.) But the ease of processing can also be influenced by perceptual or conceptual priming. 2. When we perceive something we process easily, we get a positive feeling. 3. This positive feeling contributes to our value judgment as to whether something is pleasing or not, unless we question the informational value of this input. 4. The impact of the fluency is moderated by your expectations or what you attribute it to. If you go shopping at Nordstrom and enjoy the piano playing while you are shopping, you are in a positive mood. Then, when you see a red purse you like, you are more likely to buy it because of this positive mood. However, before we enter the store, I might tell you, “Don’t let the piano playing go to your head. They just do that to put you in a good mood so you’ll buy more.” Then when you see that purse, you will be more conscious about deciding whether you like it or not.However, even though there are hardwired preferences due to ease of processing,different experiences can increase processing fluency in novel areas, and newneural connections can be made, all of which will affect aesthetic judgment.10Your processing fluency can be enhanced by experience. The first time you see anew architectural style, you may not like it, but after you have seen it severaltimes, it begins to “grow on you.” The beauty of this theory is that it canaccount for many different findings that have been puzzling. I will return to ita bit later.Hopkins broke down the aesthetic judgment of a “beautiful” object into itsperceptual and its visual or auditory components, then analyzed what he thoughtwere factors contributing toward making his judgment, implying that these wouldbe universal rules. Reber, Schwarz, and Winkielman assume there are some thingsthat are innately easy to process. Norman thinks that the immediate reaction weget to surface beauty is biologically determined. Can science tell us whetherthere are in fact universal guidelines for aesthetic preferences that arehardwired in our brains?> > Are There Universal Components to Aesthetic Judgments?Do we share some universal preferences for certain components of aestheticpreference with other animals? If so, when did these preferences get channeledinto the actual production of art? Can the past help us? Can we pinpoint whenart first appeared? I won’t keep you in suspense. That answer is no. The pointat which our ancestors first perceived a stimulus and made a value judgment thatit was beautiful is probably always going to be unknown to us. When did thefirst primate look up at the sunset and find it magnificent? Did this happenbefore we diverged from our common ancestor or afterward? Is there any evidencechimpanzees have aesthetic sensibilities? Chimpanzees will have an emotionalreaction to some natural phenomena. Jane Goodall describes a waterfall in GombeNational Park where she has observed chimps on several different occasions.After they arrive there, they do a wild dance, which involves rhythmicallyswaying from foot to foot, and then they sit and watch the water as it falls.11What is going on in the chimpanzees’ brains is unknown. Are they excited, justas a child is excited to go to the beach? Do they feel the emotion of awe? Arethey making an aesthetic judgment? (“I like this” does not necessarily translateto “I think this is beautiful.”) Can they even make aesthetic judgments?> > Artistic Chimps?Some chimpanzees, especially when young, when given pencils or paints havebecome engrossed in using them, to the point of ignoring favorite foods andturning their backs on other chimps while working on a design. Chimps familiarwith drawing have begged for supplies when they see their caretaker inpossession of them and have thrown tantrums when stopped while painting. Oneuntamed chimp named Alpha refused to draw with a pointed stick and would rejectpencils with dull points. Obviously, some chimps like to draw and are a bitfussy about the results. Chimps also stayed within the boundaries of theirpaper, and one chimp would mark the corners before starting.12 A series of threepaintings by a male chimp named Congo recently sold at auction for twelvethousand pounds.13Desmond Morris, who studied Congo primarily, as well as the works of otherprimate drawers and painters, could identify six common principles in bothchimpanzee and human art. It was a self-rewarding activity, there wascompositional control, there were variations in line and in theme, there wasoptimum heterogeneity and universal imagery.12 Just as the art of children anduntrained human adults across cultures is very similar in its imagery andappearance, the chimpanzee drawings and paintings also were similar to eachother. Morris attributes universal imagery in human art partly to similaritiesin muscular movements of the body and to the constraints of the visual system.As an artist is trained, he gains more control over his musculature, and withpractice, Morris suggests, a third influence becomes more pronounced—thepsychological factor.However, Congo was not a supreme colorist, as his paintings may suggest. If leftalone with the paints, he would mix them all together until he had made brownand then would use that. He was handed brushes that had been preloaded withpaint, and when that color was used up, he was handed another color. In orderthat the researchers might study the calligraphy of the strokes, one color wasallowed to dry before another color was given to him, so that the colors andstrokes would not blend. If left to his own devices, he would not allow onecolor to dry but would slap on the next, and the colors and strokes would becomemuddy. Although he would signal when he was done with a drawing, he wouldfrequently draw on top of it if it was given to him at another time. Aftercompleting a drawing or painting, he was no longer interested in it. He wouldn’tjust look at it for pleasure. The drawing and painting sessions were very short,never lasting more than a few minutes per picture, presenting the question ofwhether the end of the picture was an aesthetic judgment or simply the end ofhis attention span, especially since he would draw on top of it at a differentsession. Interestingly, he would try various techniques, such as urinating on apainting and swishing the urine around and later using dripped water on apainting for the same effect. He tried using his grooming brush and fingernailson the paints also. Novelty was important. None of the chimpanzees that Morrisstudied created a recognizable pictorial image.In discussing compositional control, Morris cites a study done by ProfessorBernhard Rensch in Germany, who wondered if animals had pattern preferences. Hetested four inquisitive species: two monkey species, capuchin monkeys (Cebus)and guenon monkeys (Ceropithecus), and two bird species, jackdaws and crows. Hepresented a series of cards with either regular rhythmic patterns or irregularmarkings.After several hundred tests, Rensch found that all four species would pick upthe regular patterns more frequently. He concluded: “When choosing betweendifferent black patterns on white cardboards the monkey preferred geometrical,i.e. more regular patterns, to irregular ones. It is very probable that thesteadiness of the course of a line, the radial or bilateral symmetry andrepetition of equal components in a pattern (rhythm) were decisive for thepreference…. Both species of birds preferred the more regular, more symmetricalor rhythmical patterns. In most cases the percentage of preference wasstatistically significant. Probably this preference is caused by the better‘complexibility,’ i.e. the easier comprehensibility of symmetrical andrhythmical repetitions of the same components (Rekurrenzlust).”*[Human_split_088.html#filepos1443184] Morris points out that the vitalelements—symmetry, repetition, steadiness, rhythm—are the basic factors thatappeal to the eye in selecting a pattern, but they also appear in the productionof patterns. There is a “positive reaction to order rather than chaos,organization rather than confusion.” We can see from these studies that there isa preference in numerous species for specific types of visual patterns, the samepreferences that humans show. It seems that there is a biological basis to thepreference for some of the components of pictorial images.> > EARLIEST HUMAN ARTIn order to look for the origins of artistic endeavors in our direct ancestors,we need to look at what archaeological artifacts can tell us. Obviously we willnever know when the first melody was strung together and hummed merely forenjoyment. Much of decorative art is likewise ephemeral, being in the form offeathers, wood, paint, and clay. We can explore this question only by looking atartifacts that have survived: stashes of dyes, tools, shell and bone beads, androck art, such as can be seen in the caves of southern France and the wilds ofAustralia. We will discuss music a bit later on.The question of whether stone tools were a creative endeavor has spurred somecontroversy. Stone hand axes have been found with remains of Homo erectus datedfrom 1.4 million years ago,14 and examples have been found dating until about128,000 years ago. Although chimpanzees sometimes will use a stone as a tool tocrack open nuts, and even may carry a particular stone from one tree to another,they have never yet been observed in the wild intentionally flaking a stone tomake a tool.15 The basic design of the early hand ax and its productiontechnique remained stable over many thousands of years and across a widegeography. The axes appear to have been flaked along the path of leastresistance. They show a limited degree of imposed form, rather than an imaginedplan in mind. Later examples began being modified with more pleasing symmetries,distinctive twisting patterns, and different length-to-width ratios. Itcontinues to be debated whether stone hand axes represent only a mimeticability16 or are the early products of a developing creative imagination.British archaeologist Steven Mithen suggests that to fashion an ax out of arandom shape of stone may indicate the presence of creativity.15 But we aren’texactly concerned with creativity, which can produce articles of only functionalquality, but with art, aesthetic appeal. Ellen Dissanayake points out that someof the hand axes made by Homo erectus were made of pudding stone (conglomerate),which most people would call beautiful, rather than flint, which was moreabundant and easier to use. This suggests they may have had an interest in itsappearance. Later axes made by early Homo sapiens, dated at 250,000 years ago,incorporated fossils centrally (symmetrically!) displayed in their carving. Somehave been examined under an electron microscope and have been shown never tohave been used.1 Perhaps they were retained just for their aesthetic appeal.Although there is this evidence of some artistic sensibility, it appears to havebeen limited.Researchers interested in the origins of human art are of two camps. Somebelieve there was an explosive event, some sudden and major change in humanabilities and creativity that occurred about 30,000 to 40,000 years ago; othersbelieve it was a more gradual process with roots extending back millions ofyears. We will leave this argument to those so inclined and will take from itthe one thing that is agreed upon. There is evidence of decorative hand axes,beads, and ocher powders dating thousands of years before this period, but theoverwhelming number of artifacts that have been found have their origins in thelast 40,000 years. There was an explosion of artistic and creative activity thatincluded cave paintings and engravings found from Australia to Europe, as manyas ten thousand sculpted and engraved objects made from ivory, bone, antler,stone, wood, and clay found across Europe to Siberia, and sophisticated tools,such as sewing needles, oil lamps, harpoons, spear throwers, drills, and rope.Many archaeologists conclude that this explosion of creativity represents afundamental evolutionary event in the Homo sapiens lineage.17 Something changedin our brain that expanded its earlier creative abilities, something unique toHomo sapiens. Remember from chapter 1 the genetic variant of microcephalin thatarose approximately 37,000 years ago? Suddenly, about 40,000 years ago, whenlife could not have been easy street—with infectious diseases, hunting mishaps,shorter life spans, and no convenience stores, Prada, or Armani—anatomicallymodern Homo sapiens, in an unprecedented burst of creative and aestheticactivity, began painting pictures, wearing jewelry, and coming up with a host ofnew useful items. Why were they doing this, and what can this tell us about ourbrains?> > Evolutionary Theories About the Origins of ArtCharles Darwin considered the aesthetic sense an intellectual faculty that wasthe result of natural selection. Nobody else thought much about this until EllenDissanayake came along. She proposed that art is a biological behavior! Shebased this on several observations. To begin with, song, dance, storytelling,and painting are universal in all cultures. In most societies, art is anintegral part of most human activities and consumes a large portion of availableresources. For example, the men of the Owerri tribe in Nigeria who build andpaint ceremonial houses don’t have to participate in their day jobs for up totwo years. Arts give pleasure: Our motivation system seeks them out because theyreward us by making us feel good. Young children spontaneously engage indancing, drawing, and singing. Like Darwin, Dissanayake proposes that thebehavior of creating art has evolved through natural selection and that thefundamental behavioral tendency that lies behind the arts is what she calls“making special.”Making something special implies intent, and the intent is to distinguish anobject or action from the ordinary by appealing to the emotions through therhythms and textures and colors that it employs. Dissanayake thinks that “makingspecial” is a behavior that increases group cohesiveness and thus would providea survival advantage. A cohesive group in turn could increase individualsurvival. She suggests that in the past, the realm where one would want to makesomething out of the ordinary had to do with magic or the supernatural world, inthe form of rituals, not as it is done today for a purely aesthetic motive.Whatever one calls art, one is acknowledging that it is special in some way.Using “making special” as the major motivation of art as a behavior, one caninclude many behaviors and leave out the value judgments of whether it is “goodart.” We no longer need to think of art as being done for its own sake, whichmakes it easier to explain in an evolutionary context. Although many people havesuggested that art’s origins arose from a single motivation, such as bodyornamentation, a creative impulse, relief of boredom, or communication,Dissanayake proposes that it is composed of many parts—manipulation, perception,emotion, symbolism, and cognition—and arose alongside other humancharacteristics, such as tool making, the need for order, language, categoryformation, symbol formation, self-consciousness, creating culture, sociality,and adaptability. She proposes that the creation of art in terms of humanevolution was “to facilitate or sugarcoat socially important behavior,especially ceremonies, in which group values often of a sacred or spiritualnature were expressed and transmitted.”* [Human_split_089.html#filepos1443398]Geoffrey Miller, who, as you may remember, studies sexual selection, thinks thatthe arts are the result of sexual selection. He suggests that creativeindividuals had higher reproductive success. He proposes that the arts are likethe peacock’s tail—a fitness indicator. The more intricate, complex, andextravagant an artwork was, the greater the skill that was required to produceit, and the less functional it was for survival, the better it would be as afitness indicator. Such a work says, “I am so good at finding food and shelterthat I can spend half my time doing something that has no visible survivalvalue! Pick me to mate with and you will have some dynamite offspring who are ascapable as I.” Miller states, “the peacock’s tail, the nightingale’s song, thebowerbird’s nest, the butterfly’s wing, the Irish elk’s antlers, the baboon’srump, and the first three Led Zeppelin albums”18 were all examples of sexuallyselected fitness indicators. I guess he wasn’t as impressed with “Stairway toHeaven,” on Led Zeppelin IV, as others were.Steven Pinker is not so sure that the arts have an adaptive function at all butthinks rather they are a by-product of the brain’s other functions. He pointsout that the reasons on which Dissanayake bases her premise that the arts servean adaptive function—they are present in most cultures, use a lot of resources,and are pleasurable—can also be said of recreational drug use, which is hardlywhat one would call adaptive.From the evolutionary psychologist’s point of view, the brain is motivated byneeds that served biological fitness in our ancestral environment, such as food,sex and successful reproduction, safety and predator awareness, friendship, andstatus. When goals are attained, the body rewards us with a pleasure sensation.We hunted and caught the gazelle, we are now munching away at it, and we get apleasurable sensation. The human brain also has the ability to understand causeand effect and uses that to attain some goals. “If I hunt the gazelle and killit, I will have something to eat” (and unconsciously will be rewarded with apleasure sensation). Pinker thinks that the brain has put that together andfigured out that it can get the pleasure sensation without all the hard work ofactually attaining a goal. One way of doing this is taking recreational drugs;another way is through the senses that were designed to give off pleasuresignals when they came across a fitness-enhancing sensation. Thus we get apleasure signal when we eat something sweet and full of fat, a jelly doughnutfor instance.In our ancestral environment, it would have been fitness-enhancing to have amotivation to find and eat sweet food (ripe fruit) and fats, because they werehard to find and were good for survival. However, we know where that road leadstoday, when food is abundant. We are still motivated by the pleasure that wefeel when we eat sweets and fats, although it is no longer adaptive to have sucha strong motivation that is difficult to deny. Recreational drugs can alsoelicit a pleasurable feeling without having to do the work of attaining a goal.Listening to music gives us pleasure but doesn’t appear to enhance fitness…ordoes it? Pinker, however, does not have a closed mind. He is listening to JohnTooby and Leda Cosmides, directors of the Center for Evolutionary Psychology atthe University of California, Santa Barabara. They have another idea, and he islooking interested.> > Something Odd Is Going OnTooby and Cosmides originally were also of the opinion that the arts were aby-product, but now they don’t think that theory answers all the questions. Theystate, “Almost all the phenomena that are central to the humanities are puzzlinganomalies from an evolutionary perspective.”19 Especially odd is what they callthe attraction to the fictional experience, whether it is in a story, a drama, apainting, or other products of the imagination. If these phenomena didn’t existcross-culturally (involvement with fictional, imaginary worlds is another one ofthose human universals), no evolutionary psychologist would have predicted them.Another item in the list of odd phenomena is that the involvement withimaginative arts is self-rewarding without an obvious functional payoff. Why dopeople sit around and watch sitcoms or read novels or listen to stories? Is itjust a waste of time? Are they just a bunch of lazy couch potatoes? Why does thebrain contain reward systems that make fictional experiences enjoyable? Whywould we rather read a mystery story on a rainy afternoon than the repair manualfor our car, which could prove more useful? And why, when we read a story orwatch a movie, do some of our psychological responses kick in but not others?Why will we react emotionally but not physically? The movie may scare us, but wedon’t run out of the theater. If we are scared, why don’t we run? Why hasn’tthat unconscious reaction kicked in, as it would if we saw a snake? However, wemay remember the movie and act on the memory: We may not close the shower doorafter seeing Psycho. It seems that humans have a specialized system that allowsus to enter imaginary worlds.The neural machinery that permits this play in imaginary worlds can beselectively impaired. Children with autism have severely limited imagination,which suggests that it is a specialized subsystem, not a product of generalintelligence, which usually is normal in autism. In children, pretend playbegins to appear at about eighteen months, the same time that they begin tounderstand the existence of other minds. How is an infant able to understandthat a banana is something he can eat, but can also be a faux telephone? No onetakes him aside one day and says, “Son, a banana is a piece of food, but becauseit is shaped like a telephone receiver, we can pretend…wait a minute, pretend iswhat I am trying to explain, ah, we can substitute a banana for a telephonereceiver, it won’t really work, but if we want to play, I mean….” How does thechild understand faux anything? How does he know what is real and what isn’t?> > Separating Pretense from RealityAlan Leslie of Rutgers University proposed a special cognitive system thatseparates pretense from reality: a decoupling mechanism. He wrote: “Theperceiving, thinking organism ought, as far as possible, to get things right.Yet pretense flies in the face of this fundamental principle. In pretense wedeliberately distort reality. How odd then that this ability is not the soberculmination of intellectual development but instead makes its appearanceplayfully and precociously at the very beginning of childhood.”20 Tooby andCosmides conclude that the fact we have adaptations that prevent the mistakingof fact and fiction, and that there seems to be a reward system that allows usto enjoy fiction, implies that there is a benefit to the fictional experience.Good news for the authors of fiction! What could it be?In order to navigate the world successfully, one needs accurate information.Survival depends on it. People in general should prefer to read nonfictionrather than fiction, but instead, they would rather watch a fictional movie thana documentary; they prefer to read a historical novel rather than a historybook. However, when we really do want accurate information, we go to theencyclopedia rather than to Danielle Steele.> > Enhancing FitnessWhy do we have this appetite for the imaginary? To answer this question and thequestion of why we evolved aesthetic reactions, Tooby and Cosmides remind usthat fitness-enhancing adaptive changes can be made in three ways. They can bemade to the external world, with actions or appearances that increase sexualencounters (à la Miller’s sexual selection theory). These changes includecooperation (Dissanayake’s theory) and other mutual behaviors, like aggressivedefense, habitat selection, and feeding your infant. Adaptive changes can alsobe made so as to increase the fitness of the body, such as the pleasure rewardfor eating sugar and fat, vomiting to get rid of toxic food, and sleeping. Last,changes can be made to the brain. Fitness-enhancing changes to the brain includecapacities for play and learning. And here is where Tooby and Cosmides think oursearch should concentrate.> We think that the task of organizing the brain both physically and> informationally, over the course of the lifespan, is the most demanding> adaptive problem posed by human development. Building the brain, and readying> each of its adaptations to perform its function as well as possible is, we> believe, a vastly underrated adaptive problem. We think that there is an> entire suite of developmental adaptations that have evolved to solve these> adaptive problems, and that the possible existence of many of these> adaptations has gone largely unexamined. Thus, in addition to world-targeted> and body-targeted aesthetics, there is a complex realm of brain-targeted> aesthetics as well.19Do aesthetic experiences make our brains work better? Did Humphrey hit it on thehead? Was he right when he hinted that aesthetics was fundamental to learning?We are born with brains that have a lot of hardwired systems, but unlikecomputers, the more software you load into them and the more internalconnections that are forged, the faster and better they work. For instance, wehave language systems ready to learn a language, but the specific language isnot encoded. The hardware is there, but the software isn’t. Some of theinformation necessary for the development of the adaptation of language iseconomically stored in the external world; you have to input it. The genome doesnot have to be so complex if reliable information can be stored in the outsideworld. This is true not only for language but also for parts of the visualsystem and other systems. Tooby and Cosmides believe that we may have aestheticmotivations that have evolved to serve as a guidance system to prod us to seek,detect, and experience different aspects of the world, which will help ouradaptations reach their full capacities. We get rewarded with a pleasurablefeeling when we do this.With this in mind, the two researchers suggest that a neurocognitive adaptationmay have two modes. One is a functional mode. Once it is up and running, it doeswhat it has been designed to do. The functional mode of the language system isspeaking. The other mode is an organizational mode, which is what builds theadaptation and assembles what is necessary for the functional mode to startworking, as when a baby babbles to develop its language system. Theorganizational mode is necessary to produce the functional mode. The famousexample of not stimulating the organizational mode is Victor of Aveyron(François Truffaut’s L’Enfant Sauvage), the young boy who was found living alonein the wilds of France in 1797. Three years later, at the estimated age oftwelve, he allowed himself to be cared for by other humans. However, he wasnever able to learn language beyond a couple of words. It is now understood thatin order to learn to speak, one must be exposed to language at an early age.There appears to be a critical period in which one must be exposed to aparticular stimulus. Critical periods of learning are also documented in birds.A young chaffinch must hear an adult singing before it sexually matures, or itwill never properly learn the highly intricate song.21Critical periods have been identified to construct other adaptations, such asbinocular vision. The critical period for the development of a human child’sbinocular vision is thought to be between one and three years of age.22 Theorganizational mode of each different adaptation is expected to have a differentaesthetic component. In this way, Tooby and Cosmides explain that aestheticallydriven behavior only seems to be nonutilitarian because we are analyzing it fromthe aspect of changes adaptive to the external world, not to the internal worldof the brain. We see some nonutilitarian behavior, such as dancing, but we don’tsee how that affects the development of the brain. “Natural selection, arelentless but devious task-master, seduces you into devoting your free time tothese improving activities by making them gratifying.” It is fun—that is, itfeels good—to dance, so we do it. This happens when the external price is nottoo great and we are not concerned with competing for food, sex, and shelter.These circumstances are most often present when we are children.Tooby and Cosmides’ conclusion is a most important aspect of this discussion:“The payoff on such investments is greater earlier in the lifecycle, whencompeting opportunities are lower, the adaptations less well developed, and theindividual can expect to benefit over a longer subsequent lifespan from herinvestment in increased neuro-cognitive organization. For this reason we expectthat children should live according to behaviorally imperative aestheticsensibilities in an aesthetics-drenched world, although their standards of thefun and the beautiful will be somewhat different from our own.” It isinteresting to note that the male chimpanzees, as they matured and started tovie for mates and social position, were less inclined to paint.12 The externalcosts were becoming too great.Tooby and Cosmides’ answer to the nature-versus-nurture argument, which reallyshould be put to bed, is that we have genes that code for certain adaptations(nature), but in order to realize their full potential, certain exteriorconditions need to be met (nurture). “Innate ideas (and motivations) areincomplete ideas…. Our evolved inheritance is very rich compared to a blankslate, but very impoverished compared to a fully realized person.” They thinkthe arts are not frosting but baking soda.The two go on to propose an evolutionary theory of beauty, which they concede isnot very informative. “A human should find something beautiful because itexhibits cues which, in the environment in which humans evolved, signaled thatit would have been advantageous to pay sustained sensory attention to it, in theabsence of instrumental reasons for doing so. This includes everything frommembers of the opposite sex to game animals to the exhibition by others ofintricate skills…. However, the class of beautiful entities is immense andheterogeneous, with no other unifying principle except that our evolvedpsychological architecture is designed to motivate sustained attention to themthrough making the experience intrinsically rewarding.” They don’t believe thereis a general prescription for beauty, but there are several subsets that havestrict principles that differ for different applications, such as sexualattractiveness, and landscape.An example they use is that many natural phenomena are considered beautiful,such as a starry night, natural landscapes, the pattering of rain, and runningwater. As we sit in the chaise longue on a warm evening, or lean back from thecampfire and gaze up at the desert sky (where we can actually see the stars), orlean back in our chair while gazing up at a leafy plane tree and listening to afountain’s burble in a square in Aix-en-Provence, what we experience is thepleasure (emotionally positive response) of relaxed attention. But why is itrelaxed? They think this is caused by an organizational mode adaptation thatprovides us with an innate program for these invariable phenomena. Weunconsciously know what they should sound or look like. They are the defaultmode, and they are aesthetically pleasing. They are used as test patternsagainst which actual perceptions are compared. The scene agrees with the innateprinciple of babbling brook and leafy green tree. It is when a stimulus variesfrom the programmed default that increased attention is aroused. When the birdsand frogs stop chirping, when the stars disappear, and when the babble becomes aroar, our attention becomes focused.So what does this all have to do with our attraction to fictional experience?Tooby and Cosmides suggest that it increases the opportunities in whichadaptation-organizing experiences can occur: nurture building on nature. Pretendplay, such as hide-and-seek, can develop skills that are better learned in aplay situation than when they may need to be actually used. It would be fitnessenhancing to learn to hide or run from a predator, or stalk and search for food,before one actually needs to do it for survival. If you recall, one thing thatis correlated with brain size is amount of play. We discussed play in terms ofpractice for real life, stress reduction, and sexual selection, but not in termsof imagination. From having read the fictional story about the boy who criedwolf when we were children, we can remember what happened to him in the storyand not have to learn that lesson the hard way in real life. The more fictionalstories we hear, the more circumstances we become familiar with, without havingto actually experience them. If we do run across the same circumstances in life,then we will have a wealth of background info to draw from. “This same thinghappened to Sally in that movie. What did she do? Oh yeah…that worked out prettywell, I think I’ll try that.” It is interesting to note that throughout worldliterature, there appears to be a limited number of scenarios, and they are allrelated to evolutionary concerns, such as protection from predators, parentalinvestment, proper relationships with kin and non-kin, and mate selection, toname a few, and all fiction draws on these.23> > Becoming Mentally FlexibleThe core ability that enables us to use all this fictional information is thedecoupling device separating pretense from reality in our brains, which Leslieproposed. This device appears to be uniquely human. Tooby and Cosmides commentthat humans are radically different from other species in the amount ofcontingently true information we use. We can categorize information as alwaystrue, true only on Thursdays, true only when told by a related person, true ifdone before winter, true if you are talking about orange trees but not plumtrees, used to be true but isn’t now, true in the mountains but not in thedesert, true about lions but not about gazelles, true when Josh is talking aboutSarah but not about Gabby, etc. Our ability to use contingently true informationis unique. Our brains store not just absolute facts but information that may betrue only temporarily or locally or to a specific individual. And we can breakinformation down into component parts and keep this info stored and separatedfrom other info. We can mix and match info from different times, places, andinput types, and we can make inferences based on the source. This allows us toseparate fact from fiction, and also to know that the store is open every day inthe summer but not in the winter. This has allowed us to be very flexible andadapt to different environments.Joseph Carroll, an English professor at the University of Missouri interested inDarwinian theory, points out:> To the modern human mind, alone among all minds in the animal kingdom, the> world does not present itself as a series of rigidly defined stimuli releasing> a narrow repertory of stereotyped behaviors. It presents itself as a vast and> perplexing array of percepts and contingent possibilities. The human mind is> free to organize the elements of its perception in an infinitely diverse array> of combinatorial possibilities. And most of those potential forms of> organization, like most major mutations, would be fatal. Freedom is the key to> human success, and it is also an invitation to disaster. This is the insight> that governs E. O. Wilson’s penetrating explanation for the adaptive function> of the arts. “There was not enough time for human heredity to cope with the> vastness of new contingent possibilities revealed by high intelligence…. The> arts filled the gap.”24So the arts may be useful as a form of learning. As Humphrey suggested, theyhelp us categorize, they increase our predictive power, and they help us reactwell in different situations—and thus as Tooby and Cosmides suggest, they docontribute to survival.> > AND WHAT ABOUT BEAUTY? IT’S BIOLOGIC, BABY!It boils down to this: What people find beautiful is not arbitrary or random buthas evolved over millions of years of hominid sensory, perceptual, and cognitivedevelopment. Sensations and perceptions that have adaptive value (i.e., thatenhance safety, survival, and reproduction) often become aestheticallypreferred. What evidence do we have for this? To begin with, remember that everydecision is funneled through the approach-or-withdraw module in the brain: Is itsafe or not? And these decisions happen fast.You’ll recall that people have an instantaneous reaction, using what JonathanHaidt calls the like-o-meter.25 For instance, people will judge whether theylike or dislike a Web page in 0.5 seconds, and the stronger their evaluation thefaster it happens.26 What is it that influences how our like-o-meter reacts?What are the physical elements in a visual or auditory stimulus that make onelike it, dislike it, or respond fearfully to it?More is known about the visual system than about other systems. There seem to becertain elements that can be extracted from an image extremely quickly. Apreference for symmetry has been shown to exist cross-culturally,27, 28 and hasalso been found in other animals, as I have mentioned earlier. It also plays arole in mate selection. Symmetry is associated with mating success or sexualattractiveness in many species, including humans.29 For example, symmetry inboth sexes is associated with increased genetic, physical, and mental health.30Men with symmetrical features have greater facial attractiveness31 and lowermetabolic rates,32 attract a greater number of sexual partners, have sex at anearlier age,33 and have more extra-pair copulations.34 In women, asymmetry iscorrelated with increased health risks,35 while symmetry is associated withhigher fertility 32, 36, 37 and facial attractiveness.38 Ovulating women aremore attracted to the body scent of symmetrical men, and symmetrical men aremore muscular and active.39 The voices of both men and women with greaterbilateral symmetry were rated as more attractive by members of both sexes thanthose with asymmetrical traits.40 Symmetry seems to be an important indicator ofgenetic quality and attractiveness for potential mates of both sexes. It seemsthe preference for symmetry has its roots in biology and sexual selection.Reber, Schwarz, and Winkielman suggest that it is not symmetry per se that ispreferred, but the fact that it has less information and is easier to process.10It also appears that when one is judging the attractiveness of human faces,beauty is not all in the eye of the beholder. Faces judged attractive in oneculture are also judged attractive by other cultures.41, 42 This makes sense ifbiologically relevant characteristics are revealed by attractiveness.Babies as young as six months old prefer to look at attractive (as judged byadults’ preferences) faces. This effect is independent of race, gender, and age;it indicates an innate sense of what a human judges to be attractive.43 Womenwith more attractive, healthy, feminine faces have higher estrogen levels andthus reproduce better.44 Sexual selection has provided an aesthetic concept forfacial attractiveness.People also like curved objects better than angular ones. Researchers correctlypredicted that emotionally neutral objects with primarily pointed features andsharp angles would be less well liked than corresponding objects with curvedfeatures (e.g., a guitar with a sharp-angled contour compared to a guitar with acurved contour). The rationale for this prediction was that sharp transitions ina contour might convey a sense of threat, on either a conscious or anonconscious level, and would trigger a negative bias.45 Or is it because curvesare processed more easily?Humans easily make aesthetic judgments about shapes. Richard Latto coined theterm aesthetic primitive to suggest that a shape or form is aestheticallypleasing because it is more effectively and more easily processed, due to theprocessing properties of the human visual system.46 To find evidence for this,he investigated a phenomenon known as the oblique effect, which he attributes toJoseph Jastrow, who first described it in 1892.47 Observers with normal visionare better at perceiving, discriminating, and manipulating horizontal andvertical lines than oblique ones. He wondered, if people are better atperceiving them, do they like them better? Apparently so: Latto found thathumans prefer pictures whose component lines are verticals and horizontalsrather than oblique angles.48People recognize objects faster when there is high contrast between an objectand its background. Contrast makes identification easier. Objects are moreeasily processed with higher contrast. People also like higher-contrastpictures. Is this because they process them more easily or because of thecontrast per se? If stimuli are presented quickly, people prefer the highcontrast, but if they are given more time to decide, the preference weakens.Reber, Schwarz, and Winkielman have found that contrast influenced aestheticjudgments only at short exposure times. If someone is given more time to processa picture, then the ease of processing is no longer a factor in the decision,10so it is not the objective factor of contrast that caused the earlier decision,but the fluency of the processing.We also appear to have an innate preference for natural landscapes. Whencomparing urban landscapes, people prefer those that contain some vegetation.49,50 Hospital patients with views of outside trees feel better, recover faster,and require less pain medication than those looking out on a brick wall.51 Whatis really interesting is that we have a preference for particular types oflandscapes. People always prefer to have water in their landscapes, but whenthis variable is excluded, there is yet another preference. When shown a seriesof photographs of five natural landscapes—tropical rain forest, temperatedeciduous forest, coniferous forest, savanna, and desert—the youngest subjects(those in the third and fifth grades) picked the savanna as a preferredlandscape. Older subjects equally preferred those landscapes with which theywere familiar, as well as the savanna.52 People were happier viewing scenes withtrees rather than inanimate objects, and also preferred the shapes of trees withspreading canopies, similar to those found on the African savanna, rather thanrounded or columnar ones. This was true even of people who were raised in areaswhere round or columnar trees were dominant.53Gordon Orians, an emeritus professor of ecology at the University of Washington,formulated the savanna hypothesis. He proposed that human aesthetic responses totrees with spreading forms would be based on innate knowledge (of our ancestralhabitat) of the shapes of trees that would be associated with productive humanhabitats in our ancestral landscapes.54What is it about natural landscapes that attract the brain? Can you sayfractals? Nature’s patterns are not the simple shapes we learned in geometryclass. Trees are not triangles, and clouds are not rectangles. We learned tofind the areas of squares and circles and triangles, and the volumes of cubesand cones and spheres. That was Euclidian geometry, and this is a whole otherball of wax. We did not learn to find the area of a tree’s branches or thevolume of a cloud (luckily). Nature’s forms are more complex.Many natural objects have what is known as fractal*[Human_split_090.html#filepos1443609] geometry, consisting of patterns thatrecur at increasing magnification. Mountains, clouds, coastlines, rivers withall their tributaries, and branching trees all have fractal geometry, as do ourcirculatory system and our lungs. For instance, we can see the veins on aleaflet, then the leaflets that make up a leaf and the leaves on a branch andthe branches that make up a tree. If I gave you an empty piece of paper andasked you to draw a branching tree on it, how could you describe to me how densethe branching is that you drew? Well, there is a measurement called D. The emptypaper would have a D of 1. A completely blackened paper would have a D of 2.Somewhere in between is the amount of branching you drew. When you show peoplefractal versus nonfractal patterns, 95 percent of people prefer fractalpatterns.55 Humans generally prefer scenes with a D (fractal density) of 1.3 andlow complexity,56, 57 and they have a lower stress response when observingthem.58, 59 This may explain why hospital patients improve faster in a “roomwith a view.” They look out and see a natural fractal pattern of 1.3 D. Thispreference for fractal patterns with a D of 1.3 extends from natural scenes toart and photography,60 independent of gender and cultural background.61Richard Taylor, a physicist at the University of Oregon, wondered if the eye isaesthetically “tuned” to the fractals surrounding us in nature.62 Is it someproperty of the visual system that makes us prefer fractals of specificdimensions? How does it discern them in complex scenes? Taylor knew two thingsabout eyes. One was that the eye fixates predominately on the borders of objectswhile examining a scene, and the other was that the edge contours play adominant role in the perception of fractals. Putting those two facts together,he figured the tuning might be through silhouettes. His group has found thatpeople like skyline scenes with fractal values of 1.3!63 He suggests that itmight not be merely that people like natural scenes but that they like anyscenes with the right fractal value. Gerard Manly Hopkins’s “likeness temperedwith difference” actually has a specific D number. If this is so, then designingarchitecture and objects with this fractal value would make them more pleasingto the human psyche and perhaps lead to less stressful urban landscapes.So there is plenty of evidence that there are some hardwired processes that areinfluencing our preferences and our visceral reactions. But we all know thatsome of our aesthetic preferences have changed as we have gotten older orperhaps studied some form of art. We didn’t like opera, but now we do. We didn’tlike Asian art, but now we do. We didn’t like Andy Warhol, and we still don’t.We used to like colonial furniture, and now we don’t. Our preferences evolveover time. What causes them to change?The fluency theory of Reber and his colleagues suggests that the variouspreferences described above are things our brains have evolved to processquickly, and when we process something quickly, we get a positive response. Weprocess the fractal D 1.3 quickly and get a positive reaction. They have beenable to measure this. Positive emotional responses increase activity over thezygomaticus major, or smiling muscle, in our faces. This response can bemeasured with electromyography. When we see something that our brain processeswith high fluency, we actually get increased activity in this muscle way beforea judgment about it is made. We get a little positive priming action for thejudgment we are about to make. They have shown that this positive emotionalresponse then contributes to the aesthetic judgment, “Yes, that’s good, I likeit.” So the basis for our aesthetic judgment is not the fluency alone, butfluency coupled with the positive response that one feels when something isprocessed quickly.10 This means that what we like is the process, not thestimulus. Plato was wrong, beauty is not independent of the observer. It canalso explain why, if someone tells you, “You aren’t going to like this!” beforeyou process it, the negative bias may overwhelm the positive one you would havereceived on your own.We like things that are familiar. We have all had the experience of not reallyliking something the first time we have seen it or heard it, but over time ithas “grown on us.” We increase our processing fluency with increased exposure.The liking of familiar things and wariness of the new obviously can be adaptive.In exposing ourselves to the unfamiliar, our memory, learning, and culture areinvolved. They are supplying past data about what we are exposed to, or forgingnew neural connections to accommodate new information, or speeding up theprocessing of recently novel stimuli. This is another type of fluency besidesperception. This is conceptual fluency: the meaning of a stimulus. Sometimesmore complex stimuli are necessary to convey meaning. This is what Donald Normanwas referring to as beauty in depth, in meaning and implication—reflectivebeauty.> > Neural Correlates of BeautyWhat is going on in the brain when it observes aesthetically pleasing sights?Hideaki Kawabata and Semir Zeki at University College London had some universitystudents with no specific art education look at three hundred differentpaintings, then rank on a scale of 1 to 10 whether they were ugly, neutral, orbeautiful. Different subjects picked different paintings, and some paintingsthat were in the beautiful category for one person were in the ugly category foranother. Then a few days later, each student had an fMRI scan while looking atthe pictures she or he had ranked most beautiful, most ugly, and neutral. Byhaving the students themselves decide the categories before the viewing,Kawabata and Zeki could scan them knowing whether the student thought it anaesthetically pleasing painting or not.They postulated that because beauty and ugliness were extremes of a continuum,instead of separate areas of the brain functioning for the two differentjudgments, it was just as likely that there might be a difference in theintensity of an activation of the same areas. They found when subjects wereviewing the paintings, the orbitofrontal cortex, which is known to be engagedduring the perception of rewarding stimuli, was active, and it was more activewhen viewing a beautiful painting. The motor cortex was also active, becomingmore active when viewing an ugly painting, as it is with other unpleasantstimuli, such as transgressions of social norms, and with fearful stimuli,including scary voices and faces, and anger.6 This makes sense when we rememberthat we are directly wired to be best and fastest at avoiding danger, which ouremotions categorize as unpleasant or negative.However, in Kawabata and Zeki’s experiment, the aesthetic judgment had alreadybeen made. It seems more likely that what they learned was what areas were usedafter the judgment had been made. Camilo Cela-Conde and his group wonderedwhether part of the prefrontal cortex, the most evolutionarily advanced part ofthe human brain, was active in the actual aesthetic judgment. They were curiousabout the fact that there was a great proliferation of art about 35,000 yearsago, and wondered if this had anything to do with changes in the prefrontalcortex. They designed their study differently than Kawabata and Zeki. They hadsome people look at pictures of artwork of different styles, and photographs ofdifferent landscapes both natural and urban, and scanned their brains as theywere doing so. If subjects found the picture beautiful, they raised theirfinger. Because the experiment was set up in this way, these subjects were alsodeciding what they thought was beautiful, but deciding it while being scanned.By watching what areas of the brain were being used over a period of time,Cela-Conde and his colleagues could track the input from the visual system andsee where it went. Cool, huh? They were able to confirm what others had foundabout the visual system, that it indeed has different stages in the processingof forms and that there was activation beyond the visual system in theprefrontal cortex. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is known to becritical for the monitoring of events in the working memory and, along with thecingulated cortex, is known to be active in decision making. In this case, thecingulated cortex was active in deciding between beautiful and not beautiful,but the dlPFC was active only when the decision was “beautiful.” They also foundthat when something was judged beautiful, there was more activity in the lefthemisphere. This activation of the prefrontal cortex in deciding that somethingis beautiful supports the hypothesis that a change in the prefrontal cortexallowed artistic profusion in anatomically modern Homo sapiens, and to a limitedextent in Neanderthals.They also suggest that because the left hemisphere was more active in aestheticjudgments, cerebral dominance may have a role.3It seems that when something is deemed beautiful, we have more than an emotionalreaction. Other parts of our brain are engaged, parts that are more evolved inus than in other species. We should be glad that our dogs don’t have the sameaesthetic sense. If they were influenced by beauty, there might not be thatunconditional love thing with them. We might have to get out of ourpaint-streaked jeans, get a haircut, or put on makeup for them to wag theirtails. We might have to go on a diet.> > WHAT ABOUT MUSIC?Marc Hauser at Harvard and Josh McDermott at MIT, among many others, classifymusic as a uniquely human endeavor.64 Only humans compose music, learn to playmusical instruments, and then play them together in cooperative (usually)ensembles, bands, and orchestras. None of the other great apes create music orsing. Too bad, or Greystoke: the Legend of Tarzan could have been a musical.That means that our common ancestor didn’t sing.What about birdcalls? They certainly sound like music. Hauser and McDermott saybirdsong is a different kettle of fish. Birds sing only in certain contexts:mating and territorial defense. Singing is done primarily by males, and its solefunction is for communication. This also seems to be true of whales. It is notdone for pure enjoyment. Apparently, birds don’t sing alone in the shower. Andbirds don’t change their scales or the key in which they sing. There are notelephone-line quartets tweeting harmonies in the bird world. You see a canyonwren; you hear the descending call of a canyon wren. A canyon wren doesn’t allof a sudden change its song from the key of C to A-sharp minor and add a littlerhumba beat at the end.Songbirds are a bit more variable. Some songbird species can mimic and learn thecalls of other species and may splice parts of one call with another, althoughthey prefer the calls of their own species.65 There are, however, limitations ofvarious kinds with different species of birds, and no bird species is equallyable to acquire new songs at any time of its life. There are sensitive periodswhen they are able to learn songs more readily.It is interesting to consider, however, that just as birds have constraints ontheir auditory systems and what and when they sing, and on when and how theylearn and remember their songs, so we too have constraints on our auditorysystem, on what we consider pleasing music, and on when and how we learn to playand remember it—and we may share some of these constraints with other animals.Comparative studies of these constraints are just beginning.However, there is something unique going on in our brains that has picked up thetempo, so to speak. We compose new music, play it, and listen to it not just toattract chicks, pay the bills, or impress our friends. We can pick up the fiddleand fire off a tune when we are alone, just for the sheer pleasure of it.Inventing and playing music uses all our cognitive machinery, as anyone knowswho has learned to play. It is not an easy assignment. Perception, learning andmemory, attention, motor action, emotion, abstraction, and theory of mind areall harnessed into action. Music is another one of those human universals.66,67, 68 Every culture in the present and in the past has had some form of music.People like to boogie. Perhaps the oldest musical instrument that has been foundis a fragment of a bone flute made from the femur of the now-extinct Europeanbear. It was excavated in 1995 by paleontologist Ivan Turk in a Neanderthalburial mound in Divje Babe, Slovenia. Whether this is truly a flute iscontroversial. It has been determined to be around 50,000 years old. In alllikelihood, there were probably drums from earlier dates that were made ofmaterials that have not been preserved.69 To the consternation of those whoattribute the tonal octave to relatively recent western music, still playable9,000-year-old flutes have been found in Jiahu, China. These flutes sound tonalscales, one of them an octave.70> > We Are All MusiciansThe adaptive theories of music have explanations similar to the ones we heardfor visual art. Steven Pinker ruffled feathers, as only he can do, a few yearsago when he wrote that he suspected that music was auditory cheesecake and thatperhaps it had no adaptive purpose but was a by-product of other functions.2Cheesecake? Many disagree with his conclusion and think music serves an adaptivefunction. Like the other arts, perhaps it has been sexually selected to attractmates (the arguably adaptable Mick Jagger effect) and to signal mate quality, asthe sexual-selection advocate, Geoffrey Miller, suggests.18 Or maybe it acted asa social bonding system, much like language, that synchronized mood and perhapsprepared the group to act in unison, thus binding coalitions and groups.69, 71But if these were true, why would anyone play music when they were alone?Research on this topic is in its infancy, and there is no widely acceptedconcept.Once again, Darwin had something to say. He suspected that music may originallyhave been adaptive as a form of communication, a protolanguage, that later wasreplaced by language. If that was true, music now is a “fossil” of a formeradaptation. Tecumseh Fitch, a linguist from University of St. Andrews, Scotland,following Darwin’s reasoning, suggests that that would put music in a subtlecategory of former adaptations having a biologically grounded cognitive domainthat are currently being used not as originally selected for but not in acompletely different manner either.72Speech shares many features with music and also with primate vocalizations, suchas pitch, timbre, rhythm, and changes in volume and frequency. These are allthings that we are good at identifying even without musical training. You maythink that you don’t know anything about these aspects of music, but if I askyou to sing your favorite song, you will be able to do it pretty well. In fact,when Dan Levitin, a former rock-and-roll music producer turned neuroscientistand now a professor at McGill University, asked students to sing their favoritesong, they easily reproduced the pitch and tempo of songs.73, 74 If I play anote on a piano and the same note on a violin, you will be able to tell which iswhich. That means that you can recognize the timbre of the note. In fact, youknew all that stuff when you were a baby.Sandra Trehub, who studies the developmental origins of music in infants at theUniversity of Toronto, summarizes findings that babies from at least six monthsold have relative pitch: They can recognize a melody even if it is played in adifferent key.75 The only time any other mammal has demonstrated relative pitchwas in one experiment done on only two rhesus monkeys.76 But they weren’t asgood as babies. They could recognize melodies played an octave apart as beingthe same, but not if they were played in different keys or in an atonal scale.Babies also recognize melodies if they are played at different tempos. This isnot because they can’t tell the difference between them; they are verydiscriminating. They can differentiate between semitones in a scale, changes inthe timbre, tempo, meter, and grouping of notes, and duration. They can tellconsonance from dissonance from the age of two months, and they preferconsonance and harmonic music to dissonant.*[Human_split_091.html#filepos1444362] This does not appear to be culturallyengendered, but that has been difficult to prove. Babies who have never heardany form of music are rare. Even fetuses respond to music with changes of heartrate.77Music has proven to be a difficult research topic because it has all thosecomponents I have already mentioned: pitch, timbre, meter, rhythm, harmony,melody, loudness, and tempo. These are part of musical syntax and are also partof verbal syntax.Have you ever tried to speak a foreign language? Trying to be social with a busdriver in Italy on a rainy day, I asked, “Dov’e il sole?” a short and simplesentence. He looked at me puzzled. I thought to myself, I know I have the wordsright. He must just be perverse in not recognizing them. But then I thoughtabout all the times someone has said something to me in English with a foreigncadence and I haven’t been able to understand him or her. The words werecorrect, but the emphasis was on the wrong syllables, or the wrong word in thesentence was emphasized, or the words ran together incorrectly. I realized I hadpronounced sole with the accent on the second syllable, as if I were sayingsoleil in French, rather than on the first syllable. Think of the sentence“Sunday was a lovely day for sailing,” but say it as if it were written “Sundaywas, a love lyday forsai ling.” Your companion would look puzzled too. Prosodyis the musical cues of language: melody, meter, rhythm, and timbre. Prosodyhelps delineate the word and phrase boundaries. Some languages are very melodic,like Italian. Some languages, such as Chinese, are tonal, which means that thesame word means different things just by varying the pitch. Some researchersthink that the brain, at least at an early age, treats language as a specialcase of music.78We know that music can convey emotion, just as some animal calls can. However,music can convey meaning other than emotion.79 It can actually prime you for therecognition of words. There is a way to measure with an EEG how semanticallysimilar the brain recognizes words to be. Just as when a person is presentedwith a sentence such as “The sky is blue,” and then recognizes the word colorafterward as being more closely related than the word billboard, a certainpassage of music will prime you to afterward recognize certain words as beingmore semantically related to the music than others. For example, after hearingmusical notes that sound like a clap of thunder, you would find the word thundermore related than the word pencil. In fact, when words were presented that thecomposer, by his own admission, was trying to convey, such as stitch (as insewing), they were actually the words that the listener found to be related.Many musical sounds are universally recognized to convey certain meanings. Likelanguage, music has phrase structure and recursion. You can create an endlessvariety of musical phrases by putting together different notes and groups ofnotes. Just as humans are easily able to assemble phrases into an infinitenumber of meaningful sentences, we are able to structure and process multiplemusical phrases. It appears that humans are the only animals with the ability todo this both verbally and musically.80Music and language also share some of the same neural areas. Dan Levitin,working with Vinod Menon at Stanford, has found two regions of the frontal lobe*[Human_split_092.html#filepos1444689] that are closely associated with theprocessing of language and are also active when listening to classical musicwith no accompanying song. They speculate that this area is used to processstimuli that evolve over time, not only words but musical notes.81 Otherresearchers have found that if you hear a chord that is not “right,” somethingyour brain does not expect to hear, an area in your right frontal cortex†[Human_split_093.html#filepos1444974] is activated, as well as the area thatcorresponds to that area in the left frontal cortex, which is thought of as thelanguage network.‡ [Human_split_094.html#filepos1445194]82, 83 Thiscorresponding area in the left hemisphere is also activated when you hear aphrase structure that is wrong, such as “dog walked park he.” These areas appearto be sensitive to violations in expected structure, and in the left hemispherethere is an overlap between music and language processing.Just as we like to hear a good story or look at a starry sky, we also play musicbecause we like to hear it. What do we like to hear? As I mentioned before, welike consonance, and, though you might freak out when I tell you this, there isanother fractal thing going on with music. Scaling noise is a type of soundwhose quality is unaffected by how fast it is played. White noise is thesimplest example. It is monotonous at any play speed. It is at one end of thespectrum of scaling noise; it is made up of completely random frequencies. Atthe other end is noise that is completely predictable, like a dripping faucet.In the middle is noise with what is known as 1/f spectra; it is partially randomand partially predictable. The amplitude and pitch fluctuations of naturalsounds, such as running water, rain, and wind, often exhibit 1/f spectra.84, 85In other words, large, abrupt changes in pitch or loudness occur less frequentlyin nature than gentle, gradual fluctuations. Most music falls into the samerange of 1/f spectra.84 Furthermore, human listeners reportedly prefer1/f-spectra melodies to melodies with faster or slower changes in pitch andloudness. Many auditory cortical neurons are tuned to the dynamical propertiesof the natural acoustic environment,86 which could explain why stimuli withnaturalistic amplitude spectra are processed dramatically better than otherstimuli.87 Back to the old fluency in processing theory: We process it moreeasily, so we end up liking it. It’s pretty interesting that both our auditorysystem and our visual system have this built-in preference for naturallandscapes and sounds. It’s also interesting that one of the dictionarydefinitions for art was the human effort to imitate nature.So we are listening to some music, and it puts us in a good mood. At least theStones do. But sometimes it makes us sad. And what about that music in Jaws?That made us tense. Music can actually elicit emotions.88 In fact, you can getso emotional that you get a physiologic reaction, such as the chill down yourspine and changes in your heart rate.89 But even more interesting, you can blockthat reaction by getting injected with the drug nalaxone,90 which blocks thebinding of opioid receptors. It is well established the body produces a naturalhigh by releasing its own opioid when we listen to music that we like. Nalaxone,the same drug that is given to someone who has overdosed on heroin and makes itto the ER on time, will also block the binding of the natural opiates that yourbody produces. The first hints of what was going on in the brain came from scansdone on musicians91 as they listened to music that gave them the “chills.” Thesame brain structures* [Human_split_095.html#filepos1445422] were activated thatare active in response to other euphoria-inducing activities, such as eatingfood (fats and sugars), sex, and downing so-called recreational drugs.Menon and Levitin were able to do more-specific scans with nonmusicians andfound that the hypothalamus was activated (which modulates heart rate,respiration, and the “chills”), as were specific neural areas that are crucialfor reward processing. They also found evidence for a correlation betweendopamine release and the response to pleasant music. This is a big finding.Dopamine is known to regulate opioid transmission, and increased levels aretheorized to cause positive affect.92 This release of dopamine also happens as areward when one drinks water and eats food, and also is the reinforcing effectof addictive drugs. Is music rewarded because it too is a survival-relatedstimulus? Or is it auditory cheesecake, just another recreational drug? Thisquestion has not yet been answered, but one thing is for sure: Music doesincrease positive affect, just as some visual stimuli do.Increasing positive affect is a good thing, whether it is from auditory, visual,or any other sensory experience. Being in a good mood increases cognitiveflexibility and facilitates creative problem solving in many different settings.It has been shown to increase verbal fluency. People with a positive affectwiden category groups by finding more similarities between objects, people, orsocial groups, enabling a socially distinct out-group to be placed into abroader mutual in-group—“Well, I know he is a Lakers fan, but at least he lovesto fish!” This results in less conflict. Having a positive affect makes tasksseem more rich and interesting. Interesting tasks make work more rewarding andinduce people to find improved outcomes in problem solving. A good moodstimulates you to seek variety in safe pursuits, making you more inventive ondates. It just makes you a more pleasant and less rigid person to be around.This in itself would have adaptive potential.> > Does Music Affect Our Thinking Abilities?Spatial abilities are used to create, think of, remember, and change visualimages in one’s mind. For instance, looking at a two-dimensional map and beingable to visualize its information in three dimensions to find one’s way aroundin a city uses spatial ability. A few years ago, there was a suggestion thatlistening to certain classical music would increase your spatial abilities.93 Itbecame dubbed the Mozart effect. However, it proved difficult to confirm, andlater studies revealed that it wasn’t listening to classical music or Mozart perse that made you smarter, but rather listening to music you prefer puts you in abetter mood. When you are in a good mood, you are aroused, and this can lead toenhanced performance on a variety of tests of cognitive ability. Arousal stimuliaren’t limited to music. One can be aroused by other preferred stimuli, such asa licking a glob of Nutella off your finger, or drinking a cup of coffee.94Moreover, listening to music and actually taking music lessons are two differentthings in terms of their effect on the brain. Glenn Schellenberg, at theUniversity of Toronto, has found in a randomly assigned group of six-year-oldchildren who received keyboard lessons, voice lessons, drama lessons, or nolessons that music lessons in childhood are associated with small butlong-lasting increases in IQ. (He incidentally found that drama lessons enhancesocial behavior but not IQ.) This increase was not affected by family income orparents’ education, nor was it seen with other types of extracurricular studies.Learning music made you a little bit smarter. You can safely bet that thesefindings have sparked a great deal of interest. Proof of training in one fieldthat generalizes to others has been hard to find.In a detailed review of transfer effects, the ability to transfer knowledgegained in one context to another very similar context (near transfer) ordissimilar context (far transfer), Steve Ceci and colleagues95 found littleevidence in a century’s worth of previous studies for far transfer. Althoughthere is little evidence for it, there is widespread belief that far transferoccurs, and this belief is central to Western concepts of education.Schellenberg points out that the goals of formal education are not just to buildskills in reading, writing, and arithmetic but to develop the capacity forreasoning and critical thinking. His data that reveal music lessons increase IQare a rare example of far transfer and might actually contribute to thisprocess.96 Should we be putting band and music lessons back in school programsinstead of trimming them from the budgets? Do we know what music training doesfor the brain? We know a little but not exactly why it may increase IQ.We know that musicians are using many skills at one time. They are seeing notesthat are written and translating them to a special motor activity that has atime line. This involves both hands and in some cases the legs and feet, themouth, and the lungs. Musicians use intonation and timing to imply emotion, theymay transpose music to different keys, and they may improvise melodies andharmonies. Long passages are committed to memory. Musicians often sing and playat the same time. Certain brain regions in musicians are bigger than innonmusicians. It is not known if this is due to learning to play an instrumentor if children who choose to learn an instrument have neural differences tobegin with, but there is much evidence to suggest that learning causes thesechanges. There are also greater differences in the size of certain brain regionsin those who began musical training at an earlier age. For instance, violinplayers have a larger region for the fingers of their left hand, the effectbeing smaller for the thumb, which is not used to an equal extent, and theoverall increase is greater in violinists who started their training at ayounger age.97 There are also corresponding size differences that correlate withthe intensity of musical training throughout life. Professional musicians(keyboard players) have more gray matter volume in motor, auditory, andvisual-spatial brain regions compared with amateur musicians and nonmusicians.98These and other similar studies suggest that musical training can increase thesize of certain neural structures. There are also suggestions that along withincreases of IQ, it enhances verbal memory (you’ll be able to remember jokesbetter), motor ability (you’ll be a better dancer), visual-spatial abilities(you’ll be better at juggling), the ability to copy geometric figures, andpossibly mathematical ability.Helen Neville’s group at the University of Oregon is currently investigating theold chicken-and-egg question: Does music cause improvements in cognition, or arepeople with strong cognitive skills more likely to make the effort to learnmusic? Learning music requires focused attention, abstract and relationalthinking, and what is known as executive control in the brain. Do the kids whostudy music already have these abilities, or does learning music develop them?Neville and her colleagues are testing groups of children aged three to fiverecruited from a Head Start program. Their preliminary findings are that thechildren in each of the music/arts groups have more significant gains inlanguage and preliterary skills than the gains made by children in the regularHead Start group. Children who received music/arts training also displayedsignificant gains in attention, visual-spatial skills, and numeracy. Children inthe attention-training intervention displayed a similar pattern. If theseresults hold up, they suggest that training in music and the arts does improvelanguage, attention, visual-spatial, and numeracy skills.99Improving attention is also important. One aspect of attention, executiveattention, concerns the mechanisms for self-regulation of cognition and emotion,such as concentration and impulse control. Being able to control emotionalimpulses can be lifesaving in panic situations.*[Human_split_096.html#filepos1445695] How well this works is partly undergenetic control, but Michael Posner and colleagues at the University of Oregonwondered if home and school environments could also exert an influence, as theydo for other cognitive networks. This group has found that children aged four tosix who participated in attention-training tasks improved their emotionalcontrol.100 This improvement was equal to that garnered over the passage ofdevelopmental time. They suggest that the immature system can be trained tofunction in a more mature way and also argue that the effect of attentiontraining extends to more general skills, such as those measured by intelligencetests.† [Human_split_097.html#filepos1445967]Currently a group from Boston101 is running a long-term study with the otherchicken-and-egg problem of brain size. Do children who choose to participate inmusical training (piano or string instruments) show neural differences prior totraining compared to a control group of children not seeking music lessons? Theyare also testing whether the music students have innately superiorvisual-spatial, verbal, or motor skills. Their third aim is to see if a testmeasuring musical perception before their training began correlates with any ofthe cognitive, motor, or neural outcomes associated with music training. Theirinitial screening showed there was no difference in the groups of childrenbefore beginning musical training. After the first fourteen months of study,preliminary results in five- to seven-year-old children suggest that cognitiveand brain effects from instrumental music training can be found. So far, theseeffects are small and are in areas that control fine motor skills and melodicdiscrimination.102Another researcher, John Jonides, at the University of Michigan, has beentesting musicians to see if they have better memories. It appears that they do,both long- and short-term memory in both visual and verbal tests. They arecurrently in the process of seeing if there is a close relationship betweenmusical training, musical skill, and memory.103For years, many people have thought musicians have greater mathematical skills.I would bet if you asked people on the street what cognitive advantage playingmusic gave to a person, this would be a very common answer. However, evidencefor this is sketchy. Elizabeth Spelke is in the midst of testing mathematicalabilities and music training in several different age groups. She has fourdifferent age groups: five to ten years, eight to thirteen, thirteen toeighteen, and adults. Preliminary results from those aged eight to thirteen showa significant advantage in geometric representation for the music-trainedchildren; other results are pending.> > CONCLUSIONIt seems that Tooby and Cosmides are right when they suggest that childrenshould be immersed in an aesthetically pleasing environment. But children arenot the only ones to benefit. Whether you are sitting in a mountain meadow orcatching alpine glow along the Seine, looking at a Bonnard or your own latesthandiwork, listening to Beethoven or Neil Young, watching Swan Lake or showingyour kids how to tango, reading Dickens or telling your own tall tale, art canput a smile on your face. We may be smiling because our cocky brain is pleasedwith itself, because it is fluently processing a stimulus, but you don’t need totell the artist that. The benefits to the individual and society from positiveaffect alone suggest that the world is a happier place if it is beautiful. Ithink the French figured this out a while back.The creation of art is new to the world of animals. It is now being recognizedthat this uniquely human contribution is firmly based in our biology. We sharesome perceptual processing abilities with other animals, and therefore we mayeven share what we call aesthetic preferences. But something more is going on inthe human brain—something that has allowed us to engage in pretense, as AlanLeslie suggests, some connectivity change that has allowed us to decouple thetrue from the imaginary and, as Tooby and Cosmides suggest, to use contingentlytrue information. This unique ability has enabled us to be very flexible andadaptable to different environments, to break out of the rigid behavioralpatterns that other animals are subject to. Our imaginative ability allowed oneof us thousands of years ago to look at a wall of an empty cave in France anddecide to spruce it up with a little fresco, another to tell the story of theodyssey of Ulysses, another to look at a chunk of marble and see David trappedinside, and another to look at a strip of bay-front property and envision theSydney Opera House. What caused this connectivity change is unknown. Was it dueto a change in the prefrontal cortex as a result of some small genetic mutation,or was it a more gradual process? No one knows. Did the increasinglateralization of brain function that we will read about in chapter 8 contributeto it? Maybe."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 [Human_split_003.html#filepos4557]"},{"pageContent":"WE ALL ACT LIKE DUALISTS: THE CONVERTER FUNCTION[Human_split_003.html#filepos4557]> > The centermost processes of the brain with which consciousness is presumably> > associated are simply not understood.

Sperry, quoted by Denis Brian in Genius Talk: Conversations with> > Nobel Scientists and Other LuminariesIN THE PERSONAL ADS IN THE DATING COLUMNS, WHEN PEOPLE will describe themselvesor the type of person they are looking for, there might be a quick physicaldescription such as “tall, brown eyes, brown hair, thin, athletic,” but then thewriter will launch into “humorous, clever, intelligent, and happy male lookingfor witty, charming, intelligent, caring, generous female,” or somethingsimilar. These descriptions don’t seem odd. It would seem odd if there were nodescription of the personality or character of either party, but instead thephysical description continued, “I have a 5 percent greater amount of graymatter than average, and my left planum temporale is larger than most. I havespent years increasing my intercerebral connectivity, to the point where mylatest scan rather stunned the radiographers. I am looking for someone with alarge cerebellum and hippocampus, and a well-connected amygdala. Please do notrespond if you have had any prefrontal lobe injuries.”Although perhaps some specialists could guess the characteristics that such abrain might endow on its person, it is not how we think about others. If you aretalking with a friend and tell him about your son, you don’t start with hisphysical description. You may say what a great kid he is and what his interestsare and whether he likes school or sports. Sure, you will probably pull out hispicture, but the conversation is not dead without it. You are talking about whatmakes him him. If you merely said, “Ah, let’s see, he has blond hair and isabout four eleven now, and he burns easily,” that would not tell us much abouthim except that he should use sunblock, and you would likely get somespeculative looks.There seem to be two parts of a person, the physical person (the body, includingthe brain), and then that other part, the part that makes you you and me me—theessence. Some call this the soul or spirit; others call it the mind. Together,these make up the classic mind/body duo. Philosophers have been discussing andarguing for literally thousands of years whether the mind and body are oneentity or are separate, with Descartes topping the charts championing the latterposition. Dualism is the belief that people are more than just bodies. This ideacomes so easily to us that we even believe it about other animals, especiallyour pets and any animal we consider cute.But you know what? We are not going to talk about whether the mind and body arethe same or separate in reality. We are going to talk about why most peoplebelieve they are separate and why even people who don’t believe they areseparate act as if they are separate. Why do we think of a person as being morethan just a body? Maybe in a conscious intellectual way, you can grasp the ideathat you are just a bunch of atoms and chemical reactions, but in everyday life,that is not how you interact. If someone cuts in front of you on the freeway,you don’t think, Gee, what an influx of catecholamines in that chunk of cells infront of me! No, you think, What makes him think he is so important that heshould get in front of me? What a jerk. And if you are standing on the rim ofthe Grand Canyon looking over the edge and get a rush of catecholaminesyourself, you don’t say, Whoa, I’ve got some palpitations going on. Greatcatecholamine surge. No, the chemical change produces a feeling that your brainis compelled to explain situationally. It takes into account all the input, andthen interprets the feeling and comes up with, Standing on the edge here makesme nervous.What happens in every instance of human life? We somehow reflexively convert rawinput, such as what we experience and see and feel, into another level oforganization. In physical terms, it is like a phase shift, like going from solidto liquid to gas. Each state has its rules, its references, its reality. So toofor the work of the brain. Mental states come with the brain, whether you wantthem or not. Our converter takes the input and delivers it to a neworganization. Our chore in this chapter and also in the next is to try tounderstand the converter functions, the system that makes us all dualists.Of course, we immediately want to know, Are we the only dualists? Is your cat adualist? Does your cat think that you are more than his person who feeds him?Does he separate the you that he sees and smells and hears and licks andscratches and bites to some incorporeal you?We are going to probe how the human brain forms beliefs, and what makes thebelief that we have a mind that is separate from the body so easy to latch onto. The systems our brain uses to form beliefs and the way our brain forms thebelief that we are dual are both central to the understanding of what makes usunique.As we have seen with other systems, belief formation comes in two flavors.Neuropsychologist Justin Barrett calls these two systems reflective andnonreflective.1 Nonreflective beliefs are fast and automatic. Sound familiar?These are such common thoughts that you may not even classify them as beliefs.You are sitting at the kitchen table having breakfast, still half asleep. Youknock your knife onto the floor. Do you believe the knife felt pain? Could theknife have just as easily hit the ceiling or passed through the floor into theground under the house? How about the floor; will it bleed? After you pick upthe knife, wash it off, and put it in the drawer, do you think it will mate withthe other knives? Will there be twice as many knives in the drawer in a fewdays? No. You don’t believe any of that, and you don’t even have to think aboutthose questions to give me an answer, even though you may never have thoughtabout any of them before.As you stare out the window at breakfast without your glasses on, you seesomething about the size of a softball come down out of the sky, land on thetree branch, and start making a tweeting noise. Do you believe it is breathing?Do you believe it gets hungry? Do you think it mates? Do you believe one day itwill die? Sure you do. Your brain has classified these two different items intotwo different categories. One was “a thing” and the other was “It’s alive!” Thenyour brain automatically inferred an entire list of properties that belong toeach category, beginning with “object, not alive” and “object, alive, animal.”This makes life much easier for us.You wouldn’t want to have to consciously go through a whole list of propertiesevery time you came across something you hadn’t seen before and have to learnthem each time. You would never get out of Home Depot. None of us would be here,because our ancestor would have been transfixed, staring at the lion and runningdown a list of alternatives still figuring out what it was that was flyingthrough the air toward his throat. Your brain has used its detection devices tofigure out the categories your perceptions fall into. You have an entiredetective agency working in your brain, made up of an object detection device,an animal identifier, an artifact identifier, and a “face detector,” all ofwhich answer the question, Who or what is that? You also have an agencydetection device, the detective that answers the question, What or who done it?You also have profilers working. Once the detective devices identify theculprit, the profilers infer information about it and describe it. Barrett callsthese profilers an animal describer, an object describer, a living thingdescriber, and an agent describer (also known as TOM). Each of these detectivesand profilers has some hardwired knowledge, and as you learn and experience theworld, this knowledge gets enhanced. All of these devices are part of theconverter function that leads to our moving things from one level or state intothe personal psychological state. How such devices actually work is notaltogether clear, and we will talk more about that in chapter 8. For now, let’ssee what is hardwired.> > INTUITIVE BIOLOGYHumans are natural-born taxonomists. We like to name and categorize all sorts ofobjects that surround us, and our brain automatically does this. A good rule ofthumb is, if a way of thinking comes easily to us, we probably have somecognitive mechanism that is set up to think in that way. Cognitiveanthropologist Scott Atran from the University of Michigan provides evidencethat in every human society people intuitively think about plants and animals inthe same special ways,2 which are different from how we think about objects,such as rocks or stars or chairs. An animate object is different from aninanimate object. The intuition that bestows animacy on an object is thehardwired knowledge that animate objects have, as Steven Pinker so wonderfullyrefers to it, “an internal and renewable source of oomph.”3 We classify plantsand animals into species-like groups and infer that each species has anunderlying causal nature, or essence, which is responsible for its appearanceand behavior.This essence is the nonperceptual attributes that make a wolf a wolf, even if itis in sheep’s clothing—for appearance is not always reality. We know that ahorse is still a horse, even if you paint zebra stripes on it. This belief orintuition is already present in preschool children. These kids will tell youthat if you change the innards, those invisible parts of dog, it no longer is adog, but if you change its appearance, it still is; and once you’re bornsomething, such as a cow, you will develop the nature and behavior of thatanimal, no matter if you were raised by pigs and never saw another cow.4 Theseclassification systems have a hierarchy. There are groups within groups: Amallard is a specific type of duck, which is a specific type of bird. Theclassification provides a framework for making inferences about the propertiesof the category.5 Some of the inferences are innate, some are learned. You tellme it’s a bird, I infer it has feathers and can fly. You tell me it’s a duck, Iinfer it has feathers, flies, quacks, and swims, and I may even infer that itsname is Donald. You tell me it’s a mallard, and I infer all that, plus the factthat it will be in my backyard in March. Intuitive biology refers to this wayour brains categorize living things.Harvard researchers Alfonso Caramazza and Jennifer Shelton claim that there aredomain-specific knowledge systems for animate and inanimate categories that havedistinct neural mechanisms. Indeed, there are patients with brain damage who arevery poor at recognizing animals but not man-made artifacts, and vice versa.6 Ifyou have a lesion in one spot, you can’t tell a tiger from an Airedale, and ifit is in another spot, the telephone becomes a mysterious object. There are evenpeople with brain lesions that make them specifically unable to recognize fruit.How do these systems work and come about? If an organism repeatedly comes acrossthe same situation, any individual that evolves a mechanism to understand orpredict the results of the situation is going to have a survival advantage.These domain-specific knowledge systems aren’t actually the knowledge itself,but systems that make you pay attention to particular aspects of situations thatwill increase your specific knowledge. Just how specific and what type ofinformation is encoded are not the same for every system, and there aredifferent opinions on how it is differentiated.Clark Barrett and Pascal Boyer suggest that the animal identification system maybe a bit more specific than the object system, especially for predators asopposed to prey animals.7 Within the domain of living things, there may be quitespecific detectors for certain classes of dangerous animals that were common inmany environments, such as snakes, and perhaps even big cats. A stable set ofvisual clues may be encoded in the brain, clues that make you pay attention tosuch things as sharp teeth, forward-facing eyes, body size and shape, andaspects of biological motion that are used as input to identify them.8 You don’thave innate knowledge that a tiger is a tiger, but you may have innate knowledgethat when you see a large stalking animal with forward-facing eyes and sharpteeth, it is a predator. Once you see a tiger, then you pop that into thepredator category along with whatever else you have already added.This domain specificity for predators is not limited to humans. Richard Coss andcolleagues at the University of California, Davis, have studied some squirrelsthat had been raised in isolation with no previous exposure to snakes. Whenexposed to snakes for the first time, they evaded them but did not evade othernovel objects. They concluded that these squirrels have an innate wariness ofsnakes. In fact, these researchers have been able to document that it takes tenthousand years of snake-free living for this “snake template” to disappear frompopulations.9 I am pretty sure I have a big fat snake template.Dan Blumstein and colleagues at UCLA have studied a group of tammar wallabiesliving on Kangaroo Island, off the coast of Australia, that have been naturallyisolated from all predators for the last 9,500 years. They presented thesewallabies with stuffed predators that were evolutionarily novel (ones theirancestors had never faced—a fox or cat), as well as a model of theirevolutionary, though now extinct, predator (no stuffed ones being available).The wallabies responded to the sight of both types: They stopped foraging andbecame more vigilant.10 They did not have these reactions to the control items.They were reacting to some visual cue that these stuffed or model predatorsexhibited, not to any behavior. Thus, it is possible for highly domain-specificmechanisms to exist, in this case for identification, ones that do not requireprior experience or social context to work. These mechanisms are innate andhard-wired. We share some with other animals, certain animals have some that wedon’t have, and some are uniquely human.Studying babies helps us identify what knowledge is hardwired in humans. In aprevious chapter, we learned that babies have categorizing domain-specificneural pathways to identify human faces and also to register biologicalmotion.11 There are a couple of other aspects of motion that interest babiesfrom about nine months of age and aid in identifying animate motion. Babiesunderstand when an object reacts to a distant event. For instance, if somethingfalls, whatever else moves that it did not contact is animate.12 They alsoexpect an animate object to move toward a goal in a rational way.13 So if anobject has to hop over an obstacle to get to a goal, they expect it not to hopif the obstacle is removed. Infants have even been shown to have specificexpectations about what objects that are chasing or evading will do.14 Thesestudies are all evidence that young infants have innate abilities to distinguishanimate from inanimate objects. So, once an object is observed with any of theseperceptual characteristics, the detective device surmises that it’s ALIVE, andthe brain automatically places it in the alive category and then infers a listof properties. The more life experience you have, the more you add to the listof properties that you infer. If none of these characteristics are observed, itwill be placed in the inanimate category, and a different set of properties willbe inferred. This is where the profilers come in.Infers properties? Yes! Automatically the brain bestows on the animate objectsome properties common to things that are alive. Then the object may be furthercategorized as an animal or even more specifically as a human or a predator, andeven more properties are inferred. Barrett and Boyer summarize the features ofthese inference systems for us,7 and some of their properties have specificbearing on our topic. 1. Each of the different domains deals with a different type of problem and has specific ways of handling information. Each has a specific input format, a specific way it infers information, and a specific output form. For instance, most psychologists will agree that humans have a special system to recognize human faces. The input format for face recognition is concerned with the overall arrangement and the relations of the parts to each other, rather than with specific parts. The input pattern that your brain looks for automatically consists of two brightly contrasted points (eyes) and a central opening (mouth) below. When the input format is not this way, for instance if you turn a picture upside down, faces are harder to recognize. 2. Just because there is a specialized domain for a specific problem, the domain does not necessarily correspond to reality. We see faces as the important aspect of a person because we have a system that pays particular attention to them. But are they really important? Not all animals have this system and see human faces as important. Neither now nor in the evolutionary environment would an impala need to know whether it was Pierre, Chuck, or Vinnie who was chasing it, or even that they are human; all it needs to know is that a predator is chasing it. The reality may be that there are fourteen different predator species that it needs to recognize, but it may recognize them all as only one species: an animal with eyes facing forward that runs. We could have evolved with a foot-recognition system instead, and it would be feet that we would gaze at lovingly and think were important. All you would have to do to be incognito would be to put on a pair of boots. The system does not necessarily recognize objects as wholes, but notices aspects of the object. For the face, there is a system to identify the person and a different system to identify their mood. One problem is that if there is an ambiguous aspect of an object, the system may infer the wrong information. There are two darkly contrasting points and a central opening over there in the dark. “Yikes! There is someone in those bushes!” No, it turns out to be a hubcap with holes in it. Another problem is that the system may infer scientifically incorrect information, although it is information that is mostly correct and has worked well enough so that it has been selected for. The system that identifies plants assumes that plants don’t move of their own volition. Some plants do, but they are rare, so it doesn’t affect the accuracy much. It is important for us to note, however, that the human brain does not divide living and nonliving things up the same way that a scientist would, based on verifiable information. 3. It is through the process of evolutionary selection that the specific system has arisen, so we need to keep in mind what the original function of the design was, because… 4. We may use a domain in ways other than the one it was selected for. For instance, our ears have evolved because they captured sound waves, which improved hearing, but we now also hang glasses from them. Bipedal locomotion was selected for because it gave some survival advantage in finding food and shelter, but we also use it for salsa dancing. The proper evolutionary use of a domain may be quite different from its current use. 5. You (and every other animal) can learn and infer only what your brain is programmed to be able to do. We cannot learn to hear sound frequencies beyond the range of our hearing, because our systems are not programmed to be able to. We can learn to speak because we have a domain that is ready to learn language. We cannot consciously feel what our brains are doing when they are performing unconscious processes. We can see three dimensionally even though a two-dimensional pattern falls onto our retina, because we have a specialized visual system that fills in the visual blanks. So where animals are concerned, because we have a brain that is predisposed to species-specific taxonomy, we are able to use all the incoming information, such as shape, color, sounds, motion, and behavior, to infer similarities and differences. 6. Different domains learn things in different ways and have different developmental schedules, so optimal learning takes place at specific times in development. We have seen that there is an optimal time in development to learn language. We will be talking about our intuitive knowledge of physics. This develops earlier in babies than a fully developed intuitive psychology. It develops earlier than children can speak, so we have had to figure out how to find this out without resorting to language. 7. Genetic influence continues throughout the life of an organism. It doesn’t stop at birth, and there are specific pathways that development follows, which are genetically encoded. All children everywhere follow the same general developmental time schedule, though there can be individual differences. Even if you are really really, really smart, you still don’t learn to speak when you are three months old. 8. In order to develop these systems, a normal environment is needed to input the proper stimuli. In order to learn to speak, one needs to hear others speak, just as songbirds need to hear other songbirds sing before they can sing. In order to develop proper vision, one needs visual input and can’t be raised in the dark. 9. These systems that infer information for survival and fitness are most likely interconnected, so that more than one area of the brain is activated when they are employed.Children from the age of three already infer that something that falls into theanimate category has some essence that makes it what it is and does not change.When shown pictures of slowly transforming animals, such as a porcupine turninginto a cactus, children will put their foot down at some point and tell you thatit doesn’t matter what you do to it, it is still a porcupine. Susan Gelman15 andher students at the University of Michigan wondered if this is information thathas been explained to them or if it is innate knowledge. They analyzed thousandsof mother-child conversations about “animals” and “things,” conversations fromseveral families that occurred over a period of several months. The insides ofsomething, what made it tick, and its origins were rarely discussed, and if theywere, the discussion usually involved things, not animals. Children are bornbelieving in essences; it is not something they are taught. Nine-month-oldbabies also already believe in the essence of objects. If you present them witha small box that makes a sound when you touch it in a particular place, theyexpect all identical small boxes to possess the same quality. Three-year-oldchildren will go a step further and infer that similar boxes have the samequality, even if they are not exactly the same.Using these examples, Yale psychologist Paul Bloom, in his fascinating bookDescartes’ Baby,16 tells us that children are natural believers in essentialism,the philosophical theory that a thing perceivable to the senses can have anembodied unobservable essence that is real. Bloom says essentialism in some formshows up in all cultures. This essence may take the form of DNA or a gift fromGod or your astrological sign or, as a Yoruba farmer will tell you, a “structurefrom heaven.” Bloom considers essentialism an adaptive way to think about thenatural world. Biologically, animals are similar because of a sharedevolutionary history. Although appearance has some relevance as to what group ananimal is in, more reliable indicators are deeper. So this inference thatanimals have an essence that does not change, even when the physical featuresdo, has validity and ratifies the innate dualism in children. The converter isat work.Do other animals have a concept of essences? Jennifer Vonk and Daniel Povinellidon’t think so.17 After reviewing studies that have been done to tease out howanimals categorize entities as either same or different, they have concludedthat all findings so far can be explained by other animals’ using solelyperceivable traits: appearance, behavioral patterns, odor, sound, and touch. Forother animals, appearance is reality.When you start trying to design experiments to separate perceivablerelationships from unobservable relationships, you realize it is quitedifficult, and you begin to understand that perceivable relationships will doquite well most of the time. In fact, they have proven to be very difficult todistinguish, and Vonk and Povinelli don’t think there is any good evidence thatanimals use more than perceivable characteristics. Their interpretation of thecurrent findings is that pigeons and monkeys can perceive first-orderrelationships: They have a concept that two things that share common perceptualcharacteristics are the same. The researchers emphasize that the key word hereis perceive, just as the Kangaroo Island wallabies perceived that the stuffedfox and cat were things they should be concerned about, because they sharedperceptual features that put them in the to-be-avoided class. Would a wallabyhave been fooled by sheep’s clothing? If all other perceivable clues wereeliminated, such as odor, type of movement and behavior, and sound, and the foxkept his mouth shut and wore a mask, probably. And you might have been, too. Butfoxes don’t actually dress up in sheep’s clothing.Appearances are good enough in the animal world unless the animals are dealingwith humans. Let’s just throw in an anecdotal tale. Apparently mountain lionscan be fooled! This from the California Department of Fish and Game Web site:“One incident involved a turkey hunter who was camouflaged and calling forturkeys when a mountain lion approached from behind. Immediately after themountain lion confronted the hunter and realized that the hunter was not aturkey, the lion ran away. This is not judged to be an attack on a human. Everyindication suggests that if the hunter had not been camouflaged and calling likea turkey, the mountain lion would have avoided him.”Understanding second-order relations means that one understands that therelationship between these two items is the same as the relationship betweenthose two items. Remember your verbal SATs? The analogy section? How well didyou do with those? There is evidence that the great apes are capable ofunderstanding some second-order relationships, but as yet there is no evidencethat they can do so with information other than what is observable. Even inchimpanzee social relationships, such as dominance or emotional relationshipslike love or attachment, all can be explained by observable phenomena. If thisdoesn’t make sense to you, then explain how you know that someone loves you.“Well, he kisses me good-bye every morning.” Perceivable. “He calls me from workevery day.” Perceivable. “She goes out of her way to do nice things for me.” Ah,perceivable. “She tells me she loves me.” Ah, that would be a ditto. Vonk andPovinelli point out that we may define love as feelings, an inwardmanifestation, but we describe its visible outward manifestations. You can’tactually feel another’s feelings, you infer them through perception, theobservation of their actions and facial expressions. We advise our friends inthe throes of infatuation, “Actions speak louder than words.” Your dog is loyalto the audible, visible, sniffable you, not the essence of you.> > INTUITIVE PHYSICSWe also have an intuitive knowledge of physics, although your physics grades maynot reflect it. Remember that the intuitive systems make us pay specialattention to things that have been helpful in survival. To survive, you didn’treally need an intuitive system to help you understand quantum mechanics or thefact that the earth is however many billions of years old. It is not so easy tograsp these concepts, and some of us never do. However, when you knocked theknife off the table at breakfast, there were many aspects of physics you didunconsciously take into account. You knew it would fall to the floor. You knewit would still be there when you leaned over to pick it up. You knew it would bedirectly beneath you and didn’t fly into the living room. You knew it wouldstill be a knife, that it had not morphed into a spoon or a lump of metal. Youalso knew it wouldn’t pass through the solid floor and end up under the house.Was all this knowledge learned through experience, or was it innate? Just as youunderstand these things, very young infants already understand these sameaspects of the physical world.How do we know? What if, instead of falling onto the floor, the knife had flownup to the ceiling? You would have been surprised. In fact, you would have staredup at that knife. Babies will do the same thing if they see somethingunexpected. They will stare.Babies expect objects to conform to a set of rules, and when they don’t, theywill stare at them. By five months of age, babies expect objects to bepermanent. They don’t just disappear when put out of sight.18 In a number ofexperiments, Elizabeth Spelke at Harvard and Renée Baillargeon at the Universityof Illinois have studied for years what babies know about physics. They haveshown that infants expect objects to be cohesive and to stay in one piece ratherthan spontaneously break apart if you pull on them. They also expect them tokeep the same shape if they pass behind a screen and reemerge. For example, aball shouldn’t turn into a cupcake. They expect things to move along continuouspaths and not to travel across gaps in space. And they make assumptions aboutpartially hidden shapes. They also expect an object not to move on its ownwithout something touching it, and to be solid and not to pass through anotherobject.19, 20 How do we know this isn’t learned knowledge? Because babieseverywhere know the same stuff at the same age no matter what they have beenexposed to.Babies do not understand everything about physical objects, however. It takesthem a while to understand the full implications of gravity. They understandthat an object can’t just be suspended in midair, but not until they are a yearold do they understand that an object must have support under its center ofgravity or it will fall.21 This is why the sippy cup was invented. Of course notall physical knowledge is innate. There is plenty that needs to be learned, andsome adults never learn some of it, hence your physics grade. To what extentother animals share our intuitive physics is not yet known. As Marc Hauser saysin his book Wild Minds, it seems inconceivable animals would not understandobject permanence. There would be no prey animals left if they didn’t understandthat the predator that walked behind the bush is still there and didn’tdisappear into thin air. However, there are some major differences in what weunderstand about physics and what other animals understand, and in how we usethe information.Povinelli and Vonk,17 having reviewed what is known about the physical knowledgeof nonhuman primates, suggest that although it is clear they can reason fromobserved events to resulting causes, they do not appreciate the causal forcesthat underlie their observations. For instance, if they understood the cause ofgravity, instead of knowing only by observation that fruit will fall to theground, then they should also understand that if they were reaching forsomething and dragged it across an open void, then it too would fall into thevoid. They can’t figure this out. They don’t understand force. They understandthat objects touch each other, which is observable, but they don’t get the ideathat in order for one object to move another, some force has to be transferred:A cup needs to be sitting on top of a tablecloth when the cloth is pulled inorder for the cup to move; it can’t just be touching the tablecloth. They justdon’t get it. This contrasts with two- and three-year-olds, who do get it.Children will prioritize the cause of simple events by an unobservable feature(the transfer of force) over an observable feature (for instance, proximity).22It has been proposed23, 24, 25 that humans are unique in their ability to reasonabout causal forces. Sure, some animals understand that an apple will fall off atree, but humans are the only animal that can reason about the invisiblecause—gravity—and how it works. Not that we all do.Our object taxonomy for physical objects, man-made artifacts in particular,works differently than our biological taxonomy. Artifacts are classified mostlyby function or intentional function,26 and are not hierarchically classifiedlike plants and animals. When something is classified as a man-made artifact,different inferences are made about it than about a living thing. It gets adifferent profile. In fact the identification and profiling systems can get evenmore specific. Motor regions of the brain activate when tools are the objects27and when the artifact is manipulable,28 but not with man-made objects ingeneral. We infer all the above physical properties, but not the properties weinfer for living things, except in special circumstances.After the detective device has answered What or who is that? or Who or what didthat? the information is sent to the describers, which infer all the propertiesof what has been identified. So back at breakfast when you looked out the windowand saw the flitting, softball-size what-or-who-is-that, the object detectiveidentified it as a physical object with a definite border rather than somethingformless, and, wait a minute…the object has initiated its own motion, abiological-type motion, so the detective device signals, “It’s alive!” Theanimal identifier chimes in with “Ah, it’s a bird.” Once it has been identified,the animal describer infers that it has all the properties of its class: Itwould have all the physical properties of an object in space, plus those of ananimal and those of a bird. This all happens automatically, even if you havenever seen that specific animal before. If the detective device says it’s a whoas opposed to a what problem, and identifies the quarry, then the agentdescriber or TOM is engaged. This is another area of intuitive knowledge, knownas intuitive psychology, which also contributes to our nonreflective beliefs.> > INTUITIVE PSYCHOLOGYWe use our theory-of-mind system (our intuitive understanding that others haveinvisible states—beliefs, desires, intentions, and goals—and that these cancause behaviors and events) to ascribe these same characteristics not only toother humans but also to the animate category in general, even though otheranimates do not possess it to the same degree humans do. (Sometimes it can alsoget sloppily slapped onto objects.) This is why it is so easy to think of ourpets and other animals as having thoughts and beliefs like our own and whyanthropomorphism is so easy to resort to. This is also why it can be so hard forhumans to accept that their psychology is unique. We are wired to thinkotherwise. We are wired to think animate objects have TOM. We think otheranimals, especially ones most similar to us, think as we do. Our intuitivepsychology does not limit the extent of TOM in other animals. In fact, whenpresented with films of geometric shapes moving in ways that suggest intentionor goal-directed behavior (moving in ways that an animal would move), peoplewill even attribute desires and intentions to geometric figures.29 Yes, otheranimals have desires and goals, but they are shaped by a body and a brain thathas answered survival and fitness problems with different solutions. We are notall hooked up the same.Anthropomorphism is not the only common type of thinking that has roots in TOM.If your biology teacher chastised you for that, perhaps you also had a big redmark for teleological thinking—explaining facts of nature as a result ofintelligent design or purpose. You were in trouble in biology class if you saidgiraffes have a long neck so they can eat the leaves of tall trees, that is,their neck was designed to reach the high leaves.*[Human_split_098.html#filepos1446613] However, this may actually be a defaultmode of thinking that is fully developed between ages four and five.Whereas both adults and children will resort to teleological explanations forbiological processes, such as that lungs are for breathing, children resort toteleological thinking for more diverse situations than adults do. They have abias to treat objects and behaviors of all kinds as existing for a designedpurpose.30, 31, 32 They will extend this reasoning to natural objects and willsay clouds are there to rain, mountains are there so you can go for a hike, andtigers exist for zoos.The origins of teleological thinking are still being hashed out. There are threeproposals. Either it is innate, or it comes from understanding that man-madeobjects are designed for a purpose,33 or it derives from the understanding ofrational action that babies exhibit and thus may be a precursor of TOM.34Teleological thinking explains a phenomenon by invoking an intended design.However, the fact we are even trying to explain an effect having been caused bysomething is also most probably a unique ability. Other animals do understandthat certain things are linked to other things in a causal manner. Your dog maylearn that chewing your Gucci shoes causes the effect of getting a swat, oryelled at, and he may learn that chewing his bone does not cause that effect.However, as we discussed with intuitive physics, there is no clear evidence thatother animals form concepts about imperceptible things. Your dog doesn’tunderstand that the unperceivable cause of the swat was the cost of the shoes oryour notions of dog obedience. Vonk and Povinelli17 have proposed that the humanability to reason about unobservable entities and processes goes beyond causalphysical forces and includes the psychological realm. This reasoning aboutunobservables can then be used to predict and explain events or psychologicalstates. Thus, once full-blown TOM developed, it greatly enhanced the ability topredict behavior beyond just observable phenomena. One could predict thebehavior of another animal by inferring its psychological state.While other animals and humans use observables to predict, it may be that humansalone also try to explain.35 Only one experiment so far has addressed thisnotion. Chimps and preschool children were given some blocks that they were tostand on a platform covered with an irregular mat. In the first experiment,among the blocks was one sham block that had had its ends beveled so it couldnot stand up. In the second experiment, the blocks were visibly identical (allL-shaped) and all of the same weight, but the sham block had been weighted sothat it could not stand up on its long axis. In the first experiment, both thechildren and the chimps examined the visibly different block. However, in thesecond experiment, in which the difference between the blocks was not visiblyperceptible, 61 percent of the children investigated the sham block to figureout why it couldn’t stand up, but none of the chimps did.36Sometimes our predilection for explaining the cause of things or behaviors withteleological thinking runs amuck. One of the reasons is that theagency-detection device is rather zealous. Barrett calls it hyperactive. Itlikes to drum up business, so it finds animate suspects even when there arenone. When you hear a sound in the middle of the night, the question that firstcomes to mind is Who is that? rather than What is that? When you see a wispysomething moving in the dark, Who is that? comes to mind because the detectivedevice is not modern and up-to-date. The detective device was forged manythousands of years ago before there were inanimate objects that could move ormake noise on their own. To first consider a potential danger as animate isadaptive. It worked most of the time. Those who did it survived and passed theirgenes to us.* [Human_split_099.html#filepos1447179] Sometimes blunders are made,but they usually aren’t much of a problem. We realize the wispy something is atowel someone left hanging in the tree, and the noise is the house creaking asthe temperature cools.The hyperactive detective device, combined with our need to explain andteleological thinking, is the basis of creationism. To explain why we exist, thehyperactive detection device says there must be a Who involved. Teleologicalreasoning says there must be an intentional design. The cause must be thedesires and intentions and behavior of the Who. Thus we were designed by a Who.All of this is reminiscent of what the left-brain interpreter would do, which ithas been demonstrated to do in other settings. In the next chapter, we will seeit become hyperactive in cases of neurologic disease when it produces seeminglybizarre stories of causality, given the bad information it receives. Theinterpreter and the theory-of-mind modules seem to be close cousins.Povinelli has suggested that TOM was “grafted” onto already existing cognitivesystems for reasoning about perceivable behavior, thus allowing humans toreinterpret already existing, complicated social behavior with the additionalability to think about mental states.37 TOM did not replace already existingsystems and is not necessarily always resorted to. The key point to this idea isthat it expects humans and their nearest living relatives, the great apes,especially chimps, to behave similarly, because being able to predict behaviorby observation had evolved before TOM. These systems for reasoning aboutbehavior were already highly sophisticated and complex, and they became closelyconnected to the TOM system. However, just because other animals may have someof the same behaviors that we do, inferring from this that they have the samecognitive system may not be correct. Also, just because we have a system to seekout cause from unobservables does not mean we use it all the time. It is unknownwhen our concepts about unobservables are activated and to what extent theyinform human behavior. It is possible that in many situations they are notactivated at all. It is also evident that not everyone possesses the ability touse TOM to the same extent.We will see in a moment that oftentimes we can come to the same conclusionswhether we use our TOM or not.> > OTHER DOMAINS PUT IN THEIR TWO CENTSMore-specialized domains come into play in specific circumstances when theprofiler doesn’t provide enough information, and many of these are involved insocial interactions. Some of these systems also act like statisticians andpredict human behavior or guide it under specific circumstances. We have alreadytalked about how some of these systems are active for social exchange,precautionary exchange, and the many moral intuitions that we have. There areprobably umpteen others, including one for math. Babies expect there to be twoMickeys behind a screen when they see one go behind it, and then one more.38Plus we have memory and our past experience to draw on. So now there is quite abit of information available.So at breakfast you gaze out the window and see an object move toward you andthen bend and straighten and move away from you. Your detective device hasidentified it as human, and even more specifically identified it as yourneighbor Luigi. Your animal describer tells you all Luigi’s properties,including TOM. Could you and your dog predict Luigi’s behavior correctly withouttaking TOM into account? If Luigi has been your neighbor for a few months, thenwhen you see him, you also remember that he came out yesterday morning andpicked up the paper, and the morning before that he did the same thing. Youcould actually predict his behavior without even using your TOM. Your dog alsohas seen Luigi come out each morning and bend over and pick up the paper.Everything looks the same as yesterday; your dog predicts the same behavior. Nowtry the same scenario using your TOM. Both you and your dog see the newspaperand see the front door open with Luigi on the threshold. Now you have an edge onyour dog. Your profiler has inferred that Luigi has TOM. You know he hasdesires, and you can use your intuitive psychology to predict ( just as if youwere he) that one of those desires is to read the paper. Yep, there he goes. Butthat was no different from what you and your dog predicted without TOM. TOM isan embellishment that is called in especially in human social interactions, forwhich we sometimes use it to predict behavior. But its most important functionallows you to understand that that hunk of cells over there has unobservablebeliefs and desires, just as you do, which are motivating it. The informationhas been automatically converted to give another status or state to Luigi.Intuitive psychology is a separate domain from intuitive biology and physics.This is important, because a desire or a belief doesn’t get tagged with physicalproperties, such as “has gravity” or “is solid,” or with biological properties,such as “eats” or “has sex” or, most important, “dies.” When Luigi comes out forhis paper, do you believe his desire is purple? Do you believe that it will fallout of his head when he leans over to pick up the paper? Do you believe that hisdesire is going to eat breakfast? No. You don’t believe any of that. Do youbelieve that his desire can pass through walls? Do you believe his desire candisappear into thin air? Do you believe that his desire can die? Does that meanit stops breathing? Now your responses may not be so quick. Your intuitivemechanisms are getting all flustered.> > THE GREAT DIVIDEThe divide between the domains is apparent in autism, in which the lack ofsocial understanding is a prominent feature, but it can also be associated withimpairments in imagination and communication. Children with autism rarely engagein imaginative playing, and many do not speak at all. It is thought thatindividuals with autism suffer from “mind-blindness.” They are blind to theunderstanding that other individuals have desires, beliefs, goals, andintentions—that they have a mind. Autistic children do not possess a theory ofmind; they lack an intuitive psychology. This lack of intuitive psychology iswhat makes social interactions so difficult. Instead of automatically knowingthat when you smile you are happy, or that your furrowed brow indicatesdispleasure, they have to learn and memorize what these expressions indicate andconsciously apply the lesson each time they see one. This lack of understandingalso explains other characteristics of children with autism, such as notpointing things out or looking to their parents for guidance. If they don’tunderstand that others have a mind, then there is no reason to show themsomething or look to them for advice. You don’t point the dust out to your broomor ask your dictionary for advice.When shown the films mentioned above, of the geometric figures exhibitingintentional action, autistic subjects merely give a physical description and donot ascribe intentions to them. The researchers give an example that is sodemonstrative of the difference, I will repeat it here.The first is a response from a normally developing adolescent describing theforms in the film: “What happened was that the larger triangle—which was like abigger kid or a bully—and he had isolated himself from everything else until twonew kids come along and the little one was a bit more shy, scared, and thesmaller triangle more like stood up for himself and protected the little one.The big triangle got jealous of them, came out, and started to pick on thesmaller triangle. The little triangle got upset and said like, ‘What’s up? Whyare you doing this?’”Contrast that response with the following from an autistic adolescent: “The bigtriangle went into the rectangle. There were a small triangle and a circle. Thebig triangle went out. The shapes bounce off each other. The small circle wentinside the rectangle. The big triangle was in the box with the circle. The smalltriangle and the circle went around each other a few times. They were kind ofoscillating around each other, maybe because of a magnetic field. After that,they go off the screen. The big triangle turned like a star—like a Star ofDavid—and broke the rectangle.”39Instead of bestowing social relationships on the geometric figures in the film,the autistic children described solely physical relationships. Multiple MRIstudies have been done in order to understand how the brain is different inautistic individuals. Of importance to our discussion is that when autisticindividuals looked at faces, the activity was significantly lower down in aregion of the brain called the fusiform gyrus, widely accepted to be specializedfor the perception of faces.40, 41 The autistic groups showed greater activationin adjacent regions of the temporal cortex that are usually associated withobjects. Indeed autistic children often treat other people as objects. Otherpeople can be terrifying to autistic individuals because they do not act likeobjects; they move and do things that are unpredictable according to theirnonreflective intuitive beliefs of how objects should act.> > DUALITY OF EXPERIENCEPaul Bloom, who contends people are natural-born dualists, states that inindividuals who do not have autism, this processing of object understandingseparate from social and psychological understanding is what gives rise to our“duality of experience.” Objects, the material, physical things of the world,are treated separately and differently from the nonvisible psychological statesof goals, beliefs, intentions, and desires. Different inferences are made. Partof that physical world is what you can look down and see: your body, thatphysical biological object that eats and sleeps and walks and has sex and dies.But the psychological part is not visible; it does not have an obvious physicalsubstance and is subject to different processing and inferences. It is not aphysical biological object subject to that same array of inferences. You have anonreflective intuitive belief that the body and its conscious essence areseparate.This intuitive belief in separateness allows you to be able to consider allsorts of situations without getting a brain ache, as you would if I started toexplain quantum physics. When Susie says, “If I could just be a fly on the wallin that office for an hour!” you immediately know she wants to be a physical flybut retain her own mind. The fly would not only have a desire and intention, itwould have her desire and goal and intention to listen to what was being said.You can easily separate her physical self from her mind and put her mind intothe fly. A real fly would have no such state, but the idea is easy tocomprehend. You also don’t hear someone saying, “If I could just be a wall foran hour!” because it is less likely for your intuitive psychology to assign aninanimate object, a wall, the ability to have desires and goals.Because you can mentally separate the physical body from the invisible essenceof a person, you can conceive that either one could exist separately. Thephysical body without the essence is a zombie, a robot; the invisible essencewithout the body is the soul or spirit. We can conceive of other essences orinvisible agents without a physical body that have desires or intentions, suchas ghosts, spirits, angels, demons or the devil, and gods or God. It wouldfollow from Povinelli’s reasoning, then, if animals cannot form concepts ofimperceptible entities or processes, if they do not possess a full TOM, thenthey cannot be dualists nor entertain the notion of spirits of any sort. Theseare uniquely human qualities. But what about the stories of elephants visitingtheir dead relatives? Doesn’t that mean that they have some notions of essences?> > ARE WE THE ONLY DUALISTS?The search for evidence of dualism in the animal world has centered on how aspecies treats their dead. Humans attach great importance to dead bodies, andtheir observable ritualistic behavior associated with the dead is visualindication of dualism at work. Although Neanderthals occasionally buried theirdead, Cro-Magnons (the first anatomically modern Homo sapiens who appeared inEurope, about forty thousand years ago) regularly and elaborately did, interringwith them material objects. This indicates a belief in an afterlife where suchitems were assumed to be useful.42 A belief in an afterlife assumes that thereis a difference between the physical body that is buried in the ground and whatcontinues to live on. The Cro-Magnons were dualists.So, do other animals show an elaborate response to their dead relatives orcompanions? Most animals do not. Lions appear to be practical. They may brieflysniff or lick the body of a recently dead buddy, and then tuck in to it for aquick meal. Chimps may have longer interactions with a dead social partner, butthey abandon the body once it starts getting a little whiffy.43 However,elephants have been observed to behave quite differently. Cynthia Moss, whostarted the Amboseli Elephant Research Project at Amboseli National Park inKenya, has studied African elephant family structure, life cycle, and behavior.In her book Elephant Memories, she wrote:> Unlike other animals, elephants recognize one of their own carcasses or> skeletons…when they come upon an elephant carcass they stop and become quiet> and yet tense in a different way from anything I have seen in other> situations. First they reach their trunks toward the body to smell it, and> then they approach slowly and cautiously and begin to touch the bones…they run> their trunk tips along the tusks and lower jaw and feel in all the crevices> and hollows in the skull. I would guess they are trying to recognize the> individual.Although the reports of elephant graveyards had been exposed as myths,43 Mossand other researchers suggested that they visited the dead bones of theirrelatives.44But did they? Did they visit or recognize dead individuals? Karen McComb andLucy Baker, from the University of Sussex, United Kingdom, joined Moss to studythis question experimentally. In one experiment, they set out an elephant skull,a piece of ivory, and a piece of wood. They found the elephants were veryinterested in the ivory, and were also somewhat interested in the elephantskull, but not the wood. In another experiment, the researchers found that theywere more interested in an elephant skull than in the skull of a buffalo or arhino. In their last experiment, they found that the elephants showed nopreference for the skull of their own matriarch over the skulls of matriarchsfrom other clans.43 What does this tell us? It tells us that elephants are veryinterested in ivory and are more interested in the bones of their own speciesthan those of others, but not specifically the bones of a relative. What thesignificance of this preference is, both evolutionarily and behaviorally, iscurrently unknown, but it cannot be taken for evidence that elephants have aninterest in their conspecifics beyond the physical. Whether there are otherspecies that practice a similar behavior still needs to be checked out.> > REFLECTIVE BELIEFSAfter all this incoming information from the senses has been selectively pickedapart and processed by various intuitive systems and your memory, some of itcomes bubbling into your conscious mind. How that happens is still the bigmystery. Once the info hits the conscious mind, the interpreter comes in—Mr.Know-it-all, who puts the info together and makes sense out of it. All thisdetecting, profiling, and predicting is done automatically. It is quick andfast, and usually correct. However, it is not always correct. Sometimes thedetective gets it wrong—for instance, when you hear the rustle in the bushes andjump because your “who or what did that?” detective goofed and told you it wasan animal that caused the noise instead of the wind. That’s OK. It is better tobe fast and sometimes wrong than slow and mostly right. Or maybe your detectivegoofed and identified your computer as alive because it did something all byitself (that you couldn’t possibly have caused) and so your profiler gave ittheory of mind. Now you believe that it has desires causing its behavior, andthe interpreter has to make sense of this, so it comes up with: Your computer isout to get you! All this is your automatic nonreflective belief system at work,fed by information from different domains.But just because you can imagine something does not mean it is true. You canimagine a unicorn, a satyr, and a talking mouse. Just because you believesomething does not mean that it is true. Just because you believe or imaginethat the mind and body are separate does not mean they are. So, what happens nowwhen I pose a problem to you that challenges your nonreflective beliefs? If youbelieve that the mind and body are separate, that you have a soul that is morethan just your brain cells and chemicals, then how do you explain personalitychanges, consciousness changes, or any of the changes that occur with brainlesions? What about Phineas Gage, who after his brain injury was described as nolonger the same person? His essence was different because of a physical changein his brain. Now you have to think this over and decide if you are going tochange your mind or not.Reflective beliefs are different and are probably what most people mean whenthey say they believe something. Reflective beliefs make up opinions andpreferences. They are not fast and automatic but are conscious and take time toform, and may or may not agree with nonreflective beliefs. After you weigh theinformation, look at the evidence, and consider the pros and cons, you come to adecision whether to believe something or not. Yeah, sure, we learned in chapter4 just how far in depth most people will go in this endeavor and how difficultit is to form rational judgments. Reflective beliefs are the same. Just as withmoral judgments, they too are usually arrived at with a minimum of reflection.Both reflective and nonreflective beliefs can be either true or false, and mayor may not be provable or justifiable.The interesting difference between these two types of belief systems is how totell which is in effect. Usually, if the automatic nonreflective, nonconsciousbelief system is in effect, you can tell by the person’s behavior, whereas thebest evidence for a conscious belief system is verbal statements, which may ormay not be consistent with his or her behavior. You still walk faster by thecemetery at night even though you say you don’t believe in ghosts. You still actas if we are talking to a mind rather than a bunch of cells and chemicals, evenif you think there is no difference between a brain and a mind, a body and asoul.Barrett tells us how nonreflective beliefs affect reflective ones. To beginwith, nonreflective beliefs are the default mode. If you have never beenpresented with a situation in which you must question your nonreflective belief,then that is what you will believe. It is not until you learn about Venusflytraps that you will change your intuitive belief that plants are notcarnivorous, and it is not until you learn about the sensitive plant that youwill change your belief that plants don’t move on their own. Your intuitivebeliefs are best guesses. These two types of plants are rare, so your best guessthat plants aren’t carnivores and don’t move will serve you well. This is mucheasier than holding a piece of ham in front of every new plant you see todetermine if it is a carnivore.Next, the better a reflective belief merges with a nonreflective belief, themore plausible it seems, the more intuitive and the easier to learn or accept.If I tell you a table is a solid object that doesn’t move, that accords withyour intuitive beliefs about objects that are not alive. That is easy tobelieve. However, if a physicist tells you that no objects are solid but arejust a bunch of atoms moving around, that is difficult to believe. Just as whenarriving at moral judgments, if the reflective belief verifies how you alreadysee the world, it is more readily accepted. The other way that nonreflectivebeliefs influence reflective ones is that they shape memory and experience. Whenyou form a memory, first you have perceived something. Zip, the perception getsfunneled through your detectives and profilers, all picking out and editing theinfo. The interpreter puts it all together in a summary that makes sense andfiles it away in memory. It has already been edited by your nonreflective beliefsystem, and you are now calling on it as true information to use for forming areflective belief. This information may be totally wrong, and is the same asusing anecdotal evidence to form a moral judgment in which you may attribute thewrong cause to the effect. Not only that, once you form a reflective beliefbased on this information, then that reflective belief, if it meshes withanother reflective belief, will be even stronger or will supply strength foranother reflective belief.If my friend tells me she is afraid of heights and asks me if I am, in order toanswer I may remember standing at the edge of the Grand Canyon and getting thecatecholamine rush that gave me a feeling of fear. My brain interpreted thisfeeling as being caused by standing on the rim of the canyon, but its actualcause was the catecholamine rush. In fact, it may not have been standing on therim that gave me the rush; it may have been a memory of falling off a ladderthat occurred to me as I leaned out over the canyon. The actual reason for therush is not what you become aware of; it is your brain’s interpretation of therush. It may not be the correct interpretation, but it will fit thecircumstances. Now you have a false belief. You think the feeling of fear wascaused by standing on the rim of the canyon. This false belief can now be usedin the future when you consciously reflect about heights. You will remember thatyou were scared standing there, and this memory may cause you to stay away fromhigh places and form the reflective belief that you are afraid of heights.Reflective beliefs need more time. If I force you to respond to a questionwithin a few seconds, you will be more likely to respond with your nonreflectivebelief.45So in the rare event when we are being “deep” because a default nonreflectivebelief hasn’t presented itself, or for some reason we are questioning anautomatic belief, and we actually are spending time pondering to form what we soblithely think of as an informed belief, much of the information that we usefrom memories and past experience is highly colored by our nonreflectiveintuitive beliefs, and some of it can be wrong. It is very difficult to separatethe intuitive from the verifiable, even though that is what we think we aredoing. It would be like doing a math problem that involves several steps, andgetting the first step’s answer wrong but being quite sure it was correct, andusing it to complete the rest of the problem. And don’t forget how emotion getsto be part of the process. What a mess!Luckily, the whole process has been refined to enhance fitness and survival, andusually it gets things right enough, but not always. Or I should say it gotthings right enough in the evolutionary environment. To separate the verifiablefrom the nonverifiable is a conscious, tedious process that most people areunwilling or unable to do. It takes energy and perseverance and training. It canbe counterintuitive. It is called analytical thinking. It is not common and isdifficult to do. It can even be expensive. It is what science is all about. Itis uniquely human.So we have this generally well-run system that sometimes makes errors, and theseerrors can lead to some mistaken beliefs. As the old adage goes, “Actions speaklouder than words.” Our actions tend to reflect our automatic intuitive thinkingor beliefs. We are dualists because our brain processes have been selected overtime to organize the world in specific categories and assign differentproperties to these categories. It just so happens we ourselves fall into twoseparate categories whose properties are different. We are animate objects,which are subject to the physical laws of animate objects, but we also havenonperceptual psychological properties not subject to physical laws. No problem!We’ll take a little of this and a little of that and voilà: a physicalbiological body and an unobservable psychological essence, two things in one. AsDescartes would have said, “Pas de probléme!”> > CONCLUSIONWe have seen that both we and other animals share some highly domain-specificabilities, such as spooking at snakes and recognizing other predator animals. Wealso share some of our intuitive physics with other animals, such as objectpermanence and gravity, and as we have seen in previous chapters, somerudimentary intuitive psychology (TOM). However, species differ in their domainspecificities. Unlike other animals, we humans have an expanded intuitiveunderstanding of physics. We understand that there are invisible forces. Currentevidence suggests that we are the only animals that reason about unobservableforces. We alone form concepts about imperceptible things and try to explain aneffect as having been caused by something. We also use these same abilities ofreasoning about and explaining imperceptible things in the biological andpsychological arenas. We understand that other living things have an invisibleessence that is independent of their appearance, although we may get carriedaway with just what this essence is. This questioning and reasoning aboutimperceptible forces is a hugely significant ability. It certainly sparked thecuriosity that, when coupled with conscious analytical thinking, has been thecornerstone of science, but that same curiosity has led to other, less rigorousways of explaining imperceptible forces, such as myths, junk science, and urbanlegends."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8 [Human_split_003.html#filepos4864]"},{"pageContent":"IS ANYBODY THERE?

This isn’t a story about college bull sessions dealing with themeaning of life. This is a story about my being fascinated with my collegebuddies. You see, I was a member of the fabled Animal House at DartmouthCollege, and I was Giraffe. What a ride that was.Actually, I was pretty square until Green Key Weekend of my junior year. I had adeal with my father. No booze until twenty-one and he would write me a check forfive hundred bucks. But my frat brothers told me a great drink was grapefruitjuice and vodka. So, emboldened with the idea of the moment, I dove into myfirst drink. It was a hot day, and about five drinks later, I declared therewasn’t much to this drinking thing, stood up from the sofa, took one step, andpassed out.Of course, the real lesson was about changing the normal conscious state of atwenty-year-old. Why do we love to change our consciousness, our appreciationand feelings about the world around us? We drink, we smoke, we do lattes, weseek painkillers, we may even get runner’s high. We are always tampering with anaspect of our existence we still can’t define: phenomenal conscious experience.Consciousness comes in many flavors. Anyone who has taught an introductorycollege class, or attended one at eight o’clock Friday morning, has seen themall. There may be a couple of party-hearty frat boys in the back row, dozingafter a long night spent celebrating the upcoming weekend. These two are notconscious. Up a couple of rows is the scammer checking out the hot babe acrossthe aisle and wondering if he can get a date. He is conscious, but not of you;nor are the three girls down the way who are passing notes to each other andsuppressing their merriment. Another has a tape recorder going and is finishingup a paper for another class, and will be conscious of you later. The front-rowkids are sippin’ their coffee, taking notes furiously and occasionally noddingin agreement; at least they are conscious of you. Although most people don’t sitaround and ponder the question of consciousness, they talk about it a lot. Afterclass you may overhear: “I finally realized [was conscious of ] what a jerk hewas, like, he totally didn’t even pay any attention to what I was saying and wasonly conscious of the sports channel. Great if you are into football stats, butif you want him to [be conscious of and] remember your birthday, forget aboutit. I, like, totally dumped him.”We have talked a lot about two aspects of brain function: the nonconsciousgoings on and the conscious goings on, the latter being what researcher MichaelPosner at the University of Oregon calls alertness. We have already seen that aconsiderable amount of processing, one might even want to say most of it, occurswithout our being aware of it: undercover. It hasn’t been easy figuring out thecontent of all the nonconscious goings on that have been elucidated so far, forthe simple reason that it doesn’t bubble up to our consciousness. Researchershave had to devise tricky experiments to reveal their presence.This might lead one to think that studying consciousness may be a little easier.Yet, as French neuroscientists Stan Dehaene and Lionel Naccache point out, theobject of our study is now introspective and not an objectively measurableresponse.1 Oddly enough, subjective reports of introspection themselves give ussome clues. My studies with split-brain patients have revealed thatintrospection can be wrong.2 We actually unwittingly make up stories to fit theobservable phenomenon, but this very fact is also a clue, which we will lookinto a bit later. Our very dualistic nature has also been a stumbling block onthe road to unlocking the mechanisms of consciousness.3 There are those who feelthat the essence of consciousness cannot have a physical explanation, that it isso wondrous that it can’t be explained by modules and neurons and synapses andneurotransmitters. We will soldier on without them. There are others who thinkthat it can be. I find that being able to explain consciousness with modules,neurons, synapses, and neurotransmitters is even more wondrous and fascinating.It may not be glamorous and transcendent, but it sure is captivating.> > THE UNSOLVED MYSTERYOne of the mysteries of consciousness is how a perception or information entersinto consciousness from the nonconscious depths. Is there a gatekeeper that letsonly some information through? What information is allowed through? Whatdetermines that? What happens after that? How do new ideas form? What processesare contributing to consciousness? Are all animals equally conscious or arethere degrees of consciousness? Is our consciousness unique? The question ofconsciousness has been rather like the holy grail of neuroscience. If you tellme you are interested in knowing just exactly what parts of the brain are activewhen you are conscious of something—a flower, a thought, a song—what you areasking about is known as the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC). You arenot the lone coyote on this quest. No one knows exactly what is going on, butthere are plenty of suggestions. So let’s see how many of those questions havebeen answered and what the theories are about the rest.Many researchers have proposed definitions and criteria for different levels ofconsciousness, to the point where it has gotten rather confusing.4, 5Progressive levels of consciousness are commonly named unconsciousness,consciousness, self-awareness, and meta-self-awareness, which means you knowthat you are self-aware.Antonio Damasio6 takes out his scalpel and slices consciousness down evenfurther to only two choices: core consciousness and extended consciousness. Coreconsciousness is what goes on when the on-off switch is flipped on and anorganism is awake and aware of one moment, now, and one place, here. It is alertand not concerned with the future or the past. This consciousness is not awareof self and is not uniquely human. It is, however, the foundation that isnecessary to build increasingly complex levels of consciousness, which Damasiocalls extended consciousness. Extended consciousness is what we normally thinkof when we think of being conscious. Extended consciousness is complex and ismade up of many levels. For instance, one level of consciousness is being awareof one’s surroundings and the chocolate cake on the table. Another is beingaware of them and knowing they are different from yesterday and may be differenttomorrow. (The cake wasn’t there yesterday, and most likely will be gonetomorrow, so dig in now!) These aspects of consciousness have to do withcontent, the components of conscious experience. The highest level is knowingthat one is aware of one’s surroundings and, I might add, what that cake will doto your waistline, and caring. I know for sure that dogs do not care about theirwaistlines. This involves the autobiographical self.What we want to know is whether there is a systematic way that informationprocessing reaches consciousness, and if so, what it is, how it works, and whataspects of this system may be uniquely human. To figure this out, we are goingto start with some rough neuroanatomy, including what has been learned frompersons with different brain lesions and from neuroimaging studies. Then we aregoing to look at some theories.> > THE PHYSICAL BASIS OF CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCEFirst, we need to know what brain areas are needed for core consciousness—the“on” switch. It begins in the brain stem. The brain stem*[Human_split_100.html#filepos1448183] is the lower part of the brain,structurally continuous with the spinal cord, the first station on the way tothe cortex. It is a structure that is evolutionarily old. All vertebrate animalshave a brain stem, but they are not all made up of the same types of neurons.The brain stem is a complicated place. It is like all those subbasements inskyscrapers, full of pipes, vents, wires, and gauges, which are connected to therest of the building. They keep everything running smoothly, but no one up onthe thirty-fourth floor even thinks about them. If you were to disconnect someof the wiring, then the thirty-fourth floor would know something was amiss,whether it was the lights, the AC, or the telephones. If you were to disconnectall the wires, everything would shut down.Just like the guy on the thirty-fourth floor, you have no idea what is going onin your brain stem. You are not conscious that different groups of neurons,known as nuclei, are relaying signals from your entire body related to thecurrent state of your guts, heart, lung, balance, and musculoskeletal frame toparts of the brain higher up, with connections that are both sending andreceiving information in the form of impulses. The main job of these brain-stemnuclei is the homeostatic regulation of both body and brain. They arefundamental for cardiovascular, respiratory, and intestinal control. Disconnectthe brain stem, and the body dies. This is true for all mammals.These groups of neurons have their dendrites in many pies. Some are required forconsciousness, and those are connected with the intralaminar nuclei (ILN) of thethalamus. Others are required to modulate consciousness, like a rheostat; theymake up part of the arousal system. These are connected to the basal forebrain,†[Human_split_101.html#filepos1448746] the hypothalamus, and directly to thecortex.7 Our party-hearty boys are not irreversibly unconscious. We can pinchthem or throw cold water on them, and they will wake up. Their consciousness wasbeing modulated by the arousal system via the connections that pass on to thebasal forebrain and the hypothalamus.Core consciousness is the first step to extended consciousness. If the wiringfor core consciousness is disconnected, the pinch or the cold water will notbring anyone back to wakefulness. This is where the neurons that connect thebrain stem with the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus are the stars. There aretwo ILNs in the thalamus, one in the right side and one in the left. Thethalamus itself is about the size of a walnut and sits astride the midline,smack dab in the center of the brain. Small, strategically placed bilaterallesions to the ILN in the thalamus turn consciousness off forever, although alesion in one alone will not.8 If the ILNs of the thalamus don’t get their inputfrom the connections to the brain stem, they are likewise kaput. So we have thefirst step on the road to consciousness: The connection of the brain stem to thethalamus must be active, and at least one of the ILNs must be up and running.Where do the pathways from the brain stem go beyond the ILNs? Wherever they go,some must be involved with consciousness also. Now the thalamus, of which theILNs are a part, is a well-connected dude. Neuronal connections link it tospecific regions all over the cortex, and those regions send connectionsstraight back to the thalamus. It has connection loops, which will becomeimportant a little later on in our discussion. The ILNs themselves connect tothe anterior portion of the cingulate cortex. Lesions anywhere from the brainstem to the cingulate cortex can disrupt core consciousness.It appears that the cingulate cortex is where core consciousness and extendedconsciousness overlap. The cingulate cortex sits on top of the corpus callosum,the great bundle of neurons that connects the right and left hemispheres.Damasio reports that patients with lesions in their cingulate cortex havedisruptions in both core and extended consciousness, but oftentimes can recovercore consciousness.Well then, if the cingulate cortex is involved with extended consciousness, isit well connected too? During the performance of conscious tasks, connectionsfrom the cingulate cortex to brain areas supporting the five neural networks formemory, perception, motor action, evaluation, and attention activate. Somethingelse is happening, too. While engaging in a wide assortment of conscious tasksthat require different types of brain activity, another area of the brain alsois always activated, along with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). That wasthe dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). And it is no coincidence thatthese two areas have reciprocal connections—more loops. Moreover, in the ACCthere is a particular type of long-distance spindle cell that is present only inthe great apes.9 And, as you may have guessed, the dlPFC is also a hotbed ofconnections to the same five neural networks mentioned above.*[Human_split_102.html#filepos1450045] Way back in chapter 1, we discussed thedifferent layers of the cortex. These long-distance neurons originate mostlyfrom the pyramidal cells of layers II and III. These layers are actually thickerin the dlPFC and inferior parietal cortex.> > Extended Consciousness and ModularityWe are now getting to areas in the brain that are more specialized. If theybecome damaged, the result is the loss of a specific ability, not con sciousnessitself. Throughout this book, there has been much talk about modules in thebrain and how each has its specific contribution. The idea of a module ofneurons dedicated for such specific duties such as reciprocity or cheaterdetection is fascinating, and the modularity of the brain becomes even moreapparent when lesions in the same specific part of different brains cause thesame specific deficit, such as the inability to recognize familiar faces. Theodd thing is, we don’t feel that fractionated. That is one of the reasons why wefind these modules so fascinating (and why the very idea of a modular brain canbe difficult to believe). “My brain is doing that? Crazy!” No, you didn’t haveany idea, because these modules are all working automatically, under cover,below the level of consciousness. For instance, if certain stimuli trick yourvisual system into constructing an illusion, consciously knowing that you havebeen tricked does not make the illusion disappear. That part of the visualsystem is not accessible to conscious control. We need to remember that all thatnonconscious stuff is also contributing to and shaping what comes to theconscious surface. Another thing to keep in mind is that some stuff just cannotbe processed nonconsciously. Unfortunately, your high school trig exam may havebeen an early reminder of this.If consciousness requires the input of several modules, then the other problemwe have to remember is connectivity. We learned in the first chapter that thereare only a limited number of connections per neuron, and the more modules thereare, the less they are interconnected. Even keeping this in mind, the sheernumber of neurons and their connections, ah, well, boggles the mind. The humanbrain has approximately one hundred billion neurons, and each, on average,connects to about one thousand other neurons. A quick little consciousmultiplication reveals that there are one hundred trillion synapticalconnections. So how is all this input getting spliced and integrated into acoherent package? To put it anthropomorphically, how does one module know whatall the other ones are doing? Or does it? How do we get order out of this chaosof connections? Even though it may not always seem so, our consciousness israther kicked back and relaxed when you think about all the input with which thebrain is being bombarded and all the processing that is going on. In fact, it isas if our consciousness is out on the golf course like the CEO of a big companywhile all the underlings are working. It occasionally listens to some chatter,makes a decision, and then is out sunning itself. Ah…is that why they call sometypes of brain processing executive functions?*[Human_split_103.html#filepos1450481]> > Beyond ModularityThe modular crowd recognizes that not all mental activities can be explained bymodules. Sometimes you have to step out of that cubicle and communicate withother cubicles. At some point along the processing route, the input from themodules needs to be synthesized, spliced together, and packaged—or ignored,suppressed, and inhibited. Here is the big mystery. How does it happen? Somecontrolled processing is going on, and there must be a mechanism that supportsflexible links among these processing modules. Many theoretical models of thismechanism have been proposed, including the central executive,10 the supervisoryattention system,11 the anterior attention system,12, 13 the global workspace,14and the dynamic core.15What processes need to be brought together? There are certain components tohuman consciousness, which we can figure out simply by thinking about whatgeneral mental tools we are using. By doing this we are accessing ourconsciousness and are able to identify what we are conscious of. Let’s justpretend you are still conscious while reading this paragraph, and I haven’tflipped your arousal switch off. Or maybe your mind has begun to wander,wondering where you should go on vacation next summer or what color to paint thekitchen. Your conscious thoughts require some form of attention, either to thesewords or visions of the Côte d’Azur. You may be using short-term memory (workingmemory) to keep track of what you have read, or long-term memory to call intomind past vacations or the color of your friend’s kitchen. You also are usingyour visual perceptions and language ability while reading this, and most likelywhile you are formulating your presentation of sun-drenched afternoons sippingpastis. You may be silently talking to yourself (known as inner speech), listingthe reasons why this vacation is a good idea. Not only is all that contributingto your consciousness, but so are your emotions and desires. Once all thesemechanisms are running, you end up being able to reason about what I havewritten and fit it in with what you already know, or to figure out how to talkyour spouse into renting that villa. The good thing is, you are not thinkingabout your income taxes or picking up your dry cleaning…uh-oh, now you are. Thatis an example of top-down attention.There are two phenomena we have to explain. One is that we feel like smoothlyrunning, coherently thinking beings who are usually in control of our thoughts.We usually don’t feel like police dispatchers with reports coming in fromhundreds or thousands of different sources, deciding what is important or usefulor not, or like triage nurses lining up incoming information in order of itsimportance, but somehow this is happening in our brains. Look around the roomyou are in and then close your eyes. Was it dusty? How many pencils and penswere on the table or desk? Were there any birds or flowers out the window? Howabout any dust on the screen? How many other books were in the room? Who wrotethem? All this information is going in through your eyes, being perceived andprocessed and sorted unconsciously, but it is not all making it up to the levelof consciousness (luckily) until you direct your attention to it. We also haveto explain how we come out with a feeling of ourselves, with our ownautobiography; and why, although our consciousness changes from minute tominute, our conscious sense of self does not. Somehow, information is beingintegrated into a nice package.> > THE GATEKEEPER TO CONSCIOUSNESS: ATTENTIONOnly certain information makes it through to consciousness. It is a dog-eat-dogworld in our brains. Experiments have shown that in order for a stimulus toreach consciousness, it needs a minimal amount of time to be present, and itneeds to have a certain degree of clarity. However, this is not quite enough.The stimulus has to have an interaction with the attentional state of theobserver. This can occur in two ways, which are referred to as either top-downor bottom-up processing. Just exactly what is going on here is not known, butStan Dehaene, Jean-Paul Changeux, a neuroscientist at the Pasteur Institute inParis, and various collaborators suggest that the top-down mode, when youconsciously direct your attention, may be a result of activity in thethalamocortical neurons, those loops that I mentioned earlier. In the bottom-upmode, they suggest, the sensory signals coming from nonconscious activity haveso much strength that they can reorient top-down amplification to themselves.16This is when your attention may be captured without conscious control. Forexample, you may be concentrating on a project at work, when all of a sudden yourealize you are hearing the fire alarm.You should note here an important point: Attention and consciousness are twoseparate animals. First off, cortical processors control the orientation ofattention. Although there may be top-down voluntary control, there may also bebottom-up nonconscious signals of such strength that they can co-opt attention.We experience this all the time. You may be consciously thinking about theproject that you are working on, when off go your thoughts to somewhere else,seemingly beyond your control. Second, although attention may be present, it maynot be enough for a stimulus to make it to consciousness.17 You are reading thatarticle about string theory, your eyes are focused, you are mouthing the wordsto yourself, and none of it is making it to your conscious brain, and maybe itnever will.> > SELECTIVE DISRUPTIONS OF CONSCIOUSNESSBrain lesions in the parietal lobe that affect attention can also affectconsciousness. This is shown in a dramatic way in people who have lesions,usually caused by a stroke in the right parietal lobe, that cause disruptions ofattention and spatial awareness. These people often behave as if the left sideof their world, including the left side of their body, does not exist. If youwere to visit such a person, and entered the room on the left, he would notrealize you were there. If you served him dinner, he would eat from only theright side of the plate! He would have shaved only the right side of his face,(or if a woman, would have put makeup on only the right side), would read to youonly the right page of a book or newspaper, and would draw only the right sideof a clock, or half of a bicycle. But what is truly odd, they don’t think thereis anything wrong! They are not conscious of their problem.This syndrome is known as hemineglect. It includes a lack of awareness forsensory events located toward the side opposite the side where the lesion is(e.g., toward the left following a right-hemisphere lesion), as well as a lossof other actions that would normally be directed toward that side.18 Somepatients may neglect half their body, attempting to climb out of bed withoutmoving their left arm or leg, even though they have no motor weakness on thatside. Neglect can also be present in memory and imagination. One patient, whenasked to describe the view from one end of a piazza from memory, described onlythe right half, but when asked to describe it from the other end looking back,described the other half with no reference to what had just been described fromthe other direction.19 This phenomenon indicates that our autobiographical selfis derived from our conscious musings. If we are not conscious of it, it doesn’texist.Many patients with hemineglect do not realize that they are missing anyinformation. This is known as anosognosia. If their lesion has also causedparalysis, they remain unaware of it. They will tell you the limp arm next tothem belongs to someone else. They can be aware that they have been diagnosedwith a deficit, but may refuse to believe it. One patient stated, “I knew theword ‘neglect’ was a sort of medical term for whatever was wrong, but the wordbothered me because you only neglect something that is actually there, don’tyou? If it’s not there, how can you neglect it? It doesn’t seem right to me thatthe word ‘neglect’ should be used to describe it. I think concentrating is abetter word than neglect. It’s definitely concentration. If I am walkinganywhere and there’s something in my way, if I’m concentrating on what I’mdoing, I will see it and avoid it. The slightest distraction and I won’t seeit.”20As this patient hints, the odd thing about hemineglect is that although it canoccur when there is actual loss of sensation or motor systems, it can also occurwhen all the sensory modalities and musculoskeletal systems are working. Neglectseems to be a loss of conscious awareness of these stimuli. Indeed, if youpresent a visual stimulus to both the right and left side at once, patients withleft hemineglect report seeing only the right stimulus, and appear unconsciousof the left stimulus. However, if you present the same left visual stimulus inisolation, so that it hits the same exact place on the retina, with no rightvisual stimulus at all, the left stimulus would be perceived normally. If thereis no competition from the normal side, then the neglected side will be noticed.We were the first to study this phenomenon in a controlled study, overtwenty-five years ago. Bruce Volpe, Joseph LeDoux, and I asked the question,“Can information in the neglected field be used at a nonconscious level?” Wepresented pictures or words, one to each visual field. The only thing thepatient suffering from hemineglect had to do was say if the two words orpictures were the same or different. Now remember, because they had neglect,when some sort of stimulus was presented to each visual field, they alwaysverbally stated they conciously saw only the one stimulus, the one that waspresented to their left (language) hemisphere. Nonetheless, when they were askedto judge if the words or pictures were the same or different, they respondedvery well. In short, somehow, somewhere in the brain, the information wascombined, and a correct decision was possible, even though the patient wasunable to say what the different stimulus was that had been presented to theright hemisphere. Needless to say, if they had guessed “same,” they would haveconcluded in a post-hoc sort of way that the stimuli had been the same.This experiment started a small cottage industry of experiments exploring whatkinds of processes could go on subconsciously. For example, word-priming studieshave also shown that even when a word is presented to the neglected field andthe patient denies its presence, the information is still being processedunconsciously and would be used for word identification.21So even if the information is there at the nonconscious level, in order for itto make it to consciousness, and for the person to become aware it is there,attention has to be directed to it. Furthermore, neglect is most apparent incompetitive situations, in which information on or closest to the “good” sidecomes to dominate information on the “bad” side.18Another odd thing is that when a patient is asked about the presence of the limparm, instead of saying that he doesn’t feel it, he goes so far as to say that itbelongs to someone else. What’s up with that? If asked to do something thatrequires the use of both hands, instead of replying that he is unable to, hewill reply simply that he doesn’t want to. And why don’t these patients complainabout the problem? If you couldn’t see the left half of the room, wouldn’t youcomplain?This is where split-brain patients are going to help out with explaining thisphenomenon and also shed some light on consciousness. The largest tract ofneurons in the brain is called the corpus callosum, (CC), and it connects thetwo hemispheres, along with a smaller tract of neurons in the front part of thebrain called the anterior commissure. The corpus callosum contains about twohundred million neurons that originate in which cortical layers? You guessed it:II and III,22 the layers where most of the long-distance neurons originate. Thecorpus callosum has not been the focus of much attention in the past, but inlight of the growing significance of the modularity and lateral specializationsof the brain, this connectivity can be seen in an evolutionary light, as wetouched on in chapter 1.> > SPLITTING THE BRAINThe surgical procedure to cut the corpus callosum is a last-ditch treatmenteffort for patients with severe intractable epilepsy for whom no othertreatments have worked. Very few patients have had this surgery, and it is doneeven more rarely now because of improved medications and other modes oftreatment. In fact, there have been only ten split-brain patients that have beenwell tested. William Van Wagenen, a Rochester, New York, neurosurgeon, performedthe procedure for the first time in 1940, following the observation that one ofhis patients with severe seizures got relief after developing a tumor in hiscorpus callosum.23Epileptic seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges that in somepeople spread from one hemisphere to the other. It was thought that if theconnection between the two sides of the brain was cut, then the electricalimpulses causing the seizures wouldn’t spread from one side of the brain to theother. The great fear was what the side effects of the surgery might be. Wouldit create a split personality, with two brains in one head? In fact, thetreatment was a great success. Most patients’ seizure activity decreased 60 to70 percent, and they felt just fine: no split personality, no splitconsciousness.24, 25 Most seemed completely unaware of any changes in theirmental processes. This was great, but puzzling nonetheless. Why don’tsplit-brain patients have dual consciousness? Why aren’t the two halves of thebrain conflicting over which half is in charge? Is one half in charge? Isconsciousness and the sense of self actually located in one half of the brain?Split-brain patients will do subtle things to compensate for their loss of brainconnectivity. They may move their heads to feed visual information to bothhemispheres, or talk out loud for the same purpose, or make symbolic handmovements. Only under experimental conditions, when we eliminate cross-cuing,does the disconnection between the two hemispheres become apparent. We are thenable to demonstrate the different abilities of the two hemispheres.Before we see what is separated after this surgery, we need to understand whatcontinues to be shared. There are subcortical pathways that remain intact. Bothhemispheres of the split-brain patient are still connected to a common brainstem, so both sides receive much of the same sensory and proprioceptiveinformation automatically coding the body’s position in space. Both hemispherescan initiate eye movements, and the brain stem supports similar arousal levels,so both sides sleep and wake up at the same time.26 There also appears to beonly one integrated spatial attention system, which continues to be unifocalafter the brain has been split. Attention cannot be distributed to two spatiallydisparate locations.27 The left brain does not pay attention to the blackboardwhile the right brain is checking out the hot dude in the next row. Emotionalstimuli presented to one hemisphere will still affect the judgment of the otherhemisphere.You may have been taught in anatomy lectures that the right hemisphere of thebrain controls the left half of the body and left hemisphere controls the righthalf of the body. Of course, things are not quite that simple. For instance bothhemispheres can guide the facial and proximal muscles, such as the upper armsand legs, but the separate hemispheres have control over the distal muscles(those farthest from the center of the body), so that, for example, the lefthemisphere controls the right hand.28 While both hemispheres can generatespontaneous facial expressions, only the dominant left hemisphere can generatevoluntary facial expressions.* [Human_split_104.html#filepos1450742]29 Becausehalf the optic nerve crosses from one side of the brain to the other at theoptic chiasm, the parts of both eyes that attend to the right visual field areprocessed in the left hemisphere, and vice versa. This information does notcross over from one disconnected hemisphere to the other. If the left visualfield sees something in isolation from the right, only the right side of thebrain has access to that visual information. This is why these patients willmove their heads to input visual information to both hemispheres.It has also been known since the first studies of Paul Broca†[Human_split_105.html#filepos1451211] that our language areas are usuallylocated in the left hemisphere (with the exception of a few left-handed people).A split-brain patient’s left hemisphere and language center have no access tothe information that is being fed to the right brain. Bearing these things inmind, we have designed ways of testing split-brain patients to better understandwhat is going on in the separate hemispheres. We have verified that the lefthemisphere is specialized for language, speech, and intelligent behavior, whilethe right is specialized for such tasks as recognizing upright faces, focusingattention, and making perceptual distinctions.Where attention is concerned, the hemispheres interact quite differently intheir control of reflexive versus voluntary attention processes.30, 31, 32 Thereis a limited amount of overall available attention.33 The evidence suggests thatreflexive (bottom-up) attention orienting happens independently in the twohemispheres, while voluntary attention orienting involves hemisphericcompetition, with control preferentially lateralized to the left hemisphere. Theright hemisphere, however, attends to the entire visual field, whereas the lefthemisphere attends only to the right field.34, 35, 36 This can explain part ofthe problem of our hemineglect patients. When the right inferior parietal lobeis damaged, the left parietal lobe remains intact. However, the left parietallobe directs its visual attention only to the right side of the body. There isno brain area paying attention to what is going on in the left visual field. Thequestion that remains is, why doesn’t this bother the patient? I’m gettingthere.> > Breaking Up Is Not So Hard to DoThe left hemisphere is specialized for intelligent behavior. Don’t leave homewithout it!After the human cerebral hemispheres have been disconnected, the verbal IQ of apatient remains intact,37, 38 and so does his problem-solving capacity. Theremay be some deficits in free-recall capacity and in other performance measures,but isolating essentially half of the cortex from the dominant left hemispherecauses no major change in cognitive functions. The left remains unchanged fromits preoperative capacity, and the largely disconnected, same-size righthemisphere is seriously impoverished in cognitive tasks. Although the righthemisphere remains superior to the isolated left hemisphere for some perceptual*[Human_split_106.html#filepos1452146] and attentional skills, and perhaps alsoemotions, it is poor at problem solving and many other mental activities. Abrain system (the right hemisphere) with roughly the same number of neurons asone that easily cogitates (the left hemisphere) is incapable of higher-ordercognition—convincing evidence that cortical cell number by itself cannot fullyexplain human intelligence.39The difference between the two hemispheres in problem solving is captured in aprobability-guessing experiment. We have subjects try to guess which of twoevents will happen next: Will it be a red light or a green light? Each event hasa different probability of occurrence (e.g., a red light appears 75 percent ofthe time and a green 25 percent of the time), but the order of occurrence of theevents is entirely random. There are two possible strategies one can use:frequency matching or maximizing. Frequency matching would involve guessing red75 percent of the time and guessing green 25 percent of the time. The problemwith that strategy is that since the order of occurrence is entirely random, itcan result in a great deal of error, often being correct only 50 percent of thetime, although it could result in being correct 100 percent of the time also,but it is fully dependent upon luck. The second strategy, maximizing, involvessimply guessing red every time. That ensures an accuracy rate of 75 percent,since red appears 75 percent of the time. Animals such as rats and goldfishmaximize. In Vegas, the house maximizes. Humans, on the other hand, match. Theresult is that nonhuman animals perform better than humans in this task.The human’s use of this suboptimal strategy has been attributed to a propensityto try to find patterns in sequences of events, even when told the sequences arerandom. George Wolford, Michael Miller, and I tested the two hemispheres ofsplit-brain patients to see if the different sides used the same or differentstrategies.40 We found that the left hemisphere used the frequency-matchingstrategy, whereas the right hemisphere maximized! Our interpretation was thatthe right hemisphere’s accuracy was higher than the left’s because the righthemisphere approaches the task in the simplest possible manner with no attemptto form complicated hypotheses about the task.However, more recent tests have yielded even more interesting findings. Theyhave shown that the right hemisphere uses frequency matching when presented withstimuli for which it is specialized, such as facial recognition, and the lefthemisphere, which is not a specialist in this task, responds randomly.41 Thissuggests that one hemisphere cedes control of a task to the other if the otherhemisphere specializes in that task.42 The left hemisphere, on the other hand,engages in the human tendency to find order in chaos. The left hemispherepersists in forming hypotheses about the sequence of events even in the face ofevidence that no pattern exists—in playing slot machines, for instance. Whywould the left hemisphere do this, even when it can be nonadaptive?> > The Left Hemisphere Is a Know-It-AllSeveral years ago, we observed something about the left hemisphere that was veryinteresting: how it deals with behaviors we had elicited from the disconnectedright hemisphere about which it had no information. We showed a split-brainpatient two pictures: a chicken claw was shown to his right visual field, so theleft hemisphere saw only that, and a snow scene was shown to the left visualfield, so the right hemisphere saw only that. He was then asked to choose froman array of pictures placed in full view in front of him. From the array ofpictures, the shovel was chosen with the left hand and the chicken with theright. When asked why he chose these items, his left-hemisphere speech centerreplied, “Oh, that’s simple. The chicken claw goes with the chicken, and youneed a shovel to clean out the chicken shed.” Here the left brain, observing theleft hand’s response without knowing why it has picked that item, had to explainit. It will not say, “I don’t know.” Instead it interprets that response in acontext consistent with what it knows, and all it knows is: chicken claw. Itknows nothing about the snow scene, but it has to explain pointing to the shovelwith the left hand. It has to find reasons for the behavior. We called thisleft-hemisphere process the interpreter.We also tried the same type of test with mood shifts. We showed a command to theright hemisphere to laugh. The patient began to laugh. Then we asked the patientwhy she was laughing. The speech center in the left hemisphere had no knowledgeof why its person was laughing, but out would come an answer anyway: “You guysare so funny!” When we triggered a negative mood in the right hemisphere by avisual stimulus, the patient denied seeing anything but suddenly said that shewas upset and that it was the experimenter that was upsetting her. She felt theemotional response to the stimulus, all the autonomic results, but had no ideawhat caused them. Ah, lack of knowledge is of no importance, the left brain willfind a solution! Order must be made. The first makes-sense explanation willdo—the experimenter did it! The left-brain interpreter makes sense out of allthe other processes. It takes all the input that is coming in and puts ittogether in a story that makes sense, even though it may be completely wrong.> > THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE INTERPRETER AND CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCESo here we are, back to the main question of the chapter: How come we feelunified when we are made up of a gazillion modules? Decades of split-brainresearch have revealed the specialized functions of the two hemispheres, as wellas providing insights into specialization within each hemisphere. Our big humanbrains have countless capacities. If we are merely a collection of specializedmodules, how does that powerful, almost self-evident feeling of unity comeabout? The answer may lie in the left-hemisphere interpreter and its drive toseek explanations for why events occur.In 1962, Stanley Schachter and Jerry Singer at Columbia University injectedepinephrine into subjects participating in a research experiment.43 Epinephrineactivates the sympathetic nervous system, and the result is an increased heartrate, hand tremors, and facial flushing. The subjects were then put into contactwith a confederate who behaved in either a euphoric or an angry manner. Thesubjects who were informed about the effects of the epinephrine attributedsymptoms such as a racing heart to the drug. The subjects who were not informed,however, attributed their autonomic arousal to the environment. Those who werewith the euphoric confederate reported being elated and those with the angryconfederate reported being angry. This finding illustrates the human tendency togenerate explanations for events. When aroused, we are driven to explain why. Ifthere is an obvious explanation, we accept it, as did the group informed aboutthe effects of epinephrine. When there is not an obvious explanation, wegenerate one. The subjects recognized that they were aroused and immediatelyassigned some cause to it. We talked about this in the last chapter when wediscussed looking over the edge of the Grand Canyon. This is a powerfulmechanism; once seen, it makes one wonder how often we are victims of spuriousemotional-cognitive correlations. (I am feeling good! I must really like thisguy! As he is thinking, Ah, the chocolate is working!) Split-brain research hasshown us that this tendency to generate explanations and hypotheses—tointerpret—lies within the left hemisphere.Although the left hemisphere seems driven to interpret events, the righthemisphere shows no such tendency. A reconsideration of hemispheric memorydifferences suggests why this dichotomy might be adaptive. When asked to decidewhether a series of items appeared in a study set or not, the right hemisphereis able to identify correctly items that have been seen previously and to rejectnew items. “Yes, there was the plastic fork, the pencil, the can opener, and theorange.” The left hemisphere, however, tends to falsely recognize new items whenthey are similar to previously presented items, presumably because they fit intothe schema it has constructed.44, 45 “Yes, the fork [but it is a silver one andnot plastic], the pencil [although this one is mechanical and the other wasnot], the can opener, and the orange.” This finding is consistent with thehypothesis that the left-hemisphere interpreter constructs theories toassimilate perceived information into a comprehensible whole. By going beyondsimply observing events to asking why they happened, a brain can cope with suchevents more effectively if they happen again. In doing so, however, the processof elaborating (story making) has a deleterious effect on the accuracy ofperceptual recognition, as it does with verbal and visual material. Accuracyremains high in the right hemisphere, however, because it does not engage inthese interpretive processes. The advantage of having such a dual system isobvious. The right hemisphere maintains an accurate record of events, leavingthe left hemisphere free to elaborate and make inferences about the materialpresented. In an intact brain, the two systems complement each other, allowingelaborative processing without sacrificing veracity.The probability-guessing paradigm also demonstrates why having an interpreter inone hemisphere and not the other would be adaptive. The two hemispheres approachproblem-solving situations in two different ways. The right hemisphere bases itsjudgments on simple frequency information, whereas the left relies on theformation of elaborate hypotheses. Sometimes it is just a random coincidence. Inthe case of random events, the right hemisphere’s strategy is clearlyadvantageous, and the left hemisphere’s tendency to create nonsensical theoriesabout random sequences is detrimental to performance. This is what happens whenyou build a theory on a single anecdotal situation. “I vomited all night. Itmust have been the food was bad at that new restaurant where I ate dinner.” Thiswould be a good hypothesis if everyone who ate what you ate became ill, but notjust one person. It may have been the flu, or your lunch. In many situations,however, there is an underlying pattern, and in these situations the lefthemisphere’s drive to create order from apparent chaos would be the beststrategy. Coincidences do happen, but sometimes there really is a conspiracy. Inan intact brain, both of these cognitive styles are available and can beimplemented, depending on the situation.The difference in the way the two hemispheres approach the world can be seen asadaptive. It might also provide some clues about the nature of humanconsciousness. In the media, split-brain patients have been described as havingtwo brains. The patients themselves, however, claim that they do not feel anydifferent after the surgery than they did before. They do not have any sense ofthe dual consciousness implied by the notion of having two brains. How is itthat two isolated hemispheres give rise to a single consciousness? Theleft-hemisphere interpreter may be the answer. The interpreter is driven togenerate explanations and hypotheses regardless of circumstances. The lefthemisphere of split-brain patients does not hesitate to offer explanations forbehaviors that are generated by the right hemisphere. In neurologically intactindividuals, the interpreter does not hesitate to generate spurious explanationsfor sympathetic nervous system arousal. In these ways, the left-hemisphereinterpreter may generate a feeling in all of us that we are integrated andunified.In his masterpiece, The Alexandria Quartet, Lawrence Durrell tells a story infour books, Justine, Balthazar, Mountolive, and Clea. Each of the first threebooks tells the story of a group of people living in Alexandria, Egypt, justbefore World War II, from the viewpoint of a different character. If you were toread only the first book, Justine, you would have a distorted idea of all thatwas going on. The second book, Balthazar, gives you more information, and thethird even more. In all three, however, the reader is at the mercy of thenarrators. Your interpretation of the story is dependent upon what they tellyou: Your interpretation is dependent upon the supplied information. This istrue for the interpretive system in the brain, also. The conclusions of aninterpretive system are only as good as the information it receives.Now, finally, we can consider our patients with hemineglect. First, let’s startwith an easy case. If a person has a lesion in the optic nerve that carriesinformation about vision to the visual cortex, the damaged nerve ceases to carrythat information; the patient complains that he is blind in the relevant part ofhis visual field. For example, such a patient might have a huge blind spot tothe left of center in his visual field. No wonder he complains. However, ifanother patient has a lesion not in the optic tract but in the visual cortex(the area where the visual information is processed after it is received), andit creates a blind spot of the same size in the same place, he usually does notcomplain at all. The reason is, the cortical lesion is in the place in his brainthat represents an exact part of the visual world, the place that ordinarilyasks, “What is going on to the left of visual center?” With a lesion on theoptic nerve, this brain area was functioning; when it could not get anyinformation from the nerve, it squawked—“something is wrong, I am not gettingany input!” When that same brain area is itself damaged and no longer does itsjob, the patient’s brain no longer has an area responsible for what is going onin that part of the visual field; for that patient, that part of the visualfield no longer exists, so there is no squawk at all. The patient with thecentral lesion does not have a complaint because the part of the brain thatmight complain has been incapacitated, and no other takes over.As we move further down the line into the brain’s processing centers, we see thesame pattern, but now the problem is with the interpretive function. Theparietal cortex is constantly seeking information on the arm’s position inthree-dimensional space, and it also monitors the arm’s existence in relation toeverything else. If there is a lesion in the sensory nerves that bringinformation to the brain about where the arm is, what is in its hand, or whetherit is in pain or feels hot or cold, the brain communicates that something iswrong: “I am not getting any input! Where’s the left hand? I can’t feel athing!” But if the lesion is in the parietal cortex, that monitoring function isgone with no squawk raised, because the squawker is damaged. Consider our caseof anosognosia and the disowned left hand. A patient with a right parietallesion suffers damage to the area that represents the body’s left half. It is asif that part of the body has lost its representative in the brain and left notrace. There is no brain area that knows about the left half of the body andwhether it is working or not. When a neurologist holds a patient’s left hand upto the patient’s face, the patient gives a reasonable response: “That’s not myhand.” The interpreter, which is intact and working, cannot get news from theparietal lobe; in fact, it does not even know that there should be news from theparietal lobe, since the flow of information has been disrupted by the lesion.For the interpreter, which is dependent upon the information it receives, theleft hand simply does not exist anymore, just as seeing behind the head orwagging a tail is not something the interpreter is supposed to worry about. Itis true, then, that the hand held in front of him cannot be his. In this light,the claims of the patient are more reasonable.Reduplicative paramnesia is another odd syndrome, in which there is thedelusional belief that a place has been duplicated, or exists in more than onespot at the same time, or has been moved to a different location. One suchpatient I had was a woman who, although she was being examined in my office atNew York Hospital, claimed we were in her home in Freeport, Maine. The standardinterpretation of this syndrome is that she made a duplicate copy of a place (orperson) and insisted there were two.This woman was intelligent; before the interview she was biding her time readingthe New York Times. I started with the “So, where are you?” question. “I am inFreeport, Maine. I know you don’t believe it. Dr. Posner told me this morningwhen he came to see me that I was in Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital and thatwhen the residents come on rounds to say that to them. Well, that is fine, but Iknow I am in my house on Main Street in Freeport, Maine!”I asked, “Well, if you are in Freeport and in your house, how come there areelevators outside the door here?” The grand lady peered at me and calmlyresponded, “Doctor, do you know how much it cost me to have those put in?”This patient’s interpreter tried to make sense of what she knew and felt anddid. Because of her lesion, the part of the brain that represents locality wasoveractive and sending out an erroneous message about her location. Theinterpreter is only as good as the information it receives, and in this instanceit was getting a wacky piece of information. Yet the interpreter still has tofield questions and make sense of other incoming information—information that tothe interpreter is self-evident. The result? A lot of imaginative stories.In Capgras’ syndrome, patients will recognize a familiar person but will insistthat the person is an imposter and has been replaced by an identical double. Forinstance, a woman will say Jack (who really is her husband) looks like herhusband, but he really isn’t her husband, he’s a double, or an alien. In thissyndrome, it appears that the emotional feelings for the familiar person aredisconnected from the representation of that person.46 The patient feels noemotion when they see the familiar person. The interpreter has to explain thisphenomenon. It is receiving the information from the face identification module:“That’s Jack.” However, it is not receiving any emotional information. Thereforein order to explain the situation, the interpreter comes up with a solution: “Itmust not really be Jack, because if it really were Jack I’d feel some emotion,so he is an imposter!”> > I JUST GOTTA BE ME! SELF-AWARENESSThe interpreter also has other duties. This system that started out making senseof all the information bombarding the brain—interpreting our cognitive andemotional responses to what we encounter in our environment, asking how onething relates to another, making hypotheses, bringing order out of chaos—alsocreates a running narrative of our actions, emotions, thoughts, and dreams. Theinterpreter is the glue that keeps our story unified and creates our sense ofbeing a coherent, rational agent. Insertion of an interpreter into an otherwisefunctioning brain creates many by-products. A device that begins by asking howone thing relates to another, a device that asks about an infinite number ofthings, in fact, and that can get productive answers to its questions, cannothelp but give birth to the concept of self. Surely one big question the devicewould ask is, “Who is solving all these problems? Hmm…Let’s call it me”—and awayit goes!* [Human_split_107.html#filepos1452593]“My sense of self is a by-product?”Yes, sorry. Now at this point we could get all philosophical or Freudian aboutwhat is self or I, but we aren’t going there. We are going to cognitivepsychology instead.It is generally agreed that self-cognition is constructed from several distinctprocesses, and several different proposals have been made as to what processesmake up self-cognition. John Kihlstrom and my colleague Stan Klein47 at theUniversity of California, Santa Barbara, emphasize that the self is a knowledgestructure, not a mystical entity. They have suggested that there are fourcategories of self-knowledge that are stored and cataloged in different formatsin the brain. 1. The conceptual self: a fuzzy set of context-specific selves united by a theory of how we got to be the person that we are. “I am a generous (or stingy), happy (or taciturn), and swell (or jerky) guy because my parents (or church or society or Bacchus) taught me (or made me) to be that way.” According to Pascal Boyer and colleagues48 this would include the domain of social systems: The self-concept includes notions of social identity or moral status and also includes the capacities for theory of mind and empathy. 2. The self as a narrative, which we have constructed, rehearsed to ourselves, and told to others about the past, present, and future. “I was born on a ranch, grew up breaking horses, and knew rodeo was my life.” 3. The self viewed as an image, with details about face, body, and gestures. “I am slender, graceful, and quite striking. You gotta see me tango!” 4. An associative network with information about personality traits, memories, and experiences, stored separately in episodic and semantic memory. “I am confident and outgoing and always have a great tan. I was born in Tahiti, moved to Hawaii, had a great time there, and won the state surfing championships on a totally gnarly surf day. Chicks dig me.”This is sounding suspiciously familiar. I submit that it is the left-braininterpreter that is coming up with the theory, the narrative, and theself-image, taking the information from various inputs, from the “neuronalworkspace,” and from the knowledge structures, and gluing it together, thuscreating the self, the autobiography, out of the chaos of input.Do these knowledge structures about self differ from other knowledge structures?Some neuropsychologists think not much. James Gilligan and Martha Farah at theUniversity of Pennsylvania think that most structures are probably not distinctfrom processes involving persons in general.49 This actually makes a lot ofsense in terms of brain economy. I propose that the left-brain interpreter isuniquely human. It can take information from a wide variety of sources, the samesources that are available to other animals, but it integrates that informationin a unique way to create our self-conscious self. There has been a phase shift.The degree to which humans are self-aware is unique.However, there may be some specialized knowledge structures that we willconsider that give our interpreter an edge. First we are going to learn a bitabout memory, and then we are going back to patients with lesions that affectthe sense of self, to see if we can learn anything more. Remember that theinterpreter can use only information that it has available.Consider the trip to the Côte d’Azur. In proposing such a trip, you are usinginformation that you know about yourself that indicates that you will enjoy thetrip. Where is this information coming from? How about your travel partner? Isthe same information available about another person, and is it stored as memoryin the same place? One fascinating aspect of memory that was noticed severalyears ago was that if you asked a person if a certain word was self-descriptive,that word would later be remembered better than if you asked about the word in amore general sense. For instance a person would remember the word kind better ifhe had been asked, “Are you kind?” than if he had been asked, “What does kindmean?”50 This led researchers to believe that self-knowledge might be stored ina different manner than other information.Memory stores two basic types of information: procedural and declarative.51Procedural memory allows one to retain perceptual, motor, and cognitive skillsand express them nonconsciously, such as driving a car, riding a bicycle, tyinga shoelace, braiding one’s hair, and, eventually, playing the piano. Declarativememory is made up of facts and beliefs about the world, such as, the desert ishot in the summer, and orange blossoms are fragrant. Neuroscientist EndelTulving, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto, proposes that thereare two types of declarative memory: semantic and episodic.51, 52, 53Semantic memory is generic: “Just the facts ma’am, just the facts,” notnecessarily associated with the source or where or when they were learned. Cairois the capital of Egypt, 12 squared is 144, and most wine is made from grapes.Semantic memory makes no subjective reference to the self, although it can havefacts about the self: “I have green eyes. I was born in Timbuctoo.” Semanticmemory provides knowledge from the point of view of an observer of the worldrather than that of a participant. Episodic memory retains events that wereexperienced by the self at a particular place and time. “I had a great time atthe party last night, and the food was delicious!”Tulving is continually sculpting the definition of episodic memory as more isknown about it. Because he considers episodic memory uniquely human, and sinceit will be important in our discussion of animal consciousness later, I willquote his most recent sculpting.> Episodic memory is a recently evolved, late developing, and early> deteriorating brain/mind (neurocognitive) memory system. It is oriented to the> past, more vulnerable than other memory systems to neuronal dysfunction, and> probably unique to humans. It makes possible mental time travel through> subjective time—past, present, and future. This mental time travel allows one,> as an “owner” of episodic memory (“self”), through the medium of autonoetic> awareness,* [Human_split_108.html#filepos1452884] to remember one’s own> previous “thought-about” experiences, as well as to “think about” one’s own> possible future experiences. The operations of episodic memory require, but go> beyond the semantic memory system. Retrieving information from episodic memory> (“remembering”) requires the establishment and maintenance of a special mental> set, dubbed episodic “retrieval mode.” The neural components of episodic> memory comprise a widely distributed network of cortical and subcortical brain> regions that overlap with and extend beyond the networks subserving other> memory systems. The essence of episodic memory lies in the conjunction of> three concepts—self, autonoetic awareness, and subjective time.54By definition, episodic memory always includes the self as the agent orrecipient of some action. When a person—let’s call her Sarah—remembers an event,she reexperiences it with the awareness that it happened to her: “I rememberseeing the Stones last year. They were great!” The major distinction betweenepisodic and semantic memory is not the type of information they encode, but thesubjective experience that accompanies the operations of the systems at encodingand retrieval. Sarah could say, “I saw the Stones last year,” as a fact, even ifshe was too drunk to actually remember having done so. Episodic memory is rootedin autonoetic awareness and in the belief that the self having the experiencenow is the same self that had it originally. Semantic memory requires onlynoetic awareness, which is experienced when one thinks objectively aboutsomething that one knows. Tulving emphasizes that it is “possible to benoetically aware of one’s self, including body position in space, traits, andcharacteristics, and even autobiographical facts that are not accompanied by afeeling of re-experiencing or reliving the past.”It is looking as though semantic memory appears earlier in development thanepisodic memory. Although very young children appear to be able to rememberfacts and can think about things that are not physically present (that is, theyhave semantic memory), it is difficult to determine whether they can consciouslyrecollect the past in a way that engages a developed episodic system. Babies whoare two years old have been able to demonstrate recall of things that they hadwitnessed at age thirteen months.55 However, several pieces of evidence supportthe idea that it isn’t until children are at least eighteen months old that theyactually include themselves as part of the memory, although this ability tendsto be more reliably present in three- to four-year-olds.56, 57 In fact, itappears that children less than four years old have no knowledge of timescales,58, 59 which is why it is never a good idea to tell them that you will begoing to Disneyland in two weeks. This later-developing episodic memory explainswhy there is scant autobiographical memory from our very early years.Evolutionary psychology theory, however, is not going to be happy with onlyepisodic memory doing all the autobiographical work. It would take way too longwhen you need “quick and dirty” answers. If our ancestor was presented with thequestion of whether to chase a prey or not, he needed a fast answer about hiscapabilities. He couldn’t wait around while he remembered every gazelle andwarthog that he had ever run after and whether his speed and endurance matchedtheirs, and calculate the probabilities; he needed precomputed and storedanswers: “I am fast, strong, and have endurance. Go for it!” or “I am slow,wimpy, and tire easily, and besides that, warthogs are gross. I’ll just tellCronos where it is.”Well, guess what? The semantic system, that “Just the facts, ma’am” system,appears to have a subsystem for personality trait summaries. Stan Klein andJudith Loftus did some tests to tease out whether personality trait summarieswere stored separately from episodic memory. Subjects were given pairs of tasks,the first serving as a prime for the second. The first task varied amonganswering if a trait was self-descriptive (“Are you generous?”), doing a fillertask (“Define the word table”), or a control task (which was either looking at ablank screen or defining a trait word: “What does selfish mean?”). Next, if thefirst task had been answering whether a trait was self-descriptive, the secondtask was to remember an episode in which the subject had displayed that trait.The experimenters measured the amount of time it took to come up with theremembered episode. If the subjects had seen only a blank screen, they werepresented with a new trait and asked to come up with an episode in which theyhad displayed that trait. The researchers reasoned that if subjects had usedepisodic memory to come up with an answer about whether a trait wasself-descriptive (yes, I’m generous), then they should be faster at describingan episode when they displayed that trait, because they would already havethought of it to answer the first question. However, this isn’t what happened.It took subjects just as long to remember an episode of a trait that they hadalready been asked about as they did to remember an episode of a different traitof which no previous mention had been made. The experimenters concluded thatpeople can answer questions about their personality traits by accessing traitsummaries without invoking memories of specific episodes.60Other research Klein and Loftus have done has shown that episodic memory iscalled in only when there is no trait summary available—for instance, whenexperience is extremely limited in regard to a specific trait. This also holdstrue when making judgments of other people. Episodic memory is called upon onlywhen no trait summary exists.61 One patient with total amnesia who could notremember a single thing he had done or experienced in his life has beenextensively studied. Not only does he have no episodic memory, but his semanticmemory has also been partially lost. Although he could not accurately describethe personality of his daughter, he could accurately describe his ownpersonality. He knew some facts about his life, but was missing others. He knewsome well-known facts about history, but not others. This patient’s pattern ofdeficits strongly suggests that there is specific memory architecture forstorage and retrieval of self personality traits.The general trend from studies that have been done on self-referential traitspoints to left-hemisphere involvement.62 How about the autobiographical episodicmemories? Can they be located? The answer to this question has been elusive;some evidence points to one side, some to the other. The picture that isemerging is that aspects of self-knowledge are distributed throughout thecortex, a little here, a little there. There is some evidence that the frontalregions of the left hemisphere play a pivotal role in setting the goal forretrieval and reconstruction of autobiographical knowledge.63, 64, 65Do split-brain patients help us out at all with locating where self processingis located? Severing the corpus callosum in humans has raised a fundamentalquestion about the nature of the self: Does each disconnected half brain haveits own sense of self? Could it be that each hemisphere has its own point ofview, its own self-referential system that is truly separate and different fromthat of the other hemisphere?66Early observations of split-brain patients indicated that this could be thecase.67 There were moments when one hemisphere seemed to be belligerent whilethe other was calm. There were times when the left hand (controlled by the righthemisphere) behaved playfully with an object that was held out of view while theleft hemisphere seemed perplexed about why. However, of the dozens of instancesrecorded over the years, none allowed for a clear-cut claim that each hemispherehas a full sense of self. Although it has been difficult to study the self perse, there have been intriguing observations about perceptual and cognitiveprocessing relating to the self.Research has revealed much about the processes and brain structures that supportthe recognition of familiar others (for example, friends, family members, andmovie stars). Both functional imaging and patient studies show that facerecognition is typically reliant on structures in the right cerebral hemisphere.For example, we have shown that split-brain patients perform significantlybetter on tests of face recognition when familiar faces are presented to theright hemisphere rather than the left hemisphere.68 Similarly, damage tospecific cortical areas in the right hemisphere impairs the ability to recognizeothers.69, 70, 71, 72, 73But is the right hemisphere similarly specialized for self-recognition? Althoughsome support has been garnered for this idea,74, 75, 76 the available evidenceis inconclusive. Neuroimaging studies have revealed that highly self-relevantmaterial (for example, autobiographical memories) activates a range of corticalnetworks in the left hemisphere that could, potentially, supportself-recognition and a host of related cognitive functions.77, 78, 79 Therefore,whereas the recognition of familiar others relies primarily on structures in theright hemisphere, self-recognition might be supported by additionalleft-lateralized cognitive processes. To investigate this possibility, DavidTurk and colleagues assessed face recognition of self versus a familiar other ina split-brain patient.80Patient J.W. viewed a series of facial photographs that ranged from 0 percent to100 percent self-images. A photograph of me (M.G.), a longtime associate of J.W.(that is, a highly familiar other), was used to represent 0 percent self, and aphotograph of J.W. was used to represent 100 percent self. Nine additionalimages were generated using computer-morphing software, each image representinga 10 percent incremental shift from M.G. to J.W. In one condition(self-recognition), J.W. was asked to indicate whether the presented image washe; in the other condition (familiar-other recognition), he was asked toindicate whether the image was M.G. The only difference across the twoconditions was the judgment that was required (Is it me? versus Is it Mike?).The results revealed a double dissociation in J.W.’s face-recognitionperformance. His left hemisphere showed a bias toward recognizing morphed facesas self, whereas his right hemisphere showed the opposite pattern; that is,biased recognition in favor of a familiar other. In short, the left hemisphereis quick to detect a partial self-image, even one that is only slightlyreminiscent of the self, whereas the right brain needs an essentially full andcomplete picture of the self before it recognizes the image as such. In the lefthemisphere, there was, essentially, a linear relationship between the amount ofself in the image and the probability of detecting self. The right hemisphere,on the other hand, did not recognize the image as self until the image containedmore than 80 percent self. The finding that the left hemisphere requires lessself in the image for self-recognition might reflect a key role of the lefthemisphere in the retrieval of self-knowledge, or might depend on the left-braininterpreter taking whatever information is available and making a judgment callon the basis of that information. This also goes along with the right brain’sbeing more accurate and maximizing information, not forming a hypothesis—“Wait aminute, that is not me. That nose is not quite right,” while the left brain willfrequency-match and hypothesize, “Yep that’s me!”Overall, the data indicate that a sense of self arises out of distributednetworks in both hemispheres.80, 81 It is likely that both hemispheres haveprocessing specializations that contribute to a sense of self, and that sense ofself is constructed by the left-hemisphere interpreter on the basis of the inputfrom these distributed networks.> > ANIMALS AND CONSCIOUSNESS: TO WHAT DEGREE?This is the question that intrigues many animal researchers. The answer has beenelusive. If only they could talk, they would be so much easier to study. Toparaphrase Steve Martin,* [Human_split_109.html#filepos1453133] “Boy, thoseanimals! They don’t have a different word for anything!” As I mentioned earlier,there are many levels of consciousness, defined differently by differentresearchers. It is well accepted that mammals are conscious to the here and now,but the debate begins with the degree of extended consciousness that theypossess. The problem is, how can one design an experiment that could demonstratedegrees of consciousness in a nonverbal animal? Come up with the answer to thatproblem and you have yourself a big fat PhD dissertation.In order to determine degrees of extended consciousness an animal possesses, oneneeds to know what is considered to be extended consciousness. The basic stepthat is made into extended consciousness is becoming self-aware to some degree.Self-awareness means being the object of one’s own attention. Various scientistsdescribe this as ranging from merely being aware of the products ofself-perception or environmental stimuli (“I hear a noise,” “I feel a thorn”) tothe ability of conceptualizing information about the self, which needs to bedetermined abstractly (“I am hip.”)82 This has led animal researchers toconcentrate in two areas: animal self-awareness and animal metacognition(thinking about thinking).> > Animal Self-AwarenessIn discussing animal self-awareness, Marc Hauser makes the point that when itwould pay, in evolutionary terms, to treat some members of your own speciesdifferently from others is when the discrimination leads to fitness payoffs.Thus it may pay to be able to recognize the opposite sex, or the age of anotherindividual (if they were sexually mature…no use wasting time on courting animmature individual), or your own mother, or kin versus non-kin, or othermembers of your own pack or hive. He tells us, “All social, sexually reproducingorganisms seem to be equipped with neural machinery for discriminating malesfrom females, juveniles from adults, and relatives from nonrelatives.”83Many different systems have evolved to help identify kin from non-kin. Onesystem that many birds have is imprinting. The first individual they see is Ma.This usually works, but glitches in this system have been the basis of manycartoons. Sweat bees and paper wasps recognize their colony by odor, groundsquirrels also use odor for recognition,84 and Mexican free-tail bats recognizetheir own pup out of thousands through vocal and olfactory communication. Theserecognition systems use some sensory perception to clue recognition, a match toa specified neural template, but they do not require any self-awareness, any“knowing of self” to work.Trying to design a test to demonstrate self-awareness in animals has provendifficult. In the past it has been approached from two angles. One is mirrorself-recognition and the other is through imitation. Gordon Gallup approachedthe problem by developing a mirror test, in which he anesthetized chimpanzees,put a red mark on one ear and eyebrow, and then, after they had recovered fromthe anesthesia, presented them with a full-length mirror. Prior to exposure tothe mirror, the chimps didn’t touch the red marks, but once the mirror waspresented, they did. After being left with the mirror, a while later they beganto look at visibly inaccessible parts of their bodies.85 Not all chimps exhibitmirror self-recognition (MSR), however.86 Later experiments have shown that MSRdevelops in some, but not all, chimps around puberty, but is present to a lesserdegree in older chimps,87 and in fact may deteriorate over time.88 Orangutansalso show MSR, but only a rare gorilla possesses it.89, 90 Two dolphins91 (witha few questions still to be addressed concerning differences in testingprocedures92) and one out of the five Asian elephants that have been tested intwo different studies have also passed the mark test.93, 94 That’s it, folks.No other animal species has yet been found that exhibits MSR. This is why yourdog isn’t all that interested when you try to get him to look in the mirror.Children have MSR and pass the mark test by age two.95 Gallup has suggested thatmirror self-recognition implies the presence of a self-concept andself-awareness.96 This sounds like a reasonable test until Robert Mitchell, apsychologist at Eastern Kentucky University, chimes in by asking, What degree ofself-awareness is demonstrated by recognizing oneself in the mirror? Mitchellpoints out that MSR requires only an awareness of the body, rather than anyabstract concept of self.97 There is no need to invoke anything more thanmatching sensation to visual perception; attitudes, values, intentions, emotion,and episodic memory are not required to recognize one’s body in the mirror. Achimp looks down and sees his arm and wills it to move. It moves. He sees itmove in the mirror. No grand concept of self is needed. Mitchell divides theself into three levels: 1. The implicit self, a point of view that experiences, acts, and in the case of mammals and birds, has emotions and feelings. A hamster is hungry, and can experience eating and can like eating, but it probably doesn’t know that it likes to eat. 2. The self built upon kinesthetic visual matching, which leads to MSR, the first step to imitation, pretense, planning, self-conscious emotion, and imaginative experience. 3. The self built on symbols, language, and artifacts, which provides support for shared cultural beliefs, social norms, inner speech, dissociation, and evaluation by others, as well as self-evaluation.98Another problem with the MSR test is that some patients with prosopagnosia(inability to recognize faces) cannot recognize themselves in a mirror. Theythink they are seeing someone else. However, they do have a sense of self, whichis why the problem is so distressing to them. The absence of MSR, then, doesn’tnecessarily mean the absence of self-awareness. So although the MSR test canindicate a degree of self-awareness, it is of limited value in evaluating justhow self-aware an animal is. It does not answer the question of whether ananimal is aware only of its visible self or if it is aware of unobservablefeatures. Povinelli and Cant have suggested that a sense of physicalself-awareness in nonhuman primates may have evolved in large arboreal primatesto meet the challenges of crossing between gaps in trees, where their weight wasan issue in selecting their route.99 Knowing that they had a body and that onlycertain structures could support it provided a survival advantage.If one can imitate another’s actions, then one is capable of distinguishingbetween one’s own actions and the other’s. The ability to imitate is used asevidence for self-recognition in developmental studies of children. We have seenin chapter 5 that there is sparse evidence for imitation in the animal world.Josep Call has summarized the research, concluding that most of the evidence inprimates points to the ability to reproduce the result of an action, not imitatethe action itself.100Tulving’s suggestion that episodic memory—which includes an awareness of self inits definition and the ability to project oneself into the past or future—isuniquely human has also been a field of focus to identify self-awareness. If ananimal can demonstrate its capacity for episodic memory, then it must have aconcept of self. Tulving outlines the challenges and pitfalls of identifyingepisodic memory in animals. Much research on animal memory has been concernedwith perceptual memory, which doesn’t require declarative memory. Even when sometests require more than perceptual memory, they can be successfully performedusing declarative semantic memory without episodic memory.Many previous studies have assumed that animals have episodic memory when theydemonstrated some behaviors. These studies, however, did not separate memory forfacts, which would be semantic memory, from memory for events. Episodic memorytests require the subject to answer what, where, when (the when has been lackingin most tests), and then one final question that is the most difficult to study.Is the animal remembering the experience with an attached emotional component,or does it merely know that it happened? (This is the difference between knowingwhen you born versus remembering the experience of your birth, or knowing thatone eats every day versus remembering the experience of a particular meal.) Theproblem has been figuring out how to approach that experiential aspect. Inhumans, we can just ask, although even this does not always give accurateinformation, because we have the know-it-all interpreter providing the answers.Animal studies have had to focus on behavior criteria. It has taken years tounderstand that much of what we do is not under conscious control, even thoughwe thought that it was, so attributing conscious action to animals is also goingto be tempting but needs to be rigorously evaluated.Povinelli and his colleagues did an interesting study with children thatrevealed a developmental difference in semantic and episodic memory.101 First heunobtrusively put stickers on the foreheads of two-, three-, and four-year-oldswhile they were playing a game. Three minutes later, he showed them either avideo of this action or a Polaroid picture of it to find out whether what achild learned about a past experience could be assimilated into the present.About 75 percent of the four-year-olds had immediately reached up and pulled thesticker off, while none of the two-year-olds and only 25 percent of thethree-year-olds had done so. However, when he handed the two- andthree-year-olds a mirror and they glimpsed themselves, they all immediatelypulled off the stickers. The researchers suggested that the difference inreaction to live versus delayed feedback in the different age groups indicated adevelopmental lag between the development of a self-concept and a self-conceptthat includes temporal continuity. Specifically, children may not assume thattheir currently experienced state is determined by previous states. The two- tothree-year-olds were not yet able to project themselves into the past, not yetable to time-travel. This is further indication that possessing MSR is notevidence for the possession of episodic memory and full self-awareness, and thatsemantic and episodic memory develop separately.Thomas Suddendorf, a psychologist at the University of Queensland, Australia,and Michael Corballis, from the University of Auckland, New Zealand, make theinteresting point that in order to have episodic memory and to time-travel, manycognitive abilities are involved. It is not just a single module doing itsthing. Thus in order to establish if episodic memory is present in otherspecies, they need to possess all the cognitive abilities required. What arethese? Beyond some level of self-awareness, they must have an imagination ableto reconstruct the order of events, must be able to metarepresent theirknowledge (to be able to think about thinking), and must be able to dissociatefrom their current mental state (I am not hungry now, but I may be in thefuture). Episodic memory also requires that an animal understand theperception-knowledge contingency, that is, that seeing is knowing: I know thatbecause Susan has her eyes covered, she cannot see me; or I know that becauseAnn is not in the room, she did not see Sally move the ball to a new place. Italso requires the ability to attribute past mental states to one’s earlier self:I used to think the candy was in the blue box, but now I know that it is in thered one. These systems aren’t up and running in children until age four.Included in these cognitive abilities is a concept derived from theBischof-Kohler hypothesis, which states, “Animals other than humans cannotanticipate future needs or drive states and are therefore bound to a presentthat is defined by their current motivational state.”102 That means that if ananimal is not hungry now, it is unable to plan for actions in the near futurethat involve eating; it cannot uncouple or dissociate from its currentmotivation (to lie down, perhaps) to plan for something that would be the resultof a different motivational state.The idea that “animals may be stuck in time,” as suggested by a comprehensivereview of animal memory studies done by William Roberts,103 a psychologist atthe University of Western Ontario, seems a little farfetched when you thinkabout how your dog “knows” it is 7:00 P.M. and time for his walk, or waits atthe door for you to get home from work every day at 5:30. Or how about all thosedang birds that have the intelligence to head south for the winter while you arecrazy enough to stay in Buffalo, or bears eating their fill all summer andholing up for the winter? They seem to understand time and are planning ahead.These abilities turn out to be regulated by internal cues that have to do withcircadian rhythms rather than a concept of time. A bear that hibernates for thefirst time cannot be planning ahead for the long cold winter: It doesn’t evenknow that there are long cold winters.> > The Search for Episodic Memory in AnimalsSome of the most tantalizing sets of animal studies looking for episodic memoryhave been done by Nicola Clayton and Anthony Dickinson, professors at theUniversity of Cambridge, studying scrub jays.104, 105, 106, 107, 108 What wasdifferent about their studies was that they designed them to determine if thejays were answering the what, where, and when questions about multiple episodesthat were unique in time and flexibly recalled. The jays more recently are evenanswering the who question. Thus they are using multiple components of an event,not just a single bit of information.You may have been inadvertently using a misguided epithet when you referred tothe annoying person on the phone or in traffic as a birdbrain. While most of ushave been going about our daily lives, working, enjoying our vacations, andworrying about our taxes, there has been a revolution going on in the study ofbird brains. I am not kidding! There has been a major change in theunderstanding of bird-brain anatomy and their neural connections, which has ledto new ideas about the structure and function of parts of the avian brain.109While birds lack the neocortical structure of mammals, they have many brainstructures that serve the same purpose as mammalian brain structures, and havesimilar thalamic-cortical loop connections.110 This has led to the realizationthat some species of birds have a lot more going on upstairs than had previouslybeen thought. The presence of loop connections similar to the loop connectionsproposed to allow extended consciousness in humans leads to the hypothesis thatthey are performing the same operation in birds and providing them with somelevel of extended consciousness. This actually should come as no surprise toanyone who has spent much time watching ravens, crows, jays, or some species ofparrots.So, back to the scrub jays: Clayton, a former colleague of mine when we wereboth at the University of California, Davis, found that Florida scrub jays(Aphelocoma coerulescens) will cache different types of food in differentplaces, at different times, and will selectively retrieve food that degrades,and eat that before retrieving and eating food that stores well. Her birdsfulfill the when, what, and where questions, and are flexible. What is still notanswered is if it is semantic knowledge or experiential. All the jay really isdemonstrating is that it can update its knowledge, as psychologist BennettSchwartz maintains; it is like the memory of where one’s keys are. Clayton callsit episode-like memory because of this problem.111Another tantalizing finding is that jays adjust their caching strategies tominimize potential stealing by other birds. If an individual jay (let’s call himBuzz) had stolen food from another’s cache in the past, and if while Buzz wascaching his food he was observed by another jay, then after that other bird wasremoved, Buzz would recache his food in private. Not only that, Buzz also keepstrack of who is observing him cache. If it is a dominant bird, he is more likelyto rehide his food in private than if it is his mate or a subordinate bird. Heis also less likely to recache his food if a new jay appears who had not watchedhim hide food previously.112 However, if Buzz had never stolen food from anotherjay in the past, then he would not recache his food even though his caching hadbeen observed. These results indicate that recaching depended on previousexperience as a thief.113 Walking on the wild side, Clayton and her coworkerssuggest that maybe these scrub jays are showing evidence of knowing what anotherjay knows: theory of mind.You may recall from chapter 2 the studies that revealed planning behavior inorangutans and bonobos, done by Mulcahy and Call.114 These are the best evidenceso far that imaginary time travel is not unique to humans. These were thestudies that demonstrated future planning of tool use when the subject carried atool from one room to another for use up to fourteen hours later. These authorsconcluded:> Because traditional learning mechanisms or certain biological predispositions> appear insufficient to explain our current results, we propose that they> represent a genuine case of future planning.

Hethinks, “Although the data suggest anticipation of the future need for a tool,they do not necessarily imply anticipation of a future state of mind.”115 Itseems that the quest for nonhuman episodic memory is still afoot, and designingtests that can demonstrate it is the current stumbling block, although they areslowly being improved upon.> > Do Animals Think About What They Know?While most research on animals has been concentrating on the theory-of-mindquestion and what an animal knows about another’s knowledge, little has beendone on what an animal knows about its own knowledge. A newer approach inlooking for self-reflective consciousness has been to look for metacognition, orthinking about thinking, which is awareness of one’s own mental operations. Doanimals think about what they know? This is another difficult question to study.One approach has been through the testing of uncertainty. Humans know when theydon’t know something, or when they are unsure of something. J. David Smith, apsychologist at the State University of New York at Buffalo, thought thatdesigning a test that included uncertainty might demonstrate metacognition inanimals. He designed a visual density test in which rhesus monkeys and humansused a joystick to move a cursor to one of three objects on a computerscreen.116 They were to judge if a box was densely lit (exactly 2,950 pixels) orsparsely lit if it had fewer. They could pick the “dense” response, the “sparse”response, or the “uncertain” response, which was represented by a star on thescreen. If they picked the star, they went automatically to a new guaranteed-wintrial. The difficulty of making the discrimination gradually increased, untilmost faltered at about the 2,600-pixel level. Interestingly, the monkeys’ andthe humans’ responses were much the same. After the test, the humans verballyreported that when they had guessed that the screen was either sparse or dense,their answers were dependent on the visual stimulus; however when they chose theuncertain response, it was because they had personal feelings of uncertainty anddoubt: “I was uncertain,” “I didn’t know,” or “I couldn’t tell.” Smith concludedthat the “uncertain” response in humans might reveal not only metacognitivemonitoring but also a reflexive awareness of the self as cognitive monitor.A similar study has been done with a male bottlenose dolphin using an auditorydiscrimination test. The dolphin had to press a high paddle for the high-pitchedtone (2100 Hz), a low paddle for any other tone, and a third paddle if he wasuncertain. This paddle was picked when the tone approached 2085 Hz or greater.The dolphin, when responding with certainty, also swam quickly to the paddle;however, when he was not, he swam more slowly and wavered between thepaddles.117 The demonstration that animals had an uncertainty response and usedit in situations similar to those when humans demonstrated uncertainty wasinterpreted to mean that monkeys and dolphins have metacognition.Reactions to this suggestion have been varied, with some agreement and someskepticism.118 The problem is in the original assumption that the humans werethinking about thinking when they made their uncertain response. I don’t thinkmetacognition came into the picture until they were asked about their response.That is when the left-hemisphere interpreter revved up to explain theirresponse. The choice was powered by emotional responses to the stimuli, the oldapproach–don’t approach response. The problem comes from the assumption thathumans were using higher cognition when they may not have been. PhilosopherDerek Browne, from the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand, hasa similar take in discussing the results of the dolphin study. He suggests thatit isn’t until the postexperimental probe (or question) is applied that humansubjects apply psychological concepts to their own earlier performances.119The latest tests have been done with rats by Allison Foote and Jonathon Crystalat the University of Georgia. First their rats heard either a short sound or along one. Next, for a reward, the rats had to pick whether the recent noise hadbeen short or long. This was easy unless they were given sounds that wereintermediate in length. If the rat was correct, it got a big food reward, and ifit was wrong, zilch. However, before it was given the choice, the rat could optout of the test and get a small food reward. Sometimes, however, it was notallowed to opt out but was forced to make a choice. Two interesting thingshappened. The more difficult it was to distinguish the sounds, the morefrequently the rats opted out of the test if they could. And second, as youwould expect, test accuracy declined as the difficulty of thetime-discrimination task increased, but this decline in accuracy was greaterwhen rats were forced to do the test. The findings suggest that rats couldassess whether they were going to pass a test on a trial-by-trial basis.120 Theyknew what they knew about the length of the sound.Josep Call has approached metacognition from a different angle. He has providedhis subjects with incomplete information to solve a problem, in order to findout whether they would seek additional information: Would they know that theydid not know enough to solve a problem? He tested orangutans, gorillas, chimps,bonobos—and children two and one-half years old.121, 122 He had two opaquetubes. He put a treat in one, either while the subject could see him do it orwhile he was hidden behind a screen. Then he let the subject pick the tube theywanted, either right away or with a time delay. The question was, when theydidn’t have enough information as to which tube had the treat inside, would theyseek more information before choosing a tube? They did! In fact, in many of thetrials, after the apes looked in one tube and saw that it was empty, they chosethe second tube without checking it out first. They inferred that the other tubehad the treat. They were better at this than the children. Preventing the apesfrom immediately choosing increased the looking behavior and obviously theirsuccess. However, this did not change the behavior of the children. Callsuggested that it “is likely that apes were more successful in the delayedsituation because they did not have to inhibit the powerful responses elicitedby the prospect of getting the reward.”122 As we have learned before, inhibitionis not high on the list of chimpanzee behavioral traits.Call is very cautious about his conclusions as to what this study reveals aboutthe cognition of great apes and whether metacognition is involved. The debate iswhether they are using a fixed hardwired rule, such as “Search until you findfood,” or perhaps a fixed rule learned from a specific experience, like “Benddown in the presence of a barrier,” or whether they are using a flexible rulebased on knowledge accumulation created through multiple experiences, none ofwhich were the same as the one that is now being presented, such as “When myvisual access is blocked, then do something appropriate to gain visual access.”Call is inclined toward the latter explanation in his current pursuit of thisquestion.Can anatomy help us at all? Maybe. If we knew exactly what the neural correlatesof human consciousness were, which we don’t, then we could see if theirequivalent exists in other species. It appears that long-range connection loopsare necessary. As I said before, these have been identified in bird brains, andalso in other primates. Although much more work in comparative anatomy stillneeds to be done, we have a problem when we compare anatomy. It is not the samething as comparing function. There may be more than one way to skin a cat—thatis, there may be neural solutions or routes to consciousness other than those inthe human brain, which could result in different types of consciousness.So, currently we are left with Antonio Damasio’s conclusions. Some animals havesome degrees of extended consciousness, but what animals possess it and to whatextent is still unknown. There appears to be some degree of body self-awarenessin a very limited number of species, but even as new ways for testing suchabilities are designed, the many brains that evaluate the tests continue to pokeholes in their validity and also their interpretation. Current evidence suggeststhat animals do not have episodic memory and do not time-travel, but we aregoing to have to keep our eyes on Nicola Clayton and her scrub jays. The lateststudies looking for evidence of animal metacognition in rats are tantalizing butstill need refining before definite conclusions can be drawn.> > CONCLUSIONI was recently asked by a Time magazine reporter, “If we could build a robot oran android that duplicated the processes behind human consciousness, would itactually be conscious?” It is a provocative question and it is one thatpersists, especially as one tries to capture the differences between the spheresof consciousness of animals and also those that exist between separated left andright brains. Much of what I have written here about bisected brains hasappeared before. Yet, I find that the way we all nuance our understanding ofcomplex topics is ever changing, since none of us hold the true answers in ourhip pocket. I found myself answering the reporter with what I feel is a newtwist.Underlying this question is the assumption that consciousness reflects some kindof process that brings all of our zillions of thoughts into a special energy andreality called personal or phenomenal consciousness. That is not how it works.Consciousness is an emergent property and not a process in and of itself. Whenone tastes salt, for example, the consciousness of taste is an emergent propertyof the sensory system, not of the combination of elements that make up tablesalt. Our cognitive capacities, memories, dreams, and so on reflect distributedprocesses throughout the brain, and each of those entities produces its ownemergent states of consciousness.In closing, remember this one fact. A split-brain patient, a human who has hadthe two halves of his brain disconnected from each other, does not find one sideof the brain missing the other. The left brain has lost all consciousness aboutthe mental processes managed by the right brain, and vice versa. It is just aswith aging or with focal neurologic disease. We don’t miss what we no longerhave access to. The emergent conscious state arises out of each capacity andprobably through neural circuits local to the capacity in question. If they aredisconnected or damaged, there is no underlying circuitry from which theemergent property arises.The thousands or millions of conscious moments that we each have reflect one ofour networks being “up for duty.” These networks are all over the place, not inone specific location. When one finishes, the next one pops up. The pipeorgan–like device plays its tune all day long. What makes emergent humanconsciousness so vibrant is that our pipe organ has lots of tunes to play,whereas the rat’s has few. And the more we know, the richer the concert."},{"pageContent":"PART 4 [Human_split_003.html#filepos5140]"},{"pageContent":"BEYOND CURRENT CONSTRAINTS [Human_split_003.html#filepos5140]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 [Human_split_003.html#filepos5439]"},{"pageContent":"WHO NEEDS FLESH?

FYBORGS, OR FUNCTIONAL cyborgs, are biologicalorganisms functionally supplemented with technological extensions.1 Forinstance, shoes. Wearing shoes has not been a problem for most people. In fact,it has solved many problems, such as walking on gravelly surfaces, avoidingthorns in the foot, walking at high noon across an asphalt parking lot on a Juneday in Phoenix, or a January day in Duluth, and shoes have prevented over onemillion stubbed toes in the last month. In general, no one is going to get upsetabout the existence and use of shoes. Man’s ingenuity came up with a tool tomake life easier and more pleasant. After the inventors and engineers were donewith the concept, the basic design, and product development, the aestheticsdepartment took over, cranked it around a bit, and came up with high heels.Perhaps not so utilitarian, but they serve a different, more specific purpose:to get across that parking lot looking sexy.Wearing clothes has also been well accepted. They provide protection both fromthe cold and the sun, from thorns and brush, and can cover up years’ worth ofunsightly intake errors. Watches, a handy tool, are used by quite a few peoplewithout any complaint, and are now usually run by a small computer worn on thewrist. Eyeglasses and contact lenses are common. There was no big revolutionwhen those were introduced. Cell phones seem to be surgically attached to thepalms of teenagers and, for that matter, most everyone else. Fashioning toolsthat make life easier is what humans have always done. For thousands of years,we humans have been fyborgs, a term coined by Alexander Chislenko, who was anartificial-intelligence theorist, researcher, and software designer for variousprivate companies and MIT. The first caveman that slapped a piece of animal hideacross the bottom of his foot and refused to leave home without it became afyborg to a limited degree. Chislenko devised a self-test for functionalcyborgization: > Are you dependent on technology to the extent that you could not survive> without it?> > Would you reject a lifestyle free of any technology even if you could endure> it?> > Would you feel embarrassed and “dehumanized” if somebody removed your> artificial covers (clothing) and exposed your natural biological body in> public?> > Do you consider your bank deposits a more important personal resource storage> system than your fat deposits?> > Do you identify yourself and judge other people more by possessions, ability> to manipulate tools and positions in the technological and social systems than> primary biological features?> > Do you spend more time thinking about—and discussing—your external> “possessions” and “accessories” than your internal “parts”?1 I don’t know about you, but I would much rather hear about my friend’s newMaserati than his liver. Call me a fyborg any day.Cyborgs, on the other hand, have a physical integration of biological andtechnological structures. And we now have a few in our midst. Going beyond themanufacture of tools, humans have gotten into the business of aftermarket bodyparts. Want to upgrade that hip or knee? Hop up on this table. Lost an arm?Let’s see what we can do to help you out. But things start getting a little bitdicier when we get to the world of implants. Replacement hips and knees are OK,but start a discussion about breast implants, and you may end up with a livelyor heated debate about a silicon upgrade. Enhancement gets the ire up in somepeople. Why is that? What is wrong with a body upgrade?We get into even choppier waters when we start talking about neural implants.Some people fear that tinkering with the brain by use of neural prostheses maythreaten personal identity. What is a neural prosthesis? It’s a device implantedto restore a lost or altered neural function. It may be either on the input side(sensory input coming into the brain) or the output side (translating neuronalsignals into actions). Currently the most successful neural implant has beenused to restore auditory sensory perception: the cochlear implant.Until recently, “artifacts” or tools that man has created have been directed tothe external world. More recently, therapeutic implants—such as artificialjoints, cardiac pacemakers, drugs, and physical enhancements—have been usedeither below the neck or for facial cosmetic purposes (that would include hairtransplants). Today, we are using therapeutic implants above the neck. We areusing them in the brain. We also are using therapeutic medications that affectthe brain to treat mental illness, anxiety, and mood disorders. Things arechanging, and they are changing rapidly. Technological and scientific advancesin many areas, including genetics, robotics, and computer technology, arepredicted to set about a revolution of change such as humans have neverexperienced before, change that may well affect what it means to behuman—changes that we hope will improve our lives, our societies, and the world.Ray Kurzweil, a researcher in artificial intelligence, makes the point thatknowledge in these areas is increasing at an exponential rate, not at a linearrate.2 This is what you would like your stock price to do. The classic exampleof exponential growth is the story about the smart peasant of whom we learned inmath class—the guy who worked a deal with a math-challenged king for a grain ofrice on the first square of a chessboard, and to have it doubled on the second,and so on, until by the time the king had reached the end of the chessboard, hehad lost his kingdom and then some. Across the first row or two of thechessboard things progressed rather slowly, but there came a point where thedoubling was a hefty change.In 1965, Gordon Moore, one of the cofounders of Intel, the world’s largestsemiconductor manufacturing company, made the observation that the number oftransistors on an integrated circuit for minimum component cost doubles everytwenty-four months. That means that every twenty-four months they could doublethe number of transistors on a circuit without increasing the cost. That isexponential growth. Carver Mead, a professor at Caltech, dubbed this observationMoore’s law, and it has been viewed both as a prediction and a goal for growthin the technology industry. It continues to be fulfilled. In the last sixtyyears, computation speed, measured in what are known as floating pointoperations per second (FLOPS), has increased from 1 FLOPS to over 250 trillionFLOPS! As Henry Markram, project director of IBM’s Blue Brain project (which wewill talk about later), states, this is “by far the largest man-made growth rateof any kind in the ~10,000 years of human civilization.”3 The graph ofexponential change, instead of gradually increasing continually as a lineargraph would, gradually increases until a critical point is reached and thenthere is an upturn such that the line becomes almost vertical. This “knee” inthe graph is where Kurzweil thinks we currently are in the rate of change thatwill occur owing to the knowledge gained in these areas. He thinks we are notaware of it or prepared for it because we have been in the more slowlyprogressing earlier stage of the graph and have been lulled into thinking thatthe rate of change is linear.What are the big changes that we aren’t prepared for? What do they have to dowith the unique qualities of being human? You aren’t going to believe them if wedon’t work up to them slowly, so that is what we are going to do.> > SILICON-BASED AIDS: THE COCHLEAR IMPLANT STORYCochlear implants have helped hundreds of thousands of people with severehearing problems (due to the loss of hair cells in the inner ear, which areresponsible for transmitting but also augmenting or decreasing auditory stimuli)for whom a typical hearing aid does not help. In fact, a child who has been borndeaf and has the implants placed at an early enough age (eighteen to twenty-fourmonths being optimal) will be able to learn to speak normally, and although hishearing may not be perfect, it will be quite functional. Wonderful as this maysound, in the 1990s, many people in the deaf community worried that cochlearimplants might adversely affect deaf culture and that, rather than a therapeuticintervention, the devices were a weapon being wielded by the medical communityto commit cultural genocide against the deaf community. Some considered hearingan enhancement, an additional capability on top of what other members of thecommunity had, gained by artificial means. Although people with cochlearimplants can still use sign language, apparently they are not always welcome.4Could this reaction be a manifestation of Richard Wragham’s theory, which welearned about in chapter 2, that humans are a party-gang species within-group/out-group bias? This attitude has slowly been changing but is stillheld by many.To understand cochlear implants, and all neuroprosthetics, it is important toalso understand that the body runs on electricity. David Bodanis, in his bookElectric Universe, gives us a vivid description: “Our entire body operates byelectricity. Gnarled living electrical cables extend into the depths of ourbrains; intense electric and magnetic force fields stretch into our cells,flinging food or neurotransmitters across microscopic barrier membranes; evenour DNA is controlled by potent electrical forces.”5> > A DIGRESSION ON ELECTRIC CITYThe physiology of the brain and central nervous system has been a challenge tounderstand. We haven’t talked much about physiology, but it is the structureunderneath all that occurs in the body and brain. All theories of the brain’smechanisms must have an understanding of the physiology as their foundation. Theelectrical nature of the body and brain is perhaps most easily digested bit bybit and, luckily for our digestion, the continuing unfolding story began in oneof the most tasty cities of the world, Bologna, Italy. In 1791, Luigi Galvani, aphysician and physicist, hung a frog’s leg out on his iron balcony rail. He hadhung it with a copper wire. The dang thing started twitching. Something wasgoing on between those two metals. He zapped another frog’s leg with a bit ofelectricity, and it twitched. After further investigation, he suggested thatnerve and muscle could generate their own electrical current, and that was whatcaused them to twitch. Galvani thought the electricity came from the muscle, buthis intellectual sparring partner, physicist Alessandro Volta, who hailed fromthe southern reaches of Lake Como, was more on the mark, thinking thatelectricity inside and outside the body was much the same type ofelectrochemical reaction occurring between metals.Nearly a hundred years go by, and another physician and physicist, from Germany,Hermann von Helmholtz, who was into everything from visual and auditoryperception to chemical thermodynamics and the philosophy of science, figured outa bit more. That electrical current was no by-product of cellular activity; itwas what was actually carrying messages along the axon of the nerve cell. Healso figured out that even though the speed at which those electrical messages(signals) were conducted was far slower than in a copper wire, the nerve signalsmaintained their strength, but those in the copper did not. What was going on?Well, in wire, signals are propagated passively, so that must not be what isgoing on with nerve cells. Von Helmholtz found that the signals were beingpropagated by a wavelike action that went as fast as ninety feet per second.Well, Helmholtz had done his bit and passed the problem on.How did those signals get propagated? Helmholtz’s former assistant, JuliusBernstein, was all over this problem and came up with the membrane theory,published in 1902. Half of it has proven true; the other half, not quite.When a nerve axon is at rest, there is a 70-millivolt voltage difference betweenthe inside and the outside of the membrane surrounding it, with the insidehaving a greater negative charge. This voltage difference across the membrane isknown as the resting membrane potential.When you get a blood panel done, part of what is being checked are yourelectrolyte levels. Electrolytes are electrically charged atoms (ions) ofsodium, potassium, and chlorine. Your cells are sitting in a bath of this stuff,but ions are also inside the cells, and it is the difference in theirconcentrations inside and outside of the cell that constitutes the voltagedifference.Outside the cell are positively charged sodium ions (atoms that are short anelectron) balanced by negatively charged chloride ions (chlorine atoms carryingan extra electron). Inside the cell, there is a lot of protein, which isnegatively charged, balanced by positively charged potassium ions. However,since the inside of the cell has an overall negative charge, not all the proteinis being balanced by potassium. What’s up with that? Bernstein flung caution tothe wind and suggested that there were selectively permeable pores (now calledion channels), which allowed only potassium to flow in and out. The potassiumflows out of the cell and remains near the outside of the cell membrane, makingit more positively charged, while the excess of negatively charged protein ionsmake the inside surface of the membrane negatively charged. This creates thevoltage difference at rest.But what happens when the neuron fires off a signal (which is called an actionpotential)? Bernstein proposed that for a fraction of a second the membraneloses its selective permeability, letting any ion cross it. Ions would then flowinto and out of the cell, neutralizing the charge and bringing the restingpotential to zero. No big fancy biochemical reactions were needed, just ionconcentration gradients. This second part later needed to be tweaked a bit, butfirst we encounter another physician and scientist, Keith Lucas.In 1905, Lucas demonstrated that nerve impulses worked on an all-or-none basis.There is a certain threshold of stimulation that is needed for a nerve torespond, and once that threshold is reached, the nerve cell gives its all. Iteither fires fully, or it does not fire: all or nothin,’ baby. Increasing thestimulus does not increase the intensity of the nerve impulse. With one of hisstudents, Baron Edgar Adrian, he discussed trying to record action potentialsfrom nerves, but World War I intervened, and Lucas died in an airplane accident.Adrian spent World War I treating soldiers for nerve damage and shell shock, andwhen it ended, he returned to his alma mater, Cambridge, to take over Lucas’slab and study nerve impulses. Adrian set out to record those propagated signals,the action potentials, and in doing so, found out a wealth of information andbagged a Nobel Prize along the way.Adrian found that all action potentials produced by a nerve cell are the same.If the threshold has been reached for generating the signal, it fires with thesame intensity, no matter what the location, strength, or duration of thestimulus is. So an action potential is an action potential is an actionpotential. You’ve seen one, you’ve seen them all. Now this was a bit puzzling.If the action potentials were always the same, how could different messages besent? How were stimuli distinguished? How could you tell the difference betweena flaccid and a firm handshake, between a sunny day and a moonlit night, betweena dog bark and a dog bite?Baron Adrian discovered that the frequency of the action potentials isdetermined by the intensity of the stimulus. If it is a mild stimulus, such as afeather touching your skin, you get only a couple of action potentials, but ifit is a hard pinch, you can get hundreds. The duration of a stimulus determineshow long the potentials are generated. If, however, the stimulus is constant,although the action potentials remain constant in strength, they graduallyreduce in frequency, and the sensation is diminished. And the subject of thestimulus, whether it is perceptual (visual, olfactory, etc.) or motor, isdetermined by the type of nerve fiber that is stimulated, its pathway, and itsfinal destination in the brain. Adrian also figured out something cool about thesomatosensory cortex, the destination of all those perception neurons. Differentmammals have different amounts of somatosensory cortex for differentperceptions: Different species do not have equal sensory abilities; it alldepends on how big an area in their somatosensory cortex is for a specificability.This also applies to the motor cortex. Pigs, for instance, have most of theirsomatosensory cortex dedicated to their snout. Ponies and sheep also have a bignostril area; it is as large as the area for the entire rest of their bodies.Mice have a huge whisker area, and raccoons have 60 percent of their neocortexdevoted to their fingers and palm. We primates have big hand and face areas, forboth sensation and motor movement. You get more bang for your buck when youtouch something with your index finger than when you use other parts of yourbody. This is why when you touch an object with your finger in the dark, you aremore likely to be able to determine what it is than if you touch it with yourback. It is also why you have such dexterous hands and such an expressive face.However, we will never know what it is like to have the perceptions of a pig.Although the basic physiology is the same, the hookups and the motor andsomatosensory areas are different among mammalian species. Part of our uniqueabilities and experiences, and the uniqueness of every animal species, lies inthe makeup of the motor and somatosensory cortex.Next, Alan Hodgkin, one of Adrian’s students, figured out that the currentgenerated by the action potential was more than enough to excite an actionpotential in the next segment of an axon. Each action potential had more powerthan it needed to spark the next one. So they could perpetuate themselvesforever. This was why, once generated, they didn’t lose their strength. Later,Hodgkin and one of his students (are you following the genealogy?), AndrewHuxley, tweaked Bernstein’s membrane theory, and also received a Nobel Prize fortheir work. Studying the gigantic squid neuron, the largest of all neurons(picture a strand of spaghettini), they were able to record action potentialsfrom inside and outside the cell. They confirmed the–70-millivolt differencethat Bernstein had proposed, but found that in the action potential, there wasactually a 110-millivolt change, and the inside of the cell ended up with apositive charge of 40 millivolts, not the neutral state that Bernstein hadsupposed.Somehow, excess positive ions were getting in and staying in the cell. Hodgkinand Huxley suggested that the selectively permeable membrane was alsoselectively permeable in a second way. It turns out that there is another set ofpores, which they called voltage-gated channels, that selectively let in sodiumions when the membrane is stimulated enough, but they let them in for only athousandth of a second. Then they slam closed, and the other set opens, lettingpotassium out, and then they slam closed too—all regulated by the changing ionvoltage gradients across the cell membrane. Then, since the inside of the cellnow has excess sodium, a protein binds to it and carries it out of the cell.This propagating action potential gets passed along from one end of an axon tothe other. With the advent of molecular biology, more has been learned. Thoseion channels are actually proteins that surround the cell membrane; they havefluid-filled pores that allow the ions to pass through.So it is electrical current that conducts an impulse along the length of a nerveaxon. However, no electricity passes from one neuron to the next, although thishad been thought to be the case for many years. Rather, it is chemicals thattransmit a signal from one neuron to the next across a tiny gap, called thesynapse. These chemicals are now known as neurotransmitters. Theneurotransmitter chemical binds to the protein on the synaptic membrane, thebinding causes the protein to open its ion channel, and that sets in motion theaction potential along the next nerve axon. OK, back to our story of neuralimplants.> > THE RAGING BULLElectrical stimulation of the brain was pioneered by José Delgado, aneuroscientist who in 1963 put his money where his mouth was. In a reactionagainst the increasing practice of lobotomy and “psychosurgery” in the late1940s and early 1950s, he determined to find a more conservative way of treatingmental illness, and decided to investigate electrical stimulation. Luckily hewas technologically gifted. He developed the first electronic brain implant,which he placed in different brain regions of various animals. By pressing abutton that controlled the implanted electrical stimulator, he would getdifferent reactions, depending on where it was implanted. Quite sure of histechnology and the information that he had learned from it, he stood in a bullring at a ranch in Córdoba, Spain, one day in 1963 facing a charging bull withonly the stimulator button in his hand and an itchy trigger finger. Theelectrical stimulator itself was implanted into a part of the charging bull’sbrain known as the caudate nucleus. A gentle tap brought the bull to a skiddingstop just feet in front of him.6 The button and his theories worked! He hadturned off the bull’s aggression, and it stood placidly in front of him. Withthis demonstration, Delgado put neural implants on the map.> > Back to the Cochlear ImplantSo far, the cochlear implant is the most successful neural implant. A tinymicrophone about the size of a small button is worn externally, usually behindthe ear. This attaches magnetically to an internal processor that is surgicallyimplanted under the scalp. A tunnel is drilled through the skull to the cochlea,and a wire is fed from the processor through the tunnel and into the cochlea,which is shaped like one of those twisty seashells. The microphone, made ofmetal backed by a plastic plate, acts like the eardrum. When the metal vibratesfrom incoming sound waves, it creates an electrical charge in the plastic, thusconverting the sound to electricity, which then travels down a wire to a smallportable computer that is worn on the belt. This computer converts theelectrical charges to digital representations of what the electrical chargesrepresent acoustically; it runs on software that is continually being fine-tunedand improved. The software can adjust audio frequency ranges and volume topersonal preferences.Let’s just say this software is very complex and is the result of years ofresearch in sound waves and frequencies and how to code them, as well as thephysiology of the cochlea. The processed signal is then sent back up the wire tothe external button containing the microphone. But the microphone is not homealone. There is also a tiny radio transmitter, which transmits the signal asradio waves through the skin to the internal processor, where it is reconvertedback to electricity by a diode. In the processor are up to twenty-two electrodesthat correspond to different audio frequencies. The electrical signal fires upthe electrodes in different combinations according to the message that thesoftware has encoded, and the end result is then signaled down the wire into thecochlea, where it electrically stimulates the auditory nerve. This whole processtakes four milliseconds!* [Human_split_111.html#filepos1453560] It does notprovide perfect hearing; voices sound mechanical. The brain has to learn thatcertain sounds may not correspond to what they sounded like in the past. Also,after a sound has been learned, a software upgrade may change that sound toactually become more realistic, but the wearer now has to readjust to the soundand its significance.Why am I telling you all this? Because here we have the first successfulneuroprosthetic in a human: a merging of silicon with carbon, forming what manyconsider is the first truly cybernetic organism.Manfred Clynes and Nathan Cline coined the word cyborg to describe theinteraction of artificial and biological components in a single “cyberneticorganism.” Their aim was to describe an organism built for space travel. Viewingspace as an environment that humans were not adapted for, they suggested, “Thetask of adapting man’s body to any environment he may choose will be made easierby increased knowledge of homeostatic functioning, the cybernetic aspects ofwhich are just beginning to be understood and investigated. In the past,evolution brought about the altering of bodily functions to suit differentenvironments. Starting as of now, it will be possible to achieve this to somedegree without alteration of heredity by suitable biochemical, physiological,and electronic modifications of man’s existing modus vivendi.”7That was 1960, and this is now, and it is happening. To some extent, we canchange man’s existing state without changing his heredity. We have been doingthis with drugs to treat physical and mental states that occur in our adaptedenvironment, and now, sophisticated physical apparatuses are also being used. Ifyou were born deaf, that can be changed. And some researchers predict that itmay be in the not so far future (less than forty years), if you were born not soswift, mentally or physically, that will be able to be changed. There is eventhe possibility that if you were born a psychopath, that could be changed, too.Just how much we will be able to tinker with such matters and how extensive thepossible changes to one’s current physical and mental states will be arecurrently matters of intense speculation.With a cochlear implant, a mechanical device has taken over one of the brain’sfunctions. Silicon has been substituted for carbon. It is a little differentfrom a heart pacemaker, which stimulates the cardiac muscle to contract. This isdirectly connected to the brain, and the software determines what is heard. Theconspiracy crowd may get a little agitated by this, because the softwaredeveloper determines what is being heard. Is it ethical to use cochlearimplants? Most people do not have a problem with them. Although the wearer maydepend on a computer for part of his brain processing, Michael Chorost haswritten that although he is now a cyborg, his cochlear implant has made him morehuman,8 allowing him to be more social and participate in a community. Peoplewith normal hearing do not think of the cochlear implant as an enhancement. Theythink of it as a therapeutic intervention. One ethical question that arises is,What if in the future such implants or other devices allow you to havesuperhuman hearing, hearing enhancement? What if such an implant allows one tohear frequencies the human ear cannot hear? Is that OK too? Would hearing morefrequencies provide a survival advantage? Would you be less of a person or lesssuccessful if everyone around you had one and you didn’t? Will you have toupgrade to silicon to survive? These are the questions we are going to befacing, and they don’t concern only sensory enhancements.> > Artificial RetinasProgress toward retinal implants has been slower. There are two questions thatremain unanswered: How many electrodes will be necessary for the retinal implantto provide useful vision? And how much sight must they generate for it to beuseful? Is being able to navigate enough, or must one be able to see well enoughto read? Experimental retinal implants that have been tested on humans have onlysixteen electrodes, and the vision they provide is only spots of light. A secondimplant that is not yet ready for human testing has sixty-four electrodes. Noone knows how many electrodes will be necessary to provide adequate vision. Itmay well be that for vision, hundreds or thousands of electrodes will be needed,and their development will be dependent on the continuing advancements innanotechnology and the miniaturizing of the electrode arrays. Rodney Brooks, aleader in the robotics world, sees the possibility of retinal implants beingadapted for night vision, infrared vision, or ultraviolet vision.9 One day youmay be able to trade in one good eye for one of these implants to enhance yourvision beyond that of natural humans.> > Locked-In SyndromeOne of the most terrifying brain injuries that a person can sustain is a lesionto the ventral part of the pons in the brain stem. These people are awake andconscious and intelligent but can’t move any skeletal muscles. That also meansthat they can’t talk or eat or drink. This is known as locked-in syndrome. Theones who are lucky, if you can call it that, can voluntarily blink or move theireyes, and this is how they communicate. Lou Gehrig’s disease (amyotrophiclateral sclerosis, or ALS) can also result in this syndrome. Phil Kennedy, aneurologist at Emory University, came up with a technology he felt could helpthese people. After successful trials in rats and monkeys, he was given the OKto try it in humans.In 1998, for the first time, Kennedy implanted an electrode made up of a tinyhollow glass cone attached to two gold wires. The electrode is coated withneurotrophic factor, which encourages brain cells to grow into the tube and holdit stable in the brain. The electrode is implanted in the left-hand motor regionof the brain and picks up the electrical impulses the brain generates. Thepatient imagines moving his left hand, and the electrode picks up the electricalimpulse that this thought produces. The electrical impulse travels down the twowires, which are connected to an amplifier and an FM transmitter outside theskull but under the scalp. The transmitter signals to a receiver external to thescalp. These signals are routed to the patient’s computer, interpreted andconverted by software, and end by moving the cursor on the computer screen.Kennedy’s first patients were able, after extensive training, to imagine movingtheir left hand and thereby move the cursor on the computer screen!10, 11 Thiswas and still is truly amazing. He had captured electrical impulses generated bythinking about a movement and translated them into movement by a computercursor. It requires huge processing power.12 A myriad of neural signals must besorted through to remove “noise,” the remaining electrical activity must bedigitized, and decoding algorithms must process the neural activity into acommand signal—all in a few milliseconds. The result is a command that thecomputer can respond to.This is all based upon an implant that can survive in the salty sea-likeenvironment inside the body without corroding, transmit electrical signalswithout producing toxic by-products, and remain cool enough to avoid cooking thenearby neurons. This was not an easy assignment. This is an incredible firststep, which actually, of course, was not the first step but one based onhundreds of thousands of other steps. And one electrode doesn’t provide a lot ofinformation. It took the patient months to learn how to use it, and the cursorcould only move horizontally, but the concept worked. There are several groupsapproaching this drawing board from different angles.13This type of device is known as a brain-computer interface (BCI). Unlike thecochlear implant, which is supplying sensory input information to the brain,BCIs work on the output from the brain. They pick up electrical potentialsgenerated in the brain as a by-product of neuronal activity and translate theneuronal signals into electrical impulses that can control the computercursor—or, in the future, other devices.> > BASIC-SCIENCE BREAKTHROUGHSIn 1991, Peter Fromherz of the Max Planck Institute in Germany succeeded indeveloping a neuron-silicon junction. This was between an insulated transistorand a Retzius cell of a leech,14 and was the beginning of actual brain-computerinterfaces. The problem that had to be surmounted was that although computersand brains both work electrically, their charge carriers are different. It’sroughly like trying to hook up your gas stove to an electric line. Electronscarry the charge in the solid silicon of the chip, and ions (atoms or moleculesthat have gained or lost an electron) do the job in liquid water for thebiological brain. Semiconductor chips also have to be protected from corrosionin the body’s saltwater environment, as anyone who has ever worked or lived bythe ocean knows. Fromherz’s “intellectual and technological challenge” was tojoin these different systems directly at the level of electronic and ionicsignals.15This technology has allowed another lab more recently to implant a differentsystem, called the BrainGate system, developed by John P. Donoghue at BrownUniversity, using a neural implant developed by Richard Normann at theUniversity of Utah. The implant, known as the Utah electrode array, wasoriginally designed to be used in the visual cortex, but Donoghue thought itwould work as well in the motor cortex. In 2004, an implant with ninety-sixelectrodes was surgically inserted into Matthew Nagle, a quadriplegic patientwho had been stabbed in the neck at a Fourth of July celebration three yearsbefore while coming to the aid of a friend. Since this patient had beenquadriplegic for a few years, no one knew if the part of his brain thatcontrolled his motor system would still respond or whether it would haveatrophied from disuse. However, he began to respond right away.It was also easier to use than Kennedy’s implant. Nagle didn’t need severalmonths of training before he was able to control it. Just by thinking about it,he was able to open simulated e-mail and draw an approximately circular figureon the computer screen using a paint program. He could adjust the volume,channel, and power on his television, and play video games, such as Pong. Aftera few trials, he was also able to open and close a robotic prosthetic hand byjust looking at the hand, and he used a simple multijointed robotic limb tograsp an object and transport it from one location to another.16 This was notdone easily or smoothly, but it was possible. Obviously this is huge. Anythingthat gives such people any degree of control over their environment ismomentous. The system still has many bugs to be worked out. When the patientwants to use the system, a cable that leads to the bulky external processingequipment must be attached to a connecter on his skull. Each time it is turnedon, a technician has to recalibrate the system. And, of course, the electrodearray in the brain is no small potatoes. The risk of infection is ever present,as are the probability of scar tissue eventually causing the implant to losefunction, the risk of causing more damage with insertion or movement of thearray, and its possible malfunction.How can a chip with only ninety-six electrodes code for the movement of an arm?The idea that recording the firing of just a few neurons could accomplish amotor activity came from Apostolos Georgopoulos, a neurophysiologist currentlyat the University of Minnesota. He had observed that an individual nerve cellperforms more than one function. A single neuron fires for more than onedirection of movement, but has a preferred direction of movement.17 It turnedout that the frequency that it was firing determined the direction of themuscle’s movement: If more frequently, it was moving in one direction; less, inanother—a bit like Morse code of the brain. Georgopoulos found that through avector analysis (not everyone has forgotten their high school trig class) of thefiring frequency and preferred direction of firing, he could accurately predictthe direction of muscular movement.18 He also suggested that recording only afew neurons, between 100 and 150, would produce fairly accurate predictions ofmovement in three-dimensional space.19 This made using a small electrode panelfeasible in recording neuronal intentions.For a locked-in patient, or a paralyzed patient, more autonomy would includefeeding himself and being able to get a glass of water without calling forassistance. Controlling a robotic arm to perform these tasks would be great.However, there are still many limiting factors to these systems. Withoutenumerating all the bugs, one obvious factor is that they are open-loop systems.Information goes out, but none comes back in. In order for a person to be ableto control a prosthetic arm to drink a cup of coffee or feed himself at his ownpace, sensory information needs to be sent back to the brain to prevent the manya slip ’twixt cup and lip. Anyone who has done the Mr. Small skit knows aboutthis problem.* [Human_split_112.html#filepos1454383]The input problem is a complicated business. No one quite knows all the ins andouts of how proprioception works. In addition, there is the need for sensoryinformation, such as how firmly one is grasping a cup, its weight, temperature,and whether it is following a smooth trajectory to the mouth. There is hope thatif this information can be programmed into a prosthetic arm, perhaps the realarm could be programmed and directed too. The arm would have its nervesconnected to chips that receive signals from the implants in the brain directingits movement, but also incoming sensory signals would be decoded by the chip andsent to the brain to give it feedback. In this way, the implant would serve as abridge to bypass the severed nerves.The human arm, however, which we take for granted as we reach for a cup of javaor twist a little pasta onto a fork, that whole shoulder-elbow-wrist-hand withall its fingers and network of bones, nerves, tendons, muscles, and ligaments,is immensely complicated. Muscles are flexing and extending together, beingstimulated and inhibited, twisting and adjusting their movement constantly, allat varying velocities, all with sensory, proprioceptive, cognitive, and painfeedbacks to the brain telling it the muscles’ position, force, stretch, andvelocity. The sensory system actually is sending back to the brain about tentimes the information the motor system is sending out. The current implants areobviously still quite crude, but they are being improved every year, beingreduced in size and given more capacity, just as personal computers have gottensmaller and faster with more memory. But the idea works. Neurons in your braincan grow onto a computer chip and transfer neuronal signals to it. There can besilicon replacement parts for the brain.Richard Andersen, a professor of neuroscience at Caltech, has another idea. Hethinks instead of using the motor cortex as the site to capture neuronalfirings, it would be better and easier to go back up to a higher cortical areawhere the visual feedback is processed and the planning for the movement ismade—the parietal cortex.20 The posterior parietal cortex is situated betweenthe sensory and the motor regions and serves as a bridge from sensation toaction. His lab has found that an anatomical map of plans exists within thisarea, with one part devoted to planning eye movements and another part toplanning arm movements.21, 22 The action plans in the arm-movement area exist ina cognitive form, specifying the goal of the intended movement rather thanparticular signals for all the biomechanical movements. The parietal lobe says,“Get that piece of chocolate into my mouth,” but does not detail all the motionsthat are necessary: “First extend the shoulder joint, by flexing the blah blahblah….” All these detailed movements are encoded in the motor cortex. Andersenand his colleagues are working on a neural prosthesis for paralyzed patientsthat records the electrical activity of nerve cells in the posterior parietalcortex. Such an implant would interpret and transmit the patients’ intentions:“Get the coffee to my mouth.” They think this will be much easier for softwareprogrammers. These neural signals are decoded using computer algorithms, and areconverted into electrical control signals to operate external devices such as arobot arm, an autonomous vehicle, or a computer. The robotic arm or vehiclewould simply receive the input as a goal—chocolate in mouth—leaving thedetermination of how to accomplish the goal to the other systems, such as smartrobotic controllers. Smart robots? We’ll get there soon. This bypasses the needfor a closed-loop system. This system also needs relatively few neurons to senda signal.23Brain surgery, implants, infection—can’t they figure out something that doesn’trequire going inside the head? Can’t they use EEGs?Jonathan Wolpaw, chief of the Laboratory of Nervous System Disorders of the NewYork State Department of Health and State University of New York, thinks so. Hehas been working on this problem for the last twenty years. When he first began,he had to figure out if the idea of using brain waves captured externally waspossible. He made a headset with a series of external electrodes positioned overthe motor cortex, where neurons fire to initiate movement. These neurons giveoff weak electrical signals that the electrodes pick up. Getting useful signalsfrom “a few amplitudes of scalp-recorded EEG rhythms that reflect in a noisy anddegraded fashion the combined activity of many millions of neurons andsynapses”24 was difficult. After several years, he was able to show that peoplecould learn to control their brain waves to move a computer cursor. The softwarefor this system has been many years in development. The headset electrodes pickup the signals, and because the strength of the signals varies from person toperson, and from one part of the cortex to another, the software is constantlysurveying the different electrodes for the strongest signals, giving those thegreatest influence in the decision-making process as to which way a cursorshould move.Scott Hamel, one of the subjects who test Wolpaw’s system, says it is easiest touse when he is fully relaxed. If he tries too hard, has other things on hismind, or gets frustrated and tense, things don’t go as well.4 Too many neuronsare competing for attention. Wolpaw and his group, and others who have taken upthe challenge, have found that “a variety of different brain signals, recordedin a variety of different ways and analyzed with a variety of differentalgorithms, can support some degree of real-time communication and control.”25However, there is a big problem, and it is not just with externally controlledBCIs. It is also true of the implants. Even in controlled conditions, theresults are variable. Users are better on some days than others, and performancecan vary widely even within a single session and from trial to trial. Cursormovements are slow and jerky, described by some as ataxic.24 Wolpaw thinks thisproblem is going to persist unless researchers take into account the fact thatBCIs ask the brain to do something entirely new.This becomes clear if you look at what the brain normally does to producemovement and how it normally does it. The job of the central nervous system(CNS) is to convert sensory inputs into appropriate motor outputs. This job ofcreating motor outputs is a concerted effort of the entire CNS from the cerebralcortex to the spinal cord. No single area is wholly responsible for an action.Whether you walk, talk, high jump, or bronco bust, there is a collaborationamong areas, from the sensory neurons up the spinal cord to the brain stem andeventually to the cortex and back down through the basal ganglia, thalamicnuclei, cerebellum, brain-stem nuclei, and spinal cord to the interneurons andmotor neurons. And even though the motor action is smooth and consistent fromone time to the next, the activity in all those different brain areas may notbe. However, when a BCI is being used, it is a whole new ball game. Motoractions, which are normally produced by spinal motor neurons, are now beingproduced by the neurons that normally just contribute to the control of themotor neurons. Now they are putting on the whole show. They have to do their ownjob and assume the role normally performed by spinal motor neurons; theiractivity becomes the final product, the output, of the entire CNS. They aredoing it all.The brain has some plasticity, but there are limits. Wolpaw makes the point thatBCIs provide new output pathways for the brain, but the brain has to learn them.The brain has to change the way it normally functions. He thinks that in orderto make BCIs perform better, researchers have to make it easier for the brain toimplement these new output pathways. An output pathway can either control aprocess or select a goal. He also thinks that outputting a goal is easier. Justtell the software the goal, and let it do all the work. Wolpaw is walking intoAndersen’s camp.This technology has not been overlooked by the business world. There arecompanies that have come up with their own versions that are being developed forplaying computer games. One company, Emotiv, has a sixteen-sensor strap-onheadset that they claim reads emotions, thoughts, and facial expressions.According to the company, it is the first brain-computer interface that candetect human conscious thoughts and nonconscious emotions. Its current gamingapplication allows for 3-D characters to reflect the player’s expressions: Youwink, it winks; you smile, it smiles. It also allows the manipulation of virtualobjects using the player’s thoughts.Another company, NeuroSky, has come up with a single-electrode device that theyclaim will read emotions as its software translates them to commands to controla game. Other companies are developing NeuroSky’s technology to use incell-phone headsets and MP3 players. The sensor will sense your emotional stateand pick music that is compatible with it. No downer songs while you are feelingfine, or for those slow-to-wake-up folks; no heavy metal until after 11:00 A.M.Just exactly what is being recorded and used is, of course, not being revealedby either company.> > Aiding Faulty Memories with SiliconAnother problem begging for a solution has to do with the increasing elderlypopulation: memory loss. The normal slow loss of memory is annoying enoughwithout the devastating problem of Alzheimer’s disease. Although the neuronalimplants that we have discussed have to do with sensory or motor functions,other researchers are concerned with restoring cognitive loss of higher-levelthought processes. Theodore Berger at USC has been interested in memory and thehippocampus for years, and more recently he has been working toward creating aprosthesis that will perform the services that Alzheimer’s disease plays havocwith: the transfer of information from immediate memory to long-term memory. Thehippocampus has a star role in the formation of new memories about experiencedevents, as evidenced by the fact that damage to the hippocampus usually resultsin profound difficulties in forming new memories and also affects retrieval ofmemories formed prior to the damage. It doesn’t look as if procedural memory,such as learning how to play an instrument, is part of the hippocampus’s jobdescription, for it is not affected by damage to the hippocampus.The hippocampus is located deep in the brain and is evolutionarily old, whichmeans that it is present in less-evolved animals. Its connections, however, areless complicated than other parts of the brain, and this makes Berger’s goal atad (and only a tad) easier. Just what the damaged cells in the hippocampus didis still up to conjecture, but that doesn’t slow down Berger and his big plan todevelop a chip for people with this type of memory loss. He doesn’t think heneeds to know exactly what they did. He thinks all he has to do is provide thebridge between the input of cells on one side and the output of cells on theother side of the damaged cells.Not that that is a walk in the park. He has to figure out from an electricalinput pattern what the output pattern should be. For instance, let’s say thatyou were a telegraph operator who translates Morse code from one language toanother. The problem is, you don’t know or understand either of the languages orcodes. You receive a code tapped out in Romanian and then have to translate itand tap it out in Swedish. You have no dictionaries or codebooks to help you.You just have to figure it out. That is what his job has been like, but harder.This has taken several years and the help of researchers from many differentdisciplines. In Berger’s system, the damaged CNS neurons would be replaced withsilicon neurons that mimic their biologic function. The silicon neurons wouldreceive electrical activity as inputs from, and send it as outputs to, regionsof the brain with which the damaged region previously was connected. Thisprosthesis would replace the computational function of the damaged brain andrestore the transmission of that computational result to other regions of thenervous system.26 So far his tests on rats and monkeys “worked extremely well,”but tests on humans are still a few years away.4> > Caveats and ConcernsFuturists like Ray Kurzweil envision this technology being able to do far more.He foresees enhancement chips: chips that will increase your intelligence, chipsthat will increase your memory, chips that can have information downloaded intothem. Learn French, Japanese, Farsi? No problem, just download it. Do advancedcalculus? Download it. Increase your memory? Sure, just get anotherfive-terabyte chip implanted. Mary Fisher Polito, a friend who occasionallysuffers from a “senior moment” memory lapse, says, “I hope they hurry up withthose chips. I could use some more RAM now.” Kurzweil also envisions the worldbeing populated with such intelligent people that the major problems facing uswill be easily solved. “Greenhouse gases? Oh, I know how to fix that. Famine?Who’s hungry? There have been no reports of hunger for the last fifty years.War? That is so retro.” But then, Chris von Ruedon, one of my students, pointsout, “It’s often the most intelligent people who cause such problems.” Othersare concerned about such scenarios as: “Honey, I know that we were saving thismoney for a vacation, but maybe we should get the twins neural chips instead. Itis hard for them in school when so many of the other kids have them and are somuch smarter. I know you wanted them to stay natural, but they just can’t keepup, and their friends think they are odd.” Artifact-driven evolution!But in a sense, the story of human evolution has been artifact-driven ever sincethe first stone ax was chipped, and perhaps even earlier. Merlin Donald, acognitive neuroscientist at Case Western Reserve University, thinks thatalthough humanity is greatly concerned about changes in the physical ecology ofthe external world, we should be paying more attention to what has been going oninside our heads. Information storage and transfer went from the internallystored memory and experience of a single individual to being internally storedand transferred by many individuals as storytellers, to external memory storageon papyrus, then to books and libraries, then to computers and the Internet. Hethinks that there have been equally massive changes in the cognitive ecology,due to the advent of these huge banks of external memory storage, and we are notdone yet. He predicts that this runaway proliferation of information willprobably set our future direction as a species.27 Perhaps that next step in thisevolution of information storage may be to store it internally, again with thehelp of implanted silicon: just another tool.Or not. The idea that we are messin’ with our innards is disturbing to many. Andjust what would we do with expanded intelligence? Are we going to use it forsolving problems, or will it just allow us to have longer Christmas card listsand bigger social groups? If we spend 90 percent of our time talking about eachother, will we solve the world problems or just have more stories to tell? Butthere is another major problem with Kurzweil’s scenario: No one knows what it isthat the brain is doing that makes a person intelligent. Just having a lot ofinformation available doesn’t necessarily make a person more intelligent. Andbeing intelligent does not necessarily make a person wise. As David Gelernter, acomputer scientist at Yale, wonders, “What are people well informed about in theinformation age?…Video games?” He isn’t impressed; in fact, he seems to thinkpeople are less informed.28 So what about intelligence? What were those smartrobots all about?> > SMART ROBOTS?My desires in a personal robot are rather mundane. I just want it to do all thethings I don’t want to do. I want it to get the mail, hand me any personalhandwritten letters and invitations, and take everything else and deal with it.I want it to check my e-mail and throw out all the spam and pay my bills. I wantit to keep track of finances, fund my retirement, do the taxes, and hand me anet profit at the end of the year. I want it to clean the house (including thewindows), and it might as well do all the car maintenance. Ditto with weeding,trapping gophers, and…well, it might as well do the cooking, too, except when Iwant to. I would like my robot to look like Sophia Loren in Divorce ItalianStyle, not R2D2. I may have trouble with that one, because my wife wants JohnnyDepp doing all the chores. Maybe R2D2 isn’t such a bad idea. As I said, my needsare mundane. I can do all these things, but I’d rather spend my time doingsomething else. For disabled persons who cannot do any of these things, apersonalized robot would allow far more autonomy than they have.The thing is, this may not be so far off, or at least some of it, and that wouldbe great. But maybe, if we aren’t careful, the smart robot won’t be grumblingabout cat hair as it is cleaning the floor. It may be discussing quantum physicsor, worse yet, its “feelings.” And if it is intelligent, will it still do allour chores? Just like you and your kids, won’t it figure out a way not to dothem? That would mean it would have desires. Once it has feelings, will we feelguilty about making it do all the scut work, and start cleaning up before therobot comes in, and apologizing for the mess? Once it is conscious, will we haveto go to court to get it decommissioned so we can get the latest model? Will arobot have rights? As Clynes and Kline pointed out in their original descriptionof a cyborg in space, “The purpose of the Cyborg…is to provide an organizationalsystem in which [such] robot-like problems are taken care of automatically andunconsciously, leaving man free to explore, create, think, and feel.”7 Withoutmy actually merging physically with silicon, without actually becoming a cyborg,a separate silicon assistant could just as easily give me more time to explore,create, think, and feel (and, I might add, gain weight). So I am going to becareful which model I order. I do not want a robot with emotions. I don’t wantto feel guilty that my robot is vacuuming while I am out on the deck in the suneating a now mandatory calorie-reduced lunch and thinking deep thoughts, likemaybe I should get up and weed.How close are we to my idea of a personal robot? If you haven’t been keeping upwith what is going on in the world of robotics, you will be amazed. There arecurrently robots doing plenty of the jobs that are repetitive and/or requireprecision, from automobile assembly to surgery. Currently the domain of robotsis the three Ds—dull, dangerous, or dirty. The dirty category includes toxicwaste cleanups. Surgery is none of those three; it is just being done on amicroscopic level. Currently Pack Bots that weigh eighteen kilograms are beingused as emergency and military robots. They can negotiate rough terrain andobstacles such as rocks, logs, rubble, and debris; they can survive a drop oftwo meters onto a concrete surface and land upright; and they can function inwater up to two meters deep. They can perform search and rescue, and disarmbombs. They are being used to detect roadside bombs and reconnoiter caves.However, these robots do not look like your dream of a handsomesearch-and-rescue guy (like my brother-in-law) as you are lying at the base ofsome cliff you foolishly tried to climb. They look like something your kid wouldbuild with an erector set.There are also unmanned robotic aircraft. A robot has driven most of the wayacross the United States. Driving in an urban setting is still the mostdifficult test and has yet to be perfected. The Urban Challenge, a sixty-milecompetition for autonomous vehicles sponsored by the Defense Advanced ResearchProjects Agency (DARPA), was held in November 2007. Vehicles had to be able tonegotiate city streets, intersections, and the parking lot, including finding aspot, parking legally, and then leaving the lot without a fender bender, whileavoiding shopping carts and other random objects. This is not remote control.These are cars controlled by software, driving on their own. It may not be toolong before computer programs will drive all cars. We will recline, read thepaper, munch a doughnut (I’ll take jelly), and drink a latte on the way to work.But so far, on the home-cleaning front, all we have is a floor cleaner andvacuum cleaner that looks like a CD player, and a lawn mower. But what theserobots have, and what my dream does not have, are wheels. No robot yet can movethrough the room like Sophia Loren or Johnny Depp. Half the neurons in the humanbrain are at work in the cerebellum. Part of their job is motivating, not in thesense of “come on, you can do it,” but in the sense of Chuck Berry andMaybelline in the Coupe de Ville motivatin’ up the hill—that is, timing andcoordinating muscles and skills.Developing a robot with animal-like motion is incredibly difficult and has yetto be accomplished, but engineers at Shadow Robot Company in England, underfounder Richard Greenhill, think they are getting close. Since 1987, they havebeen working to build a bipedal robot. Greenhill says, “The need foranthropomorphism in domestic robotics is classically illustrated by the problemof staircases. It is not feasible to alter houses or to remove the staircases.It is possible to design robots with stair-climbing attachments, but these areusually weak spots in the design. Providing a robot with the same locomotivestructures as a human will ensure that it can certainly operate in anyenvironment a human can operate in.”29 They are getting there, and along the waythey have developed many innovations, one of them being the Shadow Hand, astate-of-the-art robotic hand that can do twenty-four out of the twenty-fivemovements that a human hand can perform. It has forty “air muscles,” anotherinvention. The shadow hand has touch sensors on its fingertips and can pick up acoin. Many other laboratories are working on other aspects of theanthropomorphic robot. David Hanson, at the University of Texas, has made asubstance he has called Flubber, which is very much like human skin and allowslifelike facial expressions.* [Human_split_113.html#filepos1455521] So it ispossible to have a robotic Johnny Depp sitting in your living room, but he isn’tup to doing the tango yet.> > Japan Takes the LeadJapan is a hot spot for robotic research. They have a problem that they arehoping robots will help solve. Japan has the lowest birth rate in the world, and21 percent of the population is over sixty-five, the highest proportion ofelderly in any nation. The population actually started declining in 2005, whenbirths were exceeded by deaths. The government discourages immigration; thepopulation is over 99 percent pure Japanese. Any economist will tell you this isa problem. There aren’t enough young people to do all the work; shortages arealready being felt in many areas, including nursing. So if the Japanese don’twant to increase immigration, then they are going to have to figure out a way totake care of their elders. They are looking to robotics.At Waseda University, researchers have been working on creating facialexpressions and upper-body movements that correlate with the emotions of fear,anger, surprise, joy, disgust, sadness, and, because it is Japan, a Zen-likeneutral state. Their robot has been created with sensors: It can hear, smell,see, and touch. They are studying how senses translate into emotions and want todevelop a mathematical model for this.30 Their robot will then react to externalstimuli with humanlike emotions. It is also programmed with instinctual drivesand needs. Its needs are driven by appetite (energy consumption), the need forsecurity (if it senses it is in a dangerous situation, it will withdraw), andthe need for exploration in a new environment. (I will not order one of these.)The Waseda engineers have also made a talking bot that has lungs, vocal cords,articulators, a tongue, lips, a jaw, a nasal cavity, and a soft palate. It canreproduce a humanlike voice with a pitch control mechanism. They have even builta robot that plays the flute.At Meiji University, designers have set their sights on making a consciousrobot. It may be that from this intersection of robotic technology, computertechnology, and the desire to make humanlike robots, a greater understanding ofhuman brain processing will emerge. Building a robot to act and think as a humandoes means testing the theories of brain processing with software and seeing ifthe result corresponds to what the human brain is actually doing. As CynthiaBreazeal, who leads a group at MIT, points out, “While many researchers haveproposed models of specific components of social referencing, these models andtheories are rarely integrated with one another into a coherent, testableinstance of the full behavior. A computational implementation allows researchersto bring together these disparate models into a functioning whole.”31 TohruSuzuki, Keita Inaba, and Junichi Takeno lament that no one yet has presented agood integrated model to explain consciousness. Yak yak yak, but how do youactually hook it all up? So instead of shrugging their shoulders, they wentabout making their own model and then built a robot using this design.Actually they built two, and you will see why. They believe that consciousnessarises from the consistency of cognition and behavior.32 What does that remindyou of? How about mirror neurons? Those same neurons that are firing when youcogitate a behavior and when you perform it. You can’t get more consistent thanthat. Next they turn to a theory by Merlin Donald—that the ability to imitatemotor action is the foundation of communication, language, the human level ofconsciousness, and human culture in general. This is known as mimesis theory.Donald has been thinking a lot about the origins of language, and he just doesnot see it happening without fine motor skills, and in particular, the abilityto self-program motor skills. After all, language and gesture require therefined movements of muscles. And while other animal species have geneticallydetermined rigid types of behavior, human language is not rigid but flexible.Thus the motor skills required for language must also be flexible. There justhad to be voluntary, flexible control of muscles before language could develop.He sees this flexibility coming from one of the fundamentals of motorskill—procedural learning. To vary or refine a motor movement, one needs torehearse the action, observe its consequences, remember them, and then alterwhat needs to be altered. Donald calls this a rehearsal loop, something we areall familiar with. He notes that other animals do not do this. They do notinitiate and rehearse actions entirely on their own for the purpose of refiningtheir skill.33 Your dog is not practicing shaking hands all day while you are atthe office. Merlin thinks that this rehearsal-loop ability is uniquely human andforms the basis for all human culture, including language.So, Suzuki and pals drew up a plan for a robot that had consistency of behaviorand cognition. They built two, to see if they would show imitative behavior. Onerobot was programmed to make some specific movements, and the second robotcopied them! Imitative behavior implies that the robot can distinguish itselffrom another robot: It is self-aware. They believe that this is the first stepon the road to consciousness. Unlike other designs but like many models of humanconsciousness, this one had feedback loops for both internal and externalinformation. External information (somatic sensation) feedback is needed for arobot to imitate and learn. The external result of action must come back to theinterior in order to modify it if need be: Action must be connected tocognition. Internal feedback loops are what connect the cognition to the action.However, these robots don’t look like what I’m pretty sure you are visualizing.They look like something that a mechanic would pull out from under the hood of aMercedes and charge an arm and a leg to replace.> > Meanwhile, Back at MITThe problem with robots is, they still mostly act like machines. CynthiaBreazeal at MIT sums it up: “Robots today interact with us either as otherobjects in the environment, or at best in a manner characteristic of sociallyimpaired people. They generally do not understand or interact with people aspeople. They are not aware of our goals and intentions.”34 She wants to give herrobots theory of mind! She wants her robot to understand her thoughts, needs,and desires. If one is building a robot to help the elderly, she continues,“Such a robot should be persuasive in ways that are sensitive to the person,such as helping to remind them when to take medication, without being annoyingor upsetting. It must understand what the person’s changing needs are and theurgency for satisfying them so that it can set appropriate priorities. It needsto understand when the person is distressed or in trouble so that it can gethelp.”Kismet, the second-generation Cog, is a sociable robot that was built in the labof Rodney Brooks, director of the MIT Computer Science and ArtificialIntelligence Laboratory, predominantly by Cynthia Breazeal when she was Brooks’sgraduate student. Part of what makes Kismet a sociable robot is that it haslarge eyes that look at what it is paying attention to. It is programmed to payattention to three types of things: moving things, things with saturated color,and things with skin color. It is programmed to look at skin color if it islonely, and bright colors if it is bored. If it is paying attention to somethingthat moves, it will follow the movement with its eyes. It has a set ofprogrammed internal drives that increase until they release certain behaviors.Thus if its lonely drive is high, it will look around until it finds a person.Then, since that drive is satisfied, another drive will kick in, perhapsboredom, which will increase, and it will start searching for a bright color;this makes it appear to be looking for something specific. It may then find atoy, giving an observer the impression that it was looking specifically for thetoy. It also has an auditory system that detects prosody in speech. With thismechanism it has a program that matches certain prosody with specific emotions.Thus it can detect certain emotions such as approval, prohibition, attentiongetting, and soothing—just like your dog. Incoming perceptions affect Kismet’s“mood” or emotional state, which is a combination of three variables: valence(positive or negative), arousal (how tired or stimulated it is), and novelty.Responding to various motion and prosody cues, Kismet will proceed amongdifferent emotional states, which are expressed through its eyes, eyebrows,lips, ears, and the prosody of its voice. Kismet is controlled by theinteraction of fifteen different computers running various operating systems—adistributed system with no central control. It does not understand what you sayto it, and it speaks only gibberish, though gibberish with the proper prosodyfor the situation. Because this robot simulates human emotions and reactions,many people relate to it on an emotional level and will speak to it as if itwere alive. Here we are back to anthropomorphism.Rodney Brooks wonders if simulated, hard-coded emotions in a robot are the sameas real emotions. He presents the argument that most people and artificialintelligence researchers are willing to say that computers with the rightsoftware and the right problem can reason about facts, can make decisions, andcan have goals; but although they may say that a computer may act as if, behaveas if, seem as if, or simulate that it is afraid, it is hard to find anyone whowill say that it is viscerally afraid. Brooks sees the body as a compilation ofbiomolecules that follow specific, well-defined physical laws. The end result isa machine that acts according to a set of specific rules. He thinks thatalthough our physiology and constituent materials may be vastly different, weare much like robots. We are not special or unique. He thinks that weoveranthropomorphize humans, “who are after all mere machines.”9 I’m not surethat, by definition, it is possible to overanthropomorphize humans. Perhaps itis better to say we underanthropomorphize machines or undermechanomorphizehumans.Breazeal’s group’s next attempt at developing TOM in a robot is Leonardo. Leolooks like a puckish cross between a Yorkshire terrier and a squirrel that istwo and a half feet tall.* [Human_split_114.html#filepos1455735] He can doeverything that Kismet can do and more. They wanted Leo to be able to identifyanother’s emotional state and why that person is experiencing it. They also wanthim (they refer to Leo as “he” and “him,” so I will, too) to know the emotionalcontent of an object to another person. They don’t want Leo tramping on theGucci shoes or throwing out your child’s latest painting that looks like trashto anyone but a parent. They also want people to find Leo easy to teach. Insteadof your having to read an instruction manual and learn a whole new form ofcommunication when you get your first robot, they want Leo to be able to learnas we do. You’ll just say, “Leo, water the tomatoes on Thursdays” and show himhow to do it, and that’s it. No small ambitions!They are banking on the neuroscience theory that humans are sociable, and welearn through using our social skills. So first, in order to be responsive in asocial way, Leonardo has to be able to figure out the emotional state of theperson with whom he is interacting. They approached designing Leo using evidencefrom neuroscience that “the ability to learn by watching others (and inparticular the ability to imitate) could be a crucial precursor to thedevelopment of appropriate social behavior—and ultimately the ability to reasonabout the thoughts, intents, beliefs, and desires of others.” This is the firststep on the road to TOM. The design was inspired by the work done on newborns’facial imitation and simulation ability by Andrew Metzoff and M. Keith Moore,whom we read about in chapter 5. They needed Leonardo to be able to do the fivethings that we talked about that a baby could do when it was hours old: 1. Locate and recognize the facial features of a demonstrator. 2. Find the correspondence between the perceived features and its own. 3. Identify a desired expression from this correspondence. 4. Move its features into the desired configuration. 5. Use the perceived configuration to judge its own success.35So they built an imitation mechanism into Leonardo. Like Kismet, he has visualinputs, but they do more. Leo can recognize facial expressions. Leo has acomputational system that allows him to imitate the expression he sees. He alsohas a built-in emotional system that is matched to facial expression. Once thissystem imitates a person’s expression, it takes on the emotion associated withit.The visual system also recognizes pointing gestures and uses spatial reasoningto associate the gesture with the object that is indicated. Leonardo also tracksthe head pose of another. Together these two abilities allow him to understandthe object of attention and share it. He makes and keeps eye contact.Like Kismet, he has an auditory system, and he can recognize prosody, pitch, andthe energy of vocalization to assign a positive or negative emotional value. Andhe will react emotionally to what he hears. But unlike Kismet, Leo can recognizesome words. His verbal tracking system matches words to their emotionalappraisal. For instance the word friend has a positive appraisal, and the wordbad has a negative one, and he will respond with the emotional expression thatmatches the words.Breazeal’s group also incorporated the neuroscience findings that memory isenhanced by body posture and affect.36 As Leo stores information in long-termmemory, the memory can be linked with affect. His ability to share attentionalso allows him to associate emotional messages of others with things in theworld. You smile as you look at the painting your kid did; Leo looks at it too,and he files it away in memory as a good thing—he doesn’t toss it with thetrash. Shared attention also provides a basis for learning.So we are reasonably close to a robot that is physically humanlike in appearanceand movement, one that can simulate emotions and is sociable. However, you’dbetter not be doing the rumba with your robot, because it most likely wouldbreak your foot if it accidentally trod on it (these puppies are notlightweight). You should also consider its energy requirements (there goes theelectric bill). But what about intelligence? Social intelligence is not all myrobot will need. It is going to have to outfox gophers, and it is going to haveto be pretty dang intelligent to outfox the gophers in my yard, which, I amsure, have the same genetic code as the Caddyshack survivors.Ray Kurzweil is not worried so much about the physical vehicle. It is theintelligence that interests him. He thinks that once computers are smart enough,that is, smarter than we are, they will be able to design their own vehicles.Others think that humanlike intelligence and all that contributes to it cannotexist without a human body: I think therefore my brain and my body am. AlunAnderson, editor in chief of New Scientist magazine, put it this way when askedwhat his most dangerous idea was: “Brains cannot become minds without bodies.”37No brain-in-a-box will ever have humanlike intelligence. We have seen howemotion and simulation affect our thinking, and, without those inputs, we wouldbe, well, a whole ’nother animal. And Jeff Hawkins, creator of the Palm Pilot,thinks since we don’t even know what intelligence is and what processes in thebrain produce it, we have a lot of work still to do before we can haveintelligent machines.38> > ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCEThe term artificial intelligence (AI) originated in 1956, when John McCarthyfrom Dartmouth College, Marvin Minsky from Harvard University, NathanielRochester of the IBM Corporation, and Claude Shannon from the Bell TelephoneLaboratories proposed that “a 2 month, 10 man study of artificial intelligencebe carried out during the summer of 1956 at Dartmouth College in Hanover, NewHampshire. The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that everyaspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be soprecisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. An attempt willbe made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions andconcepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improvethemselves. We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more ofthese problems if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it togetherfor a summer.”39Looking back at that statement made over half a century ago, it seems as if itwas a little optimistic. Today the American Association for ArtificialIntelligence defines AI as “the scientific understanding of the mechanismsunderlying thought and intelligent behavior and their embodiment in machines.”40However, despite all the computing power and effort that have gone into makingcomputers intelligent, they still can’t do what a three-year-old child can do:They can’t tell a cat from a dog. They can’t do what any surviving husband cando: They don’t understand the nuances of language. For instance, they don’t knowthat the question “Have the trash barrels been taken out?” actually means, “Takethe trash barrels out,” and that it also has a hidden implication: “If you don’ttake the trash out, then….” Use any search engine, and as you gaze at what popsup, you think, “Where did that come from? That is so not what I’m looking for.”Language translation programs are wacky. It is obvious the program has no clueas to the meaning of the words it is translating. Attempts are continually beingmade, but even with all the processing power, memory, and miniaturization,creating a machine with human intelligence is still a dream. Why?Artificial intelligence comes in two strengths: weak and strong. Weak AI is whatwe are used to when we think about computers. It refers to the use of softwarefor problem-solving or reasoning tasks. Weak AI does not include the full rangeof human cognitive abilities, but it may also have abilities that humans do nothave. Weak AI has slowly permeated our lives. AI programs are directing ourcell-phone calls, e-mails, and Web searches. They are used by banks to detectfraudulent transactions, by doctors to help diagnose and treat patients, and bylifeguards to scan beaches to spot swimmers in need of help. AI is responsiblefor the fact that we never encounter a real person when we make a call to anylarge organization or even many small ones, and for the voice recognition thatallows us to answer vocally rather than press a number. Weak AI beat the worldchampion chess player, and can actually pick stocks better than most analysts.But Jeff Hawkins points out that Deep Blue, IBM’s computer that beat the worldchess champion, Garry Kasparov, at chess in 1997, didn’t win by being smarterthan a human. It won because it was millions of times faster than a human: Itcould evaluate two hundred million positions per second. “Deep Blue had no senseof the history of the game, and didn’t know anything about its opponent. Itplayed chess yet didn’t understand chess, in the same way that a calculatorperforms arithmetic but doesn’t understand mathematics.”38Strong AI is what flips many people out. Strong AI is a term coined by JohnSearle, a philosopher at the University of California, Berkeley. The definitionpresupposes, although he does not, that it is possible for machines tocomprehend and to become self-aware. “According to strong AI, the computer isnot merely a tool in the study of the mind; rather, the appropriately programmedcomputer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programscan be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states.”41 Searlemaintains that all conscious states are caused by lower level brain processes,42thus consciousness is an emergent phenomenon, a physical property—the sum of theinput from the entire body. Consciousness does not just arise from banter backand forth in the brain. Consciousness is not the result of computation. You haveto have a body, and the physiology of the body and its input, to create a mindthat thinks and has the intelligence of the human mind.> > IS A CONSCIOUS MACHINE POSSIBLE?The logic behind believing a machine can be conscious is the same logic that isbehind creating AI. Because human thought processes are the result of electricalactivity, if you can simulate that same electrical activity in a machine, thenthe result will be a machine with humanlike intelligence and consciousness. Andjust as with AI, there are some who think that this does not mean that themachine’s thought processes need necessarily be the same as a human’s to produceconsciousness. Then there are those who agree with Hawkins and think that itmust have the same processes, and that to have those, it has to be hooked up thesame way. And there are those who are on the fence.The quest for artificial intelligence was not originally based onreverse-engineering the brain, because in 1956, when AI was a glimmer of anidea, very little was known about how the brain works. Those early engineers hadto wing it when they began to design AI. They initially came up with their ownsolutions for creating the various components of artificial intelligence, andsome of these methods have actually supplied clues to how parts of the brainwork. Some of these approaches are based on mathematical rules, such as Bayesianlogic, which determines the likeliness of a future event based on similar eventsin the past, or Markov models, which evaluate the chance that a specificsequence of events will happen and are used in some voice-recognition software.The engineers built “neural nets,” set up to run in parallel and looselysimulating neurons and their connections; they actually learn responses that arenot preprogrammed in. These systems have also been used in voice-recognitionsoftware. They are also used to detect fraud in credit-card charges, and in faceand handwriting recognition. Some are based on inference—the old “if this, thenthat” logic. There are programs that search through large numbers ofpossibilities, such as the chess program Deep Blue. Some are planning programsthat start with general facts about the world, rules about cause and effect,facts germane to particular situations, and the intended goal—just like thedirection finder in your car that plans routes and tells you how to get to theclosest Chinese takeout.But the human brain is different in many ways from a computer. In his book TheSingularity Is Near, Kurzweil enumerates the differences.> [images/00002.jpg] The brain’s circuits are slower but more massively> parallel.

Heignores the fact that the brain is hooked up to a biological body. So far, AIprograms are good only at the thing they are specifically designed for. Theydon’t generalize and aren’t flexible.2 Deep Blue, with all its connections,massive memory, and power, does not know that it better take the trash out…orelse.Although human-level intelligence has not been achieved, computers surpass someof our abilities. They are better at symbolic algebra and calculus, schedulingcomplex tasks or sequences of events, laying out circuits for fabrication, andmany other mathematically involved processes.9 They are not good at that elusivequality, common sense. They can’t critique a play. As I said before, they arenot good at translating from one language to another, nor at nuances within alanguage. Oddly, it is many of the things that a four-year-old can do, ratherthan what a physicist or a mathematician can do, that are the hang-ups.No computer yet has passed the Turing Test, proposed in 1950 by Alan Turing,43the father of computer science, to answer the question, Can machines think? Inthe Turing Test, a human judge engages in a natural language conversation withtwo other parties, one a human and the other a machine, both trying to appearhuman. If the judge cannot reliably tell which is which, then the machine haspassed the test. The conversation is usually limited to written text, so thatvoice is not a prejudicial factor. Many researchers have a problem with theTuring Test. They do not think that it will indicate whether a machine isintelligent. Behavior isn’t a test of intelligence. A computer may be able toact as if it were intelligent, but that does not mean it is.> > PALM PILOT TO THE RESCUEJeff Hawkins thinks he knows why no truly intelligent machines have been made.It is not because computers just need to be more powerful and have more memory,as some researchers think. He thinks everyone working on artificial intelligencehas been barking up the wrong tree. They have been working under the wrongpremise38 and should be paying more attention to how the human brain works.Although John McCarthy and most other AI researchers think that “AI does nothave to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable,”44 Hawkinsthinks this notion is what has led AI research astray. And he isn’t so happywith neuroscientists, either. Slogging through neuroscience literature to answerthe question of just how the brain works, he found that although mounds ofresearch have been done, and tons of data accumulated, no one yet has put it alltogether and come up with a theory to explain how humans think. He was tired ofthe failed attempts at AI and concluded that if we don’t know how humans think,then we can’t create a machine that can think like a human. He also concludedthat if no one else was going to come up with a theory, he’d just have to do ithimself. So he founded the Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience and setabout the business. Jeff is no slouch. Or maybe he is. He leaned back, put hisfeet up on the desk, cogitated, and came up with the memory-prediction theory,38which presents a large-scale framework of the processes in the human brain. Hehopes other computer scientists will take it out for a spin, tweak it, and seeif it works.Hawkins was fascinated when he read a paper written in 1978 by the distinguishedneuroscientist Vernon Mountcastle, who had made the observation that theneocortex is remarkably similar throughout, and therefore all regions of thecortex must be performing the same job. Why the end result of that job isdifferent for different areas—that is, vision is the result of processing in thevisual cortex, hearing in the auditory cortex, etc.—is not because they havedifferent processing methods. It is because the input signals are different, andbecause of how the different regions are connected to each other.One piece of evidence that backs up this conclusion was the demonstration of theplasticity (an ability to change its wiring) of the cortex done by Mriganka Surat MIT. To see what effect the input to a cortical area had on its structure andfunction, he rewired visual input in newborn ferrets so that it went to theauditory cortex instead of the visual cortex.45, 46 Would a ferret be able touse another portion of the somatosensory cortex, such as the auditory cortextissue, to see? It turns out that the input has a big effect. The ferrets couldsee to some extent. This means that they were seeing with the brain area thatnormally hears sounds. The new “visual cortical tissue” isn’t wired exactly asit would have been in the normal visual cortex, leading Sur and his colleaguesto conclude that input activity can remodel the cortical networks, but it is notthe only determinant of cortical structure; there are probably intrinsic cues(genetically determined) that also provide a scaffold of connectivity.47 Thatmeans specific areas of the cortex have evolved to process certain types ofinformation and have been wired in a certain way to better accommodate it, butif need be, because the actual mode of processing is the same in all theneurons, any part of the cortex can process it.This idea that the brain uses the same mechanism to process all information madea lot of sense to Hawkins. It united all the capabilities of the brain into onetidy package. The brain didn’t have to reinvent the wheel every time it expandedits abilities: It has one solution for thousands of problems. If the brain usesa single processing method, then a computer could too, if he could figure outwhat that method was.Hawkins is a self-declared neocortical chauvinist. He looks on the neocortex asthe seat of our intelligence: It was the last to develop and is larger andbetter connected than any other mammal’s. However, he fully keeps in mind thatall the input that goes into it has been processed by lower-level brain regions:those regions that are evolutionarily older, which we share with other animals.So using his big neocortex, Hawkins came up with his memory-prediction theory,and we are going to check it out.All the inputs into the neocortex come from our senses, just as in all animals.One surprising thing is that no matter what sense we are talking about, theinput into the brain is in the same format: neural signals that are partlyelectrical and partly chemical. It is the pattern of these signals thatdetermines what sense you experience; it doesn’t matter where they come from.This can be illustrated by the phenomenon of sensory substitution.Paul Bach y Rita, who was a physician and neuroscientist at the University ofWisconsin, became interested in the plasticity of the brain after caring for hisfather, who was recovering from a stroke. He understood that the brain isplastic and that it is the brain that sees, not the eyes. He wondered if hecould restore vision to a blind person by providing the correct electricalsignal but through a different input pathway, that is, not through the eyes,which were no longer functioning and providing input. He created a device thatdisplays visual patterns on the tongue, so that a blind person would be able towear the device and “see” via sensations on the tongue.48 Visual images from asmall TV camera worn on the forehead are delivered to arrays of stimulators in adisc worn on the tongue. (He tried several parts of the body, including theabdomen, back, thigh, forehead, and fingertip, and found the tongue to be thebest.) The images from the camera are translated into a neural code, which thestimulator implements by creating specific pressure patterns on the tongue. Thenerve impulses created by the pressure patterns are sent to the brain via theintact sensory pathway from the tongue, and the brain quickly learns tointerpret these impulses as vision. Wacky, huh? With this system, a congenitallyblind person was able to perform assembly and inspection tasks on an electronicassembly line of miniature diodes, and totally blind persons can catch a ballrolling across a table and identify faces.Hawkins says that an important aspect of all this sensory information is that nomatter what sense’s input is being processed, it is arriving in the form ofspatial and temporal patterns. When we hear something, it is not only the timingbetween sounds that is important, the temporal pattern, but also the actualspatial position of the receptor cells in the cochlea is important. With vision,obviously there are spatial patterns, but what we don’t realize is that withevery image that we perceive, the eye is actually jumping three times a secondto fixate on different points. These movements are known as saccades. Althoughwhat we perceive is a stable picture, it actually is not. The visual systemautomatically deals with these continuously changing images and you perceivethem as stable. Touch is also spatial, but Hawkins points out that just onesingle sensation is not enough to identify an object; it has to be touched inmore than one spot, which adds a temporal aspect.So with this understanding of the input, we go to the six-layered dish towel,the neocortex. Following Mountcastle’s theory, Hawkins assumes that each cell ina particular layer of the dish towel performs the same type of process. So allthe neurons in layer I do the same process, then the result is sent to layer IIand the layer II cells all do their thing, and so on. However, the informationis not just being sent up through the levels, it is also sent laterally to otherregions and back down. Each one of those pyramidal neurons may have up to tenthousand synapses. Talk about an information superhighway!The neocortex is also divided into regions that process different information.Now we come to the notion of hierarchy. The brain treats information in ahierarchical manner. This is not a physical hierarchy such that higher-levelcortical areas sit on top of each other, but a hierarchy of informationprocessing, a hierarchy of connectivity. The region at the bottom of thehierarchy is the biggest and receives tons of sensory information, each neuron aspecialist in a bit of minutiae. For instance, at the bottom of the hierarchyfor visual processing is an area known as V1. Each neuron in V1 specializes in atiny patch of an image, like a pixel in a camera, but not only that, it has aspecific job within the pixel. It fires only with a specific input pattern, suchas a 45-degree line slanted down to the left. It makes no difference whether youare looking at a dog or a Pontiac; if there is a 45-degree downward slant to theleft, this neuron will fire. Area V2, the next region up the hierarchy, startsputting the information from V1 together. Then it sends what it has piecedtogether to V4. V4 does its thing, and then the information goes to an areacalled IT. IT specializes in entire objects. So if all the incoming info matchesa face pattern, then a group of neurons specific for face patterns in IT startfiring away as long as they are receiving their info from below. “I’m getting aface code, still there, still there, ahh…, OK, it’s gone. I’m out.”But don’t get the idea that this is a one-way system. Just as much informationis going down the hierarchy as coming up. Why?Computer scientists have been modeling intelligence as if it were the result ofcomputations—a one-way process. They think of the brain as if it, too, were acomputer doing tons of computations. They attribute human intelligence to ourmassively parallel connections, all running at the same time and spitting out ananswer. They reason that once computers can match the amount of parallelconnections in the brain, they will have the equivalent of human intelligence.But Hawkins points out a fallacy in this reasoning, which he calls thehundred-step rule. He gives this example: When a human is shown a picture andasked to press a button if a cat is in the picture, it takes about a half secondor less. This task is either very difficult or impossible for a computer to do.We already know that neurons are much slower than a computer, and in that halfsecond, information entering the brain can traverse only a chain of one hundredneurons. You can come up with the answer with only one hundred steps. A digitalcomputer would take billions of steps to come up with the answer. So how do wedo it?And here is the crux of Hawkins’s hypothesis: “The brain doesn’t ‘compute’ theanswers to problems; it retrieves the answers from memory. In essence, theanswers were stored in memory a long time ago. It only takes a few steps toretrieve something from memory. Slow neurons are not only fast enough [to] dothis, but they constitute the memory themselves. The entire cortex is a memorysystem. It isn’t a computer at all.”38 And this memory system differs fromcomputer memory in four ways: 1. The neocortex stores sequences of patterns. 2. It recalls patterns autoassociatively, which means it can recall a complete pattern when given only a partial one. You see a head above a wall and know that there is a body connected to it. 3. It stores patterns in invariant form. It can handle variations in a pattern automatically: When you look at your friend from different angles and different distances, although the visual input is completely different, you still recognize her. A computer would not. Each change in input does not cause you to recalculate whom you are looking at. 4. The neocortex stores memory in a hierarchy.Hawkins proposes that the brain uses its stored memory to make predictionsconstantly. When you enter your house, your brain is making predictions frompast experience: where the door is, where the door handle is, how heavy the doorit is, where the light switch is, which furniture is where, etc. When somethingis brought to your attention, it is because the prediction failed. Your wifepainted the back door pink without telling you of her intentions, so you noticeit. (“What the heck…?”) It didn’t match the predicted pattern. (In fact, itdidn’t match anything.) Thrill seeker that he is, Hawkins proposes thatprediction “is the primary function of the neocortex, and the foundation ofintelligence.”38 That means that prediction is going on all the time ineverything that you do, because all those neocortical cells process in the samemanner. Hawkins states, “The human brain is more intelligent than that of otheranimals because it can make predictions about more abstract kinds of patternsand longer temporal pattern sequences.”38Rita Rudner, in a comedy routine occasioned by her wedding anniversary, says youhave to be very careful about what household activities you perform during thefirst two weeks of marriage, because those are going to be the ones that youwill be stuck doing for the duration. You don’t want to set up a predictablepattern that you will regret! Hawkins sees intelligence as measuring just howwell you remember and predict patterns, whether they are patterns of words,numbers, social situations, or physical objects. So this is what is going onwhen cortical areas are sending information down the cortical hierarchy:> For many years most scientists ignored these feedback connections. If your> understanding of the brain focused on how the cortex took input, processed it,> and then acted on it, you didn’t need feedback. All you needed were feed> forward connections leading from sensory to motor sections of the cortex. But> when you begin to realize that the cortex’s core function is to make> predictions, then you have to put feedback into the model: the brain has to> send information flowing back toward the region that first receives the> inputs. Prediction requires a comparison between what is happening and what> you expect to happen. What is actually happening flows up, and what you expect> to happen flows down.38So back to the visual processing of the face that we started with: IT is firingaway about identifying a face pattern, sending this info forward to the frontallobes, but also back down the hierarchy. “I’m getting a face code, still there,still there, ahh…, OK, it’s gone, I’m out.” But V4 had already put most of theinfo together, and while it sent it up to IT, it also yelled back down to V2, “Ibetcha that’s a face. I got it almost pieced together, and the last ninety-fiveout of one hundred times the pieces were like this, it was a face, so I betchathat’s what we got now, too!” And V2 is yelling, “I knew it! It seemed sofamiliar. I was so guessing the same damn thing. I told V1 as soon as it startedsending me stuff. Like I am so hot!” This is a simplified rendition, but you getthe idea.The neocortex of mammals got tacked onto the lower-functioning reptilian-typebrain (with some modifications). That brain, however, was no small potatoes. Itcould and still can do a lot. Crocodiles can see, hear, touch, run, swim,maintain all their homeostatic mechanisms, catch prey, have sex, and get a shoecompany named after them. We can do most of these same things without ourneocortex, although Michael Jordan needed his to get shoes named after him.Having this addition made mammals smarter, and Hawkins says it is because itadded memory. Memory allowed an animal to predict the future, by being able torecall previous sensory and behavioral information. The neurons receive theirinput and recognize it from the day before. “Gee, we got similar signalsyesterday, and it turned out to be a delicious thing to eat. Well, hey, all ourinput is just like yesterday. Let’s predict that it is the same thing asyesterday, a delicious tidbit. Let’s eat it.”Memory and prediction allow a mammal to take the rigid behaviors that theevolutionarily old brain structures developed and use them more intelligently.Your dog predicts that if he sits, puts his paw on your lap, and cocks his head,you will pet him, just as you did all those other times. He did not have toinvent any new movement. Even without his neocortex, he could sit, lift his paw,and cock his head, but now he can remember the past and predict the future.However, animals depend on the environment to access their memory. Your dog seesyou, and that gives him his cue. There is no evidence that he is out on the lawnruminating about what to do to get petted. Merlin Donald maintains that humanshave the unique ability to autocue. We can voluntarily recall specific memoryitems independent of the environment.49 Hawkins thinks that human intelligenceis unique because the neocortex of humans is bigger, which allows us to learnmore complex models of the world and make more complex predictions. “We seedeeper analogy, more structure on structure, than other mammals.” We also havelanguage, which he sees as fitting nicely into the memory prediction framework.After all, language is pure analogy and is just patterns set in a hierarchicalstructure (semantics and syntax), which is the meat and potatoes of what hisframework recognizes. And, just as Merlin Donald suggested, language neededmotor coordination.Humans have also taken their motor behavior to the extreme. Hawkins makes thepoint that our ability to execute complex movements is due to the fact that ourneocortex has taken over most of our motor functions. Knock out the motor cortexof a rat, and you may not notice any change, but knock it out in a human, andthe result is paralysis. Our motor cortex is much more connected to our musclesthan that of any other species. This is why Michael Jordan needed his neocortexto become the king of basketball. Hawkins thinks our movements are the result ofpredictions, and predictions cause the motor command to move: “Instead of justmaking predictions based on the behavior of the old brain, the human neocortexdirects behavior to satisfy its predictions.”38Hawkins doesn’t really foresee my getting a personal robot. He thinks that inorder for a robot to act like a human or interact in humanlike ways, it willneed all the same sensory and emotional input, and it will need to have hadhuman experiences. To behave as a human, you need to experience life as a humanbiological entity. This would be extremely difficult to program, and he doesn’tsee the point. He projects that such robots would be more expensive and highermaintenance than a real human and couldn’t relate to a human on the level ofshared experience. He thinks that we can build an intelligent machine by givingit senses (not necessarily the same as we have; it could have infrared vision,for instance) so that it can learn from observation of the world (rather thanhaving everything programmed in), and a heck of a lot of memory, but it isn’tgoing to look like Sophia or Johnny.Hawkins is not worried that an intelligent machine is going to be malevolent orwant to take over the world or be concerned that it is a slave to its humanoppressor. These fears are based on a false analogy: confusing intelligence with“thinking like a human,” which as we have seen, is often dominated by theemotional drives of the evolutionarily old part of our brain. An intelligentmachine would not have the drives and desires of a human. There is a differencebetween the neocortical intelligence measured by the predictive ability of ahierarchical memory, and what happens to that when input from the rest of thebrain is added. He doubts that we will be able to download our minds onto a chipand pop it into a robot, as Ray Kurzweil predicts will be possible. He foreseesno way that the trillions of unique connections in the nervous system can becopied and duplicated, and then popped into a robotic body just like yours. Allthose years of sensory input from the exact dimensions of a specific body havehoned the predictions of each brain. Pop it into a different body, and thepredictions will be off. Michael Jordan’s timing would be totally off in DannyDeVito’s body, and vice versa.> > The Blue Brain ProjectHenry Markram, director of the Brain and Mind Institute at the ÉcolePolytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), in Switzerland, is a big advocate ofthe view that in order to understand how the brain works, the biology of thebrain is of the utmost importance. He agrees with Hawkins about the problems inmodeling artificial intelligence: “‘The main problem in computationalneuroscience is that theoreticians [who] do not have a profound knowledge ofneuroscience build models of the brain.’ Current models ‘may capture someelements of biological realism, but are generally far from biological.’ What thefield needs, he says, is ‘computational neuroscientists [who are] willing towork closely with the neuroscientists to follow faithfully and learn from thebiology.’”50 Markram is a detail man. He’s no theoretical windbag. He mucksaround at the ion channel, neurotransmitter, dendritic, synaptic level and workshis way up.Markram and his institute, collaborating with IBM and their Blue Gene/Lsupercomputer, have now taken on the task of reverse engineering the mammalianbrain. This project has been dubbed the Blue Brain Project, and it rivals thehuman genome project in its complexity. To begin with, they are creating a 3-Dreplica of a rat brain with the intention of eventually being able to create oneof a human brain. “The aims of this ambitious initiative are to simulate thebrains of mammals with a high degree of biological accuracy and, ultimately, tostudy the steps involved in the emergence of biological intelligence.”3 It isnot an attempt to create a brain or artificial intelligence, but an attempt torepresent the biological system. From this, insights about intelligence and evenconsciousness may be drawn.Markram makes the fundamental point that there are “quantum leaps in the‘quality’ of intelligence between different levels of an organism.” Thus theintelligence of an atom is less than that of a DNA molecule, which has lessintelligence than the protein it codes, which alone is nothing compared tocombinations of proteins that produce different cell types. These different celltypes combine to produce different brain areas, which contain and processdifferent types of input. You get the picture. The brain as a whole makes thenext quantum leap in the quality of intelligence beyond its physical structures,the separate brain areas, and the neurons. The question is whether it is theinteraction between the neurons, that whole thing about being well connected,that is driving that last qualitative leap. So this 3-D model is no flim-flamreplica that has ever been done before. In fact, it never could have been donebefore. It requires the huge computational power of the Blue Gene computer, thebiggest, baddest, fastest computer in the world.They are building the replica specific neuron by specific neuron, because everyneuron is anatomically and electrically unique, with unique dendriticconnections. The project is founded on an immense amount of research that hasbeen going on for the last hundred years in neuroanatomy, beginning with theunraveling of the microstructure of the neocortical column, and in physiology,beginning with the model of ionic currents and the idea that dendritic branchesof neurons affect their processing. The first goal of the project has beenaccomplished. That was to construct a single neocortical column (NCC) of atwo-week-old rat. In preparation for this project, the researchers at EPFL, overthe last ten years, have been performing paired recordings of the morphology andphysiology of thousands of individual neurons and their synaptic connections inthe somatosensory cortex of two-week-old rats. The replica NCC, the “bluecolumn,”* [Human_split_115.html#filepos1455981] is made up of ten thousandneocortical neurons within the dimensions of an NCC, which is about half amillimeter in diameter and one and a half millimeters tall.3At the end of 2006, the first column was completed; the model included thirtymillion synapses in precise 3-D locations! The next step is to comparesimulation results of the model with experimental data from the rat brain. Areaswhere more info is needed can then be identified, and more research will be doneto fill in these gaps. This is not a one-shot deal. The circuit will have to berebuilt over and over again every time a section gets tweaked by new data, andthe replica of the real biological circuit will become progressively moreaccurate.> > What’s the Point of Building This Model?Markram has a whole laundry list of information that will be gleaned from thesemodels. Just as Breazeal thinks her robots will be useful for verifyingneuroscientific theories, so Markram thinks of the blue column the same way:“Detailed, biologically accurate brain simulations offer the opportunity toanswer some fundamental questions about the brain that cannot be addressed withany current experimental or theoretical approaches.”3 First, he sees it as a wayto gather all the random puzzle pieces of information that have been learnedabout cortical columns, and put them all together in one place. Currentexperimental methods allow only glimpses at small parts of the structure. Thiswould allow the puzzle to be completed. You jigsaw fans know how satisfying thatcan be.Markram has hopes the continual tweaking of the details of the model will allowus to understand the fine control of ion channels, receptors, neurons, andsynaptic pathways. He hopes to answer questions about the exact computationalfunction of each element, and their contribution to emergent behavior. He alsoforesees insight into the mystery of how the emergent properties of thesecircuits—such as memory storage and retrieval, and intelligence—come about. Adetailed model will also aid in disease diagnosis and treatment. Besidesidentifying weak points in circuits that can cause dysfunction and targetingthem for treatment, simulations of neurological or psychiatric disease couldalso be used to check hypotheses about their origins, to design tests todiagnose them, and to find treatments. It will also provide circuit designs thatcan be used for silicon chips. Not too shabby!> > CHANGING YOUR GENESGregory Stock, director of the Program on Medicine, Technology and Society atUCLA, doesn’t think the fields of technology and robotics are going to changewhat it means to be human. He thinks being a fyborg is where it is at. Machineswill stay machines, bodies will remain carbon. The idea of hopping up onto theoperating table for a bit of neurosurgery when he feels just fine doesn’t muchappeal to him, and he doesn’t think it will appeal to many people, especiallywhen everything you would gain could be had by wearing an external device. Iknow neurosurgery is not on the top of my to-do list. Why risk it, when youcould strap on a watch-like device or clip something on your belt? Why give up agood eye when you could slip on a pair of glasses for night vision? Stock thinksour world is going to be rocked by the fields of genetics and geneticengineering—tinkering with DNA, man directing his own evolution. These changesaren’t going to be the result of some mad scientist cooking up ideas aboutmodifying the human race to his specifications; they are going to creep inslowly as the result of work done to treat genetic diseases and to avoid passingthem on to our children. They are also going to come from the realization thatmuch of our temperament is due to our genes ( just like the domesticatedSiberian foxes we talked about) and that those genes will be modifiable. “Wehave already used technology to transform the world around us. The canyons ofglass, concrete, and stainless steel in any major city are not the stompingground of our Pleistocene ancestors. Now our technology is becoming so potentand so precise that we are turning it back on our own selves. And before we’redone, we are likely to transform our own biology as much as we have alreadychanged the world around us.”51> > Biology-Based Aids—The Ways to Change Your DNAYou can change your biology by taking medications, or you can change theinstruction manual that coded how to build your body. That manual is DNA. Thereare two ways to tinker with DNA: somatic gene therapy and germ-line therapy.Somatic gene therapy is tinkering with the DNA a person already has innonreproductive cells; it affects only the current individual. Germ-line therapyis tinkering with the DNA in sperm, egg, or an embryo, so that every cell in thefuture adult organism has the new DNA, including the reproductive cells. Thatmeans the change is passed on to future generations.Stanley Cohen of Stanford University and Herbert Boyer, then at the Universityof California, San Francisco, worked only thirty miles apart, but they met inHawaii. They attended a conference on bacterial plasmids in 1972. A plasmid is aDNA molecule, usually in the shape of a ring. It is separate from thechromosomal DNA but is also able to replicate. It is usually found floatingaround in bacterial cells. One reason they are important is that these strandsof DNA can carry information that makes bacteria resistant to antibiotics. Cohenhad been working on ways to isolate specific genes in plasmids and clone themindividually by putting them in Escherichia coli bacteria and letting themreplicate. Boyer had discovered an enzyme that cut DNA strands at specific DNAsequences, leaving “cohesive ends” that could stick to other pieces of DNA.Shop-talking over lunch, they wondered if Boyer’s enzyme would cut Cohen’splasmid DNA into specific, rather than random, segments, then bind thosesegments to new plasmids. They decided to collaborate, and in a matter of monthssucceeded in splicing a piece of foreign DNA into a plasmid.52 The plasmid actedas a vehicle to carry this new DNA, which then inserted new genetic informationinto a bacterium. When the bacterium reproduced, it copied the foreign DNA intoits offspring. This created a bacterium that was a natural factory, cranking outthe new DNA strands. Boyer and Cohen, now considered to be the fathers ofbiotechnology, understood that they had invented a quick and easy way to makebiological chemicals. Boyer went on to cofound the first biotech company,Genentech. Today, people all around the world enjoy the benefits of Boyer andCohen’s “cellular factories.” Genetically engineered bacteria produce humangrowth hormone, synthetic insulin, factor VIII for hemophilia, somatostatin foracromegaly, and the clot-dissolving agent called tissue plasminogen activator.This line of research suggested that perhaps custom DNA could be added to humancells, but the problem was how to get it into the cell.The goal of somatic therapy is to replace a defective gene that is causing adisease or dysfunction by the insertion of a good gene into an individual’scells. In somatic gene therapy, the recipient’s genome is changed, but not inevery cell in the body, and the change is not passed along to the nextgeneration. This has not been an easy assignment. Although there has been a lotof research done in this area, and a lot of money spent, the successes have beenfew and far between.First of all, there is the problem of just exactly how one inserts genes into acell. Researchers finally figured out that they should use the experts in cellinvasion and replication: viruses. Unlike bacteria, viruses cannot replicate ontheir own. In reality, a virus is merely a vehicle for DNA or RNA. It consistsof DNA or RNA surrounded by a protective coat of protein: That’s it. They arethe quintessential houseguests from hell.Viruses actually sneak their way inside a host cell and then use the cell’sreplication apparatus to make copies of their own DNA. However, if you couldmake that DNA a good copy of a defective gene, and direct it to cells that havea defective copy, well then, you can see the possibilities of a virus acting asthe agent of somatic gene therapy: Take the virus’s DNA out, add the DNA thatyou want, and turn it loose.To begin with, research has concentrated on diseases that are caused by only asingle defective gene in accessible cells, such as blood or lung cells, ratherthan diseases caused by a host of defects that work in concert with each other.But of course, nothing is as easy as first envisioned. The protein coats of theviruses are foreign to the body, and sometimes they have triggered hostreactions that have caused rejection, a problem that recently may have beensolved by researchers in Italy.53 Because of the problems with rejection,different DNA vehicles are being explored. Inserting strands of DNA on achromosome is also tricky, because it matters where it is put. If spliced nextto a DNA sequence that regulates the expression of the sequences next to it, itcan result in unexpected consequences, such as tumors.54 Moreover, most geneticdiseases, such as diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease, and variouscancers, arise from a host of genes, not just one. Also, the effects of thetherapy may not last. The cells that have been modified may not be long-lived,so that the therapy has to be repeated.Gene therapy has had a few successes, including the treatment of severe combinedimmunodeficiency disease (also known as bubble-boy disease)55, 56, 57 andX-linked chronic granulomatous disease,58 which is another type of immunedeficiency. As I am writing this, the BBC reports that a team at London’sMoorfields Eye Hospital made the first attempt to treat blindness caused by afaulty gene called RPE65 using gene therapy.59 Whether this worked or not willnot be known for months. The trouble is, somatic therapy is really a quick fix.The people who have been treated still carry the mutant gene and can pass it onto their offspring. This is the problem that prompts research in germ-linetherapy.In germ-line gene therapy, the embryo’s DNA is changed, including the DNA in itsreproductive cells. When it comes time for it to reproduce, its egg or spermcells carry the new DNA, and the changes are passed on to their offspring. Thedisease-producing gene or genes are eliminated for good in a particularindividual’s genome. This idea could not even have been considered until 1978,when the first test-tube baby was born. In vitro fertilization involvesharvesting egg cells from the woman’s ovary, and mixing them on a petri dishwith sperm. The resultant embryo is then accessible to manipulation. Verycontroversial at the time, in vitro fertilization (IVF) is now casualcocktail-party talk. That is not to say the process is enjoyable. It isdifficult and both physically and emotionally arduous. Notwithstanding thedifficulties, many infertile couples benefit from the technology, to the extentthat 1 percent of the babies born in the United States are the result of invitro fertilization.Not all in vitro fertilization is done for infertile couples. Some is done forcouples who have had a child with a genetic disease, such as cystic fibrosis. Itis also done when one or both of the prospective parents know they carry a copyof a defective gene. Embryos conceived in vitro, when they reach the eight-cellstage, can now be screened with the genetic tests that are currently available.Up until 2006, there were just a small handful of diseases that could be testedfor. However, a new procedure known as preimplantation genetic haplotyping(PGH),60 developed at Guy’s Hospital in London, has changed that. It is nowpossible to take a single cell from the early embryo, extract the DNA, replicateit, and then use it for DNA fingerprinting. This not only increases the numberof genetic defects that can be detected in preimplantation embryos, now ranginginto the thousands, but also increases the number of usable embryos and theirsurvival rate. Before this test was available, if the concern was for X-linkeddisease, none of the male embryos could be tested, so they were eliminated. Nowthey too can be screened. Humans are the only animal that can tinker with theirchromosomes (and those of other species, too) and guide their geneticreproduction.The future implications of PGH are huge. There is a Web site calledBetterHumans.com. The first page of comments about PGH seems to cover theterritory pretty well:“It’s pretty important considering how much it will affect the lifelonghappiness of an individual and how well they can contribute to the world.”“It is wonderful that this is not illegal yet. Do you not love incrementalism?”“But once again, we need to define disease. I consider the average lifespan tobe a disease.”“Perhaps it will be possible to extrapolate the genetic tendency for longerlife, in which case we can engineer longer lifespans into the populace.”“When we can clearly say that a given DNA pattern has an unacceptably highpropensity for a specific disease—it would be unethical to propagate it.”“You’re right, it’s not a simple process to weed out disease from sociallydesirable traits…. Diversity will be important to maintain.”“However, for public policy: an international ethical board should decide whichgenetic options lead to medical disorders.”Those less enthusiastic may agree with Josephine Quintavalle, member of thepro-life activist organization Comment on Reproductive Ethics, who said: “I amhorrified to think of these people sitting in judgment on these embryos andsaying who should live and who should die.”61Even before the advent of this type of testing, an earlier version that allowedscreening for only a handful of diseases caused different countries to take verydifferent approaches to legislating and regulating its use, giving rise to thephenomenon of reproductive tourism—the one vacation from which you won’t appearso well rested on your return. Obviously this even more exhaustive testing willbring more ethical questions with it.62Currently if a couple does such testing, they may be concerned only with geneticdisease that causes a lifelong affliction or an early death. But the truth is,no embryo is going to be perfect. It may not have the genes coding forchildhood-onset diseases like cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy, but supposeit had genes that indicated a high probability of developing diabetes in middleage, or heart disease, or Alzheimer’s disease? Are you going to toss it, startall over again, and try for a better one? How about depression? And this iswhere the future of germ-line therapy and all of those headache-provokingethical questions may come into play: Don’t toss ’em, change ’em!Changing the DNA of an embryo changes the DNA in all its future cells, from thebrain to the eyeballs to the reproductive organs. It changes the DNA in thefuture egg and sperm cells also. That means the altered DNA is passed on to allthe future offspring, which would therefore be “genetically modified organisms.”In a sense, every organism is genetically modified just by the recombining ofgenes. Humans have already been guiding their evolution more than they realize,from raising crops to modern medicine. Although modern medicine has found waysto treat such things as infectious disease, diabetes, and asthma, allowingpeople to live longer, it has also allowed some people—who normally would nothave lived to reproductive age—to reproduce and pass those genes on.Inadvertently, this affects evolution, increasing the prevalence of genes codingfor these diseases. However, the term genetically modified organisms has come tomean tinkering with DNA by man for the purpose of selecting for or againstspecific traits. This has been done in plants and on laboratory animals, but notwith humans.Today, in 2007, when you have a child without IVF, you really can’t be heldresponsible for his or her DNA: You get what you get. That is, unless you knowthat you carry a defective gene that can produce a disease, and you choose toreproduce anyway. It is a matter of opinion how ethical that is. Now that thehuman genome has been sequenced, and you will soon be able to get your ownpersonal sequencing done for a few bucks, this laissez-faire attitude about thefuture DNA of your offspring may not be acceptable.I can imagine the courtroom scene: > “Mr. Smith, I see here that you had your gene sequencing done in February of> 2010. Is that correct?”> > “Ah, yeah, I thought it would be cool to get it done.”> > “I also see that you received a printout of the results and an explanation of> what they meant.”> > “Well, yeah, they gave me that paper.”> > “Yes, but you signed this paper that said you understood you carried a gene> that could cause any of your offspring to have….”> > “Yeah, I guess so.”> > “And you went ahead and had a child without first doing PGH? You did nothing> to prevent this disease in your child?”> > “Well, you know, we just got caught up in the moment, and, well, it just> happened.”> > “Did you tell your partner you knew you were the carrier of these defective> genes?”> > “Ah, well, I kinda forgot about it.”> > “You kinda forgot about it? When we have the technology to prevent this sort> of thing?” But then there is the other side of the coin. Your future teenager may hold youresponsible for all that she doesn’t like about herself. “Gee Dad, couldn’t youhave been a little more original? Like, everyone has curly blond hair and blueeyes. And maybe you could have made me more athletic. I mean, I can’t even run amarathon without training.”No one is tinkering with the human germ line just yet. Too much is still unknownabout the properties of various genes and how they affect and control eachother. It may turn out that it will be too complicated to mess with. Genes thatcontrol the expression of certain traits may be so linked with the expressionand control of other genes that they may not be able to be isolated. Certaintraits may be the result of a constellation of genes that can’t be alteredwithout affecting many other traits. Parents are going to be reluctant tointerfere with their children’s genes, and well they should be. Europeans andpeople in Marin County don’t even want them altering the genes of theirvegetables. That is why a different idea is being pursued: an artificialchromosome.> > Artificial ChromosomesThe first version of an artificial human chromosome was made by a group at CaseWestern Reserve University in 1997.63 It was to be used to help illuminate thestructure and function of human chromosomes, and possibly to avoid some of theproblems of viral and nonviral gene therapy. You will recall that we havetwenty-three pairs of chromosomes. The idea is to add an “empty” (and, we hope,inert) chromosome, which can be modified. The artificial chromosome is put intothe embryo, and then whatever you order up will be tacked on to it. Some of whatis tacked on may have on-and-off switches that would be under the individual’scontrol when they are older. For instance, there could be a gene forcancer-fighting cells that wouldn’t express itself except in the presence of aparticular chemical. That chemical would be given as an injection. A personfinds out he has cancer, he gets the injection that turns on the gene thatproduces the cancer-fighting cells, and voilà, the body cleans up the messwithout any further ado. Another type of injection would turn the gene off. Andif better sequences are discovered, then when it comes time for your offspringto reproduce, they can replace whatever is on the artificial chromosome with thenewer, better version. Some of the genes would have to be able to suppress theexpression of genes on the original chromosomes, if they control the trait youwant modified.Of course, this all presupposes IVF. Will humans control their reproduction tothis extent? Our current genetically coded sexual urges lead to a great deal ofwilly-nilly reproduction. In the United States, abortion eliminates half ofthese unplanned pregnancies. However, if this urge is suppressed by selectingfor a population of people that plan everything, will we survive as a species?How much will all this cost? Will only wealthy countries, or the wealthy in eachcountry, be able to afford it? Does that matter?You may find this disconcerting and think we should be pulling in the reins abit, but you also need to remember what is driving our behavior. Our genes areprogrammed to reproduce. Besides urging reproductive behavior, they also make ussafeguard our children to ensure that they survive to reproduce themselves.Stock predicts that this safeguarding will include routine PGH, that those whocan afford to will no longer reproduce that old-fashioned, rather haphazard way,but will resort to IVF and embryo selection.And of course, next up after disease prevention will be embryo modification orenhancement. As more is learned about how our brain activity is controlled byour personal genetic code, how mental illness results from specific sequences ofDNA, and how different temperaments are coded for, the temptation to tinker mayprove irresistible. At first, the motivation will be to prevent disease, butwhile you’re at it…, how about…? Stock quotes a comment made by James Watson,codiscoverer of DNA’s double-helix structure, at a conference on human germ-lineengineering in 1998: “No one really has the guts to say it, but if we could makebetter human beings by knowing how to add genes, why shouldn’t we?”64Modification and enhancement will be a fuzzy zone, depending on your point ofview. “If you are really stupid, I would call that a disease,” Watson said on aBritish documentary. “The lower 10 percent who really have difficulty, even inelementary school, what’s the cause of it? A lot of people would like to say,‘Well, poverty, things like that.’ It probably isn’t. So I’d like to get rid ofthat, to help the lower 10 percent.”65 Both Watson and Stock realize we aregoing to have to understand that many of the psychological differences betweenpeople (and the similarities) have biological roots.These technologies will originally be explored for the treatment and preventionof disease, for developing genetically tailored drugs, and for geneticcounseling. But obviously they will have applicability to modification andenhancement of the human genome. “OK, I got a couple of embryos here. What didyou guys want added? Oh, yeah, here is your order form. I see you have checkedtall, symmetrical, blue eyes, happy, male. Hmm, are you sure about that?Everyone is ordering tall males. Jeez, there goes horse racing. Oh, you want theathletic package, and the anticancer, antiaging, antidiabetes, anti–heartdisease package. That’s standard. Comes with the chromosome now.”So humans may soon be taking a hands-on approach to their own evolution.However, tincture of time will not be an aspect of this type of change.Selected-for traits will not be honed by hundreds of thousands of years ofphysiological, emotional, social, and environmental interactions. Our trackrecord for preserving finely balanced interactions has not been so stellar.Think rabbits in Australia: Introduced in 1859 for hunting on an estate, withinten years the twenty-four original rabbits had multiplied to such an extent thattwo million could be shot or trapped annually with no noticeable effect on thepopulation. Rabbits have contributed to the demise of one-eighth of allmammalian species in Australia, and an unknown number of plant species. Theyalso munch on plants to the point where plant loss has contributed to massiveamounts of erosion. All that to be able to bag a few on the manor. You don’teven want to know how much money has been spent dealing with those rabbits.Apparently the rabbit lesson wasn’t enough. Another supposedly good idea gonebad was the one hundred cane toads that were introduced to Australia in 1935because they were thought to be good for controlling beetles in the sugarcanefields of Central and South America. Now there are more than one hundred millionacross New South Wales and the Northern Territory. They are not popular. Loudand ugly with a voracious appetite and ducts full of poisonous bile, they eatmore than beetles. They have had a disastrous effect on indigenous fauna inAustralia. Or consider the Indian mongoose, brought to Hawaii to control therats that had come to Hawaii as stowaways. Not only did they not control therats, they killed all the land fowl. Or how about the recent introduction ofzebra mussels, native to the Black, Caspian, and Azov seas, which were dumpedinto the Great Lakes in the mid-1980s in the ballast water of vessels fromEurope. They are now one of the most injurious invasive species to affect theUnited States, and have been found as far as Louisiana and Washington. Zebramussels have altered the ecosystems of the Great Lakes by reducingphytoplankton, the foundation of the local food chain. They have other negativeeconomic impacts, causing damage to the hulls of ships, docks, and otherstructures and clogging water-intake pipes and irrigation ditches. Need I go on?And these finely balanced systems were visible ones.What will come of all this genetics research? Exuberant technological scenarioshave us becoming so intelligent that we will be capable of solving the entireworld’s problems, eradicating disease, and living for hundreds of years. Are thethings that we consider problems really problems, or are they solutions forlarger problems that we haven’t considered? If a deer had the capacity toenumerate some of the problems it faces, we might hear, “I feel anxious all thetime, I always think there is a puma watching me. I can’t get a restful night’ssleep. If I just could get those damn pumas to become vegans, half my problemswould be solved.” We have seen what happens when the puma populations wane:forests become overpopulated with deer, which wreak havoc on the vegetation,leading to erosion…on and on. Problems for the individual may be solutions inthe big picture. Would animal-rights activists want to tinker with the genomesof carnivores to change them into herbivores? If they think it is wrong for ahuman to kill and eat a deer, what about a puma?Genetic enhancement will certainly involve tweaking personality traits. Thosethat may be considered undesirable, if possessed by no one, may unwittinglycause havoc. Richard Wrangham thinks pride has caused many of society’sproblems. But perhaps pride is what motivates us to do a job well. Perhapsshaving the capacity for pride out of the genome would result in people notcaring about the quality of their work and hearing the word “whatever” evenmore, if that is possible. Anxiety is often listed as another undesirable. Maybethe world would be better off without the anxious, but maybe not. Perhaps theanxious are the canaries of the world. So who is going to define what isdesirable and not? Will it be well-meaning parents, who think that a perfectlydesigned child will live a perfect life? Will the result be the same game ofRussian roulette that we already have?> > CONCLUSIONBeing human is interesting, that’s for sure, and it seems that it is gettingmore so. In a mad frenzy of utilizing our uniquely human abilities, such as ourarching and opposing thumbs, which allow us finely tuned movements, and ourabilities to question, reason, and explain imperceptible causes and effects,using language, abstract thinking, imagination, auto-cuing, planning,reciprocity, combinatorial mathematics, and so on, science is beginning to modelwhat is going on in that brain of ours and in the brains of other species. Wehave come across a few more uniquely human abilities as we looked at researcherstrying to create smart robots. One is Merlin’s rehearsal loop, and another ishis suggestion that humans are the only animals that can autocue. We alsolearned that each species has unique somatosensory and motor specialties thatgive each its unique way of perceiving, and moving in, the world.Some of the motivation for this research is pure curiosity, which is not auniquely human characteristic; some is from a desire to help relieve sufferingfrom injury or disease, driven by empathy and compassion, which arguably isuniquely human; and some is done to improve the human condition in general, agoal that definitely is uniquely human. Some of the research is driven bydesires that we share with all other animals, to reproduce healthy and fitoffspring. It remains to be seen whether our desires will drive us to manipulateour chromosomes to the point where we will no longer be Homo sapiens, whether wewill be trading up to silicon. Maybe we will be referred to in the future asHomo buttinski."},{"pageContent":"AFTERWORD [Human_split_003.html#filepos5714]> > This is my simple religion.

Iwrote many of the leading thinkers of America and asked them, since they madedecisions every day about worldly matters, what was their theory about thenature of man? This was done in preparation for my book The Social Brain. It wasa fascinating exercise and proved productive. So why not try it again, this timewith family and friends of both sexes and all ages?Naturally, I thought I might actually start the book with these suggestions andeither verify them or shoot holes in them. Most people told me they would thinkabout it and get back to me. I filed away the few responses I received. Ihaven’t looked at them again until now, wondering how they matched up with thevarious ideas and facts I had come across.It seems, even though the responses were few, I received a rather good crosssection. Although they weren’t all written in the same lingo, in one way oranother, several of our unique abilities were identified. Leave it to atherapist to identify the moral emotions of guilt and shame. A teacher suggestedthat humans are the only animal to actively teach their young. An accountantmentioned mathematical abilities, and a five-year-told me, “Animals don’t havebirthday parties for themselves, you have to give them one.” A teenager, freshout of high school, said other animals don’t starve themselves by dieting, don’taccessorize, and don’t have tummy tucks. Other unique abilities mentioned werethat humans could voluntarily recall an enormous amount of stored information,could play and write music, had language and religion, believed in an afterlife,played team sports, and were disgusted by feces.There were also the people who weren’t altogether impressed with humans. Somesaid that humans were not unique. One response from the obstetrics clinic was,“I think at the core humans are no different from animals. We all have thebestial urges of expanding our hunting range, controlling resources, andspreading our DNA. The need to ask the question separates us, but the reality ofour behavior is not so very different from our animal counterparts.” Or from anornithologist after a hard day: “Humans are self-centered egotists who takeadvantage of other humans, other animals, and the lands they inhabit for whatthey think suits them and without considering how their actions affect otherliving things—plant and animal.” Of course this describes all the animals thatshe loves, too. A hawk is not concerned about the mouse’s family when it swoopsin for lunch. A beaver is not concerned about the effects of the dam it isbuilding on the creek.I was also given some suggestions that sounded promising but then later provedto be a bit off. An anthropologist suggested that humans were the only animalwith incest taboos. As we saw, there is some of this going on with chimpanzees.That surprised me, too. A marine biologist suggested that humans were the onlyanimals that can change natural selection. I didn’t discuss something known asniche-construction theory, which suggests that animals actually do cause changesto their niche that affect natural selection. However, humans are the onlyanimals consciously tinkering with their DNA via technology. Along these lines,another observation was that humans have been able to separate sex fromreproduction through technology.Obviously, people were looking at the question from their own perspectives, thejobs they did, and their personal interests. I guess I should have quizzed achef, because no one mentioned cooking. It was interesting that no one broughtup the basic question concerning whether animals understood that otherindividuals had thoughts, beliefs, and desires, or thought about their ownthoughts. No one wondered if other animals’ consciousness was different from ourown, which is indicative of how strongly we humans anthropomorphize, lavishingtheory of mind on other animals. Also, no one mentioned that humans alonethought abstractly, had imagination, or thought about, reasoned about, andexplained imperceptible forces, causes, and effects. Nor did anyone suggest thatwe are the only animal that could separate pretense from reality, usecontingently true information, time-travel in our imaginations, or manifestepisodic memory. And no one realized that we are the only animal that can delaygratification by inhibiting our impulses over time. It was not surprising thatno one mentioned we were the only animal that frequency matched. Irritatinglyenough, however, not one person in my family mentioned the left-braininterpreter. What is up with that?On the evolutionary tree, we humans are sitting at the tip of our lonely branch.The chimps have their own branch with the bonobos sprouting off it, and a commonancestor links us. We have the same roots as all living organisms. That is whythose who don’t see much difference between humans and animals have a strongfooting. All those similarities are there. Our cellular processes depend uponthe same biology, and we are subject to the same properties of physics andchemistry. We are all carbon-based creatures. Yet every species is unique, andwe are too. Every species has answered the problem of survival with a differentsolution, filling a different niche.One other comment that I received was that humans don’t have a built-in defensemechanism, like fangs or claws. We do pack a punch with our fists, but we alsohave, as Inspector Poirot likes to point out, the little gray cells. We Homosapiens entered a cognitive niche. We have done all too well without the fangsand claws. Without the changes to our physical structure, we could not havedeveloped the abilities that we have. We needed to have free hands and fullyopposable thumbs and a larynx and all the other changes to our body before wecould acquire many of our unique abilities. Yet there were more than just thephysical changes.As we have seen, we do have physically big brains, but that is not the wholestory. The Neanderthals had a bigger brain than we but did not develop the sameadvanced artifacts as the upstart Homo sapiens. Will we ever know what happenedand how the change came about? This question haunts paleontologists such as IanTattersall. He just wants to know: unrequited curiosity. Many try to define ouruniqueness in terms of quantity versus quality. Are we on a continuum, as Darwinthought, or was there some big leap? By studying our closest living relatives,the chimps, we have learned that our brains are both quantitatively andqualitatively different. We have a bigger brain, and some of the parts aredifferent. But I think the crucial difference is that we aren’t hooked up thesame. Everything has been tweaked and interconnected. Feedback loops have beenformed that allow rumination and inhibition and may be the basis for ourself-awareness and consciousness. The corpus callosum has allowed more punch percubic inch of brain, eliminating redundancy and allowing the two hemispheres tospecialize and increase efficiency. Specialization appears to have run rampant,creating various modular pathways. Our mirror-neuron systems seem to be intoeverything, providing us with imitative abilities that may be the basis of oursocial abilities, our learning, our empathy, and perhaps our language. And thestory of those connections is continuing to unfold.Humans are actually just getting a toehold on understanding their abilities.Whether we have the brain capacity to assimilate all the information that isbeing collected is questionable. Maybe those people who see humans as onlyslightly different from the rest of the animals are right. Just like otheranimals, we are constrained by our biology. We may not have the capacity to beany better than their worst appraisal. But the ability to wish or imagine thatwe can be better is notable. No other species aspires to be more than it is.Perhaps we can be. Sure, we may be only slightly different, but then, some iceis only one degree colder than liquid water. Ice and water are both constrainedby their chemical composition, but they are very different because of a phaseshift. My brother closed his list of differences by saying, “Humans will sitbehind a computer and try to figure out the meaning of life. Animals live life.The question is: Who is better off, the human or the animal?”That’s enough! I am going out to tend to my vineyard. My pinot grapes will soonbe producing a fine wine. Am I ever glad I am not a chimp!"},{"pageContent":"NOTES [Human_split_003.html#filepos5980]> > Chapter 1: ARE HUMAN BRAINS UNIQUE?1. Preuss, T.M. (2001).

Each sugar has one of four types ofbases attached to it: adenine (abbreviated A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), andthymine (T). These bases then attach to each other (A with T, C with G) and holdthe helix together. It is the sequence of these bases that carries the geneticcode."},{"pageContent":"† These include the genes named ASPM, microcephalin, CDK5RAP2, CENPJ, sonichedgehog, APAF1, and CASP3."},{"pageContent":"‡ This is a fascinating gene story. Pakistan built the Mangla Dam in the 1960son the Jhelum River to generate power and store water for irrigation. The lakethat was created behind the dam flooded the valley, and 20,000 families losttheir homes and fertile farms in the region of Mirpur in Kashmir. Many of thesefamilies moved to Yorkshire, England, where there was a shortage of skilledtextile workers. Many years later, C. Geoffrey Woods, a physician and clinicalgeneticist from St James’ University Hospital in Leeds, England, noticed that hewas seeing several Pakistani families with children who had primarymicrocephaly. He began to study the DNA of the children with the affliction andtheir unaffected relatives, which led to the discovery of these two genes. TheMangla Dam was a controversial project at the time, and is once again. ThePakistani government is currently trying to increase the size of the dam,displacing another 44,000–100,000 people. A short review of the detective workthat went into the discovery of these two genes can be found in: A. Kumar, M.Markandaya, and S. C.

If a gene is recessive, in order for itto cause a visible or detectable characteristic, there must be a copy of it fromboth the mother and father. If there is only one copy, say from the mother, thenthe dominant gene from the father would determine the visible characteristic.Both parents have to be carriers of a recessive trait in order for a child tomanifest it.

Basal forebrain neurons that use acetylcholine astheir neurotransmitter chemical at the synapse (cholinergic neurons) areinvolved in attention and memory. Inhibiting these chemicals is one of themechanisms that causes sleep.
