I therefore, my dearest Brethren, greet you most heartily, and am glad of this Opportunity to rejoice with you, inasmuch as it hath pleased the Almighty, One, Eternal, Unalterable God, to send out his Light, and his _Truth, and his vivifying Spirit, whereby the Brotherhood begins to revive again in this our Isle, and Princes seek to be of this sacred Society, which has been from the Beginning, and always shall be ; the Gates of Hell shall never prevail against it, but it shall continue while the Sun and Moon endureth, and till the general Con- summation of all Things ; for since God, my dearest Brethren, is of us, who can be against us? This being so, I shall speak to you a few Words on this im- portant Subject ; and perhaps I am the first that ever spoke to you after this Manner .

Both the words of the Book Barasith, that are in our English Bible translated `create' and `make,' mean in reality (and are also used in that sense), to produce from one's self, to beget by copulation and imprea ation . Phallic columns also were common in every part of the orient, and obeliscs, standing stones, the stocks of trees, the round towers in Ireland, and even the cross, were representa- tions of the virile member . That the columns of the Temple should represent this organ, and one of them be designated bT a name signif ring erection, vigor, potency, was not at all sin- gular .

Knight says, \"when no prejudices of artificial decency existed, what more just and natural image could they find, by which to express their idea of the benefi- cent power of the Great Creator, than that organ which endowed them with the power of procreation, and made them partakers, not only of the felicity of the Deity, but of His great characteristic attribute-that of multiplying His own image, communicating His blessings and extending them to genera- tions yet unborn? \" Men who were taught by their religious guides or sacred books to believe that they were created in the image of the Deity, and that He had the form of a man, could not reason- ably be ashamed of an organ which he possessed, and to which they mystically imputed the generation of all things . It be- came the sacred symbol of the Divine Generative Power, by inevitable consequence . The book of Genesis (i . e . of the Begetting), tells us that the first man and woman were naked in Paradise, and felt no shame ; and the doctrine of the resur- rection of the body necessarily implies the possession and exposure without shame of the parts of generation in the next life . The Hebrew Kabalah deals largely with the ideas of pro- creation, and production thereby, between the various personi- fications of the Deity .

This, he thinks, accounts 'for the disproportionate size of the virilia afterwards attached to posts and pillars and to the figures of men,-sometimes, Herodotus says, almost as large as all the rest of the body . He says that the women carried about such images, causing the member to move, by a string, and adds, \" But why do these figures have the genital member of so disproportionate a size 9 and why do the women move that part only? A sacred reason is given for it ; but I am not at liberty to make it known .\" It is more probable that the genitalia, with the principal organ pleno vigore, became a symbol of the Divine generative potency, at least 4,000 years before Christ, and before the an- cestors of the Egyptians emigrated from the original home of the Aryan race ; and that the Bull was assigned as a name and figure to the constellation Taurus, on account of the size of his organ and his vigor in copulation, and because the wealth of these ancient herdsmen consisted in the multiplication of cattle, which are continually spoken of as wealth, in the Vedas . The human form was always assigned to the Deity, and creation has always been represented as effected by genera, ti on . It must have been the human Phallus that first became a sacred symbol ; and it does not appear that the organs of an animal, of the Bull, for example, were ever represented as attached to the human figure .

A Soul is as much a creature as these are . We can absolutely have no con- ception or idea at all, of what the Deity Is, nor even attribute Existence to It, in any sense which that word can have to us . Though the theory of Philo in regard to the Word contains many elements borrowed froth Platonism, it must be considered as aa natural and necessary development of his theological doe- trine . The principle that is supreme over this whole theory is, that Jehovah is retired in the impenetrable profundities of His essence . The rabalah declares that the Z ere God has ;,o name . Seeing the action and works of the Deity, we accept them as evidence, not only of His purposes and designs, as those of an Intelligence, but of His affections and sentiments as a moral being . We thus assign to Him in : ;enuitT, design, intention, and also beneficence and wisdom, with the meaning which those words have to us, when applied to our own nature . But always the question arises, how can the action and works of the Creator be evidence of the possession by Him of the faculties and sentiments, the passions and impulses, the calculation and contrivance and wisdom, with which He has endowed His crea- tures? Might we not as reasonably argue, that because we only see by means of our eves, and bear by means of our ears, the Deity can know what we do and say, only by means of the same senses We speak of the Force of Attraction, of the Force of Gravita- tion, of the Force of Magnetism, which directs the needle to the pole . We know the action, effects and results of those Forces, and can formulate the laws of their action ; but what are the Forces tlicms rrs ? Is a Force Matter, or Spirit? We must confess that every Force is \"retired in the impenetrable"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"I THE BOOK OF THE WORDS . \t 83 profundities of its essence .\" We know its manifestations only . Might we not with as much reason impute personality to \" a Force, as to the Deity ? How, then, explain the creation of the world? How explain the communication of God with created beings, otherwise than through a Mediator? The 'Cord is precisely this Mediator . Philo represents it as the outer (or uttered) Ford (?oyfx Tpuq â€¢o pvio :), the Image, the Countenance (Tpd6wzov) of God ; that is to sar, as the manifestation of the potencies concealed in the bosom of the Supreme Principle, Jehovah . Only he does not admit that the Word itself is the perfect and complete representation of the potencies of God . He considers it as only the Shadow of the Divine Light . As first manifestation of the Divine potencies, the 'Ford is the First-born, the first Arch- engel, of God : as the ideal type of human nature, he is the perfect man, the Celestial Adam . In this latter title is con- tained the principle of a great doctrine, to wit, the Incarnation- of the Word of God, in the human form . Upon this important point it will be well to quote Philo's own words \"Why did God say, `I have made man after the image of God,' as if He meant another God, and not Himself? In effect, it is not the Supreme God, Father of the tniverse, whom a mortal being can resemble, but a Second God, who is His Word . For the Intellectual type in the Sort of man must be an imprint of the Divine Word, because the God who is before the Word is superior to any intellectual nature ; wherefore nothing Mortal can resemble the God above the Word, who dwells apart in the most excellent essence .\" Another decisive passage is : \"I have heard a disciple of"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"THE BOOK OF THE WORDS Moses ( : ra'zps 7 ') pronounce this oracle : `Behold the man whose name is Orient (avcrrulrl)'- a strange appellation, if it was meant to speak of man composed of a soul and body . But if it was said of that incorporeal man who contains in . himself the Divine Idea, it will readily be admitted that this name Orient is that which is most appropriate .\" So, as Philo viewed it, the Ford, which, in respect of God, is the image of the divine Potencies, becomes, in respect of the creature, not the vague and universal type of created things, but specially the type of the intellectual nature, and conse- quently of human nature, in so far as it is intellectual Philo not only conceived the principle of this great doctrine, which was to be the basis of Christianity ; be also perceived its moral consequences . If the Divine Word is the type of Humanity, He is its Father, and all men are His sons, by imuiediate filiation . They are sons of the Word, before being children of God . The Word, with Philo, is at once the type of the Thought and the organ of the Power, of God the Creator ; He causes things to live, at the same time that He causes them to be : He constructs and animates the universe . God alone creates ; the Word only concurs in the creation . It is God alone who cre- ates ; but His creation is limited to an act of the will . He wills that the world be, and re-enters into His repose, leaving to the Word the care of accomplishing His will For the rest, the Divine will is a fruitful potency ; to will, for God, is to produce . It is evident that Philo did not confine himself to the doc- trine of Genesis, and that he conceived of the work of God as a true creation, as a real making (hr1oz ;) . This doctrine, more Oriental than Hebraic, was already contained, in the germ, in the Books of the Wisdom and Ecclesiasticus .

He does not merely arrange the Universe, as a simple Drmiourgos ; he products it, he esp1-es .~rs it, in its eutirety, not from nothing, but from Himself : in a word, he !gels it, and ma-es it within Hiniscdf -No test reveals, in the books of Philo, the least idea of creation ex nilsz7o .

The Egyptian God Osiris was termed 'the M ani fester,' and Har or Aruer (Horns, Oroeris), his son, succeeded to his attri- butes . Har (Harpocraies) is occasionally seen wearing round his neck a vase, the emblem of Thmei, the Goddess of Truth which, says Sir Gardner Wiildnson (Ancient Egyptians, iv . 407), probably refers to the amulet, said by Plutarch to have been \" worn by Isis at the time she brought him into the world, which was reported to mean, `speaking the Truth .\"' Senrick says, speaking of the principal Egyptian Court of Judicature (2 Ana Egypt . 42), \" a chain of gold and precious stones was worn, by the President, to which an image of Thmei, the Goddess of Truth, was attached, and he pronounced sen- tence by touching with this image the Plaintiff's or Defendant's pleadings .\" In a note to this, he sacs that the resemblance of this ornament to the Urimn and Thummim worn by the Jewish High Priest has been noticed by all writers on Jewish or Egyptian Antiquities ; but that the use was very different ; that one was an official chain, probably with a seal attached to it ; the other answered the purpose of an oracle . For this he refers to Ezod xrxix . 10 ; Lev . viii . 8, and Numb . zzvii . 2L Of these, the first two say nothing of the kind : and the verse in Numbers is, \"and he (Joshua) shall stand before Eleazar the Priest, who shall ask counsel (consult) for him, by the judg- ment of the Aurim in the presence of Yahcah ; at his com- mand they shall go forth, and at his command come in .\" Exod x=-iii . 30 reads, \" and thou shalt put in (or, 'on') the"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"1 50 \t THE BOOK OF TEE WORDS& breast-plate of judgment, the Anrim and Thmeim ; and they shall be on Aharun's breast when he comes in before Fahvah ; and Aharun shall wear the judgment of the Beni-Israel on his heart before Fahvah continually .\" In deciding what should be done by Feshna as Military Leader, the Priest, no doubt, pretended to speak what Fahvah prompted him .

Thmei or Thmai omits the vowel just as the Hebrew word does, and was probably pro- nounced Themei or Themai . The Hebrew word may as well be pronounced Thmeim as the Egyptian word Thmei . Temu or Tam was also an Egyptian Deity ; and, as we have seen, Thmeim or Thummim is the plural of C I -1 or tem or tam . The God Tam, `the Sun when he rises,' `the Great God creating himself,' `Lord of Life supplying the Gods,' is continually invoked and adored in the Book of the Dead . The Aurim and Thmeim were, most probably, pictures or images of Bores and Thmei or Tam, borrowed from the Egyp- tians . At all events, they were separate and distinct from the breast-plate, which could be worn without them . OLD FRENCH R11 U ALS . 1' . P . â€¢. W . â€¢.

The Kabalistic dogma was that of Hermes and of the old Indian Philosophy, that the All has proceeded from the Primal Unity, the Monad, Omnium Rerum Fous ac Origo . This One, the Very Deity, is in its t'eiy Self f beyond all cognition of the Intellect, which can form no idea of IT, nor in any- possible manner conceive of IT, or represent IT to itself . \"Nothing can be predicated of IT, sei least of all . \"Tone of our human faculties, moral or intellectual, can be assigned to IT, any more than our shape or senses can ."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"TM BOOS OF THE WORDS . \t 1 73 In fact we can hare no cognition of the Soul rmmy, of another human being . \"We can, by his words, know what some of his thoughts are, and hare cognition of some of the charac- teristics and qualities of himself, i . e ., of his spiritual and intellectual self ; but that knowledge is very shallow, partial and imperfect . The Soul expresses itself in a Thought . It is the whole Soul, as a unit, that thhinl-s, that forms the Thought, and utters it ; but no one Thought is the Soul, nor does any one Thought or any number of Thoughts express, manifest or reveal the whole Soul . It remains hidden from us . Thoughts are not made . We are not conscious of any operation of moulding, framing or fashioning, forging, as it were, our Thoughts . They seem to be produced within us, to be born there, in our Self, by means of some mode of genera- tion . The Deity, to create, the old philosophers thought, must hare proceeded in a manner analogous to that in which the human intellect proceeds, to express itself in Thought and iction . As no human Thought is the whole Soul, nor even the Soul think- ing, but what is generated in it and proceeds or flows from, or is produced by it ; so no Divine Thought is the whole of Deity, but that only which flows or emanates from him ; and set He, like the Human Soul, acts in and by the Thought, and what the Thought effects and produces, is effected and produced by Him . Every Divine Thought is finite . It is but a momentary flash or ray, from the TrAnite ocean of Light . The idea of what the Deity creates, is and exists in Him, before it is uttered outwardly in form . This idea is necessarily finite . Wherefore, to create, or to act so that what is created or acted shall be comprehensible to, or can be conceived of"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"174 \t THE BOOK OF THE WORDS . by a finite intellect, were it even that of an Archangel, the Deity must limit Itself, in order to be manifested or revealed . -Hence what the Kabalah terms the .Emanations or Sepla - roth ; the forth-floorings of the Deity, Its self-utterances . The First Sephirah is ),\"I_ Kether, or Katar, `Corona, the Crown,' which seems to me to be the Divine Tnfinite IT 'N, ex- erted and in its exertion finite and limited ; and so, also, when existing in the Deity unexerted . When directed to a definite purpose, it is itself necessarily limited . The Second Sephirah is Hakenuth or Chochmah, `Sapientia, Wisdom,' said to be male ; and the third is Bainah or Bayanah, female, which is rendered b y the Commentators on the Eabalah, ` Intelligent ia, Intelligence, Understanding .' Hakemah is the Divine Wisdom, immanent in the Deity, the Divine Power of Intellectual Generation of Thought and of Ideas which, uttered and expressed, become Universes . Bainah or Bayanah is the Divine Wisdom manifesting itself in men as the Human Intellect . From it proceeds Daath, which is not a Sephirah, but the human Intellection or the Thinking ; not the Thought produced, but the birth of it . The next Sephirothic Triad is h'hased or Gedulah, Mercy or Benignity ; Geburali, Severity or Justice, and Teplareth or Taparat, Harmony or Beauty . Infinite Justice and Infinite Mercy, Justice boundless and Mercy boundless, seem absolutely to exclude each other, and to be utterly incompatible one with the other . How can Mercy temper Justice, and the Justice remain infinite? How can Mercy exist at all, if Justice is infinite ? The Kabalists say that if the Infinite Justice of the Deity had existed without the Infinite Benignity, the Universe would"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"T3E BOOS OF THE WORDS . \t 1 75 have been impossible, because, if created, the Tnfinite Justice would have required its immediate annihilation as imperfect . But though these two attributes are opposites and con- traries, they are not in antagonism, nor hostile to each other . They are in equilibrium ; for above them is the Infinite Wis- dom, holding the beam of the Balance . The Seventh and Eighth Sephiroth are i ,>> and \t -Ye t- sach and Had, rendered by the Eabalists ` Victory' and ` Glory .' The result of the harmonious action guided and directed by Infinite Wisdom, is the overcoming of all obstacles, is Success, and a Creation precisely in conformity to the Divine Fill, approved of, also, by the Infinite Diane Wisdom ; and this Success is the Glory of Him whose worn the Universe is . The result of these is StacÂ°J .ity, - Z`, Yesicd, the -Ninth Sephrrah . . The work of Infinite Wisdom, acting in Harmony with Tnfimte Might, is capable of Endurance, and continues unaltered as a Whole, though its combinations change . And the last Seuhirah, .Malakoth, `Regnum, Royalty, Dominion,' is that perfect Sovereignty or the Deity over the 'Universe, b y which everything proceeds in exact accordance with and obedience to His will . -Nothing can happen, occur, be done or acted, contrary to His will, but it is in everything obeyed, our very free-will being one of His Instruments ."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"1 7 6 \t TEE BOOK OF TEE WORDS .
