Pi ke was raised in a Christian home and at tended an Episcopal ch urch. Pike passed the entrance examination at Harvard Co llege when he was 15 years old, but could not attend because he had no funds. After tr aveling as far west as Santa Fe, Pike settled in Arkansas, where he worked as editor of a newspaper before being adm itted to the bar. In Arkansas, he met Mary Ann Hamilton, and ma rried her on November 28, 1834. To this union were born 11 children. He was 41 years old w hen he applied for admi ssion in the Western Star Lodge No. 2 in Litt le Rock, Ark., in 1850. Active in the Grand Lodge of Arkansas, Pike took the 10 degrees of the York Rite from 1850 to 1853. He received the 29 degr ees of the Scottish Rite in March 1853 from Albert Gallatin Mackey in Charleston, S.C. The Scottish Rite had b een introduced in the Un ited States in 1783. Charleston was the lo cation of the first Su preme Council, which governed the Scottish Rite in the United States, until a Northern Supr eme Council was established in New York City in 1813. T he boundary between the S outhern and Northern Jurisdictions, still recogn ized today, was firmly established in 1828. Mackey invited Pike to join the Supreme Council for the So uthern Jurisdiction in 1858 in Charleston, and he became the Grand Commander of the S upreme Council the follow ing year. Pike held th at office until his death, while supporting himself in various occupations such as editor of the Memphis Daily Appeal from February 1867 to Se ptember 1868, as well as his law practice. Pike later opened a law office in Washington, D.C., and argued a num ber of cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. However, Pike was impoverished by the Civil War and remained so much of his life, often borrowing money for basic living expenses from the Supreme Council before the council voted him an annuity in 1879 of $1,200 a year for the remainder of his life. He died on April 2, 1892, in Washington, D.C. Realizing that a revision of the ritual was necessary if Scotti sh Rite Freema sonry were to survive, Mackey encouraged Pike to revise the ritual to produce a standard ri tual for use in all states in the Southern Jurisdiction. Revision began in 1855, a nd after some changes, the Supreme Council endorsed Pike's revision in 1861. Minor changes were made in two degrees in 1873 after the York Ri te bodies in Missouri obj ected that the 29th and 30th de grees revealed secrets of the York Rite. Pike is best known for his major work, Morals and Dogma of th e Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, published in 1871.

FORCE, unregulated or ill-regulated, is no t only wasted in the void, like that of gunpowder burned in the open air, and steam unconfined by science; but, striking in the dark, and its blows meeting only t he air, they recoil and bruise itself. It is destruction and ruin. It is the volcano, the earthquake, t he cyclone;-not growth and progress. It is Polyphemus blinded, striki ng at random, and fa lling headlong among the sharp rocks by the impetus of his own blows. The blind Force of the people is a Force th at must be economized, and also managed, as the blind Force of steam, lifting the ponderous iron arms and turning the large wheels, is made to bore and rifle the cannon and to weave the most delicate lace. It must be regulated by Intellect. Intellect is to the peo ple and the people's Force, what the slender needle of the compass is to the ship--its so ul, always counselling the huge mass of wood and iron, and always pointing to the north. To attack the citadels built up on all sides against the human race by superstitions, despotisms, and prejudi ces, the Force must have a brain and a law. Then its deeds of dari ng produce permanent results, and there is real progress. Then there are sublime con quests. Thought is a force, and philosophy should be an energy, finding its aim and its effects in the amelioration of mankind. The two great motors are Truth and Love. When all these Forces are combined, and guided by the Intellect, and regulated by the RULE of Right, and Justice, and of combined and systematic movement and effor t, the great revolution prepare d for by the ages will begin to march. The POWER of th e Deity Himself is in equilibrium with His WISDOM. Hence the only results are HARMONY. It is because Force is ill regulate d, that revolutions prove failures. Theref ore it is that so often insurrections, coming from those high mountains that domineer over the moral horizon, Justice, Wisdom, Reason, Right, buil t of the purest snow of the ideal after a long fall from rock to rock, afte r having reflected the sky in their transparency, and been swollen by a hundred affluents, in the majestic path of triumph, suddenly lose themselves in quagmires, like a California river in the sands. The onward march of the human race requires that the heights around it should blaze with noble and enduring lessons of courage. De eds of daring dazzle history, and form one class of the guiding lights of man. They are the star s and coruscations from that great sea of electricity, the Force inherent in the people. To strive, to brave all risks, to perish, to persevere, to be true to one's self, to grapple body to body with destiny, to surprise defeat by the little te rror it inspires, no w to confront unrighteous power, now to defy intoxicated triumph--these are the exampl es that the nations need and the light that electrifies them. There are immense Forces in the great cave rns of evil beneath society; in the hideous degradation, squalor, wretchedness and destit ution, vices and crimes that reek and simmer in the darkness in that populace below the people, of great cities. There disinterestedness vanishes, every one ho wls, searches, gropes, and gnaws for himself. Ideas are ignored, and of progress there is no thought. This populace has two mothers, both of them stepmothers--Ignorance and Mise ry. Want is their only guide--for the appetite alone they crave satisfaction. Yet even these may be employed. The lowly sand we trample upon, cast into the furnace, me lted, purified by fire, may become resplendent"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"crystal. They have the brute force of t he HAMMER, but their blows help on the great cause, when struck within the lines traced by the RULE held by wisdom and discretion. Yet it is this very Force of the people, this Titanic power of the giants, that builds the fortifications of tyra nts, and is embodied in their armies. Hence t he possibility of such tyrannies as those of which it has been sa id, that \"Rome smells worse under Vitellius than under Sulla. Under Claudius and under Domitian there is a deformity of baseness corresponding to the ugliness-of the tyranny. Th e foulness of the slaves is a direct result of the atrocious baseness of the despot. A miasma exhal es from these crouching consciences that reflect t he master; the public author ities are unclean, hearts are collapsed, consciences shrunken, souls puny. Th is is so under Caracalla, it is so under Commodus, it is so under Heliogabalus, while from the Roman senate, under Caesar, there comes only the rank odour peculiar to the eagle's eyrie.\" It is the force of the people th at sustains all these despotis ms, the basest as well as the best. That force acts through armies; and t hese oftener enslave th an liberate. Despotism there applies the RULE. Force is the MACE of st eel at the saddle-bow of the knight or of the bishop in armour. Passive obedience by force supports thrones and oligarchies, Spanish kings, and Venetian senates. Migh t, in an army wielded by tyranny, is the enormous sum total of utter weakness; and so Humanity wages war against Humanity, in despite of Humanity. So a people willingly subm its to despotism, and its workmen submit to be despised, and its soldiers to be whipped; therefore it is that battles lost by a nation are often progress attained. Less glory is more liberty. When the drum is silent, reason sometimes speaks. Tyrants use the force of the people to chai n and subjugate--that is, enyoke the people. Then they plough with them as men do with oxen yoked. Thus the spirit of liberty and innovation is reduced by bayonets, and prin ciples are struck dumb by cannonshot; while the monks mingle with the troopers, and the Church militant and jubilant, Catholic or Puritan, sings Te Deums fo r victories over rebellion. The military power, not subordinate to the civil power, again the HAMMER or MACE of FORCE, independent of the RULE, is an a rmed tyranny, born full-grown, as Athene sprung from the brain of Zeus. It spawns a dynasty, and begins with Caesar to rot into Vitellius and Commodus. At the pr esent day it inclines to beg in where formerly dynasties ended. Constantly the people put forth immense str ength, only to end in immense weakness. The force of the people is exhausted in indefin itely prolonging things long since dead; in governing mankind by embalming old dead ty rannies of Faith; restoring dilapidated dogmas; regilding faded, worm-eaten shrines; whitening and rouging ancient and barren superstitions; saving society by multiply ing parasites; perpet uating superannuated institutions; enforcing the wors hip of symbols as the actual means of salvation; and tying the dead corpse of the Past, mouth to mouth, wit h the living Present. Therefore it is that it is one of the fatalities of Humanity to be condemned to eternal struggles with phantoms, with superstitions, bigotries, hypocrisies, prej udices, the formulas of error, and the pleas of tyranny. Despotisms, seen in the past, bec ome respectable, as the mountain, bristling with volcanic rock, rugged and horrid, seen th rough the haze of distance is blue and smooth and beautiful. The sight of a single dun geon of tyranny is worth more, to dispel illusions, and create a holy hat red of despotism, and to direct FORCE aright, than the most eloquent volumes. The French should ha ve preserved the Bastile as a perpetual lesson; Italy should not destroy the dungeons of the Inquisition. The Force of the people maintained the Power that built its gloomy cells, and placed the living in their granite sepulchres. The FORCE of the people cannot, by its unrestrained and fitful action, maintain and continue in action and existence a free Govern ment once created. That Force must be limited, restrained, conveyed by distribut ion into different channels, and by roundabout courses, to outlets, whence it is to issue as the law, action, and deci sion of the State; as the wise old Egyptian kings conveyed in diffe rent canals, by sub-division, the swelling"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"waters of the Nile, and compelled them to fertilize and not devastate the land. There must be the jus et norma, the law and Rule, or Gauge, of constitution and law, within which the public force must act. Make a brea ch in either, and the great steam-hammer, with its swift and ponderous blows, crushes a ll the machinery to atoms, and, at last, wrenching itself away, lies inert and dead amid the ruin it has wrought. The FORCE of the people, or the popular will, in action and exerted, symbolized by the GAVEL, regulated and guided by and acti ng within the limits of LAW and ORDER, symbolized by the TWENTY-FOUR-INCH RULE, has for its fruit LIBERTY, EQUALITY, and FRATERNITY,--liberty regulated by law; equality of rights in the eye of the law; brotherhood with its duties and obligations as well as its benefits. You will hear shortly of the Rough ASHLAR and th e Perfect ASHLAR, as part of the jewels of the Lodge. The rough Ashlar is said to be \"a stone, as taken from the quarry, in its rude and natural state.\" The perfect Ashlar is said to be \"a stone made ready by the hands of the workmen, to be adjusted by the working-tools of the Fellow-Craft.\" We shall not repeat the explanations of these symbols given by the York Rite. You may read them in its printed monitors. They are declared to allude to the self-improvement of the individual craftsman,--a continuation of the same superficial interpretation. The rough Ashlar is the PEOPLE, as a mass , rude and unorganized. The perfect Ashlar, or cubical stone, symbol of perfe ction, is the STATE, the rule rs deriving their powers from the consent of the governed; the constitution and laws spea king the will of the people; the government harmonious, symmetrical, ef ficient, --its powers properly distributed and duly adjusted in equilibrium. If we delineate a cube on a plane surface thus: we have visible three faces, and nine external lines, drawn between seven points. The complete cube has three more faces, making six; three more lines, making twelve; and one more point, making eight. As the number 12 includes the sacred numbers, 3, 5, 7, and 3 times 3, or 9, and is produced by addi ng the sacred number 3 to 9; while its own two figures, 1, 2, the unit or monad, and duad, added together, make the same sacred number 3; it was called the perfect number; and the cube became the symbol of perfection. Produced by FORCE, acting by RULE; hammer ed in accordance with lines measured by the Gauge, out of the rough Ashlar, it is an appropriate symbol of the Force of the people, expressed as the constitution and law of the State; and of the State itself the three visible faces represent the three departm ents,--the Executive, which executes the laws; the Legislative, which makes the laws; the Judiciary, which interprets the laws, applies and enforces them, between man and man, between the State and the citizens. The three invisible faces, are Liberty, Equalit y, and Fraternity, the threefold soul of the State--its vitality, spirit, and intellect. Though Masonry neither usurps the place of, nor apes religion, prayer is an essential part of our ceremonies. It is the aspiration of the soul toward the Absolute and Infinite Intelligence, which is the O ne Supreme Deity, most feeb ly and misunderstandingly characterized as an \"ARCHITECT.\" Certain faculties of man are directed toward the Unknown--thought, meditation, prayer. The un known is an ocean, of which conscience is the compass. Thought, meditation, prayer, ar e the great mysterious pointings of the needle. It is a spiritual magnetism that thus connects the human s oul with the Deity. These majestic irradiations of the soul pierce through the shadow toward the light. It is but a shallow scoff to say that prayer is absurd, because it is not possible for us, by means of it, to persuade God to chan ge His plans. He produces foreknown and foreintended effects, by the in strumentality of the forces of nature, all of which are His forces. Our own are part of these. Our fr ee agency and our will are forces. We do not absurdly cease to make effort s to attain wealth or happiness, prolong life, and continue health, because we cannot by any effort change what is predestined. If the effort also is"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"predestined, it is not the less our effort, made of our free will. So, likewise, we pray. Will is a force. Thought is a force. Prayer is a force. Why should it not be of the law of God, that prayer, like Faith and Love, should have it s effects? Man is not to be comprehended as a starting-point, or progress as a goal, without those two great forces, Faith and Love. Prayer is sublime. Orisons that beg and clam our are pitiful. To deny the efficacy of prayer, is to deny that of Faith, Love, and Effort. Yet the effe cts produced, when our hand, moved by our will, la unches a pebble into the ocean , never cease; and every uttered word is registered for et ernity upon the invisible air. Every Lodge is a Temple, and as a whole, and in its details symbolic. The Universe itself supplied man with the model for the first temples reared to the Divinity. The arrangement of the Temple of Solomon, the symbolic or naments which formed its chief decorations, and the dress of the High-Priest, all had refe rence to the order of the Universe, as then understood. The Temple contained many em blems of the seasons--the sun, the moon, the planets, the constellations Ursa Major and Minor, the zodiac, the elements, and the other parts of the world. It is the Master of this Lodge, of the Universe, Hermes, of whom Khurum is the representative, that is one of the lights of the Lodge. For further instruction as to the symbolism of the heavenly bodies, and of the sacred numbers, and of the temple and its details, y ou must wait patiently until you advance in Masonry, in the mean time exercising your in tellect in studying them for yourself. To study and seek to interpret correctly the sym bols of the Universe, is the work of the sage and philosopher. It is to decipher the writin g of God, and penetrate into His thoughts. This is what is asked and answered in our catechism, in regard to the Lodge. * * * * * * A \"Lodge\" is defined to be \"an assemblage of Freemasons, duly c ongregated, having the sacred writings, square, and compass, and a charter, or warrant of constitution, authorizing them to work.\" The room or plac e in which they meet, representing some part of King Solomon's Temple, is also called the Lodge; and it is that we are now considering. It is said to be supported by three great columns, WISDOM, FORCE or STRENGTH, and BEAUTY, represented by the Master, the Seni or Warden, and the Junior Warden; and these are said to be the columns that sup port the Lodge, \"because Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty, are the perfections of everything, and nothing can endure without them.\" \"Because,\" the York Rite says, \"it is necess ary that there should be Wisdom to conceive, Strength to support, and Beauty to adorn, all great and important undertakings.\" \"Know ye not,\" says the Apostle Paul, \"that ye are t he temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man desecrate the temple of God, him shall God destroy, for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.\" The Wisdom and Power of the Deity are in equ ilibrium. The laws of nature and the moral laws are not the mere despot ic mandates of His Omnipoten t will; for, then they might be changed by Him, and order become disorder, and good and right become evil and wrong; honesty and loyalty, vices; and fraud, ingratitude, and vice , virtues. Omnipotent power, infinite, and existing alone, would nec essarily not be constrai ned to consistency. Its decrees and laws could not be immutable. The laws of God are not obligatory on us because they are the enactment s of His POWER, or the expression of His WILL; but because they express His infinite WISDOM. They are not right because they are His laws, but His laws because they are right. Fr om the equilibrium of infinite wisdom and infinite force, results perfect harmony, in physics and in the moral universe. Wisdom, rower, and Harmony constitute one Masoni c triad. They have other and profounder meanings, that may at some time be unveiled to you. As to the ordinary and commonplace explanat ion, it may be added, that the wisdom of the Architect is displa yed in combining, as only a skillf ul Architect can do, and as God has done everywhere,--for example, in the tr ee, the human frame, the egg, the cells of the honeycomb--strength, with grace, beauty, symmetry, pr oportion, lightness,"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"ornamentation. That, too, is the perfection of the orator and poe t--to combine force, strength, energy, with grace of style, musical cadences, the beauty of figures, the play and irradiation of imagination and fancy; and so, in a State, the warlike and industrial force of the people, and their Titanic strength, must be comb ined with the beauty of the arts, the sciences, and the intellect, if the State would scale the heights of excellence, and the people be really free. Harmony in this , as in all the Divine, the material, and the human, is the result of equilibrium, of the sympathy a nd opposite action of contraries; a single Wisdom above them holding the beam of the scales. To reconcile the moral law, human responsibility, free-will, with the absol ute power of God; and the existence of evil with His absolute wisdom, and goodness, and me rcy,-- these are the great enigmas of the Sphynx. You entered the Lodge between tw o columns. They represent the two which stood in the porch of the Temple, on each side of the gr eat eastern gatew ay. These pillars, of bronze, four fingers breadth in thickness, were, accord ing to the most authentic account--that in the First and that in the Second Book of Ki ngs, confirmed in Jeremiah-- eighteen cubits high, with a capital five cubits high. The shaf t of each was four cubits in diameter. A cubit is one foot and 707/1000. That is, the shaft of each was a little over thirty feet eight inches in height, the capital of each a little ov er eight feet six inches in height, and the diameter of the shaft six feet ten inches. The capitals were enric hed by pomegranates of bronze, covered by bronze net-work, and ornamented with wreat hs of bronze; and appear to have imitated the s hape of the seed-vessel of th e lotus or Egyptian lily, a sacred symbol to the Hi ndus and Egyptians. The pillar or co lumn on the righ t, or in the south, was named, as the Hebrew word is rendered in our translation of the Bible, JACHIN: and that on the left BOAZ. Our tran slators say that the first word means, \"He shall establish;\" and the sec ond, \"In it is strength.\" These columns were imitations, by Khurum, the Tyrian artist, of the great columns consecrated to the Winds and Fire, at the entra nce to the famous Temple of Malkarth, in the city of Tyre. It is customary, in Lodges of the York Rite, to see a celestial globe on one, and a terrestrial globe on the other; but these are not wa rranted, if the object be to imitate the original two columns of the Temp le. The symbolic meaning of these columns we shall leave for the present unexplained, only adding t hat Entered Apprentices keep their working-tools in the column JACHIN ; and giving you the etymology and literal meaning of the two names. The word JACHIN, in Hebrew, probably pronou nced Ya-kayan, and meant, as a verbal noun, He that strengthens; and thence, firm, stable, upright. The word Boaz is Baaz which means Strong, Strength, Power, Might, Refuge, Source of Strength, a Fort. The prefix means \"with\" or \"i n,\" and gives the word the force of the Latin gerund, roborando--Strengthening The former word also means he will establish, or plant in an erect position--from the verb Kun, he stood erect. It probably meant Active and Vivifying Energy and Force; and Boaz, Stability, Permanence, in the passive sense. The Dimensions of the Lodge, our Brethren of the York Rite say, \"are unlimited, and its covering no less than the canopy of Heaven.\" \"To this object,\" they say, \"the mason's mind is continually directed, and thither he hopes at last to arrive by the aid of the theological ladder which Jacob in his vision saw ascending from earth to Heaven; the three principal rounds of which are denominat ed Faith, Hope, and Charity; and which admonish us to have Faith in God, Hope in Immortality, and Charity to all mankind.\" Accordingly a ladder, sometimes with nine rounds , is seen on the chart, resting at the bottom on the earth, its top in the clouds, the st ars shining above it; and this is deemed to represent that mystic ladder, which Jacob saw in his dream, set up on the earth, and the top of it reaching to Heaven, with the angel s of God ascending and descending on it. The addition of the three principal rounds to the symbolism, is wholly modern and incongruous. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The ancients counted seven plan ets, thus arranged: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. There were seven heavens and seven spheres of these planets; on all the monuments of Mithras are se ven altars or pyres, consecrated to the seven planets, as were the seven lamps of the golden candelabrum in the Temple. That these represented the planets, we are assu red by Clemens of Alexandria, in his Stromata, and by Philo Judaeus. To return to its sour ce in the Infinite, the human soul , the ancients held, had to ascend, as it had descended, through the seven spher es. The Ladder by which it reascends, has, according to Marsilius Ficinus, in his Commentary on the Ennead of Plotinus, seven degrees or steps; and in the Mysteries of Mi thras, carried to Rome under the Emperors, the ladder, with its seven rounds, was a symbol referring to this ascent through the spheres of the seven planets. Jacob saw the Spirits of God ascending and descending on it; and above it the Deity Himself. The Mith raic Mysteries were ce lebrated in caves, where gates were marked at the four equinoct ial and solstitial points of the Zodiac; and the seven planetary spheres were represented, which souls needs must traverse in descending from the heaven of the fixed star s to the elements that envelop the earth; and seven gates were marked, one for each planet, through which they pass, in descending or returning. We learn this from Celsus, in Origen, who says that the symbolic image of this passage among the stars, used in the Mi thraic Mysteries, was a ladder reaching from earth to Heaven, divided into seven steps or stages , to each of which was a gate, and at the summit an eighth one, that of the fixed stars. The symbol was the same as that of the seven stages of Borsippa, the Py ramid of vitrified brick, near Babylon, built of seven stages, and each of a different colour. In the Mithraic ceremonies , the candidate went through seven stages of initia tion, passing through many fear ful trials--and of these the high ladder with seven rounds or steps was the symbol. You see the Lodge, its details and ornaments, by its Lights. You hav e already heard what these Lights, the greater and lesser, are said to be, and how they are spoken of by our Brethren of the York Rite. The Holy Bible, Square, and Compasses, ar e not only styled the Great Lights in Masonry, but they are also technically calle d the Furniture of the Lodge; and, as you have seen, it is held that there is no Lodge without them. This has sometimes been made a pretext for excluding Jews from our Lo dges, because they cannot regard the New Testament as a holy book. The Bible is an indispensable part of the furniture of a Christian Lodge, only because it is the sacred book of the Christi an religion. The Hebrew Pentateuch in a Hebrew Lodge, and the Kor an in a Mohammedan one, belong on the Altar; and one of these, and the Square and Compass, properly understood, are the Great Lights by which a Mason must walk and work. The obligation of the candidate is always to be taken on the sacred book or books of his religion, that he may deem it more solemn and binding; a nd therefore it was that you were asked of what religion you were. We have no other concern with your religious creed. The Square is a right angle, formed by two ri ght lines. It is adapted only to a plane surface, and belongs only to geometry, earth-measurement, that trigonometry which deals only with planes, and with the earth, wh ich the ancients supposed to be a plane. The Compass describes circles, and deals with spherical trigonometry, the science of the spheres and-heavens. The former, therefore, is an emblem of what concerns the earth and the body; the latter of wh at concerns the heavens and the soul. Yet the Compass is also used in plane trigonometry, as in erec ting perpendiculars; and, therefore, you are reminded that, although in this Degree both points of the Compass are under the Square, and you are now dealing only with the moral a nd political meaning of the symbols, and not with their philosophi cal and spiritual meani ngs, still the divine ever mingles with the human; with the earthly the spiritual intermix es; and there is something spiritual in the commonest duties of life. The nations are not bodies politic alone, but also souls-politic;"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"and woe to that people which, seeking the mate rial only, forgets that it has a soul. Then we have a race, petrified in dogma, which presupposes the absence of a soul and the presence only of memory and instinct, or demo ralized by lucre. Such a nature can never lead civilization. Genuflexion before the idol or the dolla r atrophies the muscle which walks and the will which moves. Hieratic or mercantile absorption diminishes the radiance of a people, lowers its horizon by lo wering its level, and deprives it of that understanding of the universal aim, at the same time human and divine, which makes the missionary nations. A free people, forgetting that it has a soul to be cared for, devotes all its energies to its material advancement. If it makes war, it is to subserve its commercial interests. The citizens copy after the State, and regard wealth, pomp, and luxury as the great goods of life. Such a nation creates weal th rapidly, and distributes it badly. Thence the two extremes, of monstrous opulence and monstrous mise ry; all the enjoyment to a few, all the privations to the rest, that is to say, to the people; Privilege, Exception, Monopoly, Feudality, springing up from Labo ur itself: a false and dangerous situation, which, making Labour a blinded and chained Cycl ops, in the mine, at the forge, in the workshop, at the loom, in the field, over poisonous fumes, in miasmatic cells, in unventilated factories, founds public power upon private misery, and plants the greatness of the State in the suffering of the individual. It is a greatness ill constitu ted, in which all the material elements are combined, and into which no moral element enters. If a people, like a star, has the right of eclipse, the light ought to return. Th e eclipse should not degenerate into night. The three lesser, or the Sublime Lights, you have heard, are the Sun, the Moon, and the Master of the Lodge; and you have heard w hat our Brethren of the York Rite say in regard to them, and why they hold them to be Lights of the Lodge. But the Sun and Moon do in no sense light the Lodge, unless it be symbolically, and then the lights are not they, but those things of which they are the symb ols. Of what they are the symbols the Mason in that Rite is not told. Nor does the Moon in any sense rule the night with regularity. The Sun is the ancient symbol of the life-givi ng and generative power of the Deity. To the ancients, light was the cause of life; and God was the sour ce from which all light flowed; the essence of Light, the Invisible Fire, developed as Flame manifested as light and splendour. The Sun was His manifestatio n and visible image; and the Sabaeans worshipping the Light--God, seemed to wo rship the Sun, in whom they saw the manifestation of the Deity. The Moon was the symbol of the passive capa city of nature to produce, the female, of which the life-giving power and energy was the male. It was the symbol of Isis, Astarte, and Artemis, or Diana. The \"Master of Li fe\" was the Supreme Deity, above both, and manifested through both; Zeus, the Son of Sa turn, become King of the Gods; Horus, son of Osiris and Isis, become the Master of Life ; Dionusos or Bacchus, like Mithras, become the author of Light and Life and Truth. * * * * * The Master of Light and Life, the Sun and the Moon, are symbolized in every Lodge by the Master and Wardens: and this makes it the duty of the Master to dispense light to the Brethren, by himself, and through the Wardens, who are his ministers. \"Thy sun,\" says ISAIAH to Jerusalem, \"sha ll no more go down, neither shall thy moon withdraw itself; for the LORD shall be thi ne everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended. Thy people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land forever.\" Such is the type of a free people. Our northern ancestors worshipped this tr i-une Deity; ODIN, the Almighty FATHER; FREA, his wife, emblem of universal matter; and THOR, his son, the mediator. But above all these was the Supreme God, \"the author of everything that exis teth, the Eternal, the Ancient, the Living and Awful Being, the Sear cher into concealed things, the Being that never changeth.\" In the Temple of Eleusis (a sanctuary lighted only by a window in the"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"roof, and representing the Universe), the imag es of the Sun, Moon, and Mercury, were represented. \"The Sun and Moon,\" says the learned Bro. '. DELAUNAY, \"represent the two grand principles of all generations, the active and passive, the male and the female. The Sun represents the actual light. He pours upon the Moon his fecundating rays; both shed their light upon their offspring, th e Blazing Star, or HORUS, and the three form the great Equilateral Triangle, in the centre of which is the omnifi c letter of the Kabalah, by which creation is said to have been effected.\" The ORNAMENTS of a Lodge are said to be \"the Mosaic Pavement, the Indented Tessel, and the Blazing Star.\" The Mosaic Pavement, chequered in squares or lozenges, is said to represent the ground-floor of King Solomon's Temple; and the Indented Tessel \"that beautiful tessellated border which surrounde d it.\" The Blazing Star in the centre is said to be \"an emblem of Divine Provid ence, and commemorative of the star which appeared to guide the wise men of the East to the place of our Saviour's nativity.\" But \"there was no stone seen\" within the Temple . The walls were covered with planks of cedar, and the floor was covered with planks of fir. There is no evidence that there was such a pavement or floor in the Temple, or such a bordering. In England, anciently, the Tracing-Board was surrounded with an indented border; and it is only in America that such a border is put around the Mosaic pavement. The tesserae, indeed, are the squares or lozenges of the pavement. In England, also, \"the indented or d enticulated border\" is called \"tessellated,\" because it has four \"t assels,\" said to represent Temperance, Fortitude, Prudence, and Justice. It was termed the Indented Trassel; but this is a misuse of words. It is a tesserated pavement, with an indented border round it. The pavement, alternately black and white, symbolizes, whether so intended or not, the Good and Evil Principles of the Egyptian and Persian creed. It is the warfare of Michael and Satan, of the Gods and Titans, of Ba lder and Lok; between light and shadow, which is darkness; Day and Night; Freedom and Desp otism; Religious Liberty and the Arbitrary Dogmas of a Church that thin ks for its votaries, and whose Po ntiff claims to be infallible, and the decretals of its Counc ils to constitute a gospel. The edges of this pavement, if in lozenges , will necessarily be indented or denticulated, toothed like a saw; and to complete and finish it a bordering is nec essary. It is completed by tassels as ornaments at the corners. If these and the bordering have any symbolic meaning, it is fanciful and arbitrary. To find in the BLAZING STAR of five points an allusion to the Divine Providence, is also fanciful; and to make it commemorative of the Star that is said to have guided the Magi, is to give it a meaning comparatively modern. Originally it represented SIRIUS, or the Dog-star, the fore runner of the inu ndation of the Nile; the G od ANUBIS, companion of ISIS in her search for the body of OSIRIS, her brother and husband. Then it became the image of HORUS, the son of OS IRIS, himself symbolized also by the Sun, the author of the Seasons, and the God of Time; Son of ISIS, who was the universal nature, himself the primitive matter, inexhaustible source of Life, spark of uncreated fire, universal seed of all beings. It was HERMES, also, the Master of Learning, whose name in Greek is that of the God Mercury. It became the sacred an d potent sign or character of the Magi, the PENTALPHA, and is the significant emblem of Liberty and Freedom, blazing with a steady radiance amid the weltering element s of good and evil of Revolutions, and promising serene skies and fertile seasons to the nations, a fter the storms of change and tumult. In the East of the Lodge, over the Master, inclosed in a triangle, is the Hebrew letter YOD. In the English and American Lodges the Letter G.'. is substituted for this, as the initial of the word GOD, with as little reason as if the letter D., initial of DIEU, were used in French Lodges instead of the proper lett er. YOD is, in the Kabalah, the symbol of Unity, of the Supreme Deity, the first letter of the Holy Name; and also a symbol of the Great Kabalistic Triads. To understand its my stic meanings, you must open the pages of the Sohar and Siphra de Zeniutha, and othe r kabalistic books, and ponder deeply on"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"their meaning. It must suffice to say, that it is the Creative Ener gy of the Deity, is represented as a point, and that point in the cent re of the Circle of immens ity. It is to us in this Degree, the symbol of th at unmanifested Deity, the Absolute, who has no name. Our French Brethren place this letter YOD in the centre of the Blazing Star. And in the old Lectures, our ancient English Brethren said, \"The Blazing Star or Glory in the centre refers us to that grand luminary, the Sun, which enlightens the ear th, and by its genial influence dispenses blessings to mankind.\" They called it also in the same lectures, an emblem of PRUDENCE. The word Prudentia means, in its original and fullest signification, Foresight; and, accordingly, the Blazing Star has been regarded as an emblem of Omniscience, or the All-seeing Ey e, which to the Egyp tian Initiates was the emblem of Osiris, the Creator. With the YOD in the centre, it has the kabalistic meaning of the Divine Energy, manifested as Light, creating the Universe. The Jewels of the Lodge are said to be six in number. Three are called \"Movable,\" and three \"Immovable.\" Th e SQUARE, the LEVEL, and the PLUMB were anciently and properly called the Movable Jewels, because th ey pass from one Brother to another. It is a modern innovation to call them immovable, because they must always be present in the Lodge. The immovable jewels are th e ROUGH ASHLAR, the PERFECT ASHLAR or CUBICAL, STONE, or, in some Rituals, th e DOUBLE CUBE, and the TRACING-BOARD, or TRESTLE-BOARD. Of these jewels our Brethren of the York Rit e say: \"The Square inculcates Morality; the Level, Equality; and the Plumb, Rectitude of Conduct.\" Their explanation of the immovable Jewels may be read in their monitors. Our Brethren of the York Rite say that \"the re is represented in every well-governed Lodge, a certain point, within a circle; the point representing an individual Brother; the Circle, the boundary line of his conduct, beyond which he is never to suffer his prejudices or passions to betray him.\" This is not to interpret th e symbols of Masonry. It is said by some, with a nearer approach to interpretation, that the point within the circle represents God in the centre of the Universe. It is a common Egyptian sign fo r the Sun and Osiris, and is still used as the astronomical sign of the great luminary. In th e Kabalah the point is YOD, the Creative Energy of God, irradiating with light the circ ular space which God, the universal Light, left vacant, wherein to create the worlds, by wi thdrawing His substance of Light back on all sides from one point. Our Brethren add that, \"this circle is embo rdered by two perpendicular parallel lines, representing Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist, and upon the top rest the Holy Scriptures\" (an open book). \"In going round this circle,\" they say, \"we necessarily touch upon these two lines as we ll as upon the Holy Scriptures; and while a Mason keeps himself circumscribed within their precepts, it is impossible that he should materially err.\" It would be a waste of time to comment upon this. Some writers have imagined that the parallel lines represent the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, which the Sun alternately touches upon at the Summer and Winter solsti ces. But the tropics are not perpendicular lines, and the idea is merely fanciful. If t he parallel lines ever belonged to the ancient symbol, they had some more recondite and more fruitful meaning. They probably had the same meaning as the twin columns Jachin and Boaz. That meaning is not for the Apprentice. The adept may find it in the Kabalah. The JUSTICE and MERCY of God are in equilibrium, and the result is HARMON Y, because a Single and Perfect Wisdom presides over both. The Holy Scriptures are an entirely modern addition to the symbol, like the terrestrial and celestial globes on the columns of the portico. Thus the ancient symbol has been denaturalized by incongruous addi tions, like that of Isis weeping over the broken column containing the remains of Osiris at Byblos."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" * * * * * * Masonry has its decalogue, wh ich is a law to its Initiates. These are its Ten Commandments: I. God is the Eternal, Omnipotent, Immu table WISDOM and Supreme INTELLIGENCE and Exhaustless Love. Thou shalt adore, revere, and love Him ! Thou shalt honour Him by practising the virtues! II. Thy religion shall be, to do good because it is a pleasure to thee, and not merely because it is a duty. That thou mayest become the friend of th e wise man, thou shalt obey his precepts ! Thy soul is immortal ! Thou shalt do nothing to degrade it ! III. Thou shalt unceasingly war against vice! Thou shalt not do unto others that which thou wouldst not wish them to do unto thee ! Thou shalt be submissive to thy fortunes, and keep burning the light of wisdom ! IV. Thou shalt honour thy parents ! Thou shalt pay respect and homage to the aged! Thou shalt instruct the young! Thou shalt protect and defend infancy and innocence ! V. Thou shalt cherish thy wife and thy children! Thou shalt love thy country, and obey its laws! VI. Thy friend shall be to thee a second self ! Misfortune shall not estrange thee from him ! Thou shalt do for his memory whatever thou wouldst do for him, if he were living! VII. Thou shalt avoid and flee from insincere friendships ! Thou shalt in everything refrain from excess. Thou shalt fear to be the caus e of a stain on thy memory! VIII. Thou shalt allow no passions to become thy master ! Thou shalt make the passions of othe rs profitable lessons to thyself!

Thou shalt not misuse either th y strength or thy superiority ! X. Thou shalt study to know men; that th ereby thou mayest lear n to know thyself ! Thou shalt ever s eek after virtue ! Thou shalt be just! Thou shalt avoid idleness ! But the great commandment of Masonry is this: \"A new co mmandment give I unto you: that ye love one another! He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, remaineth still in the darkness.\" Such are the moral duties of a Mason. But it is also the duty of Masonry to assist in elevating the moral and intellectual level of so ciety; in coining know ledge, bringing ideas into circulation, and causing the mind of youth to grow; a nd in putting, gradually, by the teachings of axioms and the promulgation of positive laws, the human race in harmony with its destinies."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" To this duty and work the Initiate is apprentic ed. He must not imagine that he can effect nothing, and, therefore, despairing, become iner t. It is in this, as in a man's daily life. Many great deeds are done in the small struggles of life. There is, we are told, a determined though unseen bravery, which defends itself, foot to foot, in the darkness, against the fatal invasion of necessity and of baseness. There ar e noble and mysterious triumphs, which no eye sees, which no reno wn rewards, which no flourish of trumpets salutes. Life, misfortune, isolation, abandonm ent, poverty, are battle-fields, which have their heroes,--heroes obscure, but sometimes gr eater than those who become illustrious. The Mason should struggle in the same ma nner, and with the same bravery, against those invasions of necessity and baseness, which come to nations as well as to men. He should meet them, too, foot to foot, even in the darkness, a nd protest agains t the national wrongs and follies; against usurpa tion and the first inroads of that hydra, Tyranny. There is no more sovereign eloquence than the truth in indignation. It is more difficult for a people to keep than to gain their freedo m. The Protests of Truth are always needed. Continually, the right must protes t against the fact. There is, in fact, Eternity in the Right. The Mason should be the Priest and Soldier of that Right. If his country should be robbed of her liberties, he should still not despair. The protest of the Ri ght against the Fact persists forever. The robbery of a people neve r becomes prescriptive. Reclamation of its rights is barred by no length of time. Warsaw can no more be Tartar than Venice can be Teutonic. A people may endure military usur pation, and subjugated States kneel to States and wear the yoke, while under the st ress of necessity; bu t when the necessity disappears, if the people is fit to be free, the submerged country will float to the surface and reappear, and Tyranny be adjudged by History to have murdered its victims. Whatever occurs, we should have Faith in the Justice and overruling Wisdom of God, and Hope for the Future, and Lovingkindness for those who are in error. God makes visible to men His will in event s; an obscure text, written in a mysterious language. Men make their translations of it forthwith, has ty, incorrect, full of faults, omissions, and misreadings. We see so short a way along the arc of the great circle! Few minds comprehend the Divine tongue. The most sagaci ous, the most calm, the most profound, decipher the hieroglyphs slow ly; and when they arrive with their text, perhaps the need has long gone by; there are already twenty trans lations in the public square--the most incorrect being, as of course, the most ac cepted and popular. From each translation, a party is born; and from each misreading, a fact ion. Each party believes or pretends that it has the only true text, and ea ch faction believes or pretends that it alone possesses the light. Moreover, factions are blind men, who ai m straight, errors are excellent projectiles, striking skillfully, and with all the violence that spri ngs from false reasoning, wherever a want of logic in those who defend the righ t, like a defect in a cuirass, makes them vulnerable. Therefore it is that we shall often be disc omfited in combating error before the people. Antaeus long resisted Hercules; and the heads of the Hydra gr ew as fast as they were cut off. It is absurd to sa y that Error, wounded, writhes in pain, and dies amid her worshippers. Truth conquers slowly. There is a wondrous vitality in Error. Truth, indeed, for the most part, shoots over the heads of th e masses; or if an error is prostrated for a moment, it is up again in a moment, and as vigorous as ev er. It will not die when the brains are out, and the most stupid and ir rational errors are the longest-lived. Nevertheless, Maso nry, which is Morality and Philosophy , must not cease to do its duty. We never know at what moment success awaits our efforts--generally when most unexpected--nor with what effect our efforts are or are not to be attended. Succeed or fail, Masonry must not bow to error, or succumb under discouragement. There were at Rome a few Carthaginian soldiers, taken pris oners, who refused to bow to Flaminius, and had a little of Hannibal's magnanimity. Masons should possess an equal greatness of soul. Masonry should be an energy; finding its aim and effect in the amelioration of mankind. Socrates should enter into Adam , and produce Marcus Aurelius, in other words, bring forth from the man of enjoyment s, the man of wisdom. Masonry should not be a mere watch-tower, built upon mystery, fr om which to gaze at ease upon the world, with no other result than to be a convenience for the curious. To hold the full cup of"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"thought to the thirsty lips of men; to give to all the true ideas of Deity; to harmonize conscience and science, are the province of Philosophy. Morality is Faith in full bloom. Contemplation should lead to action, and the abs olute be practical; the ideal be made air and food and drink to the human mind. Wisdom is a sacred communion. It is only on that condition that it ceases to be a sterile love of Science, and becomes the one and supreme method by which to unite Humanity and arouse it to concerted action. Then Philosophy becomes Religion. And Masonry, like History and Philosophy, has eternal duties-- eterna l, and, at the same time, simple--to oppose Caiaphas as Bishop, Dr aco or Jefferies as Judge, Trimalcion as Legislator, and Tiberius as Emperor. These ar e the symbols of the tyranny that degrades and crushes, and the corruption that defile s and infests. In the works published for the use of the Craft we are told that the thr ee great tenets of a Ma son's profession, are Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth. And it is true that a Brotherly affection and kindness should govern us in all our intercourse an d relations with our brethren; and a generous and liberal philanthropy actuate us in regard to all men. To relieve the distressed is peculiarly the duty of Masons--a sacred duty, no t to be omitted, neglected, or coldly or inefficiently complied with. It is also most true, that Truth is a Divine attribute and the foundation of every virtue. To be true, and to seek to find and learn the Truth, are the great objects of every good Mason. As the Ancients did, Masonry styles Temper ance, Fortitude, Prudenc e, and Justice, the four cardinal virtues. They ar e as necessary to nations as to individuals. The people that would be Free and Independent, must possess Sagacity, Forethought, Foresight, and careful Circumspection, all which are included in the meaning of the word Prudence. It must be temperate in asserting its rights, te mperate in its councils , economical in its expenses; it must be bold, brave, courageo us, patient under reverses, undismayed by disasters, hopeful amid calami ties, like Rome when she sold the field at which Hannibal had his camp. No Cannae or Pharsalia or Pavia or Agincourt or Waterloo must discourage her. Let her Senate sit in their se ats until the Gauls pluck them by the beard. She must, above all things, be just, not tr uckling to the strong and warring on or plundering the weak; she must act on the squar e with all nations, and the feeblest tribes; always keeping her faith, honest in her legi slation, upright in all her dealings. Whenever such a Republic exists, it will be immortal: for rashness, injustic e, intem perance and luxury in prosperity, and despair and disorder in adversity, are t he causes of the decay and dilapidation of nations."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" MORALS and DOGMA by ALBERT PIKE Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry , prepared for the Supreme Council of the Thirty Third Degree for the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States: Charleston, 1871. 2º - Fellow-craft In the Ancient Orient, all religion was more or less a mystery and there was no divorce from it of philosophy. The popular theology , taking the multitude of allegories and symbols for realities, degenerated into a worshi p of the celestial luminaries, of imaginary Deities with human feelings, passions, appetites , and lusts, of idols, stones, animals, reptiles. The Onion was sacred to the Egyptians, because its different layers were a symbol of the concentric heave nly spheres. Of course th e popular religion could not satisfy the deeper longings and thoughts, the loft ier aspirations of the Spirit, or the logic of reason. The first, therefore, was taught to the initiated in th e Mysteries. There, also, it was taught by symbols. The vagueness of symb olism, capable of many interpretations, reached what the palpable and conventiona l creed could not. Its indefiniteness acknowledged the abstruseness of the subj ect: it treated that mysterious subject mystically: it endeavored to illustrate what it could not explain; to excite an appropriate feeling, if it could not develop an adequ ate idea; and to rmake the image a mere subordinate conveyance for t he conception, which itself never became obvious or familiar. Thus the knowledge now imparted by books and letters, was of old conveyed by symbols; and the priests invent ed or perpetuated a display of rites and exhibitions, which were not only more attractive to the eye than words, but often more suggestive and more pregnant with meaning to the mind. Masonry, successor of the Mysteries, still fo llows the ancient man ner of teaching. Her ceremonies are like the ancient mystic shows,--not the r eading of an essay, but the opening of a problem, requiring research , and constituting philosophy the arch- expounder. Her symbols are the instruction s he gives. The lectures are endeavors, often partial and one-sided, to interpret these symbols. He who would become an accomplished Mason must not be content mere ly to hear, or even to understand, the lectures; he must, aided by them, and they having, as it were, marked out the way for him, study, interpret, and dev elop these symbols for himself * * * * * * Though Masonry is identical with the ancient Mysteries, it is so only in this qualified sense: that it presents but an imperfect image of their brillia ncy, the ruins only of their grandeur, and a system that has experienced progressive alterati ons, the fruits of social events, political circumstances, and the ambi tious imbecility of its improvers. After leaving Egypt, the Mysteries were modified by the habits of the different nations among whom they were introduced, and especially by the religious systems of the countries into which they were transplanted. To mainta in the established government, laws, and religion, was the obligation of the Initiate everywhere; a nd everywhere they were the heritage of the priests, who were nowhere willing to make the common people co- proprietors with themselves of philosophical truth. Masonry is not the Coliseum in ruins. It is rather a Roman palace of the middle ages, disfigured by moderll architectural improv ements, yet built on a Cyclopcean foundation laid by the Etruscans, and wit h many a stone of t he superstructure taken from dwellings and temples of the age of Hadrian and Antoninus."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Christianity taught the doctrine of FRATER NITY; but repudiated that of political EQUALITY, by continually incu lcating obedience to Caesar, and to those lawfully in authority. Masonry was the first apostle of EQ UALITY. In the Monastery there is fraternity and equality, but no liberty. Masonry added th at also, and claimed for man the three-fold heritage, LIBERTY, EQUALITY, and FRATERNITY. It was but a development of the original pur pose of the Mysteries, which was to teach men to know and practice their duties to th emselves and their fellows, the great practical end of all philosophy and all knowledge. Truths are the springs from which duties flow ; and it is but a few hundred years since a new Truth began to be distinctly seen; th at MAN IS SUPREME OVER INSTITUTIONS, AND NOT THEY OVER HIM. Man has natural empire over all institutions. They are for him, aecording to his development; not he fo r them. This seems to us a very simple statement, one to which all men, everywhere, ought to assent. But once it was a great new Truth,--not revealed until governments had been in existence for at least five thousand years. Once revealed, it imposed ne w duties on men. Man owed it to himself to be free. He owed it to his country to seek to give her freedom, or maintain her in that possession. It made Tyranny and Usurpation the enemies of the Human Race. It created a general outlawry of Despots and Despotis ms, temporal and spiritual. The sphere of Duty was immensely enlarged. Patriotism had, henceforth, a new and wider meaning. Free Government, Free Thought, Free Conscience, Free Speech! All these came to be inalienable rights, which those who had part ed with them or been robbed of them, or whose ancestors had lost them, had the right summarily to retake. Unfortunately, as Truths always become perverted into false hoods, and are falsehoods when misapplied, this Truth became the Gospel of Anarch y, soon after it was first preached. Masonry early comprehended this Truth, a nd recognized its own enlarged duties. Its symbols then came to have a wider meaning; but it also assumed the mask of Stone- masonry, and borrowed its working-tools, and so was supplied with new and apt symbols. It aided in bringing about the French Revolution, disappeared with the Girondists, was born again with the restor ation of order, and sustained Napoleon, because, though Emperor, he ac knowledged the right of the peop le to select its rulers, and was at the head of a nation refusing to receive back its old kings. He pleaded, with sabre, musket, and cannon, the great cause of the People against Royalty, the right of the French people even to make a Corsican General their Emperor, if it pleased them. Masonry felt that this Truth had the Omnipo tence of God on its si de; and that neither Pope nor Potentate could overcome it. It was a truth dropped into the world's wide treasury, and forming a part of the herit age which each generation receives, enlarges, and holds in trust, and of necessity bequeaths to mankind; the personal estate of man, entailed of nature to the end of time. And Masonr y early recognized it as true, that to set forth and develop a truth, or any human excellenc e of gift or growth, is to make greater the spiritual glory of the race; that whosoeve r aids the march of a Truth, and makes the thought a thing, writ es in the same line with MOSES, and with Him who died upon the cross; and has an intellectual sym pathy with the Deity Himself. The best gift we can bestow on man is manhood . It is that which Masonry is ordained of God to bestow on its votaries: not sectarianism and religious dogma; not a rudimental morality, that may be found in the writings of Confucius, Zoroas ter, Seneca, and the Rabbis, in the Proverbs and Ecclesia stes; not a little and cheap common-school knowledge; but manhood and science and philosophy. Not that Philosophy or Science is in opposit ion to Religion. For Philosophy is but that knowledge of God and the Soul, which is deri ved from observation of the manifested action of God and the Soul, and from a wise analogy. It is the intellectual guide which the religious sentiment needs. The true religious philosophy of an imperfect being, is not a system of creed, but, as SOCRATES though t, an infinite search or approximation."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Philosophy is that intellectual and moral progr ess, which the religious sentiment inspires and ennobles. As to Science, it could not wa lk alone, while religion was stat ionary. It consists of those matured inferences from experience which all other experience co nfirms. It realizes and unites all that was truly valuable in both th e old schemes of mediation,--one heroic, or the system of action and effort; and the mystic al theory of spiritual, ccntemplative commullion. \"Listen to me,\" says GALEN, \"a s to the voice of the Eleusinian Hierophant, and believe that the study of Nature is a my stery no less important than theirs, nor less adapted to display the wisdom and power of the Great Creator. Their lessons and demonstrations were obscure, but ours are clear and unmistakable.\" We deem that to be the best knowledge we c an obtain of the Soul of another man, which is furnished by his actions and his life-long c onduct. Evidence to the contrary, supplied by what another man informs us that this Soul has said to his, would weigh little against the former. The first Scriptures for the human race were written by God on the Earth and Heavens. The reading of these Scriptures is Science. Familiarity with the grass and trees, the insects and the infusoria, teaches us deeper lessons of love and faith than we can glean from the writings of FENELON an d AUGUSTINE. The great Bible of God is ever open before mankind. Knowledge is convertible into power, and axioms into rules of utility and duty. But knowledge itself is not Power. Wisdom is Po wer; and her Prime Minister is JUSTICE, which is the perfected law of TRUTH. The pu rpose, therefore, of Education and Science is to make a man wise. If knowledge does not make him so, it is wasted, like water poured on the sands. To know the formulas of Ma sonry, is of as little value, by itself, as to know so many words and sentences in some barbarous African or Australasian dialect. To know even the mean ing of the symbols, is but lit tle, unless that adds to our wisdom, and also to our charity, which is to ju stice like one hemisphere of the brain to the other. Do not lose sight, then, of the true object of your studies in Masonry. It is to add to your estate of wisdom, and not merely to your knowledge. A man may spend a lifetime in studying a single specialty of knowledge,-- botany, conchology, or entomology, for instance,--in committing to memory names der ived from the Greek, and classifying and reclassifying; and yet be no wiser than when he b egan. It is the great truths as to all that most concerns a man, as to his rights, intere sts, and duties, that Masonry seeks to teach her Initiates. The wiser a man becomes, the less will he be inclined to subm it tamely to the imposition of fetters or a yoke, on his conscience or his person. For, by increase of wisdom he not only better knows his rights, but the more hi ghly values them, and is more conscious of his worth and dignity. His pride then urges him to assert his independence. He becomes better able to assert it also; and better able to assist others or hi s country, when they or she stake all, even existence, upon the same assertion. But mere knowledge makes no one independent, nor fits him to be free. It often only makes him a more useful slave. Liberty is a curse to the ignorant and brutal. Political science has for its object to asce rtain in what manner and by means of what institutions political and per sonal freedom may be secured and perpetuated: not license, or the mere right of every ma n to vote, but entire and absolute freedom of thought and opinion, alike free of the despotism of mona rch and mob and prelate; freedom of action within the limits of the general la w enacted for all; the Courts of Justice, with impartial Judges and juries, open to all alike; weak ness and poverty equally potent in those Court.s as power and wealth; the avenues to office and honor open alike to all the worthy; the military powers, in war oY peaee, in strict subor dination to the civil power; arbitrary arrests for acts not known to the la w as crimes, impossible; Romish Inquisitions, Star-Chambers, Military Commissions, unknown; the means of instruct ion within reach of"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"the children of all; the right of Free Speech; and accountability of a ll public omcers, civil and military. If Masonry needed to be justified for imposi ng political as well as moral duties on its Initiates, it would be enough to point to the sad history of the world. It would not even need that she should turn back the pages of history to the chapters written by Tacitus: that she should recite the incredible horrors of despotism under Caligula and Domitian, Caracalla and Commodus, Vitellius and Maximin. She need only point to the centuries of calamity through which the gay French nation passed; to the long oppression of the feudal ages, of the selfish Bourbon kings; to those times when the peasants were robbed and slaughtered by their own lords and prin ces, like sheep; when the lord claimed the firstfruits of the peasant's marriage-bed; when the captured city was given up to merciless rape and massacre; when the State- prisons groaned with i nnocent victims, and the Church blessed the banners of pitiless murderers, and sang Te Deums for the crowning mercy of the Eve of St. Bartholomew. We might turn over the pages, to a later chapte r,--that of the reign of the Fifteenth Louis, when young girls, hardly more than children, were kidnapped to serve his lusts; when lettres de cachet filled the Ba stile with persons accused of no crime, with husbands who were in the way of the pleasures of lascivi ous wives and of villain s wearing orders of nobility; when the people were ground between the upper and the nether millstone of taxes, customs, and excises; and when the Pope's Nuncio and the Cardinal de la Roche- Ayman, devoutly kneeling, one on each si de of Madame du Barry, the king's abandoned prostitute, put the slippers on her naked fee t, as she rose from the adulterous bed. Then, indeed, suffering and toil were the two forms of man, and the people were but beasts of burden. The true Mason is he who labors strenuously to help his Order effect its great purposes. Not that the Order can effect t hem by itself; but that it, too, can help. It also is one of God's instruments. It is a Force and a Power; and shame upon it, if it did not exert itself, and, if need be, sacrihce its children in the cause of humanity, as Abraham was ready to offer up Isaac on the altar of sacrifice. It w ill not forget that noble allegory of Curtius leaping, all in armor, into the great yawning gul f that opened to sw allow Rome. It will TRY. It shall not be its fault if the day nev er comes when man will no l onger have to fear a conquest, an invasion, a usurpation, a rivalry of nations with the armed hand, an interruption of civiliz ation depending on a marr iage-royal, or a birth in the hereditary tyrannies; a partition of the peoples by a Congress, a dism emberment by the downfall of a dynasty, a combat of two religions, meetin g head to head, like two goats of darkness on the bridge of the Infinite: when they will no longer have to fear famine, spoliation, prostitution from distress, misery from la ck of work, and all the brigandages of chance in the forest of events: when nations will gravitat e about the Truth, like stars about the light, each in its own orbit, without clashing or collision; and everywhere Freedom, cinctured with stars, crowned with the celestial spl endors, and with wisdom and justice on either hand, will reign supreme. In your studies as a Fellow-Craft you mu st be guided by REASON, LOVE and FAITH. We do not now discuss the differences between Reason and Faith, and undertake to define the domain of each. But it is necessary to say, that even in the ordinary affairs of life we are governed far more by what we believe than by what we know; by FAITH and ANALOGY, than by REASON. Th e \"Age of Reason\" of the French Revo lution taught, we know, what a folly it is to enthrone Reason by itself as supreme. Reason is at fault when it deals with the Infinite. There we must revere and believe. Notwithstanding the calamities of the virtuous, the miseries of t he deserving, the prosperi ty of tyrants and the murder of martyrs, we must believe there is a wise, just, merciful, and loving God, an Intelligence and a Provid ence, supreme over all, and cari ng for the minute st things and events. A Faith is a necessity to ma n. Woe to him who believes nothing!"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"We believe that the soul of another is of a certain nature and possesses certain qualities, that he is generous and honest, or penuri ous and knavish, that she is virtuous and amiable, or vicious and ill-tempered, from t he countenance alone, from little more than a glimpse of it, without the means of knowing. We venture our fo rtune on the signature of a man on the other side of the world, whom we never saw, upon the belief that he is honest and trustworthy. We believe that occurrenc es have taken place, upon the assertion of others. We believe that one will acts upon another, and in the reality of a multitude of other phenomena that Reason cannot explain. But we ought not to believe what Reason autho ritatively denies, that at which the sense of right revolts, that which is absurd or self -contradictory, or at issue with experience or science, or that which degrades the charac ter of the Deity, and would make Him revengeful, malignant, cruel, or unjust. A man's Faith is as much his own as his R eason is. His Freedom consists as much in his faith being free as in his will being uncontrolled by power. All the Pr iests and Augurs of Rome or Greece had not the right to require Cicero or Socrates to believe in the absurd mythology of the vulgar. All the Imaums of Mohammedanism have not the right to require a Pagan to believe that Gabriel dictated the Koran to the Prophet. All the Brahmins that ever lived, if assembled in one conclave lik e the Cardinals, could not gain a right to compel a single human being to believe in the Hindu Cosmogony. No man or body of men can be infallible, an d authorized to decide what othe r men shall believe, as to any tenet of faith. Except to those who first re ceive it, every religion and the truth of all inspired writings depend on human testimony and internal evidences, to be judged of by Reason and the wise analogies of Faith. Each man must necessarily have the right to judge of their truth for himself; because no one man can have any higher or better right to judge than another of equal information and intelligence. Domitian claimed to be the Lord God; and st atues and images of him, in silver and gold, were found throughout the know n world. He claimed to be regarded as the God of all men; and, according to Suetonius, began hi s letters thus: \"Our Lord and God commands that it should be done so and so;\" and formally decreed that no one should address him otherwise, either in writing or by word of mouth. Palfurius Sura, the philosopher, who was his chief delator, accusing those who refused to recognize his divinity, however much he may have believed in that divinity, had not t he right to demand that a single Christian in Rome or the provinces should do the same. Reason is far from being the only guide, in mora ls or in political science. Love or loving- kindness must keep it company, to exclude fanaticism, intole rance, and persecution, to all of which a morality too ascetic, and extr eme political principles, invariably lead. We must also have faith in ourselves, and in our fellows and the people, or we shall be easily discouraged by reverses, and our ardor cool ed by obstacles. We must not listen to Reason alone. Force comes more from Faitll an d Love: and it is by th e aid of these that man scales the loftiest heights of morality, or becomes the Saviour and Redeemer of a People. Reason must hold the helm; but these supply the mo tive power. They are the wings of the soul. Enthusiasm is generally unreasoning; and wit hout it, and Love and Faith, there would have been no RIENZI, or TELL, or SYDNEY, or any other of the great patriots whose names are immortal. If t he Deity had been merely and only All-wise and All-mighty, He would never have created the Universe. * * * * * * It is GENIUS that gets Power; and its prime lieutenants are FORCE and WISDOM. The unruliest of men bend before the leader that has the sense to see and the will to do. It is Genius that rules with God-like Power; t hat unveils, with its counsellors, the hidden human mysteries, cuts asunder with its word the huge knots, and builds up with its word the crumbled ruins. At its glance fall down the senseless idols, whose altars have been on all the high places and in all the sacred groves. Dishonesty and imbecility stand"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"abashed before it. Its single Yea or Nay revo kes the wrongs of ages, and is heard among the future generations. Its power is immense, because its wisdom is immense. Genius is the Sun of the political sphere. Force and Wis dom, its ministers, are the orbs that carry its light into darkness, and answer it with their solid reflecting Truth. Development is symbolized by the use of the Mallet and Chisel; the development of the energies and intellect, of the individual and t he people. Genius may place itself at the head of an unintellectual, uneducated, unener getic nation; but in a free country, to cultivate the intellect of those who elect, is the only mode of securing intellect and genius for rulers. The world is seldom ruled by the gr eat spirits, except af ter dissolution and new birth. In periods of transiti on and convulsion, the Long Parlia ments, the Robespierres and Marats, and the semi-res pectabilities of intelle ct, too often hold the reins of power. The Cromwells and Napoleons come later. After Marius and Sulla and Cicero the rhetorician, CAESAR. The great in tellect is often too sharp for the gr anite of this life. Legislators may be very ordinary men; for legislation is very ordinary work; it is but the final issue of a million minds. The power of the purse or the sword, compar ed to that of the spirit, is poor and contemptible. As to lands, you may have agra rian laws, and equal partition. But a man's intellect is all his own, held direct from God, an inalienable fief. It is the most potent of weapons in the hands of a paladin. If th e people comprehend Force in the physical sense, how much more do tlley revelence the intellectual! Ask Hildebrand, or Luther, or Loyola. They fall prostrate before it, as befor e an idol. The mastery of mind over mind is the only conquest worth having. The other inju res both, and dissolves at a breath; rude as it is, the great cable falls down and s naps at last. But this dimly resembles the dominion of the Creator. It does not need a s ubject like that of Pete r the Hermit. If the stream be but bright and strong, it will sweep like a spri ng-tide to the popular heart. Not in word only, but in intellectual act lies the fasc ination. It is the homage to the Invisible. This power, knotted with Love, is the golden chain let down into the well of Truth, or the invisible chain that binds t he ranks of mankind together. Influence of man over man is a law of nature, wh ether it be by a great estate in land or in intellect. It may mean slavery, a deference to the eminent human judgment. Society hangs spiritually together, lik e the revoiving spheres above. The free country, in which intellect and genius gov ern, will endure. Where they serve, and other influences govern, the national life is short. All the nations that have tried to govern themselves by their smallest, by the incapables, or merely respec tables, have come to nought. Constitutions and Laws, without Genius and Intellect to govern, will not prevent decay. In that case they have the dry-rot and the life dies out of them by degrees. To give a nation the franchise of the Intellect is the only sure mode of perpetuating freedom. This will compel exer tion and generous care for th e people from those on the higher seats, and honorable and intelligent a llegiance from those be low. Then political public life will protect all men from self-abasement in sensual pursuits, from vulgar acts and low greed, by giving the noble ambition of just imperial rule. To elevate the people by teaching loving-kindness and wisdom, with power to him who teaches best: and so to develop the free State from the rough ashlar:- - this is the great labor in which Masonry desires to lend a helping hand. All of us should labor in building up the great monument of a nation, the Holy House of the Temple. The cardinal virtues must no t be partitioned among men, becoming the exclusive property of some, like the common crafts. ALL are apprenticed to the partners, Duty and Honor. Masonry is a march and a struggle toward t he Light. For the individual as well as the nation, Light is Virtue, Manlines s, Intelligence, Liberty. Tyranny over the soul or body, is darkness. The freest people, lik e the freest man, is always in danger of relapsing into servitude. Wars are almost always fatal to Republics. They create tyrants, and"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"consolidate their power. They spring, for the most part, from evil counsels. When the small and the base are intrusted with power, legislation and administration become but two parallel series of errors and blunders, endi ng in war, calamity, and the necessity for a tyrant. When the nation feels its feet sliding backward, as if it walk ed on the ice, the time has come for a supreme effort. The magnificent tyrants of the past are but the types of those of the future. Men and na tions will always sell themselves into slavery, to gratify their passions and obtain revenge. The tyrant's plea, necessity, is always available; and the tyrant once in power, th e necessity of providing for his safety makes him savage. Religion is a power, and he must control t hat. Independent, its sanctuaries might rebel. Then it becomes unlawful for the people to worship God in their own way, and the old spiritual despotisms revive. Men must believe as Power wills, or die; and even if they may believe as they w ill, all they have, land s, houses, body, and s oul, are stamped with the royal brand. \"I am the State,\" said Louis the Fourteenth to his peasants; \"the very shirts on your backs are mine, and I can take them if I will.\" And dynasties so established endure, like that of the Caesars of Rome , of the Caesars of Constantinople, of the Caliphs, the Stuarts, the Spaniards, the Goths, the Valois, until the race wears out, and ends with lunatics and idiots, who still rule. There is no concord among men, to end the horrible bondage. The State falls inwardly, as well as by the outward blows of the incoherent elements . The furious human passions, the sleeping human indolence, the stolid human ignorance, the rivalry of human castes, are as good for the kirlgs as the swords of the Paladins . The worshippers have all bowed so long to the old idol, that they cannot go into the streets and choose another Grand Llama. And so the effete State floats on down the puddled stream of Time, until the tempest or the tidal sea discovers that the worm has cons umed its strength, and it crumbles into oblivion. * * * * * * Civil and religious Freedom must go hand in hand; and Persecution matures them both. A people content with the t houghts made for them by the priests of a church will be content with Royalty by Divine Right,-- the C hurch and the Throne mutually sustaining each other. They will smother sc hism and reap infi delity and indifferenc e; and while the battle for freedom goes on aroun d them, they will only sink th e more apathetically into servitude and a deep trance, perhaps occasionally interrupted by furious fits of frenzy, followed by helpless exhaustion. Despotism is not dimcult in any land that has only known one master from its childhood; but there is no harder problem than to perfect and perpetuate free government by the people themselves; for it is not one king that is needed: all must be kings. It is easy to set up Masaniello, that in a few days he may fall lower than before. But free govermnent grows slowly, like the individual human facultie s; and like the forest-trees, from the inner heart outward. Liberty is not only the common bi rth-right, but it is lost as well by non-user as by mis-user. It depends far more on t he universal effort than any other human property. It has no single shrine or holy well of pilgrimage for the nation; for its waters should burst out freely from the whole soil. The free popular power is one that is only k nown in its strength in the hour of adversity: for all its trials, sacrifices and expectations are its own. It is trained to think for itself, and also to act for itself. When the enslaved peo ple prostrate themselves in the dust before the hurricane, like the alarmed beasts of the fi eld, the free people stand erect before it, in all the strength of unity, in self-reliance, in mutual reliance, with effrontery against all but the visible hand of God. It is neither cast down by calamity nor elated by success. This vast power of endurance, of forbearance, of patience, and of performance, is only acquired by continual exercise of all the functions, like the healt hful physical human vigor, like the individual moral vigor."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" And the maxim is no less true than old, that et ernal vigilance is the price of liberty. It is curious to observe the universal pretext by wh ich the tyrants of all times take away the national liberties. It is stated in the statutes of Edward II., that the justices and the sheriff should no longer be elected by the people, on account of the riot s and dissensions which had arisen. The same reason was given long before for the suppr ession of popular election of the bishops; and there is a witness to this untruth in the yet older times, when Rome lost her freedom, and her indignant citi zens declared that tumultuous liberty is better than disgra ceful tranquillity. * * * * * * With the Compasses and Scale, we can trace all the figures used in the mathematics of planes, or in what are called GEOMETRY and TRIGONOMETRY, two words that are themselves deficient in meaning. GEOMETRY, wh ich the letter G. in most Lodges is said to signify, means measurement of land or the earth--or Surveying; and TRIGONOMETRY, the measurement of triangles, or figures with three sides or angles. The latter is by far the most appropriate nam e for the science intended to be expressed by the word \"Geometry.\" Neither is of a mean ing sufficiently wide: for although the vast surveys of great spaces of the earth's surf ace, and of coasts, by which shipwreck and calamity to mariners are avoi ded, are effected by means of tr iangulation;--though it was by the same method that the French astro nomers measured a degree of latitude and so established a scale of measures on an immuta ble basis; though it is by means of the immense triangle that has for its base a line drawn in imagination between the place of the earth now and its place six months hence in space, and for its apex a planet or star, that the distance of Jupiter or Sirius from the earth is ascertained; and though there is a triangle still more vast, its bas e extending eit her way from us, with and past the horizon into immensity, and its apex infinitely dist ant above us; to which corresponds a similar infinite triangle belo w--what is above equ alling what is below, immensity equalling immensity; yet the Science of Numbers, to which Pythagoras attached so much importance, and whose mysteries are found everywhere in the ancient religions, and most of all in the Kabalah and in the Bib]e, is not sufficiently expressed by either the word \"Geometry\" or the word \"Trigonometry.\" For th at science includes theseJ with Arithmetic, and also with Algebra, Logarithms, the Inte gral and Differential Calculus; and by means of it are worked out the great problems of Astronomy or the Laws of the Stars. * * * * * * Virtue is but heroic bravery, to do the thing t hought to be true, in spite of all enemies of flesh or spirit, in despite of all temptati ons or menaces. Man is accountable for the uprightness of his doctrine, but not for the rightness of it. Dev out enthusiasm is far easier than a good action. The end of thought is action ; the sole purpose of Religion is an Ethic. Theory, in political science, is worthless, except for the purpose of being realized in practice. In every credo, religious or political as in the soul of man, there are two regions, the Dialectic and the Ethic; and it is only when the two are harmoniously blended, that a perfect discipline is evolved. There are men wh o dialectically are Christians, as there are a multitude who dialectically ar e Masons, and yet who are ethi cally Infidels, as these are ethically of the Profane, in the strictest sense:--intellectual be lievers, but practical atheists:-- men who will write you \"Evidences,\" in perfect faith in thei r logic, but cannot carry out the Christian or Masonic doctrine, owing to the strength, or weakness, of the flesh. On the other hand, there are many di alectical skeptics, but ethical believers, as there are many Masons who have never underg one initiation; and as ethics are the end and purpose of religion, so are ethical belie vers the most worthy. He who does right is better than he who thinks right."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"But you must not act upon the hypothesis t hat all men are hypocrites, whose conduct does not square with their sentim ents. No vice is more rare, for no task is more difficult, than systematic hypocrisy. When the Dem agogue becomes a Usurper it does not follow that he was all the time a hypocrite. Shallow men only so judge of others. The truth is, that creed has, in general, very little influence on the conduct; in religion, on that of the individual; in poli tics, on that of party. As a g eneral thing, the Mahometan, in the Orient, is far more honest and trustworthy than the Christian. A Gospel of Love in the mouth, is an Avatar of Pers ecution in the heart. Men who believe in eternal damnation and a literal sea of fire and brimstone, incur th e certainty of it, according to their creed, on the slightest temptation of appetite or passi on. Predestination insist s on the necessity of good works. In Masonry, at the least flow of passion, one speaks ill of another behind his back; and so far from the \"Brotherhood\" of Blue Masonry being real, and the solemn pledges contained in the use of the word \"Brother\" being complied with, extraordinary pains are taken to show that.Mas onry is a sort of abstraction, which scorns to interfere in worldly matters. The rule may be regarded as universal, that, where there is a choice to be made, a Mason will give his vote and influence, in politi cs and business, to the less qualified profane in pr eference to the better qualified Mason. One will take an oath to oppose any unlawful usurpation of power, and then become the ready and even eager instrument of a usurper. Another will call one \"Brother,\" and then play toward him the part of Judas Iscariot, or strike him, as Joab di d Abner, under the fifth rib, with a lie whose authorship is not to be traced. Masonry does not change human nature, and cannot make honest men out of born knaves. While you are still engaged in prep aration, and in accumulating principles for future use, do not forget the words of the Apostle James: \"For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass, for he beholdeth himself, and goeth away, and straightway forgetteth what ma1lner of man he was; but whoso looketh into the perfect law of libert y, and continueth, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man sh all be blessed in his work. If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.... Faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being an abstraction. A man is justified by works, and not by faith only.... The devils believe,--and tremble.... As the body without the heart is dead, so is faith without works.\" * * * * * * In political science, also, free governments are erected and free constitutions framed, upon some simple a nd intelligible theory. Upon what ever theory they are based, no sound conclusion is to be reached except by carrying the theory out without flinching, both in argumcnt on constitutional qucstions and in practice. Shrink from the true theory through timidity, or wander from it througll want of the logical faculty, or transgress against it througll passion or on the plea of necessity or expediency, and you have denial or invasion of rights, laws that offend agains t first principles, usur pation of illegal powers, or abnegation and abdication of legitimate authority. Do not forget, either, that as the showy, superficial, im pudent and self-c onceited will almost always be preferred, even in utmost st ress of danger and calamity of the State, to the man of solid learning, large intellect, and catholic sympathies, because he is nearer the common popular and legislative level, so the highest truth is no t acceptable to the mass of mankind. When SOLON was asked if he had given hi s countrymen the best laws, he answered, \"The best they are capable of receiving.\" This is one of the profoundest utterances on record; and yet like all great truths, so simple as to be rarely comprehended. It contains the whole philosophy of History. It utters a truth which, had it been recognized, would have saved men an immensity of vain, idle di sputes, and have led them into the clearer paths of knowledge in the Past. It means this,--that all truths are Truths of Period, and"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"not truths for eternity; that whatever great fact has had strength and vitality enough to make itself real, whether of re ligion, morals, government, or of whatever else, and to find place in this world, has been a truth for t he time, and as good as men were capable of receiving. So, too, with great men. The intellect and capacity of a people has a single measure,-- that of the great men whom Providence gi ves it, and whom it receives. There have always been men too great for their time or their people. Every people makes such men only its idols, as it is capable of comprehending. To impose ideal truth or law upon an incapable and merely real man, must ever be a vain and empty speculation. The laws of sympathy govern in this as they do in regard to men who are put at the head. We do not know, as yet, what qualifications the sheep insist on in a leader. With men who are too high intellect ually, the mass have as little sympathy as they have with the stars. When BURKE, the wi sest statesman England ever had, rose to speak, the House of Commons was depopulated as upon an agreed signal. There is as little sympathy between the mass and th e highest TRUTHS. The highest truth, being incomprehensible to the man of realities, as the highest man is, and largely above his level, will be a great unreality and falsehood to an unintellectual man. The profoundest doctrines of Christianity and Philosophy would be mere jargon and babble to a Potawatomie Indian. The popular explanations of the symbols of Ma sonry are fitting for the multitude that have swarmed into the Temp les,--being fully up to the level of their capacity. Catholicism was a vital truth in its earliest ages, but it became obsolete, and Protestantism arose, flouris hed, and deteriorated. The doctrines of ZOROASTER were the best which the ancient Persians were fi tted to receive; those of CONFUCIUS were fitted for the Chinese; those of MOHAMMED for the idolatrous Arabs of his age. Each was Truth for the time. Each was a GOSPEL, preached by a REFORMER; and if any men are so little fortunate as to remain cont ent therewith, when others have attained a higher truth, it is their misf ortune and not their fault. They are to be pitied for it, and not persecuted. Do not expect easily to convince men of the truth, or to lead them to think aright. The subtle human intellect can weave its mists ov er even the clearest vi sion. Remember that it is eccentric enough to ask unanimity from a jury; but to ask it from any large number of men on any point of political faith is am azing. You can hardly get two men in any Congress or Convention to agree;--nay, you c an rarely get one to agree with himself. The political church which chances to be supr eme anywhere has an indefinite number of tongues. How then can we expect men to ag ree as to matters beyond the cognizance of the senses? How can we compass the Infini tc and the Invisible with any chain of evidence? Ask the small sea-waves what they murmur among the pebbles ! How many of those words that come from the invisibl e shore are lost, like the birds, in the long passage ? How vainly do we strain the eyes across the long Infinite ! We must be content, as the children are, with the pe bbles that have been st randed, since it is forbidden us to explore the hidden depths. The Fellow-Craft is especially taught by this not to become wise in his own conceit. Pride in unsound theories is wors e than ignorancc. Humility be comes a Mason. Take some quiet, sober moment of life, and add together the two ideas of Pride and Man; behold him, creature of a span, stalking through infi nite space in all the grandeur of littleness ! Perched on a speck of the Universe, every wind of Heaven strikes into his blood the coldness of death; his soul fl oats avvay from his body like the melody from the string. Day and night, like dust on the wheel, he is rolled along the heavens, through a labyrinth of worlds, and all the creations of God ar e flanling on every side, further than even his imagination can reach. Is this a creature to ma ke for himself a crown of glory, to deny his own flesh, to mock at his fe llow, sprung with him from that dust to which both will soon return? Does the proud man not err? Does he not suffer? Does he not die? When he reasons, is he never stopped short by difficulties ? When he acts, does he never succumb to the temptations of pleasure? When he lives, is he free from pain? Do the diseases not claim him as their prey? When he dies, can he escape the common grave ?"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Pride is not the heritage of man. Humilit y should dwell with fr ailty, and atone for ignorance, error and imperfection. Neither should the Mason be ov er-anxious for office and honor, however certainly he rmay feel that he has the capacity to serve the State. He should neither seek nor spurn honors. It is good to enjoy the blessings of fo rtune; it is better to submit without a pang to their loss. The greatest deeds are not done in the glare of light, and before the eyes of the populace. He whom God has gifted with a love of retirement possesses, as it were, an additional sense; and among the vast and noble scenes of nature, w e find the balm for the wounds we have received among the pitifu l shifts of policy; fo r the attachment to solitude is the surest preserva tive from the ills of life. But Resignation is the more noble in proporti on as it is the less passive. Retirement is only a morbid selfishness, if it prohibit exer tions for others; as it is only dignified and noble, when it is the shade whence the oracle s issue that are to instruct mankind; and retirement of this nature is the sole seclusion which a good and wise man will covet or command. The very philosophy which makes such a man covet the quiet, will make him eschew the inutility of th e hermitage. Very little pr aiseworthy would LORD BOLINGBROKE have seemed among his haymakers and ploughmen, if among haymakers and ploughmen he had looked with an indifferent ey e upon a profligate minister and a venal Parliament. Very little inte rest would have attached to his beans and vetches, if beans and vetches had caused him to forget that if he vvas happier on a fann he could be more useful in a Senate, and made hi m forego, in the sphere of a bailiff, all care for re-entering that of a legislator. Remember, also, that therc is an education which quickens the Intellect, and leaves the heart hollower or harder than before. There are ethical lessons in the laws of the heavenly bodies, in the properties of earthly elements, in geography, chemistry, geology, and all the material sciences. Things are symbols of Truths. Properties are symbols of Truths. Science, not te aching moral and spiritual truths, is dead and dry, of little more real value than to commit to the menlory a long row of unconnected dates, or of the names of bugs or butterflies. Christianity, it is said, begins from the burning of the false gods by the people themselves. Education begins with the burning of our intellectual and moral idols: our prejudices, notions, conceits, our worth]es s or ignoble purposes. Especially it is necessary to shake off the love of worldl y gain. With Freedom comes the longing for worldly advancement. In that race men are ever falling, risi ng, running , and falling again. The lust for wealth and the abject dread of poverty delve the furrows on many a noble brow. The gambler grows old as he watches the chances. Lawful hazard drives Youth away before its time; and this Youth draws h eavy bills of exchange on Age. Men live, like the engines, at high pressure, a hundred ye ars in a hundred months; the ledger becomes the Bible, and the day-book the Book of the Morning Prayer. Hence flow overreachings and sharp practice, heartless traffic in which the capitalist buys profit with the lives of the l aborers, speculations th at coin a nation's agonies into wealth, and all the other devilish cngi nery of Mammon. This, and gr eed for office, are the two columns at the entrance to the Temple of Moloch. It is doubtful whether the latter, blossoming in falsehood, trickery, and fraud, is not even more perni cious than the former. At all events they are twins, an d fitly mated; and as either ga ins control of the unfortunate subject, his soul withers away and decays, an d at last dies out. The souls of half the human race leave them long before they di e. The two greeds are twin plagues of the leprosy, and make the man unclean; and whenev er they break out they spread until \"they cover all the skin of him that hath the pla gue, from his head even to his foot.\" Even the raw flesh of the heart becomes unclean with it. Alexander of Macedon has left a saying behi nd him which has survived his conquests: \"Nothing is nobler than work.\" Work only c an keep even kings respectable. And when a"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"king is a king indeed, it is an honorable office to give tone to the manners and morals of a nation; to set the example of virtuous conduc t, and restore in spirit the old schools of chivalry, in which the young manhood may be nurtured to real greatness. Work and wages will go together in men's minds, in the mo st royal institutions. We must ever come to the idea of real work. The rest that follo ws labor should be sweeter than the rest which follows rest. Let no Fellow-Craft imagine that the work of the lowly and uninfluential is not worth the doing. There is no legal limit to the possible influences of a good deed or a wise word or a generous effort. Nothing is really small. Whoever is open to the deep penetration of nature knows this. Although, indeed, no absolute satisfaction may be vouchsafed to philosophy, any more in circ umscribing the cause than in limiting the effect, the man of thought and contemplation falls into unfa thomable ecstacies in view of all the decompositions of forces resulting in uni ty. All works for all. Destruction is not annihilation, but regeneration. Algebra applies to the clouds; the radiance of the star benefits the rose; no thinker would dare to say that the perfume of the hawthorn is useless to the constellations. Who, then, can calculate the path of the molecule? How do we know that the creations of worlds are not determined by the fall of grains of sand ? Who, then, understands the reciprocal flow and ebb of the inrlnitely great and the infini tely small; the echoing of causes in the abysses of beginning, and the avalanches of creation? A fl eshworm is of account; the small is great; the great is small; all is in equilibrium in necessity . There are marvellous relations between beings and things; in this inexhaustible Whole, from sun to grub, there is no scorn: all need each other. Light does not carry terrestrial perfumes into the azure depths, without knowing what it does with them; night distribu tes the stellar essence to the sleeping plants.

There is the same and a still mo re wonderful inter penetration between the things of the intellect and the things of matter. Elements and principles are mingled, combined, espoused, multiplied one by another to such a degree as to bring the material world and the moral world into the same light. Phenomena are perpetually folded back upon themselves. In the vast cosmical changes t he universal life comes and goes in unknown quantities, enveloping all in t he invisible mystery of the eman ations, losing no dream from no single sleep, sowing an animalcule he re, crumbling a star there, oscillating and winding in curves; making a force of Light, and an element of Thought; disseminated and indivisible, dissolving all save that point without length, breadth, or thickness, The MYSEF; reducing everything to the Soul-ato m ; making everything blossom into God; entangling all activities, from the higllest to the lowest, in the obscurity of a dizzying mechanism; hanging the flight of an inse ct upon the movement of the earth; subordinating, perhaps, if only by the identity of the law, t he eccentric evolutions of the comet in the firmament, to the whirlings of the infusoria in th e drop of water. A mechanism made of mind, the first motor of which is the gnat, and its last wheel the zodiac. A peasant-boy, guiding Blucher by the right one of two roads , the other being impassable for artillery, enables him to reach Waterloo in time to save Wellingt on from a defeat that would have been a rout; and so enables the kings to imprison Napoleon on a barren rock in mid-ocean. An unfaithful smith, by th e slovenly shoeing of a horse, causes his lameness, and, he stumbling, the career of his world-conquering rider ends, and the destinies of empires are changed. A generous officer permits an imprisoned monarch to end his game of chess before leading him to the block; and meanwhile the usurper dies, and the prisoner reascends the thro ne. An unskillful workman repairs the compass, or malice or stupidity di sarranges it, the ship mistakes her course, the waves swallow a Caesar, and a new chapter is written in the hi story of a world.

A civ il war in America will end in shaking the world; and that war may be caused by the vote of some ignorant prize-fighter or crazed fanatic in a city or in a Congress, or of some st upid boor in an obscure country parish. The electricity of universal sympathy, of action and reaction, pervades ev erything, the planets and the motes in the sunbeam. FAUST, with his types, or LUTHER, with his sermons, worked greater results than Alexander or Hanni bal. A single thought sometimes suffices to overturn a dynasty. A silly song did more to unseat James the Second than the acquittal of the Bishops. Volt aire, Condorcet, and Rousseau u ttered words that will ring, in change and revolutions, throughout all the ages. Remember, that though life is short, Thought and the influences of what we do or say are immortal; and that no calculus has yet pretended to ascertain the law of proportion between cause and effect. The hammer of an English blacksmith, smiting down an insolent official, led to a rebellion which came near being a revolution. The word well spoken, the deed fitly done, even by the feeble st or humblest, cannot help but have their effect. More or less, the effect is inevitable and eternal. The echoes of the greatest deeds may die away like the echoes of a cry among the cliffs, and what has been done seem to the human judgment to have been without result. The unconsidered act of the poorest of men may fire the train that leads to the subt erranean mine, and an empire be rent by the explosion. The power of a free people is often at th e disposal of a singl e and seemingly an unimportant individual;--a terrible and truthful power; for such a people feel with one heart, and therefore can lift up their myriad ar ms for a single blow. And, again, there is no graduated scale for the measurement of the influences of different intellects upon the popular mind. Peter the Hermit held no office, yet what a work he wrought ! * * * * * * From the political point of view there is bu t a single principle,-- the sovereignty of man over himself. This sovereignty of one's self over one's self is called LIBERTY. Where two or several of these sovereignties associate, th e State begins. But in this association there is no abdication. Each sovereignty parts wit h a certain portion of itself to form the common right. That portion is the same for a ll. There is equal contribution by all to the joint sovereignty. This identity of concessi on which each makes to all, is EQUALITY. The common right is nothing more or less than the protection of all, pouring its rays on each. This protection of each by all, is FRATERNITY. Liberty is the summit, Equality the base. Equalit y is not all vegetation on a level, a society of big spears of grass and stunted oaks, a neighborhood of jealousies, emasculatillg each other. It is, civilly, all aptitudes having equal opportunity; politically, all votes having equal weight; religiously, all consciences having equal rights. Equality has an organ;--gratuitous and obligatory instruction. We must begin with the right to the alphabet. The primary school obli gatory upon all; the higher school offered to all. Such is the law. From the same school for all springs equal society. Instruction ! Light ! all comes from Light, and all returns to it. We must learn the thoughts of the common peo ple, if we would be wise and do any good work. We must look at men, not so much for what Fortune has given to them with her blind old eyes, as for the gifts Nature has br ought in her lap, and for the use that has been made of them. We profess to be equal in a Church and in the Lodge: we shall be equal in the sight of God when He judges the earth. We may well sit on the pavement"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"together here, in communion and conference, for the few brief moments that constitute life. A Democratic Government undoubtedly has its defects, because it is made and administered by men, and not by the Wise Gods. It cannot be concise and sharp, like the despotic. When its ire is aroused it develops its latent str ength, and the sturdiest rebel trembles. But its habitual domestic rule is tolerant, patient, and indecisive. Men are brought together, first to differ, and then to agree. Affirmation, negation, discussion, solution: these are the means of attaining truth. Often the enemy will be at the gates before the babble of the disturbers is drowned in the chorus of consen t. In the Legislative office deliberation will often defeat decision. Liberty can play the fool like the Tyrants Refined society requires greater minuteness of regulation; and the steps of all advancing States are more and more to be picked am ong the old rubbish and the new matcrials. The difficulty lies in discovering the right path through the chaos of confusion. The adjustment of mutual rights and wrongs is also more difficult in democracies. We do not see and estimate the relative importance of obj ects so easily and clearly from the level or the waving iand as from the elevation of a lone peak, towering above the plain; for each looks through his own mist. Abject dependence on constituents, also, is to o common. It is as miserable a thing as abject dependence on a minister or the favorite of a Tyrant. It is rare to find a man who can speak out the simple truth that is in him, honestly and frankly, without fear, favor, or affection, either to Emperor or People. Moreover, in assemblies of men, faith in eac h other is almost alwa ys wanting, unless a terrible pressure of calamity or danger from without produces cohesion. Hence the constructive power of such assemblies is generally deficient. The chief triumphs of modern days, in Europe , have been in pulling down and oblit erating; not in building up. But Repeal is not Reform. Time must br ing with him the Restorer and Rebuilder. Speech, also, is grossly abused in Republics; and if the use of speech be glorious, its abuse is the most villainous of vices. Rhetoric , Plato says, is the art of ruling the minds of men. But in democracies it is too common to hide thought in words,to overlay it, to babble nonsense. The gleams and glitter of intellectual soap-and-water bubbles are mistaken for the rainbow-glories of genius. Th e worthless pyrites is continually mistaken for gold. Even intellect cond escends to intellectual juggle ry, balancing thoughts as a juggler balances pipes on his chin. In all C ongresses we have the i nexhaustible flow of babble, and Faction's clamorous knavery in di scussion, until the divine power of speech, that privilege of man and great gift of God, is no better than the screech of parrots or the mimicry of monkeys. The mere talker, however fluent, is barren of deeds in the day of trial. There are men voluble as women, and as well skilled in fencing with the tongue: prodigies of speech, misers in deeds. Too much calking, like too much thinking, destroys the power of action. In human nature, the th ought is only made perf ect by deed. Silence is the mother of both. The trumpeter is not the bravest of the brave. Steel and not brass wins the day. The great doer of great deeds is mostly slow and slovenly of speech. There are some men born and brcd to betray. Patriotism is their trade, and their capital is speech. But no noble spirit can plead like Paul and be false to itself as Judas. Imposture too commonly rules in republics; they seem to be ever in their minority; their guardians are self-appointed; and tlhe unjust th rive better than the just. The Despot, like the night-lion roaring, drowns all the clamor of tongues at once, and speech, the birthright of the free man, becomes the bauble of the enslaved. It is quite true that republics only occasionally , and as it were accidentally, select their wisest, or even the less incapable among th e incapables, to govern them and legislate"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"for them. If genius, armed with learning and knowledge, will grasp the reins, the people will reverence it; if it only modest ly offers itself for office, it will be smitten on the face, even when, in the straits of di stress and the agonies of calamity , it is indispensable to the salvation of the State. Put it upon the track with the showy and superfic ial, the conceited, the ignorant, and impudent, the trickster and charlatan, and the result shall not be a moment doubtful. The verdicts of Legislatures and the People are like the verdicts of juries,--sometimes right by accident. Offices, it is true, are showered, like the ra ins of Heaven, upon the just and the unjust. The Roman Augurs that used to laugh in each ot her's faces at the simp licity of the vulgar, were also tickled with their own guile; but no Augur is needed to lead the people astray. They readily deceive themselves. Let a Republic begin as it may, it will not be out of its minority before imbecility will be promoted to hi gh places; and shallow pretence, getting itself puffed into notice, will invade all the sanctuaries. T he most unscrupulous partisanship will prevail, even in respect to judicial trusts; a nd the most unjust appointments constantly be made, altho ugh every improper promotion not merely confers one undeserved favor, but may make a hundred honest cheeks smart with injustice. The country is stabbed in the front when those are brought into the stalled seats who should slink into the dim gallery. Every stam p of Honor, ill-clutched, is stolen from the Treasury of Merit. Yet the entrance into the public service, and the promotion in it, affect both the rights of individuals and those of the nation. Injustice in bestowing or withholding office ought to be so intolerable in democratic communities t hat the least trace of it should be like the scent of Treason. It is not universally true that all citizens of equal character have an equal claim to knock at the door of every public office and demand admittance. When any man presents himself for service he has a ri ght to aspire to the highest body at once, if he can show his fitness for such a beginning,--that he is fitter than the rest who offer themselves for the same post. The entry into it can only justly be made through the door of merit. And whenever any one aspires to a nd attains such high post, especially if by unfair and disreputable and indecent means, and is afterward found to be a signal failure, he should at once be beheaded. He is the worst among the public enemies. When a man sumciently rev eals himself, all others shou ld be proud to give him due precedence. When the power of promotion is abused in the grand passages of life whether by People, Legislature, or Executiv e, the unjust decision re coils on the judge at once. That is not only a gross, but a willful shortness of sight, that cannot discover the deserving. If one will look hard, long, and honestl y, he will not fail to discern merit, genius, and qualification; and the eyes an d voice of the Press and Public should condemn and denounce injustice wherever she rears her horrid head. \"The tools to the workmen!\" no other principle will save a Republic from destruction, either by civil war or the dry-rot. They tend to decay, do all we can to prevent it, like human bodies. If they try the experiment of governing themselv es by their smallest, they slide downward to the unavoidable abyss with tenfold velocity; and there never has been a Republic that has not followed that fatal course. But however palpable and gross the inherent defects of democratic governments, and fatal as the results finally and inevitably are, we need only glance at the reigns of Tiberius, Nero, and Caligula, of Heli ogabalus and Caracalla, of Domitian and Commodus, to recognize that the difference between freedom and despotism is as wide as that between Heaven and Hell. The cruel ty, baseness, and insanity of tyrants are incredible. Let him who complains of the fickle humors and inconstancy of a free people, read Pliny's character of Do mitian.

Let Masonry use the pen and the printing-pre ss in the free State against the Demagogue; in the Despotism against the Tyrant. History offers examples and encouragement. All history, for four thous and years, being filled with violat ed rights and the sufferings of the people, each period of history brings with it such protest as is possible to it. Under the Caesars there was no insurrection, but there was a Juvenal. The arousing of indignation replaces the Gracchi. Under the Caesars ther e is the exile of Syene; there is also the author of the Annals. As the Neros reign darkl y they should be pictured so. Work with the graver only would be pale; into the grooves should be poured a concentrated prose that bites. Despots are an aid to thinkers. Speech enchai ned is speech terrible. The writer doubles and triples his style, when silence is imposed by a master upon the people. There springs from this silence a certain mysterio us fullness, which filters and freezes into brass in the thoughts. Compression in the hist ory produces conciseness in the historian. The granitic solidity of some celebrated pros e is only a condensation produced by the Tyrant. Tyranny constrains the writer to shor tenings of diameter wh ich are increases of strength. The Ciceronian period, hardly sumc ient upon Verres, would lose its edge upon Caligula. The Demagogue is the predecessor of the Desp ot. One springs from the other's loins. He who will basely fawn on those who have office to bestow, will betray like Iscariot, and prove a miserable and pitiable failure. Let the new Junius lash such men as they deserve, and History make them immortal in infamy; since their influences culminate in ruin. The Republic that employs and honors the shallow, the superficial, the base, \"who crouch Unto the offal of an office promised,\" at last weeps tears of blood fo r its fatal error. Of such su preme folly, the sure fruit is damnation. Let the nobility of every great heart, c ondensed into justice and truth, strike such creatures like a thunderbolt ! If you can do no more, you can at least condemn by your vote, and ostracise by denunciation. It is true that, as the Czars ar e absolute, they have it in their power to select the best for the public service. It is true that the beginn er of a dynasty generally does so; and that when monarchies are in their prime, pretenc e and shallowness do not thrive and prosper and get power, as they do in Republics. All do not gabble in the Parliament of a Kingdom, as in the Congress of a Democracy. The inc apables do not go undetected there, all their lives. But dynasties speedily decay and run out. At last they dwindle down into imbecility; and the dull or flippant Members of Congresses are at least the intellectual peers of the vast majority of kings. The great man, the Ju lius Caesar, the Charlemagne, Cromwell, Napoleon, reigns of right. He is the wis est and the strongest. The incapables and imbeciles succeed and are usurpers; and fear makes them cruel. After Julius came Caracalla and Galba; after Charlemagne, the lunatic Charles the Sixt h. So the Saracenic dynasty dwindled out; the Capets, the Stuarts, the Bourbc1ns; the last of these producing Bomba, the ape of Domitian. Man is by nature cruel, like the tigers.

Let him who complains of the shortcomings of democracy ask himself if he would prefer a Du Barry or a Pompadour, gover ning in the name of a Louis the Fifteenth, a Caligula making his horse a consul, a Domi tian, \"that most savage monster,\" who sometimes drank the blood of relatives, so metimes employing himself with slaughtering the most distinguished citizens before whose gates fear and terr or kept watch; a tyrant of frightful aspect, pride on his forehead, fire in his eye, constantly seeking darkness and secrecy, and only emerging from his solitud e to make solitude.

What is the exclusion of worth and intellect and kn owledge from civil office compared with trials before Jeffries, tortures in the dark cavern s of the Inquisition, Alvabutcheries in the Netherlands, the Eve of Saint Bartholomew, a nd the Sicilian Vespers? * * * * * * The Abbe Barruel in his Memoirs for the Histor y of Jacobinism, declares that Masonry in France gave, as its secret, the words Equality and Liberty, leaving it for every honest and religious Mason to explain them as would be st suit his principles; but retained the privilege of unveiling in the hi gher Degrees the meaning of those words, as interpreted by the French Revolution. And he also excepts English Masons from his anathemas, because in England a Mason is a peaceable subject of the civil authorities, no matter where he resides, engaging in no plots or conspiracies against even the worst government. England, he says, disgust ed with an Equality and a Liberty, the consequences of which she had felt in the struggles of her Lollards, Anabaptists, and Presbyterians, had \"purged her Masonry\" fr om all explanations tending to overturn empires; but there still rema ined adepts whom disorganizin g principles bound to the Ancient Mysteries. Because true Masonry, unemasculated, bore the banners of Freedom and Equal Rights, and was in rebellion against tem poral and spiritual tyranny, it s Lodges were proscribed in 1735, by an edict of the States of Holland. In 1737, Louis XV. forbade them in France. In 1738, Pope Clement XII. issued against them his famous Bull of Excommunication, which was renewed by Benedict XIV.; and in 1743 the Council of Berne also proscribed them. The title of the Rull of Clement is, \"The Condemnation of the Society of Conventicles de Liberi Muratori, or of the Freemasons, under the penalty of ipso facto excommunication, the absolution from which is reserved to the Pope alone, except at the point of death.\" And by it all bishops, or dinaries, and inquisitors were empowered to punish Freemasons, \"as vehemently suspected of heresy,\" and to call in, if necessary, the help of the secular arm; that is, to caus e the civil authority to put them to death. * * * * * * Also, false and slavish political theories end in brutalizing the Stat e. For example, adopt the theory that offices and employments in it are to be given as rewards for services rendered to party, and they soon become the pr ey and spoil of factio n, the booty of the victory of faction;--and leprosy is in the fles h of the State. The body of the commonwealth becomes a mass of corruption, like a livi ng carcass rotten with syphilis. All unsound theories in the end develop themselves in one foul and loathsome dise ase or other of the body politic.

A nation cannot renounce the executor ship of the Divine decrees. As little can Masonry. It must labor to do its duty knowingly and wisely. We must remember that, in free States, as well as in despotisms, Injustice, the spouse of Oppression, is the fruitful parent of Dece it, Distrust, Hatred, Co nspiracy, Treason, and Unfaithfulness. Even in assailing Tyranny we must have Truth and Reason as our chief weapons. We must march into that fight like t he old Puritans, or into the battle with the abuses that spring up in free government, wi th the flaming sword in one hand, and the Oracles of God in the other. The citizen who cannot accomplish well the smaller purposes of public life, cannot compass the larger. The vast power of endurance, forbearance, patience, and performance, of a free people, is acquired only by continual exercise of all the functions, like the healthful physical human vigor. If t he individual citizens have it not, the State must equally be without it. It is of the es sence of a free govern ment, that the people should not only be concerned in making the la ws, but also in their execution. No man ought to be more ready to obey and administer the law than he who has helped to make it. The business of government is carried on for the benefit of all, and every co-partner should give counsel and cooperation. Remember also, as another shoal on which Stat es are wrecked, that free States always tend toward the depositing of the citizens in strata, the creation of castes, the perpetuation of the jus divinurn to office in families. The more democratic the State, the more sure this result. For, as free States advance in power, there is a strong tendency toward centralization, not from deliberate evil intention, but from the course of events and the indolence of human nature. The execut ive powers swell and enlarge to inordinate dimensions; and the Executive is always aggressive with respec t to the nation. Offices of all kinds are multiplied to reward partisans; the brute force of the sewerage and lower strata of the mob obtains large representation, first in the lower offices, and at last in Senates; and Bureaucracy ra ises its bald head, bristl ing with pens, girded with spectacles, and bunched with ribbon. The art of Government becomes like a Craft, and its guilds tend to become exclusive, as those of the Middle Ages. Political science may be much improved as a su bject of speculation; but it should never be divorced from the actual national nece ssity. The science of governing men must always be practical, rather th an philosophical. There is not t he same amount of positive or universal truth here as in the abstract sc iences; what is true in one country may be very false in another; what is untrue to-day may become true in another generation, and the truth of to-day be reversed by the judgm ent of to-morrow. To distinguish the casual from the enduring, to separat e the unsuitable from the suitable, and to make progress even possible, are the proper ends of po licy. But without act ual knowledge and experience, and communion of labor, the dreams of the political doctors may be no better than those of the doctors of divinity. The re ign of such a caste, with its mysteries, its myrmidons, and its corrupting influence, may be as fatal as that of the despots. Thirty tyrants are thirty times worse than one. Moreover, there is a strong temptation fo r the governing people to become as much slothful and sluggards as the weakest of absolute ki ngs. Only give them the power to get rid, when caprice prompts them, of the great and wise men, and elect the little, and as to all the rest they will relapse into indolence and indifference. The central power, creation of the people, organized and c unning if not enlightened, is th e perpetual tribunal set up by them for the redress of wrong and the rule of justice. It soon supplies itself with all the requisite machinery, and is ready and apt for all kinds of interference. The people may be a child all its life. The central power ma y not be able to suggest the best scientific solution of a problem; but it has the easiest means of carrying an id ea into effect. If the purpose to be attained is a large one, it requi res a large comprehension; it is proper for the action of the central power. If it be a small one, it may be thwarted by disagreement. The central power must step in as an arbitr ator and prevent this.

Men are thus nurtured in imbecility, from the dawn of so cial life. When the central government feeds part of the people it prepares all to be slaves. When it directs parish and county affairs, they are slaves already. The next step is to regulate labor and its wages.

FAITH is the Saviour and Redeemer of nations. When Christianity had grown weak, profitless, and powerless, the Arab Restorer and Iconoclast came, like a cleansing hurricane. When the battle of Damascus was about to be fought, the Christi an bishop, at the early dawn, in his robes, at the head of his clergy, witll trle Cross once so triumphant raised in the air, came down to the gates of the city, and laid open bef ore the army the Testament of Christ. The Christian general, THOMAS, laid his hand on the book, and said, \"Oh God ! If our faith be true, aid us, and deliver us not into the han ds of its enemies!\" But KHALED, \"the Sword of God,\" who had marched from victory to vict ory, exclaimed to his wearied soldiers, \"Let no man sleep! There will be rest enough in the bowers of Paradise; sweet will be the repose never more to be followed by labor.\" The faith of the Arab had become stronger than that of the Christian, and he conquered. The Sword is also, in the Bi ble, an emblem of SPEECH, or of the utteranc e of thought. Thus, in that vision or apocalypse of the sublime exile of Patmos, a protest in the name of the ideal, overwhelming the real world, a tremendous satire uttered in the name of Religion and Liberty, and with its fiery reverb erations smiting the throne of the Gesars, a sharp two-edged sword comes out of the mouth of the Semblance of the Son of Man, encircled by the seven golden candlesticks, and holding in his right hand seven stars. \"The Lord,\" says Isaiah, \"hath made my mouth like a sharp sword.\" \"I have slain them,\" says Hosea, \"by th e words of my mouth.\" \"The word of God,\" says the writer of the apostolic letter to the Hebrew s, \"is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit.\" \"The sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God,\" says Paul, writing to the Christians at Ephesus. \"I will fight against them with the sword of my mouth,\" it is said in the Apocalypse, to the angel of the church at Pergamos. * * * * * * The spoken discourse may roll on strongly as th e great tidal wave; but, like the wave, it dies at last feebly on the sa nds. It is heard by few, reme mbered by still fewer, and fades away, like an echo in the mountains, leaving no token of power. It is nothing to tlle living and coming generat ions of men. It was the written hulll an speech, that gave power and permanence to human thought. It is this t hat makes the whole human history but one individual life. To write on the rock is to write on a solid parc hment; but it requires a pilgrimage to see it. There is but one copy, and Time wears even that. To write on skins or papyrus was to give, as it were, but one tardy edition, and the rich only could procure it. The Chinese stereotyped not only the uncha nging wisdom of oid sages, bu t also the passing events. The process tended to suffocate thought, and to hinder progress; for there is continual wandering in the wisest minds, and Truth writes her last words, not on clean tablets, but on the scrawl that Error has made and often mended."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Printing made the movable letters prolific.

It is not this kind of warfare whicll makes the Cross triumphant in the hearts of the unbelievers; but the actual power that lives in the Faith. So there is a political scholast icism that is merely useless. The dexterities of subtle logic rarely stir the hearts of the people, or convince them. T he true apostle of Liberty, Fraternity and Equality makes it a matter of life and death. His combats are like those of Bossuet,-- combats to the death.

Matters of government and political science can be fair ly dealt with only by sound reason, and the logic of common sense: not the common sens e of the ignorant, but of the wise. The acutest thinkers rarely succeed in becoming leaders of men. A watchword or a catchword is more potent with the people than logic, especially if this be the least metaphysical. When a political prophet arises, to stir th e dreaming, stagnant nation, and hold back its feet from the irretrievable descent, to heav e the land as with an earthquake, and shake the silly-shallow idols from their seats, hi s words vvill come stra ight from God's own nlouth, and be thundere d into the conscience. He will r eason, teach, warn, and rule. The real \"Sword of the Spirit\" is keener than t he brightest blade of Damascus. Such men rule a land, in the strength of just ice, with wisdom and with power. Still, t he men of dialectic subtlety often rule well, because in practice t hey forget their finely-spun theories, and use the trenchant logic of common sens e. But when the great heart and large intellect are left to the rust in private life, and small attorneys, brawlers in politics, and those who in the cities would be only the clerks of notaries, or practitioners in the disreputable courts, are made national Legislators, the country is in her dotage. even if the beard has not yet grown upon her chin. In a free country, human speech must needs be free; and the State must listen to the maunderings of folly, and the screechings of it s geese, and the brayi ngs of its asses, as well as to the golden oracles of its wise a nd great men. Even the despotic old kings allowed their wise fools to say what they liked. The true alchelllist will extract the lessons of wisdom from the babblings of folly. He will hear what a man has to say on any given subject, even if the speaker end only in proving himself prin ce of fools. Even a fool will"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"sometimes hit the mark. There is some truth in all men who are not compelled to suppress their souls and speak other men's thoughts. The finger even of the idiot may point to the great highway. A people, as well as the sages, must learn to forget. If it neither learns the new nor forgets the old, it is fated, ev en if it has been royal for thirty generations. To unlearn is to learn; and also it is sometimes needful to le arn again the forgotten. The antics of fools make the current follies more palpable, as fashions are shown to be absurd by caricatures, which so lead to their extirpation. The buffoon and the zany are useful in their places. The ingenious artificer and craf tsman, like Solomon, searches the earth for his materials, and transforms the misshapen matter into glorious workmanship. The world is conquered by the head even more than by the ha nds. Nor will any assembly talk forever. After a time, when it has listened long enough, it quietly puts the silly, the shallow, and the superficial to one side,--it thinks, and sets to work. The human thought, especially in popular a ssemblies, runs in the most singularly crooked channels, harder to trace and follow than the blind currents of the ocean. No notion is so absurd that it may not find a place there. The master-workman must train these notions and vagaries with his two-handed hammer. They twist out of the way of the sword-thrusts; and are invulnerable all over, ev en in the heel, against logic. The martel or mace, the battle-axe, the great double-edged two-h anded sword must deal with follies; the rapier is no better against them than a wand, unless it be the rapier of ridicule. The SWORD is also the symbol of war and of the soldier. Wars, like thunder-storms, are often necessary to purify the stagnant at mosphere. War is not a demon, without remorse or reward. It restores the brotherhood in le tters of fire. When men are seated in their pleasant places, sunken in ease and indol ence, with Pretence and Incapacity and Littleness usurping all the high places of Stat e, war is the baptism of blood and fire, by which alone they can be renovated. It is the hurricane that brings the elemental equilibrium, the concord of Power and Wisdom . So long as these continue obstinately divorced, it will continue to chasten. In the mutual appeal of nations to God, there is the acknowledg ment of His might. It lights the beacons of Faith and Freedom, and heats the furnace through which the earnest and loyal pass to immortal glory. There is in war the doom of defeat, the quenchless sense of Duty, the stirring sense of Honor, the measureless solemn sacrifice of devotedness, and the incense of success. Ev en in the flame and smoke of battle, the Mason discovers his brother, and fulfills the sacred obligations of Fraternity. Two, or the Duad, is the symbol of Antagonis m; of Good and Evil, Light and Darkness. It is Cain and Abel, Eve and Lilith, Jachin an d Boaz, Ormuzd and Ah riman, Osiris and Typhon. THREE, or the Triad, is most significantl y expressed by the equilateral and the right- angled triangles. There are three principal colors or rays in the rainbow, which by intermixture make seven. The three are the bl ue, the yelloW, and the red. The Trinity of the Deity, in one mode or other, has been an ar ticle in all creeds. He creates, preserves, and destroys. He is the generative power, th e productive capacity, and the result. The immaterial man, according to the Kabalah, is composed of vitality, or life, the breath of life; of soul or mind, and spirit. Salt, su lphur, and mercury are the great symbols of the alchemists. To them man was body, soul, and spirit. FOUR is expressed by the square, or four-sid ed right-angled figure. Out of the symbolic Garden of Eden flowed a river, dividing into four streams,--PISON, which flows around the land of gold, or light; GIHON, which flow s around the land of Ethiopia or Darkness; HIDDEKEL, running eastward to Assyria; and the EUPHRATES. Zechariah saw four chariots coming out from between two mountain s of bronze, in the first of which were red horses; in the second, black; in the third, wh ite; and in the fourth, grizzled: \"and these"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"were the four winds of the heavens, that go fo rth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.\" Ezekiel saw the four living creatures, each with four faces and four wings, the faces of a man and a lion, an ox and an eagle ; and the four wheels going upon their four sides; and Saint John beheld t he four beasts, full of eyes before and behind, the LION, the young Ox, the MAN, and the flying EAG LE. Four was the signat ure of the Earth. Therefore, in the 148th Psalm, of those who must praise the Lord on the land, there are four times four, and four in particular of livi ng creatures. Visible natu re is described as the four quarters of the world, and the four corn ers of the earth. \"There are four,\" says the old Jewish saying, \"which take the first place in this world: man, am ong the creatures; the eagle among birds; the ox am ong cattle; and the lion among wild beasts.\" Daniel saw four great beasts come up from the sea. FIVE is the Duad added to the Triad. It is expr essed by the five-pointed or blazing star, the mysterious Pentalpha of Pythagoras. It is indissolubly connected with the number seven. Christ fed His disciples and the multit ude with five loaves and two fishes, and of the fragments there remained twelve, that is, five and seven, baskets full. Again He fed them with seven loaves and a few little fis hes, and there remained seven baskets full. The five apparently small planet s, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, with the two greater ones, the Sun and Moon, c onstituted the seven celestial spheres. SEVEN was the peculiarly sa cred number. There were seven planets and spheres presided over by seven archangels. There were seven colors in the rainbow; and the Phoenician Deity was called the HEPTAKIS or God of seven rays; seven days of the week; and seven and five made the number of months, tribes, ancl apostles. Zechariah saw a golden candlestick, with seven lamps and seven pipes to the lamps, and an olive- tree on each side. Since he says, \"the seven ey es of the Lord shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel.\" John , in the Apocalypse, writes seven epistles to the seven churches. In the seven epistles there are twelve promises. What is said of the churches in praise or blame, is complet ed in the number three. The refrain, \"who has ears to hear,\" etc., has ten words, divided by three and seven, and the seven by three and four; and the seven epistles are also so di vided. In the seals, trumpets, and vials, also, of this symbolic vision , the seven are divided by four and three. He who sends his message to Ephesus, \"holds the seven stars in his right hand, and walks amid the seven golden lamps.\" In six days, or periods, God created the Universe, and paused on the seventh day. Of clean beasts, Noah was directed to take by seve ns into the ark; and of fowls by sevens; because in seven days the rain was to commenc e. On the seventeent h day of the month. the rain began; on the seventeenth day of t he seventh month, the ark rested on Ararat. When the dove returned, Noah waited seven days before he sent her forth again; and again seven, after she return ed with the olive-leaf. Enoch was the seventh patriarch, Adam included, and Lamech lived 777 years. There were seven lamps in the great ca ndlestick of the Tabernacle and Temple, representing the seven planets. Seven times Moses sprinkled the anointing oil upon the altar. The days of consecration of Aaron a nd his sons were seven in number. A woman was unclean seven days after child-birth; one infected with leprosy was shut up seven days; seven times the leper was sprinkled with the blood of a slain bird; and seven days afterwards he must remain abroad out of his tent. Seven times, in purifying the leper, the priest was to sprinkle the consecrated oil; and seven times to sprinkle with the blood of the sacrificed bird the house to be purified. Seven times the blood of the slain bullock was sprinkled on the mercy-seat; and seven times on the altar. The seventh year was a Sabbath of rest; and at the end of seven ti mes seven years came the great year of jubilee. Seven days the people ate unleav ened bread, in the month of Abib. Seven weeks were counted from the time of first pu tting the sickle to the wheat. The Feast of the Tabernacles lasted seven days. Israel was in the hand of Midian seven ye ars before Gideon delivered them. The bullock sacrificed by him was seven ye ars old. Samson told Delilah to bind him with seven green"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"withes; and she wove the seven locks of hi s head, and afterwards shaved them off. Balaam told Barak to build for him seven altars. Jacob served seven years for Leah and seven for Rachel. Job had seven sons and th ree daughters, making the perfect number ten. He had also seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels. His friends sat down with him seven days and seven nights. His friends were ordered to sacrifice seven bullocks and seven rams; and again, at the end , he had seven sons and three daughters, and twice seven thousand sheep, and lived an hundred and forty, or twice seven times ten years. Pharaoh saw in his dream seven fat and seven lean kine, seven good ears and seven blasted ears of w heat; and there were seven year s of plenty, and seven of famine. Jericho fell, when seven priests, with seven trumpets, made the circuit of the city on seven successive days; once each day fo r six days, and seven times on the seventh. \"The seven eyes of the Lord,\" says Zechariah, \"run to and fro through the whole earth.\" Solomon was seven years in building the Temple. Seven angels, in the Apocalypse, pour out seven plagues, from seven vials of wrath. The scarlet-colored beast, on which the woman sits in the wilderness, has seven heads and ten horns. So also has the beast that rises Up out of the sea. Seven thunders uttered their voices. Seven angels sounded seven trumpets. Seven la mps of fire, the seven spirits of God, burned before the throne; and the Lamb that was slain h ad seven horns and seven eyes. EIGHT is the first cube, that of two. NINE is the square of three, and represented by the triple triangle. TEN includes all the other numbers. It is es pecially seven and three; and is called the number of perfection. Pythagoras represent ed it by the TETRACTYS, which had many mystic meanings. This symbol is sometimes co mposed of dots or points, sometimes of commas or yods, and in the Kabalah, of the letters of the name of Deity. It is thus arranged: , , , , , , , , , , The Patriarchs from Adam to Noah, inclus ive, are ten in number, and the same number is that of the Commandments. TWELVE is the number of the lines of equal le ngth that form a cube. It is the number of the months, the tribes, and the apostles; of the oxen under the Brazen Sea, of the stones on the breast-plate of the high priest. "},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" MORALS and DOGMA by ALBERT PIKE Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry , prepared for the Supreme Council of the Thirty Third Degree for the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States: Charleston, 1871. 3º - Master To understand literally the symbols and allegori es of Oriental books as to ante-historical matters, is willfully to close our eyes against the Light. To translate the symbols into the trivial and commonplace, is the blundering of mediocrity. All religious expression is symbolism; since we can describe only what we see, and the true objects of religion are THE SEEN. The earliest instru ments of education were symbols; and they and all othe r religious forms di ffered and still diff er according to external circumstances and imagery, and a ccording to differences of knowledge and mental cultivation. All language is symbolic, so far as it is applied to mental and spiritual phenomena and action. All words have, primaril y, a material sense, however they may afterward get, for the ignorant, a spiritual non- sense. \"To retract,\" for example, is to draw back, and when applied to a statement, is sy mbolic, as much so as a picture of an arm drawn back, to express the same thing, would be. The very word \"spirit\" means \"breath,\" from the Latin verb spiro, breathe. To present a visible symbol to the eye of anot her is not necessarily to inform him of the meaning which that symbol ha s to you. Hence the philosopher soon superadded to the symbols explanations addressed to the ear, su sceptible of more precision, but less effective and impressive than the painted or sculptured forms which he endeavored to explain. Out of these explanations grew by degrees a variety of narrations, whose true object and meaning were gradually forgotten, or lost in contradictions and incongruities. And when these were abandoned, and Philosophy resorted to definitions and formulas, its language was but a more complicated symbolism, attempting in the dark to grapple with and picture ideas impossible to be expresse d. For as with the visible symbol, so with the word: to utter it to you does not inform you of the exact meaning which it has to me; and thus religion and philosophy became to a gr eat extent disputes as to the meaning of words. The most abstract expression for DE ITY, which language can s upply, is but a sign or symbol for an object beyond our comprehension, and not more truthful and adequate than the images of OSIRIS and VISHNU, or t heir names, except as being less sensuous and explicit. We avoid sensuousness only by resorting to simple negation. We come at last to define spirit by saying that it is not matter. Spirit is--spirit. A single example of the symbolism of words will indicate to you one branch of Masonic study. We find in the English Rite this phra se: \"I will always hail, ever conceal, and never reveal;\" and in the Catechism, these: Q.'. \"I hail.\" A.'. \"I conceal,\" and ignorance, misunderstanding the word \"hail,\" has interpolated the phrase, \"From whence do you hail.\" But the word is really \"hele,\" from the Anglo-Saxon verb elan, helan, to cover, hide, or conceal. And this word is rendered by the Latin verb tegere, to cover or roof over. \"That ye fro me no thynge woll hele,\" says Gower. \"They hele fro me no priuyte,\" says the Romaunt of the Rose. \"To heal a house,\" is a common phrase in Sussex; and in the west"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"of England, he that covers a h ouse with slates is called a Healer. Wherefore, to \"heal\" means the same thing as to \"tile,\"--itself symbolic, as meaning, primarily, to cover a house with tiles,--and means to cover, hide, or conceal. Thus language too is symbolism, and words are as much misunderstood and misused as more material symbols are. Symbolism tended continually to become mo re complicated; and all the powers of Heaven were reproduced on earth, until a web of fiction and allegory was woven, partly by art and partly by the ignorance of error, wh ich the wit of man, wit h his limited means of explanation, will never unravel . Even the Hebrew Theism bec ame involved in symbolism and image-worship, borrowed probably from an older creed and remote regions of Asia,-- the worship of the Great Semitic Natu re-God AL or ELS and its symbolical representations of JEHOVA Himself were not ev en confined to poetical or illustrative language. The priests were monot heists: the people idolaters. There are dangers inseparable from symbolism, which afford an impressive lesson in regard to the similar risks attendant on the us e of language. The imagination, called in to assist the reason, usurps its place or leav es its ally helplessly entangled in itsweb. Names which stand for things are confounded with them; the means are mistaken for the end; the instrument of interpretation for th e object; and thus symbols come to usurp an independent character as truths and persons . Though perhaps a necessary path, they were a dangerous one by which to approach th e Deity; in which ma ny, says PLUTARCH, \"mistaking the sign for the thi ng signified, fell into a ridicul ous superstition; while others, in avoiding one extreme, plunged into the no less hideous gulf of irreligion and impiety.\" It is through the Mysteries, CICERO says, that we have learned the first principles of life; wherefore the term \"initiation\" is used with good reason; and they not only teach us to live more happily and agrceably, but they soft en the pains of death by the hope of a better life hereafter. The Mysteries were a Sacred Drama, exhibi ting some legend sign ificant of nature's changes, of the visible Universe in which t he Divinity is revealed, and whose import was in many respects as open to the Pagan as to the Christian. Nature is thc great Teacher of man; for it is the Revelation of God. It neit her dogmatizes nor attempts to tyrannize by compelling to a particular creed or special in terpretation. It presents its symbols to us, and adds nothing by way of explanation. It is the text without the commentary; and, as we well know, it is chiefly the commentary an d gloss that lead to error and heresesy and persecution. The earliest instructors of ma nkind not only adopted the lessons of Nature, but as far as possible adhered to her method of imparting them. In the Mysteries, beyond the current traditions or sacred and enigimati c recitals of the Temples, few explanations were given to the spectators, who were le ft, as in the school of nature, to make inferences for themselves. No other method could have suited every degree of cultivation and capacity. To employ nature's universa l symbolism instead of the technicalities of language, rewards the humblest inquirer, and discloses its secrets to every one in proportion to his preparatory training and his power to con1prellend them. If their philosophical meaning was above the comlire llension of some, their moral and political meanlngs are within the reach of all. These mystic shows and perform ances were not the reading of a lecture, but the opening of a problem. Requiring research, they were calculated to arouse the dormant intellect. They implied no hostility to Philosophy, because Philosoph y is the grea t expounder of symbolism; although its ancient interpretations were ofte n illfounded and incorrect. The alteration from symbol to dogma is fatal to beauty of expression, and leads to intolerance and assumed infallibility. * * * * * * If, in teaching the great doctrine of the divine nature of the Soul, and in striving to explain its longings after immortality, and in proving it s superiority over the souls of the animals,"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"which have no aspirations Heav enward, the ancients struggled in vain to express the nature of the soul, by comparin g it to FIRE and LIGHT, it will be well for us to consider whether, with all our boasted knowledge, we hav e any better or clearer idea of its nature, and whether we have not despairingly taken re fuge in having none at all. And if they erred as to its original place of abode, an d understood literally the mode and path of its descent, these were but the accessories of the great Truth, and probabl y, to the Initiates, mere allegories, designed to make the idea more palpable and impressive to the mind. They are at least no more fit to be smiled at by the self-conceit of a vain ignorance, the wealth of whose knowledge cons ists solely in words, than the bosom of Abraham, as a home for the spirits of the just dead; the gulf of actual fire, for the eternal torture of spirits; and the City of the New Jerusalem, with its walls of jasper a nd its edifices of pure gold like clear glass, its foundations of precious stones, and its gate s each of a single pearl. \"I knew a man,\" says PAUL , \"caught up to the third Heaven;... . that he was caught up into Paradise, and heard ineffable words, which it is not possible for a man to utter.\" And nowhere is the antagonism and conflict between the spirit and body more frequently and forcibly insisted on than in the writings of this apostle, nowhere th e Divine nature of the soul more strongly asserted. \"With the mind,\" he says, \"I serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin....As many as are led by the Spirit of God, ar e the sons of GOD.... The earnest expectation of the created waits fo r the manifestation of the sons of God.... The created shall be delivered from the bondag e of corruption, of the flesh liable to decay, into the glorious liberty of the children of God.\" * * * * * * Two forms of government are favorable to the prevalence of falsehood and deceit. Under a Despotism, men are false, treacherous, and deceitful through fear, like slaves dreading the lash. Under a Democracy they are so as a means of attaining popularity and office, and because of the gr eed for wealth. Experie nce will probably prove that these odious and detestable vices will grow mo st rankly and spread most rapidly in a Republic. When office and wealth become the gods of a peop le, and the most unworthy and unfit most aspire to the former, and fraud becomes the hi ghway to the latter, the land will reek with falsehood and sweat lies and chicane. When the offices are open to all, merit and stern integrity and the di gnity of unsullied honor will attain them only rarely and by accident. To be able to serve the country well, will ceas e to be a reason why the great and wise and learned should be select ed to render service. Other qualifications, less honorable, will be more available. To adapt one's opinions to the popular humor; to defend, apologize for, and justify the popular follies; to advocate the expedient and the plausible; to caress, cajole, and flatter the elector; to beg like a spaniel for his vote, even if he be a negro three removes from barbarism; to profess fr iendship for a competitor and stab him by innuendo; to set on foot that which at thir d hand shall become a lie, being cousin-german to it when uttered, and yet capable of bei ng explained away,--who is there that has not seen these low arts and base appliances put into practice, and becoming general, until success cannot be surely had by any more h onorable means ?--the result being a State ruled and ruined by ignorant and shallow medi ocrity, pert self-conceit, the greenness of unripe intellect, vain of a school-boy's smattering of knowledge. The faithless and th e false in public and in political life, will be faithless and false in private. The jockey in politics, like the jockey on the race-course, is rotten from skin to core. Everywhere he will see first to his ow n interests, and whoso leans on him will be pierced with a broken reed. His ambition is ignoble, lik e himself; and therefore he will seek to attain omce by ignobl e means, as he will seek to atta in any other coveted object,- -land, money, or reputation. At length, office and honor are divorced. The place that the small and shallow, the knave or the trickster, is deemed co mpetent and fit to fill, ceases to be worthy the ambition of the great and capable; or if not, these shri nk from a contest, the weapons to be used wherein are unfit for a gentleman to handle. T hen the habits of unprincipled advocates in law courts are naturalized in Senates, and pe ttifoggers wrangle there, when the fate of"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"the nation and the lives of millions are at stak e. States are even bego tten by villainy and brought forth by fraud, and rascalities are just ified by legislators cl aiming to be honorable. Then contested elections are decided by perjured votes or party considerations; and all the practices of the worst times of corrup tion are revived and exaggerated in Republics. It is strange that reverence for truth, that manliness and genuine loyalty, and scorn of littleness and unfair advantage, and genuine faith and godliness and large-heartedness should diminish, among statesmen and peopl e, as civilization advances, and freedom becomes more general, and universal suffrage implies universal worth and fitness ! In the age of Elizabeth, without unive rsal suffrage, or Societies for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, or popular lecturers, or Lycaea, the statesman, the me rchant, the burgher, the sailor, were all alike heroic, fearing God only, and man not at all. Let but a hundred or two years elapse, and in a Monarchy or Republic of the same race, nothing is less heroic than the merchant, the shrewd speculator, th e office-seeker, fearing man only, and God not at all. Reverence for greatness dies out, and is succeeded by base envy of greatness. Every man is in the way of many, either in the path to popularity or wealth. There is a general feeling of satisfaction when a great statesman is displaced, or a general, who has been for his brief hour the popular idol, is unfortunate and sinks from his high estate. It becomes a misfortune, if not a crime, to be above the popular level. We should naturally suppose that a nation in distress would take co unsel with the wisest of its sons. But, on the contra ry, great men seem never so sc arce as when they are most needed, and small men never so bold to insist on infesting place, as when mediocrity and incapable pretence and sophomoric greenness, and showy and sprightly incompetency are most dangerous. When France was in the extremity of revolutionary agony, she was governed by an assembly of provincial pe ttifoggers, and Robespierre, Marat, and Couthon ruled in the place of Mirabeau, Ve rgniaud, and Carnot. England was governed by the Rump Parliament, after she had beheaded her king. Cromwell extinguished one body, and Napoleon the other. Fraud, falsehood, trickery, and deceit in na tional affairs are the signs of decadence in States and precede convulsions or paralysis. To bully the weak and crouch to the strong, is the policy of nations governed by small medi ocrity. The tricks of the canvass for office are re-enacted in Senates. The Executive beco mes the dispenser of patronage, chiefly to the most unworthy; and men are bribed with offices instead of money, to the greater ruin of the Commonwealth. The Divine in human na ture disappears, and interest, grced, and selfishness takes it place. That is a sad and true allegory which represents the companions of Ulysses changed by the enchantments of Circ e into swine. * * * * * \"Ye cannot,\" said the Great Teacher, \"ser ve God and Mammon.\" When the thirst for wealth becomes general, it will be sought for as well dishonestly as honestly; by frauds and overreachings, by the knaveries of trade , the heartlessness of greedy speculation, by gambling in stocks and commodities that soon demoralizes a whole community. Men will speculate upon the n eeds of their ne ighbors and the distresses of their country. Bubbles that, bursting, impove rish multitudes, will be blown up by cunning knavery, with stupid credulity as its assistant s and instrument. Huge bankrupt cies, that startle a country like the earthquakes, and are more fatal, fraudulent assignments, engulfment of the savings of the poor, expansions and collapses of the currency, the crash of banks, the depreciation of Government securities, prey on the savings of self-denial, and trouble with their depredati ons the first nourishment of infancy and the last sands of life, and fill with inmates the churchyards and lunatic asyl ums. But the sharper and speculator thrives and fattens. If his country is fighting by a le vy en masse for her ve ry existence, he aids her by depreciating her paper, so that he may accumulate fabulous amounts with little outlay. If his neighbor is distressed, he bu ys his property for a song. If he administers upon an estate, it turns out insolvent, and the orphans are paupers. If his bank explodes, he is found to have taken care of himself in time. Society worships its paper-and-credit kings, as the old Hindus and Egyptians wors hipped their worthless idols, and often the"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"most obsequiously when in ac tual solid wealth they are the veriest paupers. No wonder men think there ought to be another world, in which the injustices of this may be atoned for, when they see the friends of ruined families begging the wealthy sharpers to give alms to prevent the orphaned victims from st arving, until they may findways of supporting themselves. * * * * * * States are chiefly avaricious of commerce and of territory. The latter leads to the violation of treaties, encroachments upon feeble ne ighbors, and rapacity toward their wards whose lands are coveted. Republics are, in this, as rapacious and unprincipled as Despots, never learning from history that inordinate expansion by rapine and fraud has its inevitable consequences in dismen1berment or subjugation. When a Republic begins to plunder its neighbors, the words of doom are already written on its walls. There is a judgment already pronounced of God upon whatever is unrighteous in the conduct of national affairs. When civil war tears the vitals of a Republic, let it look back and see if it has not been guilty of injustices; and if it has, let it humble itself in the dust ! When a nation becomes possessed with a spir it of commercial greed, beyond those just and fair limits set by a due regard to a moderate and reasonable degree of general and individual prosperity, it is a nation possess ed by the devil of commercial avarice, a passion as ignoble and demoralizing as avaric e in the individual; and as this sordid passion is baser and more unscrupulous than ambi tion, so it is more hateful, and at last makes the infected nation to be regarded as the enemy of the human race. To grasp at the lion's share of commerce, has always at last proven the ruin of States, because it invariably leads to injustices that make a State detestable; to a selfishness and crooked policy that forbid other nations to be the frie nds of a State that cares only for itself. Commercial avarice in India was the parent of more atrocities and greater rapacity, and cost more human lives, than the nobler ambi tion for extended empire of Consular Rome. The nation that grasps at the commerce of the world cannot but become selfish, calculating, dead to the noblest impulses and sy mpathies which ought to actuate States. It will submit to insults th at wound its honor, rather than endanger its commercial interests by war; while, to su bserve those interests, it will wage unjust war, on false or frivolous pretexts, its free people cheerfully allying themselves with despots to crush a commercial rival that has dared to exile its kings and elect its own ruler. Thus the cold calculations of a sordid self -interest, in nations commercially avaricious, always at last displace the sentiments and lofty impulses of Honor and Generosity by which they rose to greatness; which made E lizabeth and Cromwell alike the protectors of Protestants beyond the four seas of England, against cr owned Tyranny and mitred Persecution; and, if they had lasted, would have forbidden a lliances with Czars and Autocrats and Bourbons to re-enthrone t he Tyrannies of Incapacity, and arm the Inquisition anew with it s instruments of torture. The soul of the avaricious nation petrifies, like the soul of the individual who makes gold his god. Th e Despot will occasionally act upon noble and generous impulses, and help the weak against the strong, the right against the wrong. But commercial avarice is essentially egotistic, grasping, faithless, overreaching, crafty, cold, ungenerous, self ish, and calculating, controlled by considerations of self-interest alone. Hear tless and merciless, it has no sentiments of pity, sympathy, or honor, to make it pause in its remorseless career; and it crushes down all that is of impediment in its way, as its keels of commerce crush under them the murmuring and unheeded waves. A war for a great principle ennobles a nati on. A war for commercial supremacy, upon some shallow pretext, is despicable, and mo re than aught else demonstrates to what immeasurable depths of baseness men a nd nations can descend. Commercial greed"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"values the lives of men no more than it values the lives of ants. The slave-trade is as acceptable to a people enthralled by that gree d, as the trade in ivory or spices, if the profits are as large. It will by-and-by endeavor to compound with God and quiet its own conscience, by compelling those to whom it sold the slaves it bought or stole, to set them free, and slaughtering them by hecatombs if they refuse to obey the edicts of its philanthropy. Justice in no wise consists in meting out to another that exact measure of reward or punishment which we think and decree his merit, or what we call his crime, which is more often merely his error, deserves. The justic e of the father is not incompatible with forgiveness by him of the erro rs and offences of his child. The Infinite Justice of God does not consist in meting out exact measures of punishment for human frailties and sins. We are too apt to erect our own little a nd narrow notions of what is right and just into the law of justice, and to insist that God shall adopt that as Hi s law; to measure off something with our own little tape-line, and call it God's love of justice. Continually we seek to ennoble our own ignoble love of revenge and retaliationJ by misnaming it justice. Nor does justice consist in strictly governin g our conduct toward other men by the rigid rules of legal right. If there were a commu nity anywhere, in which all stood upon the strictness of this rule, there should be writ ten over its gates, as a warning to the unfortunates desiring admission to that i nhospitable realm, the words which DANTE says are written over the great gate of He ll: LET THOSE WHO ENTER HERE LEAVE HOPE BEHIND ! It is not just to pay the laborer in field or factory or workshop his current wages and no more, the lowest market-value of his labor, for so long only as we need that labor and he is able to work; for when sickness or old age overtakes him, that is to leave him and his family to starve; and God will curse wit h calamity the people in which the children of the laborer out of work eat the boiled gras s of the field, and mothers strangle their children, that they may buy food for them selves with the charit able pittance given for burial expenses. The rules of what is ordi narily termed \"Justice ,\" may be punctiliously observed among the fallen spirits th at are the aristocracy of Hell. * * * * * * Justice, divorced from sympathy, is selfish indifference, not in the least more laudable than misanthropic isolation. There is sympat hy even among the hair-like oscillatorias, a tribe of simple plants, armies of which may be discovered with the aid of the microscope, in the tiniest bit of scum from a stagnant poo l. For these will place themselves, as if it were by agreement, in separate companies, on the side of a vessel containing them, and seem marching upward in rows; and when a sw arm grows weary of its situation, and has a mind to change its quarters, each army holds on its way without confusion or intermixture, proceeding with great regularity and order, as if under t he directions of wise leaders. The ants and bees give each other mut ual assistance, beyond what is required by that which human creatures are apt to regard as the strict law of justice. Surely we need but reflect a little, to be convin ced that the individual man is but a fraction of the unit of society, and that he is indiss olubly connected with the rest of his race. Not only the actions, but the will and thoughts of ot her men make or mar his fortunes, control his destinies, are unto him life or death, di shonor or honor. The epidemics, physical and moral, contagious and infectious, public opin ion, popular delusions, enthusiasms, and the other great electric phenomena and currents, mo ral and intellectual, prove the universal sympathy. The vote of a single and obscure n1an, the utterance of self-will, ignorance, conceit, or spite, deciding an election and pl acing Folly or Incapacity or Baseness in a Senate, involves the country in war, sweeps away our fo rtunes, slaughters our sons, renders the labors of a life unavailing, and pus hes on, helpless, with all our intellect to resist, into the grave. These considerations ought to teach us that justice to ot hers and to ourselves is the same; that we cannot define our duties by ma thematical lines ruled by the square, but"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"must fill with them the gr eat circle traced by the compasses; that the circle of humanity is the limit, and we are but the point in its centre, the drops in the great Atlantic, the atom or particle, bound by a mys terious law of attr action which we term sympathy to every other atom in the mass; that the physical and moral welfare of others cannot be indifferent to us; that we have a direct and immediate interest in the public morality and popular intelligence, in the well-being and physical co mfort of the people at large. The ignorance of the people, their pauperism and destit ution, and consequent degradation, their brutalization and demoralization, are all di seases; and we cannot rise high enough above the people, nor shut ourselves up from them enough, to escape the miasmatic contagion and the great magnetic currents. Justice is peculiarly indispensable to natio ns. The unjust State is doomed of God to calamity and ruin. This is the teaching of the Eternal Wisdom and of history. \"Righteousness exalteth a nati on; but wrong is a reproach to nations.\" \"The Throne is established by Righteousness. Let the lips of the Ruler pronounce t he sentence that is Divine; and his mouth do no wrong in judgme nt !\" The nation that adds province to province by fraud and violence, that encroach es on the weak and plunders its wards, and violates its treaties and the obligation of its contracts, and for the law of honor and fair- dealing substitutes the exigencies of greed and the base precepts of policy and craft and the ignoble tenets of expediency, is predesti ned to destruction; for here, as with the individual, the consequences of wr ong are inevitable and eternal. A sentence is written against all that is unjust, written by God in the nature of man and in the nature of the Universe, because it is in the nature of the Infinite God. No wrong is really successful. The gain of injustice is a loss; its pleasu re, suffering. Iniquity often seems to prosper, but its success is its defea t and shame. If its consequences pass by the doer, they fall upon and crush his children. It is a philosophical, physical, and moral truth, in the form of a threat, that God visits the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, to the third and fourth generation of those who violate His laws. After a long while, the day of reckoning always comes, to nation as to individual; and always the knave deceives himself, and proves a failure. Hypocrisy is the homage that vice and wrong pay to virtue and justice. It is Satan attempting to clothe himself in the angelic ve sture of light. It is equ ally detestable in morals, politics, and religion; in the man and in the nation. To do injustice under the pretence of equity and fairness; to reprove vice in public and commit it in private; to pretend to charitable opinion and censorious ly condemn; to profes s the principles of Masonic beneficence, and close the ear to the wail of distress and the cry of suffering; to eulogize the intellig ence of the people, and plot to de ceive and betray t hem by means of their ignorance and simplicity; to prate of purity, and peculate; of honor, and basely abandon a sinking cause; of di sinterestedness, and sell one's vote for place and power, are hypocrisies as common as they are infamo us and disgraceful. To steal the livery of the Court of God to serve the Devil withal; to pretend to believe in a God of mercy and a Redeemer of love, and persecute those of a different faith; to de vour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers; to preach continence, and wallow in lust; to inculcate humility, and in pr ide surpass Lucifer; to pay ti the, and omit the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy and faith; to strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel; to make clean the outside of the cup and platte r, keeping them full within of extortion and excess; to appear outwardly righteous unto men, but within be full of hypocrisy and iniquity, is indeed to be like unto whited se pulchres, which appear beautiful outward, but are within full of bones of the dead and of all uncleanness. The Republic cloaks its ambition with the pr etence of a desire and duty to \"extend the area of freedom,\" and claims it as its \"manife st destiny\" to annex other Republics or the States or Provinces of others to itself, by open violence, or under obsolete, empty, and fraudulent titles. The Empire founded by a succes sful soldier, claims its ancient or natural boundaries, and makes necessity and its safe ty tlle plea for open robbery. The great Merchant Nation, gaining foothol d in the Orient, finds a continual necessity for extending its dominion by arms, and subjugates India. The great Royalties and Despotisms, without"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"a plea, partition among themselves a Ki ngdom, dismember Poland, and prepare to wrangle over the dominions of the Crescent. To maintain the balance of power is a plea for the obliteration of States . Carthage, Genoa, and Venice, commercial Cities only, must acquire territory by force or fraud, and beco me States. Alexander marches to the Indus; Tamerlane seeks universal empire; the Sara cens conquer Spain and threaten Vienna. The thirst for power is never satisfied. It is insatiable. Neither men nor nations ever have power enough. When Rome was the mistress of the world, the Emperors caused themselves to be worshipped as gods. The Chur ch of Rome claimed despotism over the soul, and over the whole life from the cradle to the grave. It gave and sold absolutions for past and future sins. It claimed to be infallib le in matters of faith. It decimated Europe to purge it of heretics. It decimated America to convert the Mexicans and Peruvians. It gave and took away thrones; and by excommunica tion and interdict closed the gates of Paradise against Nations, Spain, haughty with its dominion over the Indies, endeavored to crush out Protesta ntism in the Nether lands, while Philip t he Second married the Queen of England, and the pair sought to win that kingdom back to its allegiance to the Papal throne. Afterward Spain attempted to conquer it with her \"invincible\" Armada. Napoleon set his relatives and captains on thrones, and parcelled among them half of Europe. The Czar rules over an empire more gigantic than Rome. The history of all is or will be the same,--acquisi tion, dismemberment, ruin. There is a judgment of God against all that is unjust. To seek to subjugate the will of others and take the soul captive, because it is the exercise of thc highest power, seems to be th e highest object of human ambition. It is at the bottom of all proselyting and propagandism , from that of Mesmer to that of the Church of Rome and the French Republic. T hat was the apostolate alike of Joshua and of Mahomet. Masonry alone preaches Toleration, the right of man to abide by his own faith, the right of all States to govern them selves. It rebukes alike the monarch who seeks to extend his dominions by co nquest, the Church that claims the right to repress heresy by fire and steel, and the confederation of St ates that insist on maintaining a union by force and restoring brotherhood by slaughter and subjugation. It is natural, when we are wronged, to desire revenge; and to persuade ourselves that we desire it less for our own satisfaction than to prevent a repetition of the wrong, to which the doer would be encouraged by immunity c oupled with the profit of the wrong. To submit to be cheated is to encourage the cheater to continue; and we are quite apt to regard ourselves as God's chosen instrument s to inflict His vengeance, and for Him and in His stead to discourage wrong by making it fruitless and its punishment sure. Revenge has been said to be \"a kind of wild justice;\" but it is alwa ys taken in anger, and therefore is unworthy of a great soul, which ought not to suffer its equanimity to be disturbed by ingratitude or villainy. The in juries done us by the base are as much unworthy of our angry notice as those done us by the inse cts and the beasts; and when we crush the adder, or slay the wolf or hyena, we should do it without being moved to anger, and with no more feeling of revenge than we have in rooting up a noxious weed. And if it be not in human natu re not to take revenge by way of punishment, let the Mason truly consider that in doing so he is God's agent, and so let his revenge be measured by justice and tempered by mercy. The law of God is, that the cons equences of wrong and cruelty and crime shall be their punishment; and the injured and the wronged and the indignant are as much His instruments to enfor ce that law, as the diseases and public detestation, and the verdict of history and the execration of posterity are. No one will say that the Inquisitor who has racked and bu rned the innocent; the Spaniard who hewed Indian infants, living, into pieces with his sword, and fed the mangled limbs to his bloodhounds; the militar y tyrant who has shot men wit hout trial, the knave who has robbed or betrayed his State, the fraudule nt banker or bankrupt who has beggared orphans, the public officer who has violated hi s oath, the judge who has sold injustice, the legislator who has enabled Incapacity to work the ruin of the State, ought not to be punished. Let them be so; and let the injured or the sympathizing be the instruments of God's just vengeance; but always out of a hi gher feeling than mere personal revenge."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Remember that every moral characteristic of man finds its prototype an1ong creatures of lower intelligence; that the cruel foulness of the hyena, the savage rapacity of the wolf, the merciless rage of the tiger, the crafty treachery of the panther, are found among mankind, and ought to excite no other emot ion, when found in the man, than when found in the beast. Why should the true man be angry with the geese that hiss, the peacocks that strut, the asses that bray, and the apes t hat imitate and chatter, although they wear the human form? Always, also, it remains true, that it is more noble to forgive than to take revenge; and that, in general, we ought too mu ch to despise those who wrong us, to feel the emotion of anger, or to desire revenge. At the sphere of the Sun, you are in the re gion of LIGHT. * * * * The Hebrew word for gold, ZAHAB, also means Light, of which the Su n is to the Earth the great source. So, in the great Oriental allegory of the Hebrews, the River PISON compasses the land of Gold or Light; and the River GIHON th e land of Ethiopia or Darkness. What light is, we no more know than th e ancients did. According to the modern hypothesis, it is not composed of luminous particles shot out from the sun with immense velocity; but that body only impresses, on th e ether which fills all space, a powerful vibratory movement that extends, in the form of luminous waves, bey ond the most distant planets, supplying them with light and heat. To the ancients, it was an outflowing from the Deity. To us, as to them, it is the apt sym bol of truth and knowledge. To us, also, the upward journey of the soul through the Sphe res is symbolical; but we are as little informed as they whence the soul comes, where it has it s origin, and whither it goes after death. They endeavored to have some belief and faith, some creed, upon those points. At the present day, men are satisfied to think nothing in regard to all that, and only to believe that the soul is a something separate from the body and out-living it, but whether existing before it, neither to inquire nor care. No one asks whether it emanates from the Deity, or is created out of nothing, or is generated like the body, and the issue of the souls of the father and the mother. Let us not smile, therefore, at the ideas of the ancients, until we have a better belief; but ac cept their symbols as meaning that the soul is of a Divine nature, originat ing in a sphere nearer the Deity, and returning to that when freed from the enthralhment of the body; and t hat it can only return there when purified of all the sordidness and sin which have, as it were, become part of its substance, by its connection with the body. It is not strange that, thousands of years ag o, men worshipped the Sun, and that to-day that worship continues among the Parsees. Orig inally they looked beyond the orb to the invisible God, of whom the Sun's light, seem ingly identical with generation and life, was the manifestation and outflowing. Long befor e the Chaldcean shepher ds watched it on their plains, it came up regularly, as it now does, in the morning, like a god, and again sank, like a king retiring, in the west, to return again in due time in the same array of majesty. We worship Immutability. It was t hat steadfast, immutable character of the Sun that the men of Baalbec worshipped. His light-giving and life-giving powers were secondary attributes. The one grand idea that compelled worship was the characteristic of God which they saw reflected in his light, and fancied they saw in its originality the changelessness of Deity. He had seen thrones crwnble, earthquakes shake the world and hurl down mountains. Beyond Olympus, beyond the Pillars of Hercules, he had gone daily to his abode, and had come daily again in the morning to behold the temples they built to his worsl1ip. They personified hi m as BRAHMA, AMUN, OSRIS, BEL, ADONIS, MALKARTH, MITHRAS, and APOLL O; and the nations that di d so grew old and died. Moss grew on the capitals of the great columns of his temples, and he shone on the moss. Grain by grain the dust of his temples crumbled and fell, and was borne off on the wind, and still he shone on crum bling column and architrave. T he roof fell crashing on the pavement, and he shone in on the Holy of Holies with unchanging rays. It was not strange that men worshipped the Sun. There is a water-plant, on whose broad leaves the drops of water roll about without uniting, like drops of mercury. So arguments on points of faith, in po litics or religion, roll over the surface of the mind. An argument that convinces one mind has no effect on"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"another. Few intellects, or souls that are the negations of intellect, have any logical power or capacity. There is a singular obliqui ty in the human mind that makes the false logic more effective than the true with nine- tenths of those who are regarded as men of intellect. Even among the judges, not one in ten can argue logically. Each mind sees the truth, distorted through its own medium. Tr uth, to most men, is like matter in the spheroidal state. Like a drop of cold water on the surface of a red-hot metal plate, it dances, trembles, and spins, and never come s into contact with it; and the mind may be plunged into truth, as the ha nd moistened with sulphurous acid may into melted metal, and be not even warmed by the immersion. * * * * * * The word Khairum or Khurum is a compound one. Gesenius renders Khurum by the word noble or free-born: Khur meaning whit e, noble. It also means the opening of a window, the socket of the eye. Khri also me ans white, or an opening; and Khris, the orb of the Sun, in Job viii. 13 and x. 7. Krishna is the Hindu Sun- God. Khur, the Parsi word, is the literal name of the Sun. From Kur or Khur, the Sun, comes Khora, a name of Lower Egypt. The Sun, Bryant says in his Mythology, was called Kur; and Plutarch says that the Persians called the Sun Kuros. Kurios, Lord, in Greek, like Adonai, Lord, in Phcenician and Hebrew, was applied to the Sun. Many places were sacred to the Sun, and called Kura, Kuria, Kuropolis, Kurene, Kureschata, Kuresta, and Corusia in Scythia. The Egyptian Deity called by the Greeks \"Horus ,\" was Her-Ra, or Har-oeris, Hor or Har, the Sun. Hari is a Hindu name of the Sun. Ar i-al, Ar-es, Ar, Aryaman, Areimonios, the AR meaning Fire or Flame, are of the same ki ndred. Hewnes or Har-mes, (Aram, Remus, Haram, Harameias), was Kadmos, the Divine Li ght or Wisdom. Mar-kur i, says Movers, is Mar, the Sun. In the Hebrew, AOOR, is Light, Fire, or the Su n. Cyrus, said Ctesia s, was so named from Kuros, the Sun. Kuris, Hes ychius says, was Adonis. Apo llo, the Sun-god, was called Kurraios, from Kurra, a city in Phocis. The people of Kurene, originally Ethiopians or Cuthites, worshipped the Sun under the title of Achoor and Achor. We know, through a precise testimony in the ancient annals of Tsur, that the principal festivity of Mal-karth, the inca rnation of the Sun at the Wint er Solstice, held at Tsur, was called his rebirth or his awakening, and that it was celebrated by means of a pyre, on which the god was supposed to regain, through the aid of fire, a new life. This festival was celebrated in the month Peritius (Barit h), the second day of which corresponded to the 25th of December. KHUR-U M, King of Tyre, Movers says, first performed this ceremony. These facts we learn from Jo sephus, Servius on the AEneid, and the Dionysiacs of Nonnus; and through a coincidenc e that cannot be fo rtuitous, the same day was at Rome the Dies Natalis Solis Invicti, the festal day of the invincible Sun. Under this title, HERCULES, HAR-acles, was wors hipped at Tsur. Thus, while the temple was being erected, the death and resurrection of a Sun-God was annually represented at Tsur, by Solomon's ally, at the winter sols tice, by the pyre of MAL-KARIH, the Tsurian Haracles. AROERIS or HAR-oeris, the elder HORUS, is fr om the same old root that in the Hebrew has the form Aur, or, with the definite articl e prefixed, Haur, Light, or the Light, splendor, flame, the Sun and his rays. The hieroglyphic of the younger HORUS was the point in a circle; of the Elder, a pair of eyes; and the fest ival of the thirtieth day of the month Epiphi, when the sun and moon were supposed to be in the same right line with the earth, was called \"The birth-day of the eyes of Horus.\" In a papyrus published by C hampollion, this god is styled \"Haroeri, Lord of the Solar Spirits, the beneficent eye of the Sun.\" Plutarch calls him \"H ar-pocrates,\" but there is no"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"trace of the latter part of the name in the hi eroglyphic legends. He is the son of OSIRIS and Isrs; and is represented sitting on a throne supported by lions; the same word, in Egyptian, meaning Lion and Sun. So Solomon made a great throne of ivory, plated with gold, with six steps, at each arm of whic h was a lion, and one on each side to each step, making seven on each side. Again, the Hebrewword Khi, m eans \"living;\" and ram, \"was, or shall be, raised or lifted up.\" The latter is the same as room, aroom, harum, whence Aram, for Syria, or Aramoea, High-land. Khairum, therefore, would mean \"was raised up to life, or living.\" So, in Arabic, hrm, an unused root, meant, \"was high,\" \"made great,\" \"exalted;\" and Hirm means an ox, the symbol of the Sun in Taurus, at the Vernal Equinox. KHURUM, therefore, improperly called Hiram, is KHUR-OM, the same as Her-ra, Her- mes, and Her-acles, the \"Heracles Tyrius Invi ctus,\" the personificat ion of Light and the Son, the Mediator, Redeemer, and Saviour. Fr om the Egyptian word Ra came the Coptic Ouro, and the Hebrew Aur, Light. Har-oeri, is Hor or Har, the chief or master. Hor is also heat; and hora, season or hour; and hence in several African dialects, as names of the Sun, Airo, Ayero, eer, uiro, ghurrah, and th e like. The royal name rendered Pharaoh, was PHRA, that is, Pai-ra, the Sun. The legend of the contest between Hor-ra and Set, or Set-nu-bi, the same as Bar or Bal, is older than that of the stri fe between Osiris and Typhon; as old, at least, as the nineteenth dynasty. It is called in the Book of the Dead, \"The da y of the battle between Horus and Set.\" The later myth connects itse lf with Phoenicia and Syria. The body of OSIRIS went ashore at Gebal or Byblos, sixt y miles above Tsur. You will not fail to notice that in the name of each murderer of K hurum, that of the Evil God Bal is found. * * * * * Har-oeri was the god of TIME, as well as of Life. The Egyptian legend was that the King of Byblos cut down the tamari sk-tree containing the body of OSIRIS, and made of it a column for his palace. Isis, employed in th e palace, obtained possession of the column, took the body out of it, and carried it away. Apuleius describes her as \"a beautiful female, over whose divine neck her long thick hair hung in graceful ringlets ;\" and in the procession female attendants, with ivory co mbs, seemed to dress and ornament the royal hair of the goddess. The palm-tree, and the lamp in the shape of a boat, appeared in the procession. If the symbol we are speaki ng of is not a mere modern invention, it is to these things it alludes. The identity of the legends is also confirmed by this hierogl yphic picture, copied from an ancient Egyptian monument, which may also enlighten you as to the Lion's grip and the Master's gavel. in the ancient Phcenician character, and in the Samaritan, A B, (the two letters representing the numbers 1, 2, or Unity and Duality, means Father, and is a primitive noun, common to all the Semitic languages.

(Vav) final is the possessive pronoun \"his\"; and Abiu (which we read \"Abif\") means \"of my father's.\" Its full meaning, as connec ted with the name of Khurum, no doubt is, \"formerly one of my father's servants,\" or \"slaves.\" The name of the Phcenician artificer is, in Sa muel and Kings, [2 Sam. v. 11; 1 Kings v. 15; 1 Kings vii. 40]. In Chronicles it is with the addition of [2 Chron. ii. 12]; and of [2 Chron. iv. 16]. It is merely absurd to add the word \"Abif,\" or \"A biff,\" as part of the name of the artificer. And it is almost as absurd to add the word \"Abi,\" which was a title and not part of the name. Joseph says [Gen. xlv. 8], \"God has co nstituted me 'Ab l'Paraah, as Father to Paraah, i.e., Vizier or Prime Minister.\" So Haman was called the Second Father of Artaxerxes; and when King Khurum used the ph rase \"Khurum Abi,\" he meant that the artificer he sent Schlomoh wa s the principal or chief workman in his line at Tsur. A medal copied by Montfaucon exhibits a fe male nursing a child, with ears of wheat in her hand, and the legend (Iao). She is seated on clouds, a star at her head, and three ears of wheat rising from an altar before her. HORUS was the mediator, who was buried three days, was regenerated, and triumphed over the evil principle. The word HERI, in Sanscrit, means Shepherd, as well as Savior. CRISHNA is called Heri, as Jesus called Himself the Good Shepherd. Khur, means an aperture of a window, a ca ve, or the eye. Also it means white. It also means an opening, and noble, free-born, high-born. KHURM means consecrated, devot ed; in AEthiopic. It is the name of a city, [Josh. xix. 38]; and of a man, [Ezr. ii . 32, x. 31; Neh. iii. 11]. Khirah, means nobility, a noble race. Buddha is declared to comprehend in his own person the essence of the Hindu Trimurti; and hence the tri-literal monosyllable Om or Aum is applied to him as being essentially the same as Brahma-Vishnu-Siva. He is the same as Hermes, Thoth, Taut, and Teutates. One of his names is Heri-maya or Hermaya, which are evidently the same name as Hermes and Khirm or Khurm. Heri, in Sanscrit, means Lord. A learned Brother places over the two symbolic pillars, from right to left, the two words IHU and BAL: followed by the hieroglyphic equiva lent, of the Sun-God, Amun-ra. Is it an accidental coincidence, that in the name of each murderer are the two names of the Good and Evil Deities of the Hebrews; for Yu -bel is but Yehu-Bal or Yeho-Bal? and that the three final syllables of the names, a, o, um, make A.'.U.'.M.'. the sacred word of the Hindoos, meaning the Triune God, Life-giv ing, Life-preserving, Life-destroying: represented by the mystic character ?

It is certain at some time to be wh olly governed by agitators appealing to all the baser elements of the popular nature; by mo neyed corporations; by those enriched by the depreciation of government securities or paper; by small attorneys, schemers, money-jobbers, speculators a nd adventurers--an ignoble oligarchy, enriched by the distresses of the State, and fa ttened on the miseries of th e people. Then all the deceitful visions of equality and the rights of man end; and the wronged and plundered State can regain a real liberty only by passing through \"g reat varieties of untried being,\" purified in its transmigration by fire and blood. In a Republic, it soon comes to pass that parties gather round the negative and positive poles of some opinion or notion, and that the intolerant sp irit of a triumphant majority will allow no deviation from the standard of orth odoxy which it has set up for itself. Freedom of opinion will be professed and pretended to, but every one will ex ercise it at the peril of being banished from political communion with those who hold the reins and prescribe the policy to be pursued. Slavishnes s to party and obsequiousness to the popular whims go hand in hand. Political independence only occu rs in a fossil state; and men's opinions grow out of the acts they have been constrai ned to do or sanction. Flattery, either of individual or people, corrupts both the receiver and the giver; and adulation is not of more service to the people than to kings. A Ccesar , securely seated in power, cares less for it than a free democracy; nor will his appetite for it grow to exorbitance, as that of a people will, until it becomes insatiate. Th e effect of liberty to individu als is, that they may do what they please; to a people, it is to a great extent the same. If accessible to flattery, as this is always interested, and resorted to on low an d base motives, and for evil purposes, either individual or people is sure, in doing what it pleases, to do what in honor and conscience should have been left undone. One ought not even to risk congratulations, which may soon be turned into complaints; and as both individuals and peoples are prone to make a bad use of power, to flatter them, which is a sure way to mislead them, well deserves to be called a crime. The first principle in a Republic ought to be, \"that no man or set of men is entitled to exclusive or separate emoluments or privileges from the community, but in consideration of public services; which not being descendi ble, neither ought the omces of magistrate, legislature, nor judge, to be hereditary.\" It is a volume of Truth and Wisdom, a lesson for the study of nations, embodied in a single sentence, and expres sed in language which every man can understand. If a deluge of des potism were to overthrow the world, and destroy all institutions under which freedom is protected, so that they should no longer be remembered among men, this sentence, preserve d, would be suffici ent to rekindle the fires of liberty and revive the race of freemen. But, to preserve liberty, another must be ad ded: \"that a free State does not confer office as a reward, especially for questionable serv ices, unless she seeks her own ruin; but all officers are employed by her, in consideration solely of their will and ab ility to render service in the future; and therefore that t he best and most competent are always to be preferred.\" For, if there is to be any other rule, that of hereditary succession is perhaps as good as any. By no other rule is it possible to preser ve the liberties of the State. By no other to intrust the power of making the laws to thos e only who have that keen instinctive sense of injustice and wrong which enables them to detect baseness and corruption in their"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"most secret hiding-places, and that moral courage and generous manliness and gallant independence that make them fearless in dragging out the perpetrators to the light of day, and calling down upon them the scorn and in dignation of the world. The flatterers of the people are never such men. On the cont rary, a time always comes to a Republic, when it is not content, like Liberius, with a single Sejanus, but must have a host; and when those most prominent in the lead of affairs are me n without reputation, statesmanship, ability, or information, the me re hacks of party, owing their places to trickery and want of qualification, with none of the qualities of head or heart that make great and wise men, and, at the same time, filled with a ll the narrow conceptions and bitter intolerance of political bigotry. These die; and the world is none the wiser for what they have said and done. Their names sink in the bottomless pit of ob livion; but their acts of folly or knavery curse the body politic and at last prove its ruin. Politicians, in a free State, are generally hollow, heartless, a nd selfish. Their own aggrandisement is the end of their patriot ism; and they always look with secret satisfaction on the disappointment or fall of one whose loftier genius and superior talents overshadow their own self-impor tance, or whose integrity and incorruptible honor are in the way of their selfish ends. The influence of the small aspirants is always against the great man. His accession to power may be almo st for a lifetime. One of themselves will be more easily displaced, and each hopes to succeed him; and so it at length comes to pass that men impudently aspire to and actu ally win the highest stations, who are unfit for the lowest clerkships; and incapacity and mediocrity become the surest passports to once. The consequence is, that those who feel t hemselves competent and qualified to serve the people, refuse with digust to enter into the struggle for office, where the wicked and jesuitical doctrine that all is fair in politics is an excuse fo r every species of low villainy; and those who seek even the hi ghest places of t he State do not rely upon the power of a magnanimous spirit, on the sympathizing impuls es of a great soul, to stir and move the people to generous, noble, and heroic resolv es, and to wise and manly action; but, like spaniels erect on their hind legs, with fore-paw s obsequiously suppliant, fawn, flatter, and actually beg for votes. Rather than descend to this, they stand contemptuously aloof, disdainfully refusing to court the people, a nd acting on the maxim, that \"mankind has no title to demand that we shall serv e them in spite of themselves.\" * * * * * * It is lamentable to see a country split into fa ctions, each following this or that great or brazen-fronted leader with a blind, unreason ing, unquestioning her o-worship; it is contemptible to see it divided into parties, whose sole end is the spoils of victory, and their chiefs the low, the base, the venal and t he snlall. Such a country is in the last stages of decay, and near its end, no matter how pr osperous it may seem to be. It wrangles over the volcano and the earthquake. But it is ce rtain that no governm ent can be conducted by the men of the people, and for the people, without a rigid adherence to those principles which our reason commends as fixe d and sound. These must be the tests of parties, men, and measures. Once determine d, they must be inexorable in their application, and all must eit her come up to the standard or declare against it. Men may betray: principles never can. Oppression is one invariable consequence of misplaced confidence in treacherous man, it is never th e result of the working or application of a sound, just, well-tried principle. Compromise s which bring fundamental principles into doubt, in order to unite in one party men of antagonistic creeds, are frauds, and end in ruin, the just and natural consequence of fraud. Whenever you have settled upon your theory and creed, sanction no departure from it in practice, on any ground of expediency. It is the Master's word. Yield it up neither to flattery nor force ! Let no defeat or persecution rob you of it! Believe that he who once blundered in statesmanship will blunder again; that such blunders are as fatal as crimes; and that political near- sightedness does not improve by age. There are always more impostors than seers among public men, more false prophets than true ones, more prophets of Baal than of Jehovah; and Jerusalem is always in danger from the Assyrians."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Sallust said that after a State has been corr upted by luxury and idleness, it may by its mere greatness bear up under the burden of it s vices.

The Forty-seventh Proposition is older than Pyt hagoras. It is this: \"In every right-angled triangle, the sum of the square s of the base and perpendicular is equal to the square of the hypothenuse.\" The square of a number is the pr oduct of that number, multipli ed by itself. Thus, 4 is the square of 2, and 9 of 3. The first ten numbers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10; their squares are .........1, 4, 9,16,25,36, 49,64,81,100; and ...........................3,5, 7, 9,11,13,15,17, 19 are the differences between each square and that which precedes it; giving us the sacred numbers, 3, 5, 7, and 9 Of these numbers, the square of 3 and 4, add ed together, gives the square of 5; and those of 6 and 8, the square of 10; and if a right-angled triangle be formed, the base measuring 3 or 6 part s, and the perpendicular 4 or 8 pa rts, the hypothenuse will be 5 or 10 parts; and if a square is erected on each side, these squares being subdivided into squares each side of which is one part in length, there will be as many of these in the square erected on the hypothenuse as in the other two squares together. Now the Egyptians arranged their deities in Tr iads the FATHER or the Spirit or Active Principle or Generative Power; the MOTHER, or Matter, or the Passive Principle, or the Conceptive Power; and the SON, Issue or Product, the Universe, proceeding from the two principles. These were OSRIS, ISIS, and HORUS. In the same way, PLATO gives us thought the Father; Primitive Matter the Mo ther; and Kosmos the World, the Son, the Universe animated by a soul. Triads of the same kind are found in the Kabalah. PLUTARCH says, in his book De Iside et Os iride, \"But the better and diviner nature consists of three,--that which exists within the Intellect only, and Matter, and that which proceeds from these, which the Greeks call Kosm os; of which three, Plato is wont to call the Intelligible, the 'Idea, Exem plar, and Father', Matter, 't he Mother, the Nu rse, and the place and receptacle of generat ion'; and the issue of thes e two, 'the Offspring and Genesis,\"' the KOSMOS, \"a wo rd signifying equally Beauty and Order, or the Universe itself.\" You will not fail to notice that Beauty is symbolized by the Junior Warden in the South. Plutarch continues to say that the Egyptians compared the universal nature to what they called the most beautiful and perfec t triangle, as Plato do es, in that nuptial diagram, as it is termed, which he has intro duced into his Commonwealth. When he adds that this triangle is right-angled, and its side s respectively as 3, 4, and 5; and he says, \"We must suppose that the perpendicular is designed by them to represent the masculine nature, the base the feminine, and that the hypothenuse is to be looked upon as the offspring of both; and accordingly the first of them will aptly enough represent OSIRIS, or the prime cause; the second, IS IS, or the receptive capacity; the last, HORUS, or the common effect of the other tw o. For 3 is the first number which is"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"composed of even and odd; and 4 is a square whose side is equal to the even number 2; but 5, being generated, as it were, out of t he preceding numbers, 2 and 3, may be said to have an equal relation to both of them, as to its common parents.\" * * * * * * The clasped hands is another symbol which was used by PYTHAGORAS. It represented the number 10, the sacred number in which all the preceding numbers were contained; the number expressed by the mysterious TERACTYS, a figure borrowed by him and the Hebrew priests alike from the Egyptian sacred science, and which ought to be replaced among the symbols of the Master's degree, where it of right belongs. The Hebrews formed it thus, with the letters of the Divine name: The Tetractys thus leads you, not only to t he study of the Pythagorean philosophy as to numbers, but also to the Kabalah, and will aid you in discovering the True Word, and understanding what was meant by \"The Music of the Spheres.\" Mode rn science strikingly confirms the ideas of Pythagoras in regard to the properties of numbers, and that they govern in the Universe. Long before his time, nature had extracted her cube-roots and her squares. * * * * * * All the FORCES at man's disposal or under m an's control, or subject to man's influence, are his working tools. The friendship and sympat hy that knit heart to heart are a force like the attraction of cohesion, by which the sandy particles became the solid rock. If this law of attraction or cohesion were taken away, the material worlds and suns would dissolve in an instant into thin invisible vapor. If the ties of fr iendship, affection, and love were annulled, mankind would become a raging mu ltitude of wild and savage beasts of prey. The sand hardens into rock under the immense superincumbent pressure of the ocean, aided sometimes by the irresistible energy of fire; and when the pressure of calamity and danger is upon an order or a country, the members or the citizens ought to be the more closely united by the cohesion of sympathy and inter-dependence. Morality is a force. It is the magnetic attracti on of the heart toward Truth and Virtue. The needle, imbued with this mystic property, and pointing unerringly to the north, carries the mariner safely over the trackless ocean, th rough storm and darkness, until his glad eyes behold the beneficent beacons that welcome him to safe and hospitable harbor. Then the hearts of those who love him are gladdened, and his home made happy; and this gladness and happiness are due to the silent , unostentatious, uner ring monitor that was the sailor's guide over the weltering waters. Bu t if drifted too far nor thward, he finds the needle no longer true, but pointing elsew here than to the north, what a feeling of helplessness falls upon the dismayed mariner, what utter loss of e nergy and courage ! It is as if the great axioms of morality were to fail and be no longer true, leaving the human soul to drift helplessly, eyeless like Prometheu s, at the mercy of the uncertain, faithless currents of the deep. Honor and Duty are the pole-stars of a Mas on, the Dioscuri, by never losing sight of which he may avoid disastrous shipwreck. Th ese Palinurus watched, until, overcome by sleep, and the vessel no longer guided trul y, he fell into and was swallowed up by the insatiable sea. So the Mason who loses sight of these, and is no longer governed by their beneficent and po tential force, is lost, and sinki ng out of sight, will disappear unhonored and unwept. The force of electricity, analogous to that of sympathy, and by means of which great thoughts or base suggestions, the uttera nces of noble or ignoble natures, flash instantaneously over the nerves of nations; the force of grow th, fit type of immortality, Iying dormant three thousand years in the whea t-grains buried with their mummies by the old Egyptians; the forces of expansion and contraction, developed in the earthquake and"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"the tornado, and giving birth to the wonder ful achievements of steam, have their parallelisms in the moral world, in individual s, and nations. Growth is a necessity for nations as for men. Its cessation is the begi nning of decay. In the nation as well as the plant it is mysterious, and it is irresistib le. The earthquakes that rend nations asunder, overturn thrones, and engulf monarchies and republics, have been long prepared for, like the volcanic eruption. Revolutions have long roots in the past. The force exerted is in direct proportion to the previous restrain t and compression. The true statesman ought to see in progress the causes that are in due time to produce them; and he who does not is but a blind leader of the blind. The great changes in nations, like the geologic al changes of the ea rth, are slowly and continuously wrought. The waters, falling from Heaven as rain and dews, slowly disintegrate the granite mountains; abra de the plains, leaving hills and ridges of denudation as thei r monuments; scoop out the valleys, f ill up the seas, narrow the rivers, and after the lapse of thousands on thousand s of silent centuries, prepare the great alluvia for the growth of that plant, the snow y envelope of whose seeds is to employ the looms of the world, and the abundance or penury of whose crops shall determine whether the weavers and spinners of other re alms shall have work to do or starve. So Public Opinion is an immense force; and its currents are as inconstant and incomprehensible as those of the atmosphere. Nevertheless, in free governments, it is omnipotent; and the business of the statesman is to find the means to shape, control, and direct it. According as that is done, it is beneficial and conser vative, or destructive and ruinous. The Public Opinion of the civili zed world is International Law; and it is so great a force, though with no certain and fixe d boundaries, that it can even constrain the victorious despot to be generous, and aid an oppressed people in its struggle for independence. Habit is a great force; it is second nature, ev en in trees. It is as strong in nations as in men. So also are Prejudices, which are given to men and nations as the passions are,-- as forces, valuable, if properly and skillfully availed of; de structive, if un skillfully handled. Above all, the Love of Country, State Pride, the Love of Home, are forces of immense power. Encourage them all. Insist upon them in your public men. Permanency of home is necessary to patriotism. A migr atory race will have little love of country. State pride is a mere theory and chimera, where men remove from State to State with indifference, like the Arabs, who camp here to-day and there to-morrow. If you have Eloquence, it is a mighty force. See that you use it for good purposes--to teach, exhort, ennoble the people, and not to mislead and corrupt them. Corrupt and venal orators are the assassins of the public liberties and of public morals. The Will is a force; its limits as yet unknown. It is in the power of the will that we chiefly see the spiritual and divine in man. There is a seeming identity between his will that moves other men, and the Creative Will whose action s eems so incompr ehensible. It is the men of will and action, not the men of pure intellect , that govern the world. Finally, the three greatest moral forces are FA ITH, which is the only true WISDOM, and the very foundation of all government; HOPE, which is STRENGTH, and insures success; and CHARITY, which is BEAUTY, and alone makes animated, united effort possible. These forces are within the reach of all men; and an association of men, actuated by them, ought to exercise an im mense power in the world. If Masonry does not, it is because she ha s ceased to possess them. Wisdom in the man or statesman, in king or priest, largely consists in the due appreciation of these forces; and upon the g eneral non-appreciation of some of them the fate of nations often depends. What hecatomb s of lives often hang upon the not weighing or not sumciently weighing the force of an i dea, such as, for example, the reverence for a"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"flag, or the blind attachment to a form or constitution of government! What errors in political economy and stat esmanship are committed in consequence of the over-estimation or under-estimation of particular values, or the non-estimation of some among them ! Everything, it is asserted , is the product of human labor; but the gold or the diamond which one accidentally finds without labor is not so. What is the value of the labor bestowed by the husbandman upon his crops, compared with the value of the sunshine and rain, without which his labor av ails nothing? Commerce carried on by the labor of man, adds to the value of the products of the field, the mine, or the workshop, by their transportation to different markcts; but how much of this increase is due to the rivers down which these products float, to the winds that urge the keels of commerce over the ocean ! Who can estimate the value of morality and manliness in a State, of moral worth and intellectual knowledge ? These are the sunshine and rain of the State. The winds, with their changeable, fickle, fluctuating currents, ar e apt emblems of the fickle humors of the populace, its passions, its heroic impulses, its enthusiasms. Woe to the statesman who does not estimate these as values ! Even music and song are sometimes found to have an incalculable value. Every nation has some song of a proven value, more easily counted in lives than dollars. The Marseillaise was worth to revolutionary Franc e, who shall say how many thousand men? Peace also is a great element of prosperity and wealth; a value not to be calculated. Social intercourse and association of men in beneficent Orders have a value not to be estimated in coin. The illustrious examples of the Past of a nation, the memories and immortal thoughts of her great and wise thinkers, statesmen, and heroes, are the invaluable legacy of that Past to the Present and Future. And all these have not only the values of the loftier and more excellent an d priceless kind, but also an actual money- value, since it is only when co-operating with or aided or enabled by these, that human labor creates wealth. They are of the chief el ements of material wealth, as they are of national manliness, heroism., glory, prosperity, and i mmortal renown. Providence has appointed the three great di sciplines of War, the Monarchy and the Priesthood, all that the CAMP, the PALACE, and the TEMPLE may symbolize, to train the multitudes forward to intelligent and pr emeditated combinations for all the great purposes of society. The re sult will at length be free governments am ong men, when virtue and intelligence become qualities of the multitudes; but for ignorance such governments are impossible. Man advances only by degrees. The removal of one pressing calamity gives courage to attempt the removal of the remaining evils, rendering men more sensitive to them, or perhaps sensit ive for the first time. Serfs that writhe under the whip are not disquieted about tbei r political rights; manumitted from personal slavery, they be come sensit ive to political oppression. Liberated from arbitrary power, and governed by the law alone, they begin to scrutinize the law itself, and desire to be governed, not only by law, but by what they deem the best law. And when the civil or temporal despotism has been set aside, and the municipal law has been moulded on the principles of an enlightened jurisprudence, they may wake to the discovery that they are living under some priestly or ecclesiastical despotism, and become desirous of working a reformation there also. It is quite true that the adva nce of humanity is slow, and that it often pauses and retrogrades. In the kingdoms of the earth we do not see despotisms retiring and yielding the ground to self-governing communities. We do not see the churches and priesthoods of Christendom relinquishing their old task of governing men by imaginary terrors. Nowhere do we see a populace that could be safely manumitted from such a government. We do not see the great religi ous teachers aiming to discover truth for themselves and for others; but still ruling the world, and cont ented and compelled to rule the world, by whatever dogma is already accredited; themselves as much bound down"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"by this necessity to govern, as the populace by their need of government. Poverty in all its most hideous forms still exis ts in the great cities; and t he cancer of pauperism has its roots in the hearts of kingdoms. Men there ta ke no measure of their wants and their own power to supply them, but live and multiply like the beasts of the field,--Providence having apparently ceased to care for them. Intellig ence never visits thes e, or it makes its appearance as some new deve lopment of villainy. War ha s not ceased; still there are battles and sieges. Homes ar e still unhappy, and tears and anger aud spite make hells where there should be heavens. So much th e more necessity for Masonry ! So much wider the field of its labors ! So much the more need for it to begin to be true to itself, to revive from its asphyxia, to repent of its apostasy to its true creed ! Undoubtedly, labor and death and the se xual passion are es sential and permanent conditions of human exis tence, and re nder perfection and a millennium on earth impossible. Always,--it is the decree of Fate !- -the vast majority of men must toil to live, and cannot find time to cult ivate the intelligence. Man, k nowing he is to die, will not sacrifice the present enjoyment for a greater one in the future. The love of woman cannot die out; and it has a terrible and uncontroll able fate, increased by the refinements of civilization. Woman is the veritable syren or goddess of the young. But society can be improved; and free government is possibl e for States; and freedom of thought and conscience is no longer wholly utopian. Alre ady we see that Emperors prefer to be elected by universal suffrage; that States are conveyed to Empires by vote; and that Empires are administered with something of the spirit of a Republic, being little else than democracies with a single head, ruling through one man, one represent ative, instead of an assembly of representatives. And if Pr iesthoods still govern, t hey now come before the laity to prove, by stress of argument, th at they ougllt to govern. They are obliged to evoke the very reason which they are bent on supplanting. Accordingly, men become daily more free, because the freedom of the man lies in his reason. He can reflect upon his own fu ture conduct, and summon up its consequences; he can take wide views of human life, and la y down rules for constant guidance. Thus he is relieved of the tyranny of sense and pass ion, and enabled at any time to live according to the whole light of the knowledge that is within him, instead of being driven, like a dry leaf on the wings of the wind, by every pr esent impulse. Herein lies the freedom of the man as regarded in connection with the necess ity imposed by the omnipotence and fore- knowledge of God. So much light, so much liberty. When emperor and church appeal to reason there is naturally universal suffrage. Therefore no one need lose cour age, nor believe that labor in the cause of Progress will be labor wasted. There is no wa ste in nature, either of Matte r, Force, Act, or Thought. A Thought is as much the end of life as an Ac tion; and a single Thought sometimes works greater results than a Revolution, even Revo lutions themselves. Still there should not be divorce between Thought and Action. The true T hought is that in wh ich life culminates. But all wise and true Thought produces Action. It is generative, like the light; and light and the deep shadow of the passing cloud ar e the gifts of the prophets of the race. Knowledge, laboriously acquired, and inducing habits of soun d Thought,--the reflective character,--must necessarily be rare. The mu ltitude of laborers cannot acquire it. Most men attain to a very low standard of it. It is incompatible with the ordinary and indispensable avocations of life. A whole worl d of error as well as of labor, go to make one reflective man. In the most advanced nat ion of Europe there are more ignorant than wise, more poor than rich, more autornatic laborers, the mere creatures of habit, than reasoning and reflective men. The proportion is at least a thousand to one. Unanimity of opinion is so obtained. It only exists am ong the multitude who do not think, and the political or spiritual priesthood who think for that multitude, who think how to guide and govern them. When men begin to reflect, they begin to differ. The great problem is to find guides who will not seek to be tyrants. This is needed even more in respec t to the heart than the head. Now, every man earns his sp ecial share of the produce of human labor, by an incessant scramble, by trickery and deceit. Useful knowledge, honorably acquired, is too often used after a fashion not honest or reasonable, so that the studies of youth are far more noble than the practices of m anhood. The labor of the farmer in his fields,"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"the generous returns of the earth, the beni gnant and favoring skies, tend to make him earnest, provident, and gratef ul; the education of the market-place makes him querulous, crafty, envious, and an intolerable niggard. Masonry seeks to be this beneficent, unambitiou s, disinterested guide; and it is the very condition of all great structures that the so und of the hammer and the clink of the trowel should be always heard in some part of the building. With faith in man, hope for the future of humanity, loving-k indness for our fellows, Masonry and the Mason must always work and teach. Let each do that for which he is best fitted. The teacher also is a workman. Praiseworthy as the active navi gator is, who comes and goes and makes one clime partake of the treasures of the other, and one to share the treasures of all, he who keeps the beacon-light upon t he hill is also at his post. Masonry has already helped cast down some i dols from their pedestals, and grind to impalpable dust some of the links of the chai ns that held men's souls in bondage. That there has been progress needs no other de monstration than that you may now reason with men, and urge upon them, without danger of the rack or stake, that no doctrines can be apprehended as truths if they contradict each other, or contradict other truths given us by God. Long before the Reformation, a m onk, who had found his way to heresy without the help of Martin Luther, not venturine to breathe aloud into any living ear his anti-papal and treasonable doctrines, wrote them on parchment, and sealing up theperilous record, hid it in the massive walls of his monastery. There was no friend or brother to whom he could intrust his secret or pour forth his soul. It was some consolation to imagine that in a future age some one might find the parchment, and the seed be found not to have been sown in vain. What if the truth should have to lie dormant as long before germinating as the wheat in the Egyptian mummy ? Speak it, nevertheless, again and again, and let it take its chance ! The rose of Jericho grows in the sandy dese rts of Arabia and on the Syrian housetops. Scarcely six inches high, it loses its leaves after the flowering season, and dries up into the form of a ball. Then it is uprooted by the winds, and carried, blown, or tossed across the desert, into the sea. There, feeling the contact of the water, it unfolds itself, expands its branches, and expels its seeds from their seed-vessels. These, when saturated with water, are carried by the tide and laid on the sea-shore. Many are lost, as many individual lives of men are useless. But many are thrown back again from the sea-shore into the desert, where, by the virtue of t he sea-water that they have imbibed, the roots and leaves sprout and they grow into fruitful plants, which will, in their turns, like their ancestors, be whirled into the sea. God will not be less carefu l to provide for the germination of the truths you may boldly utte r forth. \"Cast,\" He has said, \"thy bread upon the waters, and after many days it shall return to thee again.\" Initiation does not change: we find it again and again, and always the same, through all the ages. The last disciples of Pascalis Mart inez are still the child ren of Orpheus; but they adore the realizer of the antique philoso phy, the Incarnate Word of the Christians. Pythagoras, the great divulger of the philosoph y of numbers, visited all the sanctuaries of the world. He went into Judaea, where he pr ocured himself to be circumcised, that he might be admitted to the secret s of the Kabalah, which the prophets Ezekiel and Daniel, not without some reservations, communicated to him. Then, not without some difficulty, he succeeded in being admitted to the Egypti an initiation, upon the recommendation of King Amasis. The power of his genius s upplied the deficiencie s of the imperfect communications of the Hierophants, and he himself became a Master and a Revealer. Pythagoras defined God: a Living an d Absolute Verity clothed with Light. He said that the Word was Number manifested by Form. He made all descend from the Tetyactys, that is to say, fr om the Quaternary."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"God, he said again, is the Supreme Musi c, the nature of which is Harmony. Pythagoras gave the magistrate s of Crotona this great re ligious, political and social precept: \"There is no evil that is not preferable to Anarchy.\" Pythagoras said, \"Even as there are three di vine notions and free intelligible regions, so there is a triple word, for t he Hierarehical Order always mani fests itself by threes. There are the word simple, the word hieroglyphica l, and the word symbolic: in other terms, there are the word that expresses, the word that conceals, and the word that signifies; the whole hieratic intelligence is in the perfect knowledge of these three degrees.\" Pythagoras enveloped doctrine with symbol s, but carefully eschewed personifications and images, which, he thought, sooner or later produced idolatry. The Holy Kabalah, or tradition of the child ren of Seth, was carried from Chaldcea by Abraham, taught to the Egyptian priesthood by Joseph, recovered and purified by Moses, concealed under symbols in the Bible, rev ealed by the Saviour to Saint John, and contained, entire, under hieratic figures an alogous to those of all antiquity, in the Apocalypse of that Apostle. The Kabalists consider God as the Intelligent, Animated, Living Infinite. He is not, for them, either the aggregate of existences, or existence in the abstract, or a being philosophically definable. He is in all, dist inct from all, and greater than all. His name even is ineffable; and yet this name only ex presses the human ideal of His divinity. What God is in Himself, it is not given to man to comprehend. God is the absolute of Faith; bu t the absolute of Reason is BEING, \"I am that I am,\" is a wretched translation. Being, Existence, is by itself, and because it Is. The reason of Being, is Being itself. We may inquire, \"Why does something exist?\" that is, \"Why does such or such a thing exist?\" But we cannot, without being absurd, ask, \"Why Is Being?\" That would be to suppose Being before Being. If Being had a cause, th at cause would necessar ily Be; that is, the cause and effect would be identical. Reason and science demonstrate to us that the modes of Existence and Being balance each other in equilibrium acco rding to harmonious and hierarchic laws. But a hierarchy is synthetized, in ascending, and becomes ever more and more monarchial. Yet the reason cannot pause at a simle chief, without being alarmed at the abysses which it seems to leave above this Supreme Monarch. Therefore it is silent, and gives place to the Faith it adores. What is certain, even for science and the reas on, is, that the idea of God is the grandest, the most holy, and the most useful of all t he aspirations of man; that upon this belief morality reposes, with its eternal sanction. This belief, then, is in humanity, the most real of the phenomena of being; and if it were false, nature would affirm the absurd; nothingness would give form to life, and Go d would at the same time be and not be. It is to this philosophic and incontestable rea lity, which is termed T he Idea of God, that the Kabalists give a name. In this name all others are contained. Its cyphers contain all the numbers; and the hieroglyphics of its letters express all the laws and all the things of nature. BEING IS BEING: the reason of Being is in Being: in the Beginning is the Word, and the Word in logic formulated Speech, the spoken Reason; the Word is in God, and is God"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Himself, manifested to the Intelligence. Here is what is above all the philosophies. This we must believe, under the penalty of never truly knowing anything, and relapsing into the absurd skepticism of Pyrrho. The Priesth ood, custodian of Faith, wholly rests upon this basis of knowledge, and it is in its teachings we must recognize the Divine Principle of the Eternal Word. Light is not Spirit, as the Indian Hierophants be lieved it to be; but only the instrument of the Spirit. It is not the body of the Protopl astes, as the Theurgis ts of the school of Alexandria taught, but the firs t physical manifestation of the Divine afflatus. God eternally creates it, and man, in the image of God, modifies and seems to multiply it. The high magic is styled \"The Sacerdotal Art,\" and \"The Royal Art.\" In Egypt, Greece, and Rome, it could not but share the great nesses and decadences of the Priesthood and of Royalty. Every philosophy hostile to the na tional worship and to its mysteries, was of necessity hostile to th e great political powers, whichlose their grandeur, if they cease, in the eyes of the multitudes, to be the im ages of the Divine Power. Every Crown is shattered, when it clas hes against the Tiara. Plato, writing to Dionysius the Younger, in re gard to the nature of the First Principle, says: \"I must write to you in enigmas, so that if my letter be intercepted by land or sea, he who shall read it may in no degree comprehend it.\" And then he says, \"All things surround their King; they are, on account of Him, and He alone is the cause of good things, Second for the Seconds and Third for the Thirds.\" There is in these few words a complete summ ary of the Theology of the Sephiroth. \"The King\" is AINSOPH, Being Supreme and Absolute . From this centre, which is everywhere, all things ray forth; but we especially conceive of it in three manners and in three different spheres. In the Divine world (AZILUTH), which is that of the First Cause, and wherein the whole Eternity of Things in the beginning existed as Unity, to be afterward, during Eternity uttered forth, clothed with form, and the attributes that c onstitute them matter, the First Principle is Single and First, and yet not the VERY Illimitable Deity, incomprehensible, undefinable; but Himself in so far as manifested by the Creative Thought. To compare littleness with infinity,--A rkwright, as inventor of the spinning-jenny, and not the man Arkwright otherwise and beyo nd that. All we can know of the Very God is, compared to His Wholeness, only as an infi nitesimal fraction of a unit, compared with an infinity of Units. In the World of Creation, which is that of Second Causes [the K abalistic World BRIAH], the Autocracy of the First Principle is complete , but we conceive of it only as the Cause of the Second Causes. Here it is manifested by the Binary, and is the Creative Principle passive. Finally: in the third world, YEZIRAH, or of Formation, it is revealed in the perfect Form, the Form of Forms, th e World, the Supreme Beauty and Excellence, the Created Perfection. Thus the Principle is at once the First, the Second, and the Third, since it is All in All, the Centre and Cause of all. It is not the genius of Plat o that we here admire. We recognize only the exact knowledge of the Initiate. The great Apostle Saint John did not borrow from the philosophy of Plato the opening of his Gospel. Plato, on t he contrary, drank at the same sp rings with Saint John and Philo; and John in the opening verses of his paraphr ase, states the first principles of a dogma common to many schools, but in language es pecially belonging to Bhilo, whom it is evident he had read. The philosophy of Plato, the greatest of human Revealers, could yearn toward the Word made man; the Gospel alone coul d give him to the world. Doubt, in presence of Being and its harmonies ; skepticism, in the face of the eternal mathematics and the immutable laws of Life which make the Divinity present and visible everywhere, as the Human is known and visible by its utterances of word and act,--is this not the most foolish of supers titions, and the most inexcu sable as well as the most dangerous of all credulities ? Thought, we know, is not a result or consequence of the"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"organization of matter, of the chemical or ot her action or reaction of its particles, like effervescence and gaseous explosions. On the contrary, the fact that Thought is manifested and realized in act human or act di vine, proves the existe nce of an Entity, or Unity, that thinks. And the Universe is the Infi nite Utterance of one of an infinite number of Infinite Thoughts, which cannot but eman ate from an Infinite and Thinking Source. The cause is always equal, at least, to the effec t; and matter cannot think, nor could it cause itself, or exist without cause, nor could nothing produce either forces or things; for in void nothingness no Forces can inhere. Admit a self -existent Force, and its Intelligence, or an Intelligent cause of it is adm itted, and at once GOD Is. The Hebrew allegory of the Fall of Man, whic h is but a special vari ation of a universal legend, symbolizes one of the grandest and mo st universal allegories of science. Moral Evil is Falsehood in actions, as Falsehood is Crime in words. Injustice is the essence of Falsehood; and every false word is an injustice. Injustice is the death of the Moral Being, as Falsehood is the poison of the Intelligence. The perception of the Li ght is the dawn of the Eternal Life, in Being. The Word of God, which creates the Light, seems to be utte red by every Intelligence that can take cognizance of Forms and will look . \"Let the Light BE! The Light, in fact, exists, in its condition of splendor, for those eyes alone that gaze at it; and the Soul, amorous of the spectacle of the beauties of the Universe, an d applying its attention to that luminous writing of the Infinite Book, which is called \"The Visible,\" seems to utter, as God did on the dawn of the first day, that sub lime and creative word, \"BE! LIGHT !\" It is not beyond the tomb, but in life itself, that we are to seek for t he mysteries of death. Salvation or reprobation begins here below, and the terrestrial wo rld too has its Heaven and its Hell. Always, even here below, virtue is rewarded; always, even here below, vice is pwlished; and that which makes us sometime s believe in the impuni ty of evil-doers is that riches, those instruments of good and of evil, seem sometimes to be given them at hazard. But woe to unjust men, when they po ssess the key of gold ! It opens, for them, only the gate of the tomb and of Hell. All the true Initiates have recognized the us efulness of toil and sorrow. \"Sorrow,\" says a German poet, \"is the dog of that unknown shepherd who guides the flock of men.\" To learn to suffer, to le arn to die, is the discipline of Eternity, the immo rtal Novitiate. The allegorical picture of Cebes, in which t he Divine Comedy of Da nte was sketched in Plato's time, the description whereof has been preserved for us, and which many painters of the middle age have reproduced by this description, is a monument at once philosophical and magical. It is a most comp lete moral synthesis, and at the same time the most audacious demonstration ever give n of the Grand Arcanum, of that secret whose revelation would overturn Earth and H eaven. Let no one expect us to give them its explanation ! He who passes behind the veil that hides this mystery, understands that it is in its very nature inexplic able, and that it is death to t hose who win it by surprise, as well as to him who reveals it. This secret is the Royalty of the Sages, the Crown of the Initiate whom we see redescend victorious from the summit of Tria ls, in the fine allegory of Cebes. The Grand Arcanun1 makes him master of gold and the light, which are at bottom the same thing, he has solved the problem of the quadrature of the circle, he directs the perpetual movement, and he possesses th e philosophical stone. Here the Adepts w ill understand us. There is neither interruption in the toil of nature, nor gap in her work. The Harmonies"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"of Heaven correspond to those of Earth, and the Eternal Life accomp lishes its evolutions in accordance with the same laws as the life of a dog. \"God has arranged all things by weight, number, and measure,\" sa ys the Bible; and this lumino us doctrine was also that of Plato. Humanity has never really had but one religion and one worship. This universal light has had its uncertain mirages, its deceitful reflecti ons, and its shadows; but always, after the nights of Error, we see it reappear, one and pure like the Sun. The magnificences of worship are the life of re ligion, and if Christ wishes poor ministers, His Sovereign Divinity does not wish palt ry altars. Some Protestants have not comprehended that worship is a teaching, and that we must not create in the imagination of the multitude a mean or miserable God. Those oratories that resemble poorly- furnished offices or inns, and those worthy mi nisters clad like notaries or lawyer's clerks, do they not necessarily cause religion to be regarded as a mere puritanic formality, and God as a Justice of the Peace? We scoff at the Augurs. It is so easy to scof f, and so difficult well to comprehend. Did the Deity leave the whole world without Light for tw o score centuries, to illuminate only a little corner of Palestine and a brutal, ig norant, and ungrateful people? Why always calumniate God and the Sanctuary ? Were there never any others than rogues among the priests? Could no honest and sincere men be found among the Hierophants of Ceres or Diana, of Dionusos or Apo llo, of Hermes or Mithras ? Were these, then, all deceived, like the rest? Who, then, cons tantly deceived them, without betraying themselves, during a series of centuries?--for the cheats are not immortal ! Arago said, that outside of the pure mathematics, he who utters the word \"impossible,\" is wanting in prudence and good sense. The true name of Satan, the Kabalists say, is that of Yahveh reversed; for Satan is not a black god, but the negation of Go d. The Devil is the personifica tion of Atheism or Idolatry. For the Initiates, this is not a Person, but a Force, create d for good, but which may serve for evil. It is the instrument of Liberty or Free Will. They repres ent this Force, which presides over the physical generation, under the mythologic and horned form of the God PAN; thence came the he-goat of the Sabbat, brother of the Ancient Serpent, and the Light-bearer or Phosphor, of which the poets have made the false Luc ifer of the legend. Gold, to the eyes of the Initiates, is Ligh t condensed. They style the sacred numbers of the Kabalah \"golden numbers,\" and the mora l teachings of Pythagoras his \"golden verses.\" For the same reason, a mysterious book of Apuleius, in which an ass figures largely, was called \"The Golden Ass.\" The Pagans accused the Christi ans of worshipping an ass, a nd they did not invent this reproach, but it came from the Samaritan Jews, who, figuring the data of the Kabalah in regard to the Divinity by Egyptian symbols, al so represented the Intelligence by the figure of the Magical Star adored under the name of Remphan, Science under the emblem of Anubis, whose name they changed to Nibbas, a nd the vulgar faith or credulity under the figure of Thartac, a god represented with a book, a cloak, and the head of an ass. According to the Samaritan Doctors, Christiani ty was the reign of Thartac, blind Faith and vulgar credulity erected into a universal or acle, and preferred to Intelligence and Science. Synesius, Bishop of Ptolemais, a great Ka balist, but of doubtful orthodoxy, wrote: \"The people will always mock at things easy to be misunder stood; it mu st needs have impostures.\" \"A Spirit,\" he said, \"that loves wisdom and contemplates the Truf h close at hand, is"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"forced to disguise it, to induce the multitudes to accept it.... Fictions are necessary to the people, and the Truth becomes deadly to those who are not strong enough to contemplate it in all its brilli ance. If the sacerdotal laws allowed the reservation of judgments and the allegory of words, I woul d accept the proposed dignity on condition that I might be a philosopher at home, and abroad a narrator of apologues and parables..... In fact, what c an there be in common between the vile mu ltitude and sublime wisdom? The truth must be kept secret, and the masses need a teaching proportioned to their imperfect reason.\" Moral disorders produce physical ugliness, and in some sort realize those frightful faces which tradition assigns to the demons. The first Druids were the true children of the Magi, and their initiation came from Egypt and Chaldaea, that is to say, from the pur e sources of the primitive Kabalah. They adored the Trinity under the names of Isis or Hesus, the Supreme Harmony; of Belerl or Bel, which in Assyrian means Lord, a name co rresponding to that of ADONAI; and of Camul or Camael, a name that in the Kabalah personifies the Divine Justice. Below this triangle of Light they supposed a divine refl ection, also composed of three personified rays: first, Teutates or Teuth, the same as the Thoth of the Egyptians, the Word, or the Intelligence formulated; then Force and Beauty, whose na mes varied like their emblems. Finally, they completed the sacred Septenary by a mysterious image that represented the progress of the dogma and its future r ealizations. This was a young girl veiled, holding a child in her arms; and they dedicate d this image to \"The Virgin who will become a mother;--Virgini pariturae.\" Hertha or Wertha, the young Isis of Gaul, Quee n of Heaven, the Virgin who was to bear a child, held the spindle of the Fates, filled wi th wool half white and half black; because she presides over all forms and all symbols, and weaves the garment of the Ideas. One of the most mysterious pa ntacles of the Kabalah, contain ed in the Enchiridion of Leo III., represents an equ ilateral triangle revers ed, inscribed in a doub le circle. On the triangle are written, in such manner as to form the prophetic Tau, the two Hebrew words so often found appended to t he Ineffable Name, and ALOHAYIM, or the Powers, and TSABAOTH, or the starry Armies and their guiding spirits; words also which symbolize the Equilibrium of the Forces of Nature and the Harmony of Numbers. To the three sides of the triangle belong the th ree great Names IAHAVEH, AD ONAI, and AGLA. Above the first is written in Latin, Formatio, above the second Reformatio, and above the third, Transformatio. So Creation is ascribed to the FATHER, Redemption or Reformation to the SON, and Sanctification or Transformation to the HOLY SPIRIT, answering unto the mathematical laws of Action, Reaction, and Equilibrium. IAHA VEH is also, in effect, the Genesis or Formation of dogma, by the elemen tary signification of the four letters of the Sacred Tetragram; ADONAI; is the realization of this dogma in the Human Form, in the Visible LORD, who is the Son of God or th e perfect Man; and AGLA (formed of the initials of the four words Ath Gebur Laulaim Adonai) expresses the sy nthesis of the whole dogma and the totality of the Ka bali.stic science, clearly indica ting by the hieroglyphics of which this admirable name is formed th e Triple Secret of the Great Work. Masonry, like all the Religions , all the Mysteries, Hermetic ism and Alchemy, conceals its secrets from all except the Adepts and Sages, or the Elect, and uses false explanations and misinterpretations of its symbols to mislead those w ho deserve only to be misled; to conceal the Truth, which it calls Light, from tl1em, and todraw them away from it. Truth is not for those who are unworthy or unable to receive it, or would pervert it. So God Himself incapacitates many men, by color-bli ndness, to distinguish colors, and leads the masses away from the highest Truth, giving them the power to attain only so much of it as it is profitable to them to know. Ever y age has had a religion suited to its capacity.

There is no sight under the sun more pitiful and ludicrous at once, than the spectacle of the Prestons a nd the Webbs, not to mention the later incarnations of Dullness and Commonplace, undertaking to \"e xplain\" the old symbols of Masonry, and adding to and \"improving\" them, or inventing new ones. To the Circle inclosing the central point, a nd itself traced between two parallel lines, a figure purely Kabalistic, these persons ha ve added the superimposed Bible, and even reared on that the ladder with three or nine rounds, and then given a vapid interpretation of the whole, so profoundly absurd as actually to excite admiration.

SECRET MASTER. MASONRY is a succession of al legories, the mere vehicles of great lessons in morality and philosophy. You will more fu lly appreciate its spirit, its object, its purposes, as you advance in the differen t Degrees, which you will find to co nstitute a great, complete, and harmonious system. If you have been disappointed in the first thre e Degrees, as you have received them, and if it has seemed to you that the performanc e has not come up to the promise, that the lessons of morality are not new, and the scient ific instruction is bu t rudimentary, and the symbols are imperfectly explained, remember that the ceremonies and lessons of those Degrees have been for ages more and more accommodating themselves, by curtailment and sinking into commonplace, to the often limited memory and capac ity of the Master and Instructor, and to the intellect and needs of the Pupil and Initiate; that they have come to us from an age when symbols were us ed, not to reveal but to conceal; when the commonest learning was confined to a select fe w, and the simplest prin ciples of morality seemed newly discovered truths ; and that these antique a nd simple Degrees now stand like the broken columns of a roofless Druidic temple, in their rude and mutilated greatness; in many parts, also, corrupted by time, and disfigured by modern additions and absurd interpretations. They are but the entrance to the great Masonic Temple, the triple columns of the portico. You have taken the first step over its threshol d, the first step toward the inner sanctuary and heart of the temple. You are in the path that leads up the slope of the mountain of Truth; and it depends upon your secrecy, obedience, and fidelity, whether you will advance or remain stationary. Imagine not that you will bec ome indeed a Mason by learni ng what is co mmonly called the \"work,\" or even by becoming familiar with our traditions. Masonry has a history, a literature, a philosophy. Its al legories and traditions will teac h you much; but much is to be sought elsewhere. The streams of lear ning that now flow full and broad must be followed to their heads in the springs that well up in the remote past, and you will there find the origin and meaning of Masonry. A few rudimentary lessons in architecture, a few universally admitted maxims of morality, a few unimportant traditions, whose real meaning is unkn own or misunderstood, will no longer satisfy the earnest inquirer after Masoni c truth. Let whoso is content with these, seek to climb no higher. He who desires to understand the harmonious and beautiful proportions of Freemasonry must read, study, reflect, dige st, and discriminate. The true Mason is an ardent seeker after knowl edge; and he knows that both books and the antique symbols of Masonry are vessels which come down to us full-freighted with the intellectual riches of the Past; and that in the lading of these argosies is much that sheds light on the history of Masonry, and proves its claim to be acknowledged the benefactor of mankind, born in the very cradle of the race. Knowledge is the most genuine and real of human treasures; for it is Light, as Ignorance"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"is Darkness. It is the development of the hum an soul, and its acquisit ion the growth of the soul, which at the birth of man knows nothing , and therefore, in one sense, may be said to be nothing. It is the se ed, which has in it the power to grow, to acquire, and by acquiring to be developed, as the seed is developed into the shoot, the plant, the tree. \"We need not pause at the common argument that by learning man excelleth man, in that wherein man excelleth beasts; that by learni ng man ascendeth to the heavens and their motions, where in body he cannot come, and the like. Let us rather regard the dignity and excellency of knowledge and learning in that whereunto man's nature doth most aspire, which is immortality or contin uance. For to this tendeth gener ation, and raising of Houses and Families; to this buildings, foundations, a nd monuments; to this tendeth the desire of memory, fame, and celebration, and in effect the strength of all other human desires.\" That our influences shall survive us, and be living forces when we are in our graves; and no merely that our names shall be remembered; but rather that our works shall be read, our acts spoken of, our names recollec ted an mentioned when we are dead, as evidences that those influences live and rule, sway and control some portion of mankind and of the world,--this is the aspiration of the human soul. \"We see then how far the monuments of genius and learning are more dur able than monuments of power or of the hands. For have not the verses of Homer co ntinued twenty-five hundred years or more, without the loss of a syllable or letter, during wh ich time infinite palace s, temples, castles, cities, have decayed and been demolished? It is no possible to have the true pictures or statues of Cyrus, Alexander Caesar, no, nor of the Kings or great personages of much late years; for the originals cannot last, and the copies ca nnot but lose of the life and truth. But the images of men's genius and knowledge remain in books, exempted from the wrong of time, and capable of perpetual renovation. Neither are they fitly to be called images, because they g enerate still, and cast their se eds in the minds of others, provoking and causing infinite actions and opi nions in succeeding ages; so that if the invention of the ship was thought so noble, wh ich carrieth riches and commodities from place to place, and consociateth the most re mote regions in participation of their fruits, how much more are letters to be magnified wh ich, as ships, pass through the vast seas of time, and make age so distant to par ticipate of the wisd om, illumination, and inventions, the on e of the other.\" To learn, to attain knowledge, to be wise, is a necessity for ever truly noble soul; to teach, to communicate that knowledge, to share that wisdom with others, and not churlishly to lock up his exchequer, and place a sentinel at the door to drive away the needy, is equally an impulse of a noble nature, and the worthies work of man. \"There was a little city,\" says the Preacher, the son of David \"and few men within it; and there came a great King against it and besieg ed it, and built great bulwarks against it. Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man. Then said I, wisdom is better than strength nevertheless, the poor man's wisdom is des pised, and his words are not heard.\" If it should chance to you, my brother, to do mankind good service, and be rewarded with indifference and forg etfulness only, still be not discouraged, but remember the further advice of the wise King. \"In the morning so w the seed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand; for thou knowest not which shall pros per, this or that, or whether both shall be alike good.\" Sow you the seed, whoever reaps. Learn, that you may be enabled to do good; and do so because it is right, find ing in the act itself ample reward and recompense. To attain the truth, and to serve our fellows , our country, and mankind-- this is the noblest destiny of man. Hereafter and all your life it is to be your object. If you desire to ascend to that destiny, advance! If you have other and less noble objects, and are contented with a lower flight, halt here ! le t others scale the heights, and Masonry fulfill her mission. If you will advance, gird up your loins for the struggle ! for the way is long and toilsome. Pleasure, all smiles, will beckon you on the one hand, and Indolence will invite you to sleep among the flowers, upon the other. Prepar e, by secrecy, obedience, and fidelity, to resist the allurements of both !"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Secrecy is indispensable in a Mason of whatever Degree. It is the first and almost the only lesson taught to the Entered Apprentic e. The obligations which we have each assumed toward every Mason that lives, requi ring of us the performance of the most serious and onerous duties toward those persona lly unknown to us until they demand our aid,-- duties that must be performed, even at the risk of life, or our solemn oaths be broken and violated, and we be branded as fa lse Masons and faithless men, teach us how profound a folly it would be to betray our se crets to those who, bound to us by no tie of common obligation, might, by obtaining th em, call on us in their extremity, when the urgency of the occasion should allow us no time for inquiry, and the peremptory mandate of our obligation compel us to do a brother's duty to a base impostor. The secrets of our brother, when communicated to us, must be sacred, if they be such as the law of our country warrants us to keep. We are required to keep none other, when the law that we are called on to obey is in deed a law, by having emanated from the only source of power, the People. Edicts which emanate from the mere arbitrary will of a despotic power, contrary to the law of God or the Great Law of Nature, destructive of the inherent rights of man, violat ive of the right of free though t, free speech, free conscience, it is lawful to rebel against and strive to abrogate. For obedience to the Law does not mean submis sion to tyranny nor that, by a profligate sacrifice of every noble feeling, we should offe r to despotism the hom age of adulation. As every new victim falls, we ma y lift our voice in still louder flattery. We may fall at the proud feet, we may beg, as a boon, the honour of kissing that bloody hand which has been lifted against the helpless. We may do more we may bring the altar and the sacrifice, and implore the God not to ascend too soon to Heaven. This we may do, for this we have the sad remembrance that beings of a human form and soul have done. But this is all we can do. We can constrain our tongues to be false, our features to bend themselves to the semblance of that passio nate adoration which we wish to express, our knees to fall prostr ate; but our heart we c annot constrain. There vi rtue must still have a voice which is not to be drowned by hymns and acclamations; there the crimes which we laud as virtues, are crimes still, and he whom we have made a God is the most contemptible of mankind; if, i ndeed, we do not feel, perhaps, that we are ourselves still more contemptible. But that law which is the fair expression of the will and judg ment of the people, is the enactment of the whole and of every individua l. Consistent with the law of God and the great law of nature, consistent with pure and ab stract right as tempered by necessity and the general interest, as contra-distinguished from the private interest of individuals, it is obligatory upon all, because it is the work of all, the will of all, the so lemn judgment of all, from which there is no appeal. In this Degree, my brother, you are especially to learn the duty of obedience to that law. There is one true and original law, conformable to reason and to nature, diffused over all, invariable, eternal, which calls to the fulfillment of duty and to abstinence fr om injustice, and calls with that irresist ible voice which is felt l in all it s authority wherever it is heard. This law cannot be abrogated or diminished, or its sanctions a ffected, by any law of man. A whole senate, a whole people, cannot dissent from its paramount obligation. It requires no commentator to render it di stinctly intelligible nor is it one thing at Ro me, another at Athens; one thing now, and another in the ages to come; but in all times and in all nations, it is, and has been, and will be, one and everlasting;-- one as that God, its great Author and Promulgator, who is the Common So vereign of all mankind, is Himself One. No man can disobey it without flying, as it were, from his own bosom, and repudiating his nature; and in this very act he will inflict on himself the severest of retributions, even though he escape what is regarded as punishment. It is our duty to obey the laws of our country , and to be careful that prejudice or passion, fancy or affection, error and illusion, be not mistaken for conscience. Nothing is more usual than to pretend conscience in all the actions of man which are public and cannot be concealed. The disobedient refuse to submit to the laws, and they also in many cases"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"pretend conscience; and so disobedience and rebellion be come conscience, in which there is neither knowledge nor revelation, no r truth nor charity, no r reason nor religion. Conscience is tied to laws. Right or sure c onscience is right reason reduced to practice, and conducting moral actions, while perverse conscience is seated in the fancy or affections--a heap of irregular principles and irregular defects-- and is the same in conscience as deformity is in the body, or peevishness in the affections. It is not enough that the conscience be taught by nature; but it must be taught by God, conducted by reason, made operative by discourse, assisted by choice, instructed by laws and sober principles; and then it is right, and it may be sure. All the general measures of justice, are the laws of God, and therefore they constitute the general rules of government for the conscience; but necessity also hath a large voice in the arrangement of human affairs, and the disposal of human re lations, and the dispositions of human laws; and these general measures, like a great river into little streams, are deduced into little rivulets and particularities, by the laws and customs, by the sentences and agreements of men, and by the absolute despotism of necessity, that will not allow perfect an d abstract justice and equity to be the sole rule of civil government in an imperfect world; and that must needs be law which is for the greates t good of the greatest number. When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it. It is better thou shouldest not vow than thou shouldest vow and not pay. Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter anything before God for Go d is in Heaven, and thou art upon earth; therefore let thy words be few. Weigh well what it is you promise; but once the promise and pledge are giv en remember that he who is false to his obligat ion will be false to his family, his friends, his country, and his God. Fides servailda est Faith plighted is ever to be kept, was a maxim and an axiom even among pagans. The virtuous Roman said, either let not that which seems expedient be base, or if it be base, let it not seem ex pedient. What is there which that so-called expediency can bring, so valuab le as that which it takes aw ay, if it deprives you of the name of a good man and robs you of your integrity and honour? In all ages, he who violates his plighted word has been held unspeakably base. The word of a Mason, like the word of a knight in the times of ch ivalry, once given must be sacred; and the judgment of his brothers, upon him who viol ates his pledge, shoul d be stern as the judgments of the Roman Censors against hi m who violated his oat h. Good faith is revered among Masons as it was among t he Romans, who placed its statue in the capitol, next to that of Jupiter Maximus Optimus; and we, like them, hold that calamity should always be chosen rather than basen ess; and with the knights of old, that one should always die rather than be dishonoured. Be faithful, therefore, to the promises you ma ke, to the pledges you give, and to the vows that you assume, since to break either is base and dishonourable. Be faithful to your family, and perform all the duties of a good father, a good son, a good husband, and a good brother. Be faithful to your frie nds; for true friendship is of a na ture not only to survive through all the vicissitudes of life, but to continue through an endless duration; not only to stand the shock of conflicting opinions, and the roar of a revolution that shakes the world, but to last when the heavens are no more, and to sp ring fresh from the ruins of the universe. Be faithful to your country, and prefer its dignity and honour to any degree of popularity and honour for yourself; consulting its interest rather than your own, and rather than the pleasure and gratification of t he people, which are often at variance with their welfare. Be faithful to Masonry, which is to be faithf ul to the best interests of mankind. Labour, by precept and example, to elevate the standard of Masonic character, to enlarge its sphere of influence, to popularize its teachings, and to make all men know it for the Great Apostle of Peace, Ha rmony, and Good-will on ear th among men; of Li berty, Equality, and"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Fraternity. Masonry is useful to all men to the learned, because it affords them the opportunity of exercising their talents upon subj ects eminently worthy of their attention; to the illiterate, because it offers them importan t instruction; to the young, because it presents them with salutary precepts and good examples, and ac customs them to reflect on the proper mode of living; to the man of the world, whom it furnishes with noble and useful recreation; to the traveller, whom it enabl es to find friends and brothers in countries where else he would be isolated and solitary; to the worthy man in misfortune, to whom it gives assistance; to the afflicted, on whom it lavishes consolation; to the charitable man, whom it enables to do more good, by uniti ng with those who are ch aritable like himself; and to all who have souls capable of appr eciating its importance, and of enjoying the charms of a friendship founded on the same principles of religion, morality, and philanthropy. A Freemason, therefore, should be a man of honour and of conscience, preferring his duty to everything beside, even to his lif e; independent in his opinions, and of good morals, submissive to the laws, devoted to hum anity, to his country, to his family; kind and indulgent to his brethren, friend of all vi rtuous men, and ready to assist his fellows by all means in his power.

V. PERFECT MASTER. The Master Khurum was an industrious and an honest man. What he was employed to do he did diligently, and he did it well and fait hfully. He received no wages that were not his due. Industry and honesty are the virtues peculiarly inculcated in this Degree. They are common and homely virtues; but not for t hat beneath our notice. As the bees do not love or respect the drones, so Masonry neither loves nor respects the idle and those who live by their wits; and least of all those par asitic acari that liv e upon themselves. For those who are indolent are likely to become dissipated and vicious ; and perfect honesty, which ought to be the common qualification of all, is more rare than diamonds. To do earnestly and steadily, and to do faithfully and honestly that which we have to do-- perhaps this wants but little, when looked at from every point of view, of including the whole body of the moral law; and even in their commonest and home liest application, these virtues belong to the character of a Perfect Master. Idleness is the burial of a living man. For an idle person is so useless to any purposes of God and man, that he is like one who is dead, unconcerned in the changes and necessities of the world; and he only lives to spend his time, and eat the fruits of the earth. Like a vermin or a wolf, when his ti me comes, he dies and perishes, and in the meantime is nought. He neither ploughs nor ca rries burdens: all that he does is either unprofitable or mischievous. It is a vast work that any man may do, if he never be idle: and it is a huge way that a man may go in virtue, if he never go out of his wa y by a vicious habit or a great crime: and he who perpetually reads good books, if his parts be answera ble, will have a huge stock of"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"knowledge. St. Ambrose, and from his example, St. August ine, divided every day into these tertias of employment: eight hours they spent in the necessities of nature and recreation: eight hours in charity, in doing assistance to others, dispatching their business, reconciling their enmities, reproving their vices, correc ting their errors, instru cting their ignorance, and in transacting the affairs of their dioces es; and the other eight hours they spent in study and prayer. We think, at the age of twenty, that life is much too long for that which we have to learn and do; and that there is an almost fabulous di stance between our age and that of our grandfather. But when, at the age of sixty, if we are fortunate enough to reach it, or unfortunate enough, as the case may be, and according as we have profitably invested or wasted our time, we halt, and look back along the way we have come, and cast up and endeavour to balance our accounts with time and opportunity, we find that we have made life much too short, and thrown away a huge portion of our time. Then we, in our mind, deduct from the sum total of our year s the hours that we have needlessly passed in sleep; the working-hours each day, during which the surface of the mind's sluggish pool has not been stirred or ruffied by a sing le thought; the days that we have gladly got rid of, to attain some real or fancied object that lay bey ond, in the way between us and which stood irksomely the inte rvening days; the hours wors e than wasted in follies and dissipation, or misspent in useless and unpr ofitable studies; and we acknowledge, with a sigh, that we could have learned and done, in half a score of years well spent, more than we have done in all our forty years of manhood. To learn and to do !--this is the soul's work here below. The soul grows as truly as an oak grows. As the tree takes the carbon of the ai r, the dew, the rain, and the light, and the food that the earth supplies to its roots, and by its mysterious chem istry transmutes them into sap and fibre, into wood and leaf, and fl ower and fruit, and colour and perfume, so the soul imbibes knowledge and by a divine al chemy changes what it learns into its own substance, and grows from within outwardl y with an inherent force and power like those that lie hidden in the grain of wheat. The soul hath its senses, like the body, that may be cultivat ed, enlarged, refined, as itself grows in stature and proportion; and he who ca nnot appreciate a fine painting or statue, a noble poem, a sweet harmony, a heroic though t, or a disinterested action, or to whom the wisdom of philosophy is but foolishness an d babble, and the lofti est truths of less importance than the price of stocks or cott on, or the elevation of baseness to once, merely lives on the level of commonplace, and fitly prides himself upon that inferiority of the soul's senses, which is t he inferiority and imperfect deve lopment of the soul itself. To sleep little, and to study much; to say little, and to hear and think much; to learn, that we may be able to do, and then to do, ear nestly and vigorously, whatever may be required of us by duty, and by the good of our fellows, our country, and mankind,-- these are the duties of every Mason who de sires to imitate the Master Khurum. The duty of a Mason as an honest man is pl ain and easy. It requires of us honesty in contracts, sincerity in arming, simplicity in bargaining, and faithfulness in performing. Lie not at all, neither in a little thing nor in a great, neither in the substance nor in the circumstance, neither in word nor deed: that is , pretend not what is false; cover not what is true; and let the measure of your affirm ation or denial be the understanding of your contractor; for he who deceives the buyer or the seller by speaking what is true, in a sense not intended or understood by the other, is a liar and a thief. A Perfect Master must avoid that which deceives, equally with that which is false. Let your prices be according to that measure of good and evil which is established in the fame and common accounts of the wisest a nd most merciful m en, skilled in that manufacture or commodity; and the gain such , which, without scandal, is allowed to persons in all the sa me circumstances. "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"In intercourse with others, do not do all wh ich thou mayest lawfully do; but keep something within thy power; and, because there is a latitude of gain in buying and selling, take not thou the utmost penny that is lawful, or which thou thinkest so; for although it be lawful, yet it is not safe; an d he who gains all that he can gain lawfully, this year, will possibly be tempted, next year, to gain something unlawfully. Let no man, for his own poverty, become mo re oppressing and cruel in his bargain; but quietly, modestly, diligently, and patiently recommend his estate to God, and follow his interest, and leave the success to Him. Detain not the wages of the hireling; for ever y degree of detention of it beyond the time, is injustice and unchar itableness, and grinds his face t ill tears and blood come out; but pay him exactly according to covenant, or according to his needs. Religiously keep all promises and covenants , though made to your disadvantage, though afterward you perceive you might have done better; and let not any precedent act of yours be altered by any after-accident. Let not hing make you break your promise, unless it be unlawful or impossible; that is, either out of your nature or out of your civil power, yourself being under the power of another; or that it be intolerably inconvenient to yourself, and of no advantage to another; or that you have leave expressed or reasonably presumed. Let no man take wages or fees for a work th at he cannot do, or cannot with probability undertake; or in some sense profitably, and with ease, or with advantage manage. Let no man appropriate to his own use, what God, by a special mercy, or the Republic, hath made common; for that is agai nst both Justice and Charity. That any man should be the worse for us, and fo r our direct act, and by our intention, is against the rule of equity, of justice, and of charity. We then do not that to others, which we would have done to ourselves; for we grow richer upon the ruins of their fortune. It is not honest to receive anything from another without returning him an equivalent therefor. The gamester who wins the money of another is dishonest. There should be no such thing as bets and gaming among Masons: for no honest man should desire that for nothing which belongs to another. The merchant who sells an inferior article for a sound price, the speculator who makes the distress es and needs of others fill his exchequer are neither fair nor honest, but base, ignoble, unfit for immortality. It should be the earnest desire of every Perfec t Master so to live and deal and act, that when it comes to him to die, he may be able to say, and his conscience to adjudge, that no man on earth is poorer, because he is richer; that what he hath he has honestly earned, and no man can go before God, a nd claim that by the rules of equity administered in His great chancery, this house in which we die, this land we devise to our heirs this money that enriches those who su rvive to bear our name, is his and not ours, and we in that forum are only hi s trustees. For it is most cert ain that God is just, and will sternly enforce every such trust; and that to all whom we despoil, to all whom we defraud, to all from whom we take or win anything what ever, without fair consideration and equivalent, He will decree a full and adequate compensation. Be careful, then, that thou receive no wages, here or elsewhere, that are not thy due ! For if thou doest, thou wrongst some one, by taking that which in God's chancery belongs to him; and whether that which thou takest thus be weal th, or rank, or influence, or reputation or affe ction, thou wilt surely be held to make full satisfaction.

You are especially taught in this Degree to be zealous and faithful; to be disinterested and benevolent; and to act the peacemaker , in case of dissensions, disputes, and quarrels among the brethren. Duty is the moral magnetism which controls and guides the true Mason's course over the tumultuous seas of life. Whether the stars of honour, reputation, and reward do or do not shine, in the light of day or in the darkness of the night of trouble and adversity, in calm or storm, that unerri ng magnet still shows him the true course to st eer, and indicates with certainty where-away lies the port which no t to reach involves shipwreck and dishonour. He follows its silent bidding, as the mariner, w hen land is for many days not in sight, and the ocean without path or landmark spreads out all around him, follows the bidding of the needle, never doubting that it points truly to the north. To perform that duty, whether the performance be rewarded or unrewarded, is his sole care. And it doth not matter, though of this performance there may be no witnesses, and th ough what he does will be forever unknown to all mankind. A little consideration will teach us that Fame has other lim its than mountai ns and oceans; and that he who places happiness in the fre quent repetition of his name, may spend his life in propagating it, without any danger of weeping for new worlds, or necessity of passing the Atlantic sea. If, therefore, he who imagines the world to be filled with his actions and praises, shall subduct from the number of his encomiasts a ll those who are placed below the flight of fame, and who hear in the valley of life no voice but that of nece ssity; all those who imagine themselves too important to regard him, and consider the mention of his name as a usurpation of their time; all who are too mu ch or too little pleased with themselves to attend to anything external; all who are attracte d by pleasure, or chained down by pain to unvaried ideas; all who are withheld from atte nding his triumph by different pursuits; and all who slumber in universal negligence; he will find his renown straitene d by nearer bounds than the rocks of Caucasus; and perc eive that no man can be venerable or formidable, but to a small part of his fellow -creatures. And therefore, that we may not languish in our endeavors after excellence, it is necessary that, as Africanus counsels his descendants, we raise our eyes to higher prospects, and contemplate our future and eternal state, without giving up our hearts to the praise of crowds, or fixing our hopes on such rewards as human power can bestow. We are not born for ourselves alone; and our country claims her s hare, and our friends their share of us. As all that the earth produce s is created for the us e of man, so men are created for the sake of men, that they may mutually do good to one another. In this we ought to take nature for our guide, and thro w into the public stoc k the ounces of general utility, by a reciprocation of duties; sometimes by receivi ng, sometimes by giving, and sometimes to cement human society by ar ts, by industry, and by our resources. Suffer others to be praised in thy presenc e, and entertain their good and glory with delight; but at no hand disparage them, or lessen the report, or make an objection; and think not the advancement of thy brother is a lessening of thy worth. Upbraid no man's weakness to him to discomfit him, neither re port it to disparage him, neither delight to remember it to lessen him, or to set th yself above him; nor ever praise thyself or dispraise any man else, unless some su fficient worthy end do hallow it. Remember that we usually disparage others u pon slight grounds and little instances; and if a man be highly recommended, we think him sufficiently lessened, if we can but charge one sin of folly or inferiority in his account. We should either be more severe to ourselves, or less so to others, and consider that whatsoever good any one can think or say of us, we can tell him of many unworth y and foolish and perhaps worse actions of ours, any one of which, done by another, w ould be enough, with us, to destroy his"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"reputation. If we think the people wise and sagacious, an d just and appreciative, when they praise and make idols of us, let us not call th em unlearned and ignoran t, and ill and stupid judges, when our neighbour is cried up by public fame and popular noises. Every man hath in his own life sins enough, in his own mind trouble enough, in his own fortunes evil enough, a nd in performance of his office s failings more than enough, to entertain his own inquiry; so that curiosity after the affairs of others can not be without envy and an ill mind. The gener ous man will be solicitous and inquisitive in to the beauty and order of a well-governed family, and afte r the virtues of an excellent person; but anything for which men keep locks and bars, or that blushes to see the light, or that is either shameful in manner or private in nature, this thing will not be his care and business. It should be objection sufficient to exclude an y man from the society of Masons, that he is not disinterested and generous, both in his acts, and in his opinions of men, and his constructions of their conduct. He who is selfish and grasping, or censorious and ungenerous, will not long remain within the st rict limits of honesty and truth, but will shortly commit injustice. He wh o loves himself too much must needs love others too little; and he who habitually gives harsh judgment will not long delay to give unjust judgment. The generous man is not careful to return no more than he receives; but prefers that the balances upon the ledgers of benefits shall be in his favour. He who hath received pay in full for all the benefits and favours that he has conferred, is like a spendthrift who has consumed his whole estate, and laments over an empty exchequer. He who requites my favours with ingratitude adds to, instead of diminishing, my wealth; and he who cannot return a favour is equally poor, whether hi s inability arises from poverty of spirit, sordidness of soul, or pecuniary indigence. If he is wealthy who hath large sums invested, and the mass of whose fortune consists in obligations that bind other men to pay him mone y, he is still more so to whom many owe large returns of kindnesses and favours. Be yond a moderate sum each year, the wealthy man merely invests his means: and that wh ich he never uses is still like favours unreturned and kindnesses unreciprocated, an actual and real portion of his fortune. Generosity and a liberal spirit make men to be humane and genial, open-hearted, frank, and sincere, earnest to do good, easy and c ontented, and well-wishers of mankind. They protect the feeble against the strong, and the defenceless against rapacity and craft. They succour and comfort the poor, and are t he guardians, under God, of his innocent and helpless wards. They value friends mo re than riches or fame, and gratitude more than money or power. They are noble by God's patent, and their escutcheons and quarterings are to be found in heaven's gr eat book of heraldry. Nor can any man any more be a Mason than he can be a gentle man, unless he is generous, liberal, and disinterested. To be liberal, but only of that which is our own; to be generous, but only when we have first been just; to give, when to give deprives us of a luxury or a comfort, this is Masonry indeed. He who is worldly, covetous, or sensual must change before he can be a good Mason. If we are governed by inclination and not by duty ; if we are unkind, severe, censorious, or injurious, in the relati ons or intercourse of life; if we are unfaithful parents or undutiful children; if we are harsh masters or faithles s servants; if we are treacherous friends or bad neighbours or bitter competitors or corrupt unprincipled politicians or overreaching dealers in business, we are wandering at a great distance from the true Masonic light. Masons must be kind and affe ctionate one to another. Fre quenting the same temples, kneeling at the same altars, they should fe el that respect and that kindness for each other, which their common relation and common approach to one God should inspire. There needs to be much more of the spirit of the ancient fellowship among us; more tenderness for each other's faults, more forg iveness, more solicitude for each other's"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"improvement and good fortune; somewhat of brot herly feeling, that it be not shame to use the word \"brother.\" Nothing should be allowed to interfere with that kindness and affection: neither the spirit of business, absorbing, eager, and overreachi ng, ungenerous and hard in its dealings, keen and bitter in its competit ions, low and sordid in its purposes; nor that of ambition, selfish, mercenary, restless, circ umventing, living only in the opinion of others, envious of the good fortune of others, miserably vain of its own success, unjust, unscrupulous, and slanderous. He that does me a favour, hath bound me to make him a return of thankfulness. The obligation comes not by covenant, nor by his ow n express intention; but by the nature of the thing; and is a duty springing up within the spirit of the obliged per son, to whom it is more natural to love his friend, and to do good for good, than to return evil for evil; because a man may forgive an injury, but he must never forget a good turn. He that refuses to do good to them whom he is bound to love, or to love that which did him good, is unnatural and monstrous in his affections, and thinks all the world born to minister to him; with a greediness worse th an that of the sea, which, al though it receives all rivers into itself, yet it furnishes t he clouds and springs with a retu rn of all they need. Our duty to those who are our benefact ors is, to esteem and love their persons, to make them proportionable returns of service, or duty, or profit, according as we can, or as they need, or as opportunity presents itself; and accord ing to the greatness of their kindnesses. The generous man cannot but regret to s ee dissensions and disputes among his brethren. Only the base and ungenerous delight in discord. It is the poorest occupation of humanity to labour to make men think worse of each other, as the press, and too commonly the pulpit, changing places with the hustings and the tribune, do. The duty of the Mason is to endeavour to make man think better of his neighbour; to quiet, instead of aggravating difficulties; to br ing together those who are se vered or estranged; to keep friends from becoming foes, and to persuade foes to become friends. To do this, he must needs control his own passions, and be not rash and hasty, nor swift to take offence, nor easy to be angered. For anger is a professed enemy to counsel. It is a direct storm, in which no man can be heard to speak or call from without; for if you counsel gently, you are disregarded; if you urge it and be vehement, you provoke it mo re. It is neither manly nor ingenuous. It makes marriage to be a necessary and unavoidable trouble; friendships and societies and familiarities, to be intolera ble. It multiplies the evils of drunkenness, and makes the levities of wine to run into madness. It make s innocent jesting to be the beginning of tragedies. It turns friendship into hatred; it makes a man lose himself, and his reason and his argument, in disputation. It turns the desires of knowledge into an itch of wrangling. It adds insolency to power. It turns justice in to cruelty, and judgment into oppression. It changes discipline into tediousness and ha tred of liberal institution. It makes a prosperous man to be envied, and the unfortunate to be unpitied. See, therefore, that first controlling your own temper, and governing your own passions, you fit yourself to keep peace and harm ony among other men, and especially the brethren. Above all remember that Masonr y is the realm of peace, and that \"among Masons there must be no dissens ion, but only that noble emul ation., which can best work and best agree.\" Wherever there is strife and hatred among the brethren, there is no Masonry; for Masonry is Peace, and Brotherly Love, and Concord. Masonry is the great Peace Soci ety of the world. Wherever it exists, it struggles to prevent international difficulties and dis putes; and to bind Republics, Kingdoms, and Empires together in one great band of peace and amity. It would not so often struggle in vain, if Masons knew their power and valued their oaths. Who can sum up the horrors and woes accumulated in a single war? Masonry is not dazzled with all its pomp and ci rcumstance, all its glitter and glory. War comes with its bloody hand into our very dwellings. It ta kes from ten thousand homes those who lived"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"there in peace and comfort, held by the tender ties of family and kindred. It drags them away, to die untended, of fever or exposure, in infectious climes; or to be hacked, torn, and mangled in the fierce fight; to fall on the gory field, to rise no more, or to be borne away, in awful agony, to noisome and horrid hos pitals. The groans of the battle-field are echoed in sighs of bereavement from thou sands of desolated hearths. There is a skeleton in every house, a vacant chair at every table. Returning, the soldier brings worse sorrow to his home, by the infection which he has caught, of camp-vices. The country is demoralized. The national mind is brought down, from the noble interchange of kind offices with another people, to wrath and revenge, and base pride, and the habit of measuring brute strength against brute strength, in battle. Treasures are expended, that would suffice to build ten thousand churches , hospitals, and universities, or rib and tie together a continent with rails of iron. If t hat treasure were sunk in the sea, it would be calamity enough; but it is put to worse use; fo r it is expended in cutting into the veins and arteries of human life, until the ea rth is deluged with a sea of blood. Such are the lessons of this Degree. You ha ve vowed to make them the rule, the law, and the guide of your life and conduct. If you do so, you will be entitl ed, because fitted, to advance in Masonry. If you do no t, you have already gone too far. VII. PROVOST AND JUDGE. THE lesson which this Degree inculcates is JUSTICE, in decision and judgment, and in our intercourse and dealing with other men. In a country where trial by jury is known, ever y intelligent man is liabl e to be called on to act as a judge, either of fact alone, or of fact and law mingled; and to assume the heavy responsibilities which be long to that character. Those who are invested with the power of judgment should judge the causes of all persons uprightly and impartially, without any personal consideration of the power of the mighty, or the bribe of the rich, or the needs of the poor. That is the cardinal rule, which no one will dispute; though many fail to observe it. But they must do more. They must divest themselves of prejudice and preconcept ion. They must hear patiently, remember accurately, and weigh carefully the facts a nd the arguments offered before them. They must not leap hastily to conclusions, nor form opinions before they have heard all. They must not presume crime or fraud. They mu st neither be ruled by stubborn pride of opinion, nor be too facile and yielding to t he views and arguments of others. In deducing the motive from the proven ac t, they must not assign to t he act either the best or the worst motives, but those which they would think it just and fair for the world to assign to it, if they themselves had done it; nor mu st they endeavour to make many little circumstances, that weigh nothing separately , weigh much together, to prove their own acuteness and sagacity. These are sound ru les for every juror, also, to observe. In our intercourse with others, there are two kinds of injustice: the firs t, of those who offer an injury; the second, of those who have it in their power to avert an injury from those to whom it is offered, and yet do it not. So active injustice may be done in two ways--by force and by fraud,--of which force is lion-like, and aud fox-like,--both utterly repugnant to social duty, but fraud the more detestable. Every wrong done by one man to another, whether it affect his person, his property, his happiness, or his reputation, is an offense ag ainst the law of justic e. The field of this Degree is therefore a wide and vast one; and Masonry seeks for the most impressive mode of enforcing the law of justice, and th e most effectual means of preventing wrong"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"and injustice. To this end it teaches this great and mom entous truth: that wr ong and injustice once done cannot be undone; but are eternal in their consequences; once committed, are numbered with the irrevocable Past; that the wrong that is done contains its own retributive penalty as surely and as natu rally as the acorn contains the oak. Its consequences are its punishment; it needs no other, and can have no heavier; they are involved in its commission, and cannot be separated from it. A wrong done to another is an injury done to our own Nature, an offence against our own souls, a disfiguring of the image of the Beautiful and Good. Punishment is not the execution of a sentence, but the occurrence of an effect. It is ordained to fo llow guilt, not by the dec ree of God as a judge, but by a law enacted by Him as the Creator and Legislator of the Universe. It is not an arbitrary and artificial annexation, but an or dinary and logical cons equence; and therefore must be borne by the wrong-doer, and through him may flow on to others. It is the decision of the infinite justice of God, in the form of law. There can be no interference with, or remittance of, or protection from , the natural effects of our wrongful acts. God w ill not interpose between the c ause and its co nsequence; and in that sense there can be no forgiveness of sins. The act which has debased our soul may be repented of, may be turned from; but the injury is done. The debasement may be redeemed by after-efforts, the stain obliterated by bitterer struggles and severer sufferings; but the efforts and the endurance wh ich might have raised the soul to the loftiest heights are now exhausted in merely regaining what it has lost. There must always be a wide difference between him wh o only ceases to do evil, and him who has always done well. He will certainly be a far more scrupulous wa tcher over his conduct, and far more careful of his deeds, who believes that those deeds will inevitably bear their natural consequences, exempt from after interventi on, than he who believes that penitence and pardon will at any time unlink the chain of sequenc es. Surely we shall do less wrong and injustice, if the conviction is fixed and embedded in our souls that everything done is done irrevocably, that even the Omnipo tence of God cannot un commit a deed, cannot make that undone which has been done; that ev ery act of ours must bear its allotted fruit, according to the everla sting laws, --must rema in forever ineffaceably inscribed on the tablets of Universal Nature. If you have wronged another, you may grieve, repent, and resolutely determine against any such weakness in futu re. You may, so far as it is poss ible, make reparation. It is well. The injured party may forgive you, according to the meaning of human language; but the deed is done; and all the powers of Nature, were they to conspire in your behalf, could not make it undone; the consequences to the body, the consequ ences to the soul, though no man may perceive them, are there, are written in the annals of the Past, and must reverberate throughout all time. Repentance for a wrong done, bears, like ever y other act, its own fruit, the fruit of purifying the heart and amending the Future, but not of effacing the Past. The commission of the wrong is an irrevocable act; but it does not incapacit ate the soul to do right for the future. Its consequences can not be expunged; but its course need not be pursued. Wrong and evil perpetrated, though ineffaceable, call for no despair, but for efforts more energetic than befo re. Repentance is still as valid as ever; but it is valid to secure the Future, not to obliterate the Past. Even the pulsations of the air, once set in motion by the human voice, cease not to exist with the sounds to which they gave rise. Thei r quickly-attenuated force soon becomes inaudible to human ears. But the waves of air thus raised perambulate the surface of earth and ocean, and in less than twenty hou rs, every atom of the atmosphere takes up the altered movement due to t hat infinitesimal portion of primitive motion which has been conveyed to it through countless channels, a nd which must continue to influence its path throughout its future existence. The air is one vast library, on whose pages is forever written all that man has ever said or even whispered. There, in their mutable, but"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"unerring characters, mixed with the earliest, as well as the latest signs of mortality, stand forever recorded, vows unr edeemed, promises unfulfille d; perpetuating, in the movements of each pa rticle, all in unison , the testimony of ma n's changeful will. God reads that book, though we cannot. So earth, air, and ocean are the eternal wit nesses of the acts that we have done. No motion impressed by natural causes or by hum an agency is ever obliterated. The track of every keel which has ever disturbed the su rface of the ocean rema ins forever registered in the future movements of all succeeding par ticles which may occu py its place. Every criminal is by the laws of the Almighty irre vocably chained to the testimony of his crime; for every atom of his mortal frame, through whatever changes its particles may migrate, will still retain, adhering to it through every combin ation, some movement derived from that very muscular effo rt by which the crime itself was perpetrated. What if our faculties should be so enhanced in a future life as to enable us to perceive and trace the ineffaceable consequences of our idle words and evil deeds, and render our remorse and grief as eternal as those co nsequences themselves? No more fearful punishment to a superio r intelligence can be c onceived, than to see still in action, with the consciousness that it must continue in ac tion forever, a cause of wrong put in motion by itself ages before. Masonry, by its teachings, endeavours to re strain men from the commission of injustice and acts of wrong and outrage. Though it does not endeavour to usurp the place of religion, still its code of mora ls proceeds upon other princi ples than the municipal law; and it condemns and punishes offences which neither that law punishes nor public opinion condemns. In the Masonic law, to chea t and overreach in trade, at the bar, in politics, are deemed no more venial than theft; nor a deliberate lie than perjury; nor slander than robbery; nor seduction than murder. Especially it condemns those wrongs of wh ich the doer induces another to partake. He may repent; he may, after ago nizing struggles, regain the path of virtue; his spirit may reachieve its purity through much anguish, after many strifes; but the weaker fellow- creature whom he led astray, whom he made a sharer in his guilt, but whom he cannot make a sharer in his repentance and amendment, whose downward course (the first step of which he taught) he cannot check, but is co mpelled to witness,-- what forgiveness of sins can avail him there? There is his perpetual, his inevitable punishment, which no repentance can alleviate, and no mercy can remit. Let us be just, also, in judging of other me n's motives. We know but little of the real merits or demerits of any fellow creature. We c an rarely say with certainty that this man is more guilty than that, or even that this man is very good or very wicked. Often the basest men leave behind them excellent reputations. There is scarcely one of us who has not, at some time in his life, been on the edge of th e commission of a crime. Every one of us can look back, and shuddering see the time when our feet stood upon the slippery crags that overhung the abyss of guilt; and when, if temptation had been a little more urgent, or a little longer continued, if pen ury had pressed us a little harder, or a little more wine had further disturbed our intellect, dethroned our judgment, and aroused our passions, our feet would have slipped, and we should have fallen, never to rise again. We may be able to say--\"This man has lied, has pilfered, has forged, has embezzled moneys intrusted to him; and that man has gone through life with clean hands.\" But we cannot say that the former has not struggled long, though unsuccessfully, against temptations under which the second would ha ve succumbed without an effort. We can say which has the cleanest hands before ma n; but not which has the cleanest soul before God. We may be able to say, this man has committed adultery, and that man has been ever chaste; but we cannot tell but t hat the innocence of one may have been due to the coldness of his heart, to the absence of a motive, to the presence of a fear, to the slight degree of the temptation; nor but that the fall of the other may have been preceded by the most vehement self-contest, caused by the most over-mastering frenzy, and atoned for by the most hallowing repentance. Generosity as well as niggardliness may be"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"a mere yielding to native temperament; and in the eye of Heaven, a long life of beneficence in one man may have cost less e ffort, and may indicate less virtue and less sacrifice of interest, than a few rare hidd en acts of kindness wrung by duty out of the reluctant and unsympathizing nature of the other. There may be more real merit, more self-sacrificing effort, more of the noblest el ements of moral grandeur, in a life of failure, sin, and shame, than in a career, to our eyes, of stai nless integrity. When we condemn or pity the fallen, how do we know that, tempted like him, we should not have fallen like him, as soon, and perhap s with less resistance ? How can we know what we should do if we were out of empl oyment, famine crouching, gaunt, and hungry, on our fireless hearth, and our children wailing for bread ? We fall not because we are not enough tempted! He that hath fallen ma y be at heart as honest as we. How do we know that our daughter, sister, wife, could resist the abandonment, the desolation, the distress, the temptation, th at sacrificed the virtue of their poor abandoned sister of shame? Perhaps they also have not fallen, be cause they have not been sorely tempted! Wisely are we directed to pray that we may not be exposed to temptation. Human justice must be ever uncertain. Ho w many judicial murders have been committed through ignorance of the phenomena of insanity ! How many men hung for murder who were no more murderers at heart than the jury that tried and the judge that sentenced them! It may well be doubted whether the adminis tration of human laws, in every country, is not one gigantic mass of injustice and wr ong. God seeth not as man seeth; and the most abandoned criminal, black as he is befor e the world, may yet have continued to keep some little light burning in a corner of his soul, which would long since have gone out in that of those who walk proudly in the sunshine of immaculate fame, if they had been tried and tempted like the poor outcast. We do not know even the outside life of m en. We are not competent to pronounce even on their deeds. We do not know half the acts of wickedness or virtue, even of our most immediate fellows. We cannot say, with certainty, even of ou r nearest friend, that he has not committed a particular sin, and broken a particular commandment. Let each man ask his own heart ! Of how many of our best and of our worst ac ts and qualities are our most intimate associates utterly unconscious ! How many virtues does not the world give us credit for, that we do not possess; or vices condemn us for, of which we are not the slaves ! It is but a small portion of our ev il deeds and thoughts that ever comes to light; and of our few redeeming goodnesses, the largest portion is known to God alone. We shall, therefore, be just in judging of other men, only when we are charitable; and we should assume the prerogative of judging ot hers only when the duty is forced upon us; since we are so almost certain to err, and the consequences of error are so serious. No man need covet the office of judge; for in as suming it he assumes the gravest and most oppressive responsibility. Yet you have assumed it; we all assume it; for man is ever ready to judge, and ever ready to condemn his neighbour, while upon the same state of case he acquits himself See, therefore, th at you exercise your once cautiously and charitably, lest, in passing judgment upon t he criminal, you commit a greater wrong than that for which you condemn him, and the c onsequences of which must be eternal. The faults and cr imes and follies of other men are not unimportant to us ; but form a part of our moral discipline. War and bloodshed at a distance, and frauds which do not affect our pecuniary interest, yet touch us in our fe elings, and concern our moral welfare. They have much to do with all thoughtful hear ts. The public eye may look unconcernedly on the miserable victim of vice, and that sha ttered wreck of a man may move the multitude to laughter or to scorn. But to the Mason, it is the form of sacred humanity that is before him; it is an erring fellow-being; a desolate, forlorn, forsaken s oul; and his thoughts, enfolding the poor wretch, will be far deeper than those of indiffe rence, ridicule, or contempt. All human offences, the whole system of dishonesty, evas ion, circumventing, forbidden indulgence, and intriguing ambiti on, in which men are struggling with each other, will be looked upon by a thoughtful Ma son, not merely as a scene of mean toils and strifes, but as the solemn conflicts of immortal minds, for e nds vast and momentous as their own being. It is a sad and unw orthy strife, and may well be viewed with"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"indignation; but that indignation must melt into pity. For the stakes for which these gamesters play are not thos e which they imagine, not t hose which are in sight. For example, this man plays for a petty once, a nd gains it; but the real stake he gains is sycophancy, uncharitableness, slander, and deceit. Good men are too proud of their goodness. Th ey are respectable; dishonour comes not near them; their countenance has weight a nd influence; their robes are unstained; the poisonous breath of calumny as never been br eathed upon their fair name. How easy it is for them to look down with scorn upon the poor degraded offender; to pass him by with a lofty step; to draw up the folds of their garment around them, that they may not be soiled by his touch ! Yet the Great Master of Virtue did not so; bu t descended to familiar intercourse with publicans and sinners, with the Samaritan woman, with the outcasts and the Pariahs of the Hebrew world. Many men think themselves better, in proporti on as they can detect sin in others! When they go over the catalogue of their neigh bour's unhappy derelictions of temper or conduct, they often, amidst much apparent concern, feel a secret exultation, that destroys all their own pretensions to wisdom and moderation, and even to virtue. Many even take actual pleasure in the sins of othe rs; and this is the case with every one whose thoughts are often employed in agreeable comparisons of his own virtues with his neighbours' faults. The power of gentleness is too little seen in the world; the subduing influences of pity, the might of love, the control of mildness over passion, t he commanding majesty of that perfect character which mingles grave displeasur e with grief and pity for the offender. So it is that a Mason should tr eat his brethren who go astray. Not with bitterness; nor yet with good-natured easiness, nor with worldl y indifference, nor with the philosophic coldness, nor with a laxity of conscience, th at accounts everything well, that passes under the seal of public opinion; but wit h charity, with pitying loving-kindness. The human heart will not bow willingly to what is infirm and wrong in human nature. If it yields to us, it must yield to what is divine in us. The wic kedness of my neighbour cannot submit to my wickedness; his sensuality, for instance, to my anger against his vices. My faults are not the instruments that are to arrest his faults. And therefore impatient reformers, and denouncing preachers, and hasty reprovers, and angry parents, and irritable relatives generally fa il, in their several departments, to reclaim the erring. A moral offence is sickness, pain, loss, dishonou r, in the immortal part of man. It is guilt, and misery added to guilt. It is itself calami ty; and brings upon itself, in addition, the calamity of God's disapprova l, the abhorrence of all virtuo us men, and the soul's own abhorrence. Deal faithfully, but patiently and tenderly, with this evil ! It is no matter for petty provocation, nor for personal strife, nor for selfish irritation. Speak kindly to your erring brother ! God piti es him: Christ has died for him: Providence waits for him: Heaven's mercy yearns towa rd him; and Heaven's spirits are ready to welcome him back with joy. Let your voice be in unison with all t hose powers that God is using for his recovery! If one defrauds you, and exults at it, he is the most to be pitied of human beings. He has done himself a far deeper injury than he has done you. It is he, an d not you, whom God regards with mingled displeasure and compassi on; and His judgment should be your law. Among all the benedictions of the Holy Mount there is not one for this man; but for the merciful, the peacemakers, and the pe rsecuted they are poured out freely. We are all men of like passions, propensities , and exposures. There are elements in us all, which might have been perverted, thro ugh the successive processes of moral deterioration, to the worst of crimes. The wretch whom the execration of the thronging crowd pursues to the scaffold, is not worse than any one of that multitude might have become under similar circumstances. He is to be condemned indeed, but also deeply to be pitied."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" It does not become the frail and sinful to be vindictive toward even the worst criminals. We owe much to the good Providence of God, ordaining for us a lot more favourable to virtue. We all had that within us, that might have been pushed to the same excess: Perhaps we should have fallen as he did, with less temptation. Perhaps we have done acts, that, in proportion to the temptation or provocation, were less excusable than his great crime. Silent pity and sorrow for the vi ctim should mingle with our detestation of the guilt. Even the pirate who murders in cold bl ood on the high seas, is such a man as you or I might have been. Orphanage in childhood, or base and dissolute and abandoned parents; an unfriended youth; evil companions; ignorance and wa nt of moral cultivation; the temptations of sinful pleasure or grindi ng poverty; familiarity with vice; a scorned and blighted name; seared and crushed affections ; desperate fortunes; t hese are steps that might have led any one among us to unfurl upon the high seas the bloody flag of universal defiance; to wage war with our kind; to live the life and die the death of the reckless and remorseless free-booter. Many affecting relationships of humanity plead with us to pity him. His head once rested on a mother's bosom. He was once the object of sisterly love and domestic endearment. Perh aps his hand, since often red with blood, once clasped another little loving hand at the altar. Pity him then; his blighted hopes and his crushed heart! It is proper that frail and erring creatures like us should do so; should feel the crime, but feel it as weak, tempted, and rescued creatures should. It may be that when God weighs men' s crimes, He will take into consi deration the temptations and the adverse circumstances that led to them, and the opportunities for moral culture of the offender; and it may be that our own offences will weigh heavier than we think, and the murderer's lighter than according to man's judgment. On all accounts, therefore, let the true Ma son never forget the solemn injunction, necessary to be observed at almost every moment of a busy life: 'JUDGE NOT, LEST YOU YOURSELVES BE JUDGED FOR WHAT SOEVER JUDGMENT YOU MEASURE UNTO OTHERS, THE SAME SHALL IN TURN BE MEASURED UNTO YOU. Such is the lesson taught the Provost and Judge. of man. VIII. INTENDANT OF THE BUILDING. IN this Degree you have been taught the impor tant lesson, that non e are entitled to advance in the Ancient and Accepted Sco ttish Rite, who have not by study and application made themselves familiar with Masonic learni ng and jurisp rudence. The Degrees of this Rite are not for those w ho are content with the mere work and ceremonies, and do not seek to explore the mines of wisdom that lie buried beneath the surface. You still advance toward the Light, toward that st ar, blazing in the distance, which is an emblem of the Divine Truth, gi ven by God to the first men, and preserved amid all the vicissitudes of ages in the tradit ions and teachings of Masonry. How far you will advance, depends upon yourself alone. Here, as everywhere in the world, Darkness struggles with Light, and clouds and sh adows intervene between you and the Truth. When you shall have become imbued with the morality of Masonry, with which you yet are, and for some time will be exclusively oc cupied,--when you sha ll have learned to practice all the virtues which it inculcates ; when they become familiar to you as your Household Gods; then will you be prepared to receive its lofty philosophical instruction, and to scale the heights upon whose summit Light and Truth sit enthr oned. Step by step men must advance toward Perfection; and ea ch Masonic Degree is meant to be one of those steps. Each is a development of a pa rticular duty; and in the present you are taught charity and benevolence; to be to your brethren an example of virtue; to correct"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"your own faults; and to endeavour to correct those of your brethren. Here, as in all the degrees, you meet with the emblems and the names of Deity, the true knowledge of whose character and attributes it has ever been a chief object of Masonry to perpetuate. To appreciate His infinite gr eatness and goodness, to rely implicitly upon His Providence, to revere and venerate Him as the Supreme Architect, Creator, and Legislator of the universe, is the first of Masonic duties. The Battery of this Degree, and the five circuits which you made around the Lodge, allude to the five points of fellowship, and are intended to recall them vividly to your mind. To go upon a brother's errand or to his relie f, even barefoot and upon flinty ground; to remember him in your supplications to the Deit y; to clasp him to your heart, and protect him against malice and evil speaking; to uphol d him when about to stumble and fall; and to give him prudent, honest, and friendly co unsel, are duties plainly written upon the pages of God's great code of law, and first among the ordinances of Masonry. The first sign of the Degree is expressive of the diffidence and humility with which we inquire into the nature and attributes of the Deity; the second, of the profound awe and reverence with which we contemplate His glorie s; and the third, of the sorrow with which we reflect upon our insufficient observance of our duties, and our imperfect compliance with His statutes. The distinguishing property of man is to search for and follow after truth. Therefore, when relaxed from our necessary cares and concerns, we then covet to see, to hear, and to learn somewhat; and we esteem knowledge of things, either obscure or wonderful, to be the indispensable means of living happily. Truth, Simplicity, and Candor are most agreeable to the nature of mankind. Whatever is virtuous consists either in Sagacity, and the perception of Truth; or in the preservati on of Human Society, by giving to every man his due, and observing the faith of contract s; or in the greatness and firmness of an elevated and unsubdued mind; or in observing or der and regularity in all our words and in all our actions; in which cons ist Moderation and Temperance. Masonry has in all times religiously preser ved that enlightened fa ith from which flow sublime Devotedness, the sentiment of Fraterni ty fruitful of good wo rks, the spirit of indulgence and peace, of sweet hopes and effectual cons olations; and inflexibility in the accomplishment of the most painful and arduou s duties. It has always propagated it with ardor and perseverance; and therefore it lab ours at the present day more zealously than ever. Scarcely a Masonic discourse is pr onounced, that does not demonstrate the necessity and advantages of this faith, and especially recall the two constitutive principles of religion, that make all religion,-- love of God, and love of neighbour. Masons carry these principles into the bosoms of their familie s and of society. While the Sectarians of former times enfeebled the religious spirit, Masonry, forming one great People over the whole globe, and marching under the great banner of Charity and Benevolence, preserves that religious feeling, strengthens it, extends it in its purity and simplicity, as it has always existed in the depths of the human heart, as it existed even under the dominion of the most ancient form s of worship, but wh ere gross and debasing superstitions forbade its recognition. A Masonic Lodge should resemble a bee-hive, in which all the members work together with ardor for the common good. Masonry is not made for cold souls and narrow minds, that do not comprehend its lofty mission and sublime apostolate. Here the anathema against lukewarm souls applies. To comfort misfortunes to popularize knowledge, to teach whatever is true and pure in religion and philosophy, to accustom men to respect order and the proprieties of life, to point out the way to genuine happiness, to prepare for that fortunate period, when all the factions of the Human Family, united by the bonds of Toleration and Fraternity, shall be but one h ousehold,--these are labours that may well excite zeal and even enthusiasm. We do not now enlarge upon or elaborate thes e ideas. We but utter them to you briefly, as hints, upon which you may at your leis ure reflect. Hereafter, if you continue to"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"advance, they will be unfolded, explained, and developed. Masonry utters no impracticable and extravagant precepts, certain, because they are so, to be disregarded. It asks of its initiates nothi ng that it is not possible and even easy for them to perform. Its teachings are eminently practical; and its stat utes can be obeyed by every just, upright, and honest man, no matter what his faith or creed. Its object is to attain the greatest practical good, without seeking to make men perfect. It does not meddle with the domain of religion, nor inquire into the mysteries of regeneration. It teaches those truths that are written by t he finger of God upon the heart of man, those views of duty which have been brought out by the meditations of t he studious, confirmed by the allegiance of the good and wise, and stamped as sterling by the response they find in every uncorrupted mind. It does not dogmatize, nor vainly imagine dogmatic certainty to be attainable. Masonry does not occupy itself with crying down this world, with its splendid beauty, its thrilling interests, its glorious works, its noble and holy affect ions; nor exhort us to detach our hearts from this earthly life, as empt y, fleeting, and unworthy, and fix them upon Heaven, as the only sphere deserving the love of the loving or the meditation of the wise. It teaches that man has high dutie s to perform, and a high destiny to fulfill, on this earth; that this world is not merely the portal to another; and that this life, though not our only one, is an integral one, and the particul ar one with which we are here meant to be concerned; that the Present is our scene of ac tion, and the Future fo r speculation and for trust; that man was sent upon the earth to live in it, to enjoy it, to st udy it, to love it, to embellish it, to make the most of it. It is his country, on which he should lavish his affections and his efforts. It is here his infl uences are to operate. It is his house, and not a tent; his home, and not merely a school. He is sent into this world, not to be constantly hankering after, dreaming of, preparing for another; but to do his duty and fulfill his destiny on this earth; to do all that lies in his power to improve it, to render it a scene of elevated happiness to himself, to those around hi m, to those who are to come after him. His life here is part of hi s immortality; and this world, also, is among the stars. And thus, Masonry teaches us, will man best pr epare for that Future which he hopes for. The Unseen cannot hold a higher place in our affections than the S een and the Familiar. The law of our being is Love of Life, and its interests and adornments; love of the world in which our lot is cast, engrossment with the inte rests and affections of earth. Not a low or sensual love, not love of wealth, of fame, of ease, of power, of splendour. Not low worldliness; but the love of Earth as the garden on which the Creator has lavished such miracles of beauty; as the habitation of hum anity, the arena of its conflicts, the scene of its illimitable progress, the dwelling-place of the wise, the good, the active, the loving, and the dear; the place of oppo rtunity for the development by means of sin and suffering and sorrow, of the noblest passions the loft iest virtues, and the tenderest sympathies. They take very unprofitable pains, who en deavour to persuade men that they are obliged wholly to despise this world, and all that is in it, even whilst they themselves live here. God hath not taken all that pains in forming and framing and furnishing and adorning the world, that they who were made by Him to live in it should despise it . It will be enough, if they do not love it too immoderately. It is useless to attempt to extinguish all those affections and passions which are and always will be inseparable fr om human nature. As long as he world lasts, and honour and virtue and industry have reputation in the world, there will be ambition and emulation and appet ite in the best an d most accomplished men in it; and if there were not, more ba rbarity and vice and wickedness would cover every nation of the world, than it now suffers under. Those only who feel a d eep interest in, and af fection for, this worl d, will work resolutely for its amelioration. Those who undervalue this rife, naturally become querulous and discontented, and lose their interest in the welf are of their fellows. To serve them, and so to do our duty as Masons, we must feel that the object is wort h the exertion; and be content with this world in which God has placed us, until He permits us to remove to a better one. He is here with us, and does not deem this an unworthy world. "},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"It a serious thing to defame and belie a whole world; to speak of it as the abode of a poor, toiling, drudging, ignoran t, contemptible race. You would not so discredit your family, your friendly circle, your village, your city, your country. The world is not a wretched and a worthless one; nor is it a misfor tune, but a thing to be thankful for, to be a man. If life is worthless, so also is immortality. In society itself, in that livi ng mechanism of human relationshi ps that spreads itself over the world, there is a finer essence within, th at as truly moves it, as any power, heavy or expansive, moves the sounding manufactory or the swift-flying car. The man-machine hurries to and fro upon the earth, stretches out its hands on every side, to toil, to barter, to unnumbered labours and enterprises; and al most always the motive, that which moves it, is something that ta kes hold of the comforts, affections , and hopes of social existence. True, the mechanism often works with difficu lty, drags heavily, grates and screams with harsh collision. True, the ess ence of finer motive, becomi ng intermixed with baser and coarser ingredients, often clogs, obstructs, jars, and deranges the free and noble action of social life. But he is neither grateful nor wise, who looks cynically on all this, and loses the fine sense of social good in its perversion s. That I can be a friend, that I can have a friend, though it were but one in the world; that fact, that wondrous good fortune, we may set against all the sufferings of our social natur e. That there is such a place on earth as a home, that resort and sanctuary of in-walle d and shielded joy, we may set against all the surrounding desolations of life. That one can be a true, social man, can speak his true thoughts, amidst all the Tanglings of contro versy and the warring of opinions; that fact from within, outweighs a ll facts from without. In the visible aspect and action of society, often repulsive and annoying, we are apt to lose the due sense of its invi sible blessings. As in Nature it is not the coarse and palpable, not soils and rains, nor even fields and flowers, that are so beautiful, as the invisible spirit of wisdom and beau ty that pervades it; so in soci ety, it is the invisible, and therefore unobserved, that is most beautiful. What nerves the arm of toil? If man minded himself alone, he would fling down the spade and axe, and rush to the desert; or roam through the world as a wilderness, and make that world a desert. His home, which he sees not, perhaps, but once or twice in a day, is the invisible bond of the world. It is the good, strong, and noble faith that men have in each other, which gives the lo ftiest character to business, trade, and commerce. Fraud occurs in the rush of business; but it is t he exception. Honesty is the rule; and all the frauds in the world cannot tear the great bond of human confidence . If they could, commerce would furl its sails on every sea, and all the cities of the world would crumble into ruins. The bare character of a man on t he other side of the wo rld, whom you never saw, whom you never will see, you hold good for a bond of thousands. The most striking feature of the political stat e is not governments, nor constitutions, nor laws, nor enactments, nor the judi cial power, nor the polic e; but the universal will of the people to be governed by the common weal. Take off that restraint, and no government on earth could stand for an hour. Of the many teachings of Masonry, one of the most valuable is, that we should not depreciate this life. It does not hold, that wh en we reflect on the destiny that awaits man on earth, we ought to bedew his cradle with our tears; but, like the Hebrews, it hails the birth of a child with joy, and holds th at his birthday should be a festival. It has no sympathy with those who profess to have proved this life, and found it little worth; who have deliberately made up their mi nds that it is far more miserable than happy; because its employment s are tedious, and their schemes often baffled, their friendships broken, or their friends dead, its pleasures pa lled, and its honours faded, and its paths beaten, familiar, and dull. Masonry deems it no mark of great piety towa rd God to disparage, if not despise, the state that He has ordained for us. It does not absurdly set up the claims of another world, not in comparison merely, but in competition, with the claims of th is. It looks upon both as parts of one system. It holds that a man may make the best of this world and of another"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"at the same time. It does not teach its in itiates to think better of other works and dispensations of God, by thinking meanly of these. It does not look upon life as so much time lost; nor regard its employments as trifle s unworthy of immortal beings; nor tell its followers to fold their arms, as if in disdain of their state and species; but it looks soberly and cheerfully upon the world, as a theatre of worthy action, of exalted usefulness, and of rational and innocent enjoyment. It holds that, with all its evils, life is a blessing. To deny that is to destroy the basis of all religion, natural and revealed. The very foundati on of all religion is laid on the firm belief that God is good; and if this life is an evil and a curse, no such belief can be rationally entertained. To level our satire at humanity and human existence, as mean and contemptible; to look on this world as the habitation of a miserable race, fit only for mockery and scorn; to consider this earth as a dungeon or a prison, which has no blessing to offer but escape from it, is to ex tinguish the primal light of faith and hope and happiness, to destroy the basis of religi on, and Truth's foundation in the goodness of God. If it indeed be so, then it matters not what else is true or not true; speculation is vain and faith is vain; and all that belongs to man' s highest being is buried in the ruins of misanthropy, melancholy, and despair. Our love of life; the tenacity with which, in sorrow and suffering, we cling to it; our attachment to our home, to the spot that ga ve us birth, to any place, however rude, unsightly, or barren, on which the history of our years has been written, all show how dear are the ties of kindred an d society. Misery makes a greater impression upon us than happiness; because the former is not the habit of our mind s. It is a strange, unusual guest, and we are more conscious of its presence. Happiness liv es with us, and we forget it. It does not excite us, nor disturb the order and course of our thoughts. A great agony is an epoch in our life. We remember our afflictions, as we do the storm and earthquake, because they are out of the common course of things. They are like disastrous events, recorded because ex traordinary; and with whole and unnoticed periods of prosperity between. We mark and signalize the times of calamity; but many happy days and unnoted periods of enjoyment pass, that ar e unrecorded either in the book of memory, or in the scanty annals of our thanksgiving. We are little disposed and less able to call up from the dim remembrances of our past years, the peaceful moments, the easy sensations, the bright thoughts, the qui et reveries, the throngs of kind affections in which life flowed on, bearing us almost un consciously upon its bosom, because it bore us calmly and gently. Life is not only good; bu t it has been glorious in the ex perience of millions . The glory of all human virtue clothes it. The splendours of devotedness, beneficence, and heroism are upon it; the crown of a thousand martyrdo ms is upon its brow. The brightness of the soul shines through this visible and sometimes darkened life; through all its surrounding cares and labours. The humblest life may feel its connection with its Infinite Source. There is something mighty in the frail inne r man; something of immortality in this momentary and transient being. The mind stretc hes away, on every side, into infinity. Its thoughts flash abroad, far into the boundless, the immeasurable, the infinite; far into the great, dark, teeming future; and become pow ers and influences in other ages. To know its wonderful Author, to bring down wisdom from the Eternal Stars, to bear upward its homage, gratitude, and love, to the Ruler of a ll worlds, to be immortal in our influences projected far into the slow-approaching Future, makes life most worthy and most glorious. Life is the wonderful creation of God. It is li ght, sprung from void darkness; power, waked from inertness and impotence; being created from nothing; and the contrast may well enkindle wonder and delight. It is a rill from the infinite, overflowing goodness; and from the moment when it first gushes up into the li ght, to that when it mingles with the ocean of Eternity, that Goodness attends it and mini sters to it. It is a great and glorious gift. There is gladness in its infant voices; jo y in the buoyant step of its youth; deep satisfaction in its strong maturity; and peace in its quiet age. There is good for the good; virtue for the faithful; and victory for the valiant. There is, even in this humble life, an infinity for those whose desires are boundless. There are blessi ngs upon its birth; there is"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"hope in its death; and eternity in its prospect. Thus earth, which binds many in chains, is to the Mason both the starting-place and goal of immortality, Many it buries in the rubbish of dull cares and wearying vanities; but to t he Mason it is the lofty mount of meditation, where Heaven, and Infinity and Eternity are spread before him and around him. To the lofty-minded, the pure, and the virtuous, this lif e is the beginning of Heaven, and a part of immortality. God hath appointed one remedy for all the evils in the world; and that is a contented spirit. We may be reconciled to poverty and a low fortune, if we suffer contentedness and equanimity to make the proportions. No man is poor who doth not think himself so; but if, in a full fortune, with impatience he desires more, he proclaims his wants and his beggarly condition. This virtue of cont entedness was the sum of all the old moral philosophy, and is of most universal use in the whole course of our lives, and the only instrument to ease the burdens of the world and the enmities of sad chances. It is the great reasonableness of complying with t he Divine Providence, which governs all the world, and hath so ordered us in the administra tion of His great family. It is fit that God should dispense His gifts as He pleases; an d if we murmur here, we may, at the next melancholy, be troubled that He did not make us to be angels or stars. We ourselves make our fortunes good or bad ; and when God lets loose a Tyrant upon us, or a sickness, or scorn, or a lessened fortune, if we fear to die, or know not how to be patient, or are proud, or covetous, then the ca lamity sits heavy on us. But if we know how to manage a noble principle, and fear not deat h so much as a dishonest action, and think impatience a worse evil than a fever, and pri de to be the greatest disgrace as well as the greatest folly, and pove rty far preferable to the torments of avarice, we may still bear an even mind and smile at the reverses of fortune and the ill-nature of Fate. If thou hast lost thy land, do not also lose thy constancy; and if thou must die sooner than others, or than thou didst expect, yet do not die impatiently. For no chance is evil to him who is content, and to a man nothing is miserable unless it be unreasonable. No man can make another man to be his slave, unless th at other hath first enslaved himself to life and death, to pleasure or pain, to hope or fear; command these passions, and you are freer than the Parthian Kings. When an enemy reproaches us, let us look on hi m as an impartial relator of our faults; for he will tell us truer than our fondest friend will, and we ma y forgive his anger, whilst we make use of the plainness of his declamation. The ox, when he is weary, treads truest; and if there be nothing else in abuse, but that it makes us to walk warily, and tread sure for fear of our enemies, that is better than to be flattered into pride and carelessness. If thou fallest from thy employment in public, take sanctuary in an honest retirement, being indifferent to thy gain abroad, or thy safety at home. When the north wind blows hard, and it rains sadly, we do not sit down in it and cry; but defend ourselves against it with a warm garment, or a good fire and a dry roof. So when the storm of a sad mischance beats upon our spirits, we may turn it into something that is good, if we resolve to make it so; and with equanimity and patience may shelter ourselves from its inclement pitiless pelting. If it develop our patience, and give occasion for heroic endurance, it hath done us good enough to recompense us sufficiently for all the temporal affliction; for so a wise man sha ll overrule his stars; and have a greater influence upon his own content, than all the constellations a nd planets of the firmament. Compare not thy condition with the few above thee, but to secure thy content, look upon those thousands with whom thou wouldst no t, for any interest, change thy fortune and condition. A soldier must no t think himself unprosperous, if he be not successful as Alexander or Wellington; nor any man deem himself unfortunate th at he hath not the wealth of Rothschild; but rather let the fo rmer rejoice that he is not lessened like the many generals who went down horse and man before Napoleon, and t he latter that he is not the beggar who, bareheaded in the blea k winter wind holds out his tattered hat for charity. There may be many who are richer and more fortunate; but many thousands who are very miserable, compared to thee."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" After the worst assaults of Fortune, ther e will be something left to us,--a merry countenance, a cheerful spirit, and a good co nscience, the Providence of God, our hopes of Heaven, our charity for those who have in jured us; perhaps a loving wife, and many friends to pity, and some to relieve us; and light and air, and all the beauties of Nature; we can read, discourse, and meditate; and having still these blessings, we should be much in love with sorrow and peevishness to lose them all, and prefer to sit down on our little handful of thorns. Enjoy the blessings of this day, if God send s them, and the evils of it bear patiently and calmly; for this day only is ours: we are dead to yesterday, and we are not yet born to the morrow. When our fortunes are violently ch anged, our spirits are unchanged, if they always stood in the suburbs and expectation of sorrows and revers es. The blessings of immunity, safeguard, liberty, and integrity dese rve the thanksgiving of a whole life. We are quit from a thousand calamities, every one of which, if it were upon us, would make us insensible of our present sorrow, and glad to receive it in exchange for that other greater affliction. Measure your desires by your fortune and cond ition, not your fortun es by your desires: be governed by your needs, not by your fancy; by nature, not by evil customs and ambitious principles. It is no evil to be poor, but to be vicious and impatient. Is that beast better, that hath two or three mountains to graze on, than the little bee that feeds on dew or manna, and lives upon what falls every mo rning from the store-houses of Heaven, clouds and Providence ? There are some instances of fortune and a fair condition that cannot stand with some others; but if you desire this, you must lose that, and unless you be content with one, you lose the comfort of both. If you covet learni ng, you must have leisure and a retired life; if honours of State and political distinctions, you must be ever abroad in public, and get experience, and do all men's business, and keep all company, and have no leisure at all. If you will be rich, you must be frugal; if you will be popular, you must be b ountiful; if a philosopher, you must despise riches. If y ou would be famous as Epaminondas, accept also his poverty, for it added lustre to his person, and envy to his fortune, and his virtue without it could not have been so excellent. If you would have the reputation of a martyr, you must needs accept his persecution; if of a benefactor of the world, the world's injustice; if truly gr eat, you must expect to see the mob prefer lesser men to yourself. God esteems it one of His glorie s, that He brings good out of evil; and therefore it were but reason we should trust Him to govern Hi s own world as He pleases; and that we should patiently wait until the change cometh, or the reason is discovered. A Mason's contentedness must by no means be a mere contented selfishness, like his who, comfortable himself, is in different to the discomfort of others. There will always be in this world wrongs to forgiv e, suffering to alleviate, sorrow asking for sympathy, necessities and destitution to relieve, and am ple occasion for the exercise of active charity and beneficence. And he who sits uncon cerned amidst it all, perhaps enjoying his own comforts and luxuries the more, by c ontrasting them with the hungry and ragged destitution and shivering misery of his fellows, is not conten ted, but selfish and unfeeling. It is the saddest of all sights upon this earth, that of a man lazy and luxurious, or hard and penurious, to whom want appeals in vain, and suffering cries in an unknown tongue. The man whose hasty anger hurries him into violence and crime is not half so unworthy to live. He is the faithless steward, that embezzles what God has given him in trust for the impoverished and suffering among his brethren. The true Mason must be and must have a right to be content with himself; and he can be so only when he lives not for himself alone, but for others also, who need his assistance and have a claim upon his sympathy. \"Charity is the great channel,\" it has been well said, \"through which God passes all His mercy upon mankind. For we receive absolution of our sins in proportion to our forgiving"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"our brother. This is the rule of our hopes and the measure of our desire in this world; and on the day of death and judgment, the great sentence upon mankind shall be transacted according to our alms, which is the other part of charity. God himself is love; and very degree of charity that dwells in us is the participation of the divine nature.\" These principles Masonry reduces to practice . By them it expects you to be hereafter guided and governed. It especially inculcates them upon him who employs the labour of others, forbidding him to discharge them, when to want employment is to starve; or to contract for the labour of man or woman at so low a price that by ov er-exertion they must sell him their blood and life at the same time with the labour of their hands. These Degrees are also intended to te ach more than morals. The symbols and ceremonies of Masonry have more than one m eaning. They rather conceal than disclose the Truth. They hint it only, at least; and their varied meanings are only to be discovered by reflection and study. Truth is not only symb olized by Light, but as the ray of light is separable into rays of different colours, so is truth separable into kinds. It is the province of Masonry to teach all truths--not moral truth alone, but political and philosophical, and even religious truth, so far as concerns t he great and essential principles of each. The sphynx was a symbol. To whom has it disc losed its inmost meaning? Who knows the symbolic meaning of the pyramids? You will hereafter learn who are the chief fo es of human liberty symbolized by the assassins of the Master Khurum; and in their fate you may see foreshadowed that which we earnestly hope will hereafte r overtake those enemies of humanity, against whom Masonry has struggled so long. IX. ELECT OF THE NINE. [Elu of the Nine.] ORIGINALLY created to reward fidelity, obedience, and devotion, this Degree was consecrated to bravery, devotedness, a nd patriotism; and your obligation has made known to you the duties which you have assumed. They are summed up in the simple mandate, \"Protect the oppressed against the oppressor; and devote yourself to the honour and interests of your Country.\" Masonry is not \"speculative,\" nor theoretical, but experime ntal; not sentimental, but practical. It requires self-renunciation and self -control. It wears a stern face toward men's vices, and interferes with many of our purs uits and our fancied pleasures. It penetrates beyond the region of vague sentiment; beyond the regions where moralizers and philosophers have woven their fi ne theories and elaborated thei r beautiful maxims, to the very depths of the heart, rebuking our li ttlenesses and meanness es, arraigning our prejudices and passions, and warring against the armies of our vices. It wars against the passions that spring out of the bosom of a world of fine sentiments, a world of admirable sayings a nd foul practices, of good maxims and bad deeds; whose darker passions are not only restrained by custom and ceremony, but hidden even from itself by a veil of beautiful sentiments. This terrible solecism has existed in all ages. Romish sentimentalism has often covered in fidelity and vice; Protestant straightness often lauds spirituality and faith, and neglec ts homely truth, candor, and generosity; and ultra-liberal Rationalistic refinement sometimes soars to heaven in its dreams, and wallows in the mire of earth in its deeds. There may be a world of Masonic sentiment; a nd yet a world of little or no Masonry. In"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"many minds there is a vague and general sent iment of Masonic char ity, generosity, and disinterestedness, but no practi cal, active virtue, nor habitual kindness, self sacrifice, or liberality. Masonry pla ys about them like the cold though brilliant lights that flush and eddy over Northern skies. There are occasi onal flashes of generous and manly feeling, transitory splendours, and momentary gleams of just and noble thought, and transient coruscations, that light the Heaven of their im agination; but there is no vital warmth in the heart; and it remains as cold and sterile as the Arctic or Anta rctic regions. They do nothing; they gain no victorie s over themselves; they make no progress; they are still in the Northeast corner of the Lodge, as when t hey first stood there as Apprentices; and they do not cultivate Masonry, with a cultiv ation, determined, resolute, and regular, like their cultivation of their estate, profession, or knowledge. Their Masonry takes its chance in general and inefficient sentiment, mournfu lly barren of results; in words and formulas and fine professions. Most men have sentiments, but not principles . The former are temporary sensations, the latter permanent and controlling impressi ons of goodness and virtue. The former are general and involuntary, and do not rise to the character of virtue . Every one feels them. They flash up spontaneously in every heart. T he latter are rules of action, and shape and control our conduct; and it is these that Masonry insists upon. We approve the right; but pursue the wrong. It is the old story of human deficiency. No one abets or praises injustice, fraud, op pression, covetousness, revenge, envy or slander; and yet how many who condemn these things, are themselves guilty of them. It is no rare thing for him whose indignation is ki ndled at a tale of wicked injustice, cruel oppression base slander, or misery inflic ted by unbridled indul gence; whose anger flames in behalf of the injured and ruined victim s of wrong; to be in some relation unjust, or oppressive, or envious, or self-indulge nt, or a careless talker of others. How wonderfully indignant the penurious man often is, at the avarice or want of public spirit of another! A great Preacher well said, \"Therefore thou ar t inexcusable. O Man, whosoever thou art, that judgest; for wherein thou judgest anot her, thou condemnest thyself: for thou that judgest, doest the same things.\" It is amaz ing to see how men can talk of virtue and honour, whose life denies both. It is curious to see with w hat a marvellous facility many bad men quote Scripture. It seems to comfort their evil consciences, to use good words; and to gloze over bad deeds with holy texts, wrested to their purpose. Often, the more a man talks about Charity and Toleration, the le ss he has of either; t he more he talks about Virtue, the smaller stock he has of it. T he mouth speaks out of the abundance of the heart; but often the very reverse of what the man practises. And the vicious and sensual often express, and in a sense feel, strong di sgust at vice and sensuality. Hypocrisy is not so common as is imagined. Here, in the Lodge, virtue and vice are matte rs of reflection and feeling only. There is little opportunity here, for the practice of ei ther; and Masons yield to the argument here, with facility and readiness ; because nothing is to follow. It is easy, and safe, here, too feel upon these matters. But to-morrow, w hen they breathe the atmosphere of worldly gains and competitions, and the passions are again stirred at the opportunities of unlawful pleasure, all their fi ne emotions about virtue, a ll their generous abhorrence of selfishness and sensuality, melt away like a morning cloud. For the time, their emotions and sentiments ar e sincere and real. Men may be really, in a certain way, interested in Ma sonry, while fatally deficient in virtue. It is not always hypocrisy. Men pray most fervently and sincerel y, and yet are constantly guilty of acts so bad and base, so ungenerous and unrighteous, t hat the crimes that crowd the dockets of our courts are scarcely worse. A man may be a good sort of man in general, and yet a very bad man in particular: good in the Lodge and bad in the world; good in public, and bad in his family; good at home, and bad on a journey or in a strange city . Many a man earnestly desires to be a good Mason. He says so, and is sincere. But if y ou require him to resist a certain passion, to"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"sacrifice a certain indulgence, to control his appetite at a par ticular feast, or to keep his temper in a dispute, you will find that he does not wish to be a good Mason, in that particular case; or, wishing, is not able to resist his worst impulses. The duties of life are more than life. The law imposeth it upon ev ery citizen, that he prefer the urgent service of his country before the safety of his life. If a man be commanded, saith a great writer, to bring ordnance or muni tion to relieve any of the King's towns that are distressed, then he cannot for any danger of tempest justify the throwing of them overboard; for there it holdeth which wa s spoken by the Roman, when the same necessity of weather was alleged to hold hi m from embarking: \"Necesse est ut eam, non ut vivam :\" it needs that I go: it is not necessary I should live. How ungratefully he slinks away, who dies , and does nothing to reflect a glory to Heaven ! How barren a tree he is, who lives, and spreads, and cumbers the ground, yet leaves not one seed, not one good work to gene rate another after him ! All cannot leave alike; yet all may leave something, answeri ng their proportions and their kinds. Those are dead and withered grains of corn, out of which there w ill not one ear spring. He will hardly find the way to Heaven, wh o desires to go thither alone. Industry is never wholly unfruit ful. If it bring not joy with the incoming profit, it will yet banish mischief from thy busied gates. There is a kind of good angel waiting upon Diligence that ever carries a l aurel in his hand to crown her . How unworthy was that man of the world who never did aught, but only liv ed and died! That we have liberty to do anything, we should account it a gift from the favouring Heavens; that we have minds sometimes inclining us to use that liberty well, is a great bounty of the Deity. Masonry is action, and not inertness. It requ ires its Initiates to WORK, actively and earnestly, for the benefit of their brethren, th eir country, and mankind. It is the patron of the oppressed, as it is the comforter and co nsoler of the unfortuna te and wretched. It seems to it a worthier honour to be the in strument of advancement and reform, than to enjoy all that rank and office and lofty titles can bestow. It is the advocate of the common people in those things which concern the be st interests of mankin d. It hates insolent power and impudent usurpation. It pities the poor, the sorrowing, the disconsolate; it endeavours to raise and improve the ig norant, the sunken, and the degraded. Its fidelity to its mission will be accurately ev idenced, by the extent of the efforts it employs, and the means it sets on foot, to improve the people at large and to better their condition; chiefest of which, within its reach, is to aid in the education of the children of the poor. An intelligent people, informed of its rights, will so on come to know its power, and cannot long be oppressed; but if ther e be not a sound and vi rtuous populace, the elaborate ornaments at the top of the pyrami d of society will be a wretched co mpensation for the want of solidity at the base. It is never safe for a nation to repose on the lap of ignorance: and if there ever was a time when public tran quillity was insured by the absence of knowledge, that season is past. Unthinking stupidity ca nnot sleep, without being appalled by phantoms and shaken by te rrors. The improvement of the mass of the people is the grand security for popular liberty ; in the neglect of which, the politeness, refinement, and knowledge accu mulated in the hi gher orders and weal thier classes will some day perish like dry grass in the hot fire of popular fury. It is not the mission of Masonry to engage in plots and conspiraci es against the civil government. It is not the fanatical propagandi st of any creed or theory; nor does it proclaim itself the enemy of kings. It is the apost le of liberty, equality, and fraternity; but it is no more the high-priest of republicanism th an of constitutional monarchy. It contracts no entangling alliances with any sect of theor ists, dreamers, or philo sophers. It does not know those as its Initiates who assail the civil order and all lawful authority, at the same time that they propose to deprive the dying of the consolations of re ligion. It sits apart from all sects and creeds, in its own calm and simple dignity, the same under every government. It is still that which it was in the cradle of the human race, when no human foot had trodden the soil of Assyria and Egypt, and no colonies had crossed the Himalayas into Southern India, Media, or Etruria."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" It gives no countenance to anarchy and licentiousness; a nd no illusion of glory, or extravagant emulation of the anc ients inflames it with an un natural thirst for ideal and Utopian liberty. It teaches that in rectitude of life and sobrie ty of habits is the only sure guarantee for the continuance of political freedo m, and it is chiefly the soldier of the sanctity of the laws and the rights of conscience. It recognizes it as a truth, that necessity, as well as abstract right and ideal justice, must have its part in the making of laws, the admin istration of affairs, and the regulation of relations in society. It sees, indeed, that nece ssity rules in all the af fairs of man. It knows that where any man, or any number or race of men, are so imbecile of intellect, so degraded, so incapable of self co ntrol, so inferior in the scal e of humanity, as to be unfit to be intrusted with the highes t prerogatives of citizenship, the great law of necessity, for the peace and safety of the community and country, requires them to remain under the control of those of larger intellect and superior wisdom. It trusts and believes that God will, in his own good time, work out his own great and wise purposes; and it is willing to wait, where it does not see its ow n way clear to some certain good. It hopes and longs for the day when all the races of men, even the lowest, will be elevated, and become fitted for political freedom; when, like all other ev ils that afflict the earth, pauperism, and bondage or abject dependence, shall cease and disappear. But it does not preach revolution to those who are fond of kings, nor rebellion that can end only in disaster and defeat, or in substituting one tyrant for an other, or a multitude of despots for one. Wherever a people is fit to be free and to govern itself, and generously strives to be so, there go all its sympathies. It detests the tyrant, the la wless oppressor, the military usurper, and him who abuses a lawful power . It frowns upon cruelty, and a wanton disregard of the rights of humanity. It abhors the selfish employer, and exerts its influence to lighten the burdens which wa nt and dependence impose upon the workman, and to foster that humanity and kindness which man owes to even the poorest and most unfortunate brother. It can never be employed, in any country under Heaven, to teach a toleration for cruelty, to weaken moral hatred for guilt, or to deprave and brutalize the human mind. The dread of punishment will never make a Mason an accomplice in so corrupting his countrymen, and a teacher of depravity and barbarity. If anywhere, as has heretofore happened, a tyrant should send a satirist on his tyranny to be convicted and punished as a libeller, in a court of justice, a Mason, if a juror in su ch a case, though in sight of the scaffold streaming with the blood of the innocent, and within hearing of the clash of the bayonets meant to overawe the court, woul d rescue the intrepid satirist from the tyrant's fangs, and send his officers out from the court with defeat and disgrace. Even if all law and liberty were trampled und er the feet of Jacobinical demagogues or a military banditti, and great crimes were perpet rated with a high hand against all who were deservedly the objects of public veneration; if the people, overthrowing law, roared like a sea around the courts of just ice, and demanded the blood of those who, during the temporary fit of insanity and drunken deliriu m, had chanced to become odious to it, for true words manfully spoken, or unpopular ac ts bravely done, the Masonic juror, unawed alike by the single or the many-headed tyran t, would consult the dictates of duty alone, and stand with a noble firmness between t he human tigers and their coveted prey. The Mason would much rather pass his lif e hidden in the recesses of the deepest obscurity, feeding his mind even with t he visions and imaginations of good deeds and noble actions, than to be placed on the most splendid throne of the universe, tantalized with a denial of the practice of all which c an make the greatest si tuation any other than the greatest curse. And if he has been enabled to lend the slightest step to any great and laudable designs; if he has had any share in an y measure giving quiet to private property and to private conscience, making lighter the yoke of poverty and dependence, or relieving deserving men from oppression; if he has aided in securing to his countrymen"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"that best possession, peace; if he has joined in reconciling the diffe rent sections of his own country to each other, and the people to the government of their own creating; and in teaching the citizen to look for his protec tion to the laws of his country, and for his comfort to the good-will of his countrymen; if he has thus taken his part with the best of men in the best of their actions, he may well s hut the book, even if he might wish to read a page or two more. It is enough for his measure. He has not lived in vain. Masonry teaches that all power is delegated for the good, an d not for the injury of the People; and that, when it is perverted from t he original purpose, the compact is broken, and the right ought to be resumed; that resist ance to power usurped is not merely a duty which man owes to himself and to his neighbo ur, but a duty which he owes to his God, in asserting and maintaining the rank which He gave him in the creation. This principle neither the rudeness of ignorance can stifle no r the enervation of refi nement extinguish. It makes it base for a man to suffer when he ought to act; and, tending to preserve to him the original destinations of Providence, spurns at the arrogant assumptions of tyrants and vindicates the independent quality of the race of which we are a part. The wise and well-informe d Mason will not fail to be the vota ry of Liberty and Justice. He will be ready to exert himself in their defence, wherever they exist. It canno t be a matter of indifference to him when, his own liberty an d that of other men, with whose merits and capacities he is acquainted, are involved in th e event of the struggle to be made; but his attachment will be to the caus e, as the cause of man; and not mere ly to the country. Wherever there is a people that understands th e value of political justice, and is prepared to assert it, that is his country; wherever he can most contribute to the diffusion of these principles and the real happiness of mankind, that is his coun try. Nor does he desire for any country any other benefit than justice. The true Mason identifies the honour of his country with his own. Nothing more conduces to the beauty and glory of one's country than the preservation against all enemies of its civil and religious liber ty. The world will never willingly le t die the names of those patriots who in her different ages have received upon their own breasts the blows aimed by insolent enemies at the bos om of their country. But also it conduces, and in no small meas ure, to the beauty and glory of one's country, that justice should always be administered th ere to all alike, and neither denied, sold, nor delayed to any one; that the interest of the p oor should be looked to, and none starve or be houseless, or clamor in vain for work; that the child and the feeble woman should not be overworked, or even the apprentice or sl ave be stinted of food or overtasked or mercilessly scourged; and that God's great laws of mercy, humanity, and compassion should be everywhere enforced, not only by t he statutes, but also by the power of public opinion. And he who labours, often against reproach and obloquy, and oftener against indifference and apathy, to bring about that fo rtunate condition of things when that great code of divine law shall be everywhere and punc tually obeyed, is no less a patriot than he who bares his bosom to the hostile stee l in the ranks of his country's soldiery. For fortitude is not only seen resplendent on the field of battle and amid the clash of arms, but he displays its energy under ever y difficulty and against every assailant. He who wars against cruelty, oppression, and hoa ry abuses, fights for his country's honour, which these things soil; and her honour is as important as her existe nce. Often, indeed, the warfare against those abuses which disgra ce one's country is quite as hazardous and more discouraging than that against her enemie s in the field; and merits equal, if not greater reward. For those Greeks and Romans who are the ob jects of our admiration employed hardly any other virtue in the extirpation of tyrants, than that love of liberty, which made them prompt in seizing the sword, and gave them strength to use it. With facility they accomplish the undertaking, amid the general shout of praise and joy; nor did they engage in the attempt so much as an enterpri se of perilous and doubtful issue, as a contest the most glorious in which virtue could be signalized; which infallibly led to present recompense; which bound their brows with wreaths of laurel, and consigned their"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"memories to immortal fame. But he who assails hoary abuses, regarded pe rhaps with a superstitious reverence, and around which old laws stand as ramparts and bastions to defend them; who denounces acts of cruelty and outrage on humanity which make every perpetrator thereof his personal enemy, and perhaps make him lo oked upon with suspicion by the people among whom he lives, as the assailant of an established order of things of which he assails only the abuses, and of laws of wh ich he attacks only the violations,--he can scarcely look for present recompense, nor that his living brow s will be wreathed with laurel. And if, contending against a dark arra y of long-received opinions, superstitions, obloquy, and fears, which most men dre ad more than they do an army terrible with banners, the Mason overcomes, and emerges fr om the contest victorious; or if he does not conquer, but is borne down and swept away by the mighty current of prejudice, passion, and interest; in either case, the loftiness of spirit which he displays merits for him more than a mediocrity of fame. e has already lived too long who has survived the ruin of his country; and he who can enjoy life after such an event deserves not to have lived at all. Nor does he any more deserve to live who looks contentedly upon a buses that disgrace, and cruelties that dishonour, and scenes of misery and destituti on and brutalization that disfigure his country; or sordid meanness and ignoble rev enges that make her a by-word and a scoff among all generous nations; and does not e ndeavour to remedy or prevent either. Not often is a country at war; nor can every one be allowed the privilege of offering his heart to the enemy's bullets. But in these patriotic labours of p eace, in preventing, remedying, and reforming evil s, oppressions, wrongs, cruelties, and outrages, every Mason can unite; and every one can effect some thing, and share the honour and glory of the result. For the cardinal names in the history of th e human mind are few and easily to be counted up; but thousands and tens of thousands spen d their days in the preparations which are to speed the predestined change, in gatheri ng and amassing the materials which are to kindle and give light and warmth, when the fire from heaven shall have descended on them. Numberless are the sutlers and pioneer s, the engineers and artisans, who attend the march of intellect. Many move forward in detachments, and level the way over which the chariot is to pass, and cut down the ob stacles that would impede its progress; and these too have their reward. If they labour diligen tly and faithfully in their calling, not only will they enjoy that calm cont entment which diligence in the lowliest task ne ver fails to win; not only will the sweat of their brows be sweet, and the sweetener of t he rest that follows; but, when the victory is at last achieved, they will come in for a share in the glory; even as the meanest soldier who fought at Marathon or at King's Mountain became a sharer in the glory of those saving da ys; and within his own household circle, the approbation of which approaches the nearest to that of an approving conscience, was looked upon as the representativ e of all his brother-heroes; and could tell such tales as made the tear glisten on the cheek of his wife, and ]it up his boy'.s eyes with an unwonted sparkling eagerness. Or, if he fell in the fight, and his place by the fireside and at the table at home was thereafter vacant, that place was sacred; and he was often talked of there in the long winter evenings; and his family was deemed fortunate in the neighbourhood, because it had had a hero in it , who had fallen in defence of his country. Remember that life's length is not measured by its hours and days bu t by that which we have done therein for our country and kind. A usel ess life is short. if it last a century; but that of Alexander was long as the life of the oak, though he died at thirty-five. We may do much in a few years, and we may nothing in a lifetime. If we but eat and drink and sleep, and everything go on around us as it pleases ; or if we live but amass wealth or gain office or wear titles, we might as well not have lived at all; nor have we any right to expect immortality.

ILLUSTRIOUS ELECT OF THE FIFTEEN. [Elu of the Fifteen ] THIS Degree is devoted to the same obj ects as those of the Elu of Nine; and also to the cause of Toleration and Liberality against Fanaticism and Persecution, political and religious; and to that of Education, Instruction, and Enlightenment against Error, Barbarism, and Ignorance. To these objects you have irrevocably and fore ver devoted your hand, your heart, and your intellect; and whenever in your presence a Chapter of this Degree is opened, you will be most solemnly remind ed of your vows here taken at the altar. Toleration, holding that every other ma n has the same right to his opinion and faith that we have to ours; and liberality, holding that as no human being can with certainty say, in the cl ash and conflict of hostile faiths and creeds, what is truth, or that he is su rely in possession of it, so every one should feel that it is quite possible that another equally honest and sincere with himself, and yet hold ing the contrary opinion, may himself be in possession of the truth, and that whatever one fi rmly and conscientiously believes, is truth, to him - these ar e the mortal enemies of that fanaticism which persecutes for opinion's sake , and initiates crusades against whatever it, in its imaginary holiness, deems to be contrary to the law of God or verity of dogma. And education, instruction, and enlightenment are the most certain means by which fanaticism and intolerance can be rendered powerless. No true Mason scoffs at honest c onvictions and an ardent zeal in the cause of what one believes to be truth and justice. But he does absolutely deny the right of any man to assume the prerogative of Deity, and condemn another's faith and opinions as deserving to be punished because heretical. Nor does he approve the course of those who endanger the peace and quiet of great nations, and the best interest of their own race by indulging in a chim erical and visionary philanthropy - a luxury which chiefly consists in draw ing their robes around them to avoid contact with their fellows, and procla iming themselves holier than they. For he knows that such follies are o ften more calamitous than the ambition of kings; and that intolerance and bigotry have been infinitely greater curses to mankind than ignorance and error. Better any error than persecution! Better any opinion than the thumb-screw, the rack, and the stake! And he knows also how unspeakably absurd it is, for a creature to whom himself and everything around hi m are mysteries, to torture and slay others, because they cannot thin k as he does in regard to the profoundest of those mysteries, to understand which is utterly beyond the comprehension of either the per secutor or the persecuted. Masonry is not a religion. He who makes of it a re ligious belief, falsifies and denaturalizes it. The Brahmin, the Jew, the Mahometan, the Catholic, the Protestant, each professing his peculiar religion, sanctioned by the laws, by time, and by climate, must needs retain it, and cannot have two religions; for the social and sacred laws adapted to the usages, manners, and prejudices of particular co untries, are the work of men."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"But Masonry teaches, and has preserved in their purity, the cardinal tenets of the old primitive faith, which underlie and are the foundation of all religions. All that ever existed have had a basis of truth; and all have overlaid that truth with errors. The pr imitive truths taught by the Redeemer were sooner corrupted, and intermingl ed and alloyed with fictions than when taught to the first of our race. Masonry is the universal morality which is suitable to the inhabitants of every clime, to the man of every creed. It has taught no doctrines, except those truths that tend directly to the well-being of man; and those who have attempted to direct it toward useless vengeance, political ends, and Jesuitism, have merely perverted it to purposes foreign to its pure spirit and real nature. Mankind outgrows the sacrifices and the mythologies of the childhood of the world. Yet it is easy for human indolence to linger near these helps, and refuse to pass further on. So the unadventurous Nomad in the Tartarian wild keeps his flock in the same close-cropped circle where they first learned to browse, while the progressive man roves ever forth \"t o fresh fields and pastures new.\" The latter is the true Mason; and the best and indeed the only good Mason is he who with the power of bus iness does the work of life; the upright mechanic, merchant, or farmer , the man with the power of thought, of justice, or of love, he whose whol e life is one great act of performance of Masonic duty. The natural case of the strength of a strong man or the wisdom of a wise one, is to do the work of a strong man or a wise one. The natural work of Masonry is practica l life; the use of all the faculties in their proper spheres, and for their natura l function. Love of Truth, justice, and generosity as attributes of God, must appear in a life marked by these qualities; that is the on ly effectual ordinance of Masonry. A profession of one's convictions, joining the Order, as suming the obligations, assisting at the ceremonies, are of the same valu e in science as in Masonry; the natural form of Masonry is goodnes s, morality, living a true, just, affectionate, self-faithful life, from th e motive of a good man. It is loyal obedience to God's law. The good Mason does the good thing which comes in his way, and because it comes in his way; from a love of duty, and not merely because a law, enacted by man or God, commands his will to do it. He is true to his mind, his conscience, heart, and soul , and feels small temptation to do to others what he would not wish to re ceive from them. He will deny himself for the sake of his brother near at han d. His desire attracts in the line of his duty, both being in conjunction. Not in vain does the poor or the oppressed look up to him. You find such men in all Christian sects, Protestant and Cat holic, in all the great religio us parties of the civilized world, among Buddhists, Mahometans, and Jews. They are kind fathers, generous citizens, unimpeachable in thei r business, beautiful in their daily lives. You see their Masonry in their work and in their play. It appears in all the forms of their activity, individual , domestic, social, ecclesiastical, or political. True Masonry within must be morality without. It must become eminent morality, which is philanthropy. The true Mason loves not only his kindred and his country, but all mankind; not only the good, but also the evil, among his brethren. He has more goodness than the channels of his daily life will hol d. It runs over the banks, to water and to feed a thousand thirsty plants . Not content with the duty that lies along his track, he goes out to seek it; not only willing, he has a salient longing to do good, to spread his tr uth, his justice, his generosity, his Masonry over all the world. His daily life is a profession of his Masonry, published in perpetual good-will to men. He c an not be a persecutor. Not more naturally does the beaver bu ild or the mocking-bird sing his own wild, gushing melody, than the true Mason lives in this beautiful outward life. So from the perennial spring swe lls forth the stream, to quicken the meadow with new access of green, and perfect beauty bursting into bloom. Thus Masonry does the work it was meant to do. The Mason does"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"not sigh and weep, and make grimaces. He lives right on. If his life is, as whose is not, marked with errors, a nd with sins, he ploughs over the barren spot with his remorse, sows with new seed, and the old desert blossoms like a rose. He is not confin ed to set forms of thought, of action, or of feeling. He accepts what his mind regards as true, what his conscience decides is right, what his heart deems generous and noble; and all else he puts far from him. Th ough the ancient and the honorable of the Earth bid him bow down to them, his stubborn knees bend only at the bidding of his manly soul. His Masonry is his freedom before God, not his bondage unto men. His mind acts afte r the universal law of the intellect, his conscience according to the universa l moral law, his affections and his soul after the universal law of each, and so he is strong with the strength of God, in this four-fold way communicating with Him. The old theologies, the philosophies of religion of ancient times, will not suffice us now. The duties of life are to be done; we are to do them, consciously obedient to the law of G od, not atheistically, loving only our selfish gain. There are sins of trade to be corrected. Everywhere morality and philanthropy are needed. There are errors to be made way with, and their place supplied with new truths, radiant with the glories of Heaven. There are great wrongs and evils, in Church and State, in domestic, social, and public life, to be righted and outgrown. Masonry cannot in our age forsake the broad way of life. She must journey on in the open street, appear in the crowded square, and te ach men by her deeds, her life more eloquent than any lips. This Degree is chiefly devoted to TOLE RATION; and it inculcates in the strongest manner that great leading idea of the Ancient Art, that a belief in the one True God, and a moral and vi rtuous life, constitute the only religious requisites needed to enable a man to be a Mason. Masonry has ever the most vivid rememb rance of the terrible and artificial torments that were used to put down new forms of religion or extinguish the old. It sees with the eye of memory the ruthless extermination of all the people of all sexes and ages, because it was their misfortune not to know the God of the Hebrews, or to wors hip Him under the wrong name, by the savage troops of Moses and Joshua. It sees the thumb-screws and the racks, the whip, the gallows, and the stake, the victims of Diocletian and Alva, the miserable Covenanters, the Non-Conformists, Servetus burned, and the unoffending Quak er hung. It sees Cranmer hold his arm, now no longer erring, in the flame until the hand drops off in the consuming heat. It sees the persecutions of Peter and Paul, the martyrdom of Stephen, the trials of Ignatius, Polycarp, Justin , and Irenæus; and then in turn the sufferings of the wretched Pagans unde r the Christian Emperors, as of the Papists in Ireland and under Elizabet h and the bloated Henry. The Roman Virgin naked before the hungry lions; young Margaret Graham tied to a stake at low-water mark, and there left to drown, singing hymns to God until the savage waters broke over he r head; and all that in all ages have suffered by hunger and nakedness, peril and prison, the rack, the stake, and the sword, - it sees them all, and shudders at the long roll of human atrocities. And it sees also the oppr ession still practis ed in the name of religion - men shot in a Christian jail in Christian Italy for reading the Christian Bible; in almost every Christ ian State, laws forbidding freedom of speech on matters relating to Christianity; and the gallows reaching its arm over the pulpit. The fires of Moloch in Syria, the hars h mutilations in the name of Astarte, Cybele, Jehovah; the barbarities of im perial Pagan Torturers; the still grosser torments which Roman-Gothic Christians in Italy and Spain heaped on their brother-men; the fiendish cruelties to which Switzerland, France, the Netherlands, England, Scot land, Ireland, America, have been witnesses, are none too powerful to warn man of the unspeakable evils which follow from mistakes and errors in the matter of religion, and especially from"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"investing the God of Love with the cr uel and vindictive passions of erring humanity, and making blood to have a sweet savor in his nostrils, and groans of agony to be delicious to his ears. Man never had the right to usurp the une xercised prerogative of God, and condemn and punish another for his belie f. Born in a Protestant land, we are of that faith. If we had opened our eyes to the light under the shadows of St. Peter's at Rome, we should hav e been devout Catholics; born in the Jewish quarter of Aleppo, we shoul d have contemned Christ as an imposter; in Constantinople, we shou ld have cried \"Allah il Allah, God is great and Mahomet is his prophet!\" Birt h, place, and educ ation give us our faith. Few believe in any religion because they have examined the evidences of its authenticity, and made up a formal judgment, upon weighing the testimony. Not one ma n in ten thousa nd knows anything about the proofs of his faith. We belie ve what we are taught; and those are most fanatical who know least of the evidences on which their creed is based. Facts and testimony are not, e xcept in very rare instances, the ground-work of faith. It is an impera tive law of God's Economy, unyielding and inflexible as Himself, that man sh all accept without question the belief of those among whom he is born and reared; the faith so made a part of his nature resists all evidence to t he contrary; and he will disbelieve even the evidence of his own s enses, rather than yield up the religious belief which has grown up in him, flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone. What is truth to me is not trut h to another. The same arguments and evidences that convince one mind make no impression on another. This difference is in men at thei r birth. No man is entitled positively to assert that he is right, where other men, e qually intelligent and equally wellinformed, hold directly the opposite opinion. Each thinks it impossible for the other 'to be sincere, and each, as to that, is equally in error. \"What is truth?\" was a profound question, the most suggestive one ever put to man. Many beliefs of former and present times seem incomprehensible. They startle us with a new glimpse into t he human soul, that mysterious thing more mysterious the more we note its workings. Here is a man superior to myself in intellect and learning; and yet he sincerely believes what seems to me too absurd to merit conf utation; and I cannot conceive, and sincerely do not believe,that he is both sane and honest. And yet he is both. His reason is as pe rfect as mine, and he is as honest as I. The fancies of a lunatic are realities, to him. Our dreams are realities while they last; and, in the Past, no more unreal than what we have acted in our waking hours. No man can say that he hath as sure po ssession of the truth as of a chattel. When men ent ertain opinions diametrically opposed to each other, and each is honest, who shall decide which hath the Truth; and how can either say with certainty th at he hath it? We know not what is the truth. That we ourselves believe and feel absolutely certain that our own belief is true, is in reality not t he slightest proof of the fact, seem it never so certain and incapable of doubt to us. No man is responsible for the rightness of his faith; but only for the uprightness of it. Therefore no man hath or ever had a right to persecute another for his belief; for there cannot be two an tagonistic rights; and if one can persecute another, because he himself is satisfied that the belief of that other is erroneous, the other has, for the same reason, equally as certain a right to persecute him. The truth comes to us tinged and colored with our prejudices and our preconceptions, which are as old as ourselves, and strong with a divine force. It comes to us as the image of a rod comes to us through the water, bent and distorted. An argument sinks into and convinces the mind of one man, while from that of another it rebounds like a ball of ivory dropped on marble. It is no merit in a man to have a particular fait h, excellent and sound and philosophic as it may be, when he imbibed it with his mother's milk. It is no more a merit than his prejudices and his passions. The sincere Moslem has as much right to persecute us, as we to"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"persecute him; and therefore Mas onry wisely requires no more than a belief in One Great All-Powerful Deity, the Father and Preserver of the Universe. Therefore it is she teaches he r votaries that toleration is one of the chief duties of every good Mason, a component part of that charity without which we are mere hollow images of true Masons, mere sounding brass and tinkling cymbals. No evil hath so afflicted the world as intolerance of religious opinion. The human beings it has slain in various ways, if once and together brought to life, would make a nation of people; le ft to live and increase, would have doubled the popul ation of the civilized portion of the globe; among which civilized portion it chiefly is t hat religious wars are waged. The treasure and the human labor thus lost would have made the earth a garden, in which, but for his evil passions, man might now be as happy as in Eden. No man truly obeys the Masonic law who merely tolerates those whose religious opinions are opposed to his own. Every man's opinions are his own private property, and the rights of all men to maintain each his own are perfectly equal. Merely to tolerate , to bear with an opposing opinion, is to assume it to be heretical; and assert the right to persecute, if we would; and claim our toleration of it as a merit. The Mason's creed goes further than that. No man, it holds, has any right in any way to, interfere with the religious belief of another. It holds that each mat] is absolutely sovereign as to his own belief, and that belief is a matter absolutely foreign to all who do not entertain the same belief; and that, if there were any right of persecution at all, it would in all cases be a mutual right; because one party has the same right as the other to sit as judge in his own case; and God is the only magistrate that ca n rightfully decide between them. To 1hat great judge, Masonry refers the matter; and opening wide its portals, it invites to enter there and live in peace and harmony, t he Protestant, the Catholic, the Jew, the Moslem; every man who w ill lead a truly virtuous and moral life, love his brethren, sinister to the sick and distressed, and believe in the ONE, All Powerful, All-Wise, everywhere - Present GOD, Architect, Creator, and Preserver of all things, by whose universal law of Harmony ever rolls on this universe, the great, vast, infinite circle of successive Death and Life:- to whose INEFFABLE NAME let all true Masons pay profoundest homage! fo r whose thousand blessings poured upon us, let us feel the sincerest gr atitude, now, henceforth, and forever! We may well be tolerant of each other's creed; for in every faith there are excellent moral precepts. Far in the South of Asia, Zoroaster taught this doctrine: \"On commencing a journey, the Faithful should turn his thoughts toward Ormuzd, and confess him, in t he purity of his heart, to be King of the World; he should love him, do hi m homage, and serve him. He must be upright and charitable, despise t he pleasures of the body, and avoid pride and haughtiness, and vice in a ll its forms, and especially 'falsehood, one of the basest sins of which man can be guilty. He must forget injuries and not avenge himself. He must honor the memory of his parents and relatives. At night, before retiring to sleep, he should rigorously examine his conscience, and repent of the faults which weakness or ill-fortune had caused him to commit.\" He was required to pray for strength to persevere in the Good, and to obtain forgiveness for his errors. It was his duty to confess hi s faults to a Magus, or to a layman renowned for his virtues, or to the Sun. Fasting and maceration were prohibited; and, on the contrary, it was his duty suitably to nourish the body and to maintain its vigor, that his soul might be strong to resist the Genius of Darkness; that he might more attentively read the Divine Word, and have more courage to perform noble deeds. And in the North of Europe the Druids taught devotion to friends, indulgence for reciprocal wrongs, lo ve of deserved praise, prudence, humanity, hospitality, respect fo r old age, disregard of the future, temperance, contempt of death, and a chivalrous deference to woman."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Listen to these maxims from the Ha va Maal, or Sublime Book of Odin: \"If thou hast a friend, visit him often; the path will grow over with grass, and the trees soon cover it, if thou dost not constantly walk upon it. He is a faithful friend, who, having but two loaves, gives his friend one. Be never first to break with thy friend; sorrow wrings the heart of him who has no one save himself with whom to take counsel. There is no virtuous man who has not some vice, no bad man who has not some virtue. Happy he who obtains the pr aise and good-will of men; for all that depends on the will of another is hazardous and uncertain. Riches flit away in the twinkling of an eye; they are the most inconst ant of friends; flocks and herds perish, parents die, friends are not immortal , thou thyself diest; I know but one thing that doth not die, the judgment that is passed upon the dead. Be humane toward those whom thou meet est on the road. If the guest that cometh to thy house is a - cold, give him fire; the man who has journeyed over the mountains needs food and dr y garments. Mock not at the aged; for words full of sense come often from the wrinkles of age. Be moderately wise, and not over-prudent. Let no one seek to know his destiny, if he would sleep tranquilly. There is no malady more cruel than to be discontented with our lot. The glut ton eats his own death; and the wise man laughs at the fool's greediness. Nothing is more injurious to the young than excessive drinking; the more one drinks the more he loses his reason; the bird of forgetfulness si ngs before those who intoxicate themselves, and wiles away their souls. Man devoid of sense believes he will live always if he avoids war; but, if the lances spare him, old age will give him no quarter. Better live well than live long. When a man lights a fire in his house, death comes bef ore it goes out.\" And thus said the Indian books: \"Honor thy father and mother. Never forget the benefits thou hast receiv ed. Learn while thou art young. Be submissive to the laws of thy country. . Seek the company of virtuous men. Speak not of God but with respect. Live on good terms with thy fellow-citizens. Remain in thy proper place. Speak ill of no one. Mock at the bodily infirmities of none. Pursue not unrelentingly a conquered enemy. Strive to acquire a good reputa tion. Take counsel with wise men. The more one learns, the more he acquires the faculty of learning, Knowledge is the most permanent wealth. As well be dumb as ignorant. The true use of knowledge is to distinguish good from evil. Be not a subject of shame to thy parents. What one learns in youth endures like the engraving upon a rock. He is wise who knows himself. Let thy books be thy best friends. When thou attainest an hundred years, cease to learn. Wisdom is solidly planted, even on the shifting ocean. Deceive no one, not even thine enemy. Wisdom is a trea sure that everywhere commands its value. Speak mildly, even to the poor. It is sweeter to forgive than to take vengeance. Gaming and quarrels lead to misery. There is no true merit without the practice of virtue. To hono r our mother is the most fitting homage we can pay the Divinity. There is no tranquil sleep without a clear conscience. He badly understands hi s interest who breaks his word.\" Twenty-four centuries ago thes e were the Chinese Ethics: \"The Philosopher [Confucius] said, 'SAN ! my doctrine is simple, and easy to be understood.' THSENG-TSEU re plied, 'that is certain.' The Philosopher having gone out, the disciples asked what their master had meant to say. THSENG--TSEU responded, 'The doctrine of our Master consists solely in being upright of heart, and loving our neighbor as we love ourself.\"' About a century later, the Hebrew law said, \"If any man hate his neighbor ... then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to do unto his brother . . . Better is a neighbor that is near, than a. brother afar off ... Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\" In the same fifth century before Christ, SOCRATES the Grecian said, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\""},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Three generations earlier, ZOROASTER had said to the Persians: \"Offer up thy grateful prayers to the Lord, the most just and pure Ormuzd, the supreme and adorable God, who thus declared to his Prophet Zerdusht: 'Hold it not meet to do unto others wh at thou wouldst not desire done unto thyself; do that unto the people, which, when done to thyself, is not disagreeable unto thee.\"' The same doctrine had been long tau ght in the schools of Babylon, Alexandria, and Jerusalem. A Pagan declared to the Pharisee HILLEL that he was ready to embrace the Jewish re ligion, if he could make known to him in a few words a summary of the whole law of Moses. \"That which thou likest not done to th yself,\" said Hillel, \"do it not unto thy neighbor. Therein is all the law: the rest is nothing but the commentary upon it.\" \"Nothing is more natural,\" said CO NFUCIUS, \"nothing more simple, than the principles of that morality which I endeavor, by salutary maxims, to inculcate in you . . . It is humanity; wh ich is to say, that universal charity among all of our species, without distinct ion. It is uprightness ; that is, that rectitude of spirit and of heart, which make; one seek for truth in everything, and desire it, without dece iving one's self or others. It is, finally, sincerity or good faith; whic h is to say, that frankness, that openness of heart, tempered by self-re liance, which excl udes all feints and all disguising, as much in speech as in action.\" To diffuse useful information, to further intellectual refinement, sure forerunner of moral improvement, to hasten the coming of the great day, when the dawn of general knowledge shalt ,chase away the lazy, lingering mists of ignorance and error, even from the base of the great social pyramid, is indeed a high calling, in which the most splendid talents and consummate virtue may well press onward, eager to bear a part. From the Masonic ranks ought to go forth those whose genius and not their ancestry ennoble them, to open to a ll ranks the temple of science, and by their own example to make the humb lest men emulous to climb steps no longer inaccessible, and enter the unfolded gates burning in the sun. The highest intellectual cultivatio n is perfectly compatible with the daily cares and toils of worki ng-men. A keen relish for the most sublime truths of science belongs alike to every class of Mankind. And, as philosophy was taught in the sacred groves of Athens, and under the Portico, and in the old Temples of Eg ypt and India, so in our Lodges ought Knowledge to be dispensed, the Sc iences taught, and the Lectures become like the teachings of Socrates and Plato, of Agassiz and Cousin. Real knowledge never permitted eith er turbulence or unbelief; but its progress is the forerunner of libera lity and enlightened toleration. Whoso dreads these may well tremble; for he may be well assured that their day is at length come, and must put to spe edy flight the evil spirits of tyranny and persecution, which haunted the long night now gone down the sky. And it is to be hoped that the time will soon arrive, when, as men will no longer suffer themselves to be led bl indfolded in ignorance, so will they no more yield to the vile principle of j udging and treating their fellowcreatures, not according to the intrinsic merit of their actions, but according to the accidental and invol untary coincidence of their opinions. Whenever we come to treat with enti re respect those who conscientiously differ from ourselves, the only practica l effect of a difference will be, to make us enlighten the ignorance on one side or the other, from which it springs, by instructing them, if it be t heirs; ourselves, if it be our own; to the end that the only kind of un animity may be produced which is desirable among rational beings, - the agreement proceeding from full conviction after the freest discussion. The Elu of Fifteen ought therefore to ta ke the lead of his fellow-citizen, not in frivolous amusements, not in the degrading pursuits of the ambitious vulgar; but in the truly noble task of enlightening the mass of his countrymen, and of leaving his own name encircled, not with barbaric splendor, or attached to courtly gew gaws, but illustrat ed by the honors"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"most worthy of our rational natu re; coupled with the diffusion of knowledge, and gratefully pronounced by a few, at least, whom his wise beneficence has rescued from ignorance and vice.

To serve and do good to as many as possible, - there is nothing greater in your fortune than that you should be able, and nothing finer in your nature, than that you should be desirous to do this.\" This is the true mark for the aim of every man and Mason who either prizes the enjoyment of pure happiness, or sets a right value upon a high and unsullied renown. And if the benefactors of mankind, when they rest from their noble labors, shall be permitted to enjoy hereafter, as an appropriate reward of their virtue, th e privilege of looking down upon the blessings with which their exertions and charities, and perhaps their toils and sufferings have clothed the scene of their former exis tence, it will not, in a state of exalted purity and wis dom, be the founders of mighty dynasties, the conquerors of new em pires, the Cæsars, Alexanders, and Tamerlanes; nor the mere Kings and Counsellors, Presidents and Senators, who have lived for their party chiefly, and for their country only incidentally, often sacrificing to thei r own aggrandizement or that of their faction the good of their fellow-creatures ; - it will not be they who will be gratified by contemplating the monum ents of their inglorious fame; but those will enjoy that delight and march in that triumph, who can trace the remote effects of their enlightened benevolence in the improved condition of their species, and exult in the refl ection, that the change which they at last, perhaps after many years, surv ey, with eyes that age and sorrow can make dim no more, - of Knowledge become Power, - Virtue sharing that Empire, - Superstition dethroned, and Tyranny exiled, is, if even only in some small and very slight degree, yet still in some degree, the fruit, precious if costly, and though late repaid yet long enduring, of their own self-denial and strenuous exertion, of their own mite of charity and aid to education wisely bestowed, and of the hardships and hazards which they encountered here below. Masonry requires of its Initiates and vota ries nothing that is impracticable. It does not demand that they should und ertake to climb to those lofty and sublime peaks of a theoretical and imaginary unpractical virtue, high and cold and remote as the eternal snows that wrap the shoulders of Chimborazo, and at least as inaccessible as they. It asks that alone to be done which is easy to be done. It overtasks no one's strength, and asks no one to go beyond his means and capacities. It does not expect one whose business or profession yields him littl e more than the wants of himself and his family require, and whose time is necessarily occupied by his daily vocations, to abandon or neglect the business by which he and his children live, and devote himself and his means to the diffusion of knowledge among men. It does not expect him to publish books for the people, or to lecture, to the ruin of his private affairs, or to found academies and colleges, build up libraries, and entitle himself to statues. But it does require and expect every man of us to do something, within and according to his means; and ther e is no Mason who cannot do some thing, if not alone, then by combination and association. If a Lodge cannot aid in f ounding a school or an academy it can still do something. It can educate one boy or gi rl, at least, the child of some poor or departed brother. And it should never be forgotten, that in the poorest unregarded child that seems abandoned to ignorance and vice may slumber the virtues of a Socrates, t he intellect of a Bacon or a Bossuet, the genius of a Shakespeare, the ca pacity to benefit mankind of a Washington; and that in rescuing him from the mire in which he is plunged, and giving him the means of education and development, the Lodge that does it may be the direct and immediate means of conferring"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"upon the world as great a boon as that given it by John Faust the boy of Mentz; may perpetuate the liberties of a country and change the destinies of nations, and write a new chapter in the history of the world.

How often has an act of char ity, costing the doer littl e, given to the world a great painter, a great musician, a great inventor! How often has such an act developed the ragged boy into the benefactor of his race!

The poorest boy, helped by benevolence, may come to lead armies, to control senates, to decide an peace and war, to dictate to cabinets; and his magn ificent thoughts and noble words may be law many years hereafter to millions of men yet unborn. But the opportunity to effect a great good does not often occur to any one. It is worse than folly for one to lie idle and inert, and expect the accident to befall him, by which his influences shall live forever. He can expect that to happen, only in consequence of one or many or all of a long series of acts. He can expect to benefit the world onl y as men attain other results; by continuance, by persistence, by a ste ady and uniform habit of laboring for the enlightenment of the world, to t he extent of his me ans and capacity. For it is, in all instances, by steady labor, by giving enough of application to our work, and having enough of time for the doing of it, by regular pains-taking, and the plying of cons tant assiduities, and not by any process of legerdemain, that we secu re the strength and the staple of real excellence. It was thus that Demosthenes, clause after clause, and sentence after sentence, elaborated to the uttermost his im mortal orations. It was thus that Newton pioneered hi s way, by the steps of an ascending geometry, to the mechanism of the Heavens, and Le Verrier added a planet to our Solar System. It is a most erroneous opinion that those who have left the most stupendous monuments of intellect behind them, were not differently exercised from the rest of the species, but only differently gifted; that they signalized themselves only by thei r talent, and hardly ever by their industry; for it is in truth to the most stren uous application of those commonplace faculties which are diffused among all, that they are indebted for the glories which now enc ircle their remembrance and their name. We must not imagine it to be a vul garizing of genius, that it should be lighted up in any other way than by a direct inspiration from Heaven nor overlook the steadfastnes s of purpose, the devoti on to some single but great object, the unweariedness of labor that is given, not in convulsive and preternatural throes, but by little and little as the st rength of the mind may bear it; the accumulation of many small efforts, instead of a few grand and gigantic, but perhaps irregular mo vements, on the part of energies that are marvellous; by which former alone the great results are brought out that write their enduring records on the face of the earth and in the history of nations and of man. We must not overlook these elements, to which genius owes the best and proudest of her achievements; nor imagine that qualities so generally possessed as patience and pains-taking, and resolute industry, have no share in upholding a distinction so illu strious as that of the benefactor of his kind.

And so Masonry can do much, if each Mason be content to do his share, and if their united efforts are dire cted by wise counsels to a common purpose. \"It is for God and for Omni potency to do mighty things in a moment; but by degrees to grow to gr eatness is the course that He hath left for man.\" If Masonry will but be tr ue to her mission, and Maso ns to their promises and obligations - if, re-entering vigoro usly upon a career of beneficence, she and they will but pursue it earn estly and unfalteringly, remembering that our contributions to the cause of charity and education then deserve the greatest credit when it costs us something, the curtailing of a comfort or the relinquishment of a luxury, to ma ke them - if we will but give aid to what were once Masonry's great schemes for human improvement, not fitfully and spasmodically, but regularly and incessantly, as the vapors rise and the springs run, and as the sun rises and the stars come up into the heavens, then we may be sure that great results will be attained and a great work done. And then it will most surely be seen that Masonry is not effete or impotent, nor degenerated nor drooping to a fatal decay. XI. SUBLIME ELECT OF THE TWELVE OR PRINCE AMETH. [Elu of the Twelve.] The duties of a Prince Ameth are, to be earnest, true, reliable, and sincere; to protect the people against illegal impositions and exactions; to contend for their political rights, and to see, as far as he may or can, that those bear the burdens who reap the benefits of the Government. You are to be true unto all men. You are to be frank and sincere in all things. You are to be earnest in doing whatever it is your duty to do. And no man must repent that he has relied upon your resolve, your profession, or your word. The great distinguishing characteristic of a Mason is sympathy with his kind. He recognizes in the human race one great family, all connected with himself by those invisible lin ks, and that mighty net-work of circumstance, forged and woven by God. Feeling that sympathy, it is his first Masonic duty to serve his fellow-man. At his first entrance into the Orde r, he ceases to be isolated, and becomes one of a great brotherhood, assuming now duties toward every Mason that lives, as every Mason at the same moment assumes them toward him. Nor are those duties on his part confined to Masons alone. He assumes many in regard to his country, and especially toward the great, suffering masses of the common people; for t hey too are his brethren, and God hears them, inarticulate as the moanings of their misery are. By all proper"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"means, of persuasion and influence, and otherwise, if the occasion and emergency require, he is bound to defend them against oppression, and tyrannical and illegal exactions. He labors equally to defend and to improve the people. He does not flatter them to mislead them, nor fawn upon th em to rule them, nor conceal his opinions to humor them, nor tell them that they can never err, and that their voice is the voice of Go d. He knows that t he safety of every free government, and its continuan ce and perpetuity depend upon the virtue and intelligence of the common people; and tha t, unless their liberty is of such a kind as arms can neither procure nor take away; unless it is the fruit of manly courage, of justic e, temperance, and generous virtue - unless, being such, it has taken deep root in the minds and hearts of the people at large, there will not long be wantin g those who will snatch from them by treachery what they have acquired by arms or institutions. He knows that if, after being releas ed from the toils of war, the people neglect the arts of peace; if their peac e and liberty be a state of warfare; if war be their only virtue, and the summit of their praise, they will soon find peace the most adverse to their interests. It will be only a more distressing war; and that which they imagined liberty will be the worst of slavery. For, unless by the means of knowledge and morality, not frothy and loquacious, but genuine, unadulter ated, and sincere, they clear the horizon of the mind from those mists of error and passion which arise from ignorance and vice, they will always have those who will bend their necks to the yoke as if they were brutes; who, notwithstanding all their triumphs, will put them up to the highe st bidder, as if they were mere booty made in war; and find an exuberant source of wealth and power, in the people's ignorance, prejudice, and passions. The people that does not subjugate the propensit y of the wealthy to avarice, ambition, and sensuality, expel luxury from them and their families, keep down pauperism, diffuse knowledge among the poor, and labor to raise the abject from the mire of vice and low indulgence, and to keep the industrious from starving in sight of luxuriou s festivals, will find that it has cherished, in that avaric e, ambition, sensua lity, selfishness, and luxury of the one class, and th at degradation, misery, drunkenness, ignorance, and brutalizati on of the other, more stubborn and intractable despots at home than it ever encountere d in the field; and even its very bowels will be continually teeming with the intolerable pro geny of tyrants. These are the first enemies to be s ubdued; this constitutes the campaign of Peace; these are triumphs, difficul t indeed, but bloodless; and far more honorable than those trophies which are purchased only by slaughter and rapine; and if not victors in this service, it is in vain to have been victorious over the despotic enemy in the field. For if any people thinks that it is a grander; a more beneficial, or a wiser policy, to invent subtle expedients by stamps and imposts, for increasing the revenue and draining the life-blood of an impoverished people; to multiply its naval and military force; to rival in craft the ambassadors of foreign states; to plot the swallowing up of foreign territory; to make crafty treaties and alliances; to rule prostrate states and ab ject provinces by fear and force; than to administer unpollut ed justice to the people, to relieve the condition and raise the estate of the toiling masses, redress the injured and succor the distressed and conciliate the discontented, and speedily restore to every one his ow n; then that people is involved in a cloud of error, and will too late perceive, when the illusion of these mighty benefits has vanished, that in neglect ing these, which it thought inferior considerations, it has only been precipitating its own ruin and despair. Unfortunately, every age presents its own special problem, most difficult and often impossible to solve; and that which this age offers, and forces upon the consideration of all chinking men, is this - how, in a populous and wealthy country, blessed with fr ee institutions and a constitutional government, are the great masses of the manual-labor class to be"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"enabled to have steady work at fair wages, to be kept from starvation, and their children from vice and debauchery, and to be furnished with that degree, not of mere reading and writin g, but of knowledge, that shall fit them intelligently to do the duties a nd exercise the privileges of freemen; even to be intrusted with the dangerous right of suffrage? For though we do not know why God, being infinitely merciful as well as wise, has so ordered it, it seems to be unquestionably his law, that even in civilized and Christian countries, th e large mass of the population shall be fortunate, if, during their whole life, from infancy to old age, in health and sickness, they have enough of t he commonest and coarsest food to keep themselves and their children from the continual gnawing of hunger - enough of the commonest and coarsest clothing to protect them selves and their little ones from indecent exposure and the bitter cold; and if they have over their heads the rudest shelter. And He seems to have enacted this law - which no human community has yet found the means to abrogate - that when a country becomes populous, capital shall concentrate in the hands of a limited number of persons, and labor become more and more at its mercy, until mere manual labor, that of the weaver and ironworker, and other artisans, eventually ceases to be worth more t han a bare subsistence, and often, in great cities and vast extents of count ry not even that, and goes or crawls about in rags, begging, and st arving for want of work. While every ox and horse can find work, and is worth being fed, it is not always so with man. To be employed, to have a chance to work at anything like fair wages, becomes the great engrossing object of a man's life. The capitalist can live without em ploying the laborer, and discharges him whenever that labor ceases to be profitable. At the moment when the weather is most inclement, provisions dearest, and rents highest, he turns him off to starve. If the day-laborer is taken sick, his wages stop. When old, he has no pension to retire up on. His children cannot be sent to school; for before their bones are har dened they must get to work lest they starve. The ma n, strong and able-bodied, wo rks for a shilling or two a day, and the woman shivering over her little pan of coals, when the mercury drops far below zero, after her hungry children have wailed themselves to sleep, sews by the dim light of her lonely candle, for a bare pittance, selling her life to him who ba rgained only for the work of her needle. Fathers and mothers slay their children, to have the burial -fees, that with the price of one child's life they may continue life in those that survive. Little girls with bare feet sweep the street-crossings, when the winter wind pinches them, and beg piteously for pennies of those who wear warm furs. Children grow up in squalid misery and brutal ignorance; want compels virgin and wife to prostitute themselves; women starve and freeze, and lean up against the walls of workhouses, like bundles of foul rags, all night long, and night after ni ght, when the cold rain falls, and there chances to be no room for them within; and hundreds of families are crowded into a single building, rife with horrors and teeming with foul air and pestilence; where me n, women and children huddle together in their filth; all ages and all colors sl eeping indiscriminately together; while, in a great, free, Republican State, in th e full vigor of its youth and strength, one person in every seventeen is a pauper receiving charity. How to deal with this apparently inevitab le evil and mortal disease is by far the most important of all social problems. What is to be done with pauperism and over-supply of labor? How is the life of any country to last, when brutality and drunken semi-barbarism vote, and hold offices in their gift, and by fit representatives of themselv es control a government? How, if not wisdom and authority, but turbulence and low vice are to exalt to senatorships miscreants reeking with the odors and pollution of t he hell, the prize-ring, the brothel, and the stock-exchange, where gambling is legalized and rascality is laudable?"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Masonry will do all in its power, by dire ct exertion and cooperation, to improve and inform as well as to protect the peopl e; to better their physical condition, relieve their miseries, supply their wants, and minister to their necessities. Let every Mason in this good work do all that may be in his power. For it is true now, as it always was an d always will be, that to be free is the same thing as to be pious, to be wise, to be temperate and just, to be frugal and abstinent, and to be magnanimous and brave; and to be the opposite of all these is the same as to be a sl ave. And it usually happens, by the appointment, and, as it were, retributive justice of the Deity, that that people which cannot govern themselves, and moderate their passions, but crouch under the slavery of their lusts and vices, are delivered up to the sway of those whom they abhor, and made to submit to an involuntary servitude. And it is also sanctioned by the dictates of justice and by the constitution of Nature, that he who, from the imbecility or derangement of his intellect, is incapable of governing himself, shoul d, like a minor, be committed to the government of another. Above all things let us never forget that mankind constitutes one great brotherhood; all born to encounter su ffering and sorrow, and therefore bound to sympathize with each other. For no tower of Pride was ever yet high enough to lift its possessor above the trials and fears and frailit ies of humanity. No human hand ever built the wall, nor ever shall, that will keep out affliction, pain, and infirmity. Sickne ss and sorrow, trouble and death, are dispensations that level everything. They know none, high nor low. The chief wants of life, the great and grav e necessities of the human soul, give exemption to none. They make all poor , all weak. They put supplication in the mouth of every human being, as truly as in that of the meanest beggar. But the principle of misery is not an evil principle. We err, and the consequences teach us wisdom. All el ements, all the laws of things around us, minister to this end; and through the paths of painful error and mistake, it is the design of Providence to lead us to truth and happiness. If erring only taught us to err; if mistak es confirmed us in imprudence; if the miseries caused by vicious indulgenc e had a natural tendency to make us more abject slaves of vice, then suffe ring would be wholly evil. But, on the contrary, all tends and is designed to produce amendment and improvement. Suffering is the discipline of virtue; of that which is infinitely better than happiness, and yet embraces in itself all essential happiness. It nourishes, invigorates, and perfect s it. Virtue is the prize of the severely-contested race and hard-fou ght battle; and it is worth all the fatigue and wounds of the conflict. M an should go forth with a brave and strong heart, to battle with calamity. He is to master it, and not let it become his master. He is not to forsake the post of trial and of peril; but to stand firmly in his lot, until the great word of Providence shall bid him fly, or bid him sink. With resolution and courage the Mason is to do the work which it is appointed for him to do, looking through the dark cloud of human calamity, to the end that rise s high and bright before him. The lot of sorrow is great and sublime. None suffer forever, nor for nought, nor without purpose. It is the ordinance of God's wisdom, and of His Infinite Love, to procure for us infinite happiness and glory. Virtue is the truest liberty; nor is he free who stoops to passions; nor he in bondage who serves a noble master. Examples are the best and most lasting lectures; virtue t he best example. He that hath done good deeds and set good precedents, in sincerity, is happy. Time shall not outlive his worth. He lives truly after death, whose good deeds ar e his pillars of remembrance; and no day but adds so me grains to his heap of glory. Good works are seeds, that after so wing return us a continual harvest; and the memory of noble actions is more enduring than monuments of marble. Life is a school. The world is neit her prison nor penitentiary, nor a palace"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"of ease, nor an amphitheatre for games and spectacles; but a place of instruction, and discipline. Life is given for moral and spiritual training; and the entire course of the great school of life is an education for virtue, happiness, and a future existence. The periods of Life are its terms; all human conditions, its form s; all human employments, its lessons. Families are the primary departments of this moral education; the various circles of society, its advanced stages; Kingd oms and Republics, its universities. Riches and Poverty, Gayeties and Sorrows, Marriages and Funerals, the ties of life bound or broken, fit and fo rtunate, or untowar d and painful, are all lessons. Events are not blindl y and carelessly flung together. Providence does not school one man, and screen another from the fiery trial of its lessons. It has neither rich favorites nor poor victims. One event happeneth to all. One end and one design concern and urge all men. The prosperous man has been at school. Perhaps he has thought that it was a great thing, and he a great personage; but he has been merely a pupil. He thought, perhaps, that he was Master, and had nothing to do, but to direct and command; but there was ever a Master above him, the Master of Life. He looks not at our splendid state, or our many pretensions, nor at the aids and app liances of our learning; but at our learning itself. He puts the poor and the rich upon the same form; and knows no difference between them, but their progress. If from prosperity we have learned moderation, temperance, candor, modesty, gratitude to God, and generosit y to man, then we are entitled to be honored and rewarded. If we have le arned selfishness, selfindulgence, wrong-doing, and vice, to forget and overlook our less fortunate brother, and to scoff at t he providence of God, then we are unworthy and dishonored, though we have been nursed in affluence, or taken our degrees from the lineage of an hundred noble descents; as truly so, in the eye of Heaven, and of all right-thinking men, as though we lay, victims of beggary and disease, in the hospital, by the hedge, or on the dung-hill. The most ordinar y human equity looks not at the school, but at the scholar; and the equity of Heaven will not look b eneath that mark. The poor man also is at school . Let him take care that he learn, rather than complain. Let him hold to his integrity, his candor, and his kindness of heart. Let him beware of envy, and of bondage, and keep his self-respect. The body's toil is not hing. Let him beware of the mind's drudgery and degradation. While he betters his condition if he can, let him be more anxious to better his so ul. Let him be willing, while poor, and even if always poor, to learn pov erty's great lessons, fortitude, cheerfulness, contentment, and implicit confidence in God's Providence. With these, and patience, calmness , self-command, disinterestedness, and affectionate kindne ss, the humble dwelling may be hallowed, and made more dear and noble than the lo ftiest palace. Let him, above all things, see that he lose not his in dependence. Let him not cast himself, a creature poorer than the poor, an indolent, helpless, despised beggar, oft the kindness of others. Every man s hould choose to have God for his Master, rather than man; and escape not from this school, either by dishonesty or alms-taking, lest he fall into that state, worse than disgrace, where he can have no respect for himself. The ties of Society teach us to lo ve one another. That is a miserable society, where the absenc e of affectionate kindness is sought to be supplied by punctilious decorum, gr aceful urbanity, and polished insincerity; where ambition, jealousy , and distrust rule, in place of simplicity, confidenc e, and kindness. So, too, the social state teaches modesty and gentleness; and from neglect, and notice unworthily bestowed on others, and injustice, and the world's failure to appreciate us, we learn patience and quietness, to be superior to society's opinion, not cy nical and bitter, but gentle, candid, and affectionate still. Death is the great Teacher, stern, cold, inexorable, irresistible; whom the"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"collected might of the world cannot st ay or ward off. The breath, that parting from the lips of King or beggar, scarcely stirs the hushed air, cannot be bought, or brought back for a moment, with the wealth of Empires. What a lesson is this, teaching our frailty and feebleness, and an Infinite Power beyond us! It is a fearful lesson, t hat never becomes familiar. It walks through the earth in dread mystery, and lays it hands upon all. It is a universal lesson, that is read everywhere and by all men. Its message comes every year and every day. The past years are crowded with its sad and solemn mem entoes; and death's finger traces its handwriting upon the walls of every human habitation. It teaches us Duty; to act our part we ll; to fulfill the work assigned us. When one is dying, and after he is dead, there is but one question: Has he lived well? There is no evil in death but that which life makes. There are hard lessons in the school of God's Providence; and yet the school of life is carefully adjusted, in all its arrangements and tasks, to man's powers and passions. There is no extravagance in its teachings; nor is anything done for 'the sake of present effect. The whole course of human life is a conflict with difficul ties; and, if rightly conducted, a progress in improvement. It is never too late for man to learn. Not part only, but the whole, of life is a school. There never comes a time, even amidst the decays of age, when it is fit to lay aside the eagerness of acquisition, or the cheerfulness of endeavor. Man walks, all through the course of life, in patience and strife, and sometimes in darkness; for, from patience is to come perfection; from st rife, triumph is to issue; from the cloud of darkness the lightning is to flash that shall open the way to eternity. Let the Mason be faithful in the school of life, and to a ll its lessons! Let him not learn nothing, nor care not w hether he learns or not. Let not the years pass over him, witnes ses of only his sloth and indifference; or see him zealous to acquire everything but virtue. Nor let him labor only for himself; nor forget that the humbles t man that lives is his brother, and hath a claim on his sympathies and kind offices; and that beneath the rough garments which labor wears may beat hearts as noble as throb under the stars of princes. God, who counts by souls, not stations, Loves and pities you and me; For to Him all vain distinctions Are as pebbles on the sea. Nor are the other duties inculcated in this Degree of less importance. Truth, a Mason is early told, is a Divine attribute and the foundation of every virtue; and frankness, reliabilit y, sincerity, stra ightforwardness, plain-dealing, are but different modes in which Truth develops itself. The dead, the absent, the innocent, and th ose that trust him, no Mason will deceive willingly. To all these he owes a nobler justice, in that they are the most certain trials of human Equi ty. Only the most abandoned of men, said Cicero, will deceive him, who woul d have remained uninjured if he had not trusted. All the noble deeds t hat have beat their marches through succeeding ages have proceeded from men of truth and genuine courage. The man who is always true is both virtuous and wise; and thus possesses the greatest guards of sa fety: for the law has not power to strike the virtuous; nor can fortune subvert the wise. The bases of Masonry being morality and virtue, it is by studying one and practising the other, that the conduct of a Mason becomes irreproachable. The good of Humanity being its principa l object, disinterestedness is one of the first virtues that it requires of it s members; for that is the source of justice and beneficence. To pity the misfortunes of others; to be humble, but without meanness; to be proud, but without arrogance; to abjure every sentim ent of hatred and revenge; to show himself magnanimous and liberal, without ostentation and without profusion; to be the enemy of vice; to pay homage to wisdom and"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"virtue; to respect innocence; to be constant and patient in adversity, and modest in prosperity; to avoid every irregularity that stains the soul and distempers the body - it is by followi ng these precepts that a Mason will become a good citizen, a faithful husband , a tender father, an obedient son, and a true brother; will honor friend ship, and fulfill with ardor the duties which virtue and the social relations impose upon him. It is because Masonry imposes upon us t hese duties that it is properly and significantly styled work ; and he who imagines that he becomes a Mason by merely taking the first two or thre e Degrees, and that he may, having leisurely stepped upon that small elevat ion, thenceforward worthily wear the honors of Masonry, without labor or exertion, or self-denial or sacrifice, and that there is nothing to be done in Masonry, is strangely deceived. Is it true that nothing remains to be done in Masonry? Does one Brother no longer proceed by law against another Brother of his Lodge, in regard to matters that coul d be easily settled within the Masonic family circle? Has the duel, that hideo us heritage of barbar ism, interdicted among Brethren by our fundamental laws, an d denounced by the municipal code, yet disappeared from the soil we inhabit? Do Masons of high rank religiously refrain from it; or do they not, bowing to a corrupt public opinion, submit to its arbitrament, despite the scandal which it occasions to the Or der, and in violat ion of the feeble restraint of their oath? Do Masons no longer form uncharitable opinions of their Brethren, enter harsh judgments against them, and judge themselves by one rule and their Brethren by another? Has Masonry any well-regulated system of charity? Has it done that which it should have done for the cause of educ ation? Where are its schools, its academies, its colleges, its hospitals, and infirmaries? Are political controversies now conduct ed with no violence and bitterness? Do Masons refrain from defaming and denouncing their Brethren who differ with them in religious or political opinions? What grand social problems or useful projects engage our attention at our communications? Where in our Lodges are lectures habitually delivered for the real instruction of the Brethren? Do not our sessions pass in the discussion of minor matters of busine ss, the settlement of points of order and questions of mere administratio n, and the admission and advancement of Candidates, whom after their admi ssion we take no pains to instruct? In what Lodge are our ceremonies ex plained and elucidated; corrupted as they are by time, until their true feat ures can scarcely be distinguished; and where are those great prim itive truths of revelati on taught, which Masonry has preserved to the world? We have high dignities and sounding titles. Do their possessors qualify themselves to enlighten the world in respect to the aims and objects of Masonry? Descendants of those Initia tes who governed empires, does your influence enter into practical life and operat e efficiently in behalf of wellregulated and constitutional liberty? Your debates should be but friendly conversations. You need concord, union, and peace. Why then do you retain among you men who excite rivalries and jealousies; why permit great and violent controversy and ambitious pretensions'? Now do your own words and acts agree? If your Masonry is a nullity, how can you ex ercise any influence on others? Continually you praise each other, and utter elaborate and high wrought eulogies upon the Order. Ever ywhere you assume that you are what you should be, and nowhere do you look upon yourselves as you are. Is it true that all our actions ar e so many acts of homage to virtue? Explore the recesses of your hearts; let us examine ourselves with an impartial eye, and make answer to our own questioning! Can we bear to ourselves the consoling testimony that we always rigidly perform our duties; that we even half perform them?"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Let us away with this odious self-fla ttery! Let us be men, if we cannot be sages! The laws of Masonry, abov e others excellent, cannot wholly change men's natures. They enlighten them, they point out the true way; but they can lead them in it, only by repressing the fire of their passions, and subjugating their selfishness. Alas, these conquer , and Masonry is forgotten! After praising each other all our lives, there are always excellent Brethren, who, over our coffins, shower unlimited eulogies. Every one of us who dies, however useless his life, has bee n a model of all the virtues, a very child of the celestial light. In Egypt, among our old Masters, where Masonry was more cultivated than va nity, no one could gain admittance to the sacred asylum of the tomb until he had passed under the most solemn judgment. A grave tribunal sat in judgm ent upon all, even the kings. They said to the dead, \"Whoever thou art, give account to thy country of thy actions! What hast thou done with thy time and life? The law interrogates thee, thy country hears thee, Truth sits in judgment on thee!\" Princes came there to be judged, escorted only by their virtues and their vices. A public accuser recounted the history of the dead man's life, and threw the blaze of the torch of truth on all hi s actions. If it were adjudged that he had led an evil life, his memory wa s condemned in the presence of the nation, and his body was denied the honors of sepulture. What a lesson the old Masonry taught to the sons of the people! Is it true that Masonr y is effete; that the ac acia, withered, affords no shade; that Masonry no longer marc hes in the advance-guard of Truth? No. Is freedom yet univ ersal? Have ignorance and prejudice disappeared from the earth? Are there no longer enmities among men? Do cupidity and falsehood no longer exist? Do toleration and harmony prevail among religious and political sects? There are works yet left for Masonry to accomplish, greater than the twelve l abors of Hercules: to advance ever resolutely and steadily; to enlighten the minds of the people, to reconstruct society, to reform the la ws, and to improve the public morals. The eternity in front of it is as in finite as the one behind. And Masonry cannot cease to labor in the cause of social progress, without ceasing to be true to itself, Masonry. XII. GRAND MASTER ARCHITECT. [Master Architect.] THE great duties that are inculcated by the lessons taught by the workinginstruments of a Grand Master Architect, demanding so much of us, and taking for granted the capacity to perform them faithfully and fully, bring us at once to reflect upon the dignity of human nature, and the vast powers and capacities of the human soul; and to that theme we invite your attention in this Degree. Let us begin to rise from earth toward the Stars. Evermore the human soul struggles toward the light, toward God, and the Infinite. It is especially so in its aff lictions. Words go but a little way into the depths of sorrow. The thou ghts that writhe there in s ilence, that go into the stillness of Infinitude and Eternity, have no emblems. Thoughts enough come there, such as no tongue ever uttered. They do not so much want human sympathy, as higher help. There is a loneliness in deep sorrow which the Deity alone can relieve. Alo ne, the mind wrestles with the great problem of calamity, and seeks the solution from the Infinite Providence of"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Heaven, and thus is led directly to God. There are many things in us of which we are not distinctly conscious. To waken that slumbering consciousness into life, and so to lead the soul up to the Light, is one office of ever y great ministration to human nature, whether its vehicle be the pen, the pencil, or the tongue. We are unconscious of the intensity and awful ness of the life withi n us. Health and sickness, joy and sorrow, success and disappointment, life and death, love and loss, are familiar words upon our lips; and we do not know to what depths they point within us. We seem never to know what any thin g means or is worth until we have lost it. Many an organ, nerve, and fibre in our bodily frame performs its silent part for years, and we are quite unconscious of its value. It is not until it is injured that we discover that value, and find how essential it was to our happiness and comfort. We never know the full signi ficance of the words “property,\" \"ease,\" and \"health;\" the wealth of meaning in the fond epithets, \"parent,” “child,\" \"beloved,\" and \"friend,\" until the thing or the person is taken away; until, in place of the bright, visible being, comes the awful and desolate shadow, where noth ing is: where we stretch out our hands in vain, and strain our eyes u pon dark and dismal vacuity. Yet, in that vacuity, we do not lose the object that we loved. It becomes only the more real to us. Our blessings not only brighten when they depart, but are fixed in enduring reality; and love and friendship receive their everlasting seal under the cold impress of death. A dim consciousness of infinite mystery and grandeur lies beneath all the commonplace of life. There is an awfulness and a majesty around us, in all our little worldliness. The rude peas ant from the Apennines, asleep at the foot of a pillar in a majestic Roman church, seem s not to hear or see, but to, dream only of the herd he f eeds or the ground he tills in the mountains. But the choral symphonies fall softly upon his ear, and the gilded arches are dimly seen through his half-slumbering eyelids. So the soul, however given up to the occupations of daily life, cannot quite lose the sense of where it is, and of what is above it and around it. The scene of its actual engagements may be small; the path of its steps, beaten and familiar; the obj ects it handles, easily spanned, and qui te worn out with daily uses. So it may be, and amid st such things that we all live. So we live our little life; but Heaven is above us and all around and close to us; and Eternity is before us and behind us; and suns and stars are silent witnesses and watchers over us. We are enfolded by Infinity. Infinite Powers and Infinite spaces lie all around us. The dread arch of Mystery spreads over us, and no voice ever pierced it. Eternity is enthroned amid Heaven's myriad starry heights; and no ut terance or word ever came from those far-off and silent spaces. Above, is that awful majesty; around us, everywhere, it stretches off into infinity ; and beneath it is this little struggle of life, this poor day's conflict, this busy ant-hill of Time. But from that ant-hill, not only the talk of the str eets, the sounds of music and revelling, the stir and tread of a multitude, the shout of joy and the shriek of agony go up into the silent and all-surrounding Infinitude; but also, amidst the stir and noise of visibl e life, from the inmost bosom of the visible man, there goes up an imploring call, a beseeching cry, an asking, unuttered, and unutterable, for re velation, wailingly and in almost speechless agony praying the dread arch of mystery to break, and the stars that roll above the waves of mort al trouble, to speak; the enthroned majesty of those awful heights to find a voice; t he mysterious and reserved heavens to come near; and all to tell us what they alone know; to give us information of the loved and lo st; to make known to us what we are, and whither we are going. Man is encompassed with a dome of incomprehensible wonders. In him and about him is that which should fill his life with majesty and sacredness. Something of sublimity an d sanctity has thus flashed down from heaven into the heart of every one that lives. There is no being so"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"base and abandoned but hath some traits of that sacredness left upon him; something, so much perhaps in discordance with his general repute, that he hides it from all around him; some sanctuary in his soul, where no one may enter; some sacred inclosure, where the memory of a child is, or the image of a venerated parent, or the remembrance of a pure love, or the echo of some word of kindness once spoken to him; an echo that will never die away. Life is no negative, or superficial or worldly existence. Our steps are evermore haunted with thoughts, far be yond their own range, which some have regarded as the reminiscences of a preexistent state. So it is with us all, in the beaten and worn track of this worldly pilgrimage. There is more here, than the world we live in. It is not all of life to live. An unseen and infinite presence is here; a sense of something greater than we possess; a seeking, through all the void wastes of life, for a good beyond it; a crying out of the heart for interpretation; a memory of the dead, touching continually some vibrating thread in this great tiss ue of mystery. We all not only have better intimation s, but are capable of better things than we know. The pressure of some great emergency would develop in us powers, beyond the worl dly bias of our spirits; and Heaven so deals with us, from time to time, as to call forth those better things. There is hardly a family in the world go selfish, but that, if one in it were doomed to die - one, to be selected by the others, - it would be utterly impossible for its members, parents and children, to ch oose out that victim; but that each would say, \"I will die; but I cannot choo se.\" And in how many, if that dire extremity had come, would not one and another step forth, freed from the vile meshes of ordinary selfishness, and say, like the Roman father and son, \"Let the blow fall on me!\" There ar e greater and better things in us all, than the world takes account of, or than we take note of; if we would but find them out. And it is one part of our Masonic culture to find these traits of power and sublime devotion, to re vive these faded impressions of generosity and self-sacrifice, the almost squandered bequests of God's love and kindness to our souls; and to induce us to yield ourselves to their guidance and control. Upon all conditions of men presses down one impartial law. To all situations, to all fortunes, high or low, the mind gives their character. They are, in effect, not what they are in themselves, but what they are to the feeling of their possessors. The King may be mean, degraded, miserable; the slave of ambition, f ear, voluptuousness, and every low passion. The Peasant may be the real Monarch, the moral master of his fate, a free and lofty being, more than a Prince in happiness, more than a King in honor. Man is no bubble upon the sea of his fortunes, helpless and irresponsible upon the tide of events. Out of the same circumstances, different men bring totally different resu lts. The same difficulty, distress, poverty, or misfortune, that breaks down one man, builds up another and makes him strong. It is the very at tribute and glory of a man, that he can bend the circumstances of his condition to the in tellectual and moral purposes of his nature, and it is the powe r and mastery of his will t hat chiefly distinguish him from the brute. The faculty of moral will, developed in the child, is a new element of his nature. It is a new power brought u pon the scene, and a ruling power, delegated from Heaven. Never was a human being sunk so low that he had not, by God's gift, the power to rise, Because God commands him to rise, it is certain that he can rise. Every man has the power, and should use it, to make all situations, trials, and temptations instruments to promot e his virtue and happiness; and is so far from being the creature of circumstances, that he creates and controls them, making them to be all that they are, of evil or of good, to him as a moral being. Life is what we make it, and the world is what we make it. The eyes of the cheerful and of the melancholy man are fixed upon the same creation; but"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"very different are the aspects which it bears to them. To the one, it is all beauty and gladness; the waves of ocean roll in light, and the mountains are covered with day. Life, to him, fl ashes, rejoicing, upon every flower and every tree that trembles in the breeze. There is more to him, everywhere, than the eye sees; a pres ence of profound joy on hill and valley, and bright, dancing water. The other idly or mournfully gazes at the same scene, and everything wears a du ll, dim, and sickly aspect. The murmuring of the brooks is a discord to him, the great roar of the sea has an angry and threatening emphasis, th e solemn music of the pines sings the requiem of his departed happiness; the cheerful light shines garishly upon his eyes and offends him. The great train of the seasons passes before him like a funeral procession ; and he sighs, and turns impatiently away. The eye makes that which it looks upon; the ear makes its own melodies and discords; the world wit hout reflects the world within. Let the Mason never forget that life an d the world are what we make them by our social character; by our adaptat ion, or want of adaptation to the social conditions, relationships, and pur suits of the world. To the selfish, the cold, and the insensible, to the haughty and presuming, to the proud, who demand more than they are likely to receive, to the jealous, ever afraid they shall not receive enough, to those who are unreasonably sensitive about the go od or ill opinions of others, to all violators of the social laws, the rude, the violent, the dishonest, and the sensual, - to all these, the social condition, from it s very nature, will pr esent annoyances, disappointments, and pains, appropriate to their several characters. The benevolent affections will not revolv e around selfishness; the cold-hearted must expect to meet coldness; the pr oud, haughtiness; the passionate, anger; and the violent, rudeness. Those who forget the rights of others, must not be surprised if their own are forgotten; and those who stoop to the lowest embraces of sense must not wonder, if others are not concerned to find their prostrate hono r, and lift it up to the remembrance and respect of the world. To the gentle, many will be gentle; to the kind, many will be kind. A good man will find that there is goodness in the world; an honest man will find that there is honesty in the world; and a man of pr inciple will find principle and integrity in the minds of others. There are no blessings which the mind may not convert into the bitterest of evils; and no trials which it may not transform into the noblest and divinest blessings. There are no temptations from which assailed virtue may not gain strength, instead of fa lling before them, vanquished and subdued. It is true that temptations have a great power, and virtue often falls; but the might of thes e temptations lies not in themselves, but in the feebleness of our own virtue, and th e weakness of our own hearts. We rely too much on the strength of our ramparts and bastions, and allow the enemy to make his approaches, by trench and parallel, at his leisure. The offer of dishonest gain and guilty pleasure makes the honest man more honest, and the pure man more pure. They raise his virtue to the height of towering indignation. The fair occasion, the safe opportunity, the tempting chance become the defeat and disgrace of the tempter. The honest and upright man does not wait until temptation has made its approaches and mounted its batteries on the last parallel. But to the impure, the dishonest, the fa lse-hearted, the corrupt, and the sensual, occasions come every day, and in every scene, and through every avenue of thought and imaginati on. He is prepared to capitulate before the first approach is commenced; and sends out the white flag when the enemy's advance comes in sight of his walls. He makes occasions; or, if opportunities come not, evil thoughts come, and he throws wide open the gates of his hea rt and welcomes those bad visitors, and entertains them with a lavish hospitality. The business of the world absorbs, corrupts, and degrades one mind, while in another it feeds and nurses the noblest independence, integrity,"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"and generosity. Pleasure is a poison to some, and a healthful refreshment to others. To one, the world is a gr eat harmony, like a noble strain of music with infinite modulations; to anot her, it is a huge factory, the clash and clang of whose machinery jars upon his ears and frets him to madness. Life is substantially the same thing to all who partake of it s lot. Yet some rise to virtue and glory; while others, undergoing the same discipline, and enjoying the same privileges, sink to shame and perdition. Thorough, faithful, and honest endeavor to improve, is always successful, and the highest happiness. To sigh se ntimentally over human misfortune, is fit only for the mind's childhood; and t he mind's misery is chiefly its own fault; appointed, under the good Providen ce of God, as the punisher and corrector of its fault. In the long run, the mind will be happy, just in proportion to its fidelity and wisdom. W hen it is miserable, it has planted the thorns in its own path; it grasps them, and cries out in loud complaint;. and that complaint is but the louder co nfession that the thorns which grew there, it planted. A certain kind and degree of spirituality enter into the largest part of even the most ordinary life. You can carry on no business, without some faith in man. You cannot even dig in the groun d, without a relianc e on the unseen result. You cannot think or reason or even step, without c onfiding in the inward, spiritual principles of your na ture. All the affections and bonds, and hopes and interests of life centre in th e spiritual; and you know that if that central bond were broken, the world would rush to chaos. Believe that there is a God; that He is our father; that He has a paternal interest in our welfare and improvement; that He has giv en us powers, by means of which we may escape from si n and ruin; that He has destined us to a future life of endless progress toward perfection and a knowledge of Himself - believe this, as every Mason should, and you can live calmly, endure patiently, labor resolutely, deny yourselves cheerfully, hope steadfastly, and be conquerors in the grea t struggle of life. Take away any one of these principles, and what re mains for us? Say that there is no God; or no way opened for hope and reformation and triumph, no heaven to come, no rest for the weary, no home in the bosom of God for the afflicted and disconsolate soul; or that God is but an ugly blind Chance that stabs in the dark; or a somew hat that is, when attempted to be defined, a nowhat, emotio nless, passionless, the Supreme Apathy to which all things, good and evil, are alik e indifferent; or a jealous God who revengefully visits the sins of the fathers on the children, and when the fathers have eaten sour grapes, sets the child ren's teeth on e dge; an arbitrary supreme Will, that has made it right to be virtuous , and wrong to lie and steal, because IT pleased to make it so rather than otherwise, retaining the power to reverse the law; or a fi ckle, vacillating, inconstant Deity, or a cruel, bloodthirsty, savage Hebrew or Puritanic one; and we are but the sport of chance and the victims of despair; hap less wanderers upon the face of a desolate, forsaken, or accursed and hated earth; surroun ded by darkness, struggling with obstacles, toiling for barren results and empty purposes, distracted with doubts, and misled by false gleams of light; wanderers with no way, no prospect, no home; doomed and deserted mariners on a dark and stormy sea, without compass or course, to whom no stars appear; tossing helmless upon the weltering, angry waves, with no blessed haven in the distance whose guiding-star invites us to its welcome rest. The religious faith thus taught by Masonry is indispensable to the attainment of the great ends of life; and must therefore have been designed to be a part of it. We are made for this faith; and there must be something, somewhere, for us to belie ve in. We cannot grow healthfully, nor live happily, without it. It is therefor e true. If we could cut off from any soul all the principles taught by Masonry, the faith in a God, in immortality, in virtue, in essential re ctitude, that soul would si nk into sin, misery,"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"darkness, and ruin. If we could cut off all sense of these truths, the man would sink at once to the grade of the animal. No man can suffer and be patient, c an struggle and conquer, can improve and be happy, otherwise than as th e swine are, without conscience, without hope, without a reliance on a just , wise, and beneficent God. We must, of necessity, embrace the great truths taught by Masonry, and live by them, to live happily. \"I put my trus t in God,\" is the protest of Masonry against the belief in a cruel, angry, and revengeful God, to be feared and not reverenced by His creatures. Society, in its great relati ons, is as much the creation of Heaven as is the system of the Universe. If that bond of gravitation that holds all worlds and systems together, were s uddenly severed, the univers e would fly into wild and boundless chaos. And if we were to sever all the moral bonds that hold society together; if we could cut o ff from it every conviction of Truth and Integrity, of an authority above it, and of a conscience within it, it would immediately rush to disorder and frightful anarchy and ruin. The religion we teach is therefore as re ally a principle of things, and as certain and true, as gravitation. Faith in moral principles, in virtue, and in God, is as necessary for the guidance of a man, as instinct is for the guidance of an animal. And therefore this faith, as a principle of man's nature, has a mission as truly authentic in God's Providence, as the principle of instinct. The pleasures of the soul, too, must depend on certai n principles. They must recognize a soul, its properties and re sponsibilities, a conscience , and the sense of an authority above us; and these are the pr inciples of faith. No man can suffer and be patient, can struggle and conquer, can improve and be happy, without conscienc e, without hope, withou t a reliance on a just, wise, and beneficent God. We must of necessity embrace the great truths taught by Masonry, and live by them, to live happily. Everything in the universe has fixed and certain laws and prin ciples for its action;- the star in its orbit, the animal in its activity, the physical man in his functions. And he has likewise fixed and certain laws and principles as a spiritual being. His soul does not die for want of alimen t or guidance. For the rational soul there is ample provision. From the lofty pine, rocked in the darkening tempest, the cry of the young raven is heard; and it would be most strange if there were no answer for the cry and call of the soul, tortured by want and sorrow and agony. The total rejection of all moral and religious belief would strike out a principle from hum an nature, as essential to it as gravitation to the stars, instinct to anim al life, the circulation of the blood to the human body. God has ordained that life shall be a so cial state. We are members of a civil community. The life of that community depends upon its moral condition. Public spirit, intelligence, uprightness, temperance, kindness, domestic purity, w ill make it a happy community, and give it prosperity and continuance. Wide-spread selfishne ss, dishonesty, intemperance, libertinism, corruption, and crime, will ma ke it miserable, and bring about dissolution and speedy ruin. A whole people lives one life; one mighty heart heaves in its bosom; it is one great pulse of existence that throbs there. One stream of life flows t here, with ten thousand intermingled branches and channels, through all the homes of human love. One sound as of many waters, a rapturous jubilee or a mournful sighing, comes up from the congregated dwellings of a whole nation. The Public is no vague abstraction; nor should that which is done against that Public, against public interest, law, or virtue, press but lightly on the conscience. It is but a vast expansion of individual life; an ocean of tears, an atmosphere of sighs, or a great whole of joy and gladness. It suffers with the suffering of millions; it rejoices with the joy of millions. What a vast crime does he commit, - private man or public man, agent or contractor, legislator or magistrate, secretary or president,-who dares, with indignity and wrong, to strike the bosom of the Public Welfare, to encourage"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"venality and corruption, and shameful sale of the elective fr anchise, or of office; to sow dissension, and to weak en the bonds of amity that bind a Nation together! What a huge iniquity, he who, with vices like the daggers of a parricide, dares to pierce that mighty heart, in which the ocean of existence is flowing! What an unequalled interest lies in the virtue of every one whom we love! In his virtue, nowhere but in his virtue, is garnered up the incomparable treasure. What care we for brother or friend, compared with what we care for his honor, his fidelity, his reputa tion, his kindness? How venerable is the rectitude of a parent! How sacred hi s reputation! No blight that can fall upon a child, is like a parent's dish onor. Heathen or Christian, every parent would have his child do well; and pours out upon him all the fullness of parental love, in the one des ire that he may do well; that he may be worthy of his cares, and his freely bestowed pains; that he may walk in the way of honor and happiness. In that way he cannot walk one step without virtue. Such is life, in its relationships. A thousand ties embrace it, like the fine nerves of a delicate organization; like the strings of an instrument capable of sweet me lodies, but easily put out of tune or broken, by rudeness, anger, and selfish indulgence. If life could, by any process, be made insensible to pain and pleasure; if the human heart were hard as adamant, then avarice, ambition, and sensuality might channel out their paths in it, and make it their beaten way; and none would wonder or protest. If we could be patient under the load of a mere worldly life; if we coul d bear that burden as the beasts bear it; then, like beasts, we might bend a ll our thoughts to the earth; and no call from the great Heavens above us would startle us from our plodding and earthly course. But we art not insensible brutes, who can refuse the call of reason and conscience. The soul is capabl e of remorse. When the great dispensations of life pr ess down upon us, we weep, and suffer and sorrow. And sorrow and agony desire other companionships than worldliness and irreligion. We are not willing to bear thos e burdens of the heart, fear, anxiety, disappointment , and trouble, without any object or use. We are not willing to suffer, to be sick and afflicted, to have our days and months lost to comfort and joy, and overshadowed with calamity and grief, without advantage or compensatio n; to barter away the dearest treasures, the very sufferi ngs, of the heart; to sell the life-blood from failing frame and fading cheek, our tears of bi tterness and groans of anguish, for nothing. Human nature, frail, feeling, sensitive, and sorrowing, cannot bear to suffer for nought. Everywhere, human life is a great and solemn dispensation. Man, suffering, enjoying, loving, hating, hop ing, and fearing, chained to the earth and yet exploring the far recesses of the universe, has the power to commune with God and His angels. Around this great action of existence the curtains of Time are drawn; but there are openings through them which give us glimpses of eternity . God looks down upon this scene of human probation. The wise and the good in all ages have interposed for it with their teachings and th eir blood. Everything th at exists around us, every movement in nature every counsel of Prov idence, every interposition of God, centres upon one poi nt - the fidelity of man. And even if the ghosts of the departed and reme mbered could come at midnight through the barred doors of our dwelli ngs, and the shrou ded dead s hould glide through the aisles of our churches and sit in our Masonic Temples, their teachings would be no more el oquent and impressive than the Great realities of life; than t hose memories of misspent years, those ghosts of departed opportunities, that, pointing to our conscience and eternity cry continually in our ears, \"Work while the day lasts! for the night of death cometh, in which no man can work.” There are no tokens of public mourning for the calamity of the soul. Men weep when the body dies; and when it is borne to its last rest, they follow"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"it with sad and mournful procession. But for the dying soul there is no open lament ation; for the lost soul there are no obsequies. And yet the mind and soul of man hav e a value which nothing else has. They are worth a care which nothing el se is worth; and to the single, solitary individual, they ought to poss ess an interest which nothing else possesses. The stored treasures of the heart, the unfathomable mines that are in the soul to be wrought , the broad and boundless realms of Thought, the freighted argosy of man's hopes and best affections, are brighter than gold and dearer than treasure. And yet the mind is in reality little know n or considered. It is all which man permanently is, his inward being, his di vine energy, his immortal thought, his boundless capacity, his infinite aspi ration; and nevertheless, few value it for what it is worth. Few see a br other-mind in others, through the rags with which poverty has clothed it, b eneath the crushing burdens of life, amidst the close pressure of worldly troubles, wants and sorrows. Few acknowledge and cheer it in that humble blot, and feel that the nobility of earth, and the commencing glory of Heaven are there. Men do not feel the worth of their own souls. They are proud of their mental powers; but the intrinsic, inner, infinite worth of their own minds they do not perceive. The poor man, admitted to a palace, feels, lofty and immortal being as he is, like a mere or dinary thing amid the splendors that surround him. He sees the carriage of wealth roll by him, and forgets the intrinsic and eternal dignity of his own mind in a poor and degrading envy, and feels as an humbler creature, bec ause others are above him, not in mind, but in mensuration. Men respect themselves, according as they are more wealthy, higher in rank or office, loftier in the world's opinion, able to command more votes, more the favorites of the people or of Power. The difference among men is not so much in their nature and intrinsic power, as in the faculty of communication. Some have the capacity of uttering and embodying in words their thou ghts. All men, more or less, feel those thoughts. The glory of genius and the rapture of virtue, when rightly revealed, are diffused and shared among unnumbered minds. When eloquence and poetry speak; when those glorious arts, statuary, painting, and music, take audible or visible sh ape; when patriotism, charity, and virtue speak with a thrilling potenc y, the hearts of thousands glow with a kindred joy and ecstasy. If it were not so , there would be no eloquence; for eloquence is that to which other hearts respond; it is the faculty and power of making other hearts respond. No one is so low or degraded, as not sometimes to be touched with the bea uty of goodness. No heart is made of materials so common, or even ba se, as not sometimes to respond, through every chord of it, to the call of honor, patriotism, generosity, and virtue. The poor African Slave will die fo r the master. or mistress, or in defence of the children, whom he loves. The poor, lost, scorned, abandoned, outcast woman will, withou t expectation of reward nurse those who are dying on every hand, utter strangers to her, with a contagious and horrid pestilence. T he pickpocket will scale burning walls to rescue child or woman, unknown to him, from the ravenous flames. Most glorious is this capacity! A power to commune with God and His Angels; a reflection of the Uncreated Light; a mirror that can collect and concentrate upon itself all the moral sp lendors of the Universe. It is the soul alone that gives any value to the things of this world. and it is only by raising the soul to its just elevation above all other th ings, that we can look rightly upon the purposes of this earth. No sceptre nor throne, nor structure of ages, nor broad empire , can compare with the wonders and grandeurs of a single thought. That al one, of all things that have been made, comprehends the Maker of all. That alone is the key which unlocks all the treasures of the Universe; the po wer that reigns over Space, Time, and Eternity. That, under God, is the Sovereign Dispenser to man of all"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"the blessings and glories that lie within the compass of possession, or the range of possibility. Virt ue, Heaven, and Immortality exist no t, nor ever will exist for us except as they exist and will exist, in the perception, feeling, and thought of the glorious mind. My Brother, in the hope that you have listened to and understood the Instruction and Lecture of this Degree, and that you feel the dignity of your own nature and the vast capacities of your own soul for good or evil, I proceed briefly to communicate to you the remaining instruction of this Degree. The Hebrew word, in the old Hebrew and Samaritan character, suspended in the East, over the five columns, is ADONAÏ, one of the names of God, usually translated Lord; and which the Hebrews, in reading, always substitute fo r the True Name, which is for them ineffable. The five columns, in the five different orde rs of architecture, are emblematical to us of the five principal divisions of t he Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite: 1. - The Tuscan, of the three blue De grees, or the primitive Masonry. 2. - The Doric, of the ineffable Degrees, from the, fourth to the fourteenth, inclusive. 3. - The Ionic, of the fi fteenth and sixtee nth, or second temple Degrees. 4. - The Corinthian, of the seventeenth and eighteenth Degrees, or those of the new law. 5. - The Composite, of the philosophical and chivalric Degrees in termingled, from the nineteenth to the thir ty-second, inclusive. The North Star, always fixed and immutabl e for us, represents the point in the centre of the circle, or the Deity in the c entre of the Universe. It is the especial symbol of duty and of faith. To it, and the seven that continually revolve around it, mystical meanings are attach ed, which you will learn hereafter, if you should be permitted to advance, when you are made acquainted with the philosophical doctrines of the Hebrews. The Morning Star, rising in the East, Jupi ter, called by the Hebrews Tsadõc or Tsydyk, Just, is an emblem to us of the ever approaching dawn of perfection and Masonic light. The three great lights of the Lodge are symbol s to us of the Power, Wisdom, and Beneficence of the Deity. They are also symbols of the first three Sephiroth, or Emanations of the Deity, according to th e Kabalah, Kether, the omnipotent divine will; Chochmah, the divine intellectual po wer to generate thought, and Binah, the divine intellectual capacity to produce it - the two latter, usually translated Wisdom and Understanding, being the acti ve and the passive, the positive and the negative, which we do not yet endeavor to explain to you. They are the columns Jachin and Boaz, that stand at the entrance to t he Masonic Temple. In another aspect of this Degree, the Ch ief of the Architects [ , Rab Banaim,] symbolizes the constitutional executive head and chief of a free government; and the Degree teaches us that no free go vernment can long endure, when the people cease to select for their magistrates the be st and the wisest of their statesmen; when, passing these by, they permit factions or sordid interests to select for them the small, the low, the ignoble, and the obscure, and into such hands commit the country's destinies. There is, after all, a \"divine right\" to govern; and it is vested in the abl est, wisest, best, of every nation. \"Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding: I am power: by me kings do reign, and princes decree justice; by me princes rule, and nobles, even all the magistrates of the earth.\" For the present, my Brother, let this suffice. We welcome you among us, to this peaceful retreat of virtue, to a participation in our privileges, to a share in our joys and our sorrows. "},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" XIII. ROYAL ARCH OF SOLOMON. WHETHER the legend and history of this Degree are historically true, or but an allegory, containing in itself a deeper truth and a profounder meaning, we shall not now debate. If it be but a legendary myth, you must find out for yourself what it means. It is certain that the word which the Hebrews are not now permitted to pronounce was in common use by Abraham, Lot, Isaac, Jacob, Laban, Rebecca, and even among tribes foreign to the Hebrews, before the time of Moses; and that it recurs a hundred times in the lyrical effusions of David and other Hebrew poets. We know that for many centuries the Hebrews have been forbidden to pronounce the Sacred Name; that wherever it occurs, they have for ages read the word Adonaï instead; and that under it, when the masoretic points, which represent the vowels, came to be used, they placed those which belonged to the latter word. The possession of the true pronunciation was deemed to confer on him who had it extraordinary and supernatural powers; and the Word itself, worn upon the person, was regarded as an amulet, a protection against personal danger, sickness, and evil spirits. We know th at all this was a vain su perstition, natural to a rude people, necessarily disappearing as the intellect of man became enlightened; and wholly unworthy of a Mason. It is noticeable that this notion of th e sanctity of the Divine Name or Creative Word was common to all the ancient nations. The Sacred Word HOM was supposed by the ancient Pe rsians (who were among the earliest emigrants from Northern India) to be pregnant with a mysterious power; and they taught that by its utterance the world was created. In India it was forbidden to pronounce the word AUM or OM, the Sacred Name of the One Deity, manifested as Brahma, Vishna, and Seeva. These superstitious notions in regard to the e fficacy of the Word, and the prohibition against pronouncing it, c ould, being errors, have formed no part of the pure primitive religion, or of the esoteric doc trine taught by Moses, and the full knowledge of whic h was confined to the Initiates; unless the whole was but an ingenious invention for the concealment of some other Name or truth, the interpretation and meaning whereof was made known only to the select few. If so, the common notions in regard to the Word grew up in the minds of the people, like other errors and fables among all the ancient nations, out of original truths and symbols and allegories misunderstood. So it has al ways been that allegories, intended as vehicles of truth, to be understoo d by the sages, have become or bred errors, by being literally accepted. It is true, that before the masoretic poi nts were invented (which was after the beginning of the Christian era), the pronunciation of a word in the Hebrew language could not be known from the characters in which it was written. It was, therefore, possible fo r that of the name of the Deity to have been forgotten and lost. It is certain th at its true pronunciation is not that represented by the word Jehovah; and t herefore that that is not the true name of Deity, nor the Ineffable Word. The ancient symbols and allegories always had more than one interpretation. They always had a double meaning, and sometimes more than two, one serving as the envelope of the other. Thus the pronunciation of the word was a symbol; and that pronunciation and the word itself were lost, when the knowledge of the true na ture and attributes of God faded out of the minds of the Jewish people. T hat is one interpretation - true, but"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"not the inner and profoundest one. Men were figuratively said to forget t he name of God, when they lost that knowledge, and worshipped the heathen deities, and burned incense to them on the high places, and passed their children through the fire to Moloch. Thus the attempts of the ancient Israelit es and of the Initiates to ascertain the True Name of the Deity, and its pronunciation, and the loss of the True Word, are an allegory, in which are represented the general ignorance of the true nature and attributes of God, the proneness of the people of Judah and Israel to worship other deities, and the low and erroneous and dishonoring notions of the Grand Architect of the Universe, which all shared except a few favored persons; for even Solomon built altars and sacrif iced to Astarat, the goddess of the Tsidumm, and Malcüm, the Aamünite god, and built high places for Kamüs, the Moabite deity, and Malec the god of the Beni-Aamün. The true nature of God was unknown to them, like His name; and they worshipped the calves of Jeroboam, as in the deser t they did that made for them by Aarün. The mass of the Hebrews did not believe in the existence of one only God until a late period in their history. Their. early and popular ideas of the Deity were singularly low and unwort hy. Even while Moses was receiving the law upon Mount Sinai, they forced Aarün to make them an image of the Egyptian god Apis, and fell down and adored it. They were ever ready to return to the worship of the gods of the Mitzraim; and soon after the death of Joshua they became devout wo rshippers of the false gods of all the surrounding nations. \"Ye have borne,\" Amos, the prophet, said to them, speaking of their forty years' jo urneying in the desert, under Moses, \"the tabernacle of your Malec and Kaiün your idols, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.\" Among them, as among other nations, the conceptions of God formed by individuals varied according to their in tellectual and spirit ual capacities; poor and imperfect, and investing G od with the commonest and coarest attributes of humanity, among the ig norant and coarse; pure and lofty among the virtuous and richly gift ed. These conceptions gradually improved and became purified and ennobled, as the nation advanced in civilization - being lowest in the historical books, amended in the prophetic writings, and reaching their high est elevation among the poets. Among all the ancient nations there wa s one faith and one idea of Deity for the enlightened, intelli gent, and educat ed, and another for the common people. To this rule the Hebrews we re no exception. Yehovah, to the mass of the people, was like the gods of the nations around them, except that he was the peculiar God, first of the family of Abraham, of that of Isaac, and of that of Jacob, and afterwar d the National God; and, as they believed, more powerful than the other gods of the same nature worshipped by their neighbors - \"Who among the Baalim is like unto thee, O Yehovah?\" - expressed th eir whole creed. The Deity of the early Hebrews talked to Adam and Eve in the garden of delight, as he walked in it in the co ol of the day; he conversed with Kayin; he sat and ate with Abraham in his te nt; that patriarch required a visible token, before he would believe in his positive promise; he permitted Abraham to expostulate with him, and to induce him to change his first determination in regard to Sodom; he wrestled with Jacob; he showed Moses his person, though not his face ; he dictated the minutest police regulations and the dimensions of the t abernacle and its furniture, to the Israelites; he insisted on and delighted in sacrifices and burnt-offerings; he was angry, jealous, and revengeful, as well as wavering and irresolute; he allowed Moses to reason him out of his fixed resolution utterly to destroy his people; he commanded the performa nce of the most shocking and hideous acts of cruelty and barbarity. He hardened the heart of Pharaoh;"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"he repented of the evil that he had said he would do unto the people of Nineveh; and he did it not, to the disgust and anger of Jonah. Such were the popular notions of the Deity; and either the priests had none better, or took little trouble to correct these notions; or the popular intellect was not enough enlarged to enable them to entertain any higher conceptions of the Almighty. But such were not the ideas of the intellectual and enlightened few among the Hebrews. It is certain that they possessed a knowledge of the true nature and attributes of God; as the same class of men did among the other nations - Zoroaster, Menu, Confuc ius, Socrates, and Plato. But their doctrines on this subject were esoteric ; they did not communicate them to the people at large, but only to a favored few; and as they were communicated in Egypt and India, in Persia and Phoenicia, in Greece and Samothrace, in the greater myst eries, to the Initiates. The communication of this knowledge and other secrets, some of which are perhaps lost, constituted, under other names, what we now call Masonry, or Free or Frank-Masonry. T hat knowledge was, in one sense, the Lost Word, which was made known to the Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Masons. It would be folly to pretend that the fo rms of Masonry were the same in those ages as they are now. The present name of the Order, and its titles, and the names of the Degrees now in use, were not then known. Even Blue Masonry cannot trace back it s authentic history, with its present Degrees, further than the year 1700, if so far. But, by whatever name it was known in this or the other country , Masonry existed as it now exists, the same in spirit and at heart, not only when Solomon builded the temple, but centuries before - before even the first colonies emigrated into Southern India, Persia, and Egypt, from the cradle of the human race. The Supreme, Self-existent, Eternal, All- wise, All-powerful, Infinitely Good, Pitying, Beneficent, and Merciful Cr eator and Preserver of the Universe was the same, by whatever name he was called, to the intellectual and enlightened men of all nations. The name was nothing, if not a symbol and representative hieroglyph of his natu re and attributes. The name AL represented his remotene ss above men, his inaccessibility; BAL and BALA, his might; ALOHIM, his various potencies; IHUH, existence and the generation of things. None of his nam es, among the Orientals, were the symbols of a divinely infinite love and tenderness, and all-embracing mercy. As MOLOCH or MALEK he was but an omnipotent monarch, a tremendous and ir responsible Will; as ADONAÏ, only an arbitrary LORD and Master; as AL Shadaï, po tent and a DESTROYER. To communicate true and correct ideas in respect of the Deity was one chief object of the mysteries. In them, Khürüm the King, and Khürüm the Master, obtained their knowledge of him and his attributes; and in them that knowledge was taught to Moses and Pythagoras. Wherefore nothing forbids you to co nsider the whole legend of this Degree, like that of the Master's , an allegory, representing the perpetuation of the knowledge of t he True God in the sanctuaries of initiation. By the subterranean vaults you may understand the places of initiation, which in the ancient ceremonies were generally under ground. The Temple of Solomon presented a symbolic image of the Universe; and resembled, in its arrangements and furnit ure, all the temples of the ancient nations that practised the mysterie s. The system of numbers was intimately connected with their religions and worship, and has come down to us in Masonry; though the esoter ic meaning with which the numbers used by us are pregnant is unknown to the vast majority of those who use them. Those numbers were especially employed that had a reference to the Deity, represented his attr ibutes, or figured in the frame-work of the world, in time and space, and formed more or less the bases of that frame-work. These were universally regarded as sacred, being the expression of order and intelli gence, the utterances of Divinity"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Himself. The Holy of Holies of the Temple formed a cube; in which, drawn on a plane surface, there are 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 lines visible, and three sides or faces. It corresponded with the num ber four, by which the ancients presented Nature, it being the number of substances or corporeal forms, and of the elements, the cardinal po ints and seasons, and the secondary colors. The number three everywhere represented the Supreme Being. Hence the name of the Deity, engraven upon the triangular plate, and that sunken into the cube of agate, taught the ancient Mason, and teaches us, that the true knowledge of God, of His nature and His attributes is written by Him upon the leaves of the great Book of Universal Nature, and may be read there by all who are endowed with the requisite amount of intellect and intelligence. This knowledge of God, so written there, and of which Masonry has in all ages been the interpreter, is the Master Mason's Word. Within the Temple, all the arrangements were mystically and symbolically connected with the same system. The vault or ceiling, starred like the firmament, was supported by twelve columns, representing the twelve months of the year. The border that ran around the columns represented the zodiac, and one of the twelve celestial signs was appropriated to each column. The brazen sea was supported by twelve oxen, three looking to each cardinal point of the compass. And so in our day every Masonic Lodge represents the Universe. Each extends, we are told , from the rising to the setting sun, from the South to the North, from the surface of the Earth to the Heavens, and from the same to the centre of the globe. In it are represented the sun, moon, and stars; three great torches in the East, West, and South, forming a triangle, give it light: and, like the Delta or Triangle suspended in the East, and inclosing the Ineffable Name, indicate, by the mathematical equality of the angles and sides, the beautiful and har monious proportions which govern in the aggregate and details of the Un iverse; while those sides and angles represent, by their number, three, t he Trinity of Power, Wisdom, and Harmony, which presided at the buildi ng of this marvellous work These three great lights also represent the great mystery of the three principles, of creation, dissolution or destruction, and reproduction or regenerati on, consecrated by all cr eeds in their numerous Trinities. The luminous pedestal, ligh ted by the perpetual flame wit hin, is a symbol of that light of Reason, given by God to m an, by which he is enabled to read in the Book of Nature the record of the thou ght, the revelation of the attributes of the Deity. The three Masters, Adoniram, Joabert, and Stolkin, are types of the True Mason, who seeks for knowledge from pure motives, and that he may be the better enabled to serve and benefit his fellow-men; while the discontented and presumptuous Masters who were bu ried in the ruins of the arches represent those who strive to acquire it for unholy purposes, to gain power over their fellows, to gratify their pri de, their vanity, or their ambition. The Lion that guarded the Ark and held in his mouth the key wherewith to open it, figuratively represents Solomon, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, who preserved and communicated the key to t he true knowledge of God, of His laws, and of the profound mysteries of the moral and physical Universe. ENOCH [ Khanõc], we are told, walked with God three hundred years, after reaching the age of sixty-five - \"walked with God, and he was no more, for God had taken him.\" His name signified in the Hebrew, INITIATE or INITIATOR. The legend of the columns, of granite and brass or bronze, erected by him, is probably symbolical . That of bronze, which survived the flood, is supposed to symbolize the my steries, of which Masonry is the legitimate successor - from the earliest times the custodian and depository of the great philosophical and religious truths, unknown to the world at large, and handed down from age to age by an unbroken current of tradition, embodied in symbols, emblems, and allegories."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"The legend of this Degree is thus, part ially, interpreted. It is of little importance whether it is in anywise hist orical. For its value consists in the lessons which it inculcates , and the duties which it prescribes to those who receive it. The parables and allegories of the Scriptures are not less valuable than history. Nay, they are more so, because ancient history is little instructive, and truths ar e concealed in and symbolized by the legend and the myth. There are profounder meanings conceal ed in the symbols of this Degree, connected with the philosophical system of the Hebrew Kabalists, which you will learn hereafter, if you should be so fortunate as to advance. They are unfolded in the higher Degrees. The lion [ Arai, Araiah, which also me ans the altar] still holds in his mouth the key of the enigma of the sphynx. But there is one application of this D egree, that you are now entitled to know; and which, remembering that K hürüm, the Master, is the symbol of human freedom, you would probabl y discover for yourself. It is not enough for a people to gain its liberty. It must secure it. It must not intrust it to the keeping, or hold it at the pleasure, of any one man. The keystone of the Royal Arch of the great Temple of Liberty is a fundamental law, charter, or constitution; the expres sion of the fixed habi ts of thought of the people, embodied in a written instru ment, or the result of the slow accretions and the consolidation of c enturies; the same in war as in peace; that cannot be hast ily changed, nor be violated with impunity, but is sacred, like the Ark of the Covenant of God, which none could touch and live. A permanent constitution, rooted in the affections, expressing the will and judgment, and built upon the instincts and settled habits of thought of the people, with an independent judiciary, an elective legislature of two branches, an executive responsible to th e people, and the right of trial by jury, will guarantee the liberti es of a people, if it be virtuous and temperate, without luxury, and without the lust of conquest and dominion, and the follies of visionary theories of impossible perfection. Masonry teaches its Initiate s that the pursuits and occ upations of this life, its activity, care, and ingenuity, the predestined developments of the nature given us by God, tend to promote His great design, in making the world; and are not at war with the grea t purpose of life. It teaches that everything is beautiful in its time, in it s place, in its appointed office; that everything which man is put to do, if ri ghtly and faithfully done, naturally helps to work out his salvation; that if he obeys the genuine principles of his calling, he will be a good ma n: and that it is only by neglect and nonperf ormance of the task set for him by Heaven, by wandering into idle dissipation, or by violating their benefi cent and lofty spirit, that he becomes a bad man. The appointed action of life is the great training of Providence; and if man yields himself to it, he will need neither churches nor ordinances, except for the expression of his religious homage and gratitude. For there is a religion of toil. It is not all drudgery, a mere stretching of the limbs and straining of the sinews to ta sks. It has a meaning and an intent. A living heart pours life-blood into t he toiling arm; and warm affections inspire and mingle with man's labors. They are the home affections. Labor toils a-field, or plies its task in cities, or urges the keels of commerce over wide oceans; but home is its centre; and thither it ever goes with its earnings, with the means of support a nd comfort for others; offerings sacred to the thought of every true man, as a sacrifice at a golden shrine. Many faults there are amidst the toils of life; many harsh and hasty words are uttered; but still the toils go on, weary and ha rd and exasperating as they often are. For in that home is age or sickness, or helpless infancy, or gentle childhood, or feeble woman, that must not want. If man had no other than mere selfish impulses, t he scene of labor which we behold around us would not exist."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"The advocate who fairly and honestly presents his case, with feeling of true self-respect, honor, and conscience, to help the tribunal on towards the right conclusion, with a conviction that God's just ice reigns there, is acting a religious part, leading that day religious life; or else right and justice are no part of religion Whether , during all that day, he has once appealed, in form or in terms, to his conscience, or not; whether he has once spoken of religion and God, or no t; if there has been the inward purpose, the conscious intent and de sire, that sacred justice should triumph, he has that day led a good and religious life, and made most a essential contribution to that religion of life and of society, the cause of equity between man and man, and of tr uth and right action in the world. Books, to be of religious tendency in the Masonic sense, need not be books of sermons, of pious exercises, or of prayers. What ever inculcates pure, noble, and patriotic sentiments, or touches the heart with the beauty of virtue, and the excellence of an upright life, accords with the religion of Masonry, and is the Gospel of literatur e and art. That Gospel is preached from many a book and painting, from ma ny a poem and fiction, and review and newspaper; and it is a painful error and miserable narrowness, not to recognize these wide-spread agencies of Heaven's providing; not to see and welcome these many-handed coadjutors, to the great and good cause. The oracles of God do not speak from the pulpit alone. There is also a religion of society. In business, there is much more than sale, exchange, price, payment; for th ere is the sacred faith of man in man. When we repose perfect confidence in the integrity of another; when we feel that he will not swerve from the right, frank, straightforward, conscientious course, for any temptation; his integrity and conscientiousness are the image of God to us; and when we believe in it, it is as great and generous an act, as when we believe in the rectitude of the Deity. In gay assemblies for amusement, the good affections of life gush and mingle. If they did not, these gatherin g-places would be as dreary and repulsive as the caves and dens of outlaws and robbers. When friends meet, and hands are warmly pressed, and the eye kindles and the countenance is suffused with gladness, there is a religion between their hearts; and each loves and worships the True and Good that is in the other. It is not policy, or self-interest, or selfishness that spreads such a charm around that meeting, but the halo of bright a nd beautiful affection. The same splendor of kindly liking, and affectionate regard, shines like the soft overarching sky, over all the worl d; over all places where men meet, and walk or toil together; not over lovers' bowers and marriage-altars alone, not over the homes of purity and tenderness alone; but over all tilled fields, and busy work shops, and dusty highways, and pav ed streets. There is not a worn stone upon the si dewalks, but has been the altar of such offerings of mutual kindness; nor a wo oden pillar or iron railing against which hearts beating with af fection have not leaned. How many soever other elements there are in the stream of life flowing through these channels, that is surely here and everywhere; honest, heartfelt, disinterested, inexpr essible affection. Every Masonic Lodge is a temple of religion; and its teachings are instruction in religion. For here are incu lcated disinterestedn ess, affection, toleration, devotedness, patriotism, tr uth, a generous sympathy with those who suffer and mourn, pity for the fall en, mercy for the erring, relief for those in want, Faith, Hope, and Charit y. Here we meet as brethren, to learn to know and love each other. Here we greet each other gladly, are lenient to each other's faults, regardfu l of each other's feelings, ready to relieve each other's wants. This is the tr ue religion revealed to the ancient patriarchs; which Masonry has taught for many centuries, and which it will continue to teach as long as time endures.

Certainly there are many evils and bad passions, and much hate and contempt and unkindness everywhere in the world. We cannot refuse to see the evil -that is in life. But all is no t evil. We still see God in the world. There is good amidst the evil. The ha nd of mercy leads wealth to the hovels of poverty and so rrow. Truth and simplicity live amid many wiles and sophistries. There are good hear ts underneath gay robes, and under tattered garments also. Love clasps the hand of love, amid a ll the envyings and distractions of showy competition; fidelity, pity, and sympathy hold the long night-watch by the bedside of the suffering neig hbor, amidst the surrounding poverty and squalid misery. Devoted men go fr om city to city to nurse those smitten down by the terrible pestilenc e that renews at intervals its mysterious marches. Women well-born and delicately nurtured nursed the wounded soldiers in hospitals, before it became fashionable to do so; and even poor lost women, whom God alone loves and pities, tend the plaguestricken with a patient and generous heroism. Masonry and its kindred Orders teach men to love each other, feed the hungry, clothe the naked, comfort the sick, and bury the friend less dead. Everywhere God finds and blesses the kindly office, the pity ing thought, and the loving heart. There is an element of good in all men's lawful pursuits and a divine spirit breathing in all their lawful affecti ons. The ground on which they tread is holy ground. There is a natural religi on of life, answering, with however many a broken tone, to the religion of nature. There is a beauty and glory in Humanity., in man, answering, with however many a mingling shade, to the loveliness of soft landscapes and swelling hills, and the wondrous Men may be virtuous, self-improving, an d religious in their employments. Precisely for that, those employments were made. All their social relations, friendship, love , the ties of family, were made to be holy. They may be religious, not by a kind of protest and resistance against their several voca tions; but by conformity to their true spirit. Those vocations do not exclude religion; but demand it, for their own perfection. They may be religious labor ers, whether in field or factory; religious physicians, lawyers, sculpt ors, poets, painters, and musicians. They may be religious in all the toils and in all the amusements of life. Their life may be a religion; the broad eart h its altar; its incense the very breath of life; its fires ever kind led by the bright ness of Heaven. Bound up with our poor, frail life, is the mighty thought that spurns the narrow span of all visible existence. Ever the soul reaches outward, and asks for freedom. It looks forth from the narrow and grated windows of sense, upon the wide immeasurable crea tion; it knows that around it and beyond it lie outstretched the in finite and everlasting paths. Everything within us and without us ought to stir our minds to admiration and wonder. We are a mystery en compassed with mysteries. The connection of mind with matter is a my stery; the wonderful telegraphic communication between the brain and ev ery part of the body, the power and action of the will. Ever y familiar step is more than a story in a land of enchantment. The power of movement is as mysterious as the power of thought. Memory, and dreams that are the indistinct echoes of dead memories are alike inexplicable. Universal harmony springs from infinite complication. The momentum of every step we take in our dwelling contributes in part to the order of the Universe. We are connected by ties of thought, and even of matter and it s forces, with the whole boundless Universe and all the past and coming generations of men. The humblest object beneath our eye as completely defies our scrutiny as the economy of the most distant star. Every leaf and every blade of grass holds within itself secrets which no hu man penetration will ever fathom. No man can tell what is its principle of lif e. No man can know what his power of secretion is. Both are inscrutable mysteries. Wherever we place our hand we lay it upon the locked bosom of mystery.

A Mason's great business with life is to read the book of its teaching; to find that life is not the doing of drudger ies, but the hearing of oracles. The old mythology is but a leaf in that book; for it peopled the world with spiritual natures; and sci ence, many-leaved, still sp reads before us the same tale of wonder. We shall be just as happy hereafter, as we are pure and upright, and no more, just as happy as our character prepares us to be, and no more. Our moral, like our mental character, is nut formed in a moment; it is the habit of our minds; the result of many th oughts and feelings and efforts, bound together by many natural and strong ti es. The great law of Retribution is, that all coming experience is to be af fected by every pres ent feeling; every future moment of being must answer for every present moment; one moment, sacrificed to vice, or lost to improvement, is forever sacrificed and lost; an hour's delay to enter the righ t path, is to put us back so far, in the everlasting pursuit of happiness; and every sin, even of the best men, is to be thus answered for, if not according to the fu ll measure of its illdesert, yet according to a rule of unbending rectitude and impartiality. The law of retribution presses upon every m an, whether he thinks of it or not. It pursues him through all the cour ses of life, with a step that never falters nor tires, and with an eye that never sleeps. If it were not so, God's government would not be impartial; 'there would be no discrimination; no moral dominion; no light shed upon the mysteries of Providence. Whatsoever a man soweth, that, and not something else, shall he reap. That which we are doing, good or evil, grave or gay, that which we do today and shall do to-morrow; each though t, each feeling, each action, each event; every passing hour, every breathi ng moment; all are contributing to form the character according to which we are to be judged. Every particle of influence that goes to form that aggregate, - our character, - will, in that future scrutiny, be sifted out from t he mass; and, particle by particle, with ages perhaps intervening, fall a distinct contribution to the sum of our joys or woes. Thus every idle word and id le hour will give answer in the judgment. Let us take care, therefore, what we sow. An evil tempta tion comes upon us; the opportunity of unrigh teous gain, or of unhallowed indulgence, either in the sphere of bus iness or pleasure, of society or solitude. We yield; and pl ant a seed of bitterness and sorrow. To-morrow it will threaten discovery. Agit ated and alarmed, we cove r the sin, and bury it deep in falsehood and hypocrisy. In th e bosom where it lies concealed, in the fertile soil of kindred vices, that si n dies not, but thrives and grows; and other and still other germs of evil gath er around the accurs ed root; until, from that single seed of corruption, th ere springs up in the soul all that is horrible in habitual lying, knavery, or vice. Loathingly, often, we take each downward step; but a frightful power urges us onward; and the hell of debt, disease, ignominy, or remorse gathers its shadows around Our steps even on earth; and are yet but th e beginnings of sorrows. The evil deed may be done in a single moment; but conscience never dies, memory never sleeps; guilt never can become innocence; and remorse can never whisper peace. Beware, thou who art tempted to evil! Beware what thou layest up for the future! Beware what thou layest up in the archives of eternity! Wrong not thy neighbor! lest the thought of him t hou injurest, and who suffers by thy act, be to thee a pang which years will no t deprive of its bitterness!

[Perfect Elu.] It is for each individual Mason to discover the secret of Ma- sonry, by reflection upon its symb ols and a wise consideration and analysis of what is said and done in the work. Masonry does not inculcate her truths. She states them, once and briefly; or hints them, perhaps, darkly; or interposes a cloud between them and eyes that would be dazzled by th em. \"Seek, and ye shall find,\" knowledge and the truth. The practical object of Masonr y is the physical and moral amelioration and the intellectual and spiritual improvement of individuals and society. Neither c an be effected, except by the dissemination of truth. It is fa lsehood in doctrines and fallacy in principles, to which most of the miseries of men and the mis- fortunes of nations are owing. Public opinion is rarely right on any point; and there are and always will be important truths to be substituted in that opinion in the place of many errors and absurd and injurious prejudices. There are few truths that public opinion has not at some time hated and persecuted as heresies; and few errors that have not at some time seemed to it truths radi- ant from the immediate presence of God. There are moral mala- dies, also, of man and society, t he treatment of which requires not only boldness, but also, and mo re, prudence and discretion; since they are more the fruit of false and pernicious doctrines, moral, political, and religious, than of vicious inclinations. Much of the Masonic secret ma nifests itself, without speech revealing it to him who even partially comprehends all the De- grees in proportion as he receives them; and particularly to those who advance to the highest Degrees of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. That Rite raises a corner of the veil, even in the Degree of Apprentice; for it there declares that Masonry is a worship. Masonry labors to improve the social order by enlightening men's minds, warming their hearts with the love of the good, in- spiring them with the great principle of human fraternity, and requiring of its disciples that t heir language and actions shall con- form to that principle, that they shall enlighten each other, con-"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"trol their passions, abhor vice , and pity the vicious man as one afflicted with a deplorable malady. It is the universal, eternal, immu table religion, such as God planted it in the heart of universal humanity. No creed has ever been long-lived that was not built on this foundation. It is the base, and they are the superstructure. \"Pure religion and unde- filed before God and the Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.\" \"Is not this the fast th at I have chosen ? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye br eak every yoke ?\" The ministers of this religion are all Masons who comprehend it and are devoted to it; its sacrifices to God are good works, the sacrifices of the base and disorderly passions, the offering up of self-interest on the altar of humanity, and perpetua l efforts to attain to all the moral perfection of which man is capable. To make honor and duty the st eady beacon-lights that shall guide your life-vessel over the sto rmy seas of time; to do that which it is right to do, not because it will insure you success, or bring with it a reward, or gain the applause of men, or be \"the best policy,\" more prudent or mo re advisable; but because it is right, and therefore ought to be done; to war incessantly against error, intolerance, ignorance, and vice, and yet to pity those who err, to be tolerant even of intole rance, to teach the ignorant, and to labor to reclaim the vicious, ar e some of the duties of a Mason. A good Mason is one that can look upon death, and see its face with the same countenance with wh ich he hears its story; that can endure all the labors of hi s life with his soul supporting his body, that can equally despise riches when he hath them and when he hath them not;that is, not sadder if they are in his neigh- bor's exchequer, nor more lifted up if they shine around about his own walls; one that is not mo ved with good fortune coming to him, nor going from him; that can look upon another man's lands with equanimity and pleasure, as if they were his own; and yet look upon his own, and use them too, just as if they were another man's; that neither spends his goo ds prodigally and foolishly, nor yet keeps them avariciously and like a miser; that weighs not benefits by weight and number, but by the mind and circumstances of him who confers t hem; that never thinks his charity expen- sive, if a worthy person be th e receiver; that does nothing for opinion's sake, but everything for conscience, being as careful of his thoughts as of his acting in markets and theatres, and in as much awe of himself as of a w hole assembly; that is, bountiful and cheerful to his friends, and charitable and apt to forgive his enemies; that loves his country, consults its honor, and obeys its laws, and desires and endeavors nothing more than that he may do his duty and honor God. And such a Mason may reckon his life to be the life of a man, a nd compute his months, not by the course of the sun, but by th e zodiac and circle of his vir- tues. The whole world is but one republic , of which each nation is a family, and every individual a child. Masonry, not in anywise derogating from the differing duties which the diversity of states requires, tends to create a new people, which, composed of men of many nations and tongues, shall a ll be bound together by the bonds of science, morality, and virtue. Essentially philanthropic, philos ophical, and progressive, it has for the basis of its dogma a firm belief in the existence of God and his providence, and of the i mmortality of the soul; for its object, the dissemination of mora l, political, philosophical, and"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"religious truth, and the practice of all the virtues. In every age, its device has been, \"Liberty, Equa lity, Fraternity,\" with constitu- tional government, law, order, di scipline, and subordination to legitimate authority--government and not anarchy. But it is neither a political party nor a religious sect. It braces all parties and all sects, to form from among them all a vast fraternal association. It recogni zes the dignity of human nature, and man's right to such freedom as he is fitted for; and it knows nothing that should plac e one man below another, except ignorance, debasement, and crime, and the necessity of subordina- tion to lawful will and authority. It is philanthropic; for it recogn izes the great truth that all men are of the same origin, have common interests, and should co-operate together to the same end. Therefore it teaches its members to love one another, to give to each other mutual assistance and support in all the circumstances of life, to share each other's pains and sorrows, as well as their joys and pleasures; to guard the reputations, respect the opinions, and be perfectly tolerant of the errors, of each other, in matters of faith and beliefs. It is philisophical because it teac hes the great Truths concern- ing the nature and existence of o ne Supreme Deity, and the exist- ence and immortality of the soul. It revives the Academy of Plato and the wise teachings of Socrates. It reiterates the max- ims of Pythagoras, Co nfucius, and Zoroaster, and reverentially enforces the sublime lessons of Him who died upon the Cross. The ancients thought that unive rsal humanity acted under the influence of two opposing Principl es, the Good and the Evil: of which the Good urged men toward Truth, Independence, and De- votedness and the Evil toward Fa lsehood, Servility, and Selfish- ness. Masonry represents the Good Principle and constantly wars against the evil one. It is the Hercules, the Osiris, the Apollo, the Mithras, and the Ormuzd, at everlasting and deadly feud with the demons of ignorance, bruta lity, baseness, falsehood, slavish- ness of soul, intolerance, supers tition, tyranny, meanness, the in- solence of wealth, and bigotry. When despotism and superstition, twin-powers of evil and dark- ness, reigned everywhere and seemed invincible and immortal, it invented, to avoid persec ution, the mysteries, that is to say, the allegory, the symbol, and the em blem, and transmitted its doc- trines by the secret mode of init iation. Now, reta ining its ancient symbols, and in part its ancient ce remonies, it displays in every civilized country its banner, on whic h in letters of living light its great principles are written; and it smiles at the puny efforts of kings and popes to crush it out by excommunication and inter- diction. Man's views in regard to God, will contain only so much posi- tive truth as the human mind is capable of receiving; whether that truth is attained by the exer cise of reason, or communicated by revelation. It must necessarily be both limited and alloyed, to bring it within the competence of finite human intelligence. Be- ing finite, we can form no correct or adequate idea of the Infinite; being material, we can form no clea r conception of the Spiritual. We do believe in and know the infinity of Space and Time, and the spirituality of the Soul; but the idea of that infinity and spirituality eludes us. Even Omni potence cannot infuse infinite conceptions into finite minds; nor can God, without first entirely changing the conditions of our being, pour a complete and full knowledge of His own nature and attributes into the narrow capacity of a human soul. Hum an intelligence could not grasp"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"it, nor human language express it. The visible is, necessarily, the measure of the invisible. The consciousness of the individual reveals itself alone. His knowledge cannot pass beyond th e limits of his own being. His conceptions of other things and other beings are only his concep- tions. They are not those things or beings themselves. The living principle of a living Universe mu st be INFINITE; while all our ideas and conceptions are finite, and applicable only to finite beings. The Deity is thus not an object of knowledge, but of faith; not to be approached by the understan ding, but by the moral sense; not to be conceived, but to be fe lt. All attempts to embrace the Infinite in the conception of the Finite are, and must be only ac- commodations to the frailty of man. Shrouded from human com- prehension in an obscurity from which a chastened imagination is awed back, and Thought retreats in conscious weakness, the Divine Nature is a theme on which man is little entitled to dog- matize. Here the philosophic Inte llect becomes most painfully aware of its own insufficiency. And yet it is here that man most dogmatizes, clas sifies and de- scribes God's attributes, makes out his map of God's nature, and his inventory of God's qualities, feelings, impulses, and passions; and then hangs and burns his brothe r, who, as dogmatically as he, makes out a different map and inventory. The common under- standing has no humility. Its God is an incarnate Divinity. Im- perfection imposes its own limitat ions on the Illimitable, and clothes the Inconceivable Spirit of the Universe in forms that come within the grasp of the senses and the intellect, and are derived from that infinite and imperfect nature which is but God's creation. We are all of us, though not a ll equally, mistaken. The cher- ished dogmas of each of us are not, as we fondly suppose, the pure truth of God; but simply our ow n special form of error, our guesses at truth, the refracted and fragmentary rays of light that have fallen upon our own minds. Our little systems have their day, and cease to be; they are but broken lights of God; and He is more than they. Perfect truth is not attainable anywhere. We style this Degree that of Perfec tion; and yet what it teaches is imperfect and defective. Yet we ar e not to relax in the pursuit of truth, nor contentedly acquiesce in error. It is our duty always to press forward in the search; for though absolute truth is unat- tainable, yet the amount of error in our views is capable of pro- gressive and perpetual diminution; and thus Masonry is a con- tinual struggle toward the light. All errors are not equally innocuous. That which is most in- jurious is to entertain unwort hy conceptions of the nature and attributes of God; and it is this that Masonry symbolizes by igno- rance of the True Word. The true word of a Mason is, not the entire, perfect, absolute truth in regard to God; but the highest and noblest conception of Him that our minds are capable of forming; and this word is Ineffable, because one man cannot communicate to another his own conc eption of Deity; since every man's conception of God must be pr oportioned to his mental cul- tivation and intellectual powers, and moral excellence. God is, as man conceives Him, the reflected image of man himself. For every man's conception of God must vary with his mental cultivation and mental powers. If any one contents himself with any lower image than hi s intellect is capable of grasping, then he contents himself with that which is false to him, as well as false in fact. If lower than he can reach, he must needs feel it to be false. And if we, of the nineteenth cent ury after Christ, adopt the con-"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"ceptions of the nineteenth century before Him; if our conceptions of God are those of the ignorant , narrow-minded, and vindictive Israelite; then we think worse of God, and have a lower, meaner, and more limited view of His natur e, than the faculties which He has bestowed are capable of grasping. The highest view we can form is nearest to the truth. If we acquiesce in any lower one, we acquiesce in an untruth. We fe el that it is an affront and an indignity to Him, to conceive of Him as cruel, short-sighted, ca- pricious, and unjust; as a jealous, an angry, a vindictive Being. When we examine our conceptions of His character, if we can conceive of a loftier, nobler, higher, more beneficent, glorious, and magnificent character, then this la tter is to us the true conception of Deity; for nothing can be im agined more excellent than He. Religion, to obtain currency and influence with the great mass of mankind, must needs be alloyed with such an amount of error as to place it far below the st andard attainable by the higher human capacities. A religion as pure as the loftiest and most cul- tivated human reason could discern , would not be comprehended by, or effective over, the less educated portion of mankind. What is Truth to the philosopher, wo uld not be Truth, nor have the effect of Truth, to the peasan t. The religion of the many must necessarily be more incorrect than t hat of the refined and reflective few, not so much in its essence as in its forms, not so much in the spiritual idea which lies latent at the bottom of it, as in the sym- bols and dogmas in which that idea is embodied. The truest religion would, in many points, not be comprehended by the igno- rant, nor consolatory to them, nor guiding and supporting for them. The doctrines of the Bible are often not clothed in the language of strict truth, but in th at which was fittest to convey to a rude and ignorant people the practical essentia ls of the doc- trine. A perfectly pure faith, free from all extraneous admixtures, a system of noble theism and lofty morality, would find too little preparation for it in the common mind and heart, to admit of prompt reception by the masses of mankind; and Truth might not have reached us, if it had not borrowed the wings of Error. The Mason regards God as a Moral Governor, as well as an Original Creator; as a God at ha nd, and not merely one afar off in the distance of infinite space, and in the remoteness of Past or Future Eternity. He conceive s of Him as taking a watchful and presiding interest in the affairs of the world, and as influenc- ing the hearts and actions of men. To him, God is the great Source of the World of Life and Mat- ter; and man, with his wonderful corporeal and mental frame, His direct work. He believes that God has made men with differ- ent intellectual capacities, and enabled some, by superior intellect- ual power, to see and originate truths which are hidden from the mass of men. He belie ves that when it is His will that mankind should make some great step forward, or achieve some pregnant discovery, He calls into being so me intellect of more than ordi- nary magnitude and power, to give birth to new ideas, and grander conceptions of the Truths vital to Humanity. We hold that God has so ordere d matters in this beautiful and harmonious, but myster iously-governed Universe, that one great mind after another will arise, from time to time, as such are needed, to reveal to men the tr uths that are wanted, and the amount of truth than can be born e. He so arranges, that nature and the course of events shall se nd men into the world, endowed with that higher mental and mora l organization, in which grand truths, and sublime gl eams of spiritual li ght will spontaneously and inevitably arise. These speak to men by inspiration."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Whatever Hiram really was, he is the type, perhaps an imag- inary type, to us, of humanity in its highest phase; an exemplar of what man may and should become, in the course of ages, in his progress toward the realization of his destiny; an individual gifted with a glorious intellect, a noble soul, a fine organization, and a perfectly balanced moral being; an earnest of what humanity may be, and what we believe it will hereafter be in God's good time; the possibility of the race made real. The Mason believes that God has arranged this glorious but per- plexing world with a purpose, and on a plan. He holds that every man sent upon this earth, and es pecially every man of superior capacity, has a duty to perform, a mission to fulfill, a baptism to be baptized with; that every great and good man possesses some portion of God's truth, which he mu st proclaim to the world, and which must bear fruit in his own bosom. In a true and simple sense, he believes all the pure, wise, and intellectual to be inspired, and to be so for the instruction, advancement, and elevation of mankind. That kind of inspirati on, like God's omnipresence, is not limited to the few writers cl aimed by Jews, Christians, or Moslems, but is co-extensive with the race. It is the consequence of a faithful use of our faculties. Each man is its subject, God is its source, and Truth its only test. It differs in degrees, as the intellectual endowments, the moral wealth of the soul, and the de- gree of cultivation of those endowments and faculties differ. It is limited to no sect, age, or natio n. It is wide as the world and common as God. It was not given to a few men, in the infancy of mankind, to monopolize inspir ation, and bar God out of the soul. We are not born in the dotage and decay of the world. The stars are beautiful as in their prime; the most ancient Heavens are fresh and strong. God is st ill everywhere in nature. Wher- ever a heart beats with love, wherever Faith and Reason utter their oracles, there is God, as formerly in the hearts of seers and prophets. No soil on earth is so holy as the good man's heart; nothing is so full of God. This inspiration is not given to the learned alone, not alone to the great and wise, but to every faithful child of God. Certain as the open eye drinks in the light, do the pure in heart see God; and he who lives truly, feels Him as a pres- ence within the soul. The conscienc e is the very voice of Deity. Masonry, around whose altars the Christian, the Hebrew, the Moslem, the Brahmin, t he followers of Confucius and Zoroaster, can assemble as brethren and unite in prayer to the one God who is above all the Baalim, must needs leave it to each of its Initiates to look for the foundation of hi s faith and hope to the written scriptures of his own religion. Fo r itself it finds those truths definite enough, which are writte n by the finger of God upon the heart of man and on the pages of the book of nature. Views of religion and duty, wrought out by th e meditations of the studious, confirmed by the allegiance of the good and wise, stamped as sterling by the response they fi nd in every uncorrupted mind, com- mend themselves to Masons of every creed, and may well be ac- cepted by all. The Mason does not pretend to dogmatic certainty, nor vainly imagine such certainty attainable. He considers that if there were no written revelation, he coul d safely rest the hopes that ani- mate him and the principles that guide him, on the deductions of reason and the convictions of in stinct and consciou sness. He can find a sure foundation for his relig ious belief, in these deductions of the intellect and convictions of the heart. For reason proves to him the existence and attributes of God; and those spiritual instincts which he feels are the voice of God in his soul, infuse"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"into his mind a sense of his relati on to God, a conviction of the beneficence of his Creator and Pr eserver, and a hope of future ex- istence; and his reason and con science alike unerringly point to virtue as the highest good, and the destined aim and purpose of man's life. He studies the wonders of the Heavens, the frame-work and revolutions of the Earth, the my sterious beauties and adaptations of animal existence, the moral and material constitution of the human creature, so fearfully and wonderfully made; and is satis- fied that God IS; and that a Wise and Good Being is the author of the starry Heavens above him, and of the moral world within him; and his mind finds an adeq uate foundation fo r its hopes, its worship, its principles of action, in the far-stretching Universe, in the glorious firmament, in the deep, full soul, bursting with un- utterable thoughts. These are truths whic h every reflecting mind will unhesitatingly receive, as not to be surpassed, nor capable of improvement; and fitted, if obeyed, to make earth indeed a Paradise, and man only a little lower than the angels. T he worthlessness of ceremonial observances, and the ne cessity of active vi rtue; the enforcement of purity of heart as the security for purity of life, and of the government of the thoughts, as t he originators and forerunners of action; universal philanthropy, re quiring us to love all men, and to do unto others that and that only which we should think it right, just, and generous for them to do unto us; forgiveness of injuries; the necessity of self-sac rifice in the discharge of duty; humility; genuine sincerity, and bei ng that which we seem to be; all these sublime precepts need no miracle, no voice from the clouds, to recommend them to our allegiance, or to assure us of their divine origin. They command obedience by virtue of their inherent rectitu de and beauty; and have been, and are, and will be the law in every age and every country of the world. God revealed them to man in the beginning. To the Mason, God is our Fa ther in Heaven, to be Whose especial children is the sufficient reward of the peacemakers, to see Whose face the highest hope of the pure in heart; Who is ever at hand to strengthen His true worshippers; to Whom our most fer- vent love is due, our most humble and patient submission; Whose most acceptable worship is a pure and pitying heart and a benefi- cent life; in Whose constant presence we live and act, to Whose merciful disposal we are resig ned by that death which, we hope and believe, is but the entrance to a better life; and Whose wise decrees forbid a man to lap his soul in an elysium of mere indolent content. As to our feelings toward Him and our conduct toward man, Masonry teaches little about which men can differ, and little from which they can dissent. He is our Father; and we are all breth- ren. This much lies open to the most ignorant and busy, as fully as to those who have most leis ure and are most learned. This needs no Priest to teach it, and no authority to indorse it; and if every man did that only which is co nsistent with it, it would exile barbarity, cruelty, intolerance, uncharitableness, perfidy, treach- ery, revenge, selfishness, and all their kindred vices and bad pas- sions beyond the confines of the world. The true Mason, sincerely hold ing that a Supreme God created and governs this world, believes also that He governs it by laws, which, though wise, just, and beneficent, are yet steady, unwaver- ing, inexorable. He believes that his agonies and sorrows are or- dained for his chastening, his st rengthening, his elaboration and development; because they are the necessary results of the opera-"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"tion of laws, the best that coul d be devised for the happiness and purification of the species, and to give occasion and opportunity for the practice of all the virt ues, from the homeliest and most common, to the noblest and most sublime; or perhaps not even that, but the best adapted to work out the vast, awful, glorious, eternal designs of the Great Spirit of the Universe. He believes that the ordained operations of nat ure, which have brought misery to him, have, from the very unswerving tranquility of their career, showered blessings and sunshine upon many another path; that the unrelenting chariot of Time, which has crushed or maimed him in its allotted course, is pressing onward to the accomplish- ment of those serene and mighty pu rposes, to have contributed to which, even as a victim, is an honor and a recompense. He takes this view of Time and Nature and God, and yet bears his lot with- out murmur or distrust; because it is a portion of a system, the best possible, because ordained by God. He does not believe that God loses sight of him, while su perintending the march of the great harmonies of the Universe; nor that it was not foreseen, when the Universe was created, its laws enacted, and the long suc- cession of its operations pre-ordai ned, that in the great march of those events, he would suffer pain and undergo calamity. He be- lieves that his individual good enter ed into God's consideration, as well as the great cardinal results to which the course of all things is tending. Thus believing, he has attained an eminence in virtue, the high- est, amid passive excellence, which humanity can reach. He finds his reward and his support in the reflection that he is an unreluc- tant and self-sacrificing co-operat or with the Creator of the Uni- verse; and in the noble consciousne ss of being worthy and capable of so sublime a conception, yet so sad a destiny. He is then truly entitled to be called a Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Mason. He is content to fall ear ly in the battle, if his body may but form a stepping-stone for the futu re conquests of humanity. It cannot be that God, Who, we ar e certain, is perfectly good, can choose us to suffer pain, unless either we are ourselves to re- ceive from it an antidote to what is evil in ourselves, or else as such pain is a necessary part in the scheme of the Universe, which as a whole is good. In either case, the Mason receives it with submission. He would not suffer unless it was ordered so. What- ever his creed, if he believes that God is, and that He cares for His creatures, he cannot doubt tha t; nor that it would not have been so ordered, unless it was either better for himself, or for some other persons, or for some things. To complain and lament is to murmur against God's will, and worse than unbelief. The Mason, whose mind is cast in a nobler mould than those of the ignorant and unreflecting, and is instinct with a diviner life,- who loves truth more than rest, and the peace of Heaven rather than the peace of Eden,--to whom a loftier being brings severer cares,--who knows that man does not live by pleasure or content alone, but by the presence of the power of God,--must cast be- hind him the hope of any other r epose or tranquillit y, than that which is the last reward of long agonies of thought; he must re- linquish all prospect of any Heaven save that of which trouble is the avenue and portal; he must gird up his loins, and trim his lamp, for a work that must be done, and must not be negligently done. If he does not like to live in the furnished lodgings of tra- dition, he must build his own house, his own system of faith and thought, for himself. The hope of success, and not the hope of reward, should be our stimulating and sustaining power. Our object, and not ourselves,"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"should be our inspiring thought. Selfishness is a sin, when tem- porary, and for time. Spun out to eternity, it does not become celestial prudence. We should toil and die, not for Heaven or Bliss, but for Duty. In the more frequent cases, where we have to join our efforts to those of thousands of others, to contribute to the carrying forward of a great cause; merely to till the ground or sow the seed for a very distant harvest, or to prepare the way for the future advent of some great amendment; the amount which each one contrib- utes to the achievement of ultima te success, the portion of the price which justice should assign to each as his especial produc- tion, can never be accurately asce rtained. Perhaps few of those who have ever labored, in the patience of secrecy and silence, to bring about some political or soci al change, which they felt con- vinced would ultimately prove of vast service to humanity, lived to see the change effected, or th e anticipated good flow from it. Fewer still of them were able to pronounce w hat appreciable weight their several e fforts contributed to the achievement of the change desired. Many will doubt, whether, in truth, these exer- tions have any influence whatev er; and, discouraged, cease all active effort. Not to be thus discouraged, th e Mason must labor to elevate and purify his motives, as well as sedulously cherish the convic- tion, assuredly a true one, that in this world there is no such thing as effort thrown away; that in a ll labor there is profit; that all sincere exertion, in a righteous and unselfish cause, is necessarily followed, in spite of all appearanc e to the contrary, by an appro- priate and proportionate success; that no bread cast upon the waters can be wholly lost; that no seed planted in the ground can fail to quicken in due time and measure; and that, however we may, in moments of despondency, be apt to doubt, not only whether our cause will triumph, but whether, if it does, we shall have contributed to its trium ph,--there is One, Who has not only seen every exertion we have made, but Who can assign the exact degree in which each soldier has assisted to gain the great victory over social evil. No good work is done wholly in vain. The Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Mason will in nowise deserve that honorable title, if he has not that strength, that will, that self-sustaining energy; that Faith, that feeds upon no earthly hope, nor ever thinks of victory, but, content in its own consum- mation, combats, because it ought to combat, rejoicing fights, and still rejoicing falls. The Augean Stables of the Worl d, the accumulated uncleanness and misery of centuries, require a mighty river to cleanse them thoroughly away; every drop we contribute aids to swell that river and augment its force, in a degree appreciable by God, though not by man; and he whos e zeal is deep and earnest, will not be over-anxious that his i ndividual drops should be distin- guishable amid the mighty mass of cleansing and fertilizing waters; far less that, for the sake of distinction, it should flow in ineffective singleness away. The true Mason will not be care ful that his name should be inscribed upon the mite which he casts into the treasury of God. It suffices him to know that if he has labored, with purity of pur- pose, in any good cause, he must have contributed to its success; that the degree in which he has contributed is a matter of infi- nitely small concern; and still mo re, that the co nsciousness of having so contributed, however obs curely and unnoticed, is his sufficient, even if it be his sole, reward. Let every Grand Elect,"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Perfect, and Sublime Mason cherish this faith. It is a duty. It is the brilliant and never-dying light that shines within and through the symbolic pedestal of alabaster, on which reposes the perfect cube of agate, symbol of duty, inscribed with the divine name of God. He who industriously sows and reaps is a good laborer, and worthy of his hire. But he who sows that which shall be reaped by others, by th ose who will know not of and care not for the sower, is a laborer of a nobler order, and, worthy of a more excellent reward. The Mason does not exhort others to an ascetic undervaluing of this life, as an insignificant and unworthy porti on of existence; for that demands feelings which ar e unnatural, and which, there- fore, if attained, must be morbid, and if merely professed, insin- cere; and teaches us to look rather to a future life for the com- pensation of social evils, than to this life for their cure; and so does injury to the cause of virtue and to that of social progress. Life is real, and is earnest, and it is full of duties to be performed. It is the beginning of our immo rtality. Those only who feel a deep interest a nd affection for this worl d will work resolutely for its amelioration; those whose affe ctions are transferred to Heaven, easily acquiesce in the miseries of earth, deeming them hopeless, befitting, and ordained; and console themselves with the idea of the ammends which are one day to be theirs. It is a sad truth, that those most decidedly given to spiritual contemplation, and to making religion rule in their heart s, are often most apathetic to- ward all improvement of this world's systems, and in many cases virtual conservatives of evil, and hostile to political and social re- form, as diverting men's energies from eternity. The Mason does not war with his own instincts, macerate the body into weakness and disorder, and disparage what he sees to be beautiful, knows to be wonderful, and feels to be unspeakably dear and fascinating. He does not put aside the nature which God has given him, to struggle after one which He has not be- stowed. He knows that man is se nt into the world, not a spir- itual, but a composite being, made up of body and mind, the body having, as is fit and needful in a ma terial world, its full, rightful, and allotted share. His life is gui ded by a full recognition of this fact. He does not deny it in bold words, and admit it in weak- nesses and inevitable failings. He believes that his spirituality will come in the next stage of his being, when he pu ts on the spir- itual body; that his body will be dropped at death; and that, until then, God meant it to be commanded and controlled, but not neg- lected, despised, or ignored by th e soul, under pain of heavy con- sequences. Yet the Mason is not indifferent as to the fate of the soul, after its present life, as to its conti nued and eternal being, and the char- acter of the scenes in which t hat being will be fully developed. These are to him topics of the proroundest interest, and the most ennobling and refining contemplat ion. They occupy much of his leisure; and as he becomes familiar with the sorrows and calami- ties of this life, as his hopes are disappointed and his visions of happiness here fade away; when life has wearied him in its race of hours; when he is harassed and toil-worn, and the bur- den of his years weighs heavy on him, the balance of attraction gradually inclines in favor of an other life; and he clings to his lofty speculations with a tenacity of interest which needs no in- junction, and will listen to no pr ohibition. They are the consol- ing privilege of the aspiring, th e wayworn, the weary, and the bereaved. To him the contemplation of the Future lets in light upon the"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Present, and develops the higher portions of his nature. He en- deavors rightly to adjust the re spective claims of Heaven and earth upon his time and thought, so as to give the proper propor- tions thereof to performing the du ties and entering into the inter- ests of this world, and to prepar ation for a better; to the cultiva- tion and purification of his own char acter, and to the public service of his fellow-men. The Mason does not dogmatize, but entertaining and uttering his own convictions, he leaves every one else free to do the same; and only hopes that the time will come, even if afte r the lapse of ages, when all men shall form one great family of brethren, and one law alone, the law of love, shall govern God's whole Uni- verse. Believe as you may, my brother; if the Universe is not, to you, without a God, and if man is not like the beast that perishes, but hath an immortal soul, we welcome you among us, to wear, as we wear, with humility, and conscious of your demeri ts and short- comings, the title of Grand Elect, Perfect, and Sublime Mason. It is not without a secret meaning, that twelve was the num- ber of the Apostles of Christ, an d seventy-two that of his Dis- ciples: that John addressed his r ebukes and menaces to the Seven churches, the number of the Archangels and the Planets. At Babylon were the Seven Stages of Bersippa, a py ramid of Seven stories, and at Ecbatana Seven co ncentric inclosures, each of a different color. Thebes also h ad Seven gates, and the same num- ber is repeated again and again in the account of the flood. The Sephiroth, or Emanations, ten in number, three in one class, and seven in the other, repeat the mystic numbers of Pythagoras. Seven Amschaspands or planetar y spirits were invoked with Ormuzd: Seven inferior Rishis of Hindustan were saved with the head of their family in an ark: and Seven ancient personages alone returned with the British just man, Hu, from the dale of the grievous waters. There were Seven Heliadae, whose father Helias, or the Sun, once crossed the sea in a golden cup; Seven Titans, children of the older Titan, Kronos or Saturn; Seven Corybantes; and Seven Cabiri, so ns of Sydyk; Seven primeval Celestial spirits of the Japanese, and Seven Karlesters who escaped from the deluge and began to be the parents of a new race, on the summit of Mount Al bordi. Seven Cyclopes, also, built the walls of Tiryus. Celus, as quoted by Origen, tells us that the Persians repre- sented by symbols the two-fold motion of the stars, fixed and planetary, and the passage of the Soul through their successive spheres. They erected in their holy caves, in which the mystic rites of the Mithriac Initiations were practised, what he denomi- nates a high ladder, on the Seven steps of which were Seven gates or portals, according to the number of the Seven principal heavenly bodies. Through these the aspirants passed, until they reached the summit of the whole; and this passage was styled a transmigration through the spheres. Jacob saw in his dream a ladder planted or set on the earth, and its top reaching to Heaven, and the Malaki Alohim ascending and descending on it, and above it stood IHUH, declaring Himself to be Ihuh-Alhi Abraham. The word translated ladder, is Salam, from Salal, raised, elev ated, reared up, exalted, piled up into a heap, Aggeravit. Salalah, means a heap, rampart, or other accumulation of earth or stone, artificially made; and Salaa or Salo, is a rock or cliff or boulder, and the name of the city of Petra. There is no ancient Hebrew word to designate a pyramid."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"The symbolic mountain Meru was ascended by Seven steps or stages; and all the pyramids and artifici al tumuli and hillocks thrown up in flat countries were imitations of this fabulous and mystic mountain, for purposes of worship. These were the \"High Places\" so often mentioned in the Hebrew books, on which the idolaters sacrificed to foreign gods. The pyramids were sometimes square, and sometimes round. The sacred Babylonian tower [Magdol], dedicated to the great Father Bal, was an artifici al hill, of pyramidal shape, and Seven stages, built of brick, and each stage of a different color, representing the Seven planetary spheres by the appropriate color of each planet. Meru itself was said to be a single mountain, ter- minating in three peaks, and thus a symbol of the Trimurti. The great Pagoda at Tanjore was of six stories, surmounted by a tem- ple as the seventh, and on this three spires or towers. An ancient pagoda at Deogur was surmounted by a tower, sustaining the mystic egg and a trident. Herodotus tells us that the Temple of Bal at Babylon was a tower composed of Seven towers, resting on an eighth that served as basis, and successively diminishing in size from the bottom to the top; and Strabo tells us it was a pyramid. Faber thinks that the Mithriac ladder was really a pyramid with Seven stages, each provided with a narrow door or aperture, through each of which doors the aspirant passed, to reach the summit, and then descended through similar doors on the opposite side of the pyramid; the ascent and descent of the Soul being thus represented. Each Mithriac cave and all the most ancient temples were tended to symbolize the Univer se, which itself was habitually called the Temple and habitation of Deity. Every temple was the world in miniature; and so the whole world was one grand temple. The most ancient temple s were roofless; and therefore the Persians, Celts, and Scythians strongly disliked artificial cov- ered edifices. Cicero says that Xerxes burned the Grecian tem- ples, on the express ground that the whole world was the Magnifi- cent Temple and Habitation of the Supreme Deity. Macrobius says that the entire Universe was judiciously deemed by many the Temple of God. Plato pronounced the real Temple of the Deity to be the world; and Heraclitus declared that the Universe, varie- gated with animals and plants and stars was the only genuine Temple of the Divinity. How completely the Temple of Solomon was symbolic, is manifest, not only from the cont inual reproduction in it of the sacred numbers and of astrological symbols in the histor- ical descriptions of it; but also, and yet more, from the de- tails of the imaginar y reconstructed edific e, seen by Ezekiel in his vision. The Apocalypse completes the demonstration, and shows the kabalistic meani ngs of the whole. The Sym- bola Architectonica are found on the most ancient edifices; and these mathematical figures and instruments, adopted by the Templars, and identical with those on the gnostic seals and abraxae, connect their dogma wi th the Chaldaic, Syriac, and Egyptian Oriental philosophy. The secret Pythagorean doc- trines of numbers were preserved by the monks of Thibet, by the Hierophants of Egypt and Eleusis, at Jerusalem, and in the circular Chapters of the Dr uids; and they are especially consecrated in that mysterious book, the Apocalypse of Saint John. All temples were surrounded by pillars, recording the number of the constellations, the signs of the zodiac, or the cycles of the"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"planets; and each one was a microcos m or symbol of the Universe, having for roof or ceiling the starred vault of Heaven. All temples were originally open at the top, having for roof the sky. Twelve pillars described th e belt of the zodiac. Whatever the number of the p illars, they were mystical everywhere. At Abury, the Druidic temple reprod uced all the cycles by its col- umns. Around the temples of Chilminar in Persia, of Baalbec, and of Tukhti Schlomoh in Tartary, on the frontier of China, stood forty pillars. On each side of the temple at Paestum were fourteen, recording the Egyptian cycle of the dark and light sides of the moon, as described by Pl utarch; the whole thirty-eight that surrounded them recording t he two meteoric cycles so often found in the Druidic temples. The theatre built by Scaurus, in Greece, was surrounded by 360 columns; the Temple at Mecca, and that at Iona in Scotland, by 360 stones.

XV. KNIGHT OF THE EAST OR OF THE SWORD [Knight of the East, of the Sword, or of the Eagle.] This Degree, like al l others in Masonry, is symbolical. Based upon historical truth and authentic tradition, it is still an alle- gory. The leading lesson of this Degree is Fi delity to obligation, and Constancy and Perseverance und er difficulties and discour- agement. Masonry is engaged in her crusade,--against ignorance, intoler- ance, fanaticism, superstition, un charitableness, and error. She does not sail with th e trade-winds, upon a sm ooth sea, with a steady free breeze, fair for a welcoming harbor; but meets and must overcome many opposing curr ents, baffling wi nds, and dead calms. The chief obstacles to her succe ss are the apathy and faithless- ness of her own selfish children, and t he supine indifference of the world. In the roar and crush and hurry of life and business, and the tumult and uproar of politics, the qui et voice of Masonry is unheard and unheeded. The first lesson whic h one learns, who engages in any great work of refo rm or beneficence, is, that men are essentially careless, lukewarm, and indifferent as to every- thing that does not concern their own per sonal and immediate welfare. It is to si ngle men, and not to the united efforts of many, that all the great works of man, struggling toward perfec- tion, are owing. The enthusias t, who imagines t hat he can in- spire with his own enthusiasm th e multitude that eddies around him, or even the few w ho have associated themselves with him as co-workers, is grievously mistaken ; and most often the conviction of his own mistake is followed by discour agement and disgust. To do all, to pay all, and to suffer all, and then, when despite all obstacles and hindrances, success is accomplished, and a great work done, to see thos e who opposed or looked coldly on it, claim and reap all the praise and reward, is the comm on and almost uni- versal lot of the ben efactor of his kind. He who endeavors to serve, to benefit, and improve the world, is like a swimmer, w ho struggles against a ra pid current, in a river lashed into angry wave s by the winds. Often they roar over his"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"head, often they beat hi m back and baffle hi m. Most men yield to the stress of the current, and floa t with it to t he shore, or are swept over the rapids; and only he re and there the stout, strong heart and vigorous arms struggle on toward ultimate success. It is the motionless and stationary that most frets and impedes the current of progress; the soli d rock or stupid dead tree, rested firmly on the bottom, and around which t he river whirls and eddies: the Masons that doubt and hesitate and are discouraged; that disbelieve in the capability of man to improv e; that are not disposed to toil and labor for the interest and well-being of gen- eral humanity; that expect others to do all, even of that which they do not oppose or ridicule; while they sit, applauding and doing nothing, or perhaps prognosticating failure. There were many such at the rebuilding of t he Temple. There were prophets of evil and misf ortune--the luke warm and the in- different and the apath etic; those who stood by and sneered; and those who thought they did God service enoug h if they now and then faintly applauded. There were ravens croaki ng ill omen, and murmurers who preached the folly and futi lity of the attempt. The world is made up of such; and they were as abundant then as they are now. But gloomy and discouraging as was the prospect, with luke- warmness within and bitter opposition wi thout, our anci ent breth- ren persevered. Let us leave them engaged in the good work, and whenever to us, as to them, su ccess is uncertai n, remote, and contingent, let us stil l remember that the on ly question for us to ask, as true men and Masons, is , what does duty require; and not what will be the result and our reward if we do our duty. Work on, the Sword in one hand, and the Trow el in the other! Masonry teaches that God is a Pa ternal Being, and has an in- terest in his creatures, such as is expressed in the title Father; an interest unknown to al l the systems of Pagan ism, untaught in all the theories of philos ophy; an interest not only in the glorious beings of other spheres, the Sons of Light, the dwellers in Heav- enly worlds, but in us , poor, ignora nt, and unworthy; that He has pity for the erring, pardon fo r the guilty, love for the pure, knowledge for the humble, and prom ises of immortal life for those who trust in and obey Him. Without a belief in Him, life is miserable, the world is dark, the Universe disrobed of its splendors, the intellectual tie to nature broken, the charm of existence di ssolved, the grea t hope of being lost; and the mind, li ke a star struck from its sphere, wanders through the infinite de sert of its conception s, without attraction, tendency, destiny, or end. Masonry teaches, that, of all t he events and acti ons, that take place in the universe of worlds and the eternal su ccession of ages, there is not one, even the minutest, which God did not forever forsee with all the distinctness of immediate vision, combining all, so that man's fr ee will should be His in strument, like all the other forces of nature."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"It teaches that the soul of man is form ed by Him for a pur- pose; that, built up in its propo rtions, and fash ioned in every part, by infinite ski ll, an emanation fr om His spirit, its nature, necessity, and design are virtue. It is so form ed, so moulded, so fashioned, so exactly balanced, so exquisitely proportioned in every part, that sin in troduced into it is mise ry; that vici ous thoughts fall upon it like drops of poison ; and guilty desi res, breathing on its delicate fibres, ma ke plague-spots there, deadly as those of pes- tilence upon the body. It is made for virtue, and not for vice; for purity, as its end, rest, and happiness. No t more vainly would we attempt to make the mountain sink to the level of the valley, the waves of the angry sea turn ba ck from its shores and cease to thunder upon the bea ch, the stars to halt in their swift courses, than to change any one law of our own nature. And one of those laws, uttered by God's voice, and speaking through every nerve and fibre, every force and element, of the moral constitution He has given us, is that we must be upright an d virtuous; that if tempted we must resist; that we must govern our unruly pas- sions, and hold in hand our sensua l appetites. And this is not the dictate of an arbitrary will, nor of some stern a nd impracticable law; but it is part of the grea t firm law of ha rmony that binds the Universe together: not the mere enactmen t of arbitrary will; but the dictate of Infinite Wisdom. We know that God is good, and that what He does is right. This known, the works of creation, the changes of life, the desti- nies of eternity, are al l spread before us, as the dispensations and counsels of infinite love. This known, we then know that the love of God is workin g to issues, like itse lf, beyond all thought and imagination good and glorious; and that the only reason why we do not understand it, is that it is too glori ous for us to un- derstand. God's love takes care for all, and nothing is neglected. It watches over all, provides fo r all, makes wise adaptations for all; for age, for infancy, for maturity, for childhood; in every scene of this or another world; for want, weakness, joy, sorrow, and even for sin. All is good and well and right; and shall be so forever. Through the eternal ages the light of God's beneficence shall shine hereafter, disclosing all, consumma ting all, rewarding all that deserve reward . Then we shall see, wh at now we can only believe. The cloud will be lift ed up, the gate of mystery be passed, and the full li ght shine forever; the light of which that of the Lodge is a symbol. Then th at which caused us trial shall yield us triumph; and that which made our heart ache shall fill us with gladness; and we shall then feel that there, as here, the only true happiness is to learn, to advance, and to improve; which could not happen unless we had commenced with error, ignorance, and imperfection. We mu st pass through the darkness, to reach the light. "},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" XVI. PRINCE OF JERUSALEM. We no longer expect to rebuild the Te mple at Jerusalem. To us it has become bu t a symbol. To us the whole world is God's Temple, as is every upright heart. To establish all over the world the New Law and Reign of Love, Peace, Charity, and Toleration, is to build that Temple, most acce ptable to God, in erecting which Masonry is now engaged . No longer needing to repair to Jerusa- lem to worship, nor to offer up sacrifices and shed blood to propi- tiate the Deity, m an may make the wood s and mountains his Churches and Temples, and wors hip God with a devout gratitude, and with works of c harity and beneficence to his fellow-men. Wherever the humble and contrite heart silent ly offers up its adoration, under the ov erarching trees, in th e open, level meadows, on the hill-side, in the glen, or in the city's swarming streets; there is God's House and the New Jerusalem. The Princes of Jerusalem no long er sit as magistrates to judge between the people; no r is their number li mited to five. But their duties still rema in substantiall y the same, and their insignia and symbols retain thei r old significance. Justice and Equity are still their characte ristics. To reconcile disputes and heal dis- sensions, to restore am ity and peace, to soothe dislikes and soften, prejudices, are their peculiar du ties; and they know that the peacemakers are blessed. Their emblems have been already ex plained. They are part of language of Masonry; the same now as it was when Moses learned it from the Egyptian Hierophants. . Still we observe the spirit of t he Divine law, as thus enunciated to our ancient brethr en, when the Temple was rebuilt, and the book of the la w again opened: \"Execute true judgm ent; and show mer cy and compassion every man to his brother. Oppre ss not the widow nor the father- less, the stranger nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in his heart. Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbor; execute the ju dgment of Truth and Peace in your gates; and love no false oath; for all t hese I hate, saith the Lord. \"Let those who have power rule in righteousness, and Princes in judgment. And let hi m that is a judge be as an hiding-place from the wind, a nd a covert from the tem pest; as rivers of water in a dry place; as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. Then the vile person shall no mo re be called li beral; nor the churl bountiful; and the work of justice shall be peace; and the effect of justice, quiet and secu rity; and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stabili ty of the times. Walk ye righteously and speak"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"uprightly; despise the gains of op pression, shake from your hands the contamination of bribes; stop not your ears against the cries of the oppressed, nor shut your eyes that you may not see the crimes of the great; and you shall dwell on high, and your place of defence be like m unitions of rocks.\" Forget not thes e precepts of the old Law; and especially do not forget, as you advance, that every Mason, howe ver humble, is your brother, and the laboring man your peer ! Remember always that all Masonry is work , and that the trowel is an emblem of the Degrees in this Council. Labor, when rightly unde rstood, is both noble and ennobling, and intended to develop man's moral and spiritual nature, and not to be d eemed a disgrace or a misfortune. Everything around us is, in its bearings and infl uences, moral. The serene and bright morning, when we re cover our conscious existence from the embraces of sl eep; when, from that image of Death God calls us to a new life, and again gi ves us existence, and His mercies visit us in every bright ray and gl ad thought, and call for gratitude and content; the silence of that early dawn, the hushed silence, as it were, of expectation; the holy eventide, its cooling breeze, its lengthening shadow s, its falling shades, its still and sober hour; the su ltry noontide and the stern and solemn midnight; and Sp ring-time, and chasteni ng Autumn; and Sum- mer, that unbars our ga tes, and carries us fo rth amidst the ever- renewed wonders of th e world; and Winter , that gathers us around the evening hearth :--all these, as they pass, touch by turns the springs of the spirit ual life in us, and are conducting that life to good or evil. The idle watc h-hand often point s to something within us; and the sha dow of the gnomon on th e dial often falls upon the conscience. A life of labor is not a state of inferiorit y or degradation. The Almighty has not cast man's lo t beneath the qui et shades, and amid glad groves and lovely hills, with no task to perform; with nothing to do but to rise up and eat, and to lie down and rest. He has ordained that Work shall be done, in all t he dwellings of life, in every producti ve field, in every bu sy city, and on every wave of every ocean. And this He has done, bec ause it has plrased Him to give man a natur e destined to hi gher ends than indolent repose and irresponsible profitless indu lgence; and be- cause, for developing the energies of such a nature, work was the necessary and proper element. We might as well ask why He could not make two and two be six, as why He could not develop these energies withou t the instrumentality of work. They are equally impossibilities. This Masonry teaches, as a grea t Truth; a great moral land- mark, that ought to gu ide the course of all mankind. It teaches its toiling children that the scene of their dail y life is all spiritual, that the very implement s of their toil, the f abrics they weave, the merchandise they barter , are designed for spir itual ends; that so believing, their daily lot may be to them a sphere for the noblest improvement. That which we do in our intervals of relaxation,"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"our church-going, and our book-read ing, are especia lly designed to prepare our minds for th e action of Life. We are to hear and read and meditate, that we ma y act well; and the action of Life is itself the great field for spiritual impr ovement. There is no task of in- dustry or business, in field or fo rest, on the wharf or the ship's deck, in the office or the exchang e, but has spiritual ends. There is no care or cross of our daily labor, but was especially ordained to nurture in us patience, calmne ss, resolution, perseverance, gen- tleness, disinterestednes s, magnanimity. Nor is there any tool or implement of toil, but is a part of the great spiritual instrumen- tality. All the relations of life, those of parent, child, brother, sister, friend, associate, lover and belo ved, husband, wife, are moral, throughout every living tie and thrilling ner ve that blnd them together. They cannot subsist a day nor an hour withou t putting the mind to a trial of its truth, fidelity, for bearance, and disinter- estedness. A great city is one extended sce ne of moral action. There is blow struck in it but has a pu rpose, ultimately good or bad, and therefore moral. There is no action performed, but has a motive; and motives ar e the special jurisdiction of morality. Equipages, houses, and furniture are symbols of what is moral, and they in a thousand ways minister to right or wrong feeling. Everything that belongs to us, ministering to our comfort or lux- ury, awakens in us emotions of pr ide or gratitude, of selfishness or vanity; thoughts of self-indulgence, or me rciful remembrances of the needy and the destitute. Everything acts upon and infl uences us. God's great law of sympathy and harmony is potent and inflexible as His law of gravitation. A sentence embody ing a noble tho ught stirs our blood; a noise made by a child frets and exas perates us, and influ- ences our actions. A world of spiritual objects, infl uences, and relations lies around us all. We all vaguely deem it to be so; but he only lives a charmed life, like that of genius and poetic inspiration, who com- munes with the spiritual scene around him, hears the voice of the spirit in every sound, sees its signs in every passing form of things, and feels its impulse in all action, passion, and being. Very near to us lies the mines of wisdom; unsuspected they lie all around us. There is a secret in the simplest thin gs, a wonder in the plainest, a charm in the dullest. We are all naturally seekers of wonders. We travel far to see the majesty of old ruins, the venerable forms of the hoary moun- tains, great water-falls, and galle ries of art. A nd yet the world- wonder is all around us ; the wonder of sett ing suns, and evening stars, of the magic sp ring-time, the blossomi ng of the trees, the strange transformations of the mo th; the wonder of the Infinite Divinity and of His boundless revelation. There is no splendor beyond that which sets its mornin g throne in the go lden East; no, dome sublime as that of Heaven; no beauty so fa ir as that of the"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"verdant, blossoming earth; no pl ace, however invested with the sanctities of old time , like that home whic h is hushed and folded within the embrace of the humblest wall and roof.

In this vesture of time is wrapped the im mortal nature: in th is show of circum- stance and form stands revealed the stupendous r eality. Let man but be, as he is, a living soul, communing with hi mself and with God, and his vision becomes et ernity; his abode , infinity; his home, the bosom of all-embracing love. The great problem of Humanity is wrought out in the humblest abodes; no more than this is d one in the highest. A human heart throbs beneath the beggar's gabardine; and th at and no more stirs with its beating the Prince's m antle. The beauty of Love, the charm of Friendship, the sacred ness of Sorrow, the heroism of Patience, the noble Self-sacrifice, these and their li ke, alone, make life to be life ind eed, and are its grandeur and its power. They are the priceless trea sures and glory of hu manity; and they are not things of conditio n. All places and all scenes ar e alike clothed with the grandeu r and charm of virtues such as these. The million occasions will come to us all, in th e ordinary paths of our life, in our homes, and by our firesides, wherein we may act as nobly, as if, all our life long, we led armies, sat in senates, or visited beds of sickness a nd pain. Varying every hour, the million occasions will come in which we may restrain our pas- sions, subdue our hear ts to gentleness and patience, resign our own interst for another 's advantage, speak wo rds of kindness and wisdom, raise the fallen, cheer the fainting and sick in spirit, and soften and assuage the w eariness and bitterness of their mortal lot. To every Mason there will be opportunity enough for thes e. They cannot be written on his tomb;but they will be written deep in the hearts of men, of friends, of children, of kindred al l around him, in the book of the great account, and, in their eter nal influ- ences, on the great pages of the Universe. To such a destiny, at least, my Br ethren, let us all aspire ! These laws of Masonry let us all strive to obey! And so may our hearts become true temples of the Living God! And may He encourage our zeal, sustain our hopes, and assure us of success! XVII. KNIGHT OF THE EAST AND WEST.

In all time, trut h has been hidde n under symbols, and often under a succession of alle gories: where veil after veil had to be penetra ted before the true Light was reached, and the essential truth stood revealed. The Human Light is but an im- perfect reflection of a ray of the Infinite and Divine. We are about to appr oach those ancient Re ligions which once ruled the minds of m en, and whose ruins encumber the plains of the great Past, as the broken colu mns of Palmyra and Tadmor lie bleaching on the sands of the desert. They ri se before us, those old, strange, mysterious creeds and faiths, shrouded in the mists of antiquity, and stalk dimly an d undefined along t he line which divides Time from Eternity; and forms of strange, wild, startling beauty mingled in t he vast throngs of figur es with shapes mon- strous, grotesque, and hideous. The religion taug ht by Moses, which, li ke the laws of Egypt, enuciated the principle of exclus ion, borrowed, at every period of its existence, from all the creeds with which it came in contact. While, by the studies of the learned and wise, it enriched itself with the most admirable principles of the re ligions of Egypt and Asia, it was changed, in the wanderings of th e People, by every- thing that was most impure or seductiv e in the pagan manners and superstitions. It was one thing in the times of Moses and Aaron, another in thos e of David and Solom on, and still another in those of Dani el and Philo. At the time when John the B aptist made his appearance in the desert, near the shores of the Dead Sea, all the old philosophical and religious systems were appro ximating toward each other. A general lassitude inclined the minds of all towa rd the quietude of that amalgamation of doctrines fo r which the expeditions of Alex- ander and the more peacef ul occurrences that followed, with the establishment in Asia and Africa of many Grecian dynasties and a great number of Grec ian colonies, had pr epared the way. After the intermingling of different nations, whic h resulted from the wars of Alexander in three-quarters of the gl obe, the doctrines of Greece, of Egypt, of Persia, and of India, met a nd intermingled everywhere. All the ba rriers that had forme rly kept the nations apart, were thrown down; and wh ile the People of the West readily connected their fa ith with those of th e East, those of the Orient hastened to lear n the traditions of Rome and t he legends of Athens. While the Philosophers of Greece, all (except the dis- ciples of Epicurus) more or less Platonists, seized eargerly upon the beliefs and doctrines of the East,--the Jews and Egyptians, be- fore then the most exclusive of all peoples, yielded to that eclecti- cism which prevailed among their masters, the Gr eeks and Romans.

The people take such a creed as is offered them. Accordingly, the distinction be- tween the esoteric and t he exoteric doctrine, immemorial in other creeds, easily gained a foothold among many of the Christians; and it was held by a va st number, even durin g the preaching of Paul, that the writings of the Apostles were incomplete; that they contained only the germ s of another doctrine, which must receive from the hands of phi losophy, not only the systematic arrange- ment which was wanting, but all the development which lay con- cealed therein. The writin gs of the Apostles, t hey said, in address- ing themselves to mankind in gen eral, enunciated onl y the articles of the vulgar faith; but transmit ted the mysteries of knowledge to superior minds, to the Elect,--m ysteries handed do wn from gen- eration to generation in esoteric traditions; and to this science of the mysteries they gave the name of Gnosis. The Gnostics derived their leading doctrines and ideas from Plato and Philo, the Zend-avesta and the Kaba lah, and the Sacred books of India and Egyp t; and thus introdu ced into the bosom of Christianity the cosmologic al and theosophical speculations, which had formed the larger portion of the ancient religions of the Orient, joined to those of the Egyptian , Greek, and Jewish doctrines, which the Neo-Platonis ts had equally adopted in the Occident. Emanation from t he Deity of all spiritual beings , progressive degeneration of these be ings from emanation to emanation, re- demption and return of all to the purity of the Creator; and, after the re-establishm ent of the primitive ha rmony of all, a for- tunate and truly divine condition of all, in the bosom of God; such were the fundam ental teachings of Gn osticism. The genius of the Orient, with its contemplati ons, irradiations, and intuitions, dictated its doctrines. Its langu age corresponded to its origin. Full of imagery, it ha d all the magnificence, the inconsistencies, and the mobility of th e figurative style. Behold, it said, the light, wh ich emanates from an immense centre of Light, that spreads everywhere its benev olent rays; so do the spirits of Light emanate from the Divine Light. Behold, all the springs which nourish, embel lish, fertilize, and purify the Earth; they emanate from one and the same ocean; so from the bosom of the Divinity emanate so many streams, which form and fill the universe of intelligences. Behol d numbers, which all emanate from one primit ive number, all resemb le it, all are com- posed of its essence, and still vary infinitely ; and utterances, de- composable into so many syllables and elemen ts, all contained in the primitive Word, and still infini tely various; so the world of Intelligences emanated from a Prim ary Intelligence , and they all resemble it, and yet display an infinite variety of existences. It revived and combined the old doctrines of the Orient and the Occident; and it found in many passages of the Gospels and the"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Pastoral letters, a wa rrant for doing so. Chri st himself spoke in parables and all egories, John borrowed the enigmatical language of the Platonists, and Paul ofte n indulged in incomprehensible rhapsodies, the meaning of which could have been clear to the Initiates alone. It is admitted that the cradle of Gnosticism is probably to be looked for in Syria, and even in Palestine. Most of its expound- ers wrote in that corr upted form of the Greek used by the Hellen- istic Jews, and in t he Septuagint and the New Testament; and there is a striking analogy between their doctrines and those of the Judaeo-Egyptian Phil o, of Alexandria; itse lf the seat of three schools, at once philo sophic and religious--t he Greek, the Egyp- tian, and the Jewish. Pythagoras and Plato, the most m ystical of the Grecian Philos- ophers (the latter heir to the doctrines of the former), and who had travelled, the latter in Egypt, and the former in Phoenicia, India, and Persia, also taught the esoteric do ctrine and the distinc- tion between the init iated and the profan e. The dominant doc- trines of Platonism were fo und in Gnosticism . Emanation of Intelligences from the bosom of the Deity; the going astray in error and the sufferings of spirits, so long as they are remote from God, and imprisoned in matter; vain and long-c ontinued efforts to arrive at the know ledge of the Trut h, and re-enter into their primitive union with the Supreme Being; alliance of a pure and divine soul with an irra tional soul, the seat of evil desires; angels or demons who dwell in and gover n the planets, having but an imperfect knowledge of the ideas that pres ided at the creation; regeneration of all beings by their return to the kosmos noetos, the world of Intelligences, a nd its Chief, the Supreme Being; sole po ssible mode of re-estab lishing that primi- tive harmony of the cr eation, of which the music of the spheres of Pythagoras was the image; thes e were the analogi es of the two systems; and we discover in them some of t he ideas that form a part of Masonry; in which, in the present mutila ted condition of the symbolic Degrees, they are disg uised and overlaid with fiction and absurdity, or present themselves as casual hints that are pass- ed by wholly unnoticed. The distinction between the esoter ic and exoteric doctrines (a distinction purely Maso nic), was always and from the very earliest times preserved among the Greeks. It remounted to the fabulous times of Orpheus; and the mysteries of Theo sophy were found in all their traditions a nd myths. And after th e time of Alexander, they resorted for instruction, dogmas, and mysteries, to all the schools, to those of Egypt and Asia , as well as those of Ancient Thrace, Sicily, Et ruria, and Attica. The Jewish-Greek School of Al exandria is known only by two of its Chiefs, Aristobulus and Phil o, both Jews of Alexandria in Egypt. Belonging to Asia by its origin, to Egypt by its residence, to Greece by its langu age and studies, it strove to show that all truths embedded in the philosophies of other countries were trans-"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"planted thither from Palestine. Aristobulus declar ed that all the facts and details of the Jewish Scriptures were so many allegories, concealing the most pr ofound meanings, and th at Plato had bor- rowed from them all his finest id eas. Philo, who lived a century after him, following the same t heory, endeavored to show that the Hebrew writings, by their system of allegories, were the true source of all religious and philosophica l doctrines. According to him, the literal meaning is for the vulgar alone. Whoever has meditated on philosophy, purified himself by virtue, and raised himself by contemplation, to Go d and the intellectual world, and received their in spiration, pierces the gro ss envelope of the letter, discovers a wholly diff erent order of things, and is initiated into mysteries, of which the elementary or literal instruction offers but an imperfect image. A historical fa ct, a figure, a wo rd, a letter, a number, a rite, a custom , the parable or visi on of a prophet, veils the most profound trut hs; and he who has t he key of science will interpret all according to the light he possesses. Again we see the symbolism of Ma sonry, and the search of the Candidate for light. \"Let men of narrow minds withdraw,\" he says, \"with closed ears. We tran smit the divine mysteries to those who have received the sacred initiation , to those who prac- tise true piety and w ho are not enslaved by the empty trappings of words or the preconceiv ed opinions of the pagans.\" To Philo, the Supreme Being wa s the Primitive Light, or the Archetype of Light, Source whence the rays emanate that illumi- nate Souls. He was al so the Soul of the Universe, and as such acted in all its parts. He Himsel f fills and limits His whole Being. His Powers and Virtues fill and penetrate all. These Powers (dunameis) are Spirits distin ct from God, the \"Ideas\" of Plato personified. He is without beginnin g, and lives in the prototype of Time (aion). His image is THE WORD, a form more brilliant than fire; that not being the pure ligh t. This LOGOS dwells in God; for the Supreme Being makes to Himself with in His Intelligence the types or ideas of everything t hat is to become reality in this World. The LOGOS is the vehicle by which God acts on the Uni- verse, and may be compared to the speech of man. The LOGOS being the Worl d of Ideas, by means whereof God has create d visible things, He is the most ancient God, in comparison with the Worl d, which is the youngest pro- duction. The LOGOS, Ch ief of Intelligence, of which He is the general representative, is named Archangel, type and representa- tive of all spirits, ev en those of mortals. He is also styled the man-type and primitiv e man, Adam Kadmon. God only is Wise. The wisdom of man is but the reflection and image of that of God. He is the Father , and His WISDOM the mother of creation: fo r He united Himself wi th WISDOM (Sophia), and communicated to it the germ of creation, and it brought forth the mate rial world. He crea ted the ideal world only, and caused the material world to be made real after its type,"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"by His LOGOS, which is His speech , and at the same time the Idea of Ideas, the Intellectual World. The Intellectual City was but the Thought of the Arch itect, who meditated the creation, accord- ing to that plan of the Material City. The Word is not only the Creator, but occupies the place of the Supreme Being. Through Him all the Powers and Attributes of God act. On the other side, as first representative of the Human Family, He is the Protector of men and their Shepherd. God gives to man the Soul or Intelligence, which exists before the body, and which he unites wi th the body. The reasoning Principle comes from God throug h the Word, and communes with God and with the Word; but there is also in man an irrational Principle, that of the incli nations and passions which produce disorder, emanating from inferior spirits who fill the air as ministers of God. Th e body, taken from the Earth, and the irrational Principle that animates it concurre ntly with the rational Principle, are hated by God, wh ile the rational soul which He has given it, is, as it were, captive in this prison, this coffin, that encompasses it. The present condit ion of man is not his primi- tive condition, when he was th e image of the Logos. He has fallen from his first estate. But he may raise himself again, by following the dire ctions of WISDOM and of the Angels which God has commissi oned to aid him in freeing himself from the bonds of the body, and combating Evil, the existence whereof God has permitted, to furnish hi m the means of exercising his liberty. The souls that are purified, not by the Law but by light, rise to the Heavenly regions, to enjoy there a perfect felicity. Those that persevere in evil go fr om body to body , the seats of passions and evil desires. The fami liar lineaments of these doc- trines will be recognized by all wh o read the Epistles of St. Paul, who wrote after Philo, the latter li ving till the re ign of Caligula, and being the contempor ary of Christ. And the Mason is famili ar with these doctri nes of Philo: that the Supreme Being is a centre of Light w hose rays or emanations pervade the Universe; for that is the Light for which all Masonic journeys are a search, and of which the s un and moon in our Lodges are only emblems: that Li ght and Darkness, chief enemies from the beginning of Time, dispute with ea ch other the empire of the world; which we symboliz e by the candid ate wandering in darkness and being brou ght to light: that t he world was created, not by the Supreme Being, but by a secondary agent, who is but His WORD, and by types which are but his ideas, aided by an INTELL IGENCE, or WISDOM, which gives one of His Attributes; in which we se e the occult meaning of the ne- cessity of recovering \"the Word \"; and of our two columns of STRENGTH and WISDOM, wh ich are also the two parallel lines that bound the circle representing the Universe: that th e visible world is the image of the in visible world; that th e essence of the Human Soul is the image of God, and it existed bef ore the body; that the object of its terrestrial life is to disengage itse lf of its body or its"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"sepulchre; and that it will asce nd to the Heavenl y regions when- ever it shall be purifi ed; in which we see t he meaning, now almost forgotten in our Lodges, of the mode of prepar ation of the candi- date for apprenticeship, and his tests and purifications in the first Degree, according to the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. Philo incorporated in his ecle cticism neither Egyptian nor Oriental elements. But there were other Jewish Teachers in Alex- andria who did both . The Jews of Egypt were slightly jealous of, and a little hostile to, those of Palestine, particularly after the erection of the sanctuar y at Leontopolis by t he High-Priest Onias; and therefore they admir ed and magnified thos e sages, who, like Jeremiah, had re sided in Egypt. \"The wi sdom of Solomon\" was written at Alexandria, and, in the time of St. Jerome, was attrib- uted to Philo; but it contains principles at variance with his. It personifies Wisdom , and draws between it s children and the Profane, the same line of demarcation that Egypt had long before taught to the Jews. T hat distinction existed at the beginning of the Mosaic creed. Moshah himself was an Initiate in the mysteries of Egypt, as he was compelled to be, as the adopted son of the daughter of Pharaoh, Thouoris, daughter of Sesostris-Ramses; who, as her tomb and monuments s how, was, in the right of her infant husband, Regent of Lower Egypt or t he Delta at the time of the Hebrew Prophet 's birth, reigning at Heliopolis. She was also, as the reliefs on her tomb show, a Priestess of HATHOR and NEITH, the two great primeval goddesses. As he r adopted son, living in her Palace and presence forty year s, and during that time scarcely acquainted with his brethren t he Jews, the law of Egypt compelled his init iation: and we find in many of his enact- ments the intention of preser ving, between the common people and the Initiates, the li ne of separation which he found in Egypt. Moshah and Aharun his br other, the whole series of High-Priests, the Council of the 70 Elders, Salomoh and the entire succession of Prophets, were in possession of a higher science; and of that science Masonry is, at least, t he lineal descendant. It was famili- arly known as THE KN OWLEDGE OF THE WORD. AMUN, at first the God of Low er Egypt only, where Moshah was reared (a word that in He brew means Truth), was the Su- preme God. He was st yled \"the Celestial Lor d, who sheds Light on hidden things.\" He was the source of that divine life, of which the crux ansata is the symbol; and the source of all power. He united all the attributes that the Ancient Oriental Theosophy assigned to the Supreme Bein g. He was the Pleroma, or \"Fullness of things,\" for He comprehended in Himself every- thing; and the LIGH T; for he was the Sun-God. He was un- changeable in the midst of everyt hing phenomenal in his worlds. He created nothing; but everythi ng emanated from Him; and of Him all the other Gods we re but manifestations.

The Creative Power, another manifest ation of Deity, proc eeding to the creation conceived of in her, t he Divine Intelligence , produced with its Word the Universe, symbolized by an egg issuing from the mouth of KNEPH; from whic h egg came PHTHA, im age of the Supreme Intelligence as realized in the wo rld, and the type of that mani- fested in man; the principal agent, also, of Nature, or the creative and productive Fire. PHRE or RS, the Sun, or Celestial Light, whose symbol was the point with in a circle, was the son of PHTHA; and TIPHE, his wif e, or the celestial firmament, with the seven celestial bodies , animated by spirits of genii that govern them, was represented on many of the monuments, clad in blue or yellow, her garments sprinkled with stars, and accompanied by the sun, moon, and five planets; and she was the type of Wisdom, and they of the Seven Pl anetary Spirits of t he Gnostics, that with her presided over and go verned the sublunary world. In this Degree, unknown for a hundred years to those who have practised it, these embl ems reproduced refer to these old doctrines. The lamb, the yellow hangings st rewed with stars, the seven columns, candlesticks, and seal s all recall them to us. The Lion was the symbol of ATHOM-RE, the Great God of Upper Egypt; the Hawk, of RA or PHRE; the Eagle, of MENDES; the Bull, of APIS; and three of these are seen und er the platform on which our altar stands. The first HERMES was the INTELLIGENCE, or WORD of God. Moved with compassion for a race living without law, and wishing to teach them that th ey sprang from His bos om, and to point out to them the way that they should go (the books which the first Hermes, the same with Enoch, ha d written on the mysteries of divine science, in the sacred char acters, being unk nown to those who lived after the flood), God sent to man OSIRIS and ISIS, ac- accompanied by THOTH, the incarnat ion or terrestrial repetition of the first Hermes; who taught men the arts, science, and the cer- emonies of religion; and then ascended to Heaven or the Moon. OSIRIS was the Principle of Good. TYPHON, like AHRIMAN, was the principle and source of all that is evil in the moral and physi- cal order. Like the Satan of Gnosticism, he was confounded with Matter. From Egypt or Persia the new Platonists borr owed the idea, and the Gnostics received it from them, that man, in his terres- trial career, is successi vely under the influen ce of the Moon, of Mercury, of Venus, of the Sun, of Mars, of Jupiter, and of Saturn, until he finally reaches the Elysian Fi elds; an idea again symbolized in the Seven Seals. The Jews of Syria and Judea were the direct precursors of Gnosticism; and in thei r doctrines were ampl e oriental elements."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"These Jews had had with the Orient , at two differen t periods, inti- mate relations, familiarizing them with the doctrines of Asia, and especially of Chaldea and Persia;- -their forced resi dence in Cen- tral Asia under the Assyrians a nd Persians; and their voluntary dispersion over the w hole East, when subjects of the Seleucidae and the Romans. Living near two-thir ds of a century, and many of them long afterward, in Mesopotamia, the cradle of their race; speaking the same lang uage, and their childr en reared with those of the Chaldeans, Assyrians, Medes , and Persians, and receiving from them their name s (as the case of Da nayal, who was called Baeltasatsar, proves), they neces sarily adopted many of the doc- trines of their conquerors. T heir descendants, as Azra and Na- hamaiah show us, hardly desired to leave Persia, when they were allowed to do so. They had a sp ecial jurisdiction, and governors and judges taken from their own peopl e; many of t hem held high office, and their childr en were educat ed with those of the highest nobles. Danayal was the friend and minister of the King, and the Chief of the College of the Magi at Babylon; if we may be- lieve the book which bears his na me, and trust to the incidents related in its highly figurative and imaginative st yle. Mordecai, too, occupied a high st ation, no less than that of Prime Minister, and Esther or Astar, his cous in, was the Monarch's wife. The Magi of Babylon were expounders of figurative writings, interpreters of nature, and of dreams,--ast ronomers and divines; and from their influences arose am ong the Jews, after their rescue from captivity, a numbe r of sects, and a new exposition, the mys- tical interpretation, with all its wi ld fancies and infinite caprices. The Aions of the Gnosti cs, the Ideas of Plato, the Angels of the Jews, and the Demons of the Greeks, all correspond to the Ferouers of Zoroaster. A great number of Jewish fa milies remained permanently in their new country; and one of the most celebr ated of their schools was at Babylon. They were soon familiarized with the doctrine of Zoroaster, which itself was more ancient than Kuros. From the system of the Zend-Avesta th ey borrowed, and subsequently gave large development to, everyt hing that could be reconciled with their own faith; a nd these additions to the old doctrine were soon spread, by the constant inte rcourse of commerce, into Syria and Palestine. In the Zend-Avesta, God is Illi mitable Time. No origin can be assigned to Him: He is so enti rely enveloped in His glory, His nature and attributes are so in accessible to human Intelligence, that He can be only the object of a silent Vener ation. Creation took place by emanati on from Him. The firs t emanation was the primitive Light, and from that the King of Light, ORMUZD. By the \"WORD,\" Ormuzd created the world pure. He is its pre- server and Judge; a Being Holy and Heavenly; In telligence and Knowledge; the First-born of Time without limits ; and invested with all the Powers of the Supreme Being. Still he is, strictly speaking, the Fourth Being. He had a"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Ferouer, a pre-existing Soul (in the language of Plat o, a type or ideal); and it is said of Him, th at He existed from the beginning, in the primitive Li ght. But, that Ligh t being but an element, and His Ferouer a type, he is, in ordinary language, the First-born of ZEROUANE-AKHERENE. Behold again \"T HE WORD\" of Masonry; the Man, on the Tracing-Board of this Degree; the LIGHT toward which all Masons travel. He created after his own image, six Genii called Amshaspands, who surround his Thro ne, are his organs of communication with inferior spirits and men, transmit to Him their prayers, solicit for them His favors, and serve them as models of pur ity and perfec- tion. Thus we have t he Demiourgos of Gnos ticism, and the six Genii that assist him. These ar e the Hebrew Archangels of the Planets. The names of these Amshaspan ds are Bahman, Ardibehest, Schariver, Sapandomad, Khordad, a nd Amerdad. The fourth, the Holy SAPANDOM AD, created the first man and woman. Then ORMUZD created 28 Iseds, of whom MITHERAS is the chief. They watch, with Ormuzd and t he Amshaspands, over the happi- ness, purity, and preservation of the world, which is under their government; and they ar e also models for mankind and interpre- ters of men's prayers. With Mi thras and Ormuzd, they make a pleroma (or complete number) of 30, corres ponding to the thirty Aions of the Gnosti cs, and to the ogdoade, dodecade, and decade of the Egyptians. Mith ras was the Sun-God, invoked with, and soon confounded with him, becomi ng the object of a special wor- ship, and eclipsing Ormuzd himself. The third order of pu re spirits is more numerous. They are the Ferouers, the THOUGHTS of Ormuzd, or the IDEAS which he conceived before proceeding to th e creation of things. They too are superior to men. They protect them during their life on earth; they will purify them from evil at their resurrection. They are their tutelary genii, fr om the fall to the complete regeneration. AHRIMAN, second-born of the Primitive Light, emanated from it, pure like ORMUZD; but, proud and ambiti ous, yielded to jeal- ousy of the First-born. For his hatred and pride, the Eternal condemned him to dwell, for 12,000 years, in that part of space where no ray of light reaches; the black empire of darkness. In that period the struggle between Light and Darkness, Good and Evil will be terminated. AHRIMAN scorned to submit, and took the field against OR- MUZD. To the good spir its created by his Br other, he opposed an innumerable army of Evil Ones. To the seven Amshaspands he opposed seven Archdevs, attached to the seven Planets; to the Izeds and Ferouers an equal number of De vs, which brought upon the world all moral and ph ysical evils. H ence Poverty, Maladies, Impurity, Envy, Ch agrin, Drunkenness, Falsehood, Calumny, and their horrible array. The image of Ahriman was th e Dragon, conf ounded by the"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Jews with Satan and t he Serpent-Tempter. Af ter a reign of 3000 years, Ormuzd had created the Ma terial World, in six periods, calling successively into existence the Light, Water, Earth, plants, animals, and Man. But Ahriman co ncurred in creatmg the earth and water; for darkness was alre ady an element, and Ormuzd could not exclude its Ma ster. So also the tw o concurred in pro- ducing Man. Ormuzd produced, by his Will and Word, a Being that was the type and source of un iversal life for everything that exists under Heaven. He placed in man a pure principle, or Life, proceeding from the Supreme Be ing. But Ahriman destroyed that pure principle, in the form wherewith it was clothed; and when Ormuzd had made, of its recovered and purified essence, the first man and woman, Ahriman seduced and tempted them with wine and fruits; the wo man yielding first. Often, during the thr ee latter periods of 3000 years each, Ahri- man and Darkness are, and are to be, triumphant. But the pure souls are assisted by the Good Spirits; the Triumph of Good is decreed by the Supreme Being, and the period of that triumph will infallibly arrive. When the worl d shall be most afflicted with the evils poured out upon it by the spirits of pe rdition, three Prophets will come to bring relief to mo rtals. SOSIOSCH, the principal of the Three, will regenerate the eart h, and rest ore to it its primitive beauty, st rength, and purity. He will judge the good and the wicked. After the universal resurrection of the good, he will conduct them to a home of everlasting happiness. Ahriman, his evil demons, and all wicked men, will also be pu rified in a tor- rent of melted metal. The law of Ormuzd will reign everywhere; all men will be happy; all, enjoying unalterabl e bliss, will sing with Sosiosch the praises of the Supreme Being. These doctrines, the details of which were spar ingly borrowed by the Pharisaic Jews, were mu ch more fully adopted by the Gnostics; who taught the restorati on of all things, their return to their original pure condition, th e happiness of thos e to be saved, and their admission to the feast of Heavenly Wisdom. The doctrines of Zoroaster came originally from Bactria, an Indian Province of Persia. Natura lly, therefore, it would include Hindu or Buddhist element s, as it did. The fundamental idea of Buddhism was, matter subjugating the intelligence, and intelli- gence freeing itself from that sl avery. Perhaps something came to Gnosticism from China. \"B efore the chaos which preceded the birth of Heaven and Earth,\" says Lao-Ts eu, \"a single Being existed, immense and silent, im movable and ever active--the mother of the Universe. I know not its name: but I designate it by the word Reason. Man has his type and m odel in the Earth; Earth in Heaven; Heaven in Re ason; and Reason in Itself.\" Here again are the Ferouers, the Ideas, the Aions--the REASON or INTELLIGENCE, SI LENCE, WORD, and WISDOM of the Gnostics. The dominant system am ong the Jews after their captivity was that of the Pharosch im or Pharisees. W hether their name was"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"derived from that of the Parsees, or followers of Zoroaster, or from some other source , it is certain that they had bo rrowed much of their doctrine from the Persia ns. Like them th ey claimed to have the exclusive an d mysterious knowl edge, unknown to the mass. Like them they taught that a consta nt war was waged be- tween the Empire of Good and that of Evil. Like them they at- tributed the sin and fall of man to the de mons and their chief; and like them they admitted a specia l protection of the righteous by inferior beings, agents of Jehov ah. All their doctrines on these subjects were at botto m those of the Holy Bo oks; but singularly developed and the Orient was evidently the source from which those developments came. They styled themselves Interpre ters; a name i ndicating their claim to the exclusive possession of the true meaning of the Holy Writings, by virtue of the oral tradition which Moses had re- ceived on Mount Sinai, and whic h successive generations of Ini- tiates had transmitted, as they claimed, unaltered, unto them. Their very costume, their belief in the influences of the stars, and in the immortality an d transmigration of s ouls, their system of angels and their astronomy, were all foreign. Sadduceeism arose merely from an opposition ess entially Jewish, to these foreign teachi ngs, and that mixture of doctrines, adopted by the Pharisees, and which constituted the popular creed. We come at last to the Essenes and Ther apeuts, with whom this Degree is particularly conc erned. That in termingling of oriental and occi dental rites, of Persia n and Pythagor ean opinions, which we have pointed ou t in the doctrines of Philo, is unmistak- able in the creeds of these two sects. They were less distinguished by metaphysical speculations than by simple meditations and moral pr actices. But the latter always partook of the Zoroastri an principle, that it was necessary to free the soul from the trammels and influences of ma tter; which led to a system of abstinence and mace ration entirely opposed to the ancient Hebrai cideas, fa vorable as they were to physical pleasures. In general, the life and manners of these mystical associa- tions, as Philo and Josephus descri be them, and partic ularly their prayers at sunrise, seem the imag e of what the Zend-Avesta pre- scribes to the faithf ul adorer or Ormuzd ; and some of their observances cannot otherwise be explained. The Therapeuts resided in Egypt, in the ne ighborhood of Alex- andria; and the Esse nes in Palestine, in th e vicinity of the Dead Sea. But there was nevertheless a striking coinci dence in their ideas, readily explained by attributing it to a foreign influence. The Jews of Egypt, under the infl uence of the Sch ool of Alexan- dria, endeavored in gen eral to make their doctrines harmonize with the traditions of Greece; and thence came , in the doctrines of the Therapeuts, as stated by Philo, the many analogies between the Pythagorean and Orphi c ideas, on one side, and those of Ju- daism on the other: while the Jews of Palestine, having less com- munication with Greece , or contemning its teachings, rather im-"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"bibed the Oriental doctrines, whic h they drank in at the source and with which their re lations with Persia made them familiar. This attachment was particularl y shown in the Kabalah, which belonged rather to Pale stine than to Egypt, though extensively known in the latter; and furnished the Gnos tics with some of their most striking theories. It is a significant fact, that while Christ spoke often of the Pharisees and Sadducees, He never once mentioned the Essenes, between whose doctrines and His there was so great a resem- blance, and, in many points, so perfect an identi ty. Indeed, they are not named, nor even distinctly alluded to, anywhere in the New Testament. John, the son of a Priest who ministered in the Temple at Jerusalem, and wh ose mother was of the family of Aharun, was in the deserts until th e day of his showing unto Israel. He drank neither wine nor strong drink. Clad in hair -cloth, and with a girdle of leather, and feeding upon such food as the desert afford- ed, he preached, in t he country about Jordan, the bap tism of re- pentance, for the remission of sins; that is, the necessity of repent- ance proven by reformation. He taught the people charity and liberality; the publicans, justice, equity, and fa ir dealing; the soldiery peace, truth, and contentment ; to do violen ce to none, accuse none falsely, and be content with th eir pay. He incul- cated necessity of a vi rtuous life, and the folly of trusting to their descent from Abraham. He denounced both Pharisees and Sadducees as a generation of vipers threatened with the anger of God. He baptized those who confessed their sins. He preached in the deser t; and therefore in the country where the Essenes liv ed, professing the same doctrines. He was imprisoned befo re Christ began to pr each. Matthew men- tions him without preface or expl anation; as if, apparently, his history was too well known to need any. \"In those days,\" he says, \"came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.\" His disciples frequently fasted; for we find them with the Pharisees coming to Jesus to inquire wh y His Disciples did not fast as often as they; and He did not denounce them, as His habit was to denounce the Pharisees ; but answered them kindly and gently. From his prison, John sent two of his disci ples to inquire of Christ: \"Art thou he t hat is to come, or do we look for another ?\" Christ referred them to his mira cles as an answer; and declared to the people that Jo hn was a prophet, and mo re than a prophet, and that no grea ter man had ever been bo rn; but that the hum- blest Christian was hi s superior. He declared him to be Elias, who was to come. John had denounced to Herod his marriage wi th his brother's wife as unlawful; and fo r this he was imprison ed, and finally exe- cuted to gratify her. His disciples buried him; and Herod and others thought he ha d risen from the de ad and appeared again in the person of Christ . The people all regarded John as a prophet;"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"and Christ silenced the Priests an d Elders by asking them whether he was inspired. They f eared to excite the an ger of the people by saying that he was not. Christ declared that he came \"in the way of righteousness\"; and that the lower classes be lieved him, though the Priests and Ph arisees did not. Thus John, who was often consul ted by Herod, and to whom that monarch showed great defe rence and was often governed by his advice; whose doctrine prev ailed very extensively among the people and the pub licans, taught some cr eed older than Chris- tianity. That is plain: and it is equally plain, that the very large body of the Jews that adopted his doctrines, were neither Phari- sees nor Sadducees, but the humble, common people. They must, therefore, have been Ess enes. It is plain, too, that Christ applied for baptism as a sacred rite, well known a nd long practiced. It was becoming to him, he said, to fulfill all righteousness. In the 18th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles we read thus: \"And a certain Jew, named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an elo- quent man, and mighty in the Scri ptures, came to Ephesus. This man was instructed in the way of the Lord, and, be ing fervent in spirit, he spake and taugh t diligently the things of the Lord, know- ing only the baptism of John; and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue; whom , when Aquilla and Prisci lla had heard, they took him unto them , and expounded unto hi m the way of God more perfectly.\" Translating this from the sym bolic and figura tive language into the true ordinary sense of th e Greek text, it reads thus: \"And a certain Jew, na med Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, and of extensive learning, came to Ephesus. He had learned in the mysteries the tr ue doctrine in regard to God; and, being a zealous enthusiast, he spoke and ta ught diligently the truths in regard to the Deity, having rece ived no other bap tism than that of John.\" He knew nothing in regard to Christ ianity; for he had resided in Alexan dria, and had just t hen come to Ephesus; being, probably, a disciple of Philo, and a Therapeut. \"That, in all times,\" says St. Augustine, \"is the Christian re- ligion, which to know and follow is the most su re and certain health, called according to that name, but not a ccording to the thing itself, of which it is the name; for the thing itself, which is now called the Christian religi on, really was kn own to the An- cients, nor was wantin g at any time from the beginning of the human race, until th e time when Christ came in the flesh; from whence the true religion, which had previously existed, began to be called Christian; and this in our days is the Christian religion, not as having be en wanting in former time s, but as having, in later times, received this name.\" The disciples were first called \"Christians,\" at Antioch, wh en Barnabas and Paul began to preach there. The Wandering or Iti nerant Jews or Exorcists, who assumed to employ the Sacred Name in ex orcising evil spir its, were no doubt Therapeutae or Essenes."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"\"And it it came to pass, \" we read in the 19th chapter of the Acts, verses 1 to 4, \"that while Apol los was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper parts of Asia Minor , came to Ephesus; and finding certain disciples, he said to them, 'Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye became Be lievers ?' And they said unto him, 'We have not so much as heard that there is any Holy Ghost.' And he said to them, 'In what, then, were you baptized ?' And they said 'In John's baptis m.' Then said Paul, 'John in- deed baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in Him who was to co me after him, that is, in Jesus Christ. Wh en they heard this, t hey were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.\" This faith, taught by John, an d so nearly Chri stianity, could have been nothing but the doctrine of the Essenes; and there can be no doubt that John bel onged to that sect. The place where he preached, his macerations and fruga l diet, the doctrines he taught, all prove it conclusively. There was no other sect to which he could have belonged; ce rtainly none so numerous as his, except the Essenes. We find, from the two letters writ ten by Paul to the brethren at Corinth, that City of Luxury and Corruption, th at there were contentions among them. Rival sect s had already, about the 57th year of our era, reared their banners there, as followers, some of Paul, some of Apollos, and some of Cephas. Some of them de- nied the resurrection. Paul urged them to a dhere to the doctrines taught by himself, an d had sent Timothy to them to bring them afresh to their recollection. According to Paul, Christ was to come again. He was to put an end to all other Princi palities and Powers, and finally to Death, and then be Himself once more mer ged in God; who should then be all in all. The forms and ceremonies of the Essenes were symbolical. They had, according to Philo the Jew, four Degrees; the members being divided into two Orders, the Practici and Therapeutici; the latter being the contemplativ e and medical Brethren; and the former the active, practical, busi ness men. They were Jews by birth; and had a grea ter affection for each other than the mem- bers of any other sect . Their brotherly love was intense. They fulfilled the Christian law, \" Love one another.\" They despised riches. No one was to be found am ong them, having more than another. The possessions of one were interming led with those of the others; so that they all had but one patrimony, and were brethren. Their piet y toward God was ex traordinary. Before sunrise they never spake a word about profane matters; but put up certain prayers which they had re ceived from their forefathers. At dawn of day, and before it was light, their prayers and hymns ascended to Heaven. Th ey were eminently fa ithful and true, and the Ministers of Peace. They had mysterious ceremonies, and initiations into their mysteries; and the Candidate promised that he would ever practise fidelity to all men, and especially to those"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"in authority, \"because no one obtains the government without God's assistance.\" Whatever they said, was firmer than an oath; but they avoided swearing, and este emed it worse than perjur y. They were simple in their diet and mode of living, bore tortur e with fortitude, and despised death. They cultivated the science of medi cine and were very skillful. They d eemed it a good om en to dress in white robes. They had their own co urts, and passed right eous judgments. They kept the Sabbath more rigorously than the Jews. Their chief towns were Engad di, near the Dead Sea, and Hebron. Engaddi was abo ut 30 miles southeas t from Jerusalem, and Hebron about 20 mi les south of that city. Josephus and Eusebius speak of them as an ancient sect; and they were no doubt the first among the Jews to embrace Christ ianity: with whose faith and doctrine their ow n tenets had so many points of resemblance, and were indeed in a great me asure the same. Pliny regarded them as a ve ry ancient people. In their devotions they turned toward the rising sun; as the Jews generally did toward the Te mple. But they were no idola- ters; for they observed the law of Moses with scrupulous fidelity. They held all things in common, and despised riches, their wants being supplied by the administrat ion of Curators or Stewards. The Tetractys, composed of rou nd dots instead of jods, was re- vered among them. This being a Pythagorean sym bol, evidently shows their connection with the school of Pythago ras; but their peculiar tenets more resemble th ose of Confucius and Zoroaster; and probably were adopted while they were prisoners in Persia; which explains their turning toward the Sun in prayer. Their demeanor was s ober and chaste. They submitted to the superintendence of gover nors whom they app ointed over them- selves. The whole of their time was spent in labor, meditation, and prayer; and they were most sedulously att entive to every call of justice and humanity, and ever y moral duty. They believed in the unity of God. They supposed the s ouls of men to have fallen, by a disastrous fate, from the regions of purity and light, into the bodies which they oc cupy; during thei r continuance in which they considered them conf ined as in a prison. Therefore they did not believe in the resurr ection of the body; but in that of the soul only. They believed in a future state of rewards and punishments; and they disregarded the cerem onies or external forms enjoined in the law of Mo ses to be observed in the worship og God; holding that the words of that lawgiver were to be un- derstood in a mysterious and recondite sense, and not according to their literal meaning. They offered no sacrifices, except at home; and by meditation they endeavored, as far as possible, to isolate the soul from the body, an d carry it back to God. Eusebius broadly adm its \"that the ancient Therapeutae were Christians; and that their ancien t writings were our Gospels and Epistles.\" The ESSENES were of the Eclect ic Sect of Philosophers, and"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"held PLATo in the highest esteem; they believed that true philos- ophy, the greatest and most salutary gift of God to mortals, was scattered, in various portions, thr ough all the differe nt Sects; and that it was, consequently , the duty of every wi se man to gather it from the several quarte rs where it lay dispersed, and to employ it, thus reunited, in destroyin g the dominion of impiety and vice. The great festivals of the Solsti ces were observed in a distin- guished manner by the Essenes; as would naturally be supposed, from the fact that they reverenced the Sun, not as a god, but as a symbol of light and fi re; the fountain of wh ich, the Orientals supposed God to be. They lived in continence and abstinence, and had establislments si milar to the monaste ries of the early Christians. The writings of the Essenes were full of mysticism, parables, enigmas, and allegories. They believed in the esoteric and exote- ric meanings of the Scri ptures; and, as we ha ve already said, they had a warrant for that in the Scri ptures themselves. They found it in the Old Testament, as t he Gnostics found it in the New. The Christian writers, and even Ch rist himself, recognized it as a truth, that all Script ure had an inner and an outer meaning. Thus we find it said as follows, in one of the Gospels: \"Unto you it is give n to know the myster y of the Kingdom of God; but unto men that are wit hout, all these thin gs are done in parables; that seeing, they may see a nd not perceive , and hearing they may hear and not understand .... And th e disciples came and said unto him, 'Why speakest Thou the truth in parables ?'-- He answered and said unto them, 'Bec ause it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but to them it is not given.'\" Paul, in the 4th chapte r of his Epistle to t he Galatians, speak- ing of the simplest fa cts of the Old Testament , asserts that they are an allegory. In th e 3d chapter of the second letter to the Corinthians, he declares himself a mi nister of the New Testament, appointed by God; \"Not of the le tter, but of the spirit; for the letter killeth.\" Origen and St. Gregory held t hat the Gospels were not to be taken in their literal sens e; and Athanasius ad- monishes us that \"Shou ld we understand sacred writ according to the letter, we should fall into the most enormous blasphemies.\" Eusebius said, \"Those who pres ide over the Holy Scriptures, philosophize over them, and expoun d their literal sense by alle- gory.\" The sources of our kn owledge of the Kabalis tic doctrines, are the books of Jezirah and Sohar, the former draw n up in the second century, and the latter a little later; but cont aining materials much older than themselves. In t heir most characteristic ele- ments, they go back to the time of the exile. In them, as in the teachings of Zoroaster, everythi ng that exists emanated from a source of infinite LiGHT.

With the idea so expressed is connect ed the pantheism of India. KING OF LIGHT, THE ANCIENT, is ALL THAT IS. He is not only the real cause of all Existences; he is Infini te (AINSOPH). He is HIMSELF: there is nothing in Him that We can call Thou. In the Indian doctrine, not only is the Supreme Being the real cause of all, but he is the only r eal Existence: all the rest is illu- sion. In the Kabalah, as in the Persian and Gnostic doctrines, He is the Supreme Being unknown to all, the \"U nknown Father.\" The world is his revela tion, and subsists only in Him. His attri- butes are reproduced th ere, with different modifications, and in different degrees, so that the Universe is His Holy Splendor:it is but His Mantle; but it must be revered in silence. All beings have emanated from the Supreme Being: The nearer a being is to Him, the more perfect it is; the more remote in the scale, the less its purity. A ray of Light, shot from the Deity, is the cause and principle of all that exists. It is at once Father and Mother of All, in the sublimest sense. It penetrates ev erything; and without it nothing can exist an instant. From this double FORCE, desi gnated by the two parts of the word I.ù. H.ù. U.ù. H.ù. em anated the FIRST-BORN of God, the Universa l Form, in which are contained all beings; the Persian and Platonic Archet ype of things, united with the Infinite by the prim itive ray of Light. This First-Born is the Creati ve Agent, Conservator, and ani- mating Principle of the Universe. It is THE LIGHT OF LIGHT. It possesses the three Prim itive Forces of th e Divinity, LIGHT, SPIRIT and LIFE. As it has received what it gives, Light and Life, it is equally co nsidered as the gen- erative and conceptive Principl e, the Primitive Man, ADAM KADMON. As such, it has revealed itself in ten emanations or Sephiroth, which are not ten different beings, nor even beings at all; but sources of life, vessels of Omnipotence, an d types of Cre- ation. They are Sovereignty or Will, Wisdom, Intelligence, Benignity, Severity, Beauty, Vict ory, Glory, Permanency, and Empire. These are attributes of God; and this idea, that God re- veals Himself by His attributes, and that the hu man mind cannot perceive or discern God Himself, in his wor ks, but only his mode of manifesting Himself, is a pr ofound Truth. We know of the Invisible only what th e Visible reveals. Wisdom was called NOUS and LOGOS, lN- TELLECT or the WORD. Intelligence, source of the oil of anoint- ing, responds to the Holy G host of the Christian Faith. Beauty is represented by green and yellow. Victory is YA- HOVAH-TSABAOTH, the column on the right hand, the column Jachin: Glory is the column Bo az, on the left ha nd. And thus our symbols appear again in the Kabalah. A nd again the LIGHT, the object of our labo rs, appears as the creati ve power of Deity. The circle, also, was the specia l symbol of the first Sephirah, Kether, or the Crown."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"We do not further follow the K abalah in its four Worlds of Spirits, Aziluth, Briah, Yezirah, and Asiah, or of emanation, crea- tion, formation, and fabrication, one inferior to and one emerging from the other, the s uperior always enveloping the inferior;its doctrine that, in all that exists, there is nothing purely material; that all comes from G od, and in all He proc eeds by irradiation; that everything subsists by th e Divine ray that penetrates crea- tion; and all is united by the Spirit of God, which is the life of life; so that all is God; the Existences th at inhabit the four worlds, inferior to each other in proportion to thei r distance from the Great King of Light: the co ntest between the good and evil Angels and Principles, to endure until the Eternal Himself comes to end it and re-estab lish the primitive harmo ny; the four distinct parts of the Soul of Man; and the migrati ons of impure souls, until they are suffici ently purified to share with the Spirits of Light the contemplati on of the Supreme Be ing whose Splendor fills the Universe. The WORD was also found in the Phoenician Cre ed. As in all those of Asia, a WORD of God, writ ten in starry characters, by the planetary Divinities, and communica ted by the Demi-Gods, as a profound mystery, to the higher classes of the hum an race, to be communicated by them to mankind, created the world. The faith of the Phoenicians wa s an emanation from that ancient worship of the Stars, which in the creed of Zo roaster alone, is connected with a faith in one God. Li ght and Fire are the most important agents in the Phoenician faith. There is a race of children of the Light. They adored the Heaven with its Lights, deeming it the Supreme God. Everything emanates from a Single Principl e, and a Primitive Love, which is the Moving Power of All and gove rns all. Light, by its union with Spir it, whereof it is but the vehicle or symbol, is the Life of everything, and penetrates everyt hing. It should therefore be respect ed and honored everywher e; for everywhere it governs and controls. The Chaldaic and Jerusalem Pa raphrasts endeavor ed to render the phrase, DEBAR-YAHOVAH, the Word of God, a personalty, wherever they met with it. The phrase, \"And God created man,\" is, in the Jerusa lem Targum, \"And the Word of IHUH created man.\" So, in xxviii. Gen. 20,21, where Jacob says: \"If God (IHIH ALHIM) will be with me... then shall IHUH be my ALHIM; UHIH IHUH LI LALH IM; and this stone shall be God's House (IHIH BITH ALHIM): Onkelos paraphrases it, \"If the wo rd of IHUH will be my help . . . . then the word of IHUH s hall be my God.\" So, in iii. Gen. 8, for \"The Voice of the Lord God\" (IHUH ALHIM), we have, \"The Vo ice of the Word of IHUH.\" In ix. Wisdom, 1, \"O God of my Fathers and Lo rd of Mercy! who has made all thin gs with thy word.\" And in xviii. Wisdom, 15, \"T hine Almighty Word leap-"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"ed down from Heaven.\" Philo speaks of the Word as bei ng the same with God. So in several places he calls it the Second Di- vinity; the Image of God: the Divine Word that made all things: substitu te, of God; and the like. Thus when John commenced to preach, had been for ages agitated, by the Priests and Phil osophers of the East and West, the great questions concerning the et ernity or crea tion of matter: immediate or intermediate creati on of the Universe by the Su- preme God; the origin, object, and final exti nction of evil; the relations between the intellectual and mate rial worlds, and be- tween God and man; and the creation, fa ll, redemption, and restoration to his first estate, of man. The Jewish doctrine, differing in th is from all the other Oriental creeds, and even from the Alohayistic legend with which the book of Genesis commences, attributed the creation to t he immediate action of the Suprem e Being. The Theoso phists of the other Eastern Peoples interposed more than one intermediary between God and the world. To place be tween them but a single Being, to suppose for the production of the world but a single inter- mediary, was, in their eyes, to lower the Suprem e Majesty. The interval between God, w ho is perfect Purity, and matter, which is base and foul, was too great for them to cl ear it at a single step. Even in the Occident , neither Plato nor Ph ilo could thus im- poverish the Intellectual World. Thus, Cerinthus of Ephesus, with most of the Gn ostics, Philo, the Kabalah, the Zend-Avesta, t he Puranas, and all the Orient, deemed the distance a nd antipathy between the Supreme Being and the material world too great, to attribute to the former the creation of the latter. Below, and emanating from, or created by, the Ancient of Days, the Ce ntral Light, the Beginning, or First Principle, one, two, or more Principles, Existences, or Intellectual Beings were im agined, to some one or more of whom (without any immediate cr eative act on the part of the Great Immovable, Sile nt Deity), the immedi ate creation of the material and mental universe was due. We have already spok en of many of the sp eculations on this point. To some, the world was cr eated by the LO GOS or WORD, first manifestation of, or emanation from, t he Deity. To others, the beginning of creation was by the emanation of a ray of Light, creating the pr inciple of Light and Life. The Primitive THOUGHT, creating the inferior De ities, a successi on of INTELL- GENCES, the Iynges of Zoroaste r, his Amshaspands, Izeds, and Ferouers, the Ideas of Plato, the Aions of the Gnostics, the Angels of the Jews, the Nous, the Demiourg os, the DIVINE REA- SON, the Powers or Forces of Ph ilo, and the Alohayim, Forces or Superior Gods of t he ancient legend with which Genesis begins,- to these and other in termediaries the creati on was owing. No re- straints were laid on the Fancy and the Imagination. The veriest Abstractions became Existences a nd Realities. The attributes of"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"God, personified, became Powers , Spirits, Intelligences. God was the Light of Light, Divine Fire, the Abstract Intellec- tuality, the Root or Germ of the Universe. Simon Magus, founder of the Gnostic faith, and many of the early Judaizi ng Christians, admitted that th e manifestations of t he Supreme Being, as FATHER, or JEhOVAh , SON or CHRIST, and HOLY SPIRIT, were only so many different modes of Ex istence, or Forces of the same God. To others they were, as were th e multitude of Sub- ordinate Intelligences, r eal and distinct beings. The Oriental imaginatio n revelled in the cr eation of these In- ferior Intelligences, Powers of Good and Evil, and Angels. We have spoken of those imagined by the Persians and the Kabalists. In the Talmud, every star, every country, every town, and almost every tongue has a Prince of Heav en as its Protector. JEHUEL, is the guardian of fire, and MICHAEL of water. Seven spirits assist each; those of fire being Seraph iel, Gabriel, Nitriel, Tammael, Tchimschiel, Hadarniel, and Sarn iel. These seven are represented by the square columns of this Degree, while th e columns JACHIN and BOAZ represent the angels of fire and wa ter. But the col- umns are not representat ives of these alone. To Basilides, God was without name, uncreated, at first contain- ing and concealing in Himself the Plenitude of His Perfections; and when these are by Hi m displayed and nianif ested, there result as many particular Existences, al l analogous to Hi m, and still and always Him. To the Essenes and t he Gnostics, the East and the West both devised this faith; t hat the Ideas, Conceptions, or Manifestations of the Deity were so many Creations, so many Be- ings, all God, nothing without Hi m, but more than what we now understand by the word ideas. They emanated from and were again merged in God. They had a kind of middle existence be- tween our modern ideas, and the intelli gences or ideas, elevated to the rank of genii, of the Oriental mythology. These personified attribut es of Deity, in the theory of Basilides, were the First-born, Nous or Mind: from it emanates Logos, or THE WORD from it : Phronesis, Intellect :from it Sophia, Wisdom :from it Dunamis, Power: and from it Dikaiosune, Righteousness: to which latter the Jews gave the name of Eirene, Peace, or Calm , the essential characte ristics of Divinity, and harmonious effect of all His perfections. The whole number of successive emanations was 365, expressed by the Gnostics, in Greek letters, by the myst ic word Abraxas; desig- nating God as manifest ed, or the aggrega te of his m anifestations; but not the Supreme and Secret God Himsel f. These three hun- dred and sixty-five Intelligences compose altogeth er the Fullness or Plenitude of the Divine Emanations. With the Ophites, a sect of the Gnostics, there were seven infe- rior spirits (inferior to Ialdabaoth , the Demiourgos or Actual Cre- ator : Michael, Suri el, Raphael, Gabriel, Thauthabaoth, Erataoth, and Athaniel, the genii of the stars called the Bull; the Dog, the"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Lion, the Bear, the Serp ent, the Eagle, and the Ass th at formerly figured in the constellation Canc er, and symbolized respectively by those animals; as Ialdabaoth, Iao, Ado nai, Eloi, Orai, and As- taphai were the genii of Saturn, the M oon, the Sun, Jupiter, Venus, and Mercury. The WORD appears in al l these creeds. It is the Ormuzd of Zoroaster, the Ainsoph of the Kabalah, the Nous of Platonism and Philonism, and the S ophia or Demiourgos of the Gnostics. And all these creeds, while admitti ng these different manifesta- tions of the Supreme Be ing, held that His id entity was immutable and permanent. That was Plato's distinction between the Being always the same and the perpet ual flow of things inces- santly changing, the Genesis. The belief in dualism in some shape, was universal. Those who held that everyt hing emanated from God, aspired to God, and re-entered into God, believed that, among those emanations were two adverse Principles, of Ligh t and Darkness, Good and Evil. This prevailed in Central Asia and in Syria; while in Egypt it assumed the form of Greek speculat ion. In the former, a second Intellectual Principle was admitted, active in its Empire of Dark- ness, audacious against the Empire of Light. So the Persians and Sabeans understood it. In Egypt, this second Principle was Mat- ter, as the word was used by th e Platonic School, with its sad at- tributes, Vacuity, Dark ness, and Death. In their theory, matter could be animated only by the lo w communication of a principle of divine life. It resi sts the influences that would spiritualize it. That resisting Power is Satan, the rebellious Matter, Matter that does not partake of God. To many there were two Princi ples; the Unknow n Father, or Supreme and Eternal Go d, living in the ce ntre of the Light, happy in the perfect purity of His being; the other, eternal Mat- ter, that inert, shap eless, darksome mass, wh ich they considered as the source of all evils, the mo ther and dwelling-pl ace of Satan. To Philo and the Platonists, there was a Soul of th e world, cre- ating visible things, and active in them, as agent of the Supreme Intelligence; realizing therein th e ideas communica ted to Him by that Intelligence, and which some times excel His conceptions, but which He executes wit hout comprehending them. The Apocalypse or Revelations, by whomever wr itten, belongs to the Orient and to extreme antiq uity. It reproduces what is far older than itself. It pain ts, with the strongest co lors that the Ori- ental genius ever employed, the cl osing scenes of t he great strug- gle of Light, a nd Truth, and Good , against Darkness, Error, and Evil; personified in that between the New Religion on one side, and Paganism and Ju daism on the other. It is a particular appli- cation of the anci ent myth of Ormuzd a nd his Genii against Ahri- man and his Devs; and it celebrates the fi nal triumph of Truth against the combined powers of men and demons. The ideas and imagery are borrowed from every quarter; and allusions are found in it to the doctrines of all ag es.

The Seven Spirits surrounding the Th rone of the Et ernal, at the opening of the Grand Drama, an d acting so impor tant a part throughout, everywhere the first in struments of t he Divine Will and Vengence, are the Se ven Amshaspands of Parsism; as the Twenty-four Ancients, offering to the Supr eme Being the first supplications and the first homage, remind us of the Mysterious Chiefs of Judaism, fo reshadow the Eons of Gnosticism, and re- produce the twenty-four Good Spir its created by Ormuzd and in- closed in an egg. The Christ of the Apocalypse, First-born of Creation and of the Resurrection is invested with the characteristics of the Ormuzd and Sosiosch of the Z end-Avesta, the Ains oph of the Kabalah and the Carpistes of the G nostics. The idea that the true Initiates and Faithful become Kings an d Priests, is at once Persian, Jewish, Christian, and Gnostic. And the definition of the Supreme Being, t hat He is at once Alpha and Omega, the be- ginning and the end--H e that was, and is , and is to come, i.e., Time illimitable, is Zor oaster's definition of Zerouane-Ak- herene. The depths of Satan which no m an can measure; his triumph for a time by fraud and violence; his being chai ned by an angel; his reprobation a nd his precipitation into a sea of metal; his names of the Serpent and the Dragon; the whole conflict of the Good Spirits or cele stial armies against the bad; are so many ideas and designations found alike in the Zend-Avesta, the Ka- balah, and the Gnosis. We even find in the Apocalypse that singular Persian idea, which regards some of the lower animals as so many Devs or ve- hicles of Devs. The guardianship of t he earth by a good ang el, the renewing of the earth and heavens, and the final triumph of pure and holy men, are the same vict ory of Good over Evil , for which the whole Orient looked. The gold, and white ra iments of the twenty- four Elders are, as in the Persian faith, the signs of a lofty perfect ion and divine purity. Thus the Human mind labored and str uggled and tortured itself for ages, to explain to itself what it felt, without co nfessing it, to be inexplicable. A vast crowd of i ndistinct abstractions, hovering in the imagination, a tr ain of words embodying no tangible mean- ing, an inextricable labyrinth of subtleties, was the result. But one grand idea ever emerge d and stood prominent and un- changeable over the weltering chaos of conf usion. God is great, and good, and wise. Evil and pain and sorrow are temporary, and for wise and benefic ent purposes. They must be consistent with God's goodness, purit y, and infinite pe rfection; and there must be a mode of explaining th em, if we could but find it out; as, in all ways we will endeavor to do.

Behold the object, the end, the result, of th e great speculations and logomachies of anti quity; the ultimate an nihilation of evil, and restoration of Man to his first estate, by a Redeemer, a Ma- sayah, a Christos, the incarnate Wo rd, Reason, or Power of Deity. This Redeemer is the Word or Lo gos, the Ormuzd of Zoroaster, the Ainsoph of the Ka balah, the Nous of Pl atonism and Philon- ism; He that was in the Beginn ing with God, and was God, and by Whom everything was made. That He was looked for by all the People of the East is abundantly shown by the Gospel of John and the Letters of Paul ; wherein scarcely anyt hing seemed neces- sary to be said in proof that such a Rede emer was to come;but all the energies of the writers are devoted to showing that Jesus was that Christos whom all t he nations were expecting; the \"Word,\" the Masayah, the Anointed or Consecrated One. In this Degree the great contest between good and ev il, in antici- pation of the appearance and advent of the Word or Redeemer is symbolized; and th e mysterious esoteric t eachings of the Essenes and the Cabalists. Of the practices of the former we gain but glimpses in the ancient writers; but we know that, as their doc- trines were taught by John the Baptist, they greatly resembled those of greater purity and more nearly perfect, taught by Jesus; and that not only Pale stine was full of John's disciples, so that the Priests and Pharisees did not dare to deny John 's inspiration; but his doctrine had extended to Asia Minor, and had made converts in luxurious Ephesus, as it also had in Alexandria in Egypt; and that they readily embraced the Ch ristian faith, of which they had before not even heard. These old controversies have died away, and the ol d faiths have faded into oblivion. But Masonr y still survives, vigorous and strong, as when philosophy was taught in the schools of Alexan- dria and under the Port ico; teaching the same old truths as the Essenes taught by the shores of the Dead Sea, and as John the Baptist preached in the Desert; truths imperis hable as the Deity, and undeniable as Light. Those truths were gathered by the Essenes from the doctrines of the Orient and the Occident, from the Zend-Avesta and t he Vedas, from Plato and Pythagoras, from India, Persia, Phoeni cia, and Syria, from Greece and Egypt, and from the Holy Books of the Jews. Hence we are called Knights of the East and West, because th eir doctrines came from both. And these doctrines, the wheat si fted from the chaff, the Truth seperated from Error, Masonry has garnered up in her heart of hearts, and through the fi res of persecution, and the storms of calamity, has brought them and delivered them unto us. That God is One, immutable, unchangea ble, infinitely just and good; that Light will finally overco me Darkness,--Good conquer Evil, and Truth be victor over Error ;--these, reject ing all the wild and useless speculations of the Zend-Avesta, the Kabalah, the Gnostics, and the Schools, are t he religion and Phil osophy of Masonry."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Those speculations and fancies it is useful to st udy; that know- ing in what worthless and unfrui tful investigati ons the mind may engage, you may the more value and appreciate the plain, simple, sublime, universally- acknowledged truths, wh ich have in all ages been the Light by which Masons have been guided on their way; the Wisdom and Strength that like imperishable columns have sustained and will conti nue to sustain its glor ious and magnificent Temple.

With these special interp retations we have here nothing to do. Like the legend of the Master Khur um, in which some see figured the condemnat ion and sufferings of Christ; others those of the unfortunate Grand Master of the Templars; others those of the first C harles, King of England; and ot hers still the annual descent of the S un at the winter Solsti ce to the regions of darkness, the basis of many an an cient legend; so the ceremonies of this Degree receive different explanations; eac h interpreting them for himself, and being offende d at the interpretation of no other. In no other way could Masonry po ssess its character of Univer- sality; that character which has ev er been peculiar to it from its origin; and which enables two Ki ngs, worshippers of different Deities, to sit together as Masters, while the walls of the first tem- ple arose; and the men of Gebal, bowing down to the Phoenician Gods, to work by the side of the Hebrews to wh om those Gods were abomination; and to sit with them in the same Lodge as brethren. You have already l earned that these cere monies have one gen- eral significance, to ev ery one, of every faith, who believes in God, and the soul's immortality. The primitive men met in no Temple s made with hu man hands. \"God,\" said Sthe existenc e of a single uncreated God, in whose bosom everything grows, is developed and trans- formed.

The belief was general, that He was to be born of a Virgin, and suffer a painful death. The In dians called him Chrishna; the Chinese, Kioun-tse;the Persians, Sosiosch; the Chaldeans, Dhou- vanai; the Egyptians, Har-Oeri; Plato, Love; and the Scandina- vians, Balder. Chrishna,the Hindoo Redeemer, was cradl ed and educated among Shepherds. A Tyrant, at t he time of his birth, ordered all male children to be slain. He perfor med miracles, say his legends, even raising th e dead. He washed the feet of the Brah- mins, and was meek and lowly of spirit. He was born of a Vir- gin; descended to Hell, rose agai n, ascended to Heaven, charged his disciples to teach his doctrines, and gave t hem the gift of mir- acles. The first Masonic Legi slator whose memory is preserved to us by history, was Buddh a, who, about a thou sand years before the Christian era, reform ed the religion of Mano us. He called to the Priesthood all men, witho ut distinction of ca ste, who felt them- selves inspired by God to instru ct men. Those who so associated themselves formed a Society of Prophets under th e name of Sa- maneans. They recognized the ex istence of a single uncreated God, in whose bosom everything grows, is developed and trans- formed. The worship of this God reposed upon the obedience of all the beings He created . His feasts were thos e of the Solstices. The doctrines of Budd ha pervaded India, Chi na, and Japan.

The Phoenician Cosmogon y, like all others in Asia, was the Word of God, written in astral characters, by the planetary Divin- ities, and communicated by the Demi-gods, as a pr ofound mystery, to the brighter inte lligences of Humanity , to be propagated by them among men. Their doctrines resembled the Ancient Sabe- ism, and being the fa ith of Hiram the King and his namesake the Artist, are of interest to all Masons. With them, the First Prin- ciple was half material, half spirit ual, a dark ai r, animated and impregnated by the sp irit; and a disordered chaos, covered with"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"thick darkness. From this came the Word, and thence creation and generation; and thence a race of men, children of light, who adored Heaven and its Stars as th e Supreme Being; and whose different gods were but incarnatio ns of the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, and the Ether. Chrysor was the great igneous power of Nature, and Baal and Malakarth representatio ns of the Sun and Moon, the latter word, in Hebrew, meaning Queen. Man had fallen, but not by the tempting of the serpent. For, with the Phoenicians, the serpent was deemed to partak e of the Divine Nature, and was sacred, as he was in Egypt. He was deemed to be immortal, unless slai n by violence, becoming young again in his old age, by entering into and consuming himself. Hence the Serpent in a circle, holding his tail in his mouth, was an emblem of eternity. With t he head of a hawk he was of a Divine Nature, and a symbol of the sun. Hence one Sect of the Gnostics took him for their good genius , and hence the brazen ser- pent reared by Moses in the Desert, on which the Israelites looked and lived. \"Before the chaos, that prec eded the birth of Heaven and Earth,\" said the Chinese Lao-Tseu, \"a single Being existed, im- mense and silent, immutable and al ways acting;the mother of the Universe. I know not the name of that Being, but I designate it by the word Reason. Man ha s his model in the earth, the earth in Heaven, Heav en in Reason, and Reason in itself.\" \"I am,\" says Isis, \"Nature;paren t of all things, the sovereign of the Elements, the primitive pr ogeny of Time, the most exalted of the Deities, the fi rst of the Heavenly Gods and Goddesses, the Queen of the Shades, the uniform counten ance; who dispose with my rod the numerous lights of Heaven, t he salubrious breezes of the sea, and the mo urnful silence of t he dead; whose single Divinity the whole worl d venerates in many forms, with various rites and by many name s. The Egyptians, skill ed in ancient lore, worship me with proper ceremonies, and call me by my true name, Isis the Queen.\" The Hindu Vedas thus define the Deity: \"He who surpasses speech, and through whose power speech is expressed, know thou that He is Brahma; and not these perish- able things that man adores. \"He whom Intelligence cannot co mprehend, and He alone, say the sages, through whose Power th e nature of Intelligence can be understood, know t hou that He is Brahma; and not these perish- able things that man adores. \"He who cannot be seen by the organ of sight , and through whose power the organ of seeing sees, know thou that He is Brahma; and not these perishabl e things that man adores. \"He who cannot be heard by the organ of he aring, and through whose power the organ of hearing hears, know thou that He is Brahma; and not these perishabl e things that man adores. \"He who cannot be perceived by the organ of smelling, and through whose power the organ of smelling sm ells, know thou that"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"He is Brahma; and not these perishable things that man adores.\" \"When God resolved to create the human race,\" said Arius, \"He made a Being that He called The WORD , The Son, Wisdom, to the end that this Being might give exis tence to men.\" This WORD is the Ormuzd of Zoroas ter, the Ainsoph of the Kabalah, the Nous of Plato and Philo, the Wisdom or Demiourgos of the Gnostics. That is the True Word, the k nowledge of which our ancient brethren sought as t he priceless reward of their labors on the Holy Temple: the Word of Life , the Divine Reas on, \"in whom was Life, and that Life the Light of men\";\" which long shone in darkness, and the darkness comp rehended it not;\" the Infinite Reason that is the Soul of Natu re, immortal, of which the Word of this Degree reminds us; and to believe wherein a nd revere it, is the peculiar duty of every Mason. \"In the beginning,\" says the extr act from some older work, with which John commences his Gospel, \"was the Word, and the Word was near to God, and the Word was God. All things were made by Him, and wi thout Him was not any thing made that was made. In Him was Life, and the li fe was the Light of man; and the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness did not contain it.\" It is an old tradition that this passage was from an older work. And Philostorgius and Nicephorus state, th at when the Emperor Julian undertook to rebuild the Temple, a stone was taken up, that covered the mouth of a deep square cave, into which one of the laborers, being let down by a rope, found in the centre of the floor a cubical pill ar, on which lay a roll or book, wrapped in a fine linen cloth, in which, in capital letters, was the foregoing passage. However this may have been, it is plain that John's Gospel is a polemic against the Gnos tics; and, stating at the outset the current doctrine in regard to the creation by the Word, he then addresses himself to show and urge that this Word was Jesus Christ. And the first sentence, fully r endered into our language, would read thus:\"When the process of em anation, of creation or evolu- tion of existences inferior to the Supreme God began, the Word came into existence and was: and this word was near to God; i.e. the immediate or first emanati on from God:and it was God Himself, developed or manifested in that particular mode, and in action. And by that Word everything that is was created.\"-And thus Tertullian sa ys that God m ade the World out of nothing, by means of Hi s Word, Wisdom, or Power. To Philo the Jew, as to the Gnostics, the Supreme Being was the Primitive Light, or Archet ype of Light,-Source whence the rays emanate that illumi nate Souls. He is t he Soul of the World, and as such acts everywhere. He himself fills and bounds his whole existence, and his forces fi ll and penetrate everything. His Image is the WORD [LOGOS ], a form more brilli ant than fire, which is not pure light.

The WORD is the Vehicle by whic h God acts on the Universe; the World of Ideas by means whereof God has created visible things; the more Ancient God, as comp ared with the Material World; Chief and General Representative of all Intelligen ces; the Arch- angel and representative of all spirits, even those of Mortals; the type of Man; the primitive man himsel f. These ideas are borrowed from Plato. An d this Word is not only the Creator [\"by Him was everything made that wa s made\"], but acts in the place of God and through him act all t he Powers and At tributes of God. And also, as first represen tative of the hum an race, he is the protector of Men and their Shepher d, the \"Ben H'Adam,\" or Son of Man. The actual condition of Man is not his prim itive condition, that in which he was the image of the Word. His un ruly passions have caused him to fall from his or iginal lofty estate. But he may rise again, by follow ing the teachings of Heavenly Wisdom, and the Angels whom God commissions to aid him in escaping from the entanglements of the body; and by fighting bravely against Evil, the existence of which God has allowed solely to furnish him with the means of exer cising his free will. The Supreme Being of the Egyp tians was Amun, a secret and concealed God, the Unknown Father of the Gnostics, the Source of Divine Life, and of all force, the Plenitude of all, comprehend- ing all things in Himself, the or iginal Light. He creates nothing; but everything emanates from Him : and all other Gods are but his manifestations. From Him, by the utterance of a Word, ema- nated Neith, the Divine Mother of all things, the Primitive THOUGHT, the FORCE that puts everything in movement, the SPIRIT everywhere exte nded, the Deity of Light and Mother of the Sun. Of this Supreme Being, Osiris was the image, Source of all Good in the moral and physical world, and cons tant foe of Typhon, the Genius of Evil, the Satan of Gn osticism, brute mat- ter, deemed to be al ways at feud with the spirit that flowed from the Deity; and over whom Har-Oe ri, the Redeemer, Son of Isis and Osiris, is finally to prevail. In the Zend-Avesta of the Pe rsians the Supr eme Being is Time without limit, ZERUANE AK HERENE.--No origin could be assigned to Him; for He was env eloped in His own Glory, and His Nature and Attributes were so inaccessible to human Intelli- gence, that He was but the object of a silent veneration. The com- mencement of Creation was by em anation from Him. The first emanation was the Prim itive Light, and from this Light emerged Ormuzd, the King o[ Light, who, by the WORD, created the World in its purity, is its Preserver and Judge, a Holy and Sacred Be- ing, Intelligence and Knowledge, Himself Ti me withou t limit, and wielding all t he powers of the Supreme Being. In this Persian faith, as taught many cent uries before our era, and embodied in the Zend-Avesta, t here was in man a pure Prin-"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"ciple, proceeding from the Supreme Being, produced by the Will and Word of Ormuzd. To that was united an impure principle, proceeding from a foreign influence, that of Ahriman, the Dragon, or principle of Evil. Tempted by Ahriman, the first man and woman had fallen; and for twelve thousand years t here was to be war between Ormuzd and the Good Spirits created by him, and Ahrirnan and the Evil ones whom he had ca lled into existence. But pure souls are assi sted by the Good Spir its, the Triumph of the Good Principle is determined upon in the decr ees of the Su- preme Being, and the period of that triumph will infallibly arrive. At the moment wh en the earth shall be mo st afflicted with the evils brought upon it by the Spirits of pe rdition, three Prophets will appear to bring assi stance to mortals. Sosiosch, Chief of the Three, will regenerate the world, and restore to it its primitive Beauty, Strength, and Purity. He will judge th e good and the wicked. After the universal resu rrection of the Good, the pure Spirits will conduct them to an abode of eternal happiness. Ahri- man, his evil Demons, an d all the world, will be purified in a tor- rent of liquid burni ng metal. The Law of Ormuzd will rule everywhere: all men will be happy: all, enjoying an unalterable bliss, will unite with Sosiosch in singing the pr aises of the Su- preme Being. These doctrines, with some modifications, were adopted by the Kabalists and afterwar d by the Gnostics. Apollonius of Tyana says:\"We shall rende r the most appropri- ate worship to the Deity, when to that God whom we call the First, who is One, and separate from all, and after whom we recog- nize the others, we present no offerings whatever, kindle to Him no fire, dedicate to Hi m no sensible thing; for he needs nothing, even of all that natures more ex alted than ours could give. The earth produces no plant, the air nourishes no animal, there is in short nothing, which w ould not be impure in his sight. In ad- dressing ourselves to Him, we mu st use only the hi gher word, that, I mean, which is not expressed by the mouth,--the silent inner word of the spirit ... .. From the most Glori ous of all Beings, we must seek for blessings, by that which is most glorious in our- selves; and that is the spir it, which needs no organ.\" Strabo says: \"This one Supreme E ssence is that which embraces us all, the water and the land, that which we call the Heavens, the World, the Nature of things. This Hi ghest Being should be worshipped, without any visible image, in sacred grov es. In such retreats the devout should lay th emselves down to sleep, and expect signs from God in dreams.\" Aristolte says:\"It has been hande d down in a mythical form, from the earliest times to posterity, that th ere are Gods, and that The Divine compasses entire nature. All besi des this has been added, after the mythical style, for the purpos e of persuading the multitude, and fo r the interest of the la ws and the advantage of the State.

But if, from all this, we separate the original prin ciple, and con- sider it alone, namely, that the first Essenc es are Gods, we shall find that this has been divinely sa id; and since it is probable that philosophy and the arts have been seve ral times, so far as that is possible, found and lost, such do ctrines may have been preserved to our times as the rema ins of ancient wisdom.\" Porphyry says: \"By images addr essed to sense, the ancients represented God and his powers--by the visible th ey typified the invisible for those who had learned to read, in these types, as in a book, a treatise on the Gods. We need not wonder if the igno- rant consider the images to be nothing more than wood or stone; for just so, they who are ignorant of writing see nothi ng in monu- ments but stone, nothi ng in tablets but wood, and in bo oks but a tissue of papyrus.\" Apollonius of Tyana held, that birth and de ath are only in ap- pearance; that which separates itse lf from the one substance (the one Divine essence), and is caught up by matter, seems to be born; that, again, which releases itself from the bonds of matter, and is reunited with the one Divine Essence, seems to die. There is, at most, an alteration between becoming visibl e and becoming in- visible. In all there is, properly speaking, but t he one essence, which alone acts and su ffers, by becoming all things to all;the Eternal God, whom m en wrong, when they deprive Him of what properly can be attrib uted to Him only, and transfer it to other names and persons. The New Platonists substituted the idea of the Absolute, for the Supreme Essence itself;--as the first, simplest principle, ante- rior to all existence; of whic h nothing determinat e can be predi- cated; to which no consciousness, no self-contem plation can be ascribed; inasmuch as to do so, would immediately imply a qual- ity, a distinction of subject and object. This Supreme Entity can be known only by an inte llectual intuition of the Spirit, trans- scending itself, and emancipating it self from its own limits. This mere logical t endency, by means of which men thought to arrive at the concepti on of such an absolute , the ov, was united with a certain mysticism, which, by a transcendent state of feel- ing, communicated, as it were, to this abstraction what the mind would receive as a real ity. The absorption of the Spirit into that superexistence, so as to be entirely identified with it, or such a revela tion of the latter to the spirit raised above itself, was regarded as the highest end which the spiritual life could reach. The New Platonists' idea of God, was that of One Simple Origi- nal Essence, exalted akes a distin ction between those who are in the proper sense Sons of God, having by m eans of contemplation raised themselves to the highest Be ing, or attained to a knowledge of Him, in His immediate self-m anifestation, and those who know God only in his mediat e revelation through hi s operation--such as He declares Himself in creation--in the revelation st ill veiled in"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"the letter of Scripture--those, in short, who atta ch themselves simply to the Logos, and consider this to be the Supreme God; who aren; and after it has rid itself from all that pe rtains to sense-from al l manifoldness.

Philo says:\"He who disbelieves t he miraculous, si mply as the miraculous, neither know s God, nor has he ever sought after Him; for otherwise he would have understood, by l ooking at that truly great and awe-inspirin g sight, the miracle of the Universe, that these miracles (in God's providen tial guidance of His people) are but child's play for the Divine Power. But the truly miraculous has become despised through famili arity. The universal, on the contrary, although in itself insigni ficant, yet, through our love of novelty, transports us with amazement.\" In opposition to the anthropopathism of the Jewish Scriptures, the Alexandrian Jews endeavored to purify the id ea of God from all admixture of the Human. By the exclusion of every human passion, it was sublimat ed to a something devo id of all attributes, and wholly transcendent al; and the mere Being, the Good, in and by itself, the Absolute of Platonism , was substituted for the personal Deity of the Old Testament. By soaring up- ward, beyond all creat ed existence, the mind, disengaging itself from the Sensible, attain s to the intellectual intuition of this Ab- solute Being; of w hom, however, it can predicate nothing but existence, and sets aside all othe r determinations as not answering to the exalted nature of the Supreme Essence. Thus Philo makes a distinction between those who are in the proper sense Sons of God, having by m eans of contemplation raised themselves to the highest Be ing, or attained to a knowledge of Him, in His immediate self-m anifestation, and those who know God only in his mediat e revelation through hi s operation--such as He declares Himself in creation--in the revelation st ill veiled in the letter of Scripture--those, in short, who atta ch themselves simply to the Logos, and consider this to be the Supreme God; who are the sons of the Logos, rather than of the True Being. \"God,\" says Pythagoras, \"is neith er the object of sense, nor subject to passion, but invisible, only intell igible, and supremely intelligent. In His body He is like the light, and in His soul He re- sembles truth. He is the universal spirit that pervades and dif- fuseth itself over all nature. Al l beings receive their life from Him. There is but one only God, who is not, as some are apt to imagine, seated above the world, beyond the orb of the Universe; but being Himself all in all, He sees all the bein gs that fill His immensity; the only Principle, th e Light of Heav en, the Father of all. He produces everything; He orders and disposes every- thing; He is the REASON, the LI FE, and the MOTION of all being.\" \"I am the LIGHT of the world;he that fo lloweth Me shall not walk in DARKNESS, but shall have the LIGHT of LIFE.\" So said the Founder of t he Christian Religion, as His words are reported"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"by John the Apostle. God, say the sacred wr itings of the Jews, appeared to Moses in a FLAME OF FIRE, in t he midst of a bush, which was not consumed.

Before all things, existed th e Primitive Being, THE ANCIENT OF DAYS, the Ancient Ki ng of Light; a title the more remarkable, because it is frequent ly given to the Creator in the Zend-Avesta, and in the Code of the Sabeans, and occurs in the Jewish Scriptures. The world was His Revelation, God revealed; and subsisted only in Him. His attributes were there reproduced with various modifications and in different degree s; so that the Universe was His Holy Splendor, His Mantle. He was to be adored in silence; and perfection consisted in a nearer approach to Him. Before the creation of worlds, the PRIMITIVE LIGHT filled all space, so that there was no vo id. When the Supreme Being, ex- isting in this Light, resolved to display His perfections, or mani- fest them in worlds, He with drew within Himself, formed around Him a void space, and shot fort h His first emanation, a ray of light; the cause and principle of everythi ng that exists, uniting both the generative and conceptive power, whic h penetrates every- thing, and with out which nothing could subsist for an instant. Man fell, seduced by the Evil Spirits most remote from the Great King of Light; th ose of the four th world of spirits, Asiah, whose chief was Belial. They wa ge incessant war against the pure Intelligences of th e other worlds, who, like the Amshaspands, Izeds, and Ferouers of the Persia ns are the tutelary guardians of man. In the beginning , all was unison and ha rmony; full of the same divine light an d perfect purity. The Seven Kings of Evil fell, and the Universe was troubled. Then t he Creator took from the Seven Kings the principles of Good and of Light, and divided them among the four worlds of Spir its, giving to the first three the Pure Intelligences, united in love and harmony , while to the fourth were vouchsafed only so me feeble glimmerings of light. When the strife betw een these and the g ood angels shall have continued the a ppointed time, and these Sp irits enveloped in dark- ness shall long and in vain have endeavored to absorb the Divine light and life, then wi ll the Eternal Himself come to correct them.

Light, as contradistingu ished from darkness, is Good, as contradis- tinguished from Evil: a nd it is that Light, the true knowledge of Deity, the Eternal Good , for which Masons in all ages have sought. Still Masonry marches steadily onward toward that Light that shines in the great distance, t he Light of that day when Evil, overcome and vanquished, shall fade away and disappear forever, and Life and Light be th e one law of the Univer se, and its eternal Harmony. The Degree of Rose Croix teaches three things;--the unity, im- mutability and goodness of God; the immortality of the Soul; and the ultimate defeat and extincti on of evil and wrong and sor- row, by a Redeemer or Messiah, yet to come, if he has not already appeared. It replaces the three pillars of the old Temp le, with three that have already been explai ned to you,--Faith [i n God, mankind, and man's self], Hope [in the victor y over evil, the advancement of Humanity, and a hereafter], and C harity [relieving the wants, and tolerant of the erro rs and faults of others ]. To be trustful, to be hopeful, to be indulgen t; these, in an age of selfishness, of ill opinion of human nature, of harsh and bitter judgment, are the most important Masonic Virtues, and the true supports of every Masonic Temple. And they are t he old pillars of the Temple under different names.

The Cross has been a sacred symbo l from the earli est Antiquity.

The Druids cut an oak into its shape and hel d it sacred, and built their temples in that form. Pointing to the four quarters of the world, it was the symbol of universal na ture. It was on a cruciform tree, that Chrishna was said to have expired, pierced with arrows. It was revered in Mexico.

How we read it, I need not repeat to you. The CROSS, X, was t he Sign of the Creative Wisdom or Logos, the Son of God. Plato says, \"H e expressed him upon the Uni- verse in the figure of the lett er X. The next Po wer to the Su- preme God was decussated or figu red in the shape of a Cross on the Universe.\" Mithras signed his soldiers on the forehead with a Cross. X is the mark of 600, the mysteri ous cycle of the Incar- nations. We constantly see the Tau and t he Resh united thus P . These -|- | two letters, in the ol d Samaritan, as found in Arius, stand, the first for 400, the seco nd for 200=600. Th is is the Staff of Osiris, also, and his monogram , and was adopted by t he Christians as a Sign. On a medal P of Constanius is this inscription, \"In hoc X |"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"signo victor eris.\" An inscri ption in the Du omo at Milan reads, \"X. et P. Christi. Nomina. Sancta.

The vestments of the ptiests of Horu s were covered with these crosses. So was the dress of the Lama of Thibet. The Sectar ian marks of the Jains are similar. The distin ctive badge of the Sect of Xac Jaonicus is the swastica. It is the Sign of Fo, i dentical with the Cr oss of Christ. On the ruins of Mandore, in India, amon g other mystic emblems, are the mystic triangle, and the interlaced triangle. This is also found on ancient coins and medals, excavated from th e ruins of Oojein and other ancient cities of India. You entered here amid gloom and into shadow, and are clad in the apparel of sorrow. Lament, with us, the sad condition of the Human race, in this vale of tear s! the calamities of men and the agonies of nations! the darkness of the bewildered s oul, oppressed by doubt and apprehension! There is no human soul that is no t sad at times. There is no thoughtful soul that does not at times despa ir. There is perhaps none, of all that think at all of anyt hing beyond the needs and in- terests of the body, that is not at times startled and terrified by the awful questions which, feeling as though it were a guilty thing for doing so, it whispers to itself in its inmost depths. Some Demon seems to torture it with doubts, and to crush it with despair, ask- ing whether, after all, it is cert ain that its convictions are true, and its faith well rounded : whether it is indeed sure that a God of Infinite Love and Beneficence ru les the Universe , or only some great remorseless Fate and iron Necessity, hid in impenetrable gloom, and to which m en and their sufferings and sorrows. their hopes and joys, their am bitions and deeds, are of no more interest or importance than the motes that d ance in the sunshine; or a Being that amuses Himself with the incredible vanity and folly, the writings and cont ortions of the insigni ficant insects that compose Humanity, and idly imagine that th ey resemble the Om- nipotent. \"What are we,\" the Te mpter asks, \"but puppets in a show-box ? O Omnipotent destiny, pull our strings gently ! Dance us mercifully off our mi serable little stage !\" \"Is it not,\" the Demon whispers, \"merely the inordinate vanity of man that causes hi m now to pretend to hi mself that he is like unto God in intellect, sympathies and passions, as it was that which, at the beginning, made him be lieve that he was, in his bodily shape and organs, the very image of the Deit y ? Is not his God merely his own shadow, projected in gigantic outlines upon the clouds? Does he not create for hi mself a God out of himself, by merely adding indefinite extensi on to his own faculties, powers, and passions?\" \"Who,\" the Voice that will not be always silent whispers, \"has ever thoroughly satisf ied himself with his own arguments in re- spect to his own nature ?

Who has ever done more than to utter nonsense and incoherencies in rega rd to the difference between the instincts of the dog and the reason of Man ? The horse, the dog, the elephant, are as conscious of their identity as we are. They think, dream, remember, argue with themselves, devise, plan, and reason.

And with still more te rrible significance, th e Voice asks, in what respect the masses of men, the vast swarms of the human race, have proven themselves either wiser or better than the animals in whose eyes a higher inte lligence shines than in their dull, unintel- lectural orbs; in what respect t hey have proven themselves worthy of or suited for an immo rtal life. Would that be a prize of any value to the vast majority? Do they show, here upon earth, any capacity to improve, any fitness fo r a state of existence in which they could not crouch to power, like hounds dreading the lash, or tyrannize over defenceless weakness; in which they could not hate, and persecute, and torture, and exterminate; in which they could not trade, and specul ate, and over-reach, and entrap the-unwary and cheat the confiding and gamble and thrive , and sniff with self- righteousness at the short-comings of others, and thank God that they were not like other men? What, to immense numbers of men, would be the val ue of a Heaven where they coul d not lie and libel, and ply base avocations for profitable returns ? Sadly we look around us, and read th e gloomy and dreary rec- ords of the old dead and rotten ages. More t han eighteen centuries have staggered away into the spec tral realm of the Past, since Christ, teaching the Reli gion of Love, was cruc ified, that it might become a Religion of Hate; and His Doctrines are not yet even nominally accepted as true by a fourth of mankind. Since His death, what incalculable swarms of human beings have lived and died in total unbelief of all that we deem e ssential to Salvation! What multitudinous myriad s of souls, since th e darkness of idola- trous superstition se ttled down, thi ck and impenetra ble, upon the earth, have flocked up toward th e eternal Throne of God, to receive His judgment ? The Religion of Love proved to be, for sevent een long cen- turies, as much the Religion of Hate, and infinitely more the Re- ligion of Persecution, than Mahometani sm, its unconquerable rival. Heresies grew up before the Apos tles died; and God hated the Nicolaitans, while John, at Patmos , proclaimed His coming wrath.

Why have not those other ani- mals that only faintly imitate the wanton, sav age, human cruelty and thirst for blood, the same right as man ha s, to expect a resur- rection and an Eternity of existence, or a Heaven of Love? The world improves. Man ceases to persecute,--when the per- secuted become too numer ous and strong, longer to submit to it.

To deprive other creatu res of the life whic h God gave them, and this not only that we may eat thei r flesh for food, but out of mere savage wantonness, is the agreeable employ ment and amusement of man, who prides himself on bei ng the Lord of Creation, and a little lower than the A ngels.

Where the armies of the despots cease to slay and ravage, the armies of \"Freedom\" take their place, and, the black and white commingled, slaughter and burn and ravish.

It is the Statue of Olympian Jove, worshipped as the Fat her, in the Ch ristian Church that was a Pagan Temple;it is the Statue of Venus, become the Virgin Mary. For the most part, men do not in their hearts believe that God is either just or merciful. They fe ar and shrink fr om His lightnings and dread His wrath. For the most part, they only think they believe that there is another life, a judgm ent, and a pu nishment for sin. Yet they will none the less persecut e as Infidels and Athe- ists those who do not bel ieve what they them selves imagine they believe, and which yet they do not be lieve, because it is incompre- hensible to them in t heir ignorance and want of intellect. To the vast majority of mankind, God is but the reflect ed image, in infi- nite space, of the earthly Tyrant on his Throne, only more power- ful, more inscrutable, and more implacable. To curse Humanity, the Despot need only be, what the popular mind has, in every age, imagined God. In the great cities, the lower stra ta of the popula ce are equally without faith and without hope. The others have, for the most part, a mere blind fa ith, imposed by educa tion and circumstances, and not as productive of moral excellence or even common honesty as Mohammedanism. \"Your property will be safe here,\" said the Moslem; \"There are no Christ ians here.\" The philosophical and scientific world becomes daily more and more unbelieving. Faith and Reason are not opposites, in equi librium; but antago- nistic and hostile to each other; the result being the darkness and despair of scepticism, avowed, or half-ve iled as rationalism. Over more than three-fourths of the habitable gl obe, humanity still kneels, like the ca mels, to take upon itself the burthens to be tamely borne for its tyra nts. If a Republic o ccasionally rises like a Star, it hastens with all speed to set in bl ood. The ki ngs need not make war upon it, to crus h it out of their way. It is only neces- sary to let it alone, and it soon lays violent hands upon itself.

Moreover, the Voice says, this besot ted race is not satisfied with seeing its multitudes swept away by the great epidemics whose causes are unknown, and of the ju stice or wisdom of which the human mind cannot conceive . It must also be ever at war. There has not been a moment since men divided in to Tribes, when all the world was at peace. Always men have been engaged in mur- dering each other somewhere. Al ways the armies have lived by the toil of the husbandman, and wa r has exhausted the resources, wasted the energies, and ended the prosperity of Nations. Now it loads unborn posterity with crushi ng debt, mortgages all estates, and brings upon States the shame and infamy of dishonest re- pudiation.

Th en again the flames fl icker and die away, and the fire smoulders in its ashes, to break out again, after a time, with renewed and a more concentrated fury. At times, the storm, revolving, howls over smal l areas only; at times its lights are seen, like the old beacon-fires on the hills, belting the whole globe. No sea, but hears the roar of ca nnon; no river, but runs red with blood; no pl ain, but shakes, tram pled by the hoofs of charging squadrons; no fi eld, but is fertilized by the blood of the dead; and everywhere man sl ays, the vulture go rges, and the wolf howls in the ear of the dying so ldier. No city is not tortured by shot and shell; and no people fail to enact the horrid blas- phemy of thanking a God of Love for victories and carnage. Te Deums are still sung for the Ev e of St. Bartholomew and the Sicilian Vespers. Man' s ingenuity is racked, and all his inventive powers are tasked, to fabricate th e infernal enginer y of destruc- tion, by which human bodies may be the mo re expeditiously and effectually crushed, shattered, to rn, and mangled; and yet hypo- critical Humanity, drunk with blood and drenche d with gore, shrieks to Heaven at a single murder, perpetra ted to gratify a re- venge not more unchristian, or to sati sfy a cupidity not more ignoble, than those which are the promptings of the Devil in the souls of Nations.

The crash of a new eruption wakes us, th e roar of the sub- terranean thunders, the stabs of the volcanic lightning into the shrouded bosom of the sky; and we see, aghast, the tortured Titan hurling up its fires among the pale stars, its great tree of smoke and cloud, the red torrents pouring down it s sides.

God seems to have abdicated, and Moloch to reign in His stead; while Press and Pulpit alike exult at universal murder, and urge the exterm ination of the Conquered, by the sword and the flaming torch; and to plunder and murder entitles the human beasts of prey to the th anks of Christian Senates. Commercial greed deadens the ne rves of sympathy of Nations, and makes them deaf to the demands of ho nor, the impulses of generosity, the appeals of those who suffer under injustice.

The villanies of legalized gaming an d speculation become epidemic; treacery is but evidenc e of shrewdness; offi ce becomes the prey of successful faction; the Country, like Actaeon, is torn by its own hounds, and the villa ins it has carefully educ ated to their trade, most greedily plunder it, when it is in extremis.

Doubting man's capacity for indefinite pr ogress here, he doubts t he possibility of it anywher; and if he doe s not doubt whether God exists, and is just and beneficent, he at least cannot silenc e the constantly recur- ring whisper, that the mi series and calamities of men, their lives and deaths, their pains and sorrows, their ex termination by war and epidemics, are pheno mena of no hi gher dignity, significance, and importance, in the ey e of God, than what things of the same nature occur to other organisms of matter; and that the fish of the ancient seas, destroyed by my riads to make room for other species, the contorte d shapes in which they are found as fossils testifying to their ago nies; the coral insect s, the animals and birds and vermin slain by man, have as much right as he to clamor at the injustice of the dispensa tions of God, and to demand an immortality of life in a new universe, as compensation for their pains and sufferings and unti mely death in this world. This is not a picture painted by the imagination. Many a thoughtful mind has so doubted and des paired. How many of us can say that our own faith is so well grounded and complete that we never hear those painful whispe rings within th e soul? Thrice blessed are they who never doubt, who ruminate in patient con- tentment like the kine, or doze under the opiat e of a blind faith; on whose souls never re sts that Awful Shado w which is the ab- sence of the Divine Light. To explain to themselves the ex istence of Evil and Suffering, the Ancient Persians imagined that there were two Principles or Deities in the Universe, the one of Good and the other of Evil, constantly in conflict with each other in struggle for the mastery, and alternately overcoming and ov ercome. Over both, for the SAGES, was the One Supr eme; and for them Li ght was in the end to prevail over Darkness, the G ood over the Evil , and even Ahri- man and his Demons to part with their wicke d and vicious natures and share the universal Salvation. It did not occur to them that the existence of the Evil Principl e, by the consent of the Omnipo- tent Supreme, presented the same difficulty, and left the existence of Evil as unexplained as befo re. The human mind is always content, if it can remove a difficulty a step fu rther off. It cannot believe that the worl d rests on nothing, but is devoutly content when taught that it is borne on the back of an immense elephant, who himself stands on the back of a tortoise.

Those only, who care for nothing beyond the interests and pur- suits of this life, are uninterest ed in these great Problems. The animals, also, do not cons ider them.

Exalt and magnif y Faith as we will, and say that it begins where Reason ends, it must, after all, have a foundati on, either in Reason, Analogy, the Consciousne ss, or human testimony. The worshipper of Brahma also has impl icit Faith in what seems to us palpably false and absurd. His faith rests neither in Reason, Analogy, or the Consciousness, but on the testimony of his Spirit- ual teachers, and of the Holy Boo ks. The Moslem also believes, on the positive testimony of th e Prophet; and t he Mormon also can say, \"I believe this, because it is impossible.\" No faith, how- ever absurd or degrading, has ever wanted these foundations, testimony, and the books. Miracles, proven by unimpeachable testimony have been used as a foundation for Fa ith, in every age; and the modern miracles are be tter authenticated, a hundred times, than the ancient ones. So that, after all, Fa ith must flow out from some source within us, when the evidence of that which we are to believe is not pre- sented to our senses , or it will in no case be the assurance of the truth of what is believed. The Consciousness, or inhering and innate conviction, or the instinct divinely implan ted, of the verity of things, is the highest possible evidence, if not the only re al proof, of the verity of cer- tain things, but only of tr uths of a limited class.

To them, all the lights of the fi rmament were created only to give light to t he earth, as its lamps or candles hung above it. The earth was supposed to be the only inha bited portion of the Uni- verse. The world and the Univer se were synonymous terms. Of the immense size and distance of the heavenly b odies, men had no conception. The Sages had, in Chaldaea, Egypt, India, China, and in Persia, and ther efore the sages always had, an esoteric creed, taught only in the mysteries and unk nown to the vulgar. No Sage, in either country, or in Greece or Rome, believed the popular creed. To them the Gods and the Idol s of the Gods were symbols, and symbols of grea t and mysterious truths. The Vulgar imagined the attention of the Gods to be continu- ally centred upon the earth and man. The Gr ecian Divinities in- habited Olympus, an insi gnificant mountain of the Earth. There was the Court of Zeus, to which Neptune came from the Sea, and Pluto and Persephone from the gl ooms of Tartarus in the un- fathomable depths of the Earth' s bosom. God came down from Heaven and on Sinai dictated laws for the Hebrews to His servant Moses. The Stars were the guardians of mo rtals whose fates and fortunes were to be read in th eir movements, conjunctions, and oppositions. The Moon wa s the Bride and Sister of the Sun, at the same distance above the Earth, and, like t he Sun, made for the service of mankind alone. If, with the great telescope of Lord Rosse, we examine the vast nebulae of Hercules, Or ion, and Andromeda, and find them re- solvable into Stars more numero us than the sand s on the sea- shore; if we reflect that each of these Stars is a Sun, like and even many times larger than ours,--each, beyo nd a doubt, with its retinue of worlds swarming with li fe; --if we go further in imagi- nation and endeavor to conceive of all the infinities of space, filled with similar suns and worlds, we seem at once to shrink into an incredible insignificance.

The modes in which it is ordina rily endeavored to satisfy our doubts, only increase them. To demonstrate the necessity for a cause of the creation, is equally to demonstr ate the necessity of a cause for that cause. The argument from plan and design only removes the difficulty a step further off. We rest the world on the elephant, and t he elephant on the tortoise, and the tortoise on ---nothing. To tell us that the animals po ssess instinct only and that Rea- son belongs to us alone, in no way tends to satisfy us of the radi- cal difference between us and them. For if the mental phenomena exhibited by animals that thin k, dream, remember, argue from cause to effect, plan, devise, combine, and co mmunicate their thoughts to each other, so as to act rationally in concert,--if their love, hate, and revenge, can be conceived of as results of the organization of matter, like color and perfume, the resort to the hypothesis of an immaterial Soul to explain phenomena of the same kind, only more perfect, mani fested by the hum an being, is supremely absurd. That organized matter can think or even feel, at all, is the great insoluble mystery. \"Ins tinct\" is but a word without a meaning, or else it means inspirat ion. It is either the animal itself, or God in the animal, that thinks, remembers, and reasons; and instinct, according to the common acceptation of the term, would be the greatest and mo st wonderful of mysteries,- no less a thing than t he direct, immediate, and continual prompt- ings of the Deity,--for the animal s are not machines , or automata moved by springs, and the ape is but a dumb Australian.

It would be tedious to repeat all the interp retations which fancy or dullness has found for them. The key to their true meaning is not undi scoverable. The per- fect and eternal distinct ion of the two primitiv e terms of the cre- ative syllogism, in order to attain to the demonstra tion of their harmony by the analogy of cont raries, is the second grand prin- ciple of that occult philosophy veiled under the name \"Kabalah,\" and indicated by all t he sacred hieroglyphs of the Ancient Sanctu- aries, and of the rite s, so little understo od by the mass of the Initiates, of the Ancient and Modern Free-Masonry. The Sohar declares that everythi ng in the Universe proceeds by the mystery of \"the Balance,\" that is, of Equilibrium. Of the Sephiroth, or Divi ne Emanations, Wisdom and Understanding, Severity and B enignity, or Justice and Mercy, and Victory and Glory, constitute pairs. Wisdom, or the Intellectual G enerative Energy, and Under- standing, or the Capacity to be im pregnated by the Active Energy and produce intellection or thought, are repr esented symbolically in the Kabalah as ma le and female. So al so are Justice and Mercy. Strength is the intellectu al Energy or Activity; Estab- lishment or Stability is the inte llectual Capacity to produce, a Tpassivity. They are the POWER of generation a nd the CAPACITY of production. By WISD OM, it is said, God creates, and by UN- DERSTANDING establishes. Thes e are the two Columns of the Temple, contraries like the M an and Woman, like Reason and Faith, Omnipotence and Liberty, Infinite Ju stice and Infinite Mercy, Absolute Power or Strength to do even what is most un- just and unwise, and Abso lute Wisdom that ma kes it impossible to do it; Right and Duty. Th ey were the columns of the intellectual and moral world, the monumental hieroglyph of the antinomy necessary to the grand law of creation. There must be for every Force a Resistance to support it, to every light a shadow, for every Royalty a Realm to govern, for every affirmative a negative. For the Kabalists, Light represen ts the Active Principle, and Darkness or Shadow is analogous to t he Passive Principle. There- fore it was that they made of the Sun and Moon emblems of the two Divine Sexes and the tw o creative forces; th erefore, that they ascribed to woman the Temptation and the first sin, and then the"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"first labor, the matern al labor of th e redemption, because it is from the bosom of the darkness itself that we see the Light born again. The Void attracts the Full; and so it is that the abyss of poverty and misery, th e Seeming Evil, the seeming empty noth- ingness of life, the te mporary rebellion of the creatures, eternally attracts the overflowing ocean of being, of ri ches, of pity, and of love. Christ completed the Atone ment on the Cr oss by descend- ing into Hell. Justice and Mercy are contraries . If each be infinite, their co- existence seems impossible, and being equal, one cannot even annihilate the other and reign alone. The m ysteries of the Divine Nature are beyond our finite co mprehension; but so indeed are the mysteries of our ow n finite nature; and it is certain that in all nature harmony and movement ar e the result of the equilibrium of opposing or contrary forces. The analogy of contra ries gives the soluti on of the most inter- esting and most diffic ult problem of mode rn philosophy,--the definite and permanent a ccord of Reason and Faith, of Author- ity and Liberty of examination, of Science and Beli ef, of Perfec- tion in God and Imperfection in Man. If science or knowledge is the Sun, Belief is the Man; it is a reflection of the day in the night. Faith is the veiled Isis, the Supplement of Reason, in the shadows which precede or follow Reason. It emanates from the Reason, but can never confound it nor be confounde d with it. The encroachments of Reason upon Faith, or of Faith on Reason, are eclipses of the Sun or Moon; when they occur, they make useless both the Source of Light a nd its reflection, at once. Science perishes by systems that are nothing but beliefs; and Faith succumbs to reasoning. Fo r the two Columns of the Tem- ple to uphold the edi fice, they must rema in separated and be parallel to each other. As soon as it is attempte d by violence to bring them together, as Samson did, they ar e overturned, and the whole edifice falls up on the head of the rash blind man or the revolutionist whom personal or national resentments have in ad- vance devoted to death. Harmony is the result of an alternating preponderance of forces. Whenever this is wanti ng in government , government is a failure, because it is either Despotism or Anar chy. All theoret- ical governments, however plausi ble the theory, end in one or the other. Governments that are to endure are not made in the closet of Locke or Shaftesbury, or in a Congress or a C onvention. In a Republic, forces that seem contra ries, that indeed are contraries, alone give movement and life. The Spheres are field in their orbits and made to revolve harmo niously and uner ringly, by the concurrence, which seems to be the opposition, of two contrary forces. If the centripetal force s hould overcome the centrifugal, the equilibrium of forc es cease, the rush of the Spheres to the central Sun would annihilate th e system. Instead of consolida- tion, the whole would be shattered into fragments. Man is a free agent, though Omnipotence is above and all"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"around him. To be fr ee to do good, he must be free to do evil. The Light necessitates the Shadow . A State is free like an indi- vidual in any government worthy of the name. T he State is less potent than the De ity, and therefore the fr eedom of the individual citizen is consistent with its Sovereignty. Thes e are opposites, but not antagonistic. So, in a uni on of States, th e freedom of the states is consistent with th e Supremacy of the Nation. When either obtains the pe rmanent mastery over th e other, and they cease to be in equilibrio, the en croachment continues with a ve- locity that is accelerated like that of a falli ng body, until the feebler is annihilated, and then, there being no resistance to sup- port the stronger, it rushes into ruin. So, when the equipoise of Reason and Faith, in the individual or the Nation, and t he alternating preponderanc e cease, the result is, according as one or the other is permanent victor, Atheism or Superstition, disbelief or blind credulity; and the Priests either of Unfaith or of Fa ith become despotic. \"Whomsoever God loveth, him he chasteneth,\" is an expression that formulates a whol e dogma. The trials of life are the bless- ings of life, to the in dividual or the Nation, if either has a Soul that is truly worthy of salvat ion. \"Light and darkness,\" said ZOROASTER, \"are the world's et ernal ways.\" The Light and the Shadow are everywhere and always in proport ion; the Light being the reason of being of the Shadow. It is by trials only, by the agonies of sorrow and the sharp discipline of adversities, that men and Nations attain initiation. The agonies of the garden of Geth- semane and those of th e Cross on Calvary pr eceded the Resurrec- tion and were the means of Redempt ion. It is with prosperity that God afflicts Humanity. The Degree of Rose is devot ed to and symbolizes tne final triumph of truth over fa lsehood, of liberty ov er slavery, of light over darkness, of li fe over death, and of good over evil. The great truth it inculcates is, that notwithstanding the existence of Evil, God is infinitely wise, jus t, and good: that t hough the affairs of the world proceed by no rule of right and wro ng known to us in the narrowness of our views, yet all is right, for it is the work of God; and all evils, all miseries, all misfortunes, are but as drops in the vast current that is sweepi ng onward, guided by Him, to a great and magnificent result: tha t, at the appoint ed time, He will redeem and regene rate the world, and the Principle, the Power, and the existence of Evil will then cease; that this will be brought about by such means and instrume nts as He chooses to employ; whether by the merits of a Red eemer that has al ready appeared, or a Messiah that is yet waited for, by an in carnation of Himself, or by an inspired prophet , it does not belong to us as Masons to decide. Let each judge a nd believe for himself. In the mean time, we labor to hasten the co ming of that day. The morals of antiquity , of the law of Moses and of Christianity, are ours.

No one Mason has the right to measure for another, within the walls of a Masonic Temple, the degree of veneration which he shall feel for any Reformer, or the Founder of any Religion. We teach a belief in no particular creed, as we teach unbe lief in none. Whatever higher attributes the Founder of the Christian Faith may, in our belief, ha ve had or not have had, none can deny that He taught and practised a pure and elevated mo rality, even at the risk and to the ultimate loss of His life. He wa s not only the benefactor of a disinhe rited people, bu t a model for mankind. De- votedly He loved the children of Israel. To them He came, and to them alone He preached that Gospel which His disciples after- ward carried among foreigners. He would fain have freed the chosen People from t heir spiritual bondage of ignorance and deg- radation. As a lover of all mankind, laying down His life for the emancipation of His Brethr en, He should be to al l, to Christian, to Jew, and to Mahometa n, an object of gratit ude and veneration. The Roman world felt the pangs of approaching dissolution. Paganism, its Temples shattered by Socrates and Cicero, had spoken its last word . The God of the Hebr ews was unknown be- yond the limits of Pale stine. The old religions had failed to give happiness and peace to the world. The babbling and wrangling philosophers had confoun ded all men's ideas, until th ey doubted of everything and had fait h in nothing: neither in God nor in his goodness and mercy, nor in the virtue of man, nor in themselves. Mankind was divided into two grea t classes,-- the master and the slave; the powerful and the ab ject, the high and the low, the tyrants and the mob; and even the former were satiated with the servility of the latter, sunken by lassitude and despai r to the low- est depths of degradation. When, lo, a voice, in the inco nsiderable Roman Province of Judea proclaims a new Gospel--a ne w \"God's Word,\" to crushed, suffering, bleeding huma nity. Liberty of Thoug ht, Equality of all men in the eye of God, universa l Fraternity! a new doctrine, a new religion; the old Primitiv e Truth uttered once again! Man is once more t aught to look upw ard to his God. No longer to a God hid in impenet rable mystery, and infi nitely remote from human sympathy, emerging only at intervals from the darkness to smite and crush humani ty: but a God, good, kind, beneficent, and merciful; a Father, loving the cr eatures He has made, with a love immeasurable and exha ustless; Who feels for us, and sympa- thizes with us, and sends us pain and want and disast er only that they may serve to develop in us the virtues and e xcellences that befit us to live with Him hereafter.

He pard ons the woman taken in adultery. He selects his disciples not among the Ph arisees or the Philosophers, but among the low and humble, even of the fisher- men of Galilee. He heals the sick and feeds the poor. He lives among the destitute and the friendless. \"Suffe r little children,\" He said, \"to come unto me; for of such is the kingdom of Heaven ! Blessed are the humble -minded, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven; the meek, for they shall inherit the Earth; the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy; the pure in heart, fo r they shall see God; the peace-makers, for they shall be called th e children of God!

A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another: as I have loved you, that ye also lo ve one another: by this shall all know that ye are My disciples . Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friend.\" The Gospel of Love He sealed with His li fe. The cruelty of the Jewish Priesthood, th e ignorant ferocity of the mob, and the Roman indifference to barbarian blood, nailed Him to the cross, and He expired ut tering blessings upon humanity.

GRAND PONTIFF. The true Mason labors for the benef it of those who are to come after him, and for t he advancement and improv ement of his race. That is a poor ambiti on which contents itself within the limits of a single life. All men w ho deserve to live, des ire to survive their funerals, and to live afterward in the g ood that they have done mankind, rather than in the fading characte rs written in men's memories. Most men desire to leav e some work be hind them that may outlast their own day and brief generation . That is an in- stinctive impulse, given by God, and often foun d in the rudest human heart; the surest proof of the soul's immortality, and of the fundamental difference betwe en man and the wisest brutes. To plant the trees that, after we are dead, shall shelter our chil- dren, is as natural as to love t he shade of those our fathers planted. The rudest unlettered hus bandman, painfully co nscious of his own inferiority, the poore st widowed mother, givi ng her life-blood to those who pay only for the work of her needle, will toil and stint themselves to educate their child, that he ma y take a higher sta- tion in the world than they;--and of such ar e the world's greatest benefactors. In his influences that survive him, man becomes immortal, be- fore the general resurrection. The Spartan mother, who, giving her son his shield, said, \"WITH IT , OR UPON IT!\" afterward shared the government of Lac edaemon with t he legislation of Lycurgus; for she too made a law, that lived after her ; and she inspired the Spartan soldiery that afterward demolished the walls of Athens, and aided Alexander to conquer the Orient. The widow who gave Marion the fiery arrows to burn her own hous e, that it might no longer shelter the enemi es of her infant c ountry, the house where she had lain upon her husband's bosom, and where her children had been born, legislated more effectually fo r her State than Locke or Shaftesbury, or than many a Legislature has done, since that State won its freedom.

Napoleon died upon the barren rock of hi s exile. His bones, borne to France by the s on of a King, rest in the Hopital des In- valides, in the great city on the Seine. His Thoughts still govern France. He, and not the Peopl e, dethroned the Bourbon, and drove the last King of the Hous e of Orleans into exile. He, in his coffin, and not the People, voted the crow n to the Third Napo- leon; and he, and not the Generals of Fran ce and England, led their united forces against t he grim Northern Despotism.

The law of Mahomet still governs a fourth of the human race; and Turk and Arab, Moor and Persian and Hi ndu, still obey the Prophet, and pray with their faces turned toward Mecca; and he, and not the living, rules and reigns in the fairest po rtions of the Orient. Confucius still enacts the la w for China; and the thoughts and ideas of Peter the Great govern Russia.

And still the years came and passed away again, and William, the Norman Bas- tard, parcelled England out among his Barons, and still th e sapling grew, and the dews fed its leaves , and the birds build ed their nests among its small limbs for many generati ons. And still the years came and went, and th e Indian hunter slept in the shade of the sapling, and Richard Li on-Heart fought at Ac re and Ascalon, and John's bold Barons wrested fr om him the Great Charter; and the sapling had become a tree; an d still it grew, and thrust its great arms wider abroad, and lift ed its head stil l higher toward the Heavens; strong-root ed, and defi ant of the storms that roared and eddied through its branches; and when Columbus ploughed with his keels the unknown We stern Atlantic, and Cortez and Pizarro bathed the cro ss in blood; and the Puritan, the Huguenot, the Cavalier, and the follower of Penn sought a ref uge and a rest- ing-place beyond the oc ean, the Great Oak still sto od, firm-rooted, vigorous, stately, h aughtily domineering over all the forest, heed- less of all the centuries that h ad hurried past since the wild Indian planted the little acor n in the forest ;--a stout and hale old tree, with wide circumference shading many a rood of ground; and fit to furnish timbers for a ship, to carry the thunders of the Great Republic's guns around the worl d. And yet, if one had sat and watched it every instant, from th e moment when the feeble shoot first pushed its way to the light until the eagles built among its branches, he would never have se en the tree or sapling grow. Many long centuries ago, be fore the Chal daean Shepherds watched the Stars, or Shufu built the Pyra mids, one could have sailed in a seventy-four where no w a thousand islands gem the sur- face of the Indian Ocean; and the deep-sea le ad would nowhere have found any bottom . But below these wa ves were myriads upon myriads, beyond the power of Arithmetic to number, of minute existences, each a perfect living creature, made by the Al- mighty Creator, and fa shioned by Him for the work it had to do There they toiled be neath the waters, each do ing its allo tted work, and wholly ignorant of the result whic h God intended. They lived and died, incalculable in num bers and almost infinite in the succession of their gener ations, each adding hi s mite to the gigan- tic work that went on there under God's di rection. Thus hath He chosen to create grea t Continents and Islands; and still the coral- insects live and work, as when they made th e rocks that underlie the valley of the Ohio. Thus God hath chosen to create. Where no w is firm land, once chafed and thund ered the great primeval ocean. For ages upon ages the minute shields of infinite myriads of infusoria, and the "},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"stony stems of encrinites sunk into its depths, and there, under the vast pressure of its waters , hardened into limestone. Raised slowly from the Profound by Hi s hand, its quarr ies underlie the soil of all the conti nents, hundreds of feet in thickness; and we, of these remains of the countle ss dead, build to mbs and palaces, as the Egyptians, whom we call ancient, built their pyramids. On all the broad lake s and oceans the Great Sun looks earnestly and lovingly, and the in visible vapors rise ev er up to meet him. No eye but God's behold s them as they rise . There, in the upper atmospere, they are condensed to mist , and gather into clouds, and float and swim around in the ambient air. They sail with its currents, and hover ov er the ocean, and roll in huge masses round the stony shoulders of great m ountains. Condensed still more by change of temperature, they drop upon the th irsty earth in gentle showers, or pour upon it in heavy rains, or storm against its bosom at the angry Equinoctial. The s hower, the rain, and the storm pass away, the clouds vanish, and the bright stars again shine clearly upon the gl ad earth. The ra in-drops sink in to the ground, and gather in subterranean reserv oirs, and run in subterranean channels, and bubble up in springs and fountains; and from the mountain-sides and head s of valleys the silv er threads of water begin their long journey to the ocean. Unit ing, they widen into brooks and rivulets, then into stream s and rivers; and, at last, a Nile, Ganges, a Danube , an Amazon, or a Mississippi rolls be- tween its banks, mighty, majestic, and resistless, creat ing vast allu- vial valleys to be t he granaries of the worl d, ploughed by the thousand keels of co mmerce and serving as great highways, and as the impassable boundar ies of rival nations ; ever returning to the ocean the drops that rose fr om it in vapor, and descended in rain and snow and hail upon the level plains and lofty moun- tains; and causing hi m to recoil for many a mile before the long rush of their great tide. So it is with the aggregate of Human end eavor. As the invis- ible particles of vapor combine an d coalesce to form the mists and clouds that fall in rain on thir sty continents, and bless the great green forests and wide grassy prai ries, the waving meadows and the fields by which men live; as the infinite myriads of drops that the glad earth drinks ar e gathered into spring s and rivulets and rivers, to aid in levelling the mountains and elevat ing the plains, and to feed the large lakes and restle ss oceans; so all Human Thought, and Speech and Action, all that is done and said and thought and suffered upon the Earth combi ne together, and flow onward in one broad resi stless current toward those great results to which they are determ ined by the will of God. We build slowly and destroy swiftly. Ou r Ancient Brethren who built the Temples at Jerusalem, with many myriad blows felled, hewed, and squared the ceda rs, and quarried the stones, and carved the intricate ornaments, which were to be the Temples. Stone after stone, by the combined effort a nd long toil of Appren- tice, Fellow-Craft, and Master, t he walls arose; slowly the roof "},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"was framed and fashi oned; and many year s elapsed before, at length, the Houses stood finished, all fit and ready for the Worship of God, gorgeous in the sunny splendors of the atmosphere of Palestine. So they were built. A single motion of the arm of a rude, barbarous Assyri an Spearman, or drun ken Roman or Gothic Legionary of Titus, moved by a senseless impulse of the brutal will, flung in t he blazing brand; and, with no further human agency, a few short hours sufficed to consume and melt each Tem- ple to a smoking mass of black unsightly ruin. Be patient, therefore, my Brother, and wait! The issues are wi th God: To do, Of right belongs to us. Therefore faint not, nor be w eary in well-doing! Be not dis- couraged at men's apathy, nor dis gusted with their follies, nor tired of their indiff erence! Care not for returns and results;but see only what there is to do, and do it, leav ing the results to God! Soldier of the Cross! Sworn Knight of Just ice, Truth, and Tol- eration! Good Knight an d True!be patient and work! The Apocalypse, that sublime Kabalistic a nd prophetic Sum- mary of all the occult figures, divides its im ages into three Sep- tenaries, after each of which there is sil ence in Heaven. There are Seven Seals to be opened, that is to sa y, Seven mysteries to know, and Seven difficulties to overcome, Se ven trumpets to sound, and Seven cups to empty. The Apocalypse is, to those wh o receive the ni neteenth Degree, the Apothesis of that Sublime Faith which aspires to God alone, and despises all the pomps and wor ks of Lucifer. LUCIFER, the Light - bearer! Strange and mysterious name to give to the Spirit of Darknesss! Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! Is it he who bears the Light, and with its splendors intolera ble blinds feeble, sensual or selfish Souls ? Doubt it not! for traditions are full of Divine Revelations and Inspirations: and In spiration is not of one Age nor of one Creed. Plato and Philo, al so, were inspired. The Apocalypse, indeed, is a bo ok as obscure as the Sohar. It is written hieroglyphica lly with numbers and images; and the Apostle often appeals to the intelligence of the Initiated. \"Let him who hath k nowledge, understand! let him who under- stands, calculate !\" he often says, after an allegory or the mention of a number. Saint John , the favorite Apostle, and the Depositary of all the Secrets of the Saviour, therefor e did not write to be undertood by the multitude. The Sephar Yezirah, the Soha r, and the Apocalypse are the completest embodiments of Occult ism. They contain more mean- ings than words; thei r expressions are figu rative as poetry and exact as numbers. T he Apocalypse sums up , completes, and sur- passes all the Science of Abraham and of So lomon. The visions of Ezekiel, by the river Chebar, and of the new Sy mbolic Temple, are equally mysterious expressions, veiled by figures of the enig- "},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"matic dogmas of the K abalah, and their symbol s are as little un- derstood by the Commentators, as those of Free Masonry. The Septenary is the Crown of the Numbers, because it unites the Triangle of the Idea to the Square of the Form. The more the great Hi erophants were at pain s to conceal their absolute Science, the more they sought to add grandeur to and multiply its symbols. The huge py ramids, with their triangular sides of elevation an d square bases, represented their Metaphysics, founded upon the knowledge of Nature. T hat knowledge of Na- ture had for its symbolic key th e gigantic form of that huge Sphinx, which has hollowed its deep bed in the s and, while keep- ing watch at the feet of the Pyramids. The Seven grand monu- ments called the Wonde rs of the World, were the magnificent Commentaries on the Seven lines that composed the Pyramids, and on the Seven mystic gates of Thebes. The Septenary philosophy of Initiation am ong the Ancients may be summed up thus: Three Absolute Principles whic h are but One Principle: four elementary forms which are bu t one; all forming a Single Whole, compounded of the Idea and the Form. The three Principles were these: 1ø. BEING IS BEING. In Philosophy, identit y of the Idea and of Being or Verity;in Religion, the first Pr inciple, THE FATHER. 2ø. BEING IS REAL. In Philosophy, identit y of Knowing and of Being or Reality; in Religion, the LOGOS of Pl ato, the Demiourgos, the WORD. 3ø. BEING IS LOGIC. In Philosophy, identit y of the Reason and Re ality; in Religion, Providence, the Divine Action t hat makes real the Good, that which in Christianity we call THE HoLY SPIRIT. The union of all the Se ven colors is the White, t he analogous symbol of the GOOD: the absence of all is the Bla ck, the analogous symbol of the EVIL . There are three primar y colors, Red, Yellow, and Blue; and four se condary, Orange, Green , Indigo, and Vio- let; and all these God displays to man in the rainbow; and they have their analogies also in the mo ral and intellectual world. The same number, Seven, continually reappears in the Apocalypse, compounded of thr ee and four; and these nu mbers relate to the last Seven of the Sephiroth, three answering to BENIGNITY or MERCY, SEVERITY or JUSTICE, and BEAUTY or HARMONY; and four to Netzach, Hod, Yesod, and Malakoth, VICTORY, GLORY, STABILITY, and DOMINATION. T he same numbers al so represent the first three Sephiroth, KE TNER, KHOKMAH, and BAINAH, or Will, Wisdom, and Under standing, which, wi th DAATH or Intel- lection or Thought, ar e also four, DAATH not being regarded as a Sephirah, not as the Deity acting, or as a potency, energy, or at- tribute, but as the Divine Action. The Sephiroth are co mmonly figured in the Kabalah as consti- tuting a human form, the ADAM, KADMON Or MACROCOSM. Thus "},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"arranged, the universal law of Equipoise is three times exernpli- fied. From that of the Divine Intellectual, Active, Masculine ENERGY, and the Passive CAPAC ITY to produce Thought, the action of THINKING results. From that of BENIGNITY and SE- VERITY, HARMONY flows; and from that of VICTORY or an Infi- nite overcoming, and GLORY, whic h, being Infinite, would seem to forbid the existence of obstacle s or opposition, results STABILITY or PERMANENCE, which is the perfect DOMINION Of the Infinite WILL. The last nine Sephiroth are incl uded in, at the same time that they have flowed forth from, th e first of all, KETHER, or the CROWN. Each also, in succession flowed from, and yet still re- mains included in, the one precedi ng it. The Will of God includes His Wisdom, and His Wisdom is His Will specially developed and acting. This Wisdom is the LO GOS that creates, mistaken and personified by Simon Magus a nd the succeedi ng Gnostics. By means of its utterance, the letter YOD, it creates the worlds, first in the Divine Intellec t as an Idea, which in vested with form be- came the fabricat ed World, the Universe of material reality. YOD and HE, two letters of the Ineffable Name of the Manifested Deity, represent the Male and the Female, the Active and the Passive in Equilibrium, and t he VAV completes the Trinity and the Triliteral Name, the Divi ne Triangle, which with the repetion of the He beco mes the Tetragrammaton. Thus the ten Sephiroth contain all the Sa cred Numbers, three, five, seven, and nine, and the perfect Number Ten, and correspond with the Tetractys of Pythagoras. BEING IS BEING, Ahay ah Asar Ahayah. This is the principle, the \"BEGINNING.\" In the Beginning was, that is to say, IS, WAS, and WILL BE, the WORD, that is to sa y, the REASON that Speaks. The Word is the reason of belief, and in it also is the expression of the Faith which makes Scienc e a living thing. The Word, is the Source of Logic. Jesu s is the Word Incarnate. The accord of the Reason with Fait h, of Knowledge with Belief, of Authority with Liberty, has become in modern times the veritable enigma of the Sphinx. It is WISDOM that, in the Kaba listic Books of t he Proverbs and Ecclesiasticus, is the Creative A gent of God. El sewhere in the Hebrew writings it is Deba r Iahavah, the Word of God. It is by His uttered Word th at God reveals Himself to us; alone in the visible an d invisible but intell ectual creation, but in our convictions, consciousness, and instincts. H ence it is that! certain beliefs are univ ersal. The conviction of all men that God is good led to a belief in a Devil, the fallen Lu cifer or Light- bearer, Shaitan the Ad versary, Ahriman and Tuphon, as an at- tempt to explain the existence of Evil, and make it consistent with the Infinite Power, Wisdom , and Benevole nce of God. Nothing surpasses and nothing e quals, as a Summary of all the doctrines of the Old World, those brief words engraven by "},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"HERMES on a Stone, and known under the nam e of \"The Tablet of Emerald:\" the Unity of Bei ng and the Unity of the Harmonies, ascending and descending, t he progressive and proportional scale of the Word; the immutabl e law of the Equilibrium, and the proportioned progre ss of the universal an alogies; the relation of the Idea to the Word, giving the measure of the relation be- tween the Creator and the Created, the nec essary mathematics of the Infinite, proved by the measures of a si ngle corner of the Finite ;--all this is expressed by this single pr oposition of the Great Egyptian Hierophant: \"What is Superior is as that which is Inferi or, and what is Below is as that which is Abov e, to form the Marvels of the Unity.\"  XX. GRAND MASTER OF ALL SYMBOLIC LODGES. The true Mason is a practical Ph ilosopher, who, under religious emblems, in all ages adopted by wisdom, builds upon plans traced by nature and reason the moral edifice of knowledge. He ought to find, in the symmetrical relation of all the parts of this rational edifice, the principle a nd rule of all his duti es, the source of all his pleasures. He improves his mo ral nature, becomes a better man, and finds in the reunion of virtuous men, assembled with pure views, the means of multiplying his acts of beneficence. Masonry and Philosophy, wi thout being one and the same thing, have the same object, and propose to themse lves the same end, the worship of the Grand Architect of the Un iverse, acquaintance and familiar- ity with the wonders of natu re, and the happine ss of humanity attained by the constant pr actice of all the virtues. As Grand Master of all Symbolic Lodges, it is y our especial duty to aid in restoring Ma sonry to its primitiv e purity. You have be- come an instructor. Masonry lo ng wandered in e rror. Instead of improving, it degener ated from its primitiv e simplicity, and re- trograded toward a system , distorted by stup idity and ignorance, which, unable to construct a be autiful machine, made a compli- cated one. Less than two hundred ye ars ago, its organization was simple, and altoget her moral, its emblems, allegories, and ceremo- nies easy to be underst ood, and their purpos e and object readily to be seen. It was then c onfined to a very smal l number of Degrees. Its constitutions were like those of a Societ y of Essenes, written in the first century of our era. There could be seen the primitive "},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Christianity, organized into Ma sonry, the school of Pythagoras without incongruities or absurdities; a Mas onry simple and signifi- cant, in which it was not necessary to tortur e the mind to discover reasonable interpretations; a Mas onry at once reli gious and philo- sophical, worthy of a good citi zen and an enli ghtened philanthro- pist. Innovators and inventors overtu rned that primit ive simplicity. Ignorance engaged in the work of making Degrees, and trifles and gewgaws and pretended mysteries, absurd or hideous, usurped the place of Masonic Truth. The pi cture of a horrid vengeance, the poniard and the bloody head, appeared in the peaceful Temple of Masonry, without sufficient expla nation of their symbolic meaning. Oaths out of all propor tion with their objec t, shocked the candi- date, and then became ridiculous, and were wholly disregarded. Acolytes were exposed to tests, and compelled to perform acts, which, if real, would have be en abominable; but being mere chi- meras, were preposterous, and excited contempt and laughter only. Eight hundred Degrees of one ki nd and another were invented: Infidelity and even Jesuitry were taught under the mask of Masonry. The rituals even of the respectable Degr ees, copied and mutilated by ignorant men, becam e nonsensical an d trivial; and the words so corrupted that it has hitherto been found impossible to recover many of them at all. Candidates were made to degrade themselves, and to subm it to insults not to lerable to a man of spirit and honor. Hence it was that, practically, the largest portion of the Degrees claimed by the Ancien t and Accepted Scotti sh Rite, and before it by the Rite of Pe rfection, fell into di suse, were merely com- municated, and their rituals be came jejune and insignificant. These Rites resembled those old pal aces and baronial castles, the different parts of whic h, built at differen t periods remote from one another, upon plans and according to ta stes that greatly varied, formed a discord ant and incongruous whole. Judaism and chivalry, superstition and phi losophy, philanthropy and insane hatred and longing for vengeance, a pure mora lity and unjust and illegal revenge, were found strangely mated and standing hand in hand within the Temples of Peac e and Concord; and the whole system was one grotesque commi ngling of incongruous things, of contrasts and contradictions, of shocking and fa ntastic extrava- gances, of parts repugna nt to good taste, and fine conceptions overlaid and disfigured by absur dities engendered by ignorance, fanaticism, and a senseless mysticism. An empty and sterile pomp, impossible indee d to be carried out, and to which no meaning whatever was attached, with far-fetched explanations that were either so many stupid plat itudes or them- selves needed an interpreter; loft y titles, arbitrar ily assumed, and to which the inventor s had not condescended to attach any expla- nation that should acqui t them of the folly of assuming temporal rank, power, and titles of nobility, made the world laugh, and the Initiate feel ashamed. "},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Some of these titles we retain ;but they have with us meanings entirely consistent with that Spirit of Equal ity which is the foun- dation and peremptory law of it s being of all Masonry. The Knight, with us, is he who devotes his hand, his heart, his brain, to the Science of Masonry, and professes himself the Sworn Soldier of Truth: t he Prince is he who aims to be Chief [Prin- ceps], first, leader , among his equals, in virtue and good deeds: the Sovereign is he who, one of an order whose members are all Sovereigns, is Supreme only because the law and co nstitutions are so, which he ad ministers, and by whic h he, like every other brother, is governed. The titles , Puissant, Potent, Wise, and Ven- erable, indicate that power of Virtue, Intelligen ce, and Wisdom, which those ought to stri ve to attain who are placed in high office by the suffrages of their brethr en: and all our other titles and designations have an esoteric m eaning, consistent with modesty and equality, and which those who receive them sh ould fully un- derstand. As Master of a Lodge it is your duty to instruct your Brethren that they ar e all so many constant lessons, teaching the lofty qualifications which are required of those who cl aim them, and not merely idle gewgaws worn in ridiculous imitation of the times when the Nobles and Priests were ma sters and the people slaves: and that, in a ll true Masonry, the Kn ight, the P ontiff, the Prince, and the Sovereig n are but the first am ong their equals: and the cordon, the clothi ng, and the jewel but symbols and emblems of the virtues requir ed of all good Masons. The Mason kneels, no longer to present his petition for ad- mittance or to receive the answer, no longer to a man as his su- perior, who is but his brother, but to his God;to whom he appeals for the rectitude of his intentions , and whose aid he asks to enable him to keep his vows. No one is degraded by be nding his knee to God at the altar, or to receive the honor of Knighthood as Bayard and Du Guesclin knelt. To knee l for other purp oses, Masonry does not require. God ga ve to man a head to be borne erect, a port upright and majestic. We assemble in our Temples to cherish and inculcate sentiments that confo rm to that loftiness of bearing which the just and upright man is entitled to maintain, and we do not require those who desire to be admitted among us, ignomini- ously to bow the head. We respect man, because we respect our- selves that he may conceive a lo fty idea of his dignity as a human being free and i ndependent. If modesty is a virtue, humility and obsequiousness to man are base: fo r there is a n oble pride which is the most real and solid basis of virtue. Man should humble him- self before the Infi nite God; but not bef ore his erring and imper- fect brother. As Master of a Lodge, you will therefore be e xceedingly careful that no Candidate, in any Degree , be required to submit to any degradation whatever; as has been too much the custom in some of the Degrees:and take it as a certain and inflexible rule, to which there is no exc eption, that real Maso nry requires of no man anything to which a Knight and G entleman cannot honorably, and "},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"without feeling ou traged or humil iated submit. The Supreme Council for the S outhern Jurisdiction of the United States at le ngth undertook the i ndispensable and long-de- layed task of revising and reforming the work and rituals of the Thirty Degrees under its jurisdic tion. Retaining th e essentials of the Degrees and all t he means by which the members recognize one another, it has sought out and developed the leading idea of each Degree, rejected the puer ilities and absurditi es with which many of them were disfigured, and m ade of them a connected system of moral, religious, and philosophical instruction. Sectarian of no creed, it has yet thou ght it not improper to use the old allegories, based on occurrences detailed in the Hebrew and Christian books, and drawn from the Ancient Myst eries of Egypt, Persia, Greece, India, the Druids and the Essenes, as vehicles to communicate the Great Masonic Truths; as it has used the legends of the Crusades, and the ceremonies of th e orders of Knighthood. It no longer inculcates a cr iminal and wicke d vengeance. It has not allowed Masonry to play the assassin: to avenge the death either of Hiram, of Charles the 1st, or of Jaques De Molay and the Templars. The Ancient and A ccepted Scottish Rite of Ma- sonry has now become, what Masonr y at first was meant to be, a Teacher of Great Truths, inspir ed by an upright and enlightened reason, a firm and constant wi sdom, and an affectionate and lib- eral philanthropy. It is no longer a system, over the compos ition and arrangement of the different parts of which, want of reflecti on, chance, igno- rance, and perhaps motives stil l more ignoble presided; a system unsuited to our habits, our manners, our idea s, or the world-wide philanthropy and universal tolera tion of Masonr y; or to bodies small in number, whos e revenues should be devoted to the relief of the unfortunate, and not to empty show; no longer a hetero- geneous aggregate of Degrees, s hocking by its anachronisms and contradictions, powerless to disseminate light, information, and moral and philo sophical ideas. As Master, you will teach those who are under you, and to whom you will owe your office , that the decorations of many of the De- grees are to be dispens ed with, whenever the expense would inter- fere with the dut ies of charity, relief, and benevol ence; and to be indulged in only by w ealthy bodies that wi ll thereby do no wrong to those entitled to their assistan ce. The essentials of all the De- grees may be procured at slight expense; and it is at the option of every Brother to procure or not to procure, as he pleases, the dress, decorations, and jewels of any Degree other than the 14th, 18th, 30th, and 32d. We teach the truth of none of the legends we reci te. They are to us but parables and allego ries, involving and enveloping Masonic instruction; and vehicles of usef ul and interesting in- formation. They represent the different phases of the human mind, its effort s and struggles to comp rehend nature , God, the government of the Universe, the permitted existence of sorrow "},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"and evil. To teach us wisdom, and the folly of e ndeavoring to ex- plain to ourselves that which we are not cap able of understanding, we reproduce the speculations of the Philosophers, the Kabalists, the Mystagogues and the Gnostics. Every one being at liberty to apply our symbols and emblems as he thinks most consistent with truth and reason and with his own faith, we give them such an in- terpretation only as may be acce pted by all. Our Degrees may be conferred in France or Turkey, at Pekin, Ispahan , Rome, or Ge- neva, in the city of Pe nn or in Catholic Louisi ana, upon the subject of an absolute governme nt or the citizen of a Free State, upon Sec- tarian or Theist. To honor the De ity, to regard all men as our Brethren, as children, equally dear to Him, of the Supreme Creator of the Universe, and to make hims elf useful to so ciety and himself by his labor, are its teachings to its Initiates in all the Degrees. Preacher of Liberty, Fr aternity, and Equality, it desires them to be attained by making men fit to receive t hem, and by the moral power of an intellig ent and enlightened Peop le. It lays no plots and conspiracies. It hatches no pr emature revolutions; it encour- ages no people to revolt against t he constituted authorities; but recognizing the gr eat truth that freedom fo llows fitness for free- dom as the corollary follows the ax iom, it strives to prepare men to govern themselves. Where domestic slavery exists, it teaches the master humanity and the alleviation of the conditio n of his slave, and moderate cor- rection and gentle di scipline; as it teaches them to the master of the apprentice: and as it teaches to the employer s of other men, in mines, manufactories, and wo rkshops, consideration and hu- manity for those who depend upon their labor fo r their bread, and to whom want of empl oyment is starvation, and overwork is fever, consumption, and death. As Master of a Lodge, you are to inculcate thes e duties on your brethren. Teach the employed to be honest, punctual, and faithful as well as respectful and obedient to all proper orders: but also teach the employer that every ma n or woman who desires to work, has a right to have work to do; and that they, an d those who from sickness or feebleness, lo ss of limb or of bodi ly vigor, old age or infancy, are not able to work, have a right to be f ed, clothed, and sheltered from the in clement elements: that he commits an awful sin against Masonry and in the sight of God, if he closes his work- shops or factories, or ceases to work his mines, when they do not yield him what he regards as sufficient profit , and so dismisses his workmen and workwomen to starve; or when he r educes the wages of man or woman to so low a st andard that they and their families cannot be clothed and fed and comfor tably housed; or by overwork must give him their blood and life in exch ange for the pittance of their wages: and that his duty as a Mason and Brother per- emptorily requires him to continue to employ those who else will be pinched with hunge r and cold, or resort to theft and vice: and to pay them fair wa ges, though it may reduc e or annul his profits or even eat into hi s capital; for God hat h but loaned him his "},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"wealth, and made hi m His almoner and a gent to invest it. Except as mere symbols of the moral virtues and intellectual qualities, the tools and implements of Masonr y belong exclusively to the first three De grees. They also, howev er, serve to remind the Mason who has advanced further, that his new rank is based upon the humble labo rs of the symbolic Degr ees, as they are im- properly termed, i nasmuch as all the Degrees are symbolic. Thus the Initiates are inspired wi th a just idea of Masonry, to- wit, that it is essentially WORK ; both teaching and practising LABOR; and that it is altogether emblematic . Three kinds of work are necessary to the preservation and protection of man and soci- ety: manual labor, spec ially belonging to th e three blue Degrees; labor in arms, symboliz ed by the Knightly or chivalric Degrees; and intellectual labor, belonging pa rticularly to the Philosophical Degrees. We have preserved and multiplied such em blems as have a true and profound meaning. We reject many of the old and senseless explanations. We have not reduced Masonry to a cold metaphy- sics that exiles ever ything belonging to the do main of the imagina- tion. The ignora nt, and those half-wise in reality, but over-wise in their own conceit, may assail our symbols with sarcasms; but they are nevertheless ingenious veil s that cover the Truth, respect- ed by all who know t he means by which the heart of man is reach- ed and his feelings enli sted. The Great Mora lists often had re- course to allegories, in order to instruct men wi thout repelling them. But we have been careful not to allow our emblems to be too obscure, so as to require far-fetched a nd forced interpreta- tions. In our days, and in the enlightened land in which we live, we do not need to wrap ourselves in veils so strange and impene- trable, as to prevent or hinder instruction in stead of furthering it; or to induce the susp icion that we have c oncealed meanings which we communicate only to the most reliable adepts, be cause they are contrary to good order or the well-being of society. The Duties of the Cla ss of Instructors, th at is, the Masons of the Degrees from the 4th to the 8th, inclusive, are, particularly, to perfect the younge r Masons in t he words, signs and tokens and other work of the Degr ees they have received; to explain to them the meaning of the different embl ems, and to ex pound the moral instruction which they convey. And upon their report of pro- ficiency alone can thei r pupils be allowed to advance and receive an increase of wages. The Directors of the Work, or t hose of the 9th, l0th, and 11th Degrees are to r eport to the Chap ters upon the regul arity, activity and proper direction of the work of bodies in the lower Degrees, and what is needed to be enacted for their pr osperity and useful- ness. In the Symbolic Lodges, t hey are particula rly charged to stimulate the zeal of the workmen, to induc e them to engage in new labors and enter prises for the good of Masonry, their country and mankind, and to gi ve them fraternal ad vice when they fall short of their duty; or , in cases that requir e it, to invoke against "},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"them the rigor of Masonic law. The Architects, or those of the 12th, 13th, and 14th, should be selected from none but Brothers well instru cted in the preceding Degrees; zealous, and capable of discoursing upon that Masonry; illustrating it, and di scussing the simple ques tions of moral phil- osophy. And one of t hem, at every communica tion, should be pre- pared with a lecture, communicating useful knowledge or giving good advice to the Brethren. The Knights, of the 15th and 16th Degree s, wear the sword. They are bound to pr event and repair, as fa r as may be in their power, all injustice, both in the world and in Maso nry; to protect the weak and to bring oppressors to justice. Their works and lec- tures must be in this spirit. They should i nquire whether Masonry fulfills, as far as it ought and ca n, its principal purpose, which is to succor the unfortunate. That it may do so, they should pre- pare propositions to be offer ed in the Blue Lodges calculated to attain that end, to pu t an end to abuses, and to prevent or correct negligence. Those in t he Lodges who have at tained the rank of Knights, are most fit to be appointed Almoners, and charged to ascertain and make known who need and are entitled to the charity of the Order. In the higher Degr ees those only should be received who have sufficient reading and information to discuss the great questions of philosophy. From them the Orators of the Lodges should be selected, as well as those of t he Councils and Chapt ers. They are charged to suggest such measures as are necessary to make Ma- sonry entirely faithf ul to the spirit of its in stitution, both as to its charitable purposes, and the diffu sion of light and knowledge; such as are needed to correct abu ses that have crept in, and of- fences against the rule s and general spirit of the Order; and such as will tend to make i t, as it was meant to be, the great Teacher of Mankind. As Master of a Lodge, Council, or Chapter, it will be your duty to impress upon the minds of your Brethren these views of the general plan and separat e parts of the Ancien t and Accepted Scot- tish Rite; of its spirit and desi gn; its harmony and regularity; of the duties of the o fficers and members;and of the particular les- sons intended to be ta ught by each Degree. Especially you are not to allow any assembly of the body over which you may preside, to close, without recalling to the minds of the Brethren the Masoni c virtues and duties which are represented upon the Tracing Board of this Degree. That is an imperative duty. Forget not that, more than three thous and years ago, ZORO- ASTER said:\"Be good, be kind, be humane, and charitable; love your fellows; console the afflic ted; pardon thos e who have done you wrong.\" Nor that more t han two thousand three hundred years ago CONFUCIUS repeated, al so quoting the language of those who had lived before himself: \"L ove thy neighbor as thyself: Do not to others what thou wouldst no t wish should be done to thy- self: Forgive injuries. Forgive yo ur enemy, be reconciled to him, "},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"give him assistance, in voke God in his behalf!\" Let not the morality of your Lodge be inferi or to that of the Persian or the Ch inese Philosopher. Urge upon your Brethr en the teaching and the unostentatious practice of the morality of t he Lodge, without re gard to times, places, religions, or peoples. Urge them to love one another, to be devo ted to one another, to be faithful to the country, t he government, and the laws: for to serve the country is to pa y a dear and sacred debt: To respect all forms of worship, to tolera te all political and religious opinions; not to blam e, and still less to condemn the religion of others: not to seek to make converts; but to be content if they have the religion of Socr ates; a veneration for the Creator, the religion of good wo rks, and grateful a cknowledgment of God's blessings: To fraternize with all men; to assist all who are unfortunate; and to cheerfully po stpone their own interests to that of the Order: To make it the constant rule of their lives, to think well, to speak well, and to act well: To place the sage above the sold ier, the noble, or the prince: and take the wise and good as their models: To see that their pr ofessions and practice , their teachings and conduct, do always agree: To make this also their mo tto: Do that wh ich thou oughtest to do; let the result be what it will. Such, my Brother, are some of t he duties of that office which you have sought to be qualified to exerci se. May you perform them well; and in so doing gain honor for yourself, and advance the great cause of Masonr y, Humanity, and Progress.  XXI. NOACHITE, OR PRUSSIAN KNIGHT. You are especially charged in this Degree to be modest and humble, and not vain-glo rious nor filled with self-conceit. Be not wiser in your own opinion than t he Deity, nor find fault with His works, nor endeavor to improve upon what He has done. Be modest also in your intercourse with your fell ows, and slow to entertain evil thoughts of them, and reluctan t to ascribe to them evil intentions. A t housand presses, flo oding the country with their evanescent leaves, are bu sily and incessantly engaged in maligning the motives and conduc t of men and parties, and in "},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"making one man think wo rse of another; while, alas, scarcely one is found that ever, even accidental ly, labors to make man think better of his fellow. Slander and calumny were never so insolently licentious in any country as they are this day in our s. The most reti ring disposition, the most unobtrusive demeanor, is no shield against their poison- ed arrows. The most eminent pul blic service only makes their vituperation and inve ctive more eager an d more unscrupulous, when he who has done such servic e presents himself as a candi- date for the people's suffrages. The evil is wide-spr ead and universal. No man, no woman, no household, is sacred or safe from this new Inquisition. No act is so pure or so praise worthy, that the unscr upulous vender of lies who lives by pandering to a corr upt and morbid public appetite will not proclaim it as a crime. No motive is so innocent or so laudable, that he will not hold it up as villainy. Journalism pries into the interior of private house s, gloats over t he details of do- mestic tragedies of sin and shame, and deliberately invents and industriously circulates the most unmitigated and baseless false- hoods, to coin money for those who pursue it as a trade, or to effect a temporary result in the wars of faction. We need not enla rge upon these evils. T hey are appar ent to all and lamented over by al l, and it is the duty of a Mason to do all in his power to lessen, if not to remove them. With the errors and even sins of other men, that do not personally affect us or ours, and need not our condemnation to be odio us, we have noth- ing to do; and the journalist ha s no patent that makes him the Censor of Morals. There is no ob ligation resting on us to trumpet forth our disapproval of every wrongful or injudicious or im- proper act that ever y other man commits. One would be ashamed to stand on the street co rners and retail them orally for pennies. One ought, in truth, to write, or speak against no other one in this world. Each man in it has enough to do, to watch and keep guard over himself. Each of us is sick enough in this great Lazaretto: and j ournalism and polemical wr iting constantly re- mind us of a scene once witness ed in a little hospital; where it was horrible to hear how the patients mocki ngly reproached each other with their diso rders and infirmities: how one, who was wasted by consumption, jeered at another who was bloated by dropsy: how one laughed at another's cancer of the face; and this one again at his neighbor's lock-jaw or squint; until at last the delirious fever-pat ient sprang out of hi s bed, and tore away the coverings from the woun ded bodies of his companions, and nothing was to be se en but hideous misery and mutilation. Such is the revolting work in whic h journalism and political partisan- ship, and half the wo rld outside of Masonry, are engaged. Very generally, the censure best owed upon men's acts, by those who have appointed and commissioned themse lves Keepers of the Public Morals, is undeserved. Of ten it is not only undeserved, but praise is deserved instead of censure, and, when the latter "},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"is not undeserved, it is alwa ys extravagant, a nd therefore un- just. A Mason will wonder what spirit they are endowed withal, that can basely libel at a m an, even, that is fa llen. If they had any nobility of soul, they would with him condol e his disasters, and drop some tears in pi ty of his folly and wr etchedness: and if they were merely human and not brutal , Nature did gr ievous wrong to human bodies, to curse them with souls so cruel as to strive to add to a wretchedness already into lerable. When a Mason hears of any man that hath fallen into publ ic disgrace, he should have a mind to commiserate his mishap, and not to make him more dis- consolate. To envenom a name by libels, th at already is openly tainted, is to add stri pes with an iron rod to one that is flayed with whipping; and to ever y well-tempered mind will seem most in- human and unmanly. Even the man who does wrong and commits errors often has a quiet home, a fireside of his own, a gentle, lo ving wife and inno- cent children, who perhaps do no t know of his past errors and lapses--past and long r epented of; or if they do, they love him the better, because, being mortal , he hath erred, and being in the image of God, he hath re pented. That every bl ow at this husband and father lacerate s the pure and t ender bosoms of that wife and those daughters, is a consideration t hat doth not st ay the hand of the brutal journalist a nd partisan: but he st rikes home at these shrinking, quivering, innocent, tender bosoms; and then goes out upon the great arteries of cities, where the curr ent of life pulsates, and holds his head erect, and calls on his fellows to laud him and admire him, for the chivalric act he hath done, in striking his dagger through o ne heart into another tender and trusting one. If you seek for high and strained carriages , you shall, for the most part, meet with them in low men. Arrogance is a weed that ever grows on a dunghill. It is from the rank ness of that soil that she hath her height and spreadings. To be modest and unaffected with our superiors is duty; with our equals, courtesy; with our in- feriors, nobleness. There is no arrogance so great as the pro- claiming of othe r men's errors and faults , by those who under- stand nothing but the dregs of actions, and who make it their business to besmear dese rving fames. Public re proof is like strik- ing a deer in the herd: it not only wounds him, to the loss of blood, but betrays him to the hound, his enemy. The occupation of the spy hath ever been held dishonorable, and it is none the less so, now that with rare exceptions editors and partisans have become perpet ual spies upon the actions of ocher men. Their malice makes th em nimble-eyed, apt to note a fault and publish it, and, with a strained construction, to deprave even those things in which the doer's intents were honest. Like the crocodile, they sl ime the way of others, to make them fall; and when that has happen ed, they feed their insulting envy on the life-blood of the pros trate. They set the vices of other men on "},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"high, for the gaze of the world, and place their virtues under- ground, that none may note th em. If they cannot wound upon proofs, they will do it upon like lihoods: and if not upon them, they manufacture lies, as God created the world, out of nothing; and so corrupt the fair tempter of men's reputatio ns; knowing that the multitude will belie ve them, because affi rmations are apter to win belief, th an negatives to uncr edit them; and th at a lie travels faster than an eagle fl ies, while the contradi ction limps after it at a snail's pace, and, hal ting, never overtakes it. Nay, it is con- trary to the morality of journali sm, to allow a li e to be contra- dicted in the plac e that spawned it. And ev en if that great favor is conceded, a slander once raised will scarce ev er die, or fail of finding many that will allow it both a harbor and trust. This is, beyond any other, the age of falsehood. Once, to be suspected of equivocation was eno ugh to soil a ge ntleman's escut- cheon; but now it has become a strange merit in a partisan or statesman, always and scrupulously to tell the truth. Lies are part of the regular ammunition of all campaigns and controversies, valued according as they are pr ofitable and effe ctive; and are stored up and have a ma rket price, like sa ltpetre an d sulphur; being even more d eadly than they. If men weighed the imperfections of humanity, they would breathe less condemnation. Ig norance gives disparagement a louder tongue than knowledge does. Wise men had rather know, than tell. Frequent dispraises ar e but the faults of uncharitable wit: and it is from where there is no judgment, t hat the heaviest judgment comes; for self-exami nation would make all judgments charitable. If we even do know vices in men, we can scarce show ourselves in a nobler virtue than in the char ity of concealing them: if that be not a flattery persuading to c ontinuance. And it is the basest office man can fall into, to make his tongue the de- famer of the worthy man. There is but one rule for the Mason in this matter. If there be virtues, and he is ca lled upon to speak of hi m who owns them, let him tell them forth im partially. And if ther e be vices mixed with them, let him be content the worl d shall know them by some other tongue than his. For if the evil-doer deserve no pity, his wife, his parents, or his children, or other innocent persons who love him may; and the bravo's trade, prac tised by him who stabs the de- fenceless for a price paid by indivi dual or party, is really no more respectable now than it was a hundred years ago, in Venice. Where we want experi ence, Charity bids us think the best, and leave what we know not to the S earcher of Hearts; for mistakes, suspicions, and envy often injure a clear fame; and there is least danger in a charitab le construction. And, finally, the Mason should be humble and modest toward the Grand Architect of the Un iverse, and not impugn His Wis- dom, nor set up his ow n imperfect sense of Right against His Providence and dispensations, nor attempt too rashly to explore the Mysteries of God's Infinite Essence and inscr utable plans, and "},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"of that Great Nature which we are not ma de capable to under- stand. Let him steer far away from all those vain philosophies, which endeavor to account for all that is , without admittin g that there is a God, separate and apar t from the Universe which is his work: which erect Universal Nature into a God, and wo rship it alone: which annihilate Spirit, and believe no testimony except that of the bodily senses:which, by logica l formulas and dextrous colloca- tion of words, make the actual, li ving, guiding, and protecting God fade into the dim mistiness of a mere abstract ion and unreality, itself a mere logical formula. Nor let him have any al liance with those t heorists who chide the delays of Providence and busy th emselves to hasten the slow march which it has imposed upon events: who neglect the practi- cal, to struggle after impossibi lities: who are wiser than Heaven; know the aims and purposes of the Deity, and ca n see a short and more direct means of attaining them, than it plea ses Him to em- ploy: who would have no discords in the great harmony of the Universe of things; but equal dist ribution of propert y, no subjec- tion of one man to the will of another, no compulsory labor, and still no starvation, nor de stitution, nor pauperism. Let him not spend his life, as they do, in building a new Tower of Babel; in attempti ng to change that whic h is fixed by an in- flexible law of God's enactment: but let him, yi elding to the Superior Wisdom of Providence, content to believe that the march of events is rightly ordered by an Infinite Wi sdom, and leads, though we cannot see it, to a great and pe rfect result,--let him be satisfied to follow the path po inted out by that Providence, and to labor for the good of the human race in that mode in which God has chosen to enact that that good shall be effected: and above all, let him build no Tower of Babel, under the belief that by ascending he will mount so hi gh that God will disappear or be superseded by a great monstrous aggr egate of material forces, or mere glittering, logical formula; but, evermore, standing humbly and reverently upon t he earth and looking with awe and confi- dence toward Heaven , let him be satisfied that there is a real God; a person, and not a formula; a Fa ther and a protector, who loves, and sympathizes, and co mpassionates; and th at the eternal ways by which He rules the world are infinitely wise , no matter how far they may be above the feeble comprehension and limited vision of man.  XXII. KNIGHT OF THE ROYAL AXE OR "},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"PRINCE OF LIBANUS. SYMPATHY with the great l aboring classes, respect for labor itself, and resolution to do some good work in our day and generati on, these are the lessons of this Degree, and they are purely Masoni c. Masonry has made a working-man and his associat es the Heroes of her prin cipal legend, and himself the companion of Kings. The idea is as si mple and true as it is sublime. From first to last, Masonry is work. It venerates the Grand Arckitrct of the Universe. It commemorates the building of a Temple. Its principal emblems are the working fools of Masons and Artisans. It preserve s the name of the first worker in brass and iron as one of its pass-words . When the Brethren meet together, they are at labor. The Master is the overseer w ho sets the craft to work and gives them proper instruction. Masonry is the apotheosi s of Work. It is the hands of brave, forgotten men that have m ade this great, populous, cultivated world a world for us. It is all work, and forgotten work. The real conquerors, creators, and et ernal proprietors of ever y great and civilized land are all the heroic souls that ever were in it, each in his degree: all the men that ever felled a forest -tree or drained a marsh, or contrived a wise scheme, or did or said a true or valiant thing therein. Genuine work alone, done faithfully, is eternal, even as the Al mighty Founder and Worl d-builder Himself. All work is noble: a life of ease is not for any m an, nor for any God. The Almighty Maker is not like one who, in old immemorial ages, having made his machine of a Universe, sits ever since, and sees it go. Out of that belief comes Atheism. The faith in an Invisible, unnamable, Directing Deity, present everywhere in all that we see, and work, and suffer , is the essence of all faith whatsoever. The life of all Gods figures itself to us as a Sublime Earnest ness,-of Infinite battle against Infinite labor Our highest religion is named the Worship of Sorrow. For the Son of Man there is no noble crown, well-worn, or even ill-worn, but is a crown of thorns. Man's hi ghest destiny is not to be happy, to love pleasant th ings and find them . His only true unhappiness should be that he cannot work, and get his destiny as a man fulfilled. The day passes swiftly over, our life passes swiftly over, and the night cometh, wherein no man can work. That nigh ts once come, our happin ess and unhappiness are vanished, and become as things that never were. But our work is not abolished, and has not vanished. It rema ins, or the want of it remains, for endless Times and Eternities. Whatsoever of morality and intelligence ; what of patience, perseverance, faithfulness, of method, insight, ingenuity, energy; in a word, whatsoever of STRENGTH a man has in him, will lie written in t he WORK he does. To work is to try himself against Nature and her unerri ng, everlasting laws : and they will return true verdict as to him. The noblest Epic is a mighty Empire slowly built together, a mighty seri es of heroic deeds, a might y conquest over chaos. Deeds are greater than words. Th ey have a life, mute, but undeniably ; and grow. They people the vacuity of Time, and make it green and worthy. Labor is the truest emblem of God, the Architect and Eternal Ma ker; noble Labor, which is yet to be the King of this Eart h, and sit on the highest Throne. Men without duties to do, are like trees planted on precipices ; from "},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"the roots of which all the earth has crumbled. Nature owns no man who is not also a Martyr. She scorns the man who si ts screened from all work, from want, danger, hardship, the victor y over which is work ; and has all his work and battling done by other men; and yet there are men w ho pride themselves that they and theirs have done no work time out of mind. So neither ha ve the swine. The chief of men is he w ho stands in the van of men, fronting the peril which frightens back all others, and if not vanquished w ould devour them. Hercules was worshipped for twelve labors. The Czar of Russia became a toiling shipwright, and worked with his axe in the docks of Saardam ; and something came of that. Cromwell worked, and Napoleon; and effe cted somewhat. There is a perennial noble ness and even sacredness in work. Be he never so benighted and forgetfu l of his high ca lling, there is always hope in a man who actually and earnes tly works : in Idleness al one is there perpetual Despair. Man perfects himself by wo rking. Jungles ar e cleared away. Fair seed-fields rise instead, and stately cities ; an d withal, the man himself first ceases to be a foul unwholesome jungle and dese rt thereby. Even in the meanest sort of labor , the whole soul of man is composed into a kind of real harmony, the moment he begins to wo rk. Doubt, Desire, Sorrow, Remorse, Indignation, and even De spair shrink murmuring fa r off into their caves, whenever the man bends hims elf resolutely against his task. Labor is life. From the inmost heart of the wo rker rises his God-given Fo rce, the Sacred Celestial life essence, breathed into him by Al mighty God ; and awakens him to all nobleness, as soon as work fitly begins. By it man learns Patience, Courage, Perseverance, Openness to light, readiness to own hims elf mistaken, resolution to do better and impr ove. Only by labor will man continually lear n the virtues. There is no Religion in stagnation and inaction; bu t only in activity and exertion. There was the d eepest truth in that saying of the old monks, \"laborare est orare.\" \"He prayeth best who liveth bes t all things both great and small;\" and can man love except by working earnestly to benefit that being whom he loves? \"Work; and therein have well-being,\" is the oldest of Go spels; unpreached, inarticulate, but ineradic able, and enduring foreve r. To make Disorder, wherever found, an eternal enemy; to at tack and subdue him, and make order of him, the subject not of Chaos, but of Intelligence and Divinity, and of ourselves ; to attack ignorance, st upidity and brute-mi ndedness, wherever found, to smite it wisely and unweariedly, to rest not while we live and it lives in the name of God, this is our duty as Masons; commanded us by the Highest God. Even He, with his unspoken voice, more awful than the thunders of Sinai, or the syllabled spee ch of the Hurricane, spea ks to us. The Unborn Ages ; the old Graves, with their long-mo ldering dust speak to us. The deep Death-Kingdoms, the Stars in their never-resting course, all Space and all Time, silently and continual ly admonish us that we too must work whore it is called to-day. Labor, wide as the Earth, has its su mmit in Heaven. To toil, whether with the swea t of the brow, or of the brain or he art, is worship,-the noblest thing yet discovered beneath the Stars. Let the weary cease to think that labor is a curse and doom pronounced by Deity. Without it there could be no true excellence in human nature . Without it, and pain, and sorrow, where would be the human virtues? Where Patience, Perseverance, Submission, Energy, Endurance, Fortitude, Bravery, Disinterestedness, Se lf-Sacrifice, the noblest excellencies of the Soul? "},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Let him who toils co mplain not, nor feel humili ated ! Let him. look up, and see his fellow-workmen there, in God' s Eternity, they alone surviving there. Even in the weak human memo ry they long survive, as Saints, as Heroes, and as Gods : they alone surviv e, and people th e unmeasured solitudes of Time. To the primeval man, what soever good came, descended on him (as in mere fact, it ever does) direct from God; whatsoever duty la y visible for him, this a Supreme God had pre scribed. For the primeval man, in whom dwelt Thought, this Universe was all a Temple , life everywhere a Worship. Duty is with us ever; and evermore forbids us to be idle. To work with the hands or brain, according to our requirements and our capacities, to do that which lies before us to do, is more honorable than rank and title. Ploughers, spinners and builders, inve ntors, and men of science , poets, advocates, and writers, all stand upon one common level, and form on grand, innumerable host, marching ever onward since the beginning of the world : each en titled to our sympathy and respect, eac h a man and our brother. It was well to give the earth to man as a dark mass, whereon to labor. It was well to provide ru de and uprightly materials in t he ore-bed and t he forest, for him to fashion into sple ndor and beauty. It was we ll, not because of that splendor and beauty ; but because the act creatin g them is bet ter than the things themselves; because exertion is nobler than enjoy ment; because the laborer is greater and more worthy of honor than t he idler. Masonry stands up for the nobility of labor. It is Heaven's great or dinance for human improvement.. It has been br oken down for ages ; and Masonry desires to build it up again. It has bean broken down, because men toil only because ihey must, submitting to it as, in some sort, a degrading necessity; and desiring nothing so much on earth as to escape from it. They fulfill the gr eat law of labor in the letter, but break it in the spirit: they fulfill it with the muscles, but break it with the mind. Masonry teaches that every idler ought to hasten to some field of labor, manual or mental, as a chosen and cove ted theatre of impr ovement ; but he is not impelled to do so, under the teac hings of an imperfect civilization. On the contrary, he sits down, fold s his hands, and bl esses and glorifies himself in his idleness. It is time that this o pprobrium of toil were done away. To be ashamed of to il; of the dingy workshop and dusty labor-field; of the hard hand, stai ned with service more honorable than that of war; of the soiled and weather-stai ned garments, on which Mother Nature has stamped, midst sun and rain, midst fire and steam, her own heraldic honors; to be ashamed of these tokens and titles, and envious of the flaunting robes of imbecile idleness and vanity, is treason to Na ture, impiety to He aven, a breach of Heaven's great Ordinance. Toil,) of brain, heart, or hand, is the only true manhood and genu ine nobility. Labor is a more benef icent ministration than man's ignoranc e comprehends, or his complaining will admit. Even when its end is hi dden from him, it is not mere blind drudgery, It is all a tr aining, a discipline, a development of energies, a nurse of virtues, a school bf improvement. From the poor boy who gathers a few sticks for his mother's hearth, to the strong man w ho fells the oak or guides the ship or the steam-car, every human toiler, with every weary step and every urgent task, is obeying a wisdom far above his own wisdom, and fulfilling a design far beyond his own design. The great law of human indu stry is this : that indu stry, working either with "},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"the hand or the mind , the applicat ion of our powers to some task, to the achievement of some result , lies at the found ation of all huma n improvement. We are not sent into the worl d like animals, to crop the spontaneous herbage of the field, and then to lie down in indolent repose: but we ar e sent to dig the soil and plough the sea; to do the business of cities and the world of manufactories. The world is the great and appointed school of industry. In an artificial state of societ y, mankind is divided into the idle and the laboring classes; but such was not the design of Providence. Labor is man's great functi on, his peculiar distin ction and his privilege. From being an animal, that eats and drinks and sleeps only, to become a worker, and with the hand of ingenuity to pour his own thoughts into the moulds of Nature, fashioning ttorn into forms of grace and fabr ics of convenience, and converting them to purposes of impr ovement and happiness, is the greatest possible step in privilege. The Earth and the Atmo sphere are man's labora tory. With spade and plough, with mining-s hafts and furnaces and forges, with fire and steam ; midst the noise and whirl of sw ift and bright machinery, and abroad in the silent fields, man was made to be ever worki ng, ever experimentin g. And while he and all his dwellings of care and toil are borne onward with the circling skies, and the splendour of H eaven are around him, and t heir infinite depths image and invite his thought, still in all the worlds of philo sophy, in the universe of intellect, man must be a worker. He is nothing, he can be nothing, can achieve nothing, fulfill nothing, wi thout working. Without it, he can gain neither lofty improvement nor toler able happiness. The idle mu st hunt down the hours as their prey. To them Time is an enemy, clot hed with armor; a nd they must kill him, or :themselves die. It never yet did answer, and it never will answer for any man to do nothing, to be exempt from all care and effort to lounge, to walk, to ride, and to feast alone. No m an can live in that way. God made a law against it : which no human power c an annul, no human ingenuity evade. The idea that a property is to be acqu ired in the course of ten or twenty years, which shall suffic e for the rest of life; that by some prosperous traffic or grand specul ation, all the labor of a whole life is to be accomplished in a brief po rtion of it; that by de xterous management, a large part of the term of human existence is to be exonerated from the cares of industry and self- denial, is f ounded upon a grave mistake, upon a misconception of the true nature and design of business, and of the conditions of human well being. The de sire of accumulation for the sake of securing a life of ease and gratification, of escaping from exertion and self-denial, is wholly wrong, though very common. It is better for the Mason to live whil e he lives, and enjoy life as it passes to live richer and die poor er. It is best of all for him to banish from the mind that empty drea m of future indole nce and indulgent ; to address himself to the business of life, as th e school of his eart hly education; to settle it with himself now that in dependence, if he gains it, is not to give him exemption from employment It is best for him to know, that, in order to be a happy man, he must always be a laborer, with the mind or the body, or wi th both: and that the reasonable exertion of hi s powers, bodily and mental , is not to be regarded as mere drudgery, but as a good discipline, a wise ordination, a training in this primary school of ou r being, for nobler endeavor s, and spheres of higher activity hereafter "},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":" There are reasons why a Mason may la wfully and even earnestly desire a fortune. If he can fill some fine palace, itself a wo rk of art, with the productions of lofty g enius; if he can be the fr iend and helper of humble worth; if he can seek it out, where failing health or adverse fortune presses it hard, and soften or stay the bitter hours that are hastening it to madness or to the grave; if he can stand between the oppressor and his prey, and bid the fetter and the dungeon give up their victim ; if he can build up great institutions of learning, and academies of art ; if he can open fountains of knowledge for the p eople, and conduct it s streams in the ri ght channels; if he can do better for the poor thzn to bestow alms upon the m-even to think of them, and devise plans for their elevation in knowledge and vi rtue, instead of forever opening the , old reservoirs a nd resources for thei r improvidence; if he has sufficient heart and soul to do all this, or par t of it; if wealth would be ta him the handmaid of exertion; facilitating effo rt, and giving success to endeavor; then may he lawful ly, and yet warily and mode stly, desire it. But if it is to do nothing for him, but (o minister ease and indulgenc e, and to place his children in the same bad school, then there is no reason why he should desire it. What is there glorious in the world, that is not the product of labor, either of the body or of the mi nd? What is history, but its record? What are the treasures of genius and art, but its work? What are cultivated fields, but its toil? The busy marts, the rising cities, t he enriched empires of the world are but the great treasure-houses of labor. The pyramids of Egypt, the' castles and towers and temples of Euro pe, the buried citi es of Italy and Mexico, the canals and railroads of Christendom , are but tracks, all r ound the worl d, of the mighty footsteps of labor. Without it antiquity woul d not have been. Without it, there would be no memory of the past, and no hope for the future. Even utter indolence reposes on treasures that labor at some time gained and gathered. He that does no thing, and yet does not starve, has still his significance ; for he is a standing proof that somebody has at some time worked. But not to such does Masonr y do honor. It honor s the Worker, the Toiler; him who produces and not alone consum es; him who puts forth his hand to add to the treasury of human comforts, and not alone to take away. \" It honors him who goes forth amid the struggling elements to fight hi s battle, and who shrinks not, with cowardly effeminacy, behind pill ows of ease. It honors the strong muscle, and the ma nly nerve, and the resolute and brave heart, the sweating brow, and the toili ng brain. It honors the gr eat and beautiful offices of humanity, manhood' s toil and woman's task; paternal industry and maternal watching and weariness ; wi sdom teaching and patienc e learning; the brow of care that presides over the State, and many ha nded labor that toils in workshop, field, and study, beneath its mild and beneficent sway. God has not made a wo rld of rich men; but rather a world of poor men; or of men, at least, who must toil for a subsistence. That is, then, the best condition for man, and the grand sphere of human improvement., If the whole world c ould acquire weal th (and one man is as much entitled to it as another, when he is bo rn) ; if the present gen eration could lay up a complete provision for the next, as some men desire to do for their children; the world would be destroye d at a single blow. All industry would cease with "},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"the necessity for it ; all improvement would stop with the demand for exertion; the dissipation of fortunes, the mischief of which are now countervail ed by the healthful tone of society, would breed universal di sease, and wreak out into universal license ; and the. world would sink , rotten as Herod, into the grave of its own loathsome vices. Almost all the noblest things that have been achieved in the world, have been achieved by poor men ; poor scholars, poor professional men, poor artisans and ar tists, poor philosophers, p oets, and men of genius. A certain solidness and sobriety, a certain moderatio n and restrain t, a certain pressure of circumstance s, are good for ma n. liis body was not made for luxuries. It sickens, sin ks, and dies under them. His mind was not made for indulgerice. It grows weak , effeminate, and dwarfish, under that condition. And he who pampers his b ody with luxuries and his mi nd with indulge nce, bequeaths the consequences to the minds and bodies of his descendants, without the wealth which was their cause. For wealth, with out a law of entail to help it, has always lacked the energy ev en to keep its own treasures. They drop from its imbecile hand. The third ge neration almost in evitably goes down the rolling wheel of fortune, and ther e learns the energy necessa ry to rise again, if it rises at all ; heir, as it is, to t he bodily diseases, and mental weaknesses, and the soul's vices of it s andestors, and not heir to their wealth. And yet we are, almost all of us, anxious to put our ch ildren, or to insure that our grandchildren s hall be put, on this road to indulgence, luxury, vice, degradation, and ru in ; this headship of heredita ry disease, soul malady, and mental leprosy. If wealth were em ployed in promoting mental culture at home and works of philanthropy abroad ; if it were multiplying studie s of art, and building up institutions of learning around us; if it were in every way raising the intellectual charac ter of the worl d, there could scarcel y be too much of it. But if the utmost aim, e ffort, and ambition of we alth be, to procure rich furniture, and provide cost ly entertainments, and bu ild luxurious houses, and minister to vanity, extrav agance, and ostentation, t here could scarcely be too little of it. To a certain extent it may lauda bly be the minist er of elegancies and luxuries, and the servitor of hospitality and physical enjoyment: but just in proportion as it s tendencies, divested of all higher aims and tastes, are running that way, they ar e running to pe ril and evil. Nor does that peril atta ch to individuals and families alo ne. It stands, a fearful beacon, in the ex perience of Cities, Republ ics, and Empires. The lessons of past times, on th is subject, are emphatic and solemn. The history of wealth has always been a hi story of corruptio n and downfall. the people never existed that could stand t he trial. Boundle ss profusion is to o little likely to spread for any people the t heatre of manly ene rgy, rigid self -denial, and lofty virtue. You do not look for the bone an d sinew and strength of a country, its loftiest talents and virtue s, its martyrs to patriotism or religion, its men to meet the days of peril and disaster, among the chil dren of ease, indulgence, and luxury. In the great march of the races of me n over the earth, we have always seen opulence and luxury sinking before poverty and toil an d hardy nurture. That is the law which has presided over the great professi ons of empire. Sidon and Tyre, whose merchants posse ssed the wealth of prince s ; Babylon and Palmyra, the seats of Asiatic luxury ; Rome , laden with the s poils of a world, "},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"overwhelmed by her own vices more than by the hosts of her enemies ; all these, and many more, are examples of the destroytive tendenc ies of immense and unnatural accumulation : and men must become more generous and benevolent, not more selfish and effeminate, as they becom e more rich, or t he history of modern wealth will follow in the sad train of all past examples. All men desire distinction, and feel the need of some ennoblin g object in life. Those persons are usually most happy and sati sfied in their pursuits, who have the loftiest ends in view. Ar tists, mechanics, and invent ors, all who seek to find principles or develop beauty in their work, seem most to enjoy it. The farmer who labors for the beautifyi ng and scientific cultiv ation of his estate, is more happy in his labors than one who tills his own land for a mere subsistence. This is one of the signal testimonies wh ich all human employments give to the high demands of our nature. To gather wealth never gives such satisfaction as to bring the humblest piece of ma chinery to perfection : at least, when wealth is sou ght for display and ostentat ion, or mere luxury, and ease, and pleasure ; and not for ends of philanthropy, t he relief of kindred, or the payment of just deb ts, or as a means to atta in some other great and noble object. With the pursuits of mult itudes is connected a pai nful conviction that they neither supply a suffici ent object, nor confer any satisfactory honor. Why work, if the world is soon not to know that such a bein g ever existed ; and when one can perpetuat e his name neither on canvas nor on marble, nor in books, nor by lofty eloquence , nor statesmanship ? The answer is, that every man has a wo rk to do in hi mself, greater and sublimed than any work of genius ; and works upon a nobler materi al than wood or marble-upon his own soul and intellect, and may so attain the highest nobleness and grandeur k nown on earth or in Heaven; may so be the greatest of artists, and of authors, and his life, which is far more than speech, may be eloquent. The great author or ar tist only portrays what every man should be. He conceives, what we shou ld do. He conceives, and represents moral beauty, magnanimity, fort itude, love, devotion, forgivenes s, the soul's greatness. He portrays virtues, commended to our admiration and imit ations. To embody these portraitures in our lives is fhe practical realization of those great ideals of art. The magnanimity of Her oes, celebrated on the hist oric or poetic page; the constancy and faith of Truth's martyrs ; the beauty of love and piety glowing on the canvas; the de lineations of Truth and Right, that flash from the lips of the Eloquent, are, in thei r essence only that whic h every man may feel and practice in the daily walks of life. The work of virt ue is nobler than any work of genius ; for it is a nobler thing to be a hero than to describe one to endure martyrdom than to paint it, to do right than to plead for it. Action is greater than writing. A good man is a nobl er object of contemplation than a great author. There are but two things worth living fo r: to do what is worthy of being written; and to write what is worthy of being read; and the greater of these is the doing. Every man has to do the nobles t thing that any man can do or describe. There is a wide field for the cour age, cheerfulness, energy, and di gnity of human existence. Let therefore no Mason dee m his life doomed to mediocrity or meanness, to vanity or unp rofitable toil, or to any ends less than immortal. No "},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"one can truly say that the grand prizes of life are for others, and he can do nothing. No matter how m agnificent and noble an ac t the author can describe or the artist paint,' it will be still nobler for you to go and do that which one describes, or be the model which the other draws. The loftiest action that ever was describ ed is not more magnatemous than that which we may find occasion to do, in t he daily walks of life ; in temptation, in distress, in bereavement , in the solemn approach to death. In the great Providence of God, in t he great ordinances of our being, there is opened to every man a sphere for the noblest action. It is no t even in extraordinary situations, where all eyes are upon us, wher e all our energy is aroused, and all our vigilance is awak e that the highest efforts of virtue are usually demanded of us ; but rather in silence and seclusio n, amidst our occupations and our homes; in wearing si ckness, that makes no co mplaint; in sorely-tried honesty, that asks no praise ; in simple disinter estedness, hiding the hand that resigns its advantage to another. Masonry seeks to enn oble common life. Its work is to go down into the obscure and researched records of daily conduct and feeling; an d to portray, not the ordinary virtue of an extraordinary life ; but the more extr aordinary virtue of ordinary life. What is done and borne in the shades of privacy, in the hard and beaten pafh of daily ca re and toil, full of rece lebrated sacrifices; in the suffering, and so metimes insulted suffering, that wears to the world a cheerful brow ; in the Iong strife of the spirit, resisti ng pain, penury , and neglect, carried on in the inmost depths of the heart;-what is done, and borne, and wrought, and won there, is a higher glory, and shall inherit a bri ghter crown. On the volume of Masonic life one bright word is written from which on every side blazes an ineffabl e splendor. That word is DUTY. To aid in securing to all labor permanent empl oyment and its just reward: to help to hasten the coming of that time when no one shall suffer from hunger or destitution, because, though willing and able to work, he can find no employme nt, or because he has been overtaken by sickness in the midst of his labor, are part of your duties as a Knight of the Royal Axe. And if we can succeed in making some small nook of God's creation a litt le more fruitful and c heerful, a little better and more worthy of Him,-or in making some one or two hu man hearts a little wiser, and more manful an d hopeful and happy, we shall have don e work, worthy of Masons, and acceptable to our Father in Heaven. XXIII CHIEF OF THE TABERNACLE. AMONG most of t he Ancient Nations there was, in addition to their public worship, a privat e one styled the Mysteries ; to which those only were admitted who had been prepared by certai n ceremonies called initiations. The most widely dissemi nated of the ancient wo rships were those of Isis, Orpheus, Dionysus, Ceres and Mathias. Ma ny barbarous nations received the know ledge of the Mysteries in honor of these divinities from the Egyptians, befor e they arrived in Gr eece; and even in the British Isles the Druids celebrated those of Di onysus, learned by them from the Egyptians. "},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"The Mysteries of Eleusis , celebrated at Athens in honor of Ceres, swallowed up as it were, all the others. All the neighboring nations neglected their own, to celebrate those of El eusis; and in a little while all Greece and Asia Minor were filled with th e Initiates. They spread into the Roman Em pire, and even beyond its limits, \"those holy and august Eleusinian Myst eries,\" said Cicero, \"in which the people of the remotest lands are initiated.\" Zosimus says that they embraced the whole human race ; and Aristides term ed them the comm on temple of the whole world. There were, in the Eleusinian feas ts, two sorts of Mysteries, the great, and the little. T he latter were a kind of preparati on for the former ; and everybody was admitted to them. Ordinar ily there was a novitiate of three, and sometimes of four years. Clement of Alexandria says that what was taught in the great Mysteries concerned the Universe, and was the completion and perfection of all inst ruction; wherein things were seen as they were, and natur e and her works were made known. The ancients said that the Initiates would be more happy after death than other mortals ; and that, while the souls of the Profane on leaving their bodies, would be plunged in the mire, and remain buried in darkness, those of the Initiates woul d fly to the Fortunate Isles, the abode of the Gods. Plato said that the obj ect of the Mysteries wa s to re-establish the soul in its primitive purity, and in that state of perfection which it had lost. Epictetus said, \"whatever is met with th erein has been instituted by our Masters, for the instruction of man and the correction of morals.\" Process held that initiation elev ated the soul, fr om a material, sensual, and purely human life, to a communion an d celestial intercourse with the Gods ; a nd that a variety of things , forms, and species were shown Initiates, representing th e first generation of the Gods. Purity of morals and elev ation of soul were requ ired of the, Initiates. 'Candidates were required to be of spotless reputation and irreproachable virtue. Ne ro, after murdering his mother, did not dare to be present at the celebr ation of the Mysteries: and Antony presented himself to be initiated, as the most infallible mode of proving his innocence of the deat h of Avidius Cassius. The Initiates were regar ded as the only fortunat e men. \"It is upon us alone,\" says Aristophan es, \"shineth the beneficent daystar. We alone receive pleasure from the influence of his rays; we, who are initiated, and who practice toward citizen and stranger ever y possible act of justice and piety.\" And it is theref ore not surprising that, in time, initiation came to be considered as necessary as baptism afterward was to the Christians ; and that not to have been adm itted to the Mysteries was held a dishonor. \"It seems to me,\" says the great orator, philosopher , and moralist, Cicero, \"that Athens, am ong many excellent in ventions, divine and very useful to the human family, has produced none comp arable to the Mysteries, which for a wild and fero cious life have su bstituted humanity and urbanity of manners. ‘It is wi th good reason they use the term "},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"initiation; for it is through them that we in realit y have learned the first principles of life; and they not only teach us to live in a manner more consoling and agreeabl e, but they soften the pains of death by the hope of a better life hereafter.\" Where the Mysteries orig inated is not known. I t. is supposed that they came from India, by th e way of Chaldaea , into Egypt, and thence were carried into Greece. Wher ever they arose, they were practiced among all the ancient nations; and, as was usual, the Th racians, Cretins, and Athenians each claimed t he honor of inventio n, and each insisted that they had borrowed noth ing from any other people. In Egypt and the East, all religions even in its most poetical forms, was more or less a myst ery; and the chief reas on why, in Greece, a distinct name and office were assigned to the Myst eries, was because the superficial popular theology left a wa nt unsatisfied, which religion in a wider sense alone coul d supply. They were pr actical acknowledgments of the insufficiency of the popular reli gion to satisfy the deeper thoughts and aspirations of the mind. The vagueness of symbolism might perhaps reach what a more palpabl e and conventional creed could not. The former, be its indefinitene ss, acknowledged the abstru seness of its subject; it treated a mysterious subj ect myopically ; it e ndeavored to illustrate what it could not explain; to excite an appropr iate feeling, if it could not develop an adeq uate idea; and shade the im age a mere subordinate conveyance for the concep tion, which itself neve r became too obvious or familiar. The instruction now conveyed by boo ks and letters was of old conveyed by symbols; and the priest had to invent or to perpetuate a display of rites and exhibitions, wh ich were not only more attractive to the eye than words, but often to the mind more sugges tive and ~p regnant with meaning. Afterward, the institution became rather moral a nd political, than religious. The civil magistrates shape d the ceremonies to political ends in Egypt; the sages who carried them from that country to Asia, Greece; and the North of Europe, were all kings or legi slators. ,The chief magistrate presided at those of Eleusis, repres ented by an officer styled King: and the Priest played but a subordinate part. The Powers revered in th e Mysteries were all in reality Natured Gods; none of whom could be consistently addressed as mere heroes, because their nature was co nfessedly super-heroic. The Mysteries, only in fact a more solemn expression of the religion of th e ancient poe try, taught that doctrine of the Theocracia or Divine Oneness, which even poetry does not entirely conceal. They were not in any open ho stility with the popular religion, but only a more solemn exhibiti on of its symbols; or rather a part of itself in a more impressive form. The essence of all Mysteries, as of all pol ytheism, consists in th is, that the conception of an inapproachable Being, single, eternal, and unc hanging, and that of a God of Nature, wh ose manifold power is immediately revealed to the senses in the incessant round of movement, life, and. death, fell asunder in the tr eatment, and were separately symbolized. They offered a perpetual problem to exci te curiosity, aqd cont ributed to satisfy the all-pervading religious sentiment, which if it obtain no nourishment "},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"among the scruple and inte lligible, finds compensa ting excitement in a reverential contemplat ion of the obscure. Nature is as free from dogm atism as from tyranny; and the earliest instructors of mankind not onl y adopted her lessons, but as far as possible ad hered to her meth od of imparting them. They attempted to reach th e understanding thro ugh the eye ; and the greater part of a ll religious teaching was conveyed through this ancient and most impressi ve mode of \"exhibition\" or demonstration. The Mysteries were a sacred drama, exhibiting some legend significant of Nature's change, of th e visible Universe in i which the divinity is revealed, an d whose import was in many respects as open to the Pagan, as to the Christian. Beyond the current traditions or sacred recitals of the temple, few explanations we re given to the spectators, who were left, as in the school of nature, to make inferences for themselves. The method of indirect suggestion, by allegory or symbol, is a more efficacious instrument of instruction than pl ain didactic \"language ; since we are habitually indifferent to that which is acquired without effort : \"The initiate d are few, though many bear the thyrsus.\" And it would have been impossible to provide a lesson suit ed to every degree of cultivation and capacity, unless it were one framed after Nature's example, or rather a r epresentation of Nature herself, employing her universal symbolism instead of tech nicalities of la nguage, inviting endless research, yet rewarding the humblest inquirer , and disclosing its secrets to every one in propor tion to his prepar atory training and power to comprehend them. Even if destitute of any formal or official enunciation of those important truths, which even in a cultivated age it was often found inexpedient to assert except under a veil of all egory, and which moreover lose their dignity and va lue in proportion as they are learned mechanically as dogmas, the shows of the Myster ies certainly contained suggestions if not lessons, which in the opinion not of one competent witness only, but if many , were adapted to elevat e the character of the spectators, enabling them to augur something of the purposes of existence, as well as of the means of employing it, to live better and to die happier. Unlike the religion of books or cree ds, these mystic shows performances were not the reading of a lecture, but the opening of a problem, implying neither exempti on from research, nor hos tility to philosophy : for, on the contra ry, philosophy is t he great Mystagogue or Arch-Expounder of symbolism : though t he interpretations by the Grecian Philosophy of the old myths and sym bols were in many instances as ill-founded, as in others they are correct. No better means could be devised to rouse a dormant intellect than those impressive exhibitions, which addressed it through the imagination: which, instead of condemning it to a prescribed routine of creed, invited it to seek, compar e, and judge. Th e alteration from symbol to dogma is as fa tal to beauty of expressi on, as that from faith to dogma is to truth and wholesomeness of thought The first philosophy often reverted to the natural m ode of teaching; "},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"and Socrates, in particular, is said to have eschewed dogmas, endeavoring, like the Mysteries, ra ther to awaken an d develop in the minds of his hearers the ideas with which they were already endowed or pregnant, than to fill them with ready-m ade adventitious opinions. So Masonry still follow s the ancient manner of teaching. Her symbols are the instruction she gives ; and the lectures are but often partial and insufficient one-sided endeavors to interpre t those symbols. He who would become an accompli shed Mason must not be c ontent merely to hear or even to understand the lectures, but must, aided by them, and they having as it were marked out the wa y for him, study, interpret, and develop the symbols for himself. The earliest speculation endeavored to express fa r more than it could distinctly comprehend ; and the vag ue impressions if the mind found in the mysterious analogies of p henomena their most apt and energetic representations. The Mysteries, like the symbols of Maso nry, were but an image of the eloqu ent analogies of Nature ; both those and these revealing no new secret to such as were or are unprepared, or incapable of interpreting their significance. Everywhere in the old Mysteries, and in all the symbolisms and ceremonial of the Hiero phant was found t he same mythical personage, who, like Hermes, or Zoroaster, unites Human Attributes with Divine, and is himself the God whose worship he introduced, te aching rude men the commencements of ci vilization throu gh the influence of song, and connecting with the symbol of his death, emblemat ic of that of Nature, the most essential cons olations of religion. The Mysteries embraced the three great doctrine s of Ancient Theosophy. They treated of God, M an, and Nature. Dionysus, whose Mysteries Orpheus is said to have founded, was the God of Nature, or of the moisture which is the life of Nature, who prepares in darkness the return of life and vegetation, or who is him- self t he Light and Change evolving their varieties. He was theologicall y one with Hermes, Prometheus, and Poseidon. In the Aegean Islands he is Butes, Darda nus, Himeros, or Imbros. In Crete he appea rs as Iasius or Zeus, whose worship remaining unveiled by the usual form s of mystery, betrayed to profane curiosity the symbols, which, if irreverently contemplated, were sure to be misunderstood. In Asia he is the long-stol ed Bassareus coalescing with the Sabazius of the Phrygian Coryb antes : the same with the mystic Iacchus, nursling or son of Ceres, and with the dismembered Zagreus, son of Persephone. In symbolical forms the Mysteries exhibited TH E ONE, of which THE MANIFOLD Is an infinite illustra tion, containing a moral lesson, calculated to guide the so ul through life, and to cheer it in death. The story of Dionysus was profoundly sign ificant. He was not only creator of the world, but guardian , liberator, and Savior of the soul. God of the many-colored mantle, he wa s the resulting manifest ation personified, the all in the many, the varied year, li fe passing into innumerable forms. The spiritual regeneration of man was typified in the Mysteries by the second birth of Dionysu s as offspring of t he Highest ; and the agents and symbols of that regen eration were the elem ents that affected Nature's periodical purification-the ai r, indicated by the mystic fan or "},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"winnow ; the fire, signifi ed by the torch ; and t he baptismal water, for water is not only cleanser of all things, but the genes is or source of all. Those notions, clothed in ritual, sug gested the soul's, reformation and training, the moral purity formally proclaimed at Eleusis. He only was invited to approach, w ho was \"of clean hands and ingenuous sp eech, free from all pollu tion, and with a clear conscience.\" -\"Happy t he man,\" say the initiated in Euripides and Aristophanes, \"who pur ifies his life, and who reve rently consecrates his soul in the thirsts of the God. Let him take he ed to his lips that he utter no profane word; le t him be just and kind to the stranger, and to his neighbor; let him give way to no vicious exce ss, lest he make dull and heavy the organs of the spirit. Far from the mystic dance of the thirsts be the impure, the evil s peaker, the seditious citizen, the selfish hunter after gai n, the traitor ; all those, in short, whose practices are more akin to the riot of Titans than to the regulated life of the Orphici, or the Curetan order of the Pr iests of Idaean Zeus.\" The votary, elevated beyond the spher e of his ordinary faculties, and unable to account for th e agitation which over powered him, seemed to become divine. in proport ion as he ceased to be human; to be a demon or god. Already, in imagin ation, the initiated were numbered among the beatified. They alone en joyed the true li fe, the Sun's true lustre, while they hymned their God beneath the mystic groves of a mimic Elysium, and were really renovat ed or regenerated under the genial influence of their dances. \"They whom Proserpine guides in he r mysteries,\" it was said, \"who imbibed her instructi on and spiritual nourishment, rest from their labors and know strife no more. Happy they who witness and comprehend these sacred ceremonies ! They ar e made to know the meaning of the riddle of existence by observing it s aim and terminati on as appointed by Zeus ; they partake a b enefit more valuable and enduring than the grain bestowed by wares ; for they are ex alted in the scale of intellectual existence, and obtain sweet hopes to console them at their death.\" No doubt the ceremonies of initiation we re originally few and simple. As the great truths of the primitive revelati on faded out of the memories of the masses of the Peop le, and wickedness became rife upon the earth, it became necessary to discriminate, to require longer probation and satisfacto ry tests of the candi dates, and by spreading around what at first were rather schools of inst ruction than mysteries, the veil of secrecy, and the pomp of cere mony, to heighten the opinion of their value and importance. Whatever pictures later and especia lly Christian writ ers may draw of the Mysteries, they must, not only originally, but fo r many ages, have continued pure; and the doctrines of natural re ligion and morals there taught, have been of t he highest importance; because both the most virtuous as well as the mo st learned and phi losophic of the ancients speak of them in the loftiest terms. That they ultimately became degraded from t heir high estate, and corrupted, we know. The rites of initiation became pr ogressively more complicated. Signs and tokens were invented by which the Children of Light could with "},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"facility make themselves known to each other. Differ. ant Degrees were invented, as the number of Initiates enlarged, in order that there might be in the inner apartment of the Temple a favored few, to whom alone the more valuable secrets we re entrusted, and who could wield effectually the influence and power of the Order. Original ly the Mysteries were meant to be the beginning of a new life of reason and virtue. The initiated or esoteric companions we re taught the doct rine of the One Supreme God, the theory of death and eternity, the hidden mysteries of Nature, the prospect of the ultimate restoration of the soul to that state of perfection from which it had fallen, its immo rtality, and the states of reward and puni shment after death. The uninitiated were deemed Profane, unworthy of pu blic employment or priv ate confidence, sometimes prescribed as Atheists, and certain of everlast ing punishment beyond the grave. All persons were initiated into t he lesser Mysteries; but few attained the greater, in which the true spirit of them, and most of their secret doctrines were hidden. The veil of secrecy was impenetr able, sealed by oaths and penalties the most tr emendous and appal ling. It was by initiation only, that a knowledge of the Hieroglyphics could be obtained, with which the walls, colu mns, and ceilings of the Temples were decorated, and which, believed to have been communicated to the Priests by revelation from the celest ial deities, the yo uth of all ranks were laudably ambiti ous of deciphering. The ceremonies were performed at de ad of night, generally in apartments under-ground, but sometimes in the centre of a vast pyramid, with every appliance that could alarm and exci te the candidat e. Innumerable ceremonies, wild and ro mantic, dreadful and a ppalling, had by degrees been added to the few expressive symbol s of primitive observances, under which there were instanc es in which the terrif ied aspirant actually expired with fear. The pyramids we re probably used for the purposes of initiation, as were caverns, pagoda s, and labyrinths; for the ceremoni es required many apartments and cells, long passages an d wells. In Egypt a principal place for the Mysteries was the isl and of Philae on t he Nile, where a magnificent Temple of Osiris st ood, and his relics were said to be preserved. With their nat ural proclivities, the Prie sthood, that select and exclusive class, in Egypt, India, Phoenicia, Judea and Greece, as well as in Britain and Rome, and wherever else the M ysteries were known, made use of them to build wi der and higher th e fabric of thei r own power. The purity of no religion continues long. Rank and dignitie s succeed to the primitive simplicity. Unprincipled, vain, insolent, co rrupt, and venal men put on God's livery to serve th e Devil withal ; and luxury, vice, intolerance, and pri de depose frugality, vi rtue, gentleness, and humility, and cha nge the altar where they should be servants, to a throne on which they reign. But the Kings, Philosophers , and Statesmen, the wise and great and good who were admitt ed to the Mysteries, l ong postponed their ultimate self-destruction, and restrained the natural tenden cies of the Priesthood. And accordi ngly Zosimus thought that the neglect of the "},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Mysteries after Diocleti an abdicated, was the chie f cause of the decline of the Roman Empire ; a nd in the year 364, the Pr oconsul of Greece would not close the Mysterie s, notwithstanding a law of the Emperor Valentinian, lest th e people should be driven to desperation, if prevented from performing them; upon which, as they believed, the welfare of mankind whol ly depended. They were pr acticed in Athens until the 8th century in Greec e and Rome for several centuries after Christ; and in Wales and Scotland do wn to the 12th century. The inhabitants of Indi a originally practiced the Patriarchal religion. Even the later worship of Vishnu was cheerful and social ; accompanied with. the festive song, the spright ly dance, and th e resounding cymbal, with libations of milk and honey, garlands, and perfumes from aromatic woods and gums. There pe rhaps the Mysteries co mmenced; and in them, under allegories, we re taught the pr imitive truths. We cannot, within the limits of this lecture, detail the ceremonies of initiation; and shall use general languag e, except where some thing from those old Mysteries still remains in Masonry. The Initiate was invested with a co rd of three threads, so twined as to make three ti mes three, and called zennar. Hence comes our cable-tow. It was an em blem of their tri-une De ity, the remembrance of whom we also preserve in the th ree chief officers of our Lodges, presiding in the three quarters of that Universe which our Lodges represent; in our three greater and three lesser lights, our three movable and three immova ble jewels, and the thr ee pillars that support our Lodges. The Indian Mysteries were celebrated in su bterranean cavern's and grottos hewn in the so lid rock; and the Initia tes adored the Deity, symbolized by the solar fi re. The candidate, long wandering in darkness, truly wanted Light, and the worship ta ught him was the worship of God, the Source of Light. The vast Temple of Elephant s, perhaps the oldest in the world, hewn out of the rock, and 135 feet square , was used for initiations ; as were the still vast er caverns of Salsette, with their 300 apartments. The periods of initiation were regu lated by the incr ease and decrease of the moon. The M ysteries were divided into four steps or Degrees. The candidate might receive t he first at eight years of age, when he was invested with the zennar. Each Degree dispensed so mething of perfection. \"Let the wretched man,\" says the Hi topadesa, \"practic e virtue, whenever he enjoys one of the thre e or four religious Degrees ; let him be even-minded with all creat ed things, and that di sposition will be the source of virtue.\" After various ceremonies, chiefly re lating to t he unity and trinity of the Godhead, the candidate was clot hed in a linen ga rment without a seam, and remained under t he care of a Brahmin un til he was twenty years of age, constantly study ing and practisi ng the most rigid virtue. Then he underwent the seve rest probation for the se cond Degree, in which he was sanctified by the sign of the cr oss, which, pointing to the four quarters of the compass, was ho nored as a striking symbol of the Universe by many nations of antiquity, and was im itated by the Indians in the shape of their te mples. Then he was admitt ed to the Holy Cavern, "},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"blazing with light, where, in costly robes, sat, in the East, West, and South, the three chie f Hierophants, represent ing the Indian tri-une Deity. The ceremonies there commence d with an anthem to the Great God of Nature; and then followed this apostrophe : \"O mighty primal Creator! Eternal God of Gods! The World's M ansion! Th ou art the Incorruptible Being, distinct from all things transien t! Thou art before all Gods, the Ancient Absolute Exis tence, and the Su preme Supporter of the Universe! Thou art the Supreme Mansion; and by Thee, O Infinite Form, the Universe was spread abroad.\" The candidate, thus taug ht the first great prim itive truth, was called upon to make a formal declaration, that he would be tractable and obedient to his s uperiors; that he would keep his body pure ;. govern his tongue, and observe a passive obedience in receiving the doctrines and traditions of the Or der ; and the firmest se crecy in maintaining inviolable its hidden and abstruse mysteries. T hen he was sp rinkled with water (whence our baptism) ;' certain words, now unknown, were whispered in his ear; and he was divested of his shoes, and made to go three times around the cavern. Hence our three circuits ; hence we were neither barefoot nor shod: and t he words were t he Pass-words of that Indian Degree. The Gymnosophist Priests came from the banks of t he Euphrates into Ethiopia, and brought with them their sciences and their doctrines. Their principal Colleg e was at Meroe, and their Mysteries were celebrated in the Temple of Amun, renowned for hi s oracle. Ethiopia was then a powerful State, which prec eded Egypt in civi lization, and had a theocratic government. Above the King was the Priest, who could put him to death in the name of the Deit y. Egypt was then composed of the Thebaid only. Middle Egypt and the Delta were a gulf of the Mediterranean. The Nile by degrees formed an immense marsh, which, afterward drained by the labor of man, formed Lower Egypt; and was for many centuries governed by the Ethiopian Sacerdot al Caste, of Arabic origin ; afterward displaced by a dynasty of warrio rs. The magnificent ruins of Axiom, with it s obelisks and hieroglyphics, temples, vast tombs and pyramids, around ancient Meroe, are far older than the pyramids near Memphis. The Priests, taught by Hermosa embodied in books the occult and hermetic sciences, with t heir own discoveries and t he revelations of the Sibyls. They studied particularly t he most abstract sciences, discovered the famous geometrical th eorems which Pythagoras afterward learned from them, calculated eclips es, and regulated, ni neteen centuries before Caesar, the Julian year. They descended to practical investigations as to the necessiti es of life, and made known their discoveries to t he people ; they cultivated the fine arts, and inspired the people with that enthusiasm which produced the avenues of Thebes, the Labyrinth, the Temple s of Karnac, Denderah, Edfou, and Philae, the monolithic obelisks, and the great Lake Morris, the fertilizer of the country. The wisdom of the Eg yptian Initiates, the high sciences and lofty morality which they taught, and thei r immense knowled ge, excited the emulation of the most em inent men, whatever thei r rank and fortune ; and "},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"led them, despite the co mplicated and te rrible trials to be undergone, to seek admission into the M ysteries of Osiris and Isis. From Egypt, the Myster ies went to Phoenicia, and were celebrated at Tyre. Osiris changed his name, and bec ome Adoni or Dion ysos, still the representative of the Sun ; and afterward these Mysteries were introduced successively into Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Greece, Sicily, and Italy. In Greece and Sicily, Osiris took the name of Bacchus, and Isis that of Ceres, Cybele, Rhea and Venus. Bar Hebraeus says : \"Enoch was th e first who invented books and different sorts of writing. The anci ent Greeks declare that Enoch is the same as Mercury Trismegistus [Her mes], and that he taught the sons of men the art of building cities, and enacted some admi rable laws... He discovered the knowledge of the Zodiac, and the co urse of the Planets ; and he pointed out to the s ons of men, that they should worship God, that they should fast, that they should pray, that they should give aims, votive offerings, and tenths. He repro bated abominable foods and drunkenness, and appointed festivals for sacrifices to the Sun, at each of the 'Zodiacal Signs.\" Manetho extracted his history from certain pillars wh ich he discovered in Egypt, whereon inscr iptions had been made by Thoth, or the first Mercury [or Hermes], in the sacred letters and dialect: but which were after the flood translated from that dialect into the Greek tongue, and laid up in the private recesses of the Egyptian Temple s. These pillars were found in subterranea n caverns, near Thebes and beyond the Nile, not far from the sounding st atue of Memnon, it a pl ace called Syringes ; which are described to be certain winding apartments un derground ; made, it is said, by those who were skille d in ancient rites; who foreseeing the coming of the deluge , and fearing lest memo ry of their cere- monies should be oblite rated, built and contri ved vaults, dug with vast labor, in several places. From the bosom of Egypt sprang a m an of consummate wi sdom, initiated in the secret knowledge of India, of Persia, and of Ethiopia, named Thoth or Phtha by his compatriots, Taaut by the P hoenicians, Hermes Trismegistus by the Gree ks, and Adris by the Rabb ins. Nature seemed to have chosen him for her favorite, and to have lavished on him all the qualities necessary to enable him to study her and to know her thoroughly. The Deity had, so to say, infused into him the sciences and the arts, in order th at' he might instru ct the whole world. He invented many things necessary fo r the uses of life, and gave them suitable names ; he taugh t men how to write do wn their th oughts and arrange their speech; he in stituted the ceremonies to be observed in the worship of each of the Gods; he obser ved the course of the stars; he invented music, the diffe rent bodily exercises, arithmetic, medicine, the art of working in metals, the ly re with three st rings ; he regulated the three tones of the voice, the s harp, taken from autumn, the grave from winter, and the ,middle from spring, there being then but three seasons. It was he who taught the Greeks the m ode of interpreting terms and things, whence they gave him the name of `E e??? [Hermes], which signifies Interpreter. In Egypt he instituted hieroglyphics: he select ed a certain number of "},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"persons whom he judged fi tted to be the depositaries of his secrets, of such only as were capabl e of attaining the thro ne and the first offices in the Mysteries; he united them in a body, cr eated them Priests of the Living God, instructed them in the sciences and arts, and explained to them the symbols by which they were veiled. Egypt, 1 500 years before the time of Moses, revered in the Mysteries One SUPREME GOD, called the ONLY UNCREATED. Under Him it pa id homage to sev en principal deit ies, it is to Hermes, who lived at t hat period, that we must distribute the concealment or veiling [velation] of the Indian worship, which Moses unveiled or revealed, ch anging nothing of t be laws of Hermes, except the plurality of his mystic Gods. The Egyptian Priests related that He rmes, dying, said : \"Hitherto I have lived an exile from my true count ry: now I return thither. Do not weep for me : I return to that celestial count ry whither each goes in his turn, There is Go d. This life is bu t a death.\" This is precisely the creed of the old Buddhi sts of Samaneans, who believed that from time to time God sent Buddha’s on earth, to refo rm men, to wean them from their vices, and lead t hem back into the paths of virtue. Among the sciences taught by Hermes, there we re secrets which he communicated to the Init iates only upon condition that t hey should bind themselves, by a terrible oath, never to divulge them, except to those who, after long trial, should be found worthy to succeed them. The Kings even prohibited the revela tion of them on pain of death. This secret was styled the Sacerdotal Art, and in cluded alchemy, astrology, magnum [magic], the science of sp irits, etc. He gave them the key to the Hieroglyphics of all these secret sciences, which were regarded as sacred, and kept conceal ed in the roost secret places of the Temple. The great secrecy observed by the in itiated Priests, for many years, and the lofty sciences which they prof essed, caused t hem to be honored and respected througho ut all Egypt, which was regarded by other nations as the college, the sanctuary, of the sciences and arts. The mystery which surrounded them st rongly excited curiosity. Orpheus metamorphosed himself, so to say, into an Egyp tian. He was initiated into. Theology and Physics. And he so comp letely made the ideas and seasonings of his teachers his own, that his Hymns rat her bespeak an Egyptian Priest than a Grecian Poet : and he was the fi rst who carried into Greece the Egyptian fables. Pythagoras, ever thirsty for learning, consented even to be circumcised, in order to become o ne of the Initiate s: and the occult sciences were revealed to him in the innermost part of the sanctuary. The Initiates in a partic ular science, having been instructed by fables, enigmas, allegories, and hieroglyphics, wrote m ysteriously whenever in their works they touched the subject of the Mysteries, and continued to conceal science under a veil of fictions. When the destruction by Cambyses of many cities, and the ruin of nearly all Egypt, in the year 528 before our era, disp ersed most of the Pr iests into Greece and elsewhere, they bore wi th them their sciences, which they continued to teach enigmatically, that is to) sa y, ever enveloped in the obscurities of fables and hieroglyph ics ; to the end that' the vulgar herd, seeing, might see nothing and hearing, might compr ehend nothing. All the "},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"writers drew from this source : but these Mysteries, concealed under so many unexplained envelopes, ended in givi ng birth to a swarm of absurdities, which, from Greece, sp read over the whole earth. In the Grecian Mysteries, as established by Pythagoras, there were three Degrees. A preparation of five years' abst inence and silence was required. If th e candidate was found to be passionate or intemperate, contentious, or am bitious of worl dly honors and distinctions, he was rejected. In his lectures, Pythagor as taught the mathemati cs, as a medium whereby to prove the existence of God from observation an d by means of reason ; grammar, rhetoric, and logic, to cultivate an d improve that reason, arithmetic, because he c onceived that the ulti mate benefit of man consisted in the science of numbers, and geometry, music, and astronomy, because he conceived t hat man is indebted to them for a knowledge of what is really good and useful. He taught the true meth od of obtaining a know ledge of th e Divine laws of purifying the soul fr om its imperfections, of searching for truth, and of practicing virtue; thus imit ating the perfecti ons of God. He thought his system vain, if it did not contribute to expel vice and introduce virtue into t he mind. He taught that the two most excellent things were, to speak th e truth, and to render benefits to one another. particularly he inculcated Silence, Temperance, Fo rtitude, Prudence, and Justice. He taught' the immortality of the soul , the Omnipotence of God, and the necessity of per sonal holiness to qualif y a man for admission into the Society of the Gods. Thus we owe the part icular mode of instru ction in the Degree of Fellow-Craft to Pythagoras ; and that Degree is but an imperfect reproduction of his le ctures. From him, too, we have many of our explanations of the symbols. He arra nged his assemblies due East and West, because he held that Motion began in the East a nd proceeded to the West. Our Lodges are said to be due East and West, because the Master represents the rising Sun, and of course must be in the East. The pyramids, too, were built precisely by the four cardinal points. And our expression. that our Lodges extend upwa rd to the Heavens, comes from the Persian and Druidic cust om of having to their Temples no roofs but the sky. Plato developed and spir itualized. the philoso phy of Pythagoras Even Eusebius the Christian admits, that he reached to the vestibule of Truth, and stood upon its threshol d. The Druidical ceremonies undoubtedly came from Indi a; and the Druids were originally Buddhists. The word Druid, like the word Magi , signifies wise or learned men ; and they were at once philosophers, magistrates, and ,divines. There was a surprising uniformity in the Temples, Pr iests, doctrines, and worship of the Pe rsian Magi and British Drui ds. The Gods of Britain were the same as the Cabiri of Samothrace. Osiris and Isis appeared in their Mysteries, under th e names of Hu and Ceri dwen; and like those of the primitive Persians, their Temp les were enclosures of huge unhewn stones, some of which still rema in, and are regarded by the common people with fear a nd veneration. They were gene rally either circular or oval. Some were in the shape of a circle to wh ich a vast serpent was "},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"attached. The circle was an Easter n symbol of the Universe, governed by an Omnipotent Deity whose center is everywhere, and hi s circumference nowhere : and the egg was an universal symbol of the worl d. Some of the Temples were winged, and some in the shape of a cross; the winged ones referring to Kneph, the winged Serpent-Dei ty of Egypt ; whence the name of Navestock, wher e one of them stoo d. Temples in the shape of a cross were also found in Irel and and Scotland. The length of one of these vast structures, in the shape of a se rpent, was nearly three miles.. The grand periods for initiation in to the Druidical Mysteries, were quarterly; at the eq uinoxes and solstices. In the remote ti mes when they originated, these were the time s corresponding wi th the 13th of February, 1st of May, 19 th of August, and 1st of November. The time of annual celebration was May-Eve, and the ceremoni al preparations commences at midnight, on the 29th of April. When the initiations were over, on May-Eve, fires were kindled on all the ca irns and cromlechs in the island, which burned all night to introduce the sp orts of May-day. The festival was in honor of the Sun. The initia tions were performed at midnight ; and there were three Degrees. The Gothic Mysteries were carried Northward from the East, by Odin ; who, being a great warrior, modeled and varied them to suit his purposes and the genius of hi s people. He placed over their celebration twelve Hierophants, who we re alike Priests, Counselo rs of State, and Judges from whose decision there was no appeal. He held the numbers three and nine in peculiar veneration, and was probably himself the Indian Buddha. Every thrice-three months, th rice-three victims were sacrificed to the try-une God. Th e Goths had three great festivals; the most magnificent of which commenced at the winter so lstice, and was celebrated in honor of Th or, the Prince of the Power of t he Air. That being the longest night in the year, and thro ne after which the Sun comes Northward, it was commemorati ve of the Creation ; and they termed it mother-night, as the one in whic h the creation of t he world and light from the primitive darkness took pl ace. This was the Yule, Jitul, or Yeof feast, which afterward becam e Christmas. At this feast the initiations were celebrat ed. Thor was the Sun, th e Egyptian Osiris and Kneph, the Physi cian Bel or Baal. The in itiations were had in huge-intricate caverns, te rminating, as all the Mi thriac caverns did, in a spacious vault, where the candi date was brought to light. Joseph was undoubtedly in itiated. After he ha d interpreted Pharaoh's dream, that Monarch made him his Pr ime Minister, let him ride in his second chariot, while t hey proclaimed before him, ABRSCHI (*An Egytian word,meaning, \"Bow down. \") and set him over the land of Egypt. In addition to this, th e King gave hid a new nam e, Tsapanat-Paanakh, and married him to Asanat, daughter of Potai Pari ng, a Priest of An or Hieropolis, where was the Temple of Athom-Re, the Gr eat God of Egypt; thus completely naturalizing him. He could not have contracted this marriage, nor have exercised that high dignity, wit hout being first initiated in the Mysteries. When hi s Brethren came to Egypt the second time, the Egyptians of hi s court could not eat with them, as that would have been abomination, th ough they ate with Jose ph; who was therefore regarded not as a foreigner , but as one of themselves: and when he sent "},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"and brought his brethr en back, and charged them wi th taking his cup, he said, \"Know ye not that a man like me prac tices divination?\" thus assuming the Egyptian of high rank initiated into the Mysteries, sad as such conversant with the occult sciences. So also must Moses have been init iated for he was not only brought up in the court of the Ki ng, as the adopted son of the Kingly daughter, until he was forty year s of age ; but he was instructed in all the learning of the Egypti ans, and married afte r ward the daughter of Yethru, a Priest of An likewise. St robo and Diodorus bot h assert that he was himself a Priest of Heliopolis. Before he went into the Desert, there were intimate relations betwe en him and the Prie sthood ; and he had successfully commanded, Josephus in forms us, an army sent by the King against the Ethiopians. Simplicius asserts that Moses received from the Egyptians, in the M ysteries, the doctrines wh ich he taught to the Hebrews: and Clement of Alexandria and Phil o say that he was a Theologian and Prophet, an d interpreter of the Sacred Laws. Manetho, cited by Josephus, says he was a Pr iest of Heliopolis, and that his true and original (Egyptian) name was Asersaph or Osarsiph. And in the institution of the Hebrew Priestho od, in the powers and privileges, as well as the immuniti es and sanctity which he conferred upon them, he cl osely imitated the Egyptian institutions ; making public the worship of that Deity whom t he Egyptian Initia tes worshipped in private ; and strenuously ende avoring to keep the people from relapsing into their old mixture of Chalda ic and Egyptian superstition and idol-worship, as they were ever read y and inclined to do ; even Aharun, upon their first cl amorous discontent, restorin g the worship of Apis; as an image of which Egyptian God he made the golden calf. The Egyptian Priests taugh t in their great Mysteries, that there was one God, Supreme a nd inapproachable, who had c onceived the Universe iy His Intelligence, before He created it by His Power and Will. They were no Materialists nor Pantheists ; but taught that Matter was not eternal or co-existent with the great Fi rst Cause, but created by Him. The early Christians, ta ught by the fo under of their Religion, but in greater perfection, those primitive truths that from the Egyptians had passed to the Jews, and been preserved among the latter by the Essenes, received also the inst itution of the Mysteries ; adopting as their object the building of the symbolic Temple, preserving the old Scriptures of the Jews as their sa cred book, and as t he fundamental law, which furnished the new ve il of initiation with the Hebraic words and formulas, that, corrupte d and disfigured by time and ignorance, appear in many of our Degrees. Such, my Brother, is t he doctrine of the first Degree of the Mysteries, or that of chief of the Tabernacle, to wh ich you have now been admitted, and the moral lesson of which is, devotion to the service of God, and disinterested zeal and co nstant endeavor for the welfare of men.

PRINCE OF THE TABERNACLE. SYMBOLS were the almost universal language of ancien t theology. They were the most obvious method of inst ruction ; for, like nature herself, they addressed the understanding thro ugh the eye ; and t he most ancient expressions denoting communication of religiou s knowledge, signify ocul ar exhibition. The first teachers of mankind borrowed this method of instructio n ; and it comprised an endless store of pregnant hier oglyphics. These lessons of the olden time were the riddles of the Sphynx, tempting the curious by thei r quaintness, but involving the personal risk of the adventurous interpreter. \"The Gods themselves,\" it was said, \"disclose thei r intentions to the wise, but to fools their teaching is unintellig ible ;\" and the Ki ng of the Delphic Oracle was said not to declare, nor onthe ot her hand to conceal ; but emphatically to \"intimate or signify.\" The Ancient Sages, both ba rbarian and Greek, involved their meaning in similar indirections and enigmas ; their lessons were conv eyed either in visible symbols, or in those \"parab les and dark sayings of ol d,\" which the Israelites considered it a sacred du ty to hand down unchanged to successive generations. The explanatory tokens employed by ma n, whether emblemat ical objects or actions, symbols or mystic ceremonies, we re like the mystic signs and portends either in dreams or by the wayside, supposed to he signific ant of the intentions of the Gods ; both required the aid of anxious thought and skillful interpretation. It was only by a conect appreciation of analogous problems of nature, that the wi ll of Heaven could be underst ood iy the Diviner, or the lessons of Wisdom become manifest to the Sage. The Mysteries were a seri es of symbols ; and what was spoken there consisted wholly of accessory expl anations of the act or im age ; sacred commentaries, explanatory of established symbols; with little of those independent traditions embodying physical or moral speculation, in which the elements or planets were the Sage. actors, and the creation and revolution s of the world were intermingled with recollections of ancient events : and yet with so much of that also, that nature became he r own expositor through th e medium of an arbitrary symbolical instruction; and the ancient vi ews of the relation between the human and divine received dramatic forms. There has ever been an in timate alliance between t he two systems, the symbolic and the philosophical, in th e allegories of the monume nts of all ages, in the symbolic writings of the pr iests of all nations, in th e rituals of all secret and mysterious societies; there has bee n a constant series , an invariable uniformity of principles, which come fr om an aggregate, va st imposing, and true, composed of pa rts that fit harmoni ously only there."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Symbolical instruction is recommended by t he constant and' uniform usage of antiquity, - and it has re tained its influenc e throughout all ages , as a system of mysterious communicati on. The Deity, in his reve lations to man, adopted the use of material images for the purpose of enforcing sublime truths; and Christ taught by symbols and parables. The myster ious knowledge of the Druids was embodied in signs and symbols. Taliesin, describing his initia tion, says : \"The secrets were imparted to me by the old Giantess (Cerid wen, or Isis), without the use of audible languag e.\" And again he says, \"I am a silent proficient\" Initiation was ,a school, in which were taught the trut hs of primitive revelation, the existence and attributes of one God, the immortality of the Soul, rewards and p unishments in a future life, the phenomena of Nature, the arts, the sciences, morali ty, regulation, philosophy , and philanthropy, and what we now style psychol ogy and metaphysics, with animal magnetis m, and the other occult sciences. All the ideas of the Prie sts of Hindustan, Persia, Syria, Arabia, Chaldaea, Phoenicia, were known to the Egyptian Priests. The ratio nal Indian philosophy, after penetrating Persia and Chaldaea, gave birt h to the Egyptian Mysteries. We find that the use of Hierogl yphics was preceded in Egypt by that of the easily understood symbols a nd figures, from the mineral , animal, a nd vegetable kingdoms, used by the In dians, Persians, and Chal dans to express their thoughts; and this primit ive philosophy was the basis of the modern philosophy of Pythagoras and Plato. - All the philo sophers and legislators that made Antiquity illustrious, were pupils of the initiation; and all the beneficent modifications in the religions of the di fferent people instru cted by them were owing to their institution and extension of th e Mysteries In the chaos of popular superstitions, thos e Mysteries alone kept man from lapsing into absolute brutishness. Zoroaster and Conf ucius drew their doctrines from the Mysteries. Clement of Alex andria, speaking of the Great Myster ies, says : \"Here ends all instruction. Nature and all things are seen and known moral truths alone been ta ught the Initiate, the Myst eries could never have deserved nor received the magnificent eulogium s of the most enlightened alien of Antiquity,-of Pi ndar, Plutarch, Isocrates, Diodorus, Plat o, Euripides, Socrates, Aristophanes, Cicero, Epicte tus, Marcus Aurelius, and others ;-philosophers hostile to th e Sacerdotal Spir it, or historians devoted to the investigation of Tr uth. No : all the sciences we re taught there ; and those oral on written traditions briefly communicated, wh ich reached back to the first age of the world. Socrates said, in the Phaedo of Plat o: \"It well appear s that those who established the Mysteries, or secret assemblies of the initiated, were no contemptible personages, but men of great genius, who in the early ages strove to teach us, under enigmas , that he who s hall go to the invisible regions without being punfied, will be precipitated into the abyss ; while he who arrives there, purged of t he stains of this world, and accomplis hed in virtue, will be admitted to the dwelling-place of the De ity . The jnitiated are certain to attain the com pany of the Gods.\" Pretextatus, Proconsul of Achaia, a man endowed with all the virtues, said, in the 4th century, that to deprive the Greeks of thos e Sacred Mysteries which bound together the whol e human race, would ma ke life insupportable. Initiation was considered to be a mystical d eath ; a descent into the infernal regions, where every polluti on, and the stains and imperfection's of a corrupt"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"and evil life were purged away by fire and water ; and the perfect Epopt was then said to be regenerat ed, new-born, restored to a renovated existence of life, light, and purity ; and placed under the Divine Protection. A new language was ad apted to these celebrations , and also a language of hieroglyphics, unk nown to any but those who had received the highest Degree. And to them ultimately were confined the learning, the morality, and the political power, of every people among which the Myster ies were practiced. So effectually was the knowle dge of the hieroglyphics of the highest D egree hidden from all but a favored few, that in process of time their meaning was entirely lost, and none could interpre t them. If the same hier oglyphics were employed in the higher as in the lower Degrees, they had a differ ent and more abstruse and figurative meaning. It was pretended, in later time s, that the sacred hieroglyphics and langu age were the same that were used by the Celestial Deities. Everything that could heighten the m ystery of initiation was added, until the very name of the ceremony possessed a strange charm, and yet conjured up the wildest f ears. ache greatest rapture came to be expressed by the word that signified to pass through the Mysteries. The Priesthood possessed one third of Egypt. They gained much of their influence by means of the Mysteries, and spared no means to impress the people with a full sense of their importance. They represent ed them as the beginning of a new life of reason a nd virtue : the initiated, or esoteric companions were said to entertain the most agreeable anticipations resp ecting death and eternity, to comprehend all the hidden mysteries of Natu re, to have their souls restored to the orig inal perfection from which ma n had fallen ; and at their death to be born e to the celestial mansions of the Gods. The doctrines of a future state of rewards and punishments formed a pr ominent feature in the Mysteries; and they were al so believed to assure mu ch temporal happiness and good fortune, and afford abs olute security against the most imminent dangers by land and sea. P ublic odium was cast of those who refused to be initiated. They were considered profane, unwo rthy of public employment or private confidence; and held to be do omed to eternal punishment as impious. To betray the secrets of the Mysteries, to wear on the stage the dress of an Initiate, or to hold the Mysteries up do derision, was to incu r death at the hands of public vengeance. It is certain that up to the time of Cicero, the Mysteries still retained much of their original character of sanctity and purity. An d at a later day, as we know, Nero, after committing a horrible crime, did not dare, even in Greece, to aid in the celebration of the Mysteries ; nor at a still later day was Constantine, the Chri stian Emperor, allo wed to do so, after his murder of his relatives. Everywhere, and in all their forms, the Myster ies were funereal ; and celebrated the mystical death and restoration to li fe of some divine or heroic personage : and the details of the legend and the mode of the death varied in the diff erent Countries where the M ysteries were practiced. heir explanation belongs both to astronomy and mythology, an d the Legend of the Master's Degree is but another form of that of the Mysteries, reaching back, in one shape or other, to the remotest antiquity. Whether Egypt originated th e legend, or borrow ed it from India or Chaldea, it is now impossible to know . But the Hebrews received the Mysteries from the Egyptians; and of course we re familiar with their le gend,-known as it was to those Egyptian Initiates, Joseph and Moses. It was the fable (or rather the"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"truth clothed in all egory and figures) of Osiris, the Sun, Source of Light and Principle of good, and Typhon , the Principle of Darknes s, and Evil. In all the histories of the Gods and Heroes lay couched and hi dden astronomic al details and the history of th e operations of visible Natu re; and those in their turn were also symbols of higher and profounder truths. None but rude uncultivated intellects could long cons ider the Sun and Stars and the Powers of Nature as Divine, or as fit objects of Human Worship; and they will consider them so while the world lasts ; and ever. remain ignorant of the great Spiritual Truths of which these are the hi eroglyphics and expressions. A brief summary of the Egyp tian legend will serve to show the leading idea on which the Mysteries among the Hebrews were based. Osiris, said to have been an ancient King of Eg ypt, was the Sun; and Isis, his wife, the Moon: and his history recounts, in poetic al and figurative style, the annual journey of the Great Luminary of H eaven through the di fferent Signs of th e Zodiac. In the absence of Osiris, Typhon, his brother, filled with en vy and malice, sought to usurp his throne ; but his plans were frustrated by Isis. Then he resolved to kill Osiris. This he did,. by persuading him to enter a coff in or sarcophagus, which he then flung into t he Nile. Alter a Long search , Isis found the body, and concealed it in the dept hs of a forest ; but Ty phon, finding it there, cut it into fourteen pieces, and scattered them hither and thither. After tedious search, Isis found thirteen pieces, the fishes having oaten the other (the privates), which she replaced of wood, and buried the body at Philae; where a temple of surpassing magnificence was erected in honor of Osiris. Isis, aided by her son Orus, Horus or Ha r-oeri, warred agai nst Typhon, slew him, reigned gloriously, an d at her death was reunited to her husband, in the same tomb. Typhon was repres ented as born of the eart h ; the upper part of his body covered with feathers, in stature reaching the cl ouds, his arms and legs covered with scales, serpents darting from him on every side , and fire flashing from his mouth. Horus, w ho aided in slaying him, became the God of the Sun, answering to the Grec ian Apollo; and Typho n is but the anagram of Python, the great serpent slain by Apollo. The word Typhon, like Ev e, signifies a serpent, and life. By its form the serpent symbolizes life, which circulates through all nature. When, toward the end of autumn, the Woman (V irgo), in the constell ations seems (upon the Chaldean sphere) to crush with her heel the he ad of the serpent, this figure foretells the coming of wi nter, during which life se ems to retire from all beings, and no longer to ci rculate through nature. This is why Typhon signifies also a serpent, t he symbol of winter, which, in the Catholic Temples, is represented surrounding the Terrestrial Globe, which surm ounts the heavenly cross, emblem of redempti on. If the word Typhon is derived from Tupoul) it signifies a tree whic h produces apples (mala) evils) , the Jewish origin of the fall of man: Typhon mean s also one who supplants, and signifies the human passions, which expel from our hearts the lessons of wisdom. In the Egyptian Fable, Isis wrote the sa cred word for the instru ction of men, and Typhon effaced it as fast as she wrote it. In morals, his name signifies Pride, Ignorance and Falsehood. When Isis first found the body, where it ha d floated ashore near Byblos, a shrub of Erica or tamarisk near it had, by th e virtue of the body , shot up into a tree around it, and protec ted it; and hence our spri g of acacia. Isis was also aided in her search by Anubis, in the sh ape of a dog. He wa s Sirius or the"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Dog-Star, the friend and counselor of Osiris, and the inventor sf language, grammar, astronomy, surv eying, arithmetic, music, and medical science; the first maker of laws; and who taught the worshi p of the Gods, an d the building of Temples. In the Mysteries, the nailin g up of the body of Osiris in the chest or ark was termed the aphanism) or disa ppearance [of the Sun at t he Winter Solstice, below the Tropic of Capricorn], and the recovery of the diffe rent parts of his body by Isis, the Euresis, or finding. T he candidate went through a ceremony representing this, in all the Mysteries everyw here. The main facts in the fable were the same in all coun tries; and the prominent De ities were everywhere a male and a female. In Egypt they were Osiris and Isis: in India, Mahadeva and Bhavani : in Phoenicia, Thammuz (or Adoni s) and Astarte: in Phry gia, Atys and Cybele: in Persia, Mithras and Asis: in Samothrace and Greece, Dionysu s or Sabazeus and Rhea: in Britain, Hu and Ce ridwen : and in Scandinav ia, Woden and Fr ea: and in every instance these Divinities r epresented the Su n and the Moon. The mysteries of Osiris, Isis, and Horu s, seem to have be en the model of all other ceremonies of initiation subse quently established am ong the different peoples of the worl d. Those of Atys and Cybele, celebrated in Phrygia; those of Ceres and Proserpine, at Eleusis and many other places in Greece, were but copies of them. This we learn from Pl utarch, Diodorus Siculu s, Lactantius, and other writers; and in the absence of direct testim ony should nece ssarily infer it from the similarity of the adventures of these Deities ; for the ancients held that the Ceres of he Gr eeks was the same as the Isis of the Egyptians; and Dionusos or Bacchus as Osiris. In the legend of Osiris an d Isis, as given by Plutar ch, are many details and circumstances other than t hose that we have briefly mentioned; and all of which we need not repeat her e. Osiris married his sister Isis ; and labored publicly with her to ameliorate he lot of men. He taught them agric ulture, while Isis invented laws. He built temples to t he Gods, and establis hed their worship. Both were the patrons of artists and their useful inventions : and .introduced the use of iron for defensi ve weapons and implements of agriculture, and of gold to adorn the temples of the Gods. He went fort h with an army to conquer men to civilization, teaching he people wh om he overcame to plant the vine and sow grain for food. Typhon, his brother, sl ew him when the sun was in the sign of e Scorpion, that is to say, at the Autu mnal Equinox. They had b een rival claimants, says Synesius, for the throne of Egypt, as Light and Darkness co ntend ever for the empire of the world. Plutar ch adds, that at the time when Osiris was slain, the moon was at its full; and therefore it was in the sign opposite the Scorpion, that is, the Bull, the sign of the Vernal Equinox. Plutarch assures us that it was to represent thes e events and details that Isis established the Mysteries, in wh ich they were reproduced by images, symbols, and a religi ous ceremonial, whereby they were imitated : and in which lessons of piety were gi ven, and consolations under the misfortunes that afflict us here below. Those who instituted these Myster ies meant to strengthen religion and console men in their sorrows by the lofty hopes found in a religious faith, whose princi ples were represented to them covered by a pompous ceremonial, and u nder the sacred ve il of allegory. Diodorus speaks of the famous columns erected near Nysa , in Arabia, where, it"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"was said, were two of the tombs of Osiris and Isis. On one was this inscription: \"I am Isis, Quee n of this country. I was in structed by Mercury. No one can destroy the laws whic h I have established. I am the eldest daughter of Saturn, most ancient of the Gods. I am the wife and sister of Os iris the King. I first made known tomortals the use of wheat. I am the mother of Orus the King. In my honor was the city of Bubaste built. Rejo ice, O Egypt, rejoice, land that gave me birth!\" ... And on the other was this : \"I am Osiris the King, who led my armies into al l parts of the wo rld, to the most thickly inhabited countries of India, the North, the Danube, and the Oc ean. I am t he eldest son of Saturn : I was born of the brilliant and magnificent egg, and my substance is of the same nature as that which composes light. There is no place in the Universe where I have not appeared, to bestow my ben efits and make known my discoveries.\" The rest was illegible. To aid her in the search for the body of Os iris, and to nurse her infant child Horus, Isis sought out and took with he r Anubis, son of Osir is, and his sister Nephte. He, as we have said , was Sirius, the brightes t star in the Heavens. After finding him, she went to Byblos, and seated he rself near a fountain; where she had learned that the sacred chest had stopped wh ich contained the body of Osiris. There she sat, sad and silent, shedding a torrent of tears. Thither came the women of the C6urt of Queen Astarte, and she spok e to them, and dressed their heir, pourin g upon it deliciously perfumed ambrosia. This known to the Queen, Isis was engaged as nurse for her child, in the palace, one of the columns of which wa s made of the Erica or tama risk, that had grown up over the chest containing Osiris, cut down by the Ki ng, and unknown to him, still enclosing the chest: which column Isis afterw ard demanded, a nd from it extracted the chest and the body, which, the latter wr apped in thin drapery and perfumed, she carried away with her. Blue Masonry, ignorant of its import, still retains among its emblems one of a woman weeping over a broken column, holding in her hand a branch of acacia, myrtle, or tamarisk, while Time, we are told, stands behind her combing out the ringlets of her hair. We need not repeat the vapid and tr ivial explanation there given, of this repr esentation of Isis, weeping at Byblos, over the column torn from the palace of the living, that contained the body of Osiris, while Horus, the God of Time, pours ambros ia on her hair. Nothing of this recital was historic al; but the whole wa s an allegory or sacred fable, containing a meaning known only to those who we re initiated into the Mysteries. All the inci dents were astronomical, wit h a meaning still deeper lying behind that expl anation, and so hidden by a double veil. The Mysteries in which these incidents were represented and explained, were like those of Eleusis in their object, of which Pausanias, who was initiated, says that the Greeks, from the remotest antiquity, regarded them as the best calculated of all things to lead mental piety : and Aristotle sa ys they were the most valuable of all reli gious instillations, and thus were called mysteries par excellence; and the Temple of Eleusis was regarded as, in some sort , the common sanctuary of the whole earth , where religion had brought together all that was most imposing and most august. The object of all the Myster ies was to inspire men with piety, and to console them in the miseries of lif e. That consolation, so afforded, was the hope of a happier future, and of pasti ng, after death, to a st ate of eternal felicity. Cicero says that the Initia tes not only receiv ed lessons which made life more"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"agreeable, but drew from t he ceremonies happy hopes for the moment of death. Socrates says that those who were so fortunate as to be admitted to the Mysteries, possessed, when dying, the most glorious hopes for eternity. Aristides says that they not only procure the Initia tes consolations in the present life, and means of deliverance from the great weight of their evils, but also the precious ad vantage of passing after death to a happier state. Isis was the Goddess of Sa is; and the famous Feast of Lights was celebrated there in her honor. There were celebrated the Mysteries, in which were represented the death and subs equent restoration to life of the God Osiris, in a secret ceremony and scenic representat ion of his sufferings, called the Mysteries of Night. The Kings of Egypt often exercised the functions of the Priesth ood; and they were initiated into the sacred science as soon as they attained the throne. So at Athens, the First Magist rate, or Archon-King, su perintended the Mysteries.' This was an image of the un ion that existed between th e Priesthood and Royalty, in those early times when legislators and kings s ought in reli gion a potent political instrument. Herodotus says, speaking of the reasons why animals we re deified in Egypt: \"If I were to explain these re asons, I should be led to the disclosure of those holy matters which I particula rly wish to avoid, and wh ich, but from necessity, I should not leave discussed at all.\" So he says, \"The Egyptians have at Sais the tomb of a certain personage, whom I do not think myself permitted to specify. It is behind the Temple of Minerva.\" [The latter, so called by the Greeks, was really Isis, whose was the often-cited enigmatic al inscription, \"I am what was and is and is to come. No mortal hat h yet unveiled me.\"] So again he says: \"Upon this lake ar e represented by night th e accidents which happened to him whom I dare not name. The Egyp tians call them their Mysteries. Concerning these, at the sa me time that I confess myse lf sufficient ly informed, I feel myself compel led to be sile nt. Of the ceremonies also in honor of Ceres I may not venture to speak, further th an the obligations of religion will allow me.\" It is easy to see what was the great obj ect of initiation and the Mysteries ; whose first and greatest fr uit was, as all the ancien ts testify, to civilize savage hordes, to soften their ferocious m anners, to introd uce among them social intercourse, and lead them into a wa y of life more wort hy of men. Cicero considers the establis hment of the EIeusi iiian Mysteries to be the greatest of all the benefits conferred by Athens on other common wealths ; their effects 381 having been, he sa ys, to civilize m en, soften their sava ge and ferocious manners, `and teach th em the true pr inciples of morals, wh ich initiate man into the only kind of life wort hy of him. The same philo sophic orator, in a passage where he apostrophizes Cere s and Proserpine, says t hat mankind owes these Goddesses the first elements of moral life, as well as the first means of sustenance of physical life ; knowledge of t he laws, regulation of morals, and those examples of civilization which have improved the ma nners of men and cities. Bacchus in Euripides says to Pentheus, that his new in stitution (the Dionysian Mysteries) deserved to be known, and that one of its great adv antages was, that it prescribed all impurity : that these were the Myster ies of Wisdom, of which it would be imprudent to speak to persons not init iated : that they were established among the Barb arians, who in that show ed greater wisdom than the"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Greeks, who had not yet received them. This double object, politica l and religious,-one teachi ng our duty to men, and the other what we owe to the Gods; or rather, respec t for the Gods calculated to maintain that which we owe the laws, is found in that well-known verse of Virgil, borrowed by him from the cere monies of initiati on : \"Teach me to respect Justice and the Gods.\" This great lesson, wh ich the Hierophant impressed on the Initiates, after they had witnesse d a representation of the Infernal regions, the Poet places af ter his description of the different punishments suffered by th e wicked in Tartarus, and immediately after the description of that of Sisyphus. Pausanias, likewise, at the close of th e representation of the punishments of Sisyphus and the daughters of Danaus, in the Temple at Delphi, makes this reflection ; that the crime or impiety which in th em had chiefly merited this punishment, was the co ntempt which they had shown for the Mysteries of Eleusis. From this reflection of P ausanias, who was an Initiate , it is easy to see that the Priests of Eleusis, who taught t he dogma of punishm ent in Tartarus, included among the great crim es deserving these punish ments, contempt for and disregard of the Holy Myst eries; whose object was to lead men to piety, and thereby to respect for just ice and the laws, chief objec t of their institution, if not the only on e, and to fvhich t he needs and interest of religion itself were subordinate; sinc e the latter was but a means to lead more surely to the foyer ; for the whole force of religious opinions being in the hands of the legislators to be wiel ded, they were sure of being better obeyed. The Mysteries were not merely simple ill ustrations and the observation of some arbitrary formulas and cere monies ; nor a means of re minding men of the ancient condition of the race prio r to civilization: but th ey led men to piety by instruction in morals and as to a future life; wh ich at a very early day, if not originally, form ed the chief portion of the ceremonial. Symbols were used in the ce remonies, which referred to agriculture, as Masonry has preserved the ear of wh eat in a symbol a nd in one of her words; but their principal reference was to as tronomical phenomena. Much was no doubt said as to the condition of brutalit y and degradati on in which man was sunk before the institution of the Mysterie s ; but the allusion was ra ther metaphysical, to the ignorance of the uni nitiated, than to the wild life of the earliest men. The great object of the Mysteries of Isis, and in general of all the Mysteries, was a great and truly politic o ne. It was to amelio rate our race, to perfect, its manners and morals, and to re strain society by stronger bonds than those that human laws impose. They were the invention of th at ancient science and wisdom which exhausted all its resour ces to make legisl ation perfect ; and of that philosophy which ha s ever sought to secure the happiness of man, by purifying his soul from the passions which can tr ouble it, and asia necessary consequence introduce social disorder. And that they we re the work of genius is evident from their employme nt of all the sciences, a profound knowledge of the human heart, and the m eans of subduing it. It is a still greater mist ake to imagine that they were the inventions of charlatanism, and m eans of deception. T hey may in the laps e of time have degenerated into imposture and schools of fa lse ideas; but they were not so at the beginning; or else t he wisest and best men of an tiquity have uttered toe most willful falsehoods. In process 0f time the very allegories of the"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"Mysteries themselves, Tantalus and its punishments, Minos an d the other judges of the dead. came to be mi sunderstood, and to be false because they were so; while at first they were true, because they were recognized as merely the arbitrary forms in which truths were enveloped. The object of the Mysteries was to procure for man a r eal felicity on earth by the means of virtue; and to that end he was ta ught that his soul was immortal ; and that error, sin, and vice must needs, by an inflex ible law, produce their consequences. The rude repres entations of physical tort ure in Tantalus was but an image of , the cert ain, unavoidable, et ernal consequences t hat flow by the law of God's enactment from the sin co mmitted and the vice indulged in. The poets and mystagogues labored to propagate these doctrines of the soul's immortality and the certain punishment of si n and vice, and to accredit them with the people, by teac hing them the form er in their poems, and the latter in the sanctuaries; and they clothed them with the charms, the one of poetry, and the other of spectacles and magic illusions. They painted, aided by a ll the resources of art, the virtuous man's happy lif.e after death, and the horrors of the frightful prisons destined to punish the vicious. In the shades of the sanctuaries, thes e delights and horrors were exhibited as spectacles, and the Initia tes witnessed religi ous dramas, under the name of initiati on and mysteries. Curiosity wa s excited by secrecy, by tie difficulty experienced in obtaining admission, and by the tests to be undergone. The c andidate was amused by the variet y of the scenery, the pomp of the decorations, the appliances of ma chinery. Respect wa s inspired by the gravity and dignity of the actors and the majesty of the ceremonial ; and fear and hope, sadness and delight, were in turns excited. The Hierophants, men of in tellect, and well understan ding the disposition of the people and the art of co ntrolling them, used every appliance to attain that object, and give importance and impressiveness to thei r ceremonies. As they covered those ceremonies with the veil of Secr ecy, so they pref erred that Night , should cover them with its wings. Ob scurity adds to im pressiveness, and assists illusion; a nd they used it to produce an effect upon t he astonished Initiate. The ceremonies we re conducted in ca verns dimly light ed : thick groves were planted around the Temp les, to produce th at gloom that im presses the mind with a religious awe. The very word mystery, according to Demetrius Phalereus, was a metaphorical expression that denoted the secret awe which dark ness and gloom inspired. The night was almost always t he time fixed for their cele bration ; and they were ordinarily termed nocturnal ceremonies. Initiations into the Mysteries of Samothrace tookplace at night ; as did those of Isis, of which Apuleius speaks. Euripides makes Bacchus say, that his Mysteries were cele brated at night, because there is in night something a ugust and imposing. Noth ing excites men's curiosity so much as Myster y, concealing things which th ey desire to know : and nothing so much increases cu riosity as obstacles that interpose to prevent them frown indulging in the gratif ication of their desires. Of this the Legislators and Hierophants took advantage, to attract the people to their sanctuaries, and to induce them to seek to obtain lessons from whic h they would perhaps have turned away with indifference, if t hey had been pressed upon them. In this spirit of mystery they pr ofessed to imitate the Deit y who hides Himself from"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"our senses, and conceals fr om us the springs by whic h He moves the Universe. They admitted that they concealed t he highest truths under the veil of allegory, the more to e xcite the curiosity of me n, and to urge them to investigation. The secrecy in which they bu ried their Mysterie s, had that end. Those to whom they were confided, bound themselves, by the mo st fearful oaths, never to reveal `them. They were not allowed even to speak of these important secrets with any others than the initiated ; and t he penalty of death was pronounced against any one in discreet enough to reveal them, or found in the Temple without being an Initiate; and any one who had betrayed those secrets, was avoided by all, as excommunicated. Aristotle was accused of impiety, by the Hierophan t Eurymendon, for having sacrificed to the manes of his wife, according to the rite used in the worship of Ceres. He was compell ed to flee to Chalcis ; and to purge his memory from this stain, he directed, by his will, th e erection of a Stat ue to that Goddess. Socrates, dying, sacrific ed to Esculapius, to e xculpate himself from the suspicion of Atheism. A pr ice was set on the head of Diagoras because he had divulged the Secret of the Mysteries. An docides was accused of the same crime, as was Alcibiades, and bo th were cited to answer the charge before the inquisition at Athens, w here the People were the Judges: Aeschylus the Tragedian was accused of having represen ted the Mysteries on the. stage ; and was acquitted only on proving that he had never been initiated. Seneca, comparing Philosophy to init iation, says that the most sacred ceremonies could be known to the adapts alone : but that man of their precepts were known even to the Prof ane. Such 385 was the case with the doctrine of a future life, and a state of rewards and punishments beyo nd the grave. The ancient legislators clothed th is doctrine in the pomp of a mysterious ceremony, in mystic words and magi cal representations, to im press upon the mind the truths they taught, by the strong influence of su ch scenic displays upon the senses and imagination. In the same way they taught the origin of t he soul, its fall to the earth past the spheres and thro ugh the elements, and its final return to the place of its origin, when, during the c ontinuance of its union wi th earthly matter, the sacred fire, which formed its essenc e, had contracted no stains, and its brightness had not be en marred by foreign particles, which, denaturalizing it, weighed it down and delaye d its return. These met aphysical ideas, with difficulty comprehended by the mass of the Initiate s, were represented by figures, by symbols, and by allegorical analogi es; no idea being so abstract that men do not seek to gi ve it expression by, and tr anslate it into, sensible images. The attraction of Secre cy was enhanced by the di fficulty of obtaining admission. Obstacles and susp ense redoubled curiosity. Those who aspired to the initiation of the Sun and in the Mysteries of Mathias in Persia, underwent many trials. `rhey commenced by easy tests and arrived by de grees at those that were most cruel, in which the life of the candidate was often endangered. Gregory Nazianzen terms them tortur es and mystic pun ishments. No one call be initiated, says Suidas, until after he has proven, by the most terrible trials, that he possesses a virtuous soul, ex empt from the sway of every passion, and at it were impassible. There were twelve principal tests; and some make the number larger. The trials of the Eleusini an initiations were not so terrible ; but they were"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"severe ; and the suspense, above all in wh ich the aspirant wa s kept for several years [the memory of which is retained in Masonry by the ages of those of the different Degrees ], or the interval between admissi on to the inferior and initiation in the great M ysteries, was a species of torture to the curiosity which it was desired to excite. Thus the Egyptian Priest s tried Pythagoras before admitting him to kn ow the secrets of the sa cred science. He succeeded, by his incredible patience and the cour age with which he surmounted all obstacles, in obtaining adm ission to their society and receiving their lessons. Among the Jews, the Essenes admitted none among them, until th ey had passed the tests or several Degrees. By initiation, those who before were fellow-citizens only, became brothers, connected by a closer b ond than before, by means. of a religious fraternity, which, bringing men nearer together, united th em more strongly : and the weak and the poor could more read ily appeal for assistance to the powerful and the wealthy, with whom religious association gave them a closer fellowship. The Initiate was r egarded as the favorite of t he Gods. For him alone Heaven opened its treasures. Fortuna te during life , he could, by vi rtue and the favor of Heaven, promise himself afte r death an eter nal felicity. The Priests of the Island of Samothrace promis ed favorable winds and prosperous voyages to those who wer init iated. It was prom ised them that the CABIRI, and Castor and Pollux, the Dio scuri, should appear to them when the storm raged, and give t hem calms and smoo th seas: and th e Scholiast of Aristophanes says that those initiated in the Mysterie s there were just men, who were privileged to escape from great evils and tempests. The Initiate in the My steries of Orpheus, afte r he was purified, was considered as released from the empire of ev il, and transferre d to a condition of life which gave him th e happiest hopes. \"I have emer ged from evils'? he was made to say, “and have attained good.\" Those initiated in the Mysteries of Eleusis believed that the Sun blazed with a pure sp lendor for them alone. And, as we see in the case of Pericles, they flattered themselves that Ceres and Proserpine inspired them and ga ve them wisdom and counsel. Initiation dissipated errors and banished misfor tune and after having filled the heart of man with joy during life, it gave him the most blissful hopes at the moment of da We owe it to the Goddesses of Eleusis , says Socrates, that we do not lead the wild life of the earliest men : and to them are due the flattering hopes which init iation gives us for the mo ment of death and for all eternity. The benefit which we reap from these august ceremonies, says Aristides, is not only present joy, a deliverance and enfranc hisement from the old ills ; but also the sw eet hope which we have in` death of passing to a more fortunate state. And Theon sa ys that partici pation of the M ysteries is the finest of all things, and the source of the greatest ble ssings. The happiness promised there was not limited to this mortal life ; but it extended beyond the grave. There a new life was to commence, during which th e Initiate was to enjoy a bliss without alloy and wi thout limit. The Corybantes promised eternal life to the Initiates of the Myst eries of Cybele and Atys. Apuleius represents Lucius, while still in the form of an a ss, as addressing his prayers to Isis, whom be speaks of as the same as Ceres, Venus, Diana, and Proserpine, and as illumina ting the walls of many ci ties simultaneously with her feminine lustre, and s ubstituting her quivering light for the bright rays of the Sun. She appears to him in his vision as a beau tiful female, \"over whose"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"divine neck her long thick hair hung in graceful ringlets\" A ddressing him, she says, \"The parent of Un iversal nature attends thy call. The mistress of the Elements, initiative germ of generations, Supreme of Deities, Queen of departed spirits, first inhabi tant of Heaven, and uniform type of all the Gods and Goddesses, propitiated by thy prayers, is with thee. She gov erns with her nod the luminous heights of the firmament, the sa lubrious breezes of the ocean; the silent deplorable depths of the shades below ; one Sole Divintiy under mazy forms, worshipped by the diff erent nations of the Eart h under many titles, and with various a re ligious rites.\" Directing him how to proceed, at her festival, to re-obt ain his human shape, she says : \"Throughout the en tire course of the rema inder of thy life, until the very last breath has v anished from thy lips, thou art devoted to my service Under my protection will thy life be happy and glor ious: and when, thy. days being spent, thou shall descend to the shades bel ow, and inhabit the Elysian fields, there also , even in the subterranea n hemisphere, shall thou pay frequent worship fo me, thy propi tious patron : and yet further : if through sedulous obedience, religious devotion to my ministry, and inviolable chastity, thou shall prove thyself a worthy object of divine favor, then shall thou fell the influence of the power that I alone pos sess. The number of thy days shall be prolonged beyond the ordinary decrees of fate.\" In t he procession of the festival, Lucius saw the image of the G oddess, on either side of which were female attendants, t hat, \"with ivory combs in th eir hands, made believe, by the motion of their ar ms and the divesting of t heir fingers, to comb and ornament the Goddess' royal hair.\" Afte rward, clad in line n robes, came the initiated, \"The hair of the wo men was moistened by perfume, and enveloped in a transparent covering; but the men, te rrestrial stars, as it were, of the great religion , were thoroughly shaven, and their bald heads shone exceedingly.\" Afterward came the Priests, in robes of white linen. The first bore a lamp in the form of a boat, emitting fl ame from an orifice in the middle : the second, a smal l altar : the third, a golden palmtree : and the fourth displayed the figure of a left hand, the palm open and expanded, \"representing thereby a symbol of equity a nd fair-dealing, of which the left hand, as slower than the right hand, and more void of skill and craft, is therefore an appropriate emblem.\" After Lucius had, by the gr ace of Isis, recovered hi s human form, the Priest said to him, \"Calamity hath no hold on th ose whom our Goddess hath chosen for her service, and whom her majesty hath vindicated. \" And the peopl e declared that he was fortunate to be \"thus after a manner bo rn again, and at once betrothed to the service of the Holy Ministry.\" When he urged the Chief Priest to initiate him, he was answe red that there was not \"a single one among the initiated, of a mind so degraded, or so bent on his own destruction, as, withou t receiving a special command from Isis, to dare to undertake her ministry rash ly and sacrilegiously, and thereby commit an act certain to bring u pon himself a dreadful injury.\" \"For\" continued the Chief Priest,.” the gates of the shades below, and the care of our life being in the hands of the Goddess,-the ce remony of initiation into the Mysteries is, as it were, to suffer death, with the precarious chance of resuscitation. Wherefore the Goddess, in the wisdom of her divinity, hath been accustomed to select as persons to whom t he secrets of her religion ca n with propriety be entrusted, those who, standing as it were on the utmost limit of the cour se of life they"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"have completed, may through her Prov idence be in a manner born again, and commence the career of a new existence.\" When he was finally to be initiated, he was conducted to the nearest baths, and after having bathed, the Priest first solicited forgiveness of the Gods, and then sprinkled him all over with the clearest and purest wate r, and conducted him back to the Temple; \"where,\" says Apuleius, \"after giving me some instruction, th at mortal tongue is not permitted t0 reveal, he bade me for the succeeding ten days restrain my appetite, eat no animal f ood, and drink no wine.\" These ten days elapsed, the Priest led him into the inmost recesses of the Sanctuary. \"And here, studio us reader,\" he continues \" peradventure thou wilt be suffciently anxious to know all that was said and done, which, were it lawful to divulge, I would' tell thee; and, wert thou permitt ed to hear, thou shouldst know. Nevertheless, althoug h the disclosure would affi x the penalty of rash curiosity to my tongue as well as thy ears, yet will I, for fear thou shouldst be too long tormented with religious longing, and suffe r the pain of protracted suspense, tell the truth notwithstanding. Li sten then to what I shall relate. I approached the abode of dea th; with my foot I pr essed the threshold of Proserpine's Palace. I was transported th rough the elements, and conducted back again. At midnight I saw t he bright light of the su n shining. I stood in the presence of the Gods, the Gods of Heav en and of the Shades below; ay, stood clear and worskipped. A nd now have I told thee such things th at, hearing, thou necessarily canst not under stand ; and being beyond t he comprehension of the Profane, I can enunci ate without co mmitting a crime.\" Afte r night had passed, and the morning had da wned, the usual ceremonies we re at an end. Then he was consecrated by twelve stoles being put upon him, clot hed, crowned with palmleaves, and exhibited to the people. The remai nder of that day was celebrated as his birth day and passed in festivit ies; and on the third day afterward, the same religi ous ceremonies we re repeated, including a religious breakfast, \"followed by a final consummation of ceremonies.\" A year afterward, he was warned to prepare. for init iation into t he Mysteries of \"the Great God, Supr eme Parent of all the ot her Gods, the invincible Osiris.\" \"For,\" says Apuleius, \"although there is a strict connection between the religions of both Deit ies, AND EVEN TH E ESSENCE OF BOTH DIVINITIES IS IDENTICAL, the ceremonies of the re spective initiations are considerably different.\" Compare with this hint the following la nguage of the pray er of Lucius, addressed to Isis ; and we may judge wh at doctrines were taught in the Mysteries, in regard to the Deity: \"O Ho ly and Perpetual Preserver of the Human Race ! ever ready to cher ish mortals by Thy munific ence, and to afford Thy sweet maternal affection to the wretched under misf ortune ; Whose bounty is never at rest, neither by day nor by night, nor throughout the very minutest particle of duration; Thou who stretchest forth Thy health-bearing right hand over the land and over the s ea for the protection of m ankind, to disperse the storms of life, to unravel the inextricable ent anglement of the web of fate, to mitigate the tempests of fo rtune, and rest rain the malignant infilences of the stars,-the Gods in Heaven adore Thee, the Gods in the shades below do Thee homage, tke stars obey Thee, the Diviniti es rejoice in Thee , the elements and the revolving seasons serv e Thee! At Thy nod the Wind s breathe, clouds gather, seeds grow, buds germinate; in obedience to Thee the Earth revolves AND THE SUN GIVES US LIGHT. IT IS THOU WHO GO VERNEST THE UNIVER SE AND TREADEST"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"TARTARUS UNDER THY FEET.\" Then he was initiated into the nocturnal Mysteries of Osiris and Serapis: and afterward into those of Ceres at Ro me: but of the ceremonies in these initiations, Apuleius sa ys nothing. Under the Archons hip of Euclid, bastards and slaves were excluded from initiation ; and the same exclusion obtained against the Materialists or Epicureans who denied Prov idence and consequently the utility of initia tion. By a natural progress, it came at length to be considered that the gates of Elysium would open only for the Initiates, whose souls had been pu rified and regener ated in the sanctuarie s. But it was never held, on the other hand, that initiation alone sufficed. We learn from Plato, that it was also necessary for the soul to be purified from every stain: and that the purification nec essary was such as gave virtue, truth, wisdom, strength, justice, and temperance. Entrance to the Temples was forbidden to all who had commit ted homicide, even if it were involuntary. So it is stated by both Isocrates and Theon. Magicians and Charlatans who m ade trickery a trade, and impos tors pretending to be possessed by evil spirits, were excluded from the s anctuaries. Every impious person and criminal was rejected ; and Lampridius states that before the celebration of the M ysteries, public notice was gi ven, that none need apply to enter but those agains t whom their consciences ut tered no repr oach, and who were certain of t heir own innocence. It was required of the In itiate that his heart a nd hands should be free from any stain. Porphyry says that man's soul, at death, should be enfranchised from all the passions, from ha te, envy, and the others; and , in a word, be as pure as it is required to be in the Mysteries. Of course it is not surprising that parricides and perk jurors, and others who had committed crimes against God or man, could not be admitted. In the Mysteries of Mith ras, a lecture was repeated to the Initiate on the subject of Justice. And the great moral. Lesson of the Mysteries, to which all their mystic ceremonial te nded, expressed in a single line by Virgil, was to practice Justice and revere the Deity, -thus recalling me n to justice, by connecting it with the ju stice of the Gods, who r equire it and punish its infraction. The Initiate c ould aspire to the favors of the Gods, only because and while he respecte d the rights of society and those of humanity. \"The sun,\" says the chorus of Initiate s in Aristophanes, \"burns with a pure light for us alone, who, admitted to the' Mysteries, observe th e laws of piety in our intercourse with strangers and our fellow-citizens.\" T he rewards of initiation were attached to the practice of the, social virtues. It was not enough to be initiated merely. It was necessary to be faithful to the la ws of initiation, which imposed on men duties in regard to their kind . Bacchus allowed none to participate in his Mysterie s, but men who performed to the rules of piety and justice. Sensibility, above all, and compa ssion for the misfortunes of others, were precious virtues, which initiati on strove to enc ourage. \"Nature,\" says Juvenal \"has created us compassionate, since it has endowed us with tears. Sensibility is the most adm irable of our sens es. What man is truly worthy of the torch of the Mysteries; who such as the Priest of Ceres requires him to be, if he regards the misfortunes of others as w holly foreign to himself?\" All who had not used their endeav ors to defeat a conspiracy, and those who had on th e contrary fomented one; those citiz ens who had betrayed"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"their country, who had surr endered an advantageous po st or place, or the vessels of the State, to the enemy; all who had su pplied the enemy with money; and in general, all w ho had come short of their dut ies as honest men and good citizens., were excluded fr om the Mysteries of Eleusi s. To be admitted there, one must have lived e quitably, and with suffcient good fo rtune not to be regarded as hated by the Gods. Thus the Society of the In itiates was, in its princi ple, and according to the true purpose of its institutio n, a society of virtuous men, who labored to free their souls from the tyra nny of the passions, and to develop the germ of all the social virtues, And this was th e meaning of the idea, afterward misunderstood, th at entry into Elysium was onl y allowed to the Initiates : because entrance to the sanctuaries was allowed to the virtuous only, and Elysium was created for virtuous souls alone. The precise nature and de tails of the doctrines as to a future life, and rewards and punishments th ere, developed in the Myst eries, is in a measure uncertain. Little direct information in r egard to it has corme down to us. No doubt, in the ceremonies, there was a scenic represent ation of Tantalus and the judgment of the dead, resembling that which we find in Virgil : but there is as little doubt ihat these repr esentations were explained to be allegorical. It is not our purpose here to repeat the descriptions gi ven We are only concerned with the great fact that the Mysteries taught the doctrine of the soul's immortality, and that, in some shape, suffering, pain, remorse, and agony, ever follow sin as its consequences. Human ceremonies are indee d but imperfect symbols; and the alternate baptisms in fire and iwater intended to purify us into im mortality, are ever in, this world interrupted at the mo ment of their anticipated completion. Life its a mirror which reflects only to deceive , a tissue perpetually. Interrupted and broken, an urn forever fed, yet never ful1. All initiation is but intr oductory to the great ch ange of death. Baptism, anointing, embalming, obsequ ies by burial or fire, ar e preparatory symbols, like the initiation of He rcules before descending to the Shades, pointing out the mental change which ought to prece4e the renewal of existence. Death is the true initiation, to which sl eep is the introductory or minor mystery. It is the final rite which united the Egyptian with his God, and which opens the same promise to all who ar e duly prepared for it. The body was deemed a prison for the soul; but the latt er was not condemned to eternal banishment and impris onment. The Father of the Worlds permits its chains to be broken, and has provided in the course of Nature the means of its escape. It was a doctrine of immemorial antiquity, shared alike by Egyptians, Pythagoreans, the Or phici, and by that characte ristic Bacchus Sage, \"the Preceptor of the Soul ,\" Silence, that death is fa r better than life; that the real death belongs to those who on earth are immersed in the Lethe of its passions and fascinations, and that the true life comm ences only when the soul is emancipated for its return. And in this sense, as presiding over life and death, Di onysus is in the highest sense the LIBERATOR : Since, like Osiris, he fr ees the soul, and guides it in its migrations beyon d the grave, preserving it from the risk of again falling under the slavery of matter or of some inferior animal form, the purgatory of Metempsychosis ; and exalting and perfec ting its nature through the purifying discipline of his Mysteries. \"The gr eat consummation of all"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"philosophy,\" said Socrates , professedly quoting fr om traditional and mystic sources, \"is Death: He w ho pursues philosophy aright, is study ing how to die.\" All soul is part of the Un iversal Soul, whose totality is Dionysus; and it is therefore he who, as Spirit of Spirits, leads back th e vagrant spirit to its home, and accompanies it through the purifying pr ocesses, both real and symbolical, of its earthly thansit. He is therefore em phatically the Mystic or Hierophant, the great Spiritual Mediator of Greek religion. The human soul is itself demonios a God withers the mind, capable through its own power of rivaling the canonization of t he Hero, of making itself immortal by the practice of the g ood, and the contem plation of the bea utiful and true. The removal to t he Happy Islands co uld only be understood mythically; everything earthly must die; Man, like OEdipus, is wounded from his birth, his realm elysium can exist on ly beyond the grave. Dion ysus died and descended to the shades. His passion was the great Secret of the M ysteries ; as Death is the Grand Mystery of existence. His death, typical of Natu re's Death, or of her periodical decay and restor ation, eras one of t he many symbols of the palingenesia or seco nd birth of man. Man descended from t he elemental Forces or Tit ans [Elohim], who fed on the body of the Pantheistic Deity creating the Univer se by self-sacrifice, commemorates in sacramental observance this mysterious passion ; and while partaking of the raw flesh of the victim, seems to be invigorated by a fresh draught from the fountain of unversa l life, to receive a new pledge of regenerated existence. Death is the inseparable an tecedent of life; the seed lies in order to produce t he plant, and earth ishelf is rent asunder and dies at the birth of Dionusos. Hence the signific ancy of the phallu s, or of its inoffensive substitute, the obelisk, rising as an emblem of resurrection by the tomb of buried Deity at Lerna or it Sais. Dionysus-Orpheus descend ed to the Shades to recover the lost Virgin of the Zodiac, to bring back his mo ther to the sky as Thyone ; or what has the same meaning, to consummate his eventful marr iage with Persephone, thereby securing, like the nuptials of his fath er with Semele or Danae, the perpetuity of Nature. His under-earth office is the depression of the year, t he wintry aspect in the alternations of bull and serpent, whose united` series makes up the continuity of Time, and in whirls, physically speaki ng, the stash and dark are ever the parents of the beaut iful and bright. the Mysteries : the human sufferer was consoled by witnessing the severer trials of the Gods; and the vicissitudes of life and death, expressed by apposite symbols, such as the sacrif ice or submission of the Bull, the extinction and re -illumination of the torch, exci ted corresponding emotions of alternate grief and joy, th at play of passion which was present at the origin of Nature, and which acco mpanies all her changes. The greater Eleusini ae were celebrated in the mont h Boedromion, when the seed was buried in the gr ound, and when the year , verging to its decline, disposes the mind to serious reflection. The firs t days of the ceremonial were passed in sorrow and anxious silence, in fasting and expiatory or lustral offices. On a sudden, the scene was chang ed : sorrow and lamentation were discarded, the glad name of Bacchus passed from mouth to mouth, the image of the God, crowned with myrtle and bearing a lighted torch, was borne in ,joyful procession from the Ceramicus to Eleusis, wh ere, during thee ensuing night, the initiation was completed by an imposing revelation. The first scene was in the paonaos, or"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"outer court of the sacred enclosure, where amidst ut ter darkness, or while the meditating God, the star i lluminating the Nocturnal M ystery, alone carried an unextinguished torch, the c andidates were overawed wi th terrific sounds and noises, while they painfull y groped their way, as in the gloom y cavern of the soul's sub lunar mi gration ; a scene justly compar ed to the pa ssage of the Valley of the Shadow of D eath. For by the immutabl e law exemplified in the trials of Psyche, man must pass through the terrors of the under-world, before he can reach the height of Heaven. At length the ga tes of the adytum were thrown open, a supernatural light streamed from th e illuminated statue 395 of the Goddess, and enc hanting sights and sounds, mingled with songs and dances, exalted the communicant to a rapture of supreme felicity, realizing, as far as sensuous imagery c ould depict, the an ticipated reunion with the Gods. In the dearth of direct evidence as to the detail of the ceremonies enacted, or of the meanings connect ed with them, thei r tendency must be inferred from the characteristics of the contemplated deities with thei r accessory symbols and mythi, or from direct test imony as to th e value of the Mysteries generally. The or dinary phenomena of vegetation, the death of the seed in giving birth to the plant, connecting the sublimest hopes with t he plainest occurrences, was the simple yet beautiful formula assu med by the great mystery in almost all religions, from the Zend-A vesta to the Gospel. As Proserpine, the divine power is as the s eed decaying and destroyed; as Artemis, she is the principle of its destructio n ; but Artemis Proserpine is also Core Soteria, the Saviour, who leads the Spirits of Hercules and Hyacin thus to Heaven. Many other emblems were employed in the Mysteries, -as the dove, the my rtle-wreath, and others, all significant of life rising. out of dea th, and of the equivocal condition of dying ye t immortal man. The horrors and puni shments of Tantalus, as des cribed in the Phaedo and the AEneid, with a11 the cere monies of the judgments of Minos, Eacus, and Rhadamanthus, were represent ed, sometimes more and some times less fully, in the Mysteries; in order to impress upon the mi nds of the Initiates this great lesson,-that we shou ld be ever prepare d to appear before the Supreme Judge, with a heart pure and spotless ; as Socrates teac hes in the Gorgias. For the soul stained with cr imes, he says, to descend to the Shades, is the bitterest ill. To adhere to Justice and Wisdom, Plato holds, is our duty, that we may some day take that lofty road that leads toward the heavens, and avoid most of . the evils to which the soul is exposed in its subterranean journey of a thousand years. And so in the Phaedo, Socrates teaches that we should seek here below to free our soul of its passions, in order to be ready to enter our appearance, whenever Destiny summons us to the Shades. Thus the Mysteries inculcated a great moral trut h, veiled with a fable of huge proportions and the app liances of an impre ssive spectacle, to ,which, exhibited in the sanctuaries art and natural magic lent all they had t hat was imposing. They sought to strengthen men against the horrors of death and the fearful idea of utter annihilatio n. Death, says t he author of the di alogue, entitled Axiochus, included in the wo rks of Plato, is but a pa ssage to a happier state; but one must have lived well, to attain that most fort unate result. So that the doctrine of the immortalit y of the soul was consol ing to the virtuous and religious man alone; while to all others it came wi th menaces and despair, surrounding them with\" te rrors and alarms that dist urbed their repose during"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"all their life. For the material horrors of Tantalus, allegorical to the Initiate, were real to the mass of the Profane ; nor in latter times, did, perhaps many Iiiitiates read rightly the allebaory . The triple-walled prison, which the condemned soul first met, round which sw elled and surged the fier y waves of Phlegethon, wherein rolled roaring, huge, blazing rocks ; the gr eat gate with columns of adamant, which none save the Gods could crush; Tisi phone, their warder, with her bloody robes ; the lash resounding on t he mangled bodies of the miserable unfortunates, their plaint ive groans, mingled in ho rrid 'harmony with the clashing of their chains; the Furies, lashi ng the guilty with their snakes; the awful abyss where Hydra howls with its hundred heads, greedy to devour; Tityus, prostrate, and his entrail s fed upon by the cruel vu lture; Sisyphus, ever rolling his rock; Ixion on his wheel; Tantalus tortured by eternal thirst and hunger, in the midst of wate r and with delicious fruits touching his head ; the daughters, of Danaus at their eternal, fruitless task ; beasts biting and venomous reptiles stinging ; and devouring flame eter nally consuming bodies ever renewed in endless agony; all these sternly im pressed upon the people the terrible consequences of sin and vice, and urged them to pur sue the paths of honesty and virtue. And if , in the ceremonies of the Mysteries, thes e material horrors were explained to the Initiate s as mere symbols of the unimaginable torture, remorse, and agony that wo uld rend the immaterial s oul and rack t he immortal spirit, they were feeble and insufficient in the same mode and measure only, as all material images and symbols fall short of th at which is beyond the cognizance of our senses : and the grave Hier ophant, the imagery, the paintings, the dramatic horrors, the fune ral sacrifices, the august rnysteries, the solemn silence of the sanctuaries, were none t he less impressive, because they were known to be but symbols, that ` with material shows and images made the imagination to be the teacher of the intellect. expiation; and the tests of water, air, and flre were represented ; by means of which, during the march of many years, the soul could be pu rified, a nd rise toward the ethereal regions ; that ascent being more or less tedious and laborious, according as each soul wa s more or less clog ged by the gross impediments ,of its sins and vices. Herein was shadowed forth, (how distinctly taught the Initiates we know not), the doctrine that pain and sorrow, misfortune and remorse, are the inevitable cons equences that flow from sin and vice, as effect flows from cause; that by each sin and ever y act of vice the soul drops back and loses ground in its advance to ward perfecti on : and that the ground so, lost is and will be in reality never so recovered as that the sin shall be as if it ne ver had been committed; but that throughout all the eternity of its existence' , each soul shall be consciou s that every act of vice or baseness it did on ea rth has made the distance gr eater between itself and ultimate perfection. We see this truth glimmeri ng in the doctrine, taught in the Mysteries, that though slight and ordi nary offences could be expi ated by penances, repentance, acts of beneficence, and pray ers, grave crimes were mortal sins, beyond the reach of all such remedi es. Eleusis closed her gat es against Nero: and the Pagan Priests told Constant ine that among all their modes of expiation there was none so potent as coul d wash from his soul t he dark spots left by the murder of his wife, and his multip lied perjuries and assassinations."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"The object of the ancien t initiations bei ng to ameliorate mankind and to perfect the intellectual part of man, the nature of the human soul, its origin, its destination, its relations to the body and to universal nature, all formed part of the mystic science; and to them in part the lessons given to the Initiate were directed. For it was believed that initiation tended to his perfection, and to preventing ,the divi ne part within hi m, overloaded with, matter gross and earthy, fr om being plunged into gloo m, and impeded in its return to the Deity. T he soul, with them, was not a mere conception or abstraction ; but a reality including in itself life and thought; or, rather, of whose essence it was to live and think. It was material ; but not brute, inert, inactive, lifeless, motionless, formless, li ghtless matter. -It was held to be active, reasoning, th inking; its natural home in the highest regions of the Universe, whence it de scended to illuminate, give form and movement to, vivify, animate, and carr y with itself the baser matter; and whither it unceasingly tends to reascend, when and as soon as it can fr ee itself from its connection with t hat matter. From that substance, divine, infinitely .delicate and active, essentially luminous, the s ouls of men were formed, and by it alone, uniting with and organizing their bodies, men lived. This was the doctrine of Pythagoras, who learned it when he received the Egyptian Mysteries : and it was the doct rine of all who, by means of the ceremonial of initiation, thought to purify the soul. Virgil makes the spirit of Archives teach it to AEneas: and all the expiations and lustrations vised in the 113`steries were but symbols of those intellectual olies by which the soul was to be purged of its vi ce-spots and stains, and free d of the encumbrance of its earthly prison, so that it might rise unimpeded to the source fr om which it came. Hence sprung the do ctrine of the transmigration of souls; which Pythagoras taught as an allegor y, and those who came after hi m received literally. Plato, like him, drew, his doctrines from the East a nd the Mysteries, and undertook to translate the language of t he symbols used there, into that of Philosophy ; and to prove by argument a nd philosophical deduction , what, felt by the consciousness, the Mysteries taught by Symbols as an indisputable fact,-the immortality of the soul. Ci cero did the same ; and followed the Mysteries in teaching that the Gods we re but mortal men, who fo r their great virtues and signal services had deserv ed that their souls should, after death, be raised to that lofty rank. It being taught in the Mysteries, eit her by way of allegory, the meaning of which was not made known except to a se lect few, or, per haps only at a later day, as an actual reality, that the souls of the vi cious dead passed into the bodies of those animals to whose nature their vices ha d most affinity, it was also taught that the soul could avoid these tr ansmigrations, often successive and numerous, by the practice of virtue, which would acquit it of thrum, free it from the circle of su ccessive generations, and re store it at once to its source. Hence nothing was so ardently prayed far by the Initiates, says Proclus, as this happy fortu ne, which, delivering them from the empi re of Evil, would restore them to thei r true life, and conduct them to the place of final rest. To this doctrine probably referred those figures of animals and monsters which were exhibited to the Initiate, before allowing him to see the sacred light for which he sighed., Plato says, that souls will not reach the term of their ills, until the revolutions of the world have restor ed them to their"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"primitive condition, and purified them fr om the stains which they have contracted by the contagi on of fire, earth, and air. And he held that they could not be allowed to ent er Heaven, until they had distingui shed themselves by the practice of virtue in some one of three seve ral bodies. The Manicheans allowed five: Pindar, the sa me. number as Plato; as did the Jews. And Cicero says, that the anci ent soothsayers, and the inter polators of the will of the Gods, in their reli gious ceremonies and initiati ons, taught that we expiate here below the crimes committ ed in a prior life ; and fo r that are born. It was taught in these Mysteries, that the soul passes' through several states, and that the pains and sorrow s of this life are an ex piation of prior faults. This doctrine of transmi gration of souls obtained, as Porphyry informs us, among the Persians and Ma gi. It was held in the East and the West, and that from the remotest antiquity. Herodotus found, it among the Egyp tians, who made the term of the circle of migrations from one huma n body, through animals, fishes, and birds, to ano ther human body,' three thousand years. Empedocles even held that souls went in to plants Of these, the laur el was the noblest, as of animals the lion; both being consecrat ed to the Sun, to which, it was held in the Orient, virtuous s ouls were to return. The Curds, the Chinese, the Cabbalists, all held the same doctri ne. So Origin he ld, and the Bishop Synesius, the latter of wh om had been initia ted, and who thus prayed to God : \"O Father, grant that my soul, reunited to the light, may not be plunged again into the defilements of earth,\" So the Gnostics held; and even the Disciples of Christ inquired if the man who was born blind, was not so punished for some sin that he had committe d before his birth. Virgil, in the celebrated allegory in which he devel ops the doctrines taught in the Mysteries, enunci ated the doctrine, held b y\" most of the ancient philosophers, of the pre-ex istence of `souls, in the eternal fire from which they emanate; that fire wh ich animates the stars, and circulates in every part of Nature: and the pur ifications of the soul, by fi re, water, and air, of which he speaks, and which three modes were em ployed in the Mysteries of Bacchus, were symbols of the passage of th e soul into different bodies. The relations of the human soul with the rest of nature were a chief object of the science of the Mysteries. The man wa s there brought face to face with entire nature, The world, and the spherical envelope that surr ounds it, were represented by a mystic egg, by the side of the image of the Sun-God whose Mysteries were celebr ated. The famous Orphic egg wa s consecrated to Bacchus in his Mysteries. It was, says Plutarch , an. image of the Universe, which, engenders everything, and contains everyt hing in its bosom.\"`Consult,\" says Macrobius, \"the Init iates of the? Mysteries of Bacchus, who honor with special veneration the sacred egg.\" Th e rounded and almost spheri cal form of its shell, he says, which encloses it on every si de, and confines within itself the principles of life, is a symbolic im age of the world ; and the world is the universal principle of all things. This symbol was borrowed from the Egyptians, who also consecrated the egg to Osiris, germ of Light, himself born, sa ns Diodorus, from t hat famous egg. In Thebes, in Upper Egyp t, he was represented as emit ting it from hi s mouth, and causing to issue from it the first principle of heat and light, or the Fire-God, Vulcan, or Phtha. We find this egg even in Japan, between the horns of the famous Mithriac Bull,- whose at tributes Osiris, Ap is, and Bacchus all borrowed."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Orpheus, author of t he Grecian Mysteries, which he carried from Egypt `to Greece, consecrated this symbol : a nd taught that matter, untreated and informers, existed from all eternity, unorganized, as chaos ; containing in itself the Principles of all Existences confused and interm ingled, light with darkness, the dry with the humid, heat with cold; from which, it after long ages :eking the shape of an immense egg, issued t he purest matter, or First substance, and the residue was divided into the four elements, From which proceeded heaven and earth a nd all things else. This Grand Cosmogonic idea he taught in the Mysteries; and thus the Hierophant expl ained the meaning of the mystic egg, seen by the initiates in the Sanctuary. Thus entire Nature, in her primitive organization, was presented 401 to him whom it was wished to inst ruct in her secret s and initiate in her mysteries ; and Clement of Alexand ria might well say that init iation was a real physiology. So Phanes, the Light-God, in the Mysteries of the Ne w Orphics, emerged from the egg of chaos: and the Persians had the great egg of Ormuzd. And Sanchoniathon tells us that in the Phoenician theology , the matter of chaos took the form of an egg; and he adds: \"Such ,are t he lessons which the Son of Thabion~ first Hiero phant of the Phoenician s,. turned into al legories, in which physics and astronomy inte rmingled, and which he taught to the other Hierophants, whose duty it was to preside at orgies and initiations ; and who, seeking to excite the as tonishment and admir ation of mortals, faithfully transmitted these things to thei r successors and the Initiates.\" In the Mysteries was also taught the division of the Universal Cause into an Active and a Passive cause; of which two, Osiris an d Isis,-the heavens and the earth were symbols. Th ese two .First Causes, into which it was held that the great Universal First Cause at the beginning of things divided itself, were the two great Divinities, whose worship was, according to Varro, inculcated upon the Initiates at Samothrace . \"As is taught,\" he says, \"in the initiation into the Mysteries at Samothra ce, Heaven and Eart h are regarded as the two first Divinities. They are the potent Gods worshipped in that Island, and whose narr4es are consecrated in the books of our Au gurs. One of them is male and the other female; and they bear th e same relati on to each other as the soul does to the body, humidity to dryn ess.\" The Curates, in Cret e, had built an altar to Heaven and to Earth; whose Mysteries they celebrated at Gnossus, in a cypress grove. These two Divinities, the Active and Passive Principles of the Universe, were commonly sym bolized by the generative pasts of man and woman ; to which, in remote ay es, no idea of indecency was attached ; the Phallus and Cteis, emblems of generati on and production, and which, as su ch, appeared in the Mysteries. The Indian Lingam was the uni on of both, as we re the boat and mast and the point within a circle: all of whic h expressed the same philosophical idea as to the Union of the two great Causes of Nature, which concur, one actively and th e other passively, in the gen eration of all beings : which were symbolized by what we now te rm Gemini, the Twos, at that remote period when the Sun was in that Sign at the Vernal Equi nox, and when they were Male and Female; and of which the Phallu s was perhaps taken fr om the generative organ of the Bull, when about twenty-fi ve hundred years before our era he opened that equinox, and became to the Ancient World th e symbol of th e creative"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"and generative Power. The Initiates at Eleusis, commenced, Process says, by invoking the two great causes of nature, the Heav ens and the Earth, on whic h in succession they fixed their eyes, addressing to each a prayer. And they d eemed it their duty to do so, he adds, because they saw in them th e Father and Mother of all generations. The concourse of these two agents of the Universe wa s termed in theological language a marriage. Tertul lian, accusing the Valentinians of having borrowed these symbols from the Mysteries of Eleu sis, yet admits that in those Mysteries they were explained in a manner consistent with decency, as representing the powers of nature. He was too little of a philoso pher to comprehend the sublime esoteric meaning of these embalms, which will, if you advance, in other Degrees be unfolded to you. ` The Christian Fathers c ontented themselves with re viling and ridiculing the use of these emblems. But as they in the earlier' times created no indecent ideas, and were worn alike by the most innocent youths and virtuous women, it will be far wiser for us to seek to penetrate thei r meaning. Not only the Egyptians, says Diodorus Si nuous, but every other people that consecrate this symbol (the Phallus), deem that they ther eby do honor to the Active ,Force of the universal generation of all living things. For the same reason, as we learn from the geographer Ptolemy, it was revered amon g the Assyrians and Persians. Proclus remarks that , in the distribution of the Zodiac among she twelve great Divinities, by ancient astrology, six si gns were assigned to the male and six to the female principle. There is another division of nature, whic h has in all ages st ruck all men, and which was not forgotten in the Mysteries; that of Light and Darkness, Day and Night, Good and Evil ; which mingle with, and clash ag ainst, and pursue or are pursued by eaeh other thro ughout the Universe. T he Great Symbolic Egg distinctly reminded the Initiates of this great division of the world. plutarch, treating of the dogma of a Providence, and of that of the two principles of Light and Darkness, which he regarded as the ba sis of the Ancient Theology, of the Orgies and the Mysteries, as well among the Greeks as the Barbarians,-a doctrine whose origin, according to him, is lost in the night of time,-cites, in support of his opinion, the famous M ystic Egg of the disciples of Zoroaster and the Initiates in the Mysteries of Mithras. To the Initiates in the Mysteries of Eleusis was exhibite d the spectacle of these two principles, in the successive scenes of Darkness and Light which passed before their eyes. To the pr ofoundest darkness, accompanied with illusions and horrid phantoms, succeeded the most brilli ant light, whose splendor blazed round the statue of the Goddess. Th e candidate, says Dion Chrysostomus, passed into a 'mysterious temple, of astonishing magnitude and beauty, where were exhibited to him many mystic scenes; where his ears were stunned with many voices ; and where Dark ness and Light successively passed before him. And Themistius in like mann er describes the Init iate, when about to enter into that part of the sanctuary tenanted by t he Goddess, as filled with fear and religious awe, wavering, uncertain in w hat direction to advance through the profound darkne ss that envelopes him. But when t he Hierophant has opened the entrance to the in most sanctuary, and remo ved the robe that hides the Goddess, he exhibits her to the Initia te, resplendent wit h divine light. The thick `shadow and gloo my atmosphere which had enthroned the candidate vanish ; he is filled with a vivid and gl owing enthusiasm, th at lifts his soul"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"out of the profound dejecti on in which it was , plun ged ; ant the purest light succeeds to the thickest darkness. In a fragment of the same writer, preserved by St obaeus, we learn that the Initiate, up to the moment when his initiation is to be consummated, is alarmed by every kind of sight : that astonishment and terror take his soul captive; he trembles; cold sweat flows from his body; until the mo ment when the Light is shown him,-a most astoundihg Light,-th? brilliant scene of Elysium, where he sees charming meadows over arched by a clear sky, a nd festivals celebrated by dances ; where he hears ha rmonious voices, and the majestic chants of the Hierophants; and vi ews the sacred spectacles. Then, absolutely free, and enfranchised from the dominion of all ills, he mingles wi th the crowd of Initiates, and, crow ned with flowers, ce lebrates with them t he holy orgies,' in the brilliant realms of ether, and the dwelling-pla ce of Ormuzd. In the Mysteries of Isis , the candidate first passed through the dark valley of the shadow of death; then into a place repr esenting the elements or sublunary world, where the two principles clash and contend ; and was finally admitted to a lumin ous region, where the sun, wi th his most br illiant light, put to rout the shades of night. Then he himself put on the costume of the Sun-God, or the Visible So urce o'f Ethereal Light, in whose Myster ies he was initiated ; and passed from the empire of darkness to that of light. After having set his feet on the th reshold of the palace of Pluto, he asce nded to the Empyrean, to the bosom of the Eternal Principle of Li ght of the Un iverse, from which all souls and in telligences emanate. Plutarch admits that this theory of tw o Principles was the basis of all the Mysteries, and consecrated in the religious ceremonies and Mysteries of Greece. Osiris and Typhon, Ormuzd and Ahriman, Bacchus and the Titans and Giants, all represented these principles. Phanes, the luminous God that issued from the Sacred Egg, and Night, bor e the scepters in the Myst eries of the New Bacchus. Night and Day were two of t he eight Gods adored in th e Mysteries of Osiris. The sojourn of Proserpine and also of Adonis, during six mont hs of each year in the upper world, abode of li ght, and six mo nths in the lower or abode of darkness, allegorically represented the sa me division of the Universe. The connection of the-diff erent initiations with the Equinoxes which separate the Empire of the Nights from that of the Days, and fix the moment when one of these principles begins to prevail ov er the other, shows that the Mysteries referred to the continual contest betwe en the two principl es of light and darkness, each alternatel y victor and vanqui shed. The very object proposed by them shows that their ba sis was the theory of the two principles and their relations with the soul. \"We celebrate the august Mysteries of Ceres and Proserpine,\" says the Emperor Julian, \"at the Autumnal Equinox, to obtain of the Gods that the soul ma y not experience t he malignant action of the Power,of Darkness that is then about to have sway and rule in Nature.\" Sallust the Philosopher makes almost the same remark as to the relations of the soul with the periodical march of li ght and darkness, during an annual revo lution ; and assures us that the mysterio us festivals of Greece re lated to the same. And in all the explanations given by Macrobius of the Sacred Fables in regard to the sun, adored under the names of Osiris, Horus, A donis, Atys, Bacchus, etc.. we invariably see that they re fer to the theory of the two Principles, Light and Darkness, and the triumphs gained by one over the other. In April was celebrated the firs t triumph obtained by the ligh t of day over the length of"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"the nights ; and the ceremoni es of mourning and rejoic ing had, Macrobius says, as their object the vicissi tudes of the annual administration of the world. This brings us naturally to the tragic portion of these religious' scenes, and to the allegorical history of the different ad ventures of the Principle, Light, victor and vanquished by turns, in the combats waged with Da rkness during each annual period. Here we reach the most myster ious part of the ancient initiations, and that most interesting to the Maso n who laments the death of his Grand Master Khir-Om. Over it Herodotus throws the august veil of mystery and silence. Speaking of the Temple of Mi nerva, or of that Is is who was styled the Mother of the Sun-God, and whose Mysteries were termed Isiac, at Sais, he specks of a Tomb in the Temple, in the rear of th e Chapel and a gainst the well ; and says, \"It is the tomb of a man, whose name re spect requires me to conceal. Within the Temp le were great obelisks of stone [phalli], and a circular lake paved with st ones and revett ed with a parapet. It seemed to me as large as that at Delos\" [there the Myst eries of Apollo we re celebrated]. \"In this lake the Egyptians celebrate, during the night, what they style the Mysteries, in which are represented the sufferings of the God of whom I have spoken above.\" . This God was Osiris, put to death by Typhon, and who descended to the Shades and was re stored to life; of whic h he had spoken before. We are reminded, by this passage, of the Tomb of Khir-Om, his death, and his rising from the grave, sym bolical of restoration of life ; and also of the brazen Sea in the Temple at Jerusalem. Herodotus adds : \"I impose upon myself a profound, silence in regar d to these Mysteries, wi th most of which I am acquainted. As little will I speak of the initiations of Ceres, known among the Greeks as Thesmophoria. What I shall say will not vi olate the respect which I owe to religion.\" Athenagoras quotes this passa ge to show that not only the Statue but the Tomb of Osiris was exhibited in Egypt, and a tragic representation of his sufferings; and remarks that the Egyptians had mourning ceremonies in honor of their Gods, whose deaths th ey, Lamented ; and to whom they afterward sacrificed as having It is, however, not difficult, combining t he different rays of light that emanate from the different Sanctuar ies, to learn the genius and the object of these secret ceremonies. We have hints, a nd not details. We know that the Eg yptians worshipped th e Sun, under the na me of Osiris. The misfortunes and tragica l death of this God . were an allegory rela ting to the Sun. Typhon, like Ahriman, represented Dark ness. The sufferings and death of Osiris in the Mysteries of the Night were a mystic image of the phenomena of Nature, and the conflict of the two great Pr inciple which share the empire of Nature, and most infilenced our souls. the sun is neither born, dies, nor is raised to life: and the reci tal of these events was bu t an allegory, veiling a. higher truth Horus, son of Isis, and the same as A pollo or the S un, also died and was restored again to, li fe~ and to his mother; and the priests ,of Isis celebrated these great even ts by mourning and joyous festival succeeding each other. In the Mysteries of Phoenici a, established in honor of Thammuz or Adonis, also the Sun, the spectacle of his death and resurrecti on was exhibited to the Initiates. As we learn from Meursius and Plutarch , a figure was exhibited representing the corpse of a young man. Flow ers were strewed upon his body, the women mourned for him ; a to mb was erected to him. And these feasts, as we learn from Plutarch and Ovid, passed into Greece."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"God was lamented, and his resurrecti on was celebrated with the most enthusiastic expressions of joy. A corp se, we. learn from Julian , was shown the Initiates, representin g Mithras dead; and afterw ard his resurrection was announced; and they we re then invited to rejoice t hat the dead God was restored to life, and ha d by means of his sufferings secured their salvation. Three months before, his birth had been celebrated, under the emblem of an infant, born on the.25th of December , or the eighth day before the Calends of January. In Greece, in the mysteries of the same God, honored un der the name of Bacchus, a representatio n was given of his death, slain by t he Titans ; of his descent into hell, his ,subsequent resu rrection, and his return toward his Principle or the pure abode whence he had descended to uni te himself with matter. In the islands of Chios and Ten edos, his death was represented by the sacrifice of a man,` actually immolated. The mutilation and sufferings of the sa me Sun-God, honored in Phrygia under the name of Atys, caused th e tragic scenes that were, as we learn from Diodorus Siculus, represented annually in the Myst eries of Cybele, mo ther of the Gods. An image was borne there, re presenting the corpse of a young man, over whose tomb tears were shed, and to whom funeral honor s were paid. At Samothrace, in the Mysteries of the Cabiri or great Go ds, a representation was given of the death of one if them. This name was given to the Sun, because the Ancient Astronomers gave the name of Gods Cabiri, a nd of Samothrace to the two Gods in the Cons tellation Gemini; whom others term Apollo and Hercules, two names of the Sun.. Athenion says that t he young Cabirus so slain was the same as the Dionysus or Bacchus of the Greeks. The Pelasg i, ancient i nhabitants of Greece, and who settled Samoth race, celebrated these Myst eries, whose origin is unknown : and they worshi pped Castor and Pollux as patrons of navigation. The tomb of Apollo was at Delphi, where his body wa s laid, after Python, the Polar Serpent that annually heralds the coming of aut umn, cold, darkness, and winter, had slain him, and over whom. t he God triumphs, on th e 25th of March, on his return to the lamb of the Vernal Equinox. In Crete, Jupiter Ammon, on the Sun in Aries, painte d with the attributes of that equinoctial sign, the Ram or Lamb ;-that Ammo n who, Martianus Copella says, is the same as Osiris, Adoni, Ad onis, Atys, and the other Sun-Gods,-had also a tomb, and a re ligious initiation ; one of the principal ce remonies of whi`ch consisted in clothing the Initiate with the ski n of a white lamb. And in this we see the origin of the apron of white sheep-skin, used in Masonry. All these deaths and resurrections, these funeral emblems, t hese anniversaries of mourning and joy, these cenotaphs raised in diff erent places to the Sun-God, honored under different nam es, had but a single obj ect, the allegorical narration of the events wh ich happened here below-to t he Light of Nature, that sacred fire from which our souls were deem ed to emanate, warring with matter and the dark Principle resident therein, ever at variance with the Principle of Good and Light poured upon it self by the Supreme Divini ty. All these Mysteries, says Clement of Alexandria, di splaying to us murders and tombs alone, all these religious tragedies, had a co mmon basis, variously or namented : and that basis was the fictitious death an d resurrection of the S un, Soul of the World, principle of life and move ment in the Sublunary Wo rld, and source of our intelligences, which are bu t a portion of the Eterna l Light blazing in that Star, their chief center. It was in the Sun that S ouls, it was said , were purified: and to it they"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"repaired. It was one of the gates of the soul, throug h which the theologians, says Porphyry, say that it re-ascends to ward the home of Li ght and the Good. Wherefore, in the Mysterie s of Eleusis, the Dadouko s (the first officer after the Hierophant, who represen ted the Grand Demiour gos or Maker of the Universe), who was casted in the in terior of the Temple, and there received the candidates, represented the Sun. It was also held t hat the vicissitudes experienced by the Father of Light had an influence on the destiny of souls; which, of the same substance as he, shared his fortunes. This we learn fr om the Emperor Julia n and Sallust the Philosopher. They are afflic ted when he suffers : they rejoice when he triumphs over the Power of Da rkness which opposes his sway and hinders the happiness of Souls, to whom nothing is so terrible as darkness. The fruit of the sufferings of the God, father of li ght and $ouls, slain.by th e Chief of the Powers of Darkness, and again restored to life, was rece ived in the Myster ies. \"His death works your Salvation ;\" said the High Priest of Mithras. That was the great secret of this religious tragedy, and its expected fr uit ;-the resurrection of a God, who, repossessing Himself of His dominion over Darkness, should associate with Him in His triumph those virtuous Soul s that by their purity were worthy to share His glory; and that strove no t against the divine force that drew them to Him, w hen, He had t hus conquered. To the Initiate were also displayed the spectacles of the chief agents of the Universal Cause, and of the distribution of the world, in the detail of its parts arranged in most re gular order. The Universe it self supplied man with the model of the first Temple re ared to the Divinity. The arrangement of the Temple of Solomon, the sym bolic ornaments which formed its chief decorations, and the dress of the High Priest,- all, as Clement of Alex andria, Josephus and Philo state, had reference to ,t he order of the wo rld. Clement informs us that the Temple contained many embl ems of the Seasons, the Su n, the Moon, the planets, the constellations Ursa Major and Mino r, the zodiac, the elements, and the other parts of the world.' Josephus, in his descrip tion of the High Priest's Vestments, protesting against the charge of impi ety brought against the He brews by other nati~ons, for condemning the Heathen Divinities, de clares it false, because, in the construction of the Tabernac le, in the ve stments of the Sacrif icers, and in the Sacred vessels, the whole Wo rld was in some sort represented. Of the three parts, he says, into which the Temple wa s divided, two represent Earth and Sea, open to all men, and the th ird, Heaven, God's dwelli ng-place, reserved for Him alone. The twelve loaves of Shew-bread signif y the twelve months of the year. The Candlestick represented the twelve signs through which the Seven Planets run their courses; and the seven lights, those planet s; the veils, of four colors, the four elements; the tunic of the High Priest, the earth; the Hyacinth, nearly blue, the Heavens ; the. aphid, of four colors, the whole of nature; the gold, Light; the breast-plate , in the middle, th is earth in the center of the world ; the two Sardonyxes, used as cl asps, the Sun and Moon ; and the twelve preci ous stones of the breast-plate arranged by threes, like the Seasons, the twelve months, and the twelve signs of the zodiac. Even the loaves were arranged in two groups of six, like the zodiacal signs above and below the Equator. Clement, the learned Bishop of Alexandria, and Ph ilo, adopt all these explanations. Hermes calls the Zodiac, the Grent Tent,-Tabernaculu m. In the Royal Arch"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Degree of the American Ri te, the Tabernacle has four veils, of different colors, to each of which. Belongs a banner. the colors of the four are White, Blue, Crimson, and Purple , and the banners bear the images of the Bull, the Lion, the Man, ant the E agle, the Constell ations answering 2500 years before our era to the Equino ctial and Solstitial points : to which belong four stars, aldebaran, Regulus, Fomalh aut, and Antares. At each of these veil s there are three words : and to each division of the Zodiac, belongin g to each of these Stars, are three Signs . The four signs, Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius, were termed t he fixed signs, and are appropriately assigned to the four veils. `SO the Cherubi m, according to Clement and Philo,- represented the two hemispheres ; their wings, t he rapid course of the firm ament, and of time which revolves in the Zodiac. \"For the Heavens fly;\" sa ys Philo, speaking of the wings of the Cherubim : which were wi nged representations of the Lion, the Bull, the Eagle, and the M an; of two of which, the human-headed, winged bulls and lions, so many have been found at Nimr od ; adopted as beneficent symbols, when the Sun entered Taur us at the Vernal Equino x and Leo at the Summer Solstice : and when, also , he entered Scorpio, far wh ich, on account of its malignant influences, Aq uila, the eagle was substi tuted, at the autumnal equinox; and Aquarius (the water-bearer) at t he Winter Solstice. So, Clement says, the cand lestick with seven branc hes represented the seven planets, like which the se ven branches were arranged and regulated, preserving that musical proportion and system of harmony of whic h the sun was the centre and connection. They were arranged, says Philo, by threes, like the planets above and those below the su n; between which two group s was the branch that represented him, the mediat or or moderator of the ce lestial harmony. He is, in fact, the fourth in the mu sical scale, as Philo remar ks, and Martianus Capella in his hymn to the Sun. Near the candlestick were other emblems representing the heavens, earth, and the vegetative matter out of whose bosom the vapors arise. The whole temple was an abridged image of the wo rld. There were candlest icks with four branches, symbols of the elements a nd the seasons ; with twel ve, symbols of the signs; and even with three hundred and sixty, the number of days in the year, without the supplementary days. Imit ating the famous Temple of Tyre, where were the great columns consecrated to the winds and fire, the Tyrian artist placed two columns of bronze at the entrance of the porc h of the temple. The hemispherical brazen sea, supported by fo ur groups of bulls, of th ree each, looking to the four cardinal points of the compass, repr esented the bull of the Vernal Equinox, and at Tyre were co nsecrated to Astarte; to whom Hiram, Josephus says, had built a temple, and who wore on her head a helmet bearin g the image of a bull. And the throne of Solomon, with bulls adop ting its arms, an d supported on lions, like those of Horus in Egypt and of the Sun at Tyre; likewise referred to the Vernal Equinox and Summer Solstice. Those wh o in Thrice a dored the sun, under the name of Saba Zeus, the Gr ecian Bacchus, blinded to him, says Macrobius, a temple on Mount Zelmisso , its round form r epresenting the world and the sun. A circular apertu re in the roof admitted the light, and introduced the image of the sun into the body of the sanc tuary, where he seemed to blaze as in the heights of Heav en, and to dissipate the darkness with in that temple which was a representation symbol of the world. Ther e the passion, death, and resurrection of Bacch us were represented."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"So the Temple of Eleusis wa s lighted by a window in the roof. The sanctuary so lighted, Dion compares to the Universe, from which he says it diff ered in size alone; and in it the gr eat lights of nature played a great part and were myopically represented. T he images of the Sun, Moon, and Me rcury were represented there, (the latter the same as Anubis who accompanied Isis) ; and they are still the three li ghts of a Masonic Lodge ; e xcept that for Mercury, the Master of the Lodge ha s been absurdly substituted. Eusebius names as t he principal Ministers in the Mysteries of Eleusis, first, the Hierophant, clothed with the attributes of the Gra nd Architect (Demiourgos) of the Universe. After hi m came the Dadoukos, or torch-bearer, representative of the Sun : then the al tar-bearer, repres enting the Moon : and last, the Hieroceryx, bearing the ca duceus, and representi ng Mercury. It was not permissible to reveal the different emblems and the mysterious pageantry of initiation to the Profan e; and therefore we do no t. know the attributes, emblems, and ornaments of these and other officers ; of which Apuleius and Pausanias dared not speak. We know only that everythi ng recounted there was ma rvelous; everything done there tended to astonish th e Initiate: and that eyes and ears we re equally astounded. The Hierophant, of lofty height, and noble fe atures, with long hair, of a great age, grave and dignified, with a voice sweet and sonorous, sat upon a throne, clad in a long trailing robe; as the Motive-God of Nature was held to be enveloped in His work an d hidden under a veil whic h no mortal can raise. even his name was concealed, like that of the Demiourgos, whose name was ineffable. The Dadoukos also wore a long robe , his hair long, and a bandeau on his forehead. Callias, when holding that office, fi ghting on the great day of Marathon, clothed with the insignia of his office, was taken by the Barbarians to be a King. The Dadoukos led the procession of the Initiates, and was charged with the purification. WE do set know the functions of the Ep ibomos or assistant at the altar, who represented the moon. That planet was one of the two ho mes of souls, and one of the two great gates by which they de scended and reascended. Mercury was charged with the conducting of souls through the tw o great gates; and in going from the sun to the moon they passed im mediately by him. He admi tted or rejected them as they were more or less pu re, and therefore the Hieroc eryx or Sacred Herald, who represented Mercury, was c harged with the duty of excluding t he Profane from the Mysteries. The same offsets are found in the procession of Init iates of Isis, described by Apuleius. All clad in robes of white linen, draw n tight across the breast, and close-fitting down to th e very feet, came, first, one bearing a lamp in the shape of a boat; se cond, one carrying an altar; and third, one carrying a golden palm-tree and t he caduceus. These are ihe same as the three officers at Eleusis, after the Hieroph ant. Then one carrying an op en hand, and pouring milk on the ground from a golden vessel in the shape of a woman's breast. The hand was that of justice: and the milk alluded to the Galaxy or Milky Way, along which souls descended and remounted. Two others fo llowed, one bearing a winnowing fan, and th e other a water-vase; symbols of the purification of souls by air and water; and the third purification, by eart h, was represented by an image of the animal that cultivates it , the cow or ox, borne by another officer."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Then followed a chest or ar k, magnificently ornamented, containing an image of the organs of generation of Osiris, or perhaps of bo th sexes ; em blems of the original generating and pro ducing Powers. When Typhon, said the Egyptian fable, cut up the body of Osiris into pieces, he flung his genital s into the Nile, where a fish devoured them . Atys mutilated himself, as his Priests afterward did in imitation of him; and Adonis was in that part of his body wounded by the boar: all of which repres ented the loss by the S un of his vivifying and generative power, w hen he reached the Autumnal E quinox (the Scorpion that on old monuments bites those parts of the Vernal Bull ), and descended toward the region of darkness and Winter. Then, says Apuleius, came \"one who carried in his bosom an object that rejoiced the heart of the bearer, a venerable effigy of the Supreme Deity, neither bearing resemblance to man, cattle, bird, beas t, or any living creature : an exquisite invention, venerable from the novel or iginality of the fashioning; a wonderful, i neffable symbol of religious mysteries, to'be looked upon in profound silence. Such as it was, its figure wa s that of a small urn of burnished gold, ho llowed very ,artisti cally, rounded at the bottom, and covered all over the outside with the wonderful hieroglyphi cs of the Egyptians. The spout was not elevated, but extended laterally, projecti ng like a long rivulet; while on the opposite side was the handle, which, with similar lateral extension, bore on its summit an as p, curling its body into folds, and stretching upward, its wrinkl ed, scaly, swol len throat.\" The salient basilisk, ,or ro yal ensign of the Pharaoh s, often occurs on the monuments-a serpent in folds, with hi s head raised erect a bove the folds. The basilisk was the Phoenix of the serpent-tribe; and the vase or urn was probably the vessel, shaped like a cu cumber, with a projecting sp out, out of which, on the monuments of Egypt, the priests are represented pouri ng streams of the Cruz ansasta or Tau Cross, and of scepters, over the kings. In the Mysteries of Mithra s, a sacred cave, represen ting the whole arrangement of the world, was used for the recepti on of the Initiates. Zoroaster, says Eubulus, first introduced this custom of consecrati ng caves. They were also consecrated, in Crete, to Jupiter; in Arcadia, to, t he Moon and Pan; and in the Island of Naxos, to Bacchus . The Persians, in the cave where the Mysteries of Mithras were celebrat ed, fixed the seat of . that God, Father of Generation, or Demiourgos, near the equinocti al point of Spring, with the Northern portion of the world on his right, and th e Southern on his left. Mithras, says Porphyry, presided over the Equinoxes, seated on a Bull the symbolical animal of the Demiourgos, and bearing a sword. T he equinoxes were the gates through which so uls passed to and fro, between the hem isphere of light and that of darkne ss. The milky way was also represented, passing near each of these gates: and it was, in the ol d theology, termed the pathway of souls. It is, according to Pythagoras, vast troops of souls that form that luminous belt. The route fo llowed by souls, according to Porphyry, or rather their progressive march in the world, lying through the fixed stars and planets, the Mithriac ca ve not only displayed the zodiacal and other constellations, and marked gat es at the four equinoctial and Solstitial points of the zodiac, whereat souls enter into and esca pe from the world of generational and throu gh which they pass to and fro between the real ms of light and darkness; but it represented the seven planetar y spheres which they needs must traverse, in descending from the heaven of the fixed stars to the elements"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"that envelop the earth ; and seven gates were mark ed, one for each. planet, through which they pass, in descending or returning. We learn this from Celsus , in Origen; who says that the symbolical image of this passage among the star s, used in the Mithriac Mysteries, was a ladder, reaching from earth to Heav en, divided into seven steps or stages, to each of which was a gate, and at the summit an eighth, that of t he fixed stars. The first gate, says Celsus, was that of Sa turn, and of lead, by the heavy nature whereof his dull slow progre ss was symbolized. The second, of tin, was that of Venus, symbolizing her soft splendor and easy flexibility. Th e third, of brass, was that of Jupiter, emblem of his solidity an d dry nature. The fourth, of iron, was that of Mercury, expressing his indefatigable acti vity and sagacity. The ,fifth, of copper, was that of Mars, expressive of his inequalities and variable nature. The sixth, of silver, was that of t he Moon: and the seventh, of gold, that of the Sun. This order is not the real order ,of these Planet's but a mysterious one, like that of the days of the We ek consecrated to them, commencing with Saturday, and retrograding to Sunday. It was dictated, Celsus says, by certain harmonic rela tions, those of the fourth. Thus there was an intimate connection between the Sacred Science of the Mysteries, and ancient astr onomy and physics ; and the grand spectacle of the Sanctuaries was that of th e order of the re nown Universe, or the spectacle of Nature itself, surrounding the soul of the Initiate, as it surrounded it when it first descended through the planetary gates, and by the equinoctial and Solstitial doors, al ong the Milky Way, to be for the first time immured in its prison-house of matter. But the Mysteries also represen ted to the candidate, by sensible symbols, the invisible forces which move this visible Universe, and the virtues, qualities, and powers attached to matter , and which maintain the marvellous order observe d therein. Of this Porphyry informs us. The world, according to the philosophers of anti quity, was not a purely material and mechanical machine. A great Soul, diffus ed everywhere, vivified all the members of the imme nse body of the Universe ; and an Intelligence, equally great, directed all its movements, and mainta ined the eter nal harmony that resulted therefrom. Th us the Unity of the Univ erse, represented bv the symbolic egg, contained in itself two units the S oul and the Intelligence, which pervaded all its parts : and they were to the Univ erse,' considered as an animated and intelligent bein g, what intelligence and t he soul of li fe are to the individuality of man. The doctrine of the Unity of God, in this sense, was taught by Orpheus. Of this his hymn or palinode is a proof ; fragments of which are quoted by many of the Fathers, as Justin, Tatian, Clemen s of Alexandria, Cy ril, and Theodoret, and the whole by Eusebius, quoting from Aristobulus. Th e doctrine of the Locos (word) or the Noos (int ellect), his incarnation, death, resurrection or transfiguration ; of his union with matter, his division in the visible world, which he pervades, his retu rn to the original Unit y, and the whole theory relative to the origin of the soul and its desti ny, were taught in the Mysteries, if which they were the , gr eat object. The Emperor Julian explains the Mysteries of Atys and Cybele by the same metaphysical principles, respecting the demiurgical Intellig ence, its descent into matter, and its return to its origin: and ext ends this explanation to those of Ceres. And so li kewise does Sallust the Ph ilosopher, who admits in God a secondary intelli gent Force, which descends into the generative matter to"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"organize it. These mystic al ideas naturall y formed a part of the sacred doctrine and of the ceremo nies of initiations the object of which, Sallust remarks, was to unite man with the World and the Deity, and the final term of perfection whereof was, acco rding to Clemens, the contemplation of nature, of real beings, and of causes. The definition of Sallust is correct. The Mysteries were practiced as a means of perfecting the souls of ma king it to know its own dignity, of reminding. It of its noble origin and immortality, and consequently of its relations with the Universe and the Deity. What was meant by real beings, was invisible bein gs, genii, the faculties or powers of nature ; everyt hing not a part of the vi sible world, which was called, by way of oppositi on, apparent existence. Th e theory of Genii, or Powers of Nature, and its Forces, personi fied, made part of the Sacred Science of initiation, and of that religious spectacle of diff erent beings exhibited in the Sanctuary. It resu lted from that belief in the providence and superintendence of the Gods, which was one of the prim ary bases of initiation. The administration of the Universe by Subaltern Geni i, to vihom it is confided, and by whom good and evil are dispensed in the world, was a consequence of this dogma, taught in the Myster ies of Mithias, where was shown th at famous egg, shared between Ormuzd and Ahriman, each ,of whom commissioned twenty-four Genii to dispense the good and evil found therein; they bei ng under twelve Superior Gods, six on the side of Li ght and Good, and six on that of Darkness and Evil. This doctrine of the Ge nii, depositaries of the Universal Provedence, was intimately connected with the Ancient Myster ies, and adopted in the sacrifices and initiations 'both of Gree ks and Barbarians. Plutarch says that the Gods, by means of Genii, who are intermediates between them and men, draw near to mortals in the , ceremonies of initiation, at which the Gods charge them to assist, and to distribute punishment and blessing. T hus not the Deity, but His ministers, or a Principle and Power of Evil , were deemed the authors of vice and sin and suffering: and thus the Genii or angels differed in character like men, some being good and so me evil; some Celestial Gods, Archangels, Angels, and some Infernal Gods, De mons and fallen Angels. At the head of the latter was their Chief, Ty phon, Ahriman, or Shaitan, the Evil Principle ; who, havi ng wrought disorder in natur e, brought troubles on men by land and sea, and caused the great est ills, is at la st punished for his crimes. It was these events and incidents, says Plutar ch, which Isis desired to represent in the ceremonial ,of the Mysteries, establis hed by her in memory of her sorrows and wanderings , whereof she exhibited an image and repr esentation in her Sanctuaries, where also were afforded encouragements to piety and consolation in misfortune. The dogma of a Providence , he says, administering the Universe by means of intermediary Powers, who ma intain the connection of man with the Divini ty, was eonsecrated in the hl ysteries of the Egyptians, Phrygians, and Thracians, of the Magi and th e Disciples of Zoroaster; as is plain by their initiations, in which mournful and funereal cere monies mingled. It was an essential part of the lessons given the Initia tes, to teach them the relations of their own s ouls with Universal Nature, the greatest lessons of all, meant to dignify ma n in his own eyes, and te ach him his place in the Universe of things. Thus the whole system of the Universe was displaye d in all its parts to the eyes of the Initiate ; and the sym bolic cave which reps resented it was adorned and clothed with all the attributes of that Universe. To this world so"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"organized, endowed with a double forc e, active and passi ve, divided between light and darkness, moved by a living and intell igent Force, governed by Genii or Angels who preside over its different parts, an d whose nature and character are more lofty or low i# proportion as they possess a greater or less portion of dark matter,-to this world descends the soul, emanation of the ethereal fire, and exiled from the lu minous region above the wo rld. It enters into this dark matter, wherein the host ile principles, each seco nded by his troops of Genii, are ever in convict, there to submit to one or more organizations in the body which is its prison, until it shall at last return to its place of origin, its true native country, from which daring this life it is an exile. But one thing remained,-to represent its return, th rough the constellations and planetary spheres, to its original home. T he celestial fire, the philosophers said, soul of the world and of fire, an unive rsal principle, circulating above the Heaven s, in a region infinitely pure and whol ly luminous, itself pure, simple, and unm ixed, is above the world by its specific lightness. If any part of it (say a human soul) descends, it acts ag ainst its nature in doing so, urged by an inco nsiderate desire of the in telligence, a perfidious love for matter which causes it to de scend, to know what passes here below, where good and evil are in conflict. The Soul, a si mple substance, when unconnected with matter, a ra y or partscle of the Divine Fire, whose home is in Heaven, ever turns toward that home , while united with the body, and struggles to return thither. Teaching this, the Mysteries strove to recall man to his divine origin, and point out to him the means of returning thither. The grist science acquired in the Mysteries was knowledge of man's self, of the nobl eness of his origin, the grandeur of his destiny, and his superiority over the animals, which can never acquire this knowledge , and whom he resemb les so long as he does not reject upon his existence and sound t he depths of hi s own nature. By doing and suffering, by virtue and pi ety and good deeds, the soul was enabled at length to free itself from the body, an d ascend along the path of the Milky Way, by the gate of Capricorn and by the seven sphe res. to the place whence by many graduatio ns and successive lapses and enthrallments it had descended. And thus the theory of the spheres, and of the signs and intelligences which presi de there, and the whole system of as tronomy, were connected with that of t he soul and its destiny; and so were taught in the Mysteries, in which we re developed the great pr inciples of physics and metaphysics as to the orig in of the soul, its cond ition here below, its destination, and its future fate. The Greeks fix the date of the establishment of the Mysteries of Eleusis at the year 1423 B. C., duri ng the reign of Erechtheus at Athens. According to some authors, they were instituted by Ceres herself ; and according to others, by that Monarch, who brought them from Eg ypt, where, accordin g to Diodorus of Sicily, he was born. Anothe r tradition was, that Orp heus introduced them into Greece, together with the Dionysian ceremonies, copy ing the latter from the Mysteries of Osiris, and the former from those of Isis. Nor was it at Athens only, that th e worship and Mysteries of Isis, metamorphosed into Ceres, were establis hed. The Boeotians wo rshipped the Great or Cabiric Ceres, in t he recesses of a sacred gr ove, into which none but Initiates could enter; and the ceremoni es there observed, and the sacred traditions of their Mysteries, were connected with those of the Cabiri in"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"Samothrace. So in Argos, Phocis, Arc adia, Achaia, Messenia, Cori nth, and many other parts of Greece, the Mysteries we re practiced, revealing ev erywhere thei r Egyptian origin and everywhere havi ng the same general featur es; but those of Eleusis, in Attica, Pausanias info rms us, had been regarded by the Gr eeks, from the earliest times, as being as far superior to all the ot hers, as the Gods are to mere Heroes. Similar to these were the Mysteries of Bona Dea, the Good G oddess, whose name, say Cicero and Plutarch, it was not permitted to any m an to know, celebrated at Rome frorm the earliest time s of that city. It was th ese Mysteries, practiced by women alone, the secrecy of which was impiously violated by Claudius. They were held at the Kalends of May; and, according to Plutarch, much of the ceremonial greatly re sembled that of the Mysteries of Bacchus. The Mysteries of Venus and Adonis belonged prin cipally to Syria and Phoenicia, whence they passed into Greece and Sicily. Venus or Astarte was the Great Female Deity of the Phoenici ans, as Hercules, Melkarth or Adoni was their Chief God. Adoni, called by the Greeks Adonis, was the lover of Venus. Slain by a wound in the thigh inflict ed by a wild boar in the c hase, the flower called anemone sprang from his bl ood. Venus received the corpse and obtained from Jupiter the boon that her lover should t hereafter pass six mont hs of each year with her, and the other si x in the Shades with Proserpine; an allegorical description of the alternate residence of the Sun in the tw o hemispheres. In these Mysteries his deat h was represented and moun ted, and after this maceration and mourning were concluded, his resurrecti on and ascent to Heaven were announced. Ezekiel speaks of the festiv als of Adonis und er the name of those of Thammuz, an Assyrian Deity, whom ev ery year the women mourned , seated at the doors of their dwellings. These Myst eries, like the others, were celebrated in the Spring, at the Vernal Eq uinox, when he was restored to life; at which time, when they-were inst ituted, the Sun (Adon i, Lord, or Master ) was in the Sign Taurus, the domicile of Venu s. He was represented with horns, and the hymn of Orpheus in his honor styles him \"the two-horned God ;\" as in Argos Bacchus was represented with t he feet of a bull. Plutarch says that Adonis and Bacchus were regarded as one' and the same Deity; and that this opinion was founded on the great similarity in very many respects between t he Mysteries of these two Gods. The Mysteries of Bacchus were known as the Sabazian, Orph ic and Dionysian Festivals. They went back to the remotest antiquity among the Greeks, and were attributed by some to Bacchus hims elf, and by others to Orpheus. The resemblance in ceremonial between the observances established in honor of Osiris in Egypt, and thos e in honor of Bacchus in Greece, the mythological traditions of the tw o Gods, and the symbols used in the festivals of each, amply prove their identity . Neither the name of Bacc hus, nor the word orgies applied to his feasts, nor the sacred words used in his Mysteries, are Greek, but of foreign origin. Bacch us was an Oriental Deity, worshipped in the East, and his orgies celebrated there, long before the Greeks adopted th em. In the earliest times he was worshipped in India, Arabia, and Bavaria. He was honored in Greece wi th public festival s, and in simple or complicated Mysteries, varying in ceremonial in vari ous places, as was natural, because his"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"worship had come thither from different countries and at di fferent periods, The people who celebrated the complicated Mysteries we re ignorant of the meaning of. many words which they us ed, and of many embalms wh ich they revered. In the Sabazian Feasts, for example [from Saba-Zeus, an oriental name of this Deity], the words EVOI, SABO I, Were used, which are in now ise Greek; and a serpent of gold was thrown into the bosom of the In itiate, in allusion to the fable that Jupiter had, in the form of a serpent, had co nnection with Proserpine, and begotten Bakchos, the bull ; whence the enigmatical sa ying, repeated to the Initiates, that a bull e ngendered a dragon or serpent, and the se rpent in turn engendered the bull, w ho became Bakchos : the meaning if which was, that the bull [Taurus, which then ope ned the Vernal Equinox, and the Sun in which Sign, figuratively represented by the Sign itself, was Ba kchos, Dionysus, Saba-Zeus, Osiris, etc.], and the Serp ent, another constellation, occupied such relative positions in the Heavens, that when one rose the other set, and vice versa. The serpent was a familiar symbol in the Mysteries of Bakchos. The Initiates grasped them with their hands, as Orphiuc us does on the cele stial globe, and the Orpheo-telestes, or purifier of candidates di d the same, crying, as Demosthenes taunted. AEschines with doin g in public at the head of the women whom his mother was to imitate, EVOI, SAB0I, HYES ATTE, ANTE, HYES! The Initiates in these Myst eries had preserved the ritu al and ceremonies that accorded with the simplici ty of the earliest ages, and the manners of the first men. The rules of Pythagor as were followed there. Li ke the Egyptians, who held wool unclean, they buried no Initiate in wool en garments. They abstained from bloody sacrifices; and lived on fruits or vegetables or inanimate things. They imitated the life of the contemplative Sects of the Orient; thus approximating to the tranquility of the first men, who lived exempt from trouble and crimes in the bosom of a profound peace. One of the most pr ecious advantages promised by their initiation wa s, to put a man in communion with the Gods, by purifying his soul of all the passion s that interfere with th at enjoyment, and dim the rays of divine light that are communicat ed to every soul ca pable of receiving them, and that imitate thei r purity. One of the degrees of initiation was the state of inspiration to wh ich the adapts were claimed to attain. Th e Initiates in the Mysteries of the Lamb, at Pepuza, in Phrygia, profess ed to be inspired, and prophesied and it was claimed that the soul, by means of these religious ceremonies, purified of any stain, could see th e Gods in this life, and certainly, in all cases, af ter death. The sacred gate s of the Temple, where the ceremonies of initiation we re performed, were opened but once in each year, and no stranger was ever allow ed to enter. It. night th rew her veil over these august Mysteries, which c ould be revealed to no, one. There the sufferings of Bakchos were represented, w ho, like Osiris, died, desc ended to hell and rose to life again; and raw flesh was distributed to the Initiates, which each ate, in memory of the death df the Deity, torn in pi eces by the Titans. These Mysteries also were celebrated at the Vernal Eq uinox; and the emblem of generation, to express the active energy and generative power of the Divinity, was a principal symbo l. The Initiates wore garland s and crowns of myrtle and laurel. In these Mysteries, the as pirant was kept in terror and darkness to perform the three days and nights; and was then made Afa?i smos , Of Ceremony representing the death of Bakchos, the same mythologi cal personage with Osiris. This was effected by coff ining him in a close cell , that he might seriously"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"reflect, in solitude and darkness, on the business he wa s engaged in : and his mind be prepared for the recept ion of the sublime and mysterious truths of primitive revelation and philosophy. This was a symbolic death ; the deliverance from it, regeneration ; afte r which he was called difn?s or twin-born. While confined in the cell, the pursuit of Typhon after the mangled body of Osiris, and the search of Rhea or Isis for t he same, were enacted in his hearing; the initiated crying aloud the name s, of that Deity derived from the Sanskrit. Then it was announced that the body was found ; and the aspirant was liberated amid shoots of joy and exultation. Then he passed th rough a representation of Hell and Elysium. \"Then,\" said an ancient writer, \"they are ent ertained with hymns and dances, with the sublime doctrines of sacred know ledge, and with wonderfu l and holy visions. And now become perfect and initiate d, they are FREE, and no longer under restraint ; but, crowned, and triu mphant, they walk up and down the regions of the blessed, converse with pure and holy men, a nd celebrate the sacred Mysteries at pleasure.\" They were tau ght the nature and ob jects of the Mysteries, and the means of making themselves known, and re ceived the name of Epopts; were fully instructed ie the nature an d attributes of the Divini ty, and the doctrine of a future state; and made acqu ainted with the unity and attributes of the Grand Architect of the Universe, and the true meanin g of the fables in regard to the Gods of Paganism: the great Truth being often procla imed, that \"Zeus is the primitive Source of all things; there is one God; one power, and o ne rule over all.\" And after full ex planation of the many symbols and emblems that surrounded them, they were dismissed with the barbarous word s Kog? Ompa?, corruptions of the Sanskrit words, Kanska Aom Pakscha; meaning, object of our wishes, God, Silence, or Wo rship the Deity in Silence. . Among the emblems used was the rod of Bakchos; which once, it was said, he cast on the ground, and it became a ser pent; and at another time he struck the rivers Orontes and Hy daspes with it,. and the waters receded and he passed over dry-shod. Water was obtained, during the ceremonies, by striking a rock with it. The Bakchae crow ned their heads with serpents, carried t hem in vases and baskets, and at the Evehoi s, or finding, of the body of Osiris, cast one, alive, into the aspirant's bosom. The Mysteries of Atys in Ph rygia, and those of Cybele his mistress, like their worship, much resembled those of Adonis and Bakch os, Osiris and Isis. Their Asiatic origin is universa lly admitted, and was with gr eat plausibility claimed by Phrygia, which contest ed the palm of anti quity with Egypt. They, more than any other people, mingled allegory with their. reli gious worship, and were great inventors of fables ; and their sacred traditi ons as to Cybele and Atys, whom all admit to be Phrygian Gods, were very various. In all, as we learn irom Julius Firmicus, they represented by allegory the ph enomena ,of nature, and the succession of physical fact s, under the veil of a marvelous history. Their feasts occurred at th e equinoxes, commencing wi th lamentation, mourning, groans, and pitiful cries fo r the heath of Atys; and e nding with rejoicings at his restoration to life. We shall not recite the different vers ions of the legend of Atys and Cybele, given by Julius Firmicus, Diodorus, Ar nobius, Lactantius, Servius, Saint Augustine, and Pausanias. It is enough to say that it is in substance this: that Cybele, a Phrygian Princess, who in vented musical inst ruments and dances, was enamored of Atys, a y outh; that either he in a fit of frenzy mutilated"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"himself or was mutilated by her in a paroxysm of jealousy ; that he died, and afterward, like Adonis, wa s restored to life.' It is the Phoenician fiction as to the Sun-God, expressed in other terms, under ot her 'forms, and with other names.' Cybele was wors hipped in Syria, under the name of Rhea. Lucian says that the Lydian Atys there es tablished her wors hip and built her temple. The name of Rhea is also found in the ancient cosmogony of the Phoenicians by Sanchoniathon. It was' At ys the Lydian, says Lu cian, who, having been mutilated, first es tablished the Mysteries of Rhea, and taught the Phrygians, the Lydians, and t he people of Samothrace to celebrate them. Rhea, like Cybele, was represented drawn by lions, bearing a drum, and crowned with flowers. - According to Varro, Cybele r epresented the earth. She partook of the characteristics of Minerva, Venus, the Moon, Diana, Nemesis, and the Furies ; was clad in precious ston es ; and her High Priest wore a robe of purple and a tiara of gold. `The Grand Feast of the Syri an Goddess, like that of the Mother of the Gods at Rome, was celebrated at the Vernal Equinox. Precis ely at that equinox the Mysteries of Atys were ce lebrated,' in which thi In itiates were taught to expect the rewards of a future life, and the flight of Atys from the jealous fury of Cybele was describ ed, his concealment in the mountains and in a cave, and. His self-mutilation in a fit of delirium ; in which act his priests imitated him. The feast of the passion of Atys conti nued three days; the first of which was passed in m ourning and tears; to which afte rward clamorous rejoicings succeeded ; by which, Macrobi us says, the Sun wa s adored under the name of Atys. The cere monies were all allegorical, some of which, according to the Emperor Julian, could be explained, but more rema ined covered with the veil of mystery. Thus it is that symbols outlast their explanations, as many have done in Masonry, and ig norance and rashness s ubstitute new ones. In another legend, given by Pausanias, Atys dies, wounded like A donis by a wild boar in the `organs of generati on ; a mutilation wi th which all the legends ended. The pine tr ee under which he was said to have died, was sacred to him; and, was fo und upon many monuments, with a bull and a ram near it; one the sign of exaltation of the Sun, and the other of that of the Moon. The worship of the Sun under the name of Mi thras belonged to Persia, whence that name came, as did th e erudite symbols of that worship. The Persians, adorers of Fire, regarded the Sun as; the most br illiant abode of the fecundating energy of that element, which give s life to the earth, and circulates in every part of the Universe, of which it is, as it were, the soul. This worship passed from Persia into Armenia, Cappadocia, and Cilicia, long before it was known at Rome . The Mysteries of Mithra s flurished more than any others in the imperial ci ty. The worship of Mithras commenced to prevail there under Trojan. Hadrian prohibited these Mysteries, on account of the cruel scenes represented in thei r ceremonial : for human victims were immolated therein, and the events of futurity looked for in t heir palpitatirig entrails. They reappeared in gr eater splendor than ever under Commod us, who with his own hand sacrificed a victim to Mithras : and they were still more practiced under Constantine and his succe ssors, when the Priests of Mithras were found everywhere in the Roman Empire, and th e monuments of his worship appeared even in Britain. Caves were consecrated to Mithras, in which were collec ted a multitude of astronomical emblems ; and cruel tests were required of the Initiates. The"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"Persians built no temples ; but wors hipped upon the summits of hills, in enclosures of unhewn stones. They abominated images, and made the S un and Fire emblems of the Deity. The Jews borrowed this from them, a nd represented God as appearing to Abraham in a fl ame of fire, and to Moses as a fire at Horeb and on Sinai. With the Persians, Mi thras, typified in the Sun, was the in visible Deity, the Parent of the Universe, t he Mediator. In Zoroaster's cave of initiation, the' Sun and Planets were repres ented overhead, in gems and gold, as also was the Zodiac. The Sun appear ed emerging from the back of Taurus. Three great pillars, Eternity, Fecundity, and Au thority, supported the roof ; and the w hole was at emblem of the Universe. Zoroaster, like Moses, cl aimed to have conversed fa ce to face, as man with man, with the Deity; and to have received from Him a system of pure worship, to be communicated only to the virtue ous, and those who would devote themselves to the study of Philosophy.- His fame spread over the wo rld, and pupi ls came to hi~n from every country. Even Pythagoras was his scholar. After his novitiate, the candidate ente red the cavern of initiation, and was received on the point of a sword presented to his 425 naked left breast, by which he was slightly wounded. Being crowned with oliv e, anointed with balsam of benzoin, and ot her wise prepared, he was purified with fire and. Water, and went through seven stages of initiation, The symbol of these stages was a high ladder with seven rounds or steps. In them , he went through many fearful trial's in which darkness displayed a pr incipal part. He sa w a representation of the wicked in Hides ; an d finally emerged from dark ness into light. Received it a place represent ing Elysium, in the brilliant assembly of the initiated, where the Arch magus pres ided, robed in blue, he a ssumed the oblig ations of secrecy, and was entru sted with the Sacred Words, of which the I neffable Name of God was the chief. Then all the incidents of his initiation were expl ained to him: he was taught that these ceremonies brou ght him nearer t he Deity; and that he should adore the consecrated Fire, the gi ft of that Deit y and His visible residence. He was taught the sacred characters known only to the initiated; and instructed in regard to the crea tion of . the world, and the true phil osophical meaning of the vulgar mythology ; and especially of the legend of Ormuzd and Ah riman, and the symbolic meaning of the si x Amshaspands created by the former : Bahman, the Lord of Light; Ardibehest, the Genius of Fire ; Shariv er, the Lord of Splendor and Metals; Stapandomad, the Source of Fruitf ulness; Kkordad, the Genius of Water. and Time ; and Amerdad, the prot ector of the Veget able World, and the prime cause of growth. And finally he was taught the tr ue nature of the Supreme Being, Creator of Ormuzd and Ahriman, the' Absolu te First 'Cause, styled Zeruane Akherene. In the Mithriac initiation were severa l Degrees. The firs t, Tertullian says, was that of Soldie r of Mithras. The ceremony oi reception consisted in presenting the candidate a cr own, supported by a swor d. It was placed near his head, and he repelle d it, saying, \"Mithras is my ,crown.\" Then he was declared the soldier of Mithras, and had the right to call th e other Initiates fellow soldiers or companions in arms. Hence the title Companions in the Royal Arch Degree of the American Rite. Then he passed, Porphyry says, th rough. the D egree of the Lion, the"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"constellation Leo, domicile of the Sun and symbol of Mithras,. found on his monuments. These ceremonies were term ed at Rome Leontic and Helium ; and Coracia or Hiero-Coracia, of 426 Heavens below t he Lion, with the Hydra, and also appearing on t he Mithras monuments. Thence he passed to a higher Degree, where the Initia tes were 'called Perses and children of the - Sun. Above them were the Fa thers, whose chief or Patriarch was styled Father of Fathers, or Pater Patratus. The Initiates also bore the title of Eagles and Hawks, birds consecrated to the Sun in Egypt, the former sacred to the God Mendes, and the latter the emblem of the Sun and Royalty. The little island of Samothrace was long the depositary of certain august Mysteries, and many went th ither from all par ts of Greece to be initiated. It was said to have been settled by the anc ient Pelasgi, early Asiatic colonists in Greece. The Gods adored in the Mysteries of this island were termed CABIRI, an oriental word, from Caber, great. Varro calls the G ods of Samothrace, Potent (Gods. In Arabic, Venus is called Caber. Varro sa ys thai the Great Deities whose Mysteries were practiced there, were Heaven and Earth. These were but symbols of the Active and Passive Powers or Princi ples of universal generation. The two Twin, Castor and Poll ux, or the Dioscuri, were also called the Gods of Samothrace; and the Scholiast of Apolloni us, citing Mnaseas, gives the names of Ceres, Proserpine, Pluto, and Mercury, as the fo ur Cabiric Divinities worshipped at Samothrace, as Axieros, Axiocersa, Axiocersus, and Casmillus. Mercury was, there as ever ywhere, the minister and mess enger of the Gods ; and the young servitors of the altars and the children empl oyed in the Temples were called Mercuries or Casmillu s, as they were in Tu scany, by the Etrusci and Pelasgi, who worshipped the Great Gods. Tarquin the Etruscan was an Initiate of the myster ies of Samothrace; and Etruria had its Cabiri as Sa mothrace had. For the worship of the Cabiri spread from that island into Etru ria, Phrygia, and Asia Minor : and it probably came from Phoenicia into Samothra ce : for the Cabiri are m entioned by Sa nchoniathon; and the word Caber belongs to the H ebrew, Phoenician, an d Arabic languages. The Dioscuri, tutelary Deit ies of Navigation, with V enus, were invoked in the Mysteries of Samothrace. Th e constellation Auriga, or Phaeton, was also honored there with imposing cere monies. Upon the Aeronauti c expedition, Orpheus, an Initiate of these 427 Myst eries, a storm arising, counseled his companions to put into Samothrace. They di d so, the storm ceased, and they were initiated into the Mysteries there, and sailed again with the assurance of a fortunat e voyage, under the auspi ces of the Dioscuri, patrons of sailors and navigation. But much more than that was promised the Initiates. The Hierophants of Samo thrace made somethi ng infinitely greater to be the object of their initiations ; to wit, the cons ecration of men to the Deity, by pledging them to virt ue ; and the assurance of those rewards which the justice of the Gods reserves for Initiate s after death. This, above all else, made these ce remonies august, and inspired everywhere so great a respect for them, and so great a desire to be admitted to them. `t hat originally caused the island to be styled Sacred. It was respected by all nations. The Romans, when masters of the world, left it its liberty and laws. It was an"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"asylum for the unfortunates and a sanctuary inviolable. There men were absolved of t he crime of homicide, if not committed in a temple. Ch ildren of tender age were initia ted there, and invested with the sacred robe, the purple tincture, a nd the crown of olive, and seated upon a throne, lik e other Initiates. In the ceremonies was represented the death if the youngest of the Cabiri, slain by his brothers, who fled into Etruria, carrying with them the chest or ark that contained, his genitals: and ther e the Phallus and the sacred ark were ador ed.. Herodotus says t hat the Samothracian Initiates understood the object and origin of this reverence paid the Phallus, and why it was exhibited in t he Mysteries. Clement of Alexandria says that the Cabi ri taught the Tuscany to revere it. It was consecrated at Heliopolis in Syria, where the mysteries of a Divinity having many points of resemb lance with. Atys and Cybele were represented. The Pelasgi connected it with Mercury ;and it appears on the monuments of Mathias ; al ways and every-where a symbol of the life-giving power of the Sun at the Vern al Equinox. In the Indian Mysteries, as the candidate made his three circuits, he paused each time he reached the South, and sa id, \"I copy the example of the Sun, and follow his b eneficent course.\" Blue Masonry has renamed the Circuits, but has utterly lost t he explanation; which is, that in the Mysteries the candidat e invariably repr esented the Sun, descending Southward' toward the reign of. 428 the Evil Principle, Ahriman, Sita, or Typhon (darkness and winter) ; there figurati vely to be slain, and after a few days to rise again from the dead, and commence to ascend to the Northward. Then the death of Sita was bewailed ; or that of Cama, slain by Iswara, aid committed to the waves on a ch est, like Osiris and Bacchus; during which the candidate was terrified by phantom s and horrid noises. Then he was made to personi fy Vishnu, and perform his avatars, or labors. In the first two he was taught in allegories t he legend of the Deluge: in the first he took three step s at right angles, represen ting the three huge steps taken by Vishnu in that avatar; and hence the thr ee steps in the Master's Degree ending at right angles. The nine avatars finished, he was taught the necessity of faith, as superior to sacrifices, acts of char ity, or mortifications of the flesh. Then he was admonished against five crim es, and took a solemn ob ligation never to commit them. He was then introduced into a representation of Paradise; the Company of the Members of the Order, magnificently arrayed, and the Altar with a fire blazing upon it, as an em blem of the Deity. Then a new name was given hi m, and he was invested in a white robe and tiara, and received the signs, tokens, and lectures. A cross was marked on his forehead, and an in verted level, or the Tau Cros s, on his breast. He received the sacred cord, and divers amulets or talism ans; and was then invested with the sacred Word or Sublime Name, known only to the initiated, th e Trilateral A. U. M. Then the multitude of emblem s was explained to the cand idate ; the arcana of science hidden under them, and the di fferent virtue s of which the mythological figures were more personifications. A nd he thus learne4 th e meaning of those symbols, which, to the un initiated, were but a ma ze of unintelligible figures. 429 Godhead , the happiness of the patriarchs, th e destruction by"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"the Deluge, the depravity of the heart, and the necessity of a mediator, the instability of life, t he final destruction of a ll created things, and the restoration of the world in a more perfect form. They inculcated the Eternity of the Soul, explained t he meaning of the doctrine of the Metempsychosis, and held the-doctrine of a state of future rewards and puni shments: and they also earnestly urged that sins c ould only be atoned for by repentance, reformation, and voluntary penance; and not by mere ceremonies and sacrifices. The Mysteries among the Ch inese and Japanes e came frown In dia, and were founded on the same principles and with similar rites. T he word given to the new Initiate was O-Mi-To Fo, in which we recognize the original name A. U. M., coupled at a much late r time with that of Fo, the Indi an Buddha, to show that he was the Great Deity Himself. The equilateral triangle was one of their symbol s; and so was the mystical Y; both alluding to the Triune God, and the latter bei ng the ineffable name of the Deity. A ring supported by two serpents was emblem atical of the world, protected by the power and wi sdom of the Creator; and th at is the origin of the two parallel lines (into wh ich time has changed the two serpents), that support the circle in our Lodges. Among the Japanese, the term of probation for the hi ghest Degree was twenty years. The main features of the Druidical Mysteries resemb led those of the Orient. The ceremonies commenced with a hymn to the sun. The candi dates were arranged in ranks of threes, fives, and sevens, according to their qualifications; and conducted nine time s around the Sanc tuary, from East to West. The candidate underwent many trials, one of which had direct refe rence to the legend of Osiris. He was placed in a boat, and sent out to sea alone, ha ving to rely on his own skill and presence of mind to reach the oppos ite shore in safety. The death of Hu was represented in his hearing, with every ex ternal mark of sorrow, while he was in utter darkne ss. He met with many obs tacles, had to prove his courage, and expose his li fe against armed enemies; represented various animals, and at last, atta ining the permanent light, he was instructed by the Arch-Druid in regard to th e Mysteries, and in the morality of the third Degree was a life of seclusion, after the Initiate's children were capable of providing for themselves ; passed in the forest, in the practi ce of prayers and ablutions, and living only on vegetables. He was th en said to be born again. The fourth was abso lute renuncia tion of the world, se lf-contemplation add self-torture ; by which Perfection was thought to be attained, and the soul merged in the Deity. In the second Degree, th e Initiate was taught th e Unity of the 430 Order, incited to act bravely in war, taught the gr eat truths of t he immortality of the soul and a future stat e, solemnly enjoined not to neglect the worship of the Deity, nor the practice of rigid morality; and to avoid' sloth, contention, and folly. The aspirant attained onl y the exoteric knowledge in the first two Degrees. The third was attained only by a few, and they pe rsons of rank and consequence, and after long purification, and study of all the ar ts and sciences known to the Druids, in solitude, for nine m onths. This was the symbolical death and burial of these` Mysteries. The dangerous voyage upon the actual open sea, in a sm all boat covered with a skin, on the evening of t he 29th of April, was the last trial, and closing"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"scene, of initiation. If he declined this trial, he was dismissed with contempt. If he made it and succeeded, he wa s termed thrice-bor n, was eligible to all the dignities of the State, and received complete instruction in the philosophy= cal and religious doctrines of the Druids. The Greeks also styled t he ,Epopihz T?ig??o?, thri ce-born; and in India perfection was assigned to the Yogi who had acco mplished many births. The general features of th e initiations among the Goths were the same as in all the Mysteries. A long probation, of fast ing and mortification, circular processions, representing th e march of the celestial bo dies, many fearful tests and trials, a descent into th e infernal regions, the ki lling of the God Balder by the Evil Principle, Lok, the placing of his body in a boa t and sending it abroad upon the waters ; and, in short, the Easter n Legend, under different names, and with some variations. The Egyptian Anubis ap peared there, as t he dog guarding the gates of death. The candidate was immured in the representat ion of a tomb; and when released, goes in search of the body of Balder , and finds him, at length, restored to life, and seated upon a throne. He was obligated upon a nak ed sword (as is still the custom in the Rit Moderne), and sealed his obligation by drinking mead out of a human skull. Then all the ancient primitiv e truths were made known to him, so far as they had survived the assaults of time: and he was informed as to the generation of the Gods, the creation of t he world, the delu ge, and the resurr ection, of which that of Balder was a type. He was marked with the sign of the cross and a ring was given 431 to him as a symbol of th e Divine Protection; and also as an emblem of Perfection; from which comes the custom of givi ng a ring to the Aspirant in t he 14th Degree. The point within Circle, and the Cube, emblem of Odin, were explained to him; and lastly, the nature of th e Supreme God, \"the author of everything that existeth, the Eternal, the Ancient, the Living and Awfu l Being, the Searcher into concealed things', th e Being that never changeth ;\" with whom Odin the Conqueror was by the vul gar confounded : and the Triune God of the Indians was reproduced, as Odin, the Almighty FATH ER, FREA, (Rhea or Phre), his wife (emblem of universal matt er), and Thor his son (t he Mediator). Here we recognize Osiris, Isis, and Hor or Horu s. Around the head of Thor, as if to show his eastern origin, twelve stars were arranged in a circle. He was also taught the ulti mate destruction of the wo rld, and the rising of a new one, in which the brav e and virtuous shall enjo y everlasting happiness and delight: as the means of securing which happy fortune, he was taught to practise the strictest morality and vi rtue. The Initiate was prepared to receive the great lessons of all the Mysteries, by long trials, or by abstinence and chastity. For many day s he was required to fast and be continent, and to drink li quids calculated to diminish his pa ssions and keep him chaste. Ablutions were al so required, symbolical of the purity necessary to enable the soul to esc ape from its bondage in ma tter. Sacred butts and preparatory baptisms were used, lustrations, imme rsions, lustral sprinklings, and purifications of every ki nd. At Athens they bath ed in the Ilissus, which thence became a sacred river; and befo re enteringthe Temple of Eleusis, all were required to wash thei r hands in a vase of lust ral water placed near the entrance. Clean hands an d a pure heart were re quired of the candidates.

Clement of Alexandria cites a passage of Meander, who speaks of a purification by sprinkling three times with salt and water Su lphur, resin, and the laurel also served for purificati on as did air, ea rth, water, and fire. The Initiates at Heliopolis, in Syria, says Lucian, sacrificed the sacred lamb, symbol of Aries, then the sign of t he Vernal Equinox ; ate his flesh, as the Israelites. did at the Passover; and then touched his h ead and feet to theirs, and knelt upon the fleece. Then they bathed in warm water, dr ank of the same, and slept upon the ground. There was a distinction between the lesse r and greater Myst eries. One must have been for some ye ars admitted to the former,' before he could receive the latter, which were but a pr eparation for them, the Vestibule of the temple, of which those of Eleusis were the Sanctuary. There, in the lesser Mysteries, they were prepared to receive the holy truths taught in the greater. The Initiates in the lesser were called simply Mystic, or Init iates ; but those in the greater, Epopts) or Seer s. An ancient poet says th at the former were an imperfect shadow of the latter, as sleep is of Death. Afte r admission to the former, the Initiate was taught lessons of morality, and th e rudiments of the sacred science, the most s ublime and secret part of which was reserved for the Epopt, who saw the Tr uth in its nakedness, while the Mystic only viewed it through a veil and under emblems fitter to e xcite than to satisfy his curiosity. Before communicating the first secrets and primary dogmas of initiation, the priests required the candidate to take a fearful oath never to divulge the secrets. Then he made his vows, prayers, and sacrif ices to the Gods. The skins of the victims consecrated to Jupiter were spread on the ground, and he was made to set his feet upon them. He was then taught some enigmatic formulas, as answers to questions, by which to make himself known. He was then enthroned, invested with a purple ti ncture, and crowned with fl owers, or branches of palm or olive. We do not certainly know the time that was required to elapse between the admission to the Lesse r and Greater Mysteries of El eusis. Most writers fix it at five years. It was a singular mark of favor when Demetrius was made Mystic and Epopt in one and the same ceremony. When at lengt h admitted to the Degree of perfection, the Initiate was brought face to face with entire nature, and learned that the soul was the whole of man; that earth wa s but his place of exile; that Heaven was hi s native country; that for the soul to be born is really to die; and that d eath was for it the return to a new life. Then he entered the sanctuary; but he did not receive the whol e instruction at once. It continued through several years. There were, as it were, many apartments, through which be advanced by degrees, and betw een which thick ve ils intervened. There were Statues and Pa intings, says Proclus, in the inmost sanctuary, showing the forms assu med by the Gods. Finally the last veil fell , the sacred covering dropped from the image of the Goddess, and sh e stood revealed in all her splendor, -sur rounded by a divine light, which, filling the whole sanctuary, dazzled the eyes and penetrated th e soul of the In itiate. Thus is symbolized the final revelati on of the true doctrine as to the natur e of Deity and of the soul, and of the relations of each to matt er.

The Temple of the Son of Cecrops resounds with long-c ontinued roars; Eleusis up lifts her sacred torches ; the serpents of Triptole mus are heard to hiss ; an d fearful Hecate appears afar.\" The celebration of the Gr eek Mysteries continued, according to the better opinion, for nine days. On th e first the Initiates met. It was the day of the full moon, of the month B oedromion ; when t he moon was full at the end of the sign Aries, near the Pl eiades and the place of her exaltation in Taurus. The second day there was a procession to the sea, for purification by bathing. The third was occupied wi th offerings, expiator y sacrifices, and other religious rites, such as fasting, m ourning, continence, etc.A mullet was immolated, and of ferings of grai n and living animals made . On the f ourth they carried in procession the mystic wreath of flowers, representing that which Proserpine dropped when se ized by Pluto, and the Cr own of Ariadne in the Heavens. It was borne on a triumphal car drawn by oxen; and women followed bearing mystic chests or bo xes, wrapped with purple clothe, captaining grains of sesame, pyramidal biscuit s, salt, pomegranates and the mysterious serpent, and perhaps the mystic phallus. On the fifth was the superb procession of torches, commemorative of th e search for Proserpine by Ceres ; the Initiates marching by trios, and each bearing a torch; wh ile at the head of the procession marched the Dadoukos. The sixth was consecrated to Iakchos , the young Light-God , son of Ceres, reared in the sanctuaries and bearing the torc h of the Sun-God. The chorus in Aristophanes terms him the luminous star that lights the nocturnal initiation. He was brought from the s anctuary, his head crowned with myrt le, and borne from the gate of the Ceramicus to Eleusis, al ong the sacred way, amid dances, sacred songs, every mark of joy, and mystic cries of Iakchos. On the seventh there were gymnastic exercises and combats, the victors in which were crowned and rewarded. On the eighth was the feast of AEsculapius. On the ninth the famous libation was made for the souls of the departed. The Priests, according to Athena us, filled two vases, pl aced one in the East and one in the West, toward th e gates of day and night, and overturned them, pronouncing a formul a of mysterious prayers. Th us they invoked Light and Darkness, the two great' principles of nature. During all these da ys no one could be ar rested, nor any suit brought, on pain of death, or at least a hea vy fine: and no o ne was allowed, by the display of unusual wealth or magnificence, to endeavor to rival this sacr ed pomp. Everything was for religion. Such were the Mysteries ; and such the Old Thought, as in scatter ed and widel y separated fragments it has co me down to us.

This Degree is both philo sophical and moral.

Maimonides says: \"In the days of Enos, the son of Seth, men fell into grievous errors, and even Enos himsel f partook of thei r infatuation. Their language was, that since God ha s placed on high the heavenly bodies, and used them as Hi s ministers, it was evi dently His wi ll that they should receive from man the same veneration as the servants of a great prince justly claim from the subject multitude. Impre ssed with this notion, they began to build temples to the Stars, to sacrifice to them, and to wors hip them, in the vain expectation t hat they should thus please the Creator of all things. At first, indeed. they di d not suppose the Stars to be the only Deities, but adored in conjunction with them the Lord God Omnipotent. In process of time, however, that gr eat and venerable Na me was totally forgotten, and the whole human race retained no other religion than the idolatrous worship of the Host of Heaven.\" The first learning in the world consisted chiefly in symbols. The wisdom of the Chaldæans, Phœnicians, Eg yptians, Jews; of Zoroaster, Sanchoniathon, Pherecydes, Syrus, Pyt hagoras, Socrates, Plato, of all the ancients, that is come to our hand, is symbolic. It was the mode, says Serranus on Plato's Symposium, of the Ancient Ph ilosophers, to represent truth by certain symbols and hid den images. \"All that can be said c oncerning the Gods,\" says Strabo, \"must be by the exposition of old opini ons and fables; it being the custom of the ancients to wrap up in enigma and allegory their thoughts and discourses concerning Nature; wh ich are therefore not easily explained.\""},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"As you learned in the 24th Degr ee, my Brother, the ancient Philosophers regarded the soul of man as having had its origin in Heaven. That was, Macrob ius says, a settled opini on among them all; and they held it to be the only true wisdom, for the so ul, while united with the body, to look ever toward its source, and stri ve to return to the place whence it came. Am ong the fixed stars it dwel t, until, seduced by the desire of animati ng a body, it descended to be imprisoned in matter. Thenceforward it has no other res ource than recollection, and is ever attracted to toward its bi rth-place and home. The means of return are to be sought fo r in itself. To re-ascend to its source, it must do and suffer in the body. Thus the Mysteries taught the great doctrine of the divine nature and longings after immortality of the soul, of the nobili ty of its origin, the grandeur of its destiny, its superiority over th e animals who have no aspirations heavenward. If they struggled in vain to express its nature, by comparing it to Fire and Light, - if they erred as to its original place of abode, and th e mode of it descent, and the path which, desc ending and ascending, it pursued among the stars and spheres, these were the a ccessories of the Great Truth, and mere allegories designed to make the idea more impressive, and, as it were, tangibl e, to the human mind. Let us, in order to underst and this old Thought, firs t follow the soul in its descent. The sp here or Heaven of the fixe d stars was that Holy Region, and those Elysian Fields, that were the native domicile of souls, and the place to which they re-ascend ed, when they had recovered their primitive purity and simplicity. From that luminous region the soul set fo rth, when it journey ed toward the body; a destination which it di d not reach until it had undergone three degradations, designated by the name of Deaths ; and until it had passed through the seve ral spheres and the elements. All souls remained in possession of Heaven and of happiness, so long as they were wise enough to avoid the c ontagion of the body, and to keep themselves from any contact with matt er. But those who, from that lofty abode, where they were lapped in eternal light, have looked longingly toward the body, and toward that wh ich we here belo w call life, but which is to the soul a real death; and who have conceived for it a secret desire,- those souls, vict ims of their concupiscence, are attracted by degrees toward the inferior region s of the world, by the mere weight of thought an d of that terrestrial desi re. The soul, perfectly incorporeal, does not at once invest itself with the gross envelope of the body, but little by little, by su ccessive and insensib le alterations, and in proportion as it removes further a nd further from t he simple and perfect substance in which it dwelt at first. It first surrounds itself with a body composed of the substance of th e stars; and afterward, as it descends through the seve ral spheres, with ethereal matter more and more gross, thus by degrees desc ending to an earthly body; and its number of degradations or deaths being the same as that of the spheres which it traverses. The Galaxy, Macrobius says, crosse s the Zodiac in two opposite points, Cancer and Capricorn, 'the tropical points in th e sun's course,"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"ordinarily called the Gate s of the Sun. These tw o tropics, before his time, corresponded with those constellations, bu t in his day with Gemini and Sagittarius, in consequen ce of the precession of the equinoxes; but the signs of the Zodi ac remained unch anged; and the Milky Way crossed at t he signs Cancer and Capric orn, though not at those constellations. Through these gates souls were supposed to descend to earth and reascend to Heaven. One, Macrobius says, in his dream of Scipio, was styled the Gate of Men; and the other, the Gate of the Gods. Cancer was the former, because souls descended by it to the earth; and Capricorn the latter, becau se by it they reascen ded to their seats of immortality, and became Gods. From the Milky Way, according to Pythagoras, diverged the route to the dom inions of Pluto. Until they left the Galaxy, they were not deemed to have commence d to descend toward the terrestrial bodies. From that they departed, an d to that they returned. Until they reac hed the sign Cancer , they had not left it, and were still Gods. When they reac hed Leo, they commenced their apprenticeship for their future condit ion; and when t hey were at Aquarius, the sign opposi te Leo, they were fu rthest removed from human life. The soul, descending from the celest ial limits, where the Zodiac and Galaxy unite, loses its sp herical shape, the shape of all Divine Nature, and is lengthened into a cone, as a po int is lengthened in to a line; and then, an indivisible mona d before, it divi des itself and becomes a duad - that is, unity becomes division, disturbance, a nd conflict. Then it begins to experience the di sorder which reigns in matter, to which it unites itself, becoming, as it were, intoxicated by drau ghts of grosser matter: of which inebria tion the cup of Bakchos, between Cancer and Leo, is a symbol. It is fo r them the cup of forgetfu lness. They assemble, says Plato, in the fields of oblivion, to drink ther e the water of the river Ameles, which causes men to forget everything. This fi ction is also found in Virgil. \"If soul s,\" says Macrobius, \"carri ed with them into the bodies they occupy all the knowl edge which they had acquired of divine things, during their sojourn in the Heavens, men would not differ in opinion as to the De ity; but some of them forget more, and some less, of that which they had learned.\" We smile at these notions of the anci ents; but we must learn to look through these material images and all egories, to the id eas, struggling for utterance, the great speechless th oughts which they en velop: and it is well for us to consider whether we ourselves have yet found out any better way of representing to ourselve s the soul's origin and its advent into this body, so entirely foreign to it; if, indeed, we have ever thought about it at all; or have not ceased to think, in despair. The highest and purest portion of matter, wh ich nourishes and constitutes divine existences, is w hat the poets term nectar, the beverage of the Gods. The lower, more disturbed and grosser portion, is what intoxicates souls. The ancients symbolized it as the River Lethe, dark stream of obliv ion. How de we expl ain the soul's for getfulness of its antecedents, or reconcil e that utter absence of remembrance of its former condition, with its essential immo rtality? In truth, we for the most"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"part dread and shrink from any attempt at explanation of it to ourselves. Dragged down by t he heaviness produced by this inebriating draught, the soul falls along the zodiac and the milky way to the lower spheres, and in its descent no t only takes, in ea ch sphere, a new envelope of the material composing the luminous bodies of the planets, but receives there the different faculties which it is to exercise while it inhabits the body. In Saturn, it acquires th e power of reasoning and inte lligence, or what is termed the logical and contem plative faculty. From Ju piter it receives the power of action. Mars gi ves it valor, enterprise, and impetuosity. From the Sun it receives the senses and imagination, which produce sensation, percepti on, and thought. V enus inspires it with desires. Mercury gives it the facu lty of expressing and enunciating w hat it thinks and feels. And, on entering the sphere of the Moon, it acquires the force of generation and growth. This luna ry sphere, lowest and basest to divine bodies, is first a nd highest to terrestrial bodies. And the lunary body there assumed by the soul, while, as it we re, the sediment of celestial matter, is also the firs t substance of animal matter. The celestial bodies, Heav en, the Stars, and the other Divine elements, ever aspire to rise. The soul reaching the region which mo rtality inhabits, tends toward terrestrial bodies, and is deemed to die. Let no one, says Macrobius, be surprised th at we so frequently speak of the death of this soul, which yet we call immortal. It is neither a nnulled nor destroyed by such death: but merely enfeebled for a time; and does not thereby forfeit its prerogative of immortal ity; for afterward, freed from the body, when it has been purified from the vice-stains contracted du ring that connection, it is re-established in all its privileges, and retu rns to the luminous abode of its immortality. On its return, it restores to each sphere through which it ascends, the passions and earthly faculties received from them: to the Moon, the faculty of increase and diminution of the body; to Mercury, fraud, the architect of evil s; to Venus, the se ductive love of pleasure; to the Sun, t he passion for greatness and empire; to Mars, audacity and temerity; to Jupiter, av arice; and to Satu rn, falsehood and deceit: and at last, relieved of all, it enters naked and pure into the eighth sphere or highest Heaven. All this agrees with the doctrine of Plato, that th e soul cannot re-enter into Heaven, until the revolutions of the Universe shall have restored it to its primitive condition, and purified it from the effects of its contact with the four elements. This opinion of the pre-existence of souls, as pure and celestial substances, before their union with our bodies, to put on and animate which they descend from Heaven, is one of great antiquity. A modern Rabbi, Manasseh Ben Is rael, says it was alwa ys the belief of the Hebrews. It was that of most philosophers who ad mitted the immortality of the soul: and t herefore it was taug ht in the Myster ies; for, as Lactantius says, they could not see ho w it was possible that the soul should exist after the body, if it had and not existed before it, and if its nature was not independ ent of that of the body. The same doctrine was adopted by the most learn ed of the Greek Fathers, and by many of the"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"Latins: and it would probably prevail largely at the present day, if men troubled themselves to thin k upon this subject at all, and to inquire whether the soul's im mortality involved its prior existence. Some philosophers held that the soul was incarcer ated in the body, by way of punishment for sins committed by it in a prior state. How they reconciled this with the same soul's unconsciou sness of any such prior state, or of sin commit ted there, does not appear . Others held that God, of his mere will, s ent the soul to inhabit the body. The Kabalists united the two opinions. Th ey held that there are four worlds, Aziluth, Briarth, Jezirath, and Aziath; the worl d of emanation, that of creation, that of forms, and the ma terial world; one above and more perfect than the other, in that order, both as regards their own nature and that of the beings who inhabit them. All souls are originally in the world Aziluth, the Supreme Heaven, abode of God, and of pure an d immortal spirits. Those who descend from it without fault of their own, by God's order, are gifted with a divine fi re, which preserves them from the contagion of matter, and restores them to Heaven so soon as their mission is ended. Those who descend through their own fault, go from wo rld to world, insensibly losing their love of Divine things, and t heir self-contemplation; unti l they reach the world Aziath, falling by t heir own weight. This is a pure Platonism, clothed with the images and words peculiar to the Kabalists. It was the doctrine of the Essenes, who, sa ys Porphyry, \"believe that souls descend from the most subtile ether, at tracted to bodies by the seductions of matter.\" It was in substance the doctrine of Origen; and it came from the Chaldæans, who largely studied t he theory of the Heavens, the spheres, and the influe nces of the signs and constellations. The Gnostics made souls ascend and descend thr ough eight Heavens, in each of which were certain Powe rs that opposed their return, and often drove them back to earth, when not sufficiently purified. The last of these Powers, nearest the lumin ous abode of souls, was a serpent or dragon. In the ancient doctrine, certain Genii were charge d with the duty of conducting souls to the bodies desti ned to receive them, and of withdrawing them from thos e bodies. According to Plutarch, these were the functions of Proserpine and Mercur y. In Plato, a fa miliar Genius accompanies man at his bi rth, follows and watches him all his life, and at death conducts him to the tribunal of the Great judge. T hese Genii are the media of communicati on between man and the Gods ; and the soul is ever in their presence. This doctrine is taught in t he oracles of Zoroaster: and these Genii were the Intelligenc es that resided in the planets. Thus the secret science and mysteri ous emblems of in itiation were connected with the Heaven s, the Spheres, and t he Constellations: and this connection must be studied by whomsoever would understand the ancient mind, and be enabl ed to interpret the allegor ies, and explore the meaning of the symbols, in which th e old sages endeavor ed to delineate the ideas that struggled within them for utter ance, and could be but insufficiently and inadequately expressed by language, whose words are images of those things al one that can be grasped by and are within the empire of the senses."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"It is not possible fo r us thoroughly to appreciate the, feelings with which the ancients regarded t he Heavenly bodies, and the ideas to which their observation of the Heavens gave rise, because we cannot put ourselves in their places, look at the stars with their eyes in the world's youth, and divest ourselves of the knowledge which even the commonest of us have, th at makes us regard the Stars and Planets and all the Univer se of Suns and Worlds, as a me re inanimate machine and aggregate of senseless orbs, no more astonishing, except in degree, than a clock or an orrery.

Babylon was in Latitude 32 º 30' North, and Longitude 44º 23' East: while Saba , the ancient with Sabæan capita l of Ethiopia, was about in Latitude 15º North. Through Egypt ran the grea t River Nile, coming from beyond Ethiopia, its source in regions wholly unknown, in the abodes of heat and fire, and its course from South to North. Its inundati ons had formed the al luvial lands of Upper and Lower Egyp t, which they continued to raise higher and higher, and to fertilize by their depos its. At first, as in all newly-settled countries, those inundations, o ccurring annually and always at the same period of the year, were calamities: until, by means of levees and drains and artificial lakes for irrigation, they be came blessings, and were looked for with joyful anticipation, as they had before been awaited with te rror. Upon the deposit left by the Sacred River, as it wit hdrew into its ban ks, the husbandman sowed his seed; and the rich soil a nd the genial sun insured him an abundant harvest. Babylon lay on the Euphrates, which r an from Southeast to Northwest, blessing, as all rivers in the Orient do, the arid country through which it flowed; but its rapi d and uncertain overfl ows bringing terror and disaster. To the ancients, as yet inventors of no astronom ical instruments, and looking at the Heavens with the eyes of children, this earth was a level plain of unknown ex tent. About its boundar ies there was speculation, but no knowledge. The inequal ities of its surface were the irregularities of a plane. That it was a globe, or that anything lived on its under surface, or on what it rested they had no idea. Every twenty-four hours the sun came up from beyond the Eastern rim of the world, and travelled ac ross the sky, over the earth, always South of, bu t sometimes nearer and so metimes further from the point over-head; and sunk below the world's Western rim. Wi th him went light, a nd after him followed darkness. And every twenty-four hours appeared in the Heavens another body, visible chiefly at night, but someti mes even when the sun shone, which likewise, as if following the sun at a greater or less distance, travelled across the sky; so metimes as a thin crescent, a nd thence increasing to a full orb resplendent with silver ligh t; and sometimes more and sometimes less to the Southwar d of the point over head, within the same limits as the Sun."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Man, enveloped by the thick dark ness of profoundes t night, when everything around him ha s disappeared, and he seems alone with himself and the black s hades that surround him, feels his existence a blank and nothingness, except so far as memory re calls him the glories and splendors of light.

How crushing and overwhelming the thought, the fear, the dread, that perhaps that darkness may be et ernal, and that day may possibly never return; if it ever occurs to his mind, while the solid gloom closes up against him like a wall! Wh at then can restore him to like, to energy, to activity, to fellowship and communion wi th the great worl d which God has spread around him, and wh ich perhaps in the darkness may be passing away? LIGHT restores him to himself and to nature which seemed lost to him. Naturally, therefore, the primitive m en regarded light as the principle of their real existence, without whic h life would be bu t one continued weariness and despair. This necessity for light, and its actual creative energy, were felt by all men: and nothing was more alarming to them than its absence. It became their fi rst Divinity, a single ray of which, flashing into the dark tu multuous bosom of chao s, caused man and all the Universe to emerge from it.

Light was Or muzd, adored by the Pe rsians, and Darkness Ahriman, origin of all evil s. Light was the life of t he Universe, the friend of man, the substance of the Gods and of the Soul. The sky was to them a gr eat, solid, concave ar ch; a hemisphere of unknown material, at an un known distance above the fl at level ea rth; and along it journeyed in th eir courses the Sun, the Moon, the Planets, and the Stars. The Sun was to them a great gl obe of fire, of unknown dimen sions, at an unknown dist ance. The Moon was a mass of softer light; the stars and planets lucent bo dies, armed with unkno wn and supernatural influences. It could not fail to be soon observed, that at regular in tervals the days and nights were equal; and that two of these interval s measured the same space of time as el apsed between the success ive inundations, and between the returns of sp ring-time and harvest. No r could it fail to be perceived that the changes of the moon occurred regularly; the same number of days always el apsing between the first appearance of her silver crescent in the West at evening and that of her full orb rising in the East at the same hour ; and the same again, be tween that and the new appearance of the cre scent in the West. It was also soon observed that the Sun crossed the Heavens in a different line each day, the days being longest and the nights shortest when the line of his passage was fu rthest North, and the days shortest and nights longest when that line wa s furthest South: that his progress North and South was perfectly regular, marking fo ur periods that were always the same, - those when the days and nights were equa l, or the Ve rnal and Autumnal Equinoxes; that when the days were lon gest, or the Summer Solstice; and that when th ey were shortest, or the Winter Solstice. With the Vernal Equi nox, or about the 25 th of March of ou r Calendar, they found that there uner ringly came soft wi nds, the return of warmth, caused"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"by the Sun turning back to the Northw ard from the middl e ground of his course, the vegetation of the new year, and the impul se to amatory action on the part of the animal creation. Then the Bull and the Ram, animals most valuable to the agr iculturist, and sym bols themselves of vigorous generative power, recovere d their vigor, the birds mated and builded their nests, the seeds germinated, the gra ss grew, and the tr ees put forth leaves. With the Summer Solstice, when the Sun reached the extreme northern limit of his course, came great he at, and burning wi nds, and lassitude and exhaustion; then vegetation withered , man longed for the cool breezes of Spring and Autumn, and the cool water of the wintry Nile or Euphrates, and t he Lion sought for that elem ent far from his home in the desert. With the Autumnal Equinox came ripe harves ts, and fruits of the tree and vine, and falling leav es, and cold evenings pres aging wintry frosts; and the Principle and Powe rs of Darkness, pre vailing over those of Ligh t, drove the Sun further to the South, so that the nights grew longer th an the days. And at the Winter Sols tice the earth was wrinkled with frost, the tr ees were leafless, and the Sun, reaching the most Southern point in his career, seem ed to hesitate whether to conti nue descending, to leave t he world to darkness and despair, or to turn upo n his steps and retrace his course to the Northward, bringing back seed-time an d Spring, and gree n leaves and flowers, and all the delights of love. Thus, naturally and necessarily, time was divided, first into days, and then into moons or months, and year s; and with these divisions and the movements of the Heaven ly bodies that marked th em, were associated and connected all men's physical enjoy ments and privat ions. Wholly agricultural, and in their frail habita tions greatly at t he mercy of the elements and the changing seasons, the primitive people of the Orient were most deeply interested in t he recurrence of the periodical phenomena presented by the two great luminarie s of Heaven, on whose regularity all thei r prosperity depended. And the attentive observer soon notic ed that the sma ller lights of Heaven were, apparently, even more regular than the Sun and Moon, and foretold with unerring certainty, by their ri sings and settings, the periods of recurrence of the diff erent phenomena an d seasons on which the physical well-being of all men depended. They soon felt the necessity of distin guishing the individu al stars, or group s of stars, and giving them names, that they might underst and each other, when referring to and designat ing them. Necessity prod uced designations at once natural and arti ficial. Observing that, in t he circle of the year, the renewal and periodical app earance of the producti ons of the earth were constantly associated, not only with the courses of the Sun, but also with the rising and se tting of certain Stars, and with their position relatively to the Sun, the centre to which they referred the whole starry host, the mind naturally co nnected the celestial a nd terrestrial objects that were in fact co nnected: and they commenced by giving to particular Stars or groups of Stars the names of those terrestrial objects which seemed connected with them and for those which still remained unnamed by this nomenclature , they, to complete a system,"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"assumed arbitrary an d fanciful names. Thus the Ethiopian of Thebes or Saba styled those Stars under which the Nile commenced to overflow, Stars of Inundatio n, or that poured out water (AQUARIUS). Those Stars among which the Sun was, when he had reached th e Northern Tropic and began to retreat So uthward, were termed, from his retrogra de motion, the Crab (CANCER). As he approached, in Autumn, the midd le point between the Northern and Southern extremes of his journeyi ng, the days and nights became equal; and the Stars among which he was then found we re called Stars of the Balanc e (LIBRA). Those stars among which the Sun was, when the Lion, dr iven from the Desert by thirst, came to slake it at the Nile, were called St ars of the Lion (LEO). Those among which t he Sun was at harvest, were called those of the Gleaning Virgin, holding a Sheaf of Wheat (VIRGO). Those among which he was fo und in February, wh en the Ewes brought forth their young, were called Stars of the Lamb (ARIES). Those in March, when it was time to plough, were called Stars of the Ox (TAURUS). Those under which hot and bu rning winds came from th e desert, venomous like poisonous reptiles, were called Stars of the Scorpion (SCORPIO). Observing that t he annual return of th e rising of the Nile was always accompanied by the appearance of a beautiful Star, which at that period show ed itself in the direction of the sources of that rive r, and seemed to warn the hu sbandman to be careful not to be surprised by the inun dation, the Ethiopian compared this act of that Star to that of the Animal which by barking gives wa rning of danger, and styled it the Dog (SIRIUS). Thus commencing, and as astronomy came to be more studied, imaginary figures were traced all over the H eavens, to which the differen t Stars were a ssigned. Chief among them were t hose that lay along the path whic h the Sun travelled as he climbed toward the North and descend ed to the South: lying within cert ain limits and extending to an e qual distance on each si de of the line of equal nights and days. This belt, curving like a Serpent, was termed the Zodiac, and di vided into twelve Signs. At the Vernal Equinox, 245 5 years before our Era, the Sun was entering the sign and constellation Taurus, or th e Bull; having passed through, since he commenced, at the Winter Solstice, to ascend Northward. the Signs Aqua rius, Pisces and Aries; on entering the first of which he reached the lowest limit of his journey Southward. From TAURUS, he passed through Gemini and Ca ncer, and reached LEO"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"when he arrived at the terminus of his journey No rthward. Thence, through Leo, Virgo, and Libra, he en tered SCORPIO at the Au tumnal Equinox, and journeyed Southward through Scorpia, Sagittarius, and Capricornus to AQUARIUS, the terminus of his journey South. The path by which he journeyed through these signs became the Ecliptic; and that which passes through the two equinoxes, the Equator. They knew nothing of the immutable laws of nature ; and whenever the Sun commenced to tend S outhward, they feared lest he might continue to do so, and by degrees disappear fore ver, leaving the earth to be ruled forever by darkness, storm, and cold. Hence they rejoiced when he commenced to re-asc end after the Winter Solstice, struggling against the malign influences of Aquarius and Pi sces, and amicably received by the Lamb. And when at the Vernal Equinox he entered Taurus, they still more re joiced at the assurance that the days would again be longer than the nights, that the season of seed -time had come, and the Summer and harves t would follow. And they lamented w hen, after the Autumnal Equino x, the malign in fluence of the venomous Scorpion, and vindictive Archer, and the filthy and ill-omened He-Goat dragged him do wn toward the Wi nter Solstice. Arriving there, t hey said he had been slain, a nd had gone to t he realm of darkness. Remaining there three days, he rose again, and again ascended Northward in the heavens, to redeem the earth from t he gloom and darkness of Winter, which soon became em blematical of sin, and ev il, and suffering; as the Spring, Summer, and Autumn became emblems of happiness and immortality. Soon they personified the Sun, and wo rshipped him under the name of OSIRIS, and transmuted th e legend of his descent am ong the Winter Signs, into a fable of his death, his descent into the infernal regions, and his resurrection. The Moon became Isis, the wife of Osiris; an d Winter, as well as the desert or the ocean into which the Sun descended, became TY PHON, the Spirit or Principle of Evil, warring agai nst and destroying Osiris. From the journey of the S un through the twel ve signs came the legend of the twelve labors of Hercules , and the incarnations of Vishnu and Buddha. Hence came the le gend of the murder of Khürüm, representati ve of the Sun, by the three Fellow-crafts , symbols of the three Wint er signs, Capricornus, Aquarius, and Pisces, who assailed him at the thr ee gates of H eaven and slew him at the Winter Solstice. Hence the search for him by t he nine Fellowcrafts, the other nine signs, his findin g, burial, and resurrection. The celestial Taurus, opening the new year, was the Crea tive of Bull of the Hindus and Japanese, breaki ng with his horn th e egg out of wh ich the world is born. Hence the bull APIS was worshipped by the Egyptians, and reproduced as a golden calf by Aaron in the dese rt. Hence the cow was sacred to the Hindus. Hence, from the sa cred and benefi cent signs of Taurus and Leo, the human-headed wi nged lions and bulls in the palaces at Kouyounjik and Nimroud, like which were the Cherubim set by Solomen in his Temple: and hence the twelve brazen or bronze oxen, on which the layer of brass was supported. The Celestial Vulture or Eagle, rising and setting with the Scorpion, was substituted in its place, in many cases, on account of the mali gn influences of the latter: and thus the four great periods the of the year were mailed by the"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"Bull, the Lion, the Man (Aquarius) and the Eagle; which were upon the respective standards of E phraim, Judah, Reuben, and Dan; and st ill appear on the shield of American Royal Arch Masonry. Afterward the Ram or Lamb be came an object of adorat ion, when, in his turn, he opened the equinox, to deliver the world from the wintry reign of darkness and evil. Around the central and simple idea of t he annual death and re surrection of the Sun a multitude of circ umstantial details soon clustered. Some were derived from other astr onomical phenomena; while many were merely poetical ornaments and inventions. Besides the Sun and Moon, those ancients also saw a beautiful Star, shining with a soft, silvery light, al ways following the Sun at no great distance when he set, or preceding him w hen he rose. Another of a red and angry color, and still another more kingly and br illiant than all, early attracted th eir attention, by their free movements am ong the fixed host s of Heaven: and the latter by his unusual brillian cy, and the regularity with whic h he rose and set, These were Venus, Mars, and Jupi ter. Mercury and Saturn could scarcely have been noticed in the world's infancy, or until astronomy began to a ssume the proportions of a science. In the projection of the ce lestial sphere by the astr onomical priests, the zodiac and constellatio ns, arranged in a circle , presented their halves in diametrical opposition; and the hemisphere of Wint er was said to be adverse, opposed, contrary, to that of slew him Summer. Over the angels of the latter ru led a king (OSIRIS or ORMUZD), en lightened, intelligent, creative, and be neficent. Over the fallen angels or ev il genii of the former, the demons or Devs of the subterranean empire of darkness and sorrow, and it s stars, ruled also a chief. In Egypt the Scorpion first ruled, the sign next the Balance, and long the chief of the Winter signs; and then th e Polar Bear or Ass, ca lled Typhon, that is, deluge, on account of t he rains which inundated the earth while that constellation domineered. In Persia, at a later day, it wa s the serpent, which, personified as Ahri man, was the Evil Princi ple of the religion of Zoroaster. The Sun does not arrive at the sa me moment in each year at the equinoctial point on the equator. The explanation of his anticipating that point belongs to the science of astronomy; and to t hat we refer you for it. The consequence is, what is termed the precession of the equinoxes, by means of whic h the Sun is constantly changing his place in the zodiac, at each ve rnal equinox; so that no w, the signs retaining the names which they ha d 300 years before Ch rist, they and the constellations do not correspond; the Sun being, now in the constellation Pisces, when he is in the sign Aries. The annual amount of precession is 50 seconds and a little over [50\" 1.]. The period of a comp lete Revolution of t he Equinoxes, 25,856 years. The precession am ounts to 30º or a sign, in 2155.6 years. So that, as the sun now enters Pisces at the Vernal Equino x, he entered Aries at that period, 300 years B.C., and Taur us 2455 B.C. And the division of the Ecliptic , now called Taurus, lies in the Cons tellation Aries; while the sign Ge mini is in the Conste llation Taurus.

Eq Winter Sols From confounding signs with causes came the worship of the sun and stars. \"If,\" says job, \"I beheld the sun wh en it shined, or the moon pr ogressive in brightness; and my heart hath been se cretly enticed, or my mout h hath kissed my hand, this were an iniquity to be punis hed by the judge; for I should have denied the God that is above.\" Perhaps we are not, on the whole, much wiser than those simple men of the old time. For what do we know of effect and cause, except t hat one thing regularly or habitually foll ows another? So, because the heliacal risi ng of Sirius preceded the ri sing of the Nile, it was deemed to cause it; and other stars were in like manner held to cause extreme heat, bitter cold, and watery storm. A religious reverence for the zodiacal Bull [TAURUS] app ears, from a very early period, to have been pretty general, - per haps it was universal, throughout Asia; from that chain or region of Caucasus to which it gave name; and which is still known under the appellation of Mount Taurus, to the So uthern extremities of the Indian Peninsula; extending itself also into Europe, and th rough the Eastern parts of Africa. This evidently originated during those re mote ages of the world, when the colure of the ver nal equinox passed across the star s in the head of the sign from Aries."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"from Cancer. from Libra. from Capricornus. from Pisces. from Gemini. from Virgo. from Sagittarius. from Aquarius. from Taurus. from Leo. from Scorpio. Taurus [among which was Aldebarán]; a period when, as t he most ancient monuments of all the oriental nations attest, the light of arts and letters first shone forth. The Arabian word AL-DE-BARÁN , means the foremost, or leading star: and it could only have been so named , when it did precede, or lead, all others. The year then opened with the sun in Taurus; and th e multitude of ancient sculptures, both in Assyria and Egypt, w herein the bull appears with lunette or crescent horns, and the disk of the sun be tween them, are dire ct allusions to the important festival of the first new moon of the year : and there was everywhere an annual celebr ation of the fest ival of the first new moon, when the year opened with Sol and Luna in Taurus. David sings: \"Blow the trum pet in the New Moon; in t he time appoint ed; on our solemn feast-day: for this is a statute unto Israel, and a la w of the God of Jacob. This he orda ined to Joseph, for a testimon y, when he came out of the land of Egypt.\" The reverence paid to Taurus continued long after, by the precession of the Equinoxes, the colure of the vernal equi nox had come to pa ss through Aries. The Chinese still have a temp le, called \"The Palace of the horned Bu ll\" and the same symbol is wors hipped in Japan and all over Hindostan. The Cimbrians carried a brazen bull with them, as the image of their God, w hen they overran Spain and Gaul; and the represent ation of the Creation, by the Deity in the shape of a bull, break ing the shell of an egg with his horn s, meant Taurus, opening the year, and bursti ng the symbolical shell of the annually-recurring orb of the new year. Theophilus says that the Osiris of Egyp t was supposed to be dead or absent fifty days in each year. Land seer thinks that this was because the Sabæan priests were accustomed to see, in the lower latitude s of Egypt and Ethiopia, the first or chief stars of the Husbandman [BOÖTES] si nk achronically beneath the Western horizon; and then to begin th eir lamentations, or hold forth the signal for others to weep: and when his prolific vi rtues were supposed to be transferred to the vernal sun, bacchanalian reve lry became devotion. Before the colure of the Ve rnal Equinox had passed into Aries, and af ter it had left Aldebarán and the Hyades, the Pleiad es were, for seven or eight centuries, the leading stars of the Sabæ an year. And thus we see, on the monuments, the disk and crescent, symbols of the sun and moon in conjunction, appear successively, - first on the head, and then on the ne ck and back of the Zodiacal Bull, and mo re recently on the fo rehead of the Ram. The diagrammatical character or symbol, still in use to denote Taurus, , is"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"this very crescent and disk: a symbol that has come do wn to us from those remote ages when this memorable conj unction in Taurus, by marking the commencement, at once of the Sabæan year and of the cycle of the Chaldean Saros, so pre-em inently distinguis hed that sign as to become its characteristic symbol. On a bronze bull fr om China, the cre scent is attached to the back of the Bu ll, by means of a cl oud, and a curved gr oove is provided for the occasional introduc tion of the disk of the sun, when solar and lunar time were coincident and co njunctive, at the commencem ent of the year, and of the lunar cycle. When t hat was made, the year did not open with the stars in the head of the Bull, but when the colure of the vernal equinox passed across the middle or later degrees of the asterism Ta urus, and the Pleiades were, in China, as in Canaan, the leading stars of the year. The crescent and disk co mbined always represent the conjunctive Sun and Moon; and when plac ed on the head of the Zodiac al Bull, the commencement of the cycle termed SAROS by the Chaldeans, and Me tonic by the Greeks; and supposed to be alluded to in job, by the phrase, \"Mazzaroth in his season\"; that is to say, when the first new Moon and new Sun of the year were coincident, which happened once in eighteen years and a fraction. On the sarcophagus of Al exander, the same symbol appears on the head of a Ram, which, in the time of that monarch, was the l eading sign. So too in the sculptured temples of the Upper Nile, the crescent and disk appear, not on the head of Taurus, but on the forehead of the Ram or the Ram-headed God, whom the Grecian Mythologi sts called Jupiter Ammon, really the Sun in Aries. If we now look for a mome nt at the individual stars which composed and were near to the respective conste llations, we may find some thing that will connect itself with the symbols of the Ancient Myster ies and of Masonry. It is to be noticed that when the Sun is in a pa rticular constellation, no part of that constellation will be seen, except just before sunrise and just after sunset; and then only the edg e of it: but the co nstellations opposite to it will be visible. When the Sun is in Taurus, for example, that is, when Taurus sets with the Sun, Scorpio rises as he sets, and continues visi ble throughout th e night. And if Taurus rises and sets with the Sun to-day, he will, six months hence, rise at sunset and set at sunrise; for the stars th us gain on the Sun two hours a month. Going back to the time when, watched by the Chaldean sh epherds, and the husbandmen of Ethiop ia and Egypt, \"The milk-white Pull with golden horns \"Led on the new- born year,\" we see in the neck of TAURUS, the Pleiades , and in his face t he Hyades, \"which Grecia from their showeri ng names,\" and of whom the brilliant Al debarán is the chief ; while to the southwestward is that most sp lendid of all the constellations, Orion, with Betelgueux in his right should er, Bellatrix in his left shoulder, Rigel on the left foot, and in his belt the three stars known as the Three Kings, and now as the Yard and Ell. Or ion, ran the legend, persecuted the Pleiades; and to save them from his fury, Jupiter placed them in the Heavens, where he still pursues them, but in vain. They, with Arcturus and th e Bands of Orion, are mentioned in the Book of Jo b. They are usually called th e Seven Stars, and it is said there were seven, befor e the fall of Troy; though now only six are visible. The Pleiades were so named from a Greek word signifying to sail. In all ages"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"they have been observed for si gns and seasons. Virgil sa ys that the sailors gave names to \"the Pleiades, Hyades, and t he Northern Car: Pleiadas, Hyadas, Claramque Lycaonis Arcton.\" And Palinurus, he says, Arcturum, pluviasque Hy adas, Geminosque Triones, Armatumque auro circumspicit Oriona - studied Arcturus and the rainy Hyades and the Twin Tri ones, and Orion cinctured with gold. Taurus was the prince an d leader of the celestia l host for more than two thousand years; and when his head set with the Sun about the last of May, the Scorpion was seen to rise in the Southeast. The Pleiades were sometimes called Vergili œ, or the Virgins of Spring; because the Sun entered this cluster of stars in the season of blosso ms. Their Syrian name was Succoth, or Succot hbeneth, derived from a C haldean word signifying to speculate or observe. The Hyades are five st ars in the form of a V, 11º southeast of the Pleiades. The Greeks co unted them as seven. When the Vernal Equinox was in Taurus, Aldeb arán led up the starry host; and as he rose in the East, Aries was about 27º high. When he was close upo n the meridian, the Heaven s presented their most magnificent appearance. Capella was a little further from the meridian , to the north; and Orion still further fr om it to the sout hward. Procyon, Sirius, Castor and Pollux had climb ed about half-way from the ho rizon to the meridian. Regulus had just ri sen upon the ecliptic . The Virgin still lingered bel ow the horizon. Fomalhaut wa s half-way to the me ridian in the Southw est; and to the Northwest were the br illiant constellations, Perseu s, Cepheus, Cassi opeia, and Andromeda; while the Pleiades had just passed the meridian. ORION is visible to all th e habitable world. The equi noctial line passes through the centre of it. When Aldeba rán rose in the East, th e Three Kings in Orion followed him; and as Taurus set, the Sc orpion, by whose st ing it was said Orion died, rose in the East. Orion rises at noon about th e 9th of March. His rising was accompanied with great rains and storms, and it becam e very terrible to mariners. In Boötes, called by the an cient Greeks Lycaon, from lu kos, a wolf, and by the Hebrews, Caleb Anubach, t he Barking Dog, is the Great Star ARCTURUS, which, when Taurus opened the year, corresponded with a season remarkable for its great heat. Next comes GEMINI, the T wins, two human figures, in the heads of which are the bright Stars CASTOR and POLLUX, the Dioscuri, and the Cabiri of Samothrace, patrons of navigat ion; while South of Pollux are the brilliant Stars SIRIUS and PROCYON, the greater and lesser Dog: and still further South, Canopus, in the Ship Argo. Sirius is apparently the la rgest and brightest Star in the Heavens. When the Vernal Equinox was in Taurus, he rose heliacally, that is, just before the Sun, when, at the Summ er Solstice, the Sun entered Leo, about th e 21st of June, fifteen days previous to the sw elling of the Nile. The hel iacal rising of Canopus was also a precursor of the rising of t he Nile. Procyon was t he forerunner of Sirius, and rose before him. There are no important Stars in CANCER. In th e Zodiacs of Esne and Dendera, and in mo st of the astrolog ical remains of Egypt, the sign of this constellat ion was a beetle (Scarabœus), which"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"thence became sacred, as an emblem of the gate thro ugh which souls descended from Heaven. In the crest of Cancer is a cluster of Stars formerly called Prœsepe, the Manger, on each side of which is a small Star, the two of which were ca lled Aselli little asses. In Leo are the splendid St ars, REGULUS, directly on the ecliptic, and DENEBOLA in the Lion's tail. Southeas t of Regulus is t he fine Star COR HYDRÆ. The combat of Hercules with the Nemæan lion was hi s first labor. It was the first sign into which the Sun pass ed, after falling be low the Summer Solstice; from which time he struggled to re-ascend. The Nile overflowed in this sign. It stands first in t he Zodiac of Dendera, and is in all the Indian and Egyp tian Zodiacs. In the left hand of VIRGO (Isis or Ceres) is t he beautiful St ar SPICA Virginis, a little South of the ecliptic. VINDEMIATR IX, of less magnitude, is in the right arm; and Northwest of Spica, in Bo ötes (the husbandman, Osiris), is the splend id star ARCTURUS. The division of the first Decan of the Virgin, Aben Ezra says, represents a beautiful Virgin with flowing ha ir, sitting in a chair, with two ears of corn in her hand, and sucklin g an infant. In an Arabian MS. in the Royal Library at Paris, is a picture of t he Twelve Signs. That of Vi rgo is a young girl with an infant by her side. Virgo was Isis; and her re presentation carrying a child (Horus) in he r arms, exhibited in her te mple, was accompanied by this inscription: \"I AM ALL THAT IS , THAT WAS, AND THAT SHALL BE; and the fruit which I brough t forth is the Sun.\" Nine months after the Su n enters Virgo, he reac hes the Twins. When Scorpio begins to rise, Orion sets: when Scorpio comes to the meridian, Leo begins to set, Typhon reigns, Osiris is slain, and Isis (the Virgin) his sister and wife, follows hi m to the tomb, weeping. The Virgin and Boötes, setting heliacall y at the Autumnal Equinox, delivered the world to the wintry conste llations, and introduc ed into it the genius of Evil, represented by Ophiucus, the Serpent. At the moment of the Wint er Solstice, the Virgin ro se heliacally (with the Sun), having t he Sun (Horus) in her bosom. In LIBRA are four Stars of the second and third m agnitude, which we shall mention hereafter. They are Zuben- es-Chamali, Zuben-e l-Gemabi, Zuben- hak-rabi, and Zuben-el-Gubi. Near the last of these is the brilliant and malign Star, ANTARES in Scorpio. In SCORPIO, ANTARES, of the 1st magnitude, and remark ably red, was one of the four gr eat Stars, FOMALHAUT, in Cetus, ALDEBARAN in Taurus, REGULUS in Leo, and ANTARES, that form erly answered to the Solstitial and Equinoctial points, and were much no ticed by astronomers. This sign was sometimes represented by a Snake, and so metimes by a Crocodile, but generally by a Scorpion, which last is found on the Mithriac Monuments, and on the Zo diac of Dendera. It wa s considered a sign accursed, and the entrance of the Sun into it co mmenced the reign of Typhon. In Sagittarius, Capricornu s, and Aquarius there are no Stars of importance. Near Pisces is the brilli ant Star FOMALHAU T. No sign in the Zodiac is considered of more malig nant influence than this. It was deemed indicative of Violence and Deat h. Both the Syrians and Eg yptians abstained from"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"eating fish, out of dr ead and abhorrence; and wh en the latter would represent anything as od ious, or express hatred by Hieroglyphics, they painted a fish. In Auriga is the bright Star CAPELLA, whic h to the Egyptians never set. And, circling ever round the North Pole are Seven Stars, known as Ursa Major, or the Great Bear, which have been an object of universal observation in all ages of the world. Th ey were venerated alike by the Priests of Bel, t he Magi of Persia, the Shepherds of C haldea, and the Phœnician navigators, as well as by the astronomers of Egypt. Two of them, MERAK and DUBH E, always point to the North Pole. The Phœnician and Egyptian s, says Eusebius, were t he first who ascribed divinity to the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and regarded th em as the sole causes of the production and des truction of all beings. Fr om them went abroad over all the world all kn own opinions as to the gene ration and descent of the Gods. Only the Hebrews looked beyond the visible world to an invisible Creator. All the rest of the world regarded as Gods those luminous bodies that blaze in the firmament, offe red them sacrifices, bowed down before them, and raised nei ther their souls nor t heir worship above the visible heavens. The Chaldeans, Canaanite s, and Syrians, among w hom Abraham lived, did the same. The Canaani tes consecrated horses and chariots to the Sun. The inhabitants of Emesa in Phœnic ian adored him un der the name of Elagabalus; and the S un, as Hercules, was t he great Deity of the Tyrians. The Syrians worshipped, with fear and dread, th e Stars of the Constellation Pisces, and consecrated images of th em in their temples. The Sun as Adonis was wo rshipped in Byblos and about Mount Libanus. There was a magnificent Temple of the Sun at Palmyra, which was pillaged by the soldiers of Aurelian, who r ebuilt it a nd dedicated it anew. The Pleiades, under the name of Succoth -Beneth, were wo rshipped by the Babylonian colonists wh o settled in the country of the Samaritans. Saturn, under the name of Remphan, was worshi pped among the Copts. The planet Jupiter was worshipped as Bel or B aal; Mars as Malec, Melech, or Moloch; Venus as Ashtaroth or Astarte, and Mercury as Nebo, among the Syrians, Assyrians, Ph œnicians, and Canaanites. ' Sanchoniathon says that the earliest Phoenicians ado red the Sun, whom they deemed sole Lord of the Heavens; an d honored him under the name of BEEL-SAMIN, signifyi ng King of Heaven. They raised columns to the elements, fire, and air or wind, and worshipped th em; and Sabæism, or the worship of the Stars, flourished everywhere in Babyl onia. The Arabs, under a sky always cl ear and serene, ador ed the Sun, Moon, and Stars. Abulfaragius so informs us, and that each of the twelve Arab Tribes invoked a particular St ar as its Patron. T he Tribe Hamyar was consecrated to the Sun, the Tribe Cennah to the Moon; the Tribe Misa was under the protection of the beautiful Star in Taurus, Aldebarán; the Tribe Tai under that of Canopus; the Tribe Kais, of Sirius; the Tribes Lachamus and Idamus, of Ju piter; the Tribe Asad, of Mercury; and so on. The Saracens, in the time of Heraclius, worshipp ed Venus, whom they called CABAR, or The Gr eat; and they swore by the S un, Moon, and Stars. Shahristan, an Ar abic author, says that the Arabs and Indians"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"before his time had temple s dedicated to the seven Planets. Abulfaragius says that the seven great primitive nations, from whom all others descended, the Persians, Ch aldæans, Greeks, Egyptian s, Turks, Indians, and Chinese, all original ly were Sabæists, and worshipped the Stars. They all, he says, like the Chaldæans, prayed tu rning toward the North Pole three times a day, at Sunrise, N oon, and Sunset, bow ing themselves three times before the Sun. They invoked the Star s and the Intelligences which inhabited them, offered them sa crifices, and called the fixed stars and planets gods. Philo says that the Ch aldæans regarded the stars as sovereign arbiters of the order of the world, and did not look beyond the visible causes to any in visible and intellectual being. They regarded NATURE as the great divi nity, that exercised it s powers through the action of its parts, t he Sun, Moon, Planets, and Fixed Stars, the successive revolutions of the season s, and the combined action of Heaven and Earth. The great feast of the Sabæans wa s when the Sun reached the Vernal Equinox: and they had five other feasts, at the times when the five minor pla nets entered the signs in which they had their exaltation. Diodorus Siculus in forms us that the Egypti ans recognized two great Divinities, primary and et ernal, the Sun and Moon, which they thought governed the worl d, and from which everything receives its nourishment and growth: that on them depended all and th e great work of generation, and the perfection of all effects produced in natur e. We know that the two great Divinities of Egypt were Os iris and Isis, the greatest agents of nature; according to some , the Sun and M oon, and according to others, Heaven and Earth, or the active and passive principles of generation, And we learn from Porphyry that Chæremon, a l earned priest of Egypt, and many other learned men of that nation, said that the Egyptians recognized as gods the stars composing the zodiac, and all those that by their rising or setting mark ed its divisions; the subd ivisions of the signs into decans, the horosco pe and the stars that presided therein, and which were called Potent Chiefs Heaven: that considering the Sun as the Great God, Architect, and Ruler of the World, they explained not only the fable of Osiris and Isis, but generally all their sa cred legends, by the stars, by their app earance and disappearan ce, by their ascension, by the phases of the moon, and t he increase and diminution of her, light; by the march of the sun, the divi sion of time and the heavens into two parts, one assigned to darkness and the other to li ght; by the Nile and, in fine, by the whole round of physical causes. Lucian tells us that the bull Apis, sacred to the Egyptians, was the image of the celestial Bull, or Taurus; and that Jupiter Ammon, horned like a ram, was an image of the constellation Aries. And Clemens of Alexandria assures us that th e four principal sacred animals, carried in their proc essions, were emblems of the four signs or cardinal points whic h fixed the seasons at the equinoxes and solstices, and di vided into four par ts the yearly march of the sun. They worshipped fire also , and water, and the Ni le, which river they styled Father, Preserver of Egypt, sacred emanation from the Great God Osiris; and in their hymns in which they called it the god crowned with"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"millet (which grain, represented by the pschent, was part of the headdress of their kings), bringi ng with him abunda nce. The other elements were also revered by them: and the Great Gods, wh ose names are found inscribed on an ancient column, are the Ai r, Heaven, the Earth, the Sun, the Moon, Night, and Day. And, in fine, as Eusebius says, they regarded the Universe as a great Deity, composed of a gr eat number of gods, the different par ts of itself. The same worship of the Heavenly Ho st extended into every part of Europe, into Asia Minor, and among the Turks, Scyt hians, and Tartars. The ancient Persians a dored the Sun as Mithras, and also the Moon, Venus, Fire, Earth, Air, and Water; and, having no statues or altars, they sacrificed on high places to the Heavens and to the Sun. On seven ancient pyrea they burned incens e to the Seven Planets, and considered the elements to be divinities. In the Zend-Avesta we find invocations addressed to Mithras, the stars, the elements, trees, mountains, and every part of nature. The Celestial Bull is invoked there, to which the Moon unites herself; and the four gr eat stars, Taschter, Satevis, Haftorang, and Ve nant, the great Star Ra pitan, and the other constellations which watch over the different portions of the earth. The Magi, like a multitude of ancient nations, worshipped fire, above all the other elements and po wers of nature. In Indi a, the Ganges and the Indus were worshipped, and the Sun was the Gr eat Divinity. They worshipped the Moon also, and kept up the sacred fire. In Ceylon, the Sun, Moon, and othe r planets were wo rshipped: in Suma tra, the Sun, called Iri, and the Moon, called Handa. A nd the Chinese built Temples to Heaven, the Earth, and gen ii of the air, of the wa ter, of the mountains, and of the stars, to the sea-dragon, and to the planet Mars. The celebrated Labyrinth was built in honor of the Sun; and its twelve palaces, like the twelve superb columns of the Temple is, at Hieropolis, covered with symbols rela ting to the twelve signs and the occult qualities of the elements, were consecrated to the twelve gods or tutelary genii of the si gns of the Zodiac. The figure of the pyramid and t hat of the obelisk, rese mbling the shape of a flame, caused these monuments to be consecrated to the Sun and to Fire. And Timæus of Locri a says: \"The equilateral triangle enters into the composition of the pyramid, which has four equal faces and equal angles, and which in this is like fire, the most subt le and mobile of the elements.\" They and the obelisks were erected in honor of the Sun, termed in an inscription upon one of the latter, translated by the Egyptian Hermapion, and to be found in Ammianus Marcellinus, \"Apollo the strong, Son of God, he who made t he world, true Lord of the diadems, who possesses Egypt and fills it with His glory.\" The two most famous divisi ons of the Heavens, by seven, which is that of the planets, and by tw elve, which is that of the signs, are found on the religious monuments of all the people of the ancient world. The twelve Great Gods of Egypt are me t with everywhere. They were adopted by the Greeks an d Romans; and the latter assigned one of them to each sign of the Zodiac. Th eir images were s een at Athens, where an altar was erect ed to each; and they were painted on the porticos. The People of the North had their twelve Azes , or Senate of"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"twelve great gods, of w hom Odin was chief. The Japanese had the same number, and like the Egyptians divided them in to classes, seven, who were the most anci ent, and five, afterward added: both of which numbers are well kn own and consecrat ed in Masonry. There is no more striking proof of the universal adoration paid the stars and constellations, than the arrangement of the He brew camp in the Desert, and the allegory in regard to the twelve Tribes of Israel, ascribed in the Hebrew legends to Jacob. Th e Hebrew camp was a quadrilateral, in sixteen divisions, of which t he central four were occupied by images of the four elements. The four divisions at the four angles of the quadrilateral exhibited the four sign s that the astrologers called fixed, and which they regard as subject to the influence of the four great Royal Stars, Regulus in Leo, Aldebaran in Ta urus, Antares in Scorpio, and Fomalhaut in the mouth of Pisce s, on which falls the water poured out by Aquariu s; of which constellatio ns the Scorpion was represented in the Hebrew blazonry by the Celestial Vult ure or Eagle, that rises at the same ti me with it and is its paranatellon. The other signs were arranged on th e four faces of the quad ilateral, and in the parallel and interior divisions. There is an astonishing co incidence between the char acteristics assigned by Jacob to his sons, and those of the signs of t he Zodiac, or the planets that have their domicile in those signs. Reuben is compared to runnin g water, unstable, and that cannot excel; and he answers to Aquarius, his ensign being a man. The wate r poured out by Aquarius flows toward the South Pole, and it is the first of the four Ro yal Signs, ascending from the Winter Solstice. The Lion (Leo) is the devic e of Judah; and Jaco b compares him to that animal, whose constellation in the Heavens is the domicile of the Sun; the Lion of the Tribe of Judah; by whose grip , when that of appr entice and that of fellow-craft, - of Aquarius at the Winter So lstice and of Cancer at th e Vernal Equinox, - had not succeeded in raising him, Khürüm was lifted out of the grave. Ephraim, on whose ensign appear s the Celestial Bull, Jaco b compares to the ox. Dan, bearing as his device a Scorpion, he compares to the Cerastes or horned Serpent, synonymous in as trological language with th e vulture or pouncing eagle; and which bird was of ten substituted on the flag of Dan, in place of the venomous scorpion, on account of the terror which that reptile inspired, as the symbol of Typhon and his malign influences; wheref ore the Eagle, as its paranatellon, that is, rising and setting at the same time with it, was naturally used in its stead. Henc e the four famous fi gures in the sacred pictures of the Jews and Christians, and in Royal Arch Masonry, of t he Lion, the Ox, the Man, and the Eagle, the four creatures of the Ap ocalypse, copied ther e from Ezekiel, in whose reveries and rhapsodies they are seen revolving around blazing circles. The Ram, domicile of Mars, chief of the Celestial Soldiery and of the twelve Signs, is the device of Gad, whom Jacob charac terizes as a warrior, chief of his army. Cancer, in which are the stars termed Aselli, or little asse s, is the device of the flag of Issachar, whom Jac ob compares to an ass. Capricorn, of old represented with the tail of a fish, and called by astronomers the Son of Neptune, is the device of Zebulon, of whom Jacob says that he dwells"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"on the shore of the sea. Sagittarius, chasing the Cele stial Wolf, is the emblem of Benjamin, whom Jacob compares to a hunter: and in that constellation th e Romans placed the domicile of Diana the huntr ess. Virgo, the domicile of Mercury, is borne on t he flag of Napht ali, whose eloquence and agility Jacob magnifies, both of which are attrib utes of the Courier of the Gods. And of Simeon and Levi he speaks as united, as are the two fishes that make the Cons tellation Pisces, which is their armorial emblem. Plato, in his Republic, followed the divisions of the Zodiac and the planets. So also did L ycurgus at Sparta, and Ce crops in the Athenian Commonwealth. Chun, the Ch inese legislator, divide d China into twelve Tcheou, and spec ially designated tw elve mountains. The Etruscans divided themselves into twelve C antons. Romulus appointed twelve Lictors. There were twelve tribes of Ishmael and tw elve disciples of the Hebrew Reformer. The New Jerusalem of the Apocalypse has twelve gates. The Souciet, a Chinese book, speaks of a palace composed of four buildings, whose gates looked toward the four corner s of the worl d. That on the East was dedicated to the new moons of the mo nths of Spring; that on the West to those of Autumn; that on the South to t hose of Summer; and that on the North to those of Winter: and in this, palace the Emperor and his grandees sacrificed a lamb, t he animal that repr esented the Sun at the Vernal Equinox. Among the Greeks, the march of the Choruses in their theatres represented the moveme nts of the Heavens an d the planets, and the Strophe and Anti-Strophe im itated, Aristoxenes says, the movements of the Stars. The number five was sacred among the Chines e, as that of the planets other than the Sun and M oon. Astrology consec rated the numbers twelve, seven, thirty, a nd three hundred and sixty; and ev erywhere seven, the number of the planets, was as sacred as twelve, that of the signs, the months, the oriental cycles, and the sections of the horizon. We shall speak more at large hereaf ter, in another Degree, as to th ese and other numbers, to which the ancients ascribed mysterious powers. The Signs of the Zodiac and the Stars appeared on many of the ancient coins and medals. On the public seal of the Locrians, Ozoles was Hesperus, or the planet Venus. On the medals of Antioch on the Orontes was the ram and crescent; and the Ram was the special De ity of Syria, assigned to it in the divi sion of the earth among the twelve signs. On the Cretan coins was the Equinoctial Bull; and he also appeared on those of the Mamertins and of Athens. Sagi ttarius appeared on those of the Persians. In India the twelve signs appeared upon the an cient coins. The Scorpion was engraved on the medals of the Kings of Co magena, and Capricorn on those of Zeugnia, A nazorba, and other cities . On the medals of Antoninus are found nearly all the signs of the Zodiac. Astrology was practised among all the ancient nati ons. In Egypt, the book of Astrology wa s borne reverentially in th e religious processions; in which the few sacred animals were also carried, as emblems of the equinoxes and solstices. The sa me science flourished among the Chaldeans, and over the whole of Asia and Af rica. When Alexander"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"invaded India, the astrol ogers of the Oxydrace s came to him to disclose the secrets of their scienc e of Heaven and the Stars. The Brahimins whom Apollonius consul ted, taught him th e secrets of Astronomy, with the ce remonies and prayers w hereby to appease the gods and learn the future from the stars. In Chin a, astrology taught the mode of governing the State and families. In Ar abia it was deemed the mother of the sciences; a nd old libraries ar e full of Arabic books on this pretended science. It flourished at Rome. Constantine had his horoscope drawn by the astrologer Valens. It was a science in the middle ages, and even to this day is neither forg otten nor unpractised. Catherine de Medici was fond of it. Louis XIV. consulted his horoscope, and the learned Casini commenced his career as an astrologer. The ancient Sabæans establ ished feasts in honor of each planet, on the day, for each, when it entered its place of exal tation, or reached the particular degree in the part icular sign of the zodi ac in which astrology had fixed the place of its exaltation; that is, the place in the Heavens where its influence was su pposed to be greatest, an d where it acted on Nature with the greatest energy. The place of exal tation of the Sun was in Aries, because, reaching that point, he awakens all Nature, and warms into life all the germs of vegetation; an d therefore his most solemn feast among all nations, for many years before our Era, was fixed at the time of his entrance into that sign. In Egypt, it was called the Feast of Fire and Light. It wa s the Passover, when the Paschal Lamb was slain and eate n, among the Jews, and Neurouz among the Persians. The Romans preferred the place of domicile to that of exaltation; and celebrated the feasts of the planets under the signs that were their houses. The Chaldeans, whom and not the Egyptians, the Sabæans followed in this, prefer red the places of exaltation. Saturn, from the length of time required for his apparent revolution, was considered the most re mote, and the Moon t he nearest planet. After the Moon came Mercury and Venus , then the Sun, and then Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. So the risings and settings of the Fixed Star s, and their conjunctions with the Sun, and thei r first appearance as they emerged from his rays, fixed the epochs for the feasts instituted in th eir honor; and the Sacred Calendars of the an cients were regulated accordingly. In the Roman games of the circus, ce lebrated in honor of the Sun and of entire Nature, the S un, Moon, Planets, Zodiac , Elements, and the most apparent parts and potent agents of Nature were pe rsonified and represented, and the cour ses of the Sun in the He avens were imitated in the Hippodrome; his c hariot being drawn by four horses of different colors, representing the four elements and season s. The courses were from East to West, like the circuits round t he Lodge, and seven in number, to correspo nd with the number of planet s. The move ments of the Seven Stars that revolve around th e pole were also represented, as were those of Capella, which by its heliacal rising at the moment when the Sun reached t he Pleiades, in Taur us, announced the commencement of the annual revolution of the Sun. The intersection of the Zodiac by the colures at the Equinoctial and Solstitial points, fixed four periods, each of whic h has, by one or more"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"nations, and in some ca ses by the same nation at different periods, been taken for the commencement of the year. Some adopted the Vernal Equinox, because then day bega n to prevail over night, and light gained a victory ov er darkness. Sometimes the Summer Solstice was preferred; because then day atta ined its maximum of duration, and the acme of its glory a nd perfection. In Egypt, another reason was, that then the Nile began to ov erflow, at the hel iacal rising of Sirius. Some preferred the Autumnal Equinox, be cause then the harvests were gathered, and the h opes of a new crop were depos ited in the bosom of the earth. And some pref erred the Winter Solsti ce, because then, the shortest day having arrived, their l ength commenced to increase, and Light began the ca reer destined to end in victory at the Vernal Equinox. The Sun was figuratively sa id to die and be born again at the Winter Solstice; the games of the Circus, in honor of the invinc ible God-Sun, were then celebrated, and the Roman ye ar estab lished or reformed by Numa, commenced. Many peoples of Italy commenced their ye ar, Macrobius says, at that time; and represented by the four ages of man the gradual succession of pe riodical increase and diminution of day, and the light of the Sun; likening him to an infant born at the Winter Solstice, a young man at the Vernal Equinox, a robust man at the Summer Solstice, and an old man at t he Autumnal Equinox. This idea was borr owed from the Egyp tians, who adored the Sun at the Winter Solstice, under t he figure of an infant. The image of the Sign in which each of the f our seasons commenced, became the form under which was figur ed the Sun of that particular season. The Lion's skin was worn by Hercules; the horn s of the Bull adorned the fore head of Bacchus; an d the autumnal se rpent wound its long folds round the Statue of Serapis, 2500 years before our era; when those Signs corresponded with the commencement of the Seasons. When other conste llations replaced t hem at those points, by means of the precession of the Equinoxes, those attribut es were changed. Then the Ram furnished the horns for the he ad of the Sun, under the name of Jupiter Ammon. He was no longer born exposed to the waters of Aquarius, like Bacchus, nor enclosed in an urn like the God Canopus; but in the Stables of A ugeas or the Celestial Go at. He then completed his triumph, mounted on an ass, in the constellation Cancer, which then occupied the Solstitial point of Summer. Other attributes the images of the Sun borrowed from the constellations which, by their rising a nd setting, fixed the points of departure of the year, and the commencements of it s four principa l divisions. First the Bull and afterward the Ram (c alled by the Persians the Lamb), was regarded as t he regenerator of Nature, thr ough his union with the Sun. Each, in his turn, was an emblem of the Sun overcoming the winter darkness, and repai ring the disorders of Nature , which every year was regenerated under these Signs, after the Scorpion and Serpent of Autumn had brought upon it barrenness, disast er, and darkness. Mithras was represen ted sitting on a Bull ; and that animal was an image of Osiris: while the Greek Bacchus ar med his front with its horns, and was pictured with it s tail and feet. The Constellations also became notew orthy to the husbandman, which"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"by their rising or se tting, at morning or evening, indicated the coming of this period of renewed fruitful ness and new life. Capella, or the kid Amalthea, whos e horn is called that of abundance, awl whose place is over the equinocti al point, or Taurus; and the Pleiades, that long indicated the Seasons, and gave rise to a multitude of poet ic fables, were the most observed and most celebrated in antiquity. The original Roman year commenced at the Vernal Equinox. July was formerly called Quintilis, th e 5th month, and August Sextilis, the 6th, as September is still the 7th month, October the 8th, and so on. The Persians commenced their year at the same time, and celebrated their great feast of Neurouz w hen the Sun entere d Aries and the Constellation Perseus rose, - Perseus, who first bro ught down to earth t he heavenly fire consecrated in their te mples: and all th e ceremonies then practised reminded men of the renovat ion of Nature and the tr iumph of Ormuzd, the Light-God, over the powers of Darkness and Ahrima n their Chief. The Legislator of t he Jews fixed the commencemen t of their year in the month Nisan, at the Vern al Equinox, at which season the Israelites marched out of Egypt and were relieved of their long bondage; in commemoration of which Exodus, they ate the Paschal Lamb at that Equinox. And when Bacchus and his ar my had long march ed in burning deserts, they were led by a Lamb or Ram into beaut iful meadows, and to the Springs that watered th e Temple of Jupiter Ammo n. For, to the Arabs and Ethiopians, whose great Divinity Bacchus wa s, nothing was so perfect a type of Elysium as a Country abounding in springs and rivulets. Orion, on the same meridian with the Stars of Taurus , died of the sting of the celestial Scorpion, that rises when he sets; as dies the Bull of Mithras in Autumn: and in the St ars that corresp ond with the Autu mnal Equinox we find those malevolent gen ii that ever war against the Principle of good, and that take from the Sun and the Heavens the fruit-producing power that they communic ate to the earth. With the Vernal Eq uinox, dear to the sailor as to the husbandman, came the Stars that, with the Su n, open navigation, and ru le the stormy Seas. Then the Twins plunge into the solar fires, or disa ppear at setting, going down with the Sun into the bosom of the waters. And these tutelary Divinities of mariners, the Dioscuri or Chief Cahiri of Samothrace, sailed with Jason to possess themselves of t he golden-fleeced ra m, or Aries, whose rising in the morning announced the Sun's entry into Taurus, when the Serpentbearer Jason rose in the evening, and, in aspect with the Dioscuri, was deemed their brother. An d Orion, son of Nept une, and most potent controller of the tempest-tortured ocean, announcing sometimes calm and sometimes tempest, rose after Taur us, rejoicing in the forehead of the new year. The Summer Solstice was not less an important point in the Sun's march than the Vernal Equinox, especially to the Egyptians, to whom it not only marked the end and term of th e increasing length of the days and of the domination of light, and the maximum of the Sun's elevation; but also the annual recurrence of that pheno menon peculiar to Egypt, the rising of the Ni le, which, ever accompanyi ng the Sun in his course, seemed to rise and fall as the days grew longer and shorte r, being"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"lowest at the Winter So lstice, and highest at that of Summer. Thus the Sun seemed to regulate it s swelling; and t he time of his a rrival at the solstitial point being that of the first rising of the Nile, was selected by the Egyptians as the beginning of a y ear which they call ed the Year of God, and of the Sothiac Period, or the period of Sothis, the Dog-Star, who, rising in the mornin g, fixed that epoch, so important to the people of Egypt. This year was also called the Heliac, t hat is the Solar year, and the Canicular year; and it consisted of three hu ndred and sixty-five days, without intercalation; so that at the end of fo ur years, or of four times three hundred and sixty-five days, maki ng 1460 days, it needed to add a day, to make f our complete revo lutions of the Su n. To correct this, some Nations made every fourth year consist, as we do now, of 366 days: but the Egyptians preferred to add nothing to the year of 365 days, which, at the end of 120 years, or of 30 ti mes 4 years, was short 30 days or a month; t hat is to say, it required a month more to complete the 120 revolutions of t he Sun, though so many were count ed, that is, so many years. Of cour se the commencem ent of the 121st year would not correspond with the Su mmer Solstice, but woul d precede it by a month: so that, when the Sun arrived at the Solsti tial point whence he at first set out, and wher eto he must needs return , to make in reality 120 years, or 120 complete revolution s, the first month of the 121st year would have ended. Thus, if the commencement of th e year went back 30 days every 120 years, this commencement of the year, continuing to recede, would, at the end of 12 times 120 year s, or of 1460 years, get back to the Solstitial poin t, or primitive point of departure of the period. The Sun would then have made but 1459 revolutions, though 1460 were counted; to make up which, a year more w ould need to be added. So that the Sun would not have made his 1460 revo lutions until the end of 1461 years of 365 da ys each, - each revolution being in reality not 365 days exactly, but 365 ¼. This period of 1461 year s, each of 365 days, bringing back the commencement of the Solar year to the Solstitial point, at the rising of Sirius, after 1460 co mplete Solar revolutions, was called in Egypt the Sothiac period, the po int of depar ture whereof was the Summer Solstice, first occupied by the Li on and afterward by Cancer, under which sign is Sirius, which opened the period. It was, says Porphyry, at this Solstitial Ne w Moon, accompanied by the rising of Se th or the Dog- Star, that the beginning of the year was fixed, and that of the generation of all things, or, as it were, the natal hour of the world. Not Sirius alone determined the pe riod of the rising of the Nile, Aquarius, his urn, and t he stream flowing from it , in opposition to the sign of the Summer Sols tice then occupied by t he Sun, opened in the evening the march of Nigh t, and received the full Moon in his cup. Above him and with him ro se the feet of Pegasus , struck wherewith the waters flow forth that the Muses drink. The Lion and, the Dog, indicating, were supposed to c ause the inundation, and so were worshipped. While the S un passed through Leo, th e waters doubled their depth; and the sacr ed fountains pour ed their stream s through the heads of lions. Hydra, ri sing between Sirius and Leo, extended under"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"three signs. Its 'head rose with Cancer, and it s tail with the feet of the Virgin and the beginning of Libra; and the inundat ion continued while the Sun passed along its whole extent. The successive contest of light and dar kness for the possession of the lunar disk, each being by turns vi ctor and vanquis hed, exactly resembled what pa ssed upon the earth by he acti on of the S un and his journeys from one Solstice to th e other. The lunary revolution presented the same periods of light and darkness as the year, and was the object of the same religious fictions. Above the Moon, Pliny said, everything is pure, and fill ed with eternal light. Th ere ends the cone of shadow which the earth projects, and which produces nigh t; there ends the sojourn of night and darkness; to it the air extends; but there we en ter the pure substance. The Egyptians assigned to the Moon th e demiurgic or crea tive force of Osiris, who united himself to her in the spring, when the Sun communicated to her the principles of generati on which she afterward disseminated in the air and all the elements. T he Persians considered the Moon to have been im pregnated by the Celestia l Bull, first of the signs of spring. In all ages, the Moon has been supposed to have great influence upon vegetation, and the birth and growth of anim als; and the belief is as widely entertained now as ever, and that in fluence regarded as a mysterious and inexplicable o ne. Not the astrologers alone, but Naturalists like Pliny, Philosophe rs like Plutarch and Cicero, Theologians like the Egypti an Priests, and Metaphysi cians like Proclus, believed firmly in thes e lunar influences. \"The Egyptians,\" says Diodorus Si culus, \"acknowl edged two great gods, the Sun and Moon, or Osiris and Isis, who govern the world and regulate its administrati on by the dispensation of the seasons . . . . Such is the nature of t hese two great Divinities, that they impress an active and fecundating force, by wh ich the generation of beings in effected; the Sun, by h eat and that spiritual pr inciple that forms the breath of the winds; the Moon by humidity and dryness; and both by the forces of the air which they sh are in common. By this beneficial influence everything is born, grow s, and vegetates. Wherefore this whole huge body, in wh ich nature resides, is maintained by the combined action of the Sun and Moon, and their fi ve qualities, - the principles spiritual, fiery, dry, humid, and airy.\" So five primitive powers , elements, or elementary qualities, are united with the Sun and Moon in the Indian theology, - air, spirit, fire, water, and earth: and the same five elements are recognized by the Chinese. The Phœnicians, like the Egyptians, regarded the Sun and Moon and Stars as sole causes of generat ion and destruction here below. The Moon, like t he Sun, changed co ntinually the tra ck in which she crossed the Heavens, moving ever to and fro between the upper and lower limits of the Zodiac; and he r different places , phases, and aspects there, and her relations with the Sun and the constellations, have been a fruitful source of mythological fables. All the planets had what astrol ogy termed their houses, in the Zodiac. The House of th e Sun was in Leo, and that of the Moon in Cancer. Each other pla net had two, signs; Me rcury had Gemini and"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"Virgo; Venus, Taurus and Libra; Mars, Aries and Scorpio; Jupiter, Pisces and Sagittarius; and Saturn , Aquarius and Capr icornus. From this distribution of t he signs also came many mythological emblems and fables; as also many came from the places of exaltation of the planets. Diana of Ephesus, the Moon, wore the image of a crab on her bosom, because in that sign was the Moon's do micile; and lions bore up the throne of Horus, t he Egyptian Apollo, the Sun personified, for a like reason: while the Egyptians cons ecrated the tauriforn scarabæs to the Moon, because she had her place of exaltation in Taurus; and for the same reason Mercury is said to have presented Isis with a helmet like a bull's head. A further division of the Zodiac was of each sign in to three parts of 10º each, called Decans, or, in the whol e Zodiac, 36 part s, among which the seven planets were apportioned anew, each planet having an equal number of Decans, e xcept the first, which, opening and closing the series of planets five times r epeated, necessarily had one Decan more than the others. This subdivis ion was not invented until after Aries opened the Vernal Equinox; and accordingly Mars, having his house in Aries, opens the series of decans and closes it; the planets following each other, five times in succession, in the following order, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Merc ury, the Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, etc.; so that to each sign are assigned three planets, ea ch occupying 10 degrees. To each Decan a God or Genius was assigned, making thirtysix in all, one of whom, the Chaldeans said, came down upon earth every ten days, remained so many days, and re -ascended to Heaven. This division is found on the Indian sphere, the Persian, and that Barbaric one which Aben Ezra describes. Each ge nius of the Decans had a name and special charac teristics. They conc ur and aid in the effects produced by t he Sun, Moon, and other pl anets charged with the administration of the worl d: and the doctrine in rega rd to them, secret and august as it was held, was consi dered of the graves t importance; and its principles, Firmicus says, were not entrusted by the ancients, inspired as they were by the Deity, to any but the Initiates, and to them only with great reserve, and a kind of fear, and when cautiously enveloped with an obscure ve il, that they might not come to be known by the profane. With these Decans were connected the paranatellons or those stars outside of the Zodiac, t hat rise and set at the same moment with the several divisions of 10º of each sign. As there were an ciently only fortyeight celestial figures or constellations , of which twelve were in the Zodiac, it follows that t here were, outside of the Zo diac, thirty-six other asterisms, paranatellons of the several thirty-six Decans. For example, as when Capricorn set, Sirius and Procyon, or Canis Major and Canis Minor, rose, they were the Paranatellons of C apricorn, though at a great distance from it in the heavens. The rising of Cancer was known from the setting of Co rona Borealis and the ri sing of the Great and Little Dog, its three paranatellons. The risings and setti ngs of the Stars are always spoken of as connected with the Sun. In that connection ther e are three kinds of them, cosmical, achronical, and heliacal, important to be distinguished"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"by all who would understand this ancient learning. When any Star rises or sets with the same degree of the same sign of the Zodiac that the Sun occupies at the time, it rises and sets simultaneously with the Sun, and this is term ed rising or setting cosmically; but a star t hat so rises and sets ca n never be seen, on account of the light that precedes, and is left behin d by the Sun. It is therefore necessary, in order to k now his place in the Zodiac, to observe stars that rise just be fore or set just after him. A Star that is in the Fast when night commences, and in the West when it ends, is said to rise and set achronically. A St ar so rising or setting was in opposition to the Sun, rising at the end of eveni ng twilight, and setting at the beginning of morning twilight, and this happened to each Star but once a year, bec ause the Sun moves from West to Fast, with reference to the Stars, one degree a day. When a Star rises as night ends in the morning, or sets as night commences in the evening, it is said to rise or set heliacally, because the Sun (Helios) seems to touch it with his luminous atmo sphere. A Star thus re-appears afte r a disappearance, often, of several months, and thenceforward it rises an hour earlier each day, gradually emerging from the Sun's rays, until at the end of thre e months it precedes the Sun six h ours, and rises at mi dnight. A Star sets heliacally, when no longer remainin g visible above the western horizon after sunset, the day arrive s when they cease to be seen setting in the West . They so remain invi sible, until the Sun passes so far to the East ward as not to eclipse them with his light; and then they re-appear, but in the East, about an hour and a half before sunrise: and this is their heliacal rising. In this interval, the cosmical rising and settin g take place. Besides the relations of the constellations and their paranatelIons with the houses and places of exaltation of the Planets, and with their places in the respective Signs and Decans , the Stars were supposed to produce different effects according as they rose or set, and according as they did so either cosmically, achronicany, or heliacally; and also according to the different seasons of the year in which these phenomena occurred; and these differences were carefully marked on the old Calendars; and many things in the ancient allegories are referable to them. Another and most important division of the Stars wa s into good and bad, beneficent and malevolent. With the Persia ns, the former, of the Zodiacal Constellations, were from Aries to Virg o, inclusive; and the latter from Libra to Pi sces, inclusive. Hence t he good Angels and Genii, and the bad Angels, Devs, Evil Genii, De vils, Fallen Angel s, Titans, and Giants of the Mythology. T he other thirty-six Conste llations were equally divided, eighteen on each si de, or, with those of t he Zodiac, twenty-four. Thus the symbolic Egg, that issued from the m outh of the invisible Egyptian God KNEPH; known in the Gr ecian Mysteries as the Orphic Egg; from which issued the God CHUMONG of the Coresians, and the Egyptian OSIRISS, and PHANES, God and Principle of Light; from which, broken by the Sacred Bull of the Japanese, the world emerged; and which the Greeks plac ed at the feet of BA CCHUS TAURI-CORNUS;"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"the Magian Egg of ORMU ZD, from whic h came the Am shaspands and Devs; was divided into two halves, and equally apportion ed between the Good and Evil Constell ations and Angels. Thos e of Spring, as for example Aries and Taurus, Auriga and Capella, were the beneficent stars; and those of Autu mn, as the Balance, Scor pio, the Serpent of Ophiucus, and the Dragon of the Hesperides, were types and subjects of the Evil Principle, an d regarded as malevolent c auses of the ill effects experienced in Autumn a nd Winter. Thus are expl ained the mysteries of the journeyings of t he human soul through th e spheres, when it descends to the earth by the Sign of the Serpent, and returns to the Empire of light by that of the Lamb or Bull. The creative action of Heaven was manifested, and a ll its demiurgic energy developed, most of all at the Vernal Equinox, to which refer all the fables that typify th e victory of Light over Da rkness, by the triumphs of Jupiter, Osiris, Ormuzd, and Apollo. Always the triumphant god takes the form of the Bull, the Ram, or the Lamb. Then Jupiter wrests from Typhon his t hunderbolts, of which that malignant Deity had possessed himself during the Wint er. Then the God of Light overwhelms his foe, pict ured as a huge Se rpent. Then Wint er ends; the Sun, seated on the Bull and accompanied by Orion, blazes in the Heavens. All nature rejo ices at the victory; a nd Order and Harmony are everywhere re-established , in place of th e dire confusion that reigned while gloomy Typhon domi neered, and Ahriman prevailed against Ormuzd. The universal Soul of the World, mo tive power of Heav en and of the Spheres, it was hel d, exercises its creative energy chiefly through the medium of the Sun, during his revolu tion along the signs of the Zodiac, with which signs unite the paranatellons that modify their influence, and concur in furnishing the symbolic attributes of t he Great Luminary that regulates Nature and is the depository of her greatest powers. The action of this Universal Soul of the World is disp layed in the movements of the Spheres, and above all in that of the Sun, in the successions of the risings and settings of the Stars, and in their periodical returns. By these are ex plainable all the me tamorphoses of that Soul, personified as Jupiter, as Bacchus, as Vishnu, or as Buddha, and all the various attrib utes ascribed to it; and also the worship of those animals that were consecra ted in the anci ent Temples, representatives on earth of the Cele stial Signs, and supposed to receive by transmission from them the rays and emanations which in them flow from th e Universal Soul. All the old Adorers of Nature, the Theologians, As trologers, and Poets, as well as the most distinguish ed Philosophers, supposed that the Stars were so many animated and intelligent bei ngs, or eternal bodies, active causes of effect here below, an imated by a living principle, and directed by an intelligence that was itself but an emanat ion from and a part of the life and universal intelligen ce of the world: and we find in the hierarchical order and distributi on of their eter nal and divine Intelligences, known by the names of Gods, Angels, and Genii, the same distributions and the same divisions as those by whic h the ancients divi ded the visible"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"Universe and distributed its parts. And the fam ous divisions by seven and by twelve, appertaini ng to the planets and the signs of the zodiac, is everywhere found in the hierarchical order of the Gods, and Angels, and the other Ministers that are the depositaries of that Divine Force which moves and ru les the world. These, and the other Inte lligences assigned to th e other Stars, have absolute dominion over all parts of Nature; over the elements, the animal and vegetable kin gdoms, over man and all his actions, over his virtues and vices, and ov er good and evil, which divide between them his life. The passions of his soul and the maladies of his body, - these and the entire man are dep endent on the heavens and the genii that there inhabit, who preside at his birth, control hi s fortunes during life, and receive his soul or active and intelligent pa rt when it is to be reunited to the pure life of the lofty Stars. And all th rough the great body of the world are disse minated portions of the universal Soul, impressing movement on ever ything that seems to mo ve of itself, giving life to the plants a nd trees, directing by a regu lar and settled plan the organization and devel opment of their germs, imparting constant mobility to the running waters and maintaining their eternal motion, impelling the winds and changing their directi on or stilling them, calming and arousi ng the ocean, unchaining the storm pouring out the fires of volcanoes, or with earthquakes shaki ng the roots of huge mountains and the foundatio ns of vast continents; by means of a force that, belonging to Nature, is a mystery to man. And these invisible Intelligences, like the stars, are marshalled in two great divisions, unde r the banners of the two Principles of Good and Evil, Light and Da rkness; under Ormuzd and Ahriman, Osiris and Typhon. The Evil Principle was the mo tive power of br ute matter; and it, personified as Ahriman and Typhon, had its hosts and armies of Devs and Genii, Fallen Angels and Malevolent Spirits, who waged continual wage with the Go od Principle, the Principl e of Empyreal Light and Splendor, Osiris, Ormu zd, Jupiter or Dionusos, with his bright hosts of Amshaspands, Izeds, Angels, and Archangels; a warfare that goes on from birth until dea th, in the soul of ev ery man that lives. We have heretofore, in the 24th Degree recited the principal incidents in the legend of Osir is and Isis, and it re mains but to point out the astronomical phenom ena which it has convert ed into mythological facts. The Sun, at the Vernal Eq uinox, was the fruit-compel ling star that by his warmth provoked generat ion and poured up on the sublunary world all the blessings of Heaven; the beneficent god, tu telary genius of universal vegetation, that communica tes to the dull ear th new activity, and stirs her great heart, long chilled by Winter and his fr osts, until from her bosom burst all the greenness and perfume of spring, making he r rejoice in l eafy forests and grassy lawns and flower-enamelled meadows, and th e promise of abundant crops of grai n and fruits and purple grapes in their due season. He was then called Osiris, Husband of Isis, God of Cultivation and Benefactor of Men, p ouring on them and on t he earth the choicest blessings within the gift of the Divinity. Opposed to him was Typhon, his antagonist in the Egyptian mythology, as Ahriman was the foe of Ormuzd,"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"the Good Principle, in the theology of the Persians. The first inhabitants of Egypt and Ethiopia, as Diodorus Siculus informs us, saw in the Heavens tw o first eternal causes of th ings, or great Divinities, one the Sun, whom they called Osiris, and the other the Mo on, whom they called Isis; and these they considered the causes of all the generations of earth. This idea, we lear n from Eusebius, was the same as that of the Phœnicians. On these two great Divinities the admi nistration of the world depended. All sublunary bodies received from them their nourishment and increase, during the annual revolution which they cont rolled, and the different seasons into wh ich it was divided. To Osiris and Isis, it was held, were owing civilization, the discovery of agriculture, laws, arts of all kinds, religious worship, temples, the invention of letters, astronomy, the gymnastic ar ts, and music; and thus they were the universal benefactors. Osiris travelled to civilize the countries which he passed through, and communi cate to them his valu able discoveries. He built cities, and ta ught men to cultiv ate the earth. Wheat and wine were his first presents to men. Europe, Asia, and Africa par took of the blessings which he communicated, and the most remote regions of India remembered him, and claimed him as on e of their great gods. You have learned how Typhon, his brother, slew hi m. His body was cut into pieces, all of which were coll ected by Isis, except his organs of generation, wh ich had been thrown into and devour ed in the waters of the river that every year fe rtilized Egypt. The other portions were buried by Isis, and over them she erec ted a tomb. Thereafte r she remained single, loading her subjects with blessings. She cu red the sick, restored sight to the blind, made the paralytic whole, and even raised the dead. From her Horus or Apollo learned divinatio n and the science of medicine. Thus the Egyptians pictur ed the beneficent action of the two luminaries that, from the bosom of the elements, produced all animals and men, and all bodies that are born, grow, and die in the eterna l circle of generation and destruction he re below. When the Celestial Bull o pened the new year at the Vernal Equinox, Osiris, united with the Moon, comm unicated to her the seed s of fruitfulness which she poured upon the air, and therewith impre gnated the generative principles which gave acti vity to universal vegetatio n. Apis, represented by a bull, was the living and sensible image of the Sun or Osiris , when in union with Isis or the Moon at the Vernal Equinox, concurring with her in provoking everything that lives to generation. This conjunction of the Sun with the Moon at the Ver nal Equinox, in the conste llation Taurus, required the Bull Apis to have on his shoulder a mark resembling the Crescent Moon. And the fecundatin g influence of these two luminaries was expressed by images that would no w be deemed gross and indecent, but which then were not misunderstood. Everything good in Nature comes from Osiris, - order, harmony, and the favorable temperature of the seasons and celestial periods. From Typhon come the stormy passions and irregular impulses that agitate the brute and material part of man; mal adies of the body, and violent sho cks that injure the health and de range the system; inclement w eather, derangement of the seasons, and eclipses. Os iris and Typhon we re the Ormuzd and Ahriman of the Persians; principles of good and evil, of light and darkness, ever at war"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"in the administration of the Universe. Osiris was the image of generative power. This was expressed by his symbolic statues, and by th e sign into which he en tered at the Vernal Equinox. He especially dis pensed the humid principle of Nature, generative element of all thin gs; and the Nile a nd all moisture we re regarded as emanations from him, without which ther e could be no vegetation. That Osiris and Isis were t he Sun and Moon, is attested by many ancient writers; by Diogenes Laertius, Plut arch, Lucian, Suidas, Macrobius, Martianus Capella, and others. Hi s power was symbolized by an Eye over a Sceptre. The Sun was termed by t he Greeks the Eye of Jupiter, and the Eye of the World; and his is the All-Seeing Eye in our Lodges. The oracle of Claros styled him King of the Stars and of the Eternal Fire, that engenders the year and t he seasons, dispenses rain and winds, and brings about daybreak and nigh t. And Osiris was invoked as the God that resides in the Sun an d is enveloped by his rays, the invisible and eter nal force that modifies the sublunary world by means of the Sun. Osiris was the same God known as Bacchus, Dionusos, and Serapis. Serapis is the author of the regularit y and harmony of the world. Bacchus, jointly with Cere s (identified by Herodotus with Isis) presides over the distribution of all our blessings; and from the two emanates everything beautiful and good in Nature. One furnishes the germ and principle of every good; the other receives a nd preserves it as a deposit; and the la tter is the function of the Moon in th e theology of the Persians. In each theology, Persia n and Egyptian, the Moon acts directly on the earth; but she is fecundated, in on e by the Celestial Bull and in the other by Osir is, with whom she is un ited at the Vernal Equinox, in the sign Taur us, the place of her ex altation or greatest influence on the earth. The force of Osiris, says Pl utarch, is exercised through the Moon. She is the passive cause relative ly to him, and the active cause relatively to the earth, to which she transm its the germs of fruitfulness receiv ed from him. In Egypt the earliest movement in the waters of the Nile began to appear at the Vernal Eq uinox, when the new M oon occurred at the entrance of the Sun into the conste llation Taurus; and thus the Nile was held to receive its fertilizing powe r from the combined action of the equinoctial Sun and the ne w Moon, meeting in Taur us. Osiris was often confounded with the Nile, and Isis with the earth; and Osiris was deemed to act on the earth , and to transmit to it his emanations, through both the Moon and the Nile; whence t he fable that his generative organs were thrown into that river. Typ hon, on the other hand, was the principle of aridity and barrenness; a nd by his mutilation of Osiris was meant that. drought which caused the Nile to retire within his bed and shrink up in Autumn. Elsewhere than in Egypt, Os iris was the symbol of the refreshing rains that descend to fertilize the earth; and Typhon the bu rning winds of Autumn; the stormy rains that rot t he flowers, the plant s, and leaves; the short, cold days; a nd everything injurious in Nature, and that produces corruption and destruction. In short, Typhon is the principle of co rruption, of darkne ss, of the lower"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"world from which come earthquakes, tu multuous commotions of the air, burning heat, light ning, and fiery me teors, and plague and pestilence. Such too was the Ah riman of the Persians; and th is revolt of the Evil Principle against t he Principle of Good and Light, has been represented in every cosmogony, under many varying forms. Osiris, on the contrary, by the intermediation of Isis, fills the material world with happiness, purity, and or der, by which the harmony of Nature is maintained. t was said that he died at the Autumnal Equinox, when Taurus or the Pleiades rose in the evening, and that he rose to life again in \"lie Spring, when vegetation was inspired with new activity. Of course the two signs of Taurus and Scorpio wi ll figure most largely in the mythological histor y of Osiris, for they ma rked the two equinoxes, 2500 years before our Era; and next to them the other constellations, near the equinoxes, that fi xed the limits of the durat ion of the fertilizing action of the Sun; and it is also to be re marked that Venus, the Goddess of Generation, has her domicile in Taur us, as the Moon has there her place of exaltation. When the Sun was in Scorpio, Osiris lost his li fe, and that fruitfulness which, under the form of the Bull, he had communi cated, through the Moon, to the Earth. Ty phon, his hands and feet horrid wit h serpents, and whose habitat in the Egyptian planisphere was under Scorpio, confined him in a chest and flung him into t he Nile, under the 17th degree of Scorpio. Under t hat sign he lost his life and vi rility; and he recovered them in the Sp ring, when he had connection wi th the Moon. When he entered Scorpio, his light diminished, Night reassumed her dominion, the Nile shrunk within it s banks, and the earth lost her verdure and the trees their leaves. Therefore it is that on the Mithriac Monuments, the Scorpion bites the test icles of the Equinoctial Bull, on which sits Mithras, the Sun of Spring and God of Generation; and that, on the same monuments, we see tw o trees, one covered with young leaves, and at its foot a little bull and a torch bur ning; and the other loaded with fruit, and at its foot a Scorpi on, and a torch reversed and extinguished. Ormuzd or Osiris, the ben eficent Principle that gi ves the world light, was personified by the Sun, apparen t source of lig ht. Darkness, personified by Typhon or Ahriman, was his natur al enemy. The Sages of Egypt described the necessary and eternal rivalry or opposition of these principles, ever pursuing one the other, and one dethroning the other in every annual revo lution, and at a particula r period, on e in the Spring under the Bull, an d the other in Autumn und er the Scorpion, by the legendary history of Os iris and Typhon, detailed to us by Diodorus and Synesius; in which history were also personified the Stars and constellations Orion, Capella, t he Twins, the Wolf , Sirius, and Hercules, whose risings and settings noted the advent of one or the other equinox. Plutarch gives us the po sitions in the Heavens of the Sun and Moon, at the moment when Osiris was murdered by Typhon. The Sun, he says, was in the Sign of the Scorpion, which he then ent ered at the Autumnal Equinox. The Moon was full, he adds; and c onsequently, as it rose at sunset, it occupied Taurus, which, oppo site to Scorpio, rose as it and"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"the Sun sank together, so that she was then found alone in the sign Taurus, where, six m onths before, she h ad been in union or conjunction with Osiris, the Sun, re ceiving from him those germs of universal fertilization which he commun icated to her. It was the sign through which Osiris first ascended into his empire of li ght and good. It rose with the Sun on the day of the Vernal Equi nox; it remained six months in the luminous hemisphere, ever preceding the Sun and above the horizon during th e day; until in Au tumn, the Sun arrivi ng at Scorpio, Taurus was in complete opposition with him, rose when he set, and completed its entire course above the horizon during the night; presiding, by rising in the evening, over the co mmencement of the long nights. Hence in the sad ceremonies commemo rating the death of Osiris, there was borne in procession a golden bull covered with black crape, image of the dark ness into which the famili ar sign of Osiris was entering, and which was to spread over the Northe rn regions, while the Sun, prolonging the night s, was to be absent, and each to remain under the dominion of Ty phon, Principle of Ev il and Darkness. Setting out from the sign Taurus, Is is, as the Moon, went seeking for Osiris through all t he superior signs, in each of which she became full in the succe ssive months from the Au tumnal to t he Vernal Equinox, without finding him in either. Let us follow her in her allegorical wanderings. Osiris was slain by Typhon his rival, with whom conspi red a Queen of Ethiopia, by whom, says Plutarch, were designated t he winds. The paranatellons of Scorpio, the sign occupied by th e Sun when Osiris was slain, were the Serpents, reptiles which suppl ied the attributes of the Evil Genii and of Typhon, who himself bore the form of a serpent in the Egyptian planisphere. And in the division of Scorpio is also found Cassiopeia, Queen of Ethi opia, whose setting brin gs stormy winds. Osiris descended to the s hades or infernal region s. There he took the name of Serapis, i dentical with Pluto, and assu med his nature. He was then in conjunction with Serpentari us, identical with Æsculapius, whose form he took in his passa ge to the lower signs, where he takes the names of Pluto and Ades. Then Isis wept for the death of Osiris, and the gol den bull covered with crape was carried in pr ocession. Nature mourn ed the impending loss of her Summer glories, and t he advent of the empire of night, the withdrawing of the waters, made fruitful by the Bull in Sp ring, the cessation of the winds that brought rains to swel l the Nile, the shorteni ng of the days, and the despoiling of the eart h. Then Taurus, directly opp osite the Sun, entered into the cone of shadow which the earth projects, by which the Moon is eclipsed at full, and with which, making night, the Bull rises and descends as if covered with a veil, while he remains above our horizon. The body of Osiris, enclosed in a chest or coffin, was cast into the Nile. Pan and the Satyrs, near Chemmis, first discover ed his death, announced it by their cries, and everywhere created sorrow and alarm. Taurus, with the full Moon, then entered into the cone of shadow, a nd under him was the Celestial River, most properly called the Nile, an d below, Perseus, the God of Chemmis, and Au riga, leading a sh e-goat, himself i dentical with Pan, whose wife Aiga th e she-goat was styled."},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"Then Isis went in search of the body. She first met certain children who had seen it, received from them their informa tion, and gave them in return the gift of divination. T he second full Moon occurred in Gemini, the Twins, who presided over the oracles of Didy mus, and one of wh om was Apollo, the God of Divination. She learned that Osiris had, through mistak e, had connecti on with her sister Nephte, which she discovered by a crown of leaves of the melilot, which he had left behi nd him. Of this connection a child was born, whom Isis, aided by her dogs, sought for, foun d, reared, and attached to herself, by the name of Anubi s, her faithful guardian. The third full Moon occurs in Cancer, domicile of the Moon . The paranatellons of that sign are, the crown of Ariadne or Proserpine, made of le aves of the melilot, Procyon and Canis Major, one star of which was call ed the Star of Isis, while Sirius himself wa s honored in Egypt under the name of Anubis. Isis repaired to Byblos, and seated herself near a fountain, where she was found by the women of the Court of a King. She was induced to visit his Court, and became the nu rse of his son. The four th full Moon was in Leo, domicile of the Sun, or of Adonis, King of Byblos. The paranatellons of this si gn are the flow ing water of Aquarius, and Cephens, King of Ethiopia, called Regulus, or si mply The King. Behind him rise Cassiopeia his wife, Queen of Ethiopia, Andromeda his daughter, and Perseus his son-in-law, all paranatello ns in part of this sign, and in part of Virgo. Isis suckled the child, not at her breast, but with th e end of her finger, at night. She burned all t he mortal parts of its body, and then, taking the shape of a swallow, she fl ew to the great column of the palace, made of the tamarisk-tree that gr ew up round the coffin c ontaining the body of Osiris, and within which it was stil l enclosed. The fi fth full Moon occurred in Virgo, the true image of Isis , and which Eratosthenes calls by that name. It pictur ed a woman suckling an infa nt, the son of Isis, born near the Winter Sols tice. This sign has for paranatellons the mast of the Celestial Ship, and the swallo w-tailed fish or swallow above it, and a portion of Perseus, son-in-law of the King of Ethiopia. Isis, having recovered the sacred coffer , sailed from Byblos in a vessel with the eldest son of the King, toward Boutos, where Anubis was, having charge of her son Ho rus; and in the mornin g dried up a river, whence arose a strong wi nd. Landing, she hid the coffer in a forest. Typhon, hunting a wild boar by moonlight, discove red it, recognized the body of his rival, and cut it into fourt een pieces, the number of days between the full and new Moon, and in every o ne of which days the Moon loses a portion of the light that at the commencemen t filled her whole disk. The sixth full Moon occurred in Libr a over the divisions separating which from Virgo are the Celestial Ship, Pe rseus, son of the Ki ng of Ethiopia and Boötes, said to have nursed Horus. The river of Orio n that sets in the morning is also a pa ranatellon of Libr a, as are Ursa Major, the Great Bear or Wild B oar of Erymanthus, and the Dragon of the North Pole or the celebrated Python from wh ich the attributes of Typhon were borrowed.

Isis collects the scattered fragments of the body of Osiris, buries them, and consecrates the phallus, carried in pomp at the Pamylia, or feasts of the Vernal Equinox, at which time the congre ss of Osiris and the Moon was celebrated. Then Osiris had returned from the shades, to aid Horus his son and Isis his wife against the forces of Typhon. He thus reappeared, say some, under the form of a wolf, or, other s say, under that of a horse. The M oon, fourteen days after sh e is full in Libra, arrives at Taurus and unites herse lf to the Sun, whose fires she thereafter for fourteen day s continues to accumula te on her disk from new Moon to full. Then she unites with herself all the m onths in that superior portion of the wo rld where light always re igns, with harmony and order, and she bo rrows from him t he force which is to destroy the germs of evil that Typhon had, during the winter, planted everywhere in nature. This passage of the Sun in to Taurus, whose attributes he assumes on his return from the lowe r hemisphere or t he shades, is marked by the rising in the evening of the Wolf and the Centaur, and by the heliacal se tting of Orion, called the Star of Horus, and which thenceforward is in conj unction with the Sun of Spring, in his triumph over the darkne ss or Typhon. Isis, during the absence of Osiris, and after she had hid den the coffer in the place where Typho n found it, had rejoined that malignant enemy; indignant at which, Horu s her son deprived her of her ancient diadem when she rejoined Osiris as lie was about to attack Typhon: but Mercury gave her in its place a helm et shaped like the head of a bull. Then Horus, as a mighty warrior, such as Orion was de scribed, fought with and defeated Ty phon; who, in the shape of the Serp ent or Dragon of the Pole, had assailed his father . So, in Ovid, Apollo destroys the same Python, when Io, fa scinated by Jupiter, is metamorphosed into a cow, and placed in the si gn of the Celestial Bu ll, where she becomes Isis. The equi noctial year ends at t he moment when the Sun and Moon, at the Vernal Equinox, are united with Orion, the Star of Ho rns, placed of in the Heavens under Taurus. The new Mo on becomes young again in Taurus, and shows herself as a crescent, for the fi rst time, in the next sign, Gemini, the domicile of Mercury. Then Orion, in conjunction with the Sun, with whom he rises, precipit ates the Scorpion, his rival, into the shades of night, caus ing him to set he whenever he himself reappears on the eastern horizon, with th e Sun. Day lengt hens and the germs of evil are by degrees eradicated: and Horus (from Aur, Light) reigns triumphant, symbolizi ng, by his succession to the characteristics of Osiris, the eternal r enewal of the Sun's youth and creative vigor at the Vernal of Equinox.

How, or by what intermediates He creates and acts, and in what way He unfolds and manifests Hims elf, Masonry leaves to creeds and Religi ons to inquire. To every Mason, the soul of man is immortal. Whether it emanates from and will return to God, and what its cont inued mode of existence hereafter, each judges for himself. Masonry was not made to settle that. To every Mason, WISD OM or INTELLIGENCE, FORCE or STRENGTH, and HARMONY, or FITNES S and BEAUTY, are th e Trinity of the attributes of God. With the subtleties of Phil osophy concerning them Masonry does not meddle, nor decide as to the r eality of the supposed Existences which are their Personific ations: nor whether the Christian"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"Trinity be such a personification, or a Reality of the grav est import and significance. To every Mason, the Infinite justice and Benevolence of God give ample assurance that Evil will ultimately be dethroned, and the Good, the True, and the Beautiful reign triu mphant and eter nal. It teaches, as it feels and knows, that Evil, and Pain, and Sorrow exist as part of a wise and beneficent plan, all the pa rts of which work together under Go d's eye to a result which shall be perfection. Whethe r the existence of evil is rightly explained in this creed or in that, by Typhon t he Great Serpent, by Ahriman and his Armies of Wicked Spirits, by the Gi ants and Titans that war against Heaven, by the two co-existent Prin ciples of Go od and Evil, by Satan's temptation and t he fall of Man, by Lok and the Serpent Fenris, it is beyond the dom ain of Masonry to decide, nor does it need to inquire. Nor is it within its Province to determ ine how the ultimate triumph of Light and Truth and Good, over Da rkness and Error and Evil, is to be achieved; nor whether the R edeemer, looked a nd longed for by all nations, hath appeared in Judea, or is yet to come. It reverences all the great reformers. It sees in Moses, t he Lawgiver of the Jews, in Confucius and Zoroaster, in Jesus of Nazareth, and in the Arabian Iconoclast, Great Teachers of Morality, and Eminent Reformers, if no more: and allows every brother of the Order to assign to each such higher and even Divine Character as his Creed and Truth require. Thus Masonry disbelieves no truth, and teaches unbelief in no creed, except so far as such creed may lowe r its lofty estimate of the Deity, degrade Him to the level of the passi ons of humanity, deny the high destiny of man, impug n the goodness and benevole nce of the Supreme God, strike at those great columns of Masonry, Fait h, Hope, and Charity, or inculcate immorality, and disregard of the active duties of the Order. Masonry is a worship; but one in which all civiliz ed men can unite; for it does not undertake to expl ain or dogmatically to settle those great mysteries, that are above the fe eble comprehension of our human intellect. It trusts in God, and HOPES; it BELIEV ES, like a child, and is humble. It draws no sword to compel others to adopt its belief, or to be happy with its hopes. Arid it WAITS with patience to understand the mysteries of Nature and Nature's God hereafter. The greatest mysteries in the Universe are those which ar e ever going on around us; so trite and comm on to us that we never note them nor reflect upon them. Wise men te ll us of the laws that r egulate the motions of the spheres, which, flashing in huge circ les and spinning on their axes, are also ever darting with in conceivable rapidity thro ugh the infinities of Space; while we atoms sit here, and dream that all was made for us. They tell us learnedly of c entripetal and c entrifugal forces, gravity and attraction, and all the othe r sounding terms invented to hide a want of meaning. There are other forces in the Universe than those that are mechanical. Here are two minute seed s, not much unlike in a ppearance, and two of larger size. Hand them to the learned Pundit, Chemis try, who tells us how combustion goes on in t he lungs, and plants are fed with phosphorus and carbon, and the alkalies and silex. Let her de compose them, analyze them, torture them in all the ways she knows. The net result of each is a"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"little sugar, a little fibr in, a little wate r - carbon, potassi um, sodium, and the like - one cares not to know what. We hide them in the grou nd: and the sl ight rains moiste n them, and the Sun shines upon them, and little slender s hoots spring up and grow; - and what a miracle is the mere growth! - the force, the power, the capacity by which the little feeble shoot, that a sm all worm can nip off with a single snap of its mandibles, extracts from the earth and ai r and water the different elements, so le arnedly catalogued, with which it increases in stature, and rise s imperceptibly toward the sky. One grows to be a slender, fr agile, feeble stal k, soft of texture, like an ordinary weed; another a strong bush, of woody fibr e, armed with thorns, and sturdy enough to bid de fiance to the winds : th e third a tender tree, subject to be blighted by the frost, and look ed down upon by all the forest; while another spreads its rugged arms abroad, and cares for neither frost no r ice, nor the snows that for months lie ar ound its roots. But lo! out of the brown fo ul earth, and colorless invi sible air, and limpid rain-water, the chemis try of the seeds has extracte d colors - four different shades of green, that paint the leaves which put fort h in the spring upon our plants, our shrubs, and our trees. Later still come the flowers - the vivid colors of the rose, the beautiful brillianc e of the carnation, the modest blush of the apple, and th e splendid white of the orange. Whence co me the colors of the leaves and flowers? By what process of chemis try are they extracted from the carbon, the phosphorus, and the lime? Is it any greater miracle to make something out of nothing? Pluck the flowers. Inhale the delicious perfumes ; each perfect, and all delicious. Whence have they come? By what combinatio n of acids and alkalies could the chemist's laboratory produce them? And now on two comes the fruit - the ruddy apple and the golden orange. Pluck them - open th em! The texture and fabric how totally different! The taste how entirely dissimila r - the perfume of each distinct from its flower and from the other. When ce the taste and this new perfume? The same earth and air and water have been made to furnish a different taste to each fruit, a different perfume not only to each fruit, but to each fruit and its own flower. Is it any more a problem whence come thought and will and perception and all the phenomena of the mind, than this, whence come the colors, the perfumes, the taste, of the fruit and flower? And lo! in each fruit new seeds, each gifted with t he same wondrous power of reproduction - each with the same wondrou s forces wrapped up in it to be again in turn evolved. Forces that had lived thre e thousand years in the grain of wheat found in the wrappings of an Egyptian mummy; forces of which learning and science and wisdom know no more than they do of the nature and laws of action of God. What can we know of the nature, and how can we understand t he powers and mode of operation of the human soul, when the glossy leaves , the pearl-white flower, and the golden fruit of the orange are miracles wholly beyond our co mprehension? We but hide our i gnorance in a cloud of words; - and the words too often are mere combinations of s ounds without any meaning. What is the centrifugal forc e?

These too are miracles; inexplicable as the creation, or the ex istence and self-exi stence of God. Who will explain to us th e passion, the peevishness, t he anger, the memory, and affections of the small canary-wren? the consciousne ss of identity and the dreams of the dog? the reasoning powers of the el ephant? the wondrous instincts, passions, governm ent, and civil policy, and modes of co mmunication of ideas of the ant and bee? Who has yet made us to u nderstand, with all his learned words, how heat comes to us from the Sun, and light from the re mote Stars, setting out upon its journey earth-ward from some, at t he time the Chald eans commenced to build the Tower of Babel? Or how the image of an extern al object comes to a nd fixes itself upon the retina of the eye; and when there, how th at mere empty, unsubstantial image becomes transmuted in to the wondrous thing that we call SIGHT? Or how the waves of the atmosphere st riking upon the tympanum of the ear - those thin, invisible waves - produce the equally wondrous phenomenon of HEARING, and become the roar of t he tornado, the crash of the thunder, the migh ty voice of the ocean, the chirping of the cricket, the delicate swee t notes and exquisite trills and variations of the wren and mocking-bird, or the magic melody of the instrument of Paganini? Our senses are mysteries to us, and we are mysteries to ourselves. Philosophy has taught us nothing as to the nature of our sensat ions, our perceptions, our cognizances, the origin of our thoughts and ideas, but word s. By no effort or degree of reflection, never so long continued, can man become conscious of a personal identity in himself, separate an d distinct from his body and his brain. We torture ourselves in the effort to gain an idea of ourselves, and weary with the exertion. Who has yet made us understand how, from the contact with a foreign body, the im age in the eye, the wave of air impinging on the ear, particular particles en tering the nostrils, a nd coming in contact with the palate, come sensations in the nerves, and from that, perception in the mind, of the animal or the man? What do we know of S ubstance? Men even doubt ye t whether it exists. Philosophers tell us th at our senses make known to us only the attributes of substance, extension, hardness, color, and the like; but not the thing itself that is extended, solid, black or white; as we know the attributes of the Soul, its thoughts and its percept ions, and not the So ul itself which perceives and thinks. What a wondrous mystery is th ere in heat and li ght, existing, we know not how, within certain limits, narrow in comparison with in finity, beyond which on every side stretch out infi nite space and the blackness of unimaginable da rkness, and the intensity of inconceiva ble cold! Think only of t he mighty Power required to maintain warmth and light in the central point of such an infinity, to whose darkness that of Mi dnight, to whose cold that of the last Arctic Island is nothing. And yet GOD is everywhere. And what a mystery are the e ffects of heat and cold upon the wondrous fluid that we call water! What a myst ery lies hidden in every flak e of snow and in every crystal of ice, and in their final transformat ion into the invisibl e vapor that rises from the ocean or the land , and floats above the summ its of the mountains!

In finite SPACE, st retching out from us every way, without limit: infinite TIME, without beginning or end; and WE, HERE, and NOW, in the centre of each ! An infinity of s uns, the nearest of which only diminish in size, viewed with the most powe rful telescope: each with its retinue of worlds; infinite numbers of su ch suns, so remote from us that their light would not r each us, journeying duri ng an infinity of time, while the light that has reached us, from some that we seem to see, has been upon its journey for fifty centuries: ou r world spinning u pon its axis, and rushing ever in its circuit round the sun; an d it, the sun, an d all our system re volving round some great central point; and that, and suns, stars, and worlds evermore flashing onward with incr edible rapidity through il limitable space: and then, in every drop of water that we drink, in every morsel of much of our food, in the air, in the ea rth, in the sea, incredibl e multitudes of living creatures, invisible to the naked eye, of a minutene ss beyond belief, yet organized, living, feedin g, perhaps with conscious ness of identity, and memory and instinct. Such are some of the myst eries of the grea t Universe of G od. And yet we, whose life and that of the world on which we live fo rm but a point in the centre of infinite Time: we, who nouris h animalculæ within, and on whom vegetables grow without, wo uld fain learn how God cr eated this Universe, would understand Hi s Powers, His Attributes, Hi s Emanations, His Mode of Existence and of Action; would fain know the plan a ccording to which all events proceed, that plan profou nd as God Himself; would know the laws by which He controls His Universe; would fain see and talk to Him face to face, as man talks to man: a nd we try not to believe, because we do not understand.

The Triple Triangle. Qu.·. Of what else is it the symbol to us? Ans.·. Of the Trinity of Attr ibutes of the Deity; and of the triple essence of Man, the Principle of Life, the Intellectual Power, a nd the Soul or Immortal Emanation from the Deity. Qu.·. What is the first great Tr uth of the Sacred Mysteries? Ans.·. No man hath seen God at any ti me. He is One, Eternal, All- Powerful, All-Wise, Infinitely ju st, Merciful, Benevolent, and Compassionate, Creator and Preserver of all thi ngs, the Source of Light and Life, coextensive with Time and Space; Who thought, and with the Thought created the Universe and all living things, an d the souls of men: THAT IS: - the PERMANENT; while ev erything beside is a perpetual genesis.

Qu.·. What is t he third great Trut h in Masonry? Ans.·. The impulse which directs to ri ght conduct, and deter s from crime, is not only older than t he ages of nations and cities , but coeval with that Divine Being Who sees a nd rules both Heaven and ea rth. Nor did Tarquin less violate that Eternal Law, though in his reign there might have been no written law at Rome agains t such violence; for the principle that impels us to right conduct, and wa rns us against guilt, spri ngs out of the nature of things. It did not begin to be la w when it was first written, nor was it originated; but it is coeval with the Divine Intelligence itself. The consequence of virtue is not to be made the end thereof ; and laudable performances must have deep er roots, motives, and instigations, to give them the stamp of virtues. Qu.·. What is the fourth great Truth in Masonry? Ans.·. The moral truths ar e as absolute as the me taphysical truths. Even the Deity cannot make it t hat there should be effect s without a cause, or phenomena without substance. As little could he make it to be sinful and evil to respect our pledged word, to love truth, to moderate our passions. The principles of Mo rality are axioms, like the pr inciples of Geometry. The moral laws are the necessary relations that flow from the nature of things, and they are not created by, but have ex isted eternally in God. Their continued existence does not depend upo n the exercise of His WILL. Truth and Justice are of His ESSENCE. Not becaus e we are feeble and God omnipotent, is it our duty to obey His law. We may be forced, but are not under obligation, to obey the stronger. God is the principle of Morality, but not by His mere will, which, abstracted from all other of His attributes, would be neither just nor unj ust. Good is the expression of His will, in so far as that will is itse lf the expression of eter nal, absolute , uncreated justice, which is in God, which His will did not create ; but which it executes and promulgates , as our will proclaim s and promulgates and executes the idea of the good which is in us. He has given us the law of Truth and justice; but He has not arbitrarily institut ed that law. justice is inherent in His wi ll, because it is contain ed in His intelligence and wisdom, in His very nature and most intimate essence. Qu.·. What is the fifth gr eat Truth in Masonry? Ans.·. There is an essential distinctio n between Good and Evil, what is just and what is unjust; and to this distinction is a ttached, for every intelligent and free creature, the absolute obligati on of conforming to what is good and just. Man is an intelligent and free being, - free, because he is conscious that it is his du ty, and because it is made his duty, to obey the dictates of truth and ju stice, and therefore he mu st necessarily have the power of doing so, which involves the power of not doing so; - capable of comprehending the dist inction between good and evil, justice and injustice, and the obligation which a ccompanies it, and of naturally adhering to that ob ligation, independent ly of any con-"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"tract or positive law; capable also of resisting the tempta tions which urge him toward evil and injustice, and of complying wit h the sacred law of eternal justice. That man is not governed by a resistless Fate or inexorable Destiny; but is free to choose between the evil a nd the good: that justice and Right, the Good and Beauti ful, are of the e ssence of the Divi nity, like His Infinitude; and therefore they are laws to man: that we are conscious of our freedom to act, as we are con scious of our iden tity, and the continuance and connected ness of our existence; and have the same evidence of one as of t he other; and if we can pu t one in doubt, we have no certainty of either, and everything is unreal: that we can deny our free will and free agency, only u pon the ground that they are in the nature of things impossible; whic h would be to deny the Omnipotence of God. Qu.·. What is the sixth gr eat Truth of Masonry? Ans.·. The necessity of practising th e moral truths, is obligation. The moral truths, necessary in the eye of reason, are obligatory on the will. The moral obligation, like t he moral truth that is its foundation, is absolute. As the necessary truths are not more or less necessary, so the obligation is not more or less obligatory. Ther e are degrees of importance among different obligations; but none in the obl igation itself. We are not nearly obliged, almost obliged. We are wholly so, or not at all. If there be any place of refuge to which we can escape from the obligation, it ceases to exist. If the obligation is absolute, it is immutable a nd universal. For if that of to-day may not be that of to-morrow, if what is obligator y on me may not be obligatory on you, the obligation would differ from itself, and be variable and contingent. This fact is the principl e of all morality. That every act contrary to right and justice, deserves to be repressed by force, and punished when co mmitted, equally in the absence of any law or contract: that man naturally recognizes the distinction be tween the merit and demerit of actions, as he does that between ju stice and injustice, honesty and dishonesty; and feels, without being taught, and in the absence of law or contract, that it is wrong for vice to be rewa rded or go unpunished, and for virtue to be punished or left unrewarded: and that, the Deity being infinitely ju st and good, it must foll ow as a necessary and inflexible law that punishm ent shall be the result of Sin, its inevitable and natural effect and corollary, and not a mere arbitrary vengeance. Qu.·. What is the seventh great Truth in Masonry? Ans.·. The immutable law of God requires, that besides re specting the absolute rights of others, and being merely just, we should do good, be charitable, and obey the dictates of the generou s and noble sentiments of the soul. Charity is a law, because our conscience is not satisfied nor at ease if we have not reli eved the suffering, the distressed, and the destitute. It is to give th at which he to whom you gi ve has no right to take or demand. To be charitab le is obligatory on us. We are the Almoners of God's bounties. But the obligation is not so precise and inflexible as the obligation to be just. Char ity knows neither rule nor limit. It goes beyond all obligation. Its beauty cons ists in its liberty. \"He th at loveth not, knoweth not God; FOR GOD IS LOVE . If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and His love is perfected in us. God is love; and he th at dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.\" To be kindly af fectioned one to another"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"with brotherly love; to relieve the necessities of the needy, and be generous, liberal, and ho spitable; to return to no man evil for evil ; to rejoice at the good fortune of others, and sympathize with them in their sorrows and reverses; to li ve peaceably with all men, and re pay injuries with benefits and kindn ess; these are the sublime dictates of the Moral Law, taught from the infancy of the world, by Masonry. Qu.·. What is the eighth gr eat Truth in Masonry? Ans.·. That the law which control and regulate the Universe of God, are those of motion and harm ony. We see only the is olated, incidents of things, and with our feeble and limited c apacity and, vision cannot discern their connection, nor the mighty chords, that make the apparent discord perfect harmony. Evil is merely apparent, and all is in re ality good and perfect. For pain and sorrow, persecut ion and hardships, affliction and destitution, sickness and death are but the means, by which alone the noblest, virtues could be developed. Without them, and without sin and error, and wrong and outr age, as there can be no effect without an adequate cause, there co uld be neither patience under suffering and distress; nor prudence in difficulty; nor temperance to avoid excess; nor courage to meet danger; nor truth, when to speak the truth is hazardous; nor love, when it is me t with ingrat itude; nor charity for the needy and destitute; nor forbearance and forgiveness of injuri es; nor toleration of erroneous opinions; nor c haritable judgment and construction of men's motives and actions; nor patriotism, nor heroism, nor honor, nor self -denial, nor generosity. These and most other virtues and exce llencies would have no existence, and even their names be unk nown; and the poor virtues that still existed, would scarce deserve th e name; for life w ould be one flat, dead, low level, above wh ich none of the lofty el ements of human nature would emerge; and man would lie l apped in contente d indolence and idleness, a mere worthle ss negative, instead of t he brave, strong soldier against the grim legi ons of Evil and rude Difficulty. Qu.·. What is the ninth gr eat Truth in Masonry? Ans.·. The great lead ing doctrine of this Degree ;- that the JUSTICE, the WISDOM, and the MERCY of God are alike infinite, alike perfect, and yet do not in the least jar no r conflict one with the other; but form a Great Perfect Trinity of Attribut es, three and yet one: that , the principle of merit and demerit being absolut e, and every good acti on deserving to be rewarded, and every bad one to be punished, and God being as just as He is good; and yet the cases constantly recurring in this world, in which crime and cruelty, oppress ion, tyranny, and inju stice are prosperous, happy, fortunate, and self-cont ented, and rule and reign, and enjoy all the blessings of God's bene ficence, while the vi rtuous and good are unfortunate, miserabl e, destitute, pining away in dungeons, pe rishing with cold, and famishing with hunger, slaves of oppre ssion, and in struments and victims of the miscr eants that govern; so that th is world, if there were no existence beyond it, would be one gr eat theatre of wrong and injustice, proving God wholly disregar dful of His ow n necessary law of merit and demerit; - it follows that there must be another life in wh ich these apparent wrongs shall be repaired: That all the powers of man's soul tend to infinity; and his indo mitable instinct of immortalit y, and the universal hope"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"of another life, testified by all creeds, all po etry, all traditions, establish its certainty; for man is not an orphan; but hath a Fa ther near at hand: and the day must come when Li ght and Truth, and the just and Good shall be victorious, and Darkness, Error, Wron g, and Evil be annihilated, and known no more forever: That the Universe is one great Harmony, in which, according to the fait h of all nations, d eep-rooted in all hearts in the primitive ages, Light will ultimately prevail over Darkness, and the Good Principle over the Evil: a nd the myriad souls that have emanated from the Divinity, purified and e nnobled by the struggle here below, will again return to perfect bliss in the bo som of God, to offend against Whose laws will then be no longer possible. Qu.·. What, then, is the one great lesson taught to us , as Masons, in this Degree? Ans.·. That to that state and realm of Light and Trut h and Perfection, which is absolutely certain, all th e good men on earth are tending; and if there is a law from whose operation n one are exempt, which inev itably conveys their bodies to darkness a nd to dust, there is anothe r not less cert ain nor less powerful, which conducts their spirit s to that state of Happiness and Splendor and Perfection, the bosom of their Fath er and their God. The wheels of Nature are not made to roll backward. Ev erything presses on to Eternity. From the birth of Time an impetuous cu rrent has set in, which bears all the sons of men toward that interminable ocean. Meanwhile, Heaven is attracting to itse lf whatever is cogenial to its nature, is enriching itself by the spoils of the Earth, and collecting within it s capacious bosom whatever is pure, permanent , and divine, leav ing nothing for the last fire to consume but the gross matter that cr eates concupiscence; while everything fit for that good fortune sha ll be gathered and selected from the ruins of the world, to adorn t hat Eternal City. Let every Mason then obey the voice that calls him thither. Let us seek the things that are above, an d be not content with a wo rld that must shortly perish, and which we must speedily quit, while we n eglect to prepare for that in which we are invited to dwell fo rever. While everythi ng within us and around us reminds us of the approach of de ath, and concurs to teach us that this is., not our re st, let us hasten ou r preparations for another world, and earnestly implore that help and strength from our Father , which alone can put an end to t hat fatal war which our desires have too long waged with our destiny. When these move in the sa me, direction, and that which God's will renders unavoidable shall become our choice, al l things will be ours; life will be divested of its vanity, and death disarmed of its terrors. Qu.·. What are the sym bols of the purification nece ssary to make us perfect Masons? Ans.·. Lavation with pure wate r, or baptism; because to cleanse the body is emblematical of purifyi ng the soul; and because it conduces to the bodily health, and virtue is the health of the soul, as sin and vice are its malady and sickness:- unction, or anoint- ing with oil; because thereby we ar e set apart and ded icated to the service and priesthood of the Beautiful, the True, and the Good:- and robes of white, emblems of candor, purity, and truth. Qu.·. What is to us the chief symbo l of man's ultimate redemption and regeneration?"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"Ans.·. The fraternal sup per, of bread which nouris hes, and of wine which refreshes and exhilarates, symbolical of th e time which is to come, when all mankind shall be on e great harmonious brother hood; and teaching us these great lessons: that as matter changes ever, but no single atom is annihilated, it is no t rational to suppos e that the far noble r soul does not continue to exist beyond the grave: that many thousands who have died before us might claim to be joint owners with ours elves of the particles that compose our mortal bodies; for matter ever forms new combinations; and the bodies of the anci ent dead, the patriarchs before and since the flood, the kings and comm on people of all ages, re solved into their constituent elements, are carried upon the wind over all continents, and continually enter into an d form part of the habita tions of new souls, creating new bonds of sympathy and brotherh ood between each man that lives and all his race. And thus, in the bread we eat, and in the wine we drink to-night may enter in to and form part of us th e identical pa rticles of matter that once formed parts of the material bodies call ed Moses, Confucius, Plato, Socrates , or Jesus of Nazareth. In the truest sense, we eat and drink the b odies of the dead; and cannot say that th ere is a single atom of our blood or body , the ownership of which some other soul might not dispute with us. It teaches us al so the infinite benef icence of God who sends us seedtime and harvest each in its s eason, and makes His showers to fall and His sun to shine alik e upon the evil and the good: bestowing upon us unsolicited His in numerable blessings, and asking no return. For there are no angels station ed upon the watc htowers of creation to call the world to prayer and sacr ifice; but He bestows His benefits in silence, like a kind friend who comes at night, an d, leaving his gifts at the door, to be found by us in the morn ing, goes quietly away and asks no thanks, nor ceases his kind offices for our ingratitude. And thus the bread and wine te ach us that our Mortal Body is no more WE than the house in which we live, or the garments that we wear ; but the Soul is I, the ONE, identical, unc hangeable, immortal emanatio n from the Diety, to return to God and be forever happy, in His good time; as our mortal bodies, dissolving, return to the elem ents from which they came, their particles coining and going ever in perpetual genesis. To our Jewish Brethren, this supper is symbolical of the Passove r: to the Christian Mason, of that eaten by Christ and His Disciples, when, celebrating the Passover, He broke bread and gave it to them, saying, \"Take! eat! this is My body:\" and giving them the cup, He said, \"Drink ye all of it! for this is My blood of the New Test ament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins;\" thus symbolizing the perfec t harmony and union between Himself and the faithful; and His de ath upon the cross for t he salvation of man. The history of Masonry is the hist ory of Philosophy. Masons do not pretend to set themselves up for in structors of the human race: but, though Asia produced and preserved t he Mysteries, Maso nry has, in Europe and America, given regularity to their doctri nes, spirit, and action, and developed the moral adv antages which mankind ma y reap from them. More consistent, and more simple in its mode of procedure, it has put an end to the vast allegorical pantheon of ancient my thologies, and itself become a science. None can deny that Christ taught a lofty mora lity. \"Love on e another:"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"forgive those that despitefully use you and persecute yo u: be pure of heart, meek, humble, cont ented: lay not up rich es on earth, but in Heaven: submit to the powe rs lawfully over you: bec ome like these little children, or ye cannot be saved, for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven: forgive the repentant; and cast no sto ne at the sinner, if you too have sinned: do unto others as ye would have others do unto you:\" such, and not abstruse questions of theology, were His simple and sublime teachings. The early Christians follow ed in His footsteps. The first preachers of the faith had no thought of domination. Entirely animated by His saying, that he among them should be first, who should serv e with the greatest devotion, they were humbl e, modest, and c haritable, and th ey knew how to communicate this spirit of the inner man to th e churches under their direction. These churches were at fi rst but spontaneous meetings of all Christians inhabiting th e same locality. A pure and severe morality, mingled with religious ent husiasm, was the characte ristic of each, and excited the admiration even of t heir persecutors. Everything was in common among them; their property , their joys, and th eir sorrows. In the silence of night they met for instruction and to pray together. Their love-feasts, or fraternal repasts, ended these r eunions, in which all differences in social posi tion and rank were efface d in the presence of a paternal Divinity. Their so le object was to make me n better, by bringing them back to a simple worship, of whic h universal morality was the basis; and to end those numerous and cruel sacrifices which everywhere inundated with bl ood the altars of t he gods. Thus did Ch ristianity reform the world, and obey the te achings of its founder. It gave to woman her proper rank and influence; it regulated domestic life ; and by admitting the slaves to the love-feasts, it by degrees raised them above that oppression under which half of mankind had gro aned for ages. This, in its purity, as taught by Ch rist Himself, was the true primitive religion, as communicated by God to the Patriarchs. It was no new religion, but the reproduction of the oldest of all; an d its true and perfect morality is the morality of Masonry, as is the mora lity of every creed of antiquity. In the early days of Christ ianity, there was an initia tion like those of the pagans. Persons were admitte d on special conditions only. To arrive at a complete knowledge of t he doctrine, they had to pass three degrees of instruction. The initiates were conse quently divided into th ree classes; the first, Auditors, the seco nd, Catechumens, a nd the third, the Faithful. The Auditors were a sort of novices, who were prepared by certain ceremonies and cert ain instruction to receive the dogmas of Christianity. A portion of these dogmas was made known to the Catechumens; who, after particular purifications, received baptism, or the in itiation of the theogenesis (divine gener ation); but in the grand mysteries of that religion, the incarnation, nativity, passion, and resurrection of Christ, none were initiated but the Fait hful. These doctrines, and the celebration of the Holy Sacraments, particula rly the Eucharist, were kept with profound secrecy. These Mysteries we re divided into two parts; the first styled the Mass of the Catechumens; the second, the Mass of the Faithful. The celebration of the Myster ies of Mithras wa s also styled a mass; and the"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"ceremonies used were th e same. There were found all the sacraments of the Catholic Church, even the breath of confirmation. The Priest of Mithras promised the Initiates deliverance from sin, by means of confession and baptism, and a future life of happiness or misery. He celebrated the oblat ion of bread, image of the re surrection. The baptism of newly-born children, extr eme unction, confession of sins, - all belonged to the Mithriac rites. T he candidate was purified by a species of baptism, a mark was impressed upon his forehea d, he offered bread and water, pronouncing certain m ysterious words. During the persecutions in the early ages of Christianity, the Christians took refuge in the vast catacombs which stretched for miles in every direction under the city of Rome, an d are supposed to have been of Etruscan origin. There, amid labyrinthi ne windings, deep ca verns, hidden chambers, chapels, and tombs, the persecuted f ugitives found refuge, and there they pe rformed the ceremonies of the Mysteries. The Basilideans, a sect of Christians that arose soon after the time of the Apostles, practised the M ysteries, with the old Egyptian legend. They symbolized Osiris by the Sun, Isis by the Moon, and Typho n by Scorpio; and wore crystals bearing these emblems, as amulets or talismans to protect them from danger; upon which were also a br illiant star and the serpent. They were copied from the talismans of Persia and Ar abia, and given to every candidate, at his initiation. Irenæaus tells us that the Simonians, one of t he earliest sects of the Gnostics, had a Priesthood of the Mysteries. Tertullian tells us that the Valentinians, the mo st celebrated of all the Gnostic schools, imitated, or rather perverted, t he Mysteries of Eleusis. Irenæaus informs us, in several cu rious chapters, of the Mysteries practised by the Marcosi ans; and Origen gives, much information as to the Mysteries of the Ophi tes; and there is no doub t that all the Gnostic sects had Mysteries and an initiation. They al l claimed to possess a secret doctrine, coming to them directly from Jesu s Christ, different from that of the Gospel s and Epistles, and superior to those communications, which in their eyes, were merely exoteric. This secr et doctrine they did not communicate to every one; and among the exte nsive sect of the Basilideans hardly one in a thousand knew it, as we learn from Irenæaus. We know the name of only the highest class of their Initiates. They were ], and Strangers to the World [ styled Elec t or Elus [ ]. They had at lest three Degrees - the Material, the Intellectual, and the Spiritual and the lesser and greater Mysteries; and the number of thos e who attained the highest Degree was quite small. Baptism was one of thei r most important cerem onies; and th e Basilideans celebrated the 10th of January, as the anniversary of the day on which Christ was baptized in Jordan. They had the ceremony of laying on of ha nds, by way of purifi cation; and that of the mystic banquet, emblem of that to which they beli eved the Heavenly Wisdom would"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"]. one day admit them, in the fullness of things [ Their ceremonies were much more like those of the Christians than those of Greece; but they mingled with them much that was borrowed fr om the Orient and Egypt: and taught the primitive tr uths, mixed with a multitude of fantastic errors and fictions. The discipline of the secret was the concealment (occult atio) of certain tenets and ceremonies. So says Cl emens of Alexandria. To avoid persecution, the ear ly Christians were compelle d to use great precaution, and to hold meetings of the Faithful [of the Household of Faith] in private places, under concealment by darkness, They assemb led in the night, and they guarded against the intrusion of fals e brethren and profane person s, spies who might cause their arrest. They conversed together figuratively, and by the use of symbols, lest cowans and eavesdroppers might overhear: and there existed among them a favored class, or Order, who were initiated into certain Myst eries which they were bound by solemn promise not to disclose, or even converse a bout, except with such as had received them unde r the same sa nction. They were called Brethren, the Faithful, Stewards of the Mysterie s, Superintendents, Devotees of the Secret, and ARCHITECTS. In the Hierarchiœ, attributed to St. Dionysius the Areopagite, the first Bishop of Athens, the tradition of the sa crament is said to have been divided into three Degrees, or grades, pu rification, initiation, and accomplishment or perfection; and it mentions also, as part of the ce remony, the bringing to sight. The Apostolic Constitutions, attributed to Clemens, Bi shop of Rome, describe the early church, and say: \"These regulations must on no account be communicated to all sorts of persons, because of the Mysteries contained in them.\" They speak of the Deacon's duty to keep the doors, that non e uninitiated should en ter at the oblation. Ostiarii, or doorkeepers, kept guard, and gave no tice of the time of prayer and churchassemblies; and also by private signal, in times of persecuti on, gave notice to those with in, toe able them to avoid danger. The Mysteries were open to the Fideles or Faithful only; and no spectators were allowed at the communion. Tertullian, who di ed about A. D. 21 6, says in his Apology: \"None are admitted to the religious Mysteries wit hout an oath of secr ecy. We appeal to your Thracian and Eleusinian Mysteries; and we are especially bound to th is caution, because if we prove faithless, we shou ld not only provoke Heaven, but draw upon our heads the utmost rigor of human displeasure. And should str angers betray us? They know nothing but by report and hearsay. Far hence, ye Pr ofane! is the prohibition from all holy Mysteries.\" Clemens, Bishop of Al exandria, born ab out A.D. 191, says, in his Stromata, that he cannot explain the Mysterie s, because he should thereb y, according to the old proverb, put a sword into the hands of a chil d. He frequently compares the Discipline of the Secret with the heathen Mysteries, as to their internal and recondite wisdom. Whenever the early Christians happened to be in company with strangers, more properly termed the Pr ofane, they never spoke of t heir sacraments, but indicated to one another what they meant by means of sym bols and secret watchwords,"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"disguisedly, and as by dire ct communication of mind with mind, an d by enigmas. Origen, born A.D. 134 or 1 35, answering Celsus, who had objected that the Christians had a conceale d doctrine said: \"Inasmuch as the essential and important doctrines and principles of Christianity are o penly taught, it is foolish to object that there are other thin gs that are recondite; for th is is common to Christian discipline with that of those philosophers in whose teaching some things were exoteric and some esoteric: and it is enough to say that it was so with some of the disciples of Pythagoras.\" The formula which the primit ive church pronounced at t he moment of celebrating its Mysteries, was this: \"D epart, ye Profane! Let the Catechumens, and those who have not been admitt ed or initiated, go forth.\" Archelaus, Bishop of Cascara in Mesopotamia, wh o, in the year 278, conducted a controversy with the Mani chaeans, said: \"These Myst eries the church now communicates to him who has passed through the introduc tory Degree. They are not explained to the Gentiles at all; nor are they taught openly in the hearing of Catechumens: but much that is spok en is in disguised terms that the Faithful [ ], who possess the knowledge, may be still mo re informed, and those who are not acquainted with it, may su ffer no disadvantage.\" Cyril, Bishop of Jeru salem, was born in the year 315, and died in 386. In his Catechesis he says: \"The Lord spake in parabl es to His hearers in general; but to His disci ples He explained in pr ivate the parables and allegories which He spoke in public. The splendor of glor y is for those who are early enlightened: obscurity and darkness are the portion of the unbelievers and ignorant. Ju st so the church discove rs its Mysteries to those who have advanced beyond the cl ass of Catechumens: we employ obscure terms with others.\" St. Basil, the Great Bishop of Cæsarea, born in t he year 326, and dying in the year 376, says: \"We receive the dogm as transmitted to us by writing, and those which have desc ended to us from the Apostles, beneath the mystery of oral traditio n: for several things have been handed to us without writing, le st the vulgar, too familiar wi th our dogmas, should lose a due respect for them. . . . Th is is what the uninitiat ed are not permitted to contemplate; and how shoul d it ever be proper to write and circulate among the peopl e an account of them?\" St. Gregory Nazianz en, Bishop of Constantinople , A.D. 379, says: \"You have heard as much of t he Mystery as we are allo wed to speak openly in the ears of all; the rest will be communicated to y ou in private; and that you must retain within yourself. .... Our Mysteries ar e not to be made known to strangers.\" St. Ambrose, Archbi shop of Milan, who was born in 340, and died in 393, says in his work De Myster iis: \"All the Mystery shou ld be kept concealed, guarded by faithful silenc e, lest it should be inc onsiderately divulged to the ears of the Prof ane . . . . . It is not given to all to contemplate the depths of our Myster ies .... that they may not be seen by those who ought not to behold them; nor re ceived by those who cann ot preserve them.\" And in another work: \"He sins against God, who divu lges to the unworthy the Mysteries confided to hi m. The danger is not merely in violating truth, but in telling truth, if he allow himself to give hints of them to those from whom they ought to be concealed Beware of castin g pearls before swine! .... Every Mystery ought to be kept secret; and, as it were, to be covered"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"over by silence, le st it should rashly be divulged to the ears of the Profane. Take heed that you do not incautiously reveal the Mysteries!\" St. Augustine, Bishop of Hi ppo, who was born in 347, and died in 430, says in one of his discourses: \"Having dismissed the Ca techumens, we have retained you only to be our hearers; because, besi des those things which belong to all Ch ristians in common, we are now to disco urse to you of sublime Mysteries, which none are qualifi ed to hear, but thos e who, by the Master's favor, are made partakers of them....To have taught them openly, would have been to betray them.\" And he refers to the Ark of the Covenant, and says that it signified a M ystery, or secret of God, shadowed over by the cherubim of glory, and honored by being veiled. St. Chrysostom and St . Augustine speak of initiation more than fifty times. St. Ambrose writes to those who are initiated; and in itiation was not merely baptism, or admission into t he church, but it referred to initiation into the Mysteries. To the baptiz ed and initiated the Mysteries of religion were unveiled; they were kept secret from the Catechumens; who were permitted to hear the Scriptures read and the ordi nary discourses delivered, in which the Mysteries, reserved fo r the Faithful, we re never treated of. When the services and prayers were ended, t he Catechumens and spectators all withdrew. Chrysostom, Bishop of Cons tantinople, was born in 354 , and died in 417. He says: \"I wish to speak openl y: but I dare not, on acco unt of those who are not initiated. I shall therefore avail myself of disguised terms, discoursing in a shadowy manner ..... Where the holy Mysteries are celebrated, we drive away all uninitiated pers ons, and then close the doors.\" He mentions the acclamations of the initiated; \"which,\" he says, \"I here pass over in silence; for it is forbidden to disclos e such things to the Profane. \" Palladius, in his life of Chrysostom, records, as a great outrage, that, a tumu lt having been excited against him by his enemies, they forced their way into the penetralia, where the uninitiated beheld what was not proper for them to see; and Chrysostom mentions the sa me circumstance in his epist le to Pope Innocent. St. Cyril of Alexandria, w ho was made Bishop in 412, and died in 444, says in his 7th Book against Julian: \"These Myst eries are so profou nd and so exalted, that they can be comprehended by thos e only who are enlig htened. I shall not, therefore, attempt to speak of what is so admir able in them, lest by discovering them to the uninitiated, I should of fend against the injunction not to give what is holy to the impure, nor cast pearls before such as cannot estimate their worth..... I should say much more, if I were not afraid of being heard by those who are uninitiated: because men ar e apt to deride what they do not understand. A nd the ignorant, not being aware of the weakness of their minds, condemn what they ought most to venerate.\" Theodoret, Bishop of Cyro polis in Syria, was bo rn in 393, and made Bishop in 420. In one of his three Dialogues, ca lled the Immutable, he introduces Orthodoxus, speaking thus: \"A nswer me, if yo u please, in mystical or obscure terms: for perhaps there are some persons present who are not initiated into the Mysteries.\" A nd in his preface to Ezekiel, tracing up the secret disci pline to the commencement of the Christian era,"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"he says: \"These Mysteries ar e so august, that we ou ght to keep them with the greatest caution.\" Minucius Felix, an eminent lawyer of Rome, who lived in 212, and wrote a defence of Christianity, sa ys: \"Many of them [the Christians] know each other by tokens and signs (notis et insignibus), and they form a friendship for each other, almost before they become acquainted.\" The Latin Word, tessera, or iginally meant a square piece of wood or stone, used in making tesselated pavements; afterw ard a tablet on which anything was written, and then a cube or die. It s most general use was to designate a piece of meta l or wood, square in sh ape, on which the watchword of an Army was inscribed; whence tessera came to mean the watchword itself. There wa s also a tessera hospital is, which was a piece of wood cut into two parts, as a pledge of friendship. Each party kept one of the parts; and they swor e mutual fidelit y by Jupiter. To break the tessera was consi dered a dissolution of the friendship. The early Christians used it as a Mark, the watc hword of friendship. With them it was generally in the shape of a fish, and made of b one. On its face was inscribed the word , a fish , the initials of whic h represented the Greek words, ; Jesus Christ, the So n of God, t he Saviour. St. Augustine (de Fide et Svmbolis) says: \"This is the faith which in a few words is given to the Novices to be kept by a symbol; th ese few words are known to all the Faithful ; that by believing they may be submissive to God; by being thus submissive, they may live rightly; by living rightly, they may purify their hearts and with a pure heart may understand what they believe.\" Maximus Taurinus says: \"The tessera is a symbol and si gn by which to distinguish between the Faithful and the Profane.\" There are three Degrees in Blue Masonry; and in addition to the two words of two syllables each, embodying the binary, three, of three sy llables each. There were three Grand Masters, the two Kings, and Khir-Om the Artifice r. The candidate gains admission by three raps, and three raps call up the Br ethren. There are three principal officers of the Lodg e, three lights at the Altar, three gates -of the Temple, all in the East, West, and So uth. The three lights repres ent the Sun, the Moon, and Mercury; Osiris, Isis, and Horus; the Fat her, the Mother , and the Child; Wisdom, Strength, and Beaut y; Hakamah, Binah, and Daath; Gedul ah, Geburah, nd Tepareth. The candidat e makes three circuits of th e Lodge: there were three assassins of Khir-Om, and he was slain by three blows while seeking to escape by the three gates of the Temple. The ejacul ation at his grave was repeated three times. There are three* divi sions of the Temple, and th ree, five, an d seven Steps. A Master works with Chalk, C harcoal, and a vessel of Clay ; there are -.hree movable and three immovable jewels. The Triangle appear s among the Symb ols: the two parallel lines enclosing the ci rcle are connected at top, as are the Columns Jachin and Boaz, symbolizing th e equilibrium which explains the great Mysteries of Nature. This continual reproduction of the number three is not accidental, nor without a profound meaning: and we shall find the same re peated in all the Ancient philosophies. The Egyptian Gods formed Tria ds, the third member in eac h proceeding from the"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"other two. Thus we have th e Triad of Thebes, Amun, M aut, and Kharso ; that of Philae, Osiris, Isis, and Horu s; that of Elephant inë and the Cataract s, Neph, Sate, and Anoukë. Osiris, Isis, and Horus were the Father, Mother , and Son; the latter being Light, the Soul of the World, t he Son, the Protogonos or First-Begotten. Sometimes this Triad was regarded as SPIRIT, or the active Principle or Generative Power; MATTER, or the PA SSIVE Principle or Productive Capac ity; and the Universe, which proceeds fr om the two Principles. We also find in Egypt this Tr iad or Trinity; Ammon-Ra, t he Creator: Osir is-Ra. the Giver of Fruitfulness: Horus-Ra the Queller of Light; symboliz ed by the Summer, Autumn, and Spring Sun. For the Egyptians had but thre e Seasons, the three gates of the Temple ; and on account of the different effects of the Sun on those three Seasons, the Deity appears in these three forms. The Phoenician Trinity wa s Ulomos, Chusoros, and th e Egg out of which the Universe proceeded. The Chaldean Triad consisted of Be l, [the Persian Ze rvana Akherana], Oromasdes, and Ahriman; the Good and Evil Principle al ike outflowing from th e Father, by their equilibrium and alter nating preponderance to produce harmony. Each was to rule, in turn, for equal periods, until finally the Evil Principle should it self become good. The Chaldean and Persian oracle s of Zoroaster give us th e Triad, Fire, Light, and Ether. Orpheus celebrates the Tri ad of Phanes, Ouranos, a nd Kronos. Corry says the Orphic Trinity consisted of Metis, Phanes, and Ericapaeus; Will, Light or Love, and Life. Acusilaus makes it consist of Metis, Er os, and Æther: Will , Love, and Ether. Phereycides of Syros, of Fire , Water, and Air or Spirit. In the two forme r we readily recognize Osiris and Isis , the Sun and the Nile. The first three of the Pers ian Amshaspands were BAHMAN , the Lord of LIGHT; Ardibehest, the Lord Of FI RE; and Shariver, the Lord of SPLENDOR. These at once lead us back to the Kabala. Plutarch says: \"The better and di viner nature consists of three; the Intelligible (i.e. that and which exists within the Intellect only as yet), and Ma tter; , and that which proceeds from these, which the Gree ks call Kosmos: of wh ich Plato calls the Intelligible, the Idea, the Ex emplar, the Father: Matter, the Mother, the Nurse, and the receptacle and place of gener ation: and the iss ue of these two, t he Offspring and Genesis.\" The Pythagorean fragments sa y: \"Therefore, before the Heaven was made, there existed Idea and Matter, and God the Demiourgos [workman or active instrument], of the former. He made the world out of matter, perfe ct, only-begotten, with a soul and"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"intellect, and constitu ted it a divinity.\" Plato gives us Thought, the Father; Primitive Matter, th e Mother; and Kosmos, the Son, the issue of the tw o Principles. Kosmos is the ensouled Universe. With the later Platonists, the Triad was Potence, In tellect, and Spirit, Philo represents Sanchoniathon's as Fire, Light, and Flame, the three Sons of Genos; but this is the Alexandrian, not the Phœnician idea. Aurelius says the Demiourgos or Creator is triple, and the three Intellects are the three Kings: He who exists; He who possesses; He who beholds. The first is that which exists by its esse nce; the second exis ts in the first, and contains or possesses in itself the Universal of things; all that afterward becomes: the third behol ds this Universal, formed and fashioned intellectually, and so having a separate existence. The Third exists in the Second, and th e Second in the First. The most ancient Trinitar ian doctrine on record is that of the Brahmins. The Eternal Supreme Essence, called PARABRAHMA, BRAHM, PARATMA, produced the Universe by self -reflection, and first revealed himself as BRAHMA, th e Creating Power, then as VISHNU, the Preserving Power, and lastly as SIVA, the De stroying and Renovating Power; the three Modes in which the Supreme Essenc e reveals himself in the material Universe; but which soon to be regarded as three distinct Deities. These three Deit ies came they st yled the TRIMURTI, or TRIAD. The Persians received from the In dians the doctrine of the three principles, and changed it to that of a principl e of Life, which was individualized by the Sun, and a prin ciple of Death, wh ich was symbolized by cold and darkness; pa rallel of the moral worl d; and in which the continual and alternating struggle between light and darkne ss, life and death, seemed but a phas e of the great struggle between the good and evil principles, embodied in the legend of ORMUZD and AHRIMAN. MITHRAS, a Median refo rmer, was deified after hi s death, and invested with the attributes of th e Sun; the different astr onomical phenom ena being figuratively detailed as act ual incidents of his life; in the same manner as the history of BUDDHA was invented among the Hindüs. The Trinity of the Hindüs became among the Ethi opians and Abyssinians NEPH-AMON, PHTHA, and NEITH - the God CREA TOR, whose emblem was a ram - MATTER, or t he primitive mud, symboliz ed by a globe or an egg, and THOUGHT, or the LIGHT which contains t he germ of everything; triple manifestation of one and the same God (ATH OM), considered in three aspects, as the creative powe r, goodness, and wisdom. Other Deities were speedily invented; and among them OSTRIS, represented by the Sun, ISIS, his wife, by the Moon or Earth, TYPHON, his Brother, the Principle of Evil and Da rkness, who was the son of Osiris and Isis. And the Trinity of OSIRIS, ISIS, and HORUS became s ubsequently the Chief Gods and objects of wors hip of the Egyptians. The ancient Etruscans (a race that em igrated from the Rhætian Alps into Italy, along whose route evidence s of their migrat ion have been discovered, and whose language none have yet su cceeded in reading) acknowledged only one S upreme God; but they had images for His different attributes, and temples to these image s. Each town had one"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"National Temple, dedicated to the three great attributes of God, STRENGTH, RICHES, and WISDOM, or Tina, Taln a, and Minerva. The National Deity was always a Triad under one roof; a nd it was the same in Egypt, where one Supr eme God alone was ack nowledged, but was worshipped as a Triad, wi th different names in eac h different home. Each city in Etruria might ha ve as many gods and gates and temples as it pleased; but three sacred gates, and one Temple to three Divine Attributes were obligatory, wherever the laws of Ta ges (or Taunt or Thoth) were received. The only gate that re mains in Italy, of the olden time, undestroyed, is the Porta de l Circo at Volterra; and it has upon it the three heads of the three Nati onal Divinities, one u pon the keystone of its magnificent arch, and one above each side-pillar. The Buddhists hold that t he God SAKYA of the Hindü s, called in Ceylon, GAUTAMA, in India bey ond the Ganges, SOMO NAKODOM, and in China, CHY-KIA, or Fo, constituted a Trinity [TRIRATN A], of BUDDHA, DHARMA, and SANGA, - Intelligence, Law, and Union or Harmony. The Chinese Sabæans represented the Supreme Deity as composed of CHANG-TI, the Supreme Sovereign; TIEN, the Heavens ; and TAO, the Universal Supreme Reason and Principle of Faith; and that from Chaos, an immense silence, an im measurable void. without perceptible forms, alone, infinite, immu table, moving in a circle in illimitable sp ace, without change or alteration, when vivified by the Principle of Truth, issued all Beings, under the influence of TAO, Principle of Fa ith, who produced one, one produced two, two produced three, and three produced all that is. The Sclavono-Vendes typified the Trin ity by the three he ads of the God TRIGLAV; and the Pruczi or Prussian s by the Tri-une Go d, PERKOUN, PIKOLLOS, and POTRIMPOS, the Deities of Light and Thunder, of Hell and the Earth, it s fruits and anim als: and the Scandinavians by ODIN , FREA, and THOR. In the KABALAH, or the Hebrew traditiona l philosophy, the In finite Deity, beyond the reach of the Human Intell ect, and without Name, Form, or Limitation, was repr esented as developi ng Himself, in order to create, and by self-limitation, in ten emanations or out-flowings, call ed SEPHIROTH, or rays, The first of these, in the world AZILUTH, that is, within the Deity, was KETHER, or the Crown, by which we understand the Divine Will or Potency. Next came, as a pair, HAI\",MAH and BAINAH, ordinarily translated \"Wisdom\" and \"Intelligence,\" the former termed the FATHER, and the latter the MOTHER. HAKEMAH is the active Power or Energy of Deity, by which He produces within Hi mself Intellection or Thinking: and BAINAH, the passive Capacit y, from which, acted on by the Power, the Intellection flows. This Intellection is called DAATH: and it is the \"WORD,\" of Plato and the Gnostics; the unuttered word, within the Deity. Here is the origin of the Trinity of the Father , the Mother or Holy Spirit, and the Son or Word. Another Trinity was comp osed of the fourth Se phirah, GEDULAH or KHASW, Benignity or Me rcy, also termed FATHER (Aba); the fifth, GEBURAH, Severity or St rict Justice, also term ed the MOTHER (Imma); and the sixth, the SON or Issue of these, TI PHARETH, Beauty or Harmony. \"Everything,\" says the SOHA R, “proceeds according to the Mystery of the Balance\" - that is, by the equilibr ium of Opposi tes: and"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"thus from the Infinite Mercy and the Infi nite justice, in e quilibrium, flows the perfect Harmony of th e Universe.

According to Philo of Al exandria, the Supreme Bei ng, Primitive Light or Archetype of Light, uniting with WISD OM [ ], the mother of Creation, forms in Himself the types of all thi ngs, and acts upon the Universe through the WORD [ . . Logos], who dw ells in God, and in whom all His powers and attributes develop them selves; a doctrine borrowed by him from Plato. Simon Magus and his discipl es taught that the Suprem e Being or Centre of Light produced first of all, three couples of united Existences, of both sexes, [ ... Suzugias], which were the origins of all things: REASON and INVENTIVEN ESS; SPEECH and THOUGHT; and and , CALCULATION and REFLECTION: [ and , ... Nöus and Epinoi a, Phöne and Ennoia, Logismos and Enthumësis]; of which Enno ia or WISDOM was the fi rst produced, and Mother of all that exists. Other Disciples of Simon, and with them most of th e Gnostics, adopting and ... Pleröma, or PLENITUDE of modify ing the doctrine, taught that the Superior Intelligences, having the Supreme Being at their head, was composed of eight Eons [ . . Aiönes] of different se xes; . .

Bardesanes, whose doctrines the Syrian Christians long em braced, taught that the unknown Father, ha ppy in the Plenitude of Hi s Life and Perfections, first produced a Co mpanion for Himself [ ... Su zugos], whom He placed in the Celestial Paradise and who became, by Him, th e Mother of CHRISTOS, Son of the Living God: i. e. (laying aside the allego ry), that the Eternal conceived, in the silence of His decrees , the Thought of reve aling Himself by a Being who should be His image or His Son: that to the Son su cceeded his Sister and Spouse, the Holy Spirit, and they produced four Spirits of the elements, male and female, Maio and Ja bseho, Nouro and Rucho; then Seven Mystic Couples of Spirits, and Heaven and Earth, an d all that is; then seven spirits governing the planets, twelve governing th e Constellations of the Zodiac, and thirty-six Star ry Intelligences whom he ca lled Deacons: while the Holy Spirit [Sophia Achamoth ], being both the Holy In telligence and the Soul of the physical world, went from the Pler öma into that materi al world and there mourned her degradatio n, until CHRISTOS, her former spouse, coming to her with his Divine Light and Love , guided her in the way to purification, and she again united herself with him as his primitive Companion. Basilides, the Christ ian Gnostic, taught that there were seven emanations from the Supreme Being: The First-born, Thought, the Word, Reflection, , , , , , Wisdom, Powe r, and Righteousness [ , and Protogonos, Nous, L ogos, Phronesis, Soph ia, Dunamis, and"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"Dikarosunë]; from whom em anated other Intelligences in succession, to the number, in all, of three hundred and sixt y-five; which were God manifested, and composed the Plenitude of t he Divine Emanations , or the God Abraxas; of which the Thought [or In tellect, . .

Basilides held that out of t he unrevealed God, w ho is at the head, of the world of emanations, and exalt ed above all concepti on or designation [ ], were evolved seven living, self-subsistent, ever-active hyposatized powers: 1st.

In the system of Basilide s, Light, Life, So ul, and Good were opposed to Darkness, Death, Matter, and Evil, throughou t the whole course of the Universe. According to the Gnosti c view, God was represent ed as the immanent, incomprehensible and origin al source of all perfecti on; the unfathomable ABYSS ( . . buthos), according to Valentinus , exalted above all possibility of designation; of whom , properly speaking, nothin g can be predicated; the of Basilides, the of Ph ilo.

From this primal link in the chain of life there are evolved, in the first plac e, the manifold powers or attributes inherent in the divine Essence, whic h, until that first selfcomprehension, were all hidden in the Abyss of His Essence. Ea ch of these attributes presents the w hole divine Essence under one particula r aspect; and to each, therefore, in this re spect, the title of God may appropriately be applied. These Divine Powers evolving themselv es to self-subsistence, become thereupon the germs and principl es of all further developm ents of life. The life contained in them unfolds an d individualizes itself more and more, but in such a way that the successiv e grades of this evol ution of life continually sink lower and lower; the spirits become fe ebler, the further th ey are removed from the first link in the series. The first manifestat ion they termed heautou] or was hypostatically represented in a or [protë katalëpsis [proton katalëpton tou Theou]; which [Nous or Logos]. In the Alexandrian Gnosis, the Platonic notion of th e [Hulë] predominates. This is the dead, the unsubstantial - the boundary that limits from without the evolution of life in its gradually advancing pr ogression, whereby the Perfect is ever evolving itself into the less Perfect. This again, is represented under various images; - at one time as the darkness that exists alongside of the light; at another, as the void [ , .... Kenoma, Kenon], in oppos ition to the Fullness, [ .... Plëroma] of the Divine Life; or as th e shadow that accompanies the light; or as the chaos, or the sluggish, st agnant, dark water. This ma tter, dead in itself, possesses by its own nature no inherent tendency; as li fe of every sort is foreign to it, itself makes no encroa chment on the Divine. As, however, the evolutions of the Divi ne Life (the essences dev eloping themselves out of the progressive emanation) becom e feebler, the furt her they are removed from the first link in the series; and as thei r connection with the first becomes looser at each successive step, there arises at the last step of the evolution, an imperfect, defective product, which, una ble to retain its connection with the c hain of Divine Life, sinks from the Worl d of Eons into the material chaos: or, accordin g to the same notion, somewhat differently expressed [according to t he Ophites and to Bardesanes], a drop from the fullness of the Divine life bubbles over into the bordering void. Hereupon the dead matter, by commixture with the living pr inciple, which it wanted, first of al l receives animation. But, at the same time, also, the divine, the living, becomes corrupted by mingl ing with the chaotic mass. Existence now multiplies itse lf. There arises a subordinate, defective life; there is gr ound for a new world; a creation starts into being, beyond the confines of t he world of emanati on. But, on the other hand, since the chaotic principle of matter has acquired vita lity, there now arises a more distinct and more active opp osition to the God-like - a barely negative, blind, ungodly na ture-power, which obst inately resists all influence of the Divine; he nce, as products of the spirit of the (of the"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":".. Pneuma Hulikon) , are Satan, malignant spirits, wicked men, in none of whom is ther e any reasonable or mora l principle, or any principle of a rational w ill; but blind passi ons alone have th e ascendency. In them there is the sa me conflict, as the schem e of Platonism supposes, between the soul under th e guidance of Divine reas on [the . . Nous], and the soul blindly re sisting reason - between the [pronoia] and the [anagë], the Divine Pr inciple and th e natural. The Syrian Gnosis assumed the existe nce of an active, turbulent kingdom of evil, or of darkness, which, by its encroach ments on the ki ngdom of light, brought about a commixtu re of the ligh t with the darkn ess, of the God-like with the ungodlike. Even among the Platonists, some thought that along with an organized, inert ma tter, the substratum of t he corporeal world, there existed from the beginning a blind, lawless motive power, an ungodlike soul, as its original moti ve and active principle. As the inorganic matter was organized into a corporeal world, by the plas tic power of the Deity, so, by the same power, law and reason were co mmunicated to that turbulent, irrational soul . Thus the chaos of the was transformed into an organized world, and t hat blind soul into a ra tional principle, a mundane soul, animating the Universe. As from the latt er proceeds all rational, spiritual life in humanity, so from the forme r proceeds all that is irrational, all that is und er the blind sway of passi on and appetit e; and all malignant spirits are its progeny. In one respect all the G nostics agreed: they all held, that there was a world purely emanating out of the vi tal development of God, a creation evolved directly out of t he Divine Essence, far ex alted above any outward creation produced by God's plastic powe r, and conditioned by pre-existing matter. They agreed in holdi ng that the framer of th is lower world was not the Father of that hig her world of emanation; but the Demi urge [ - ], a being of a kindred nature with the Universe framed and governed by him, and far inferior to that higher system and the Father of it. But some, setting out from ideas which had long prevaile d among certain Jews of Alexandria, s upposed that the Supr eme God created and governed the worl d by His ministering spirits, by the angels. At the head of these angels stood one who had the dire ction and control of all; therefore called the Artifi cer and Governor of the World. This Demiurge they compared with the plastic, animating, mundane spirit of Plato and ....Deuteros Theos; the Pl atonists [the .... Theos Genetos], who, moreover, according to the Timæus of Plato, strives to represent the IDEA of th e Divine Reason, in that which is becoming (as contradistinguished from that which is) and temporal. This angel is a representative of the Su preme God, on the lower stage of existence: he does not act independently, bu t merely according to the ideas inspired in him by the Supreme God; just as t he plastic, mundane soul of the Platonists creates all things after t he pattern of the i deas communicated ....

As an organ un der the guidance of a high er inspiration, he reveals higher truths than he himsel f can comprehend. The mass of the Jews, they held, recognized not th e angel, by whom, in all the Theophanies of the Old Te stament, God rev ealed Himself ; they knew not the Demiurge in his true re lation to the hidden Su preme God, who never reveals Himself in the se nsible world. They conf ounded the type and the archetype, the symbol an d the idea. They rose no higher than the Demiurge; they took him to be the Supreme God Himself. But the spiritual men among them, on the co ntrary, clearly perceived, or at least divined, the ideas veiled under Judaism; they ro se beyond the Demiurge, to a knowledge of the Supr eme God; and are ther efore properly His . . Therapeutai]. worshippers [ Other Gnostics, who had not been followers of the Mosaic religion, but who had, at an earlier per iod, framed to themselves an oriental Gnosis, regarded the Demiurge as a being absolutely hostile to the Supreme God. He and his angels, notwithstanding t heir finite nature, wi sh to establish their independence: they will tolerate no foreign rule within thei r realm. Whatever of a higher na ture descends into their kingdom, they seek to hold imprisoned there, lest it should raise itself above their narrow precincts. Probably, in this system, the kingdom of the Demiurgic Angels corresponded, for the most part, with that of the de ceitful Star-Spirits, who seek to rob man of his freedom, to beguile him by various arts of deception, and who exercise a tyrannical sway over the things of this world. Accordingly, in the system of these Sabæ ans, the seven Planet- Spirits, and the twelve St ar-Spirits of the zodiac , who sprang from an irregular connection betw een the cheated Fetahil and the Spirit of Darkness, play an importan t part in everythi ng that is bad. The Demiurge is a limited and limiting bei ng, proud, jealous , and revengeful; and this his character betrays itself in the Old Testament, whic h, the Gnostics held, came from him. They transferred to t he Demiurge himself, whatever in the idea of God, as pres ented by the Old Testam ent, appeared to them defective. Against his wi ll and rule the was continually rebelling, revolting without control against the dominion whic h he, the fashioner, would exercise over it, casting off the yoke imposed on it, and destroying the work he had begun. The same jealous being, li mited in his power, ruli ng with despotic sway, they imagined they saw in nature. He strives to check t he germination of the divine seeds of life which th e Supreme God of Holiness and Love, who has no connection what ever with the sensible world, has scattered among men. That perfect God was at most known and worshipped in Mysteries by a few spiritual men. The Gospel of St. John is in great measure a polemic against the Gnostics, whose different se cts, to solve the great problems, the creation of a material worl d by an immaterial Being, the fall of man, the incarnation, the r edemption and re storation of the spir its called men, admitted a long series of in telligences, intervening in a series of spiritual operations; and which they designated by the names, The Beginning, the Word, the Only-Begotten, Li fe, Light, and Spirit [Ghost]: in Greek, , , Mo- and [Archë, Logos, Monogenës, Zöe, ,"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"Phös, and Pneuma]. St. John, at the beginning of his Gospel, avers that it was Jesus Christ who existed in the B eginning; that He was the WORD of God by which everything was made; th at He was the On ly-Begotten, the Life and the Light, and that He diffu ses among men the Ho ly Spirit [or Ghost], the Divine Life and Light. So the Plëroma [ ], Plenitude or Fu llness, was a favo rite term with the Gnostics, and Truth and Grace were the Gn ostic Eons; and the Simonians, Dokëtës, and other Gnostics held that the E on Christ Jesus was never really, but only apparently cloth ed with a human body: but St. John replies that the Word did really become Fles h, and dwelt among us; and that in Him were the Pl ëroma and Truth and Grace. In the doctrine of Valentin us, reared a Christian at Alexandria, God was a perfect Being, an Abyss [ . .

The harmony of the Eons, st ruggling to know and be united to the Primitive God, was disturbed, and to redeem an d restore them, the Intelligence [ ] produced Christ and the Ho ly Spirit His companion; who rest ored them to their first estate of happ iness and harmony; and thereup on they formed the Eon Jesus, born of a Virgin, to whom the Christos united himself in baptism and w ho, with his Companion Sophia-Achamoth, sav ed and redeemed the world. The Marcosians taught t hat the Supreme Deity pro duced by His words the [Logos] or Plenitude of Eons: His first utterance was a syllable of four letters, each of which became a being; His second of four , His third of ten, and His fourth of twelve: thirty in all, which constituted the f [Plëroma].

The essence of the [Hulikoi] (of wh om Satan is the head), is the direct opposite to all unity; disruption and disunion in it self, without the least sympathy, without any point of coalescence whatever for unity; together with an effort to destroy all unity, to ex tend its own inherent disunion to everything, and to rend everything asunde r. This principle has no power to posit anything; but only to negative: it is unable to create, to produce, to form, but only to destroy, to decompose. By Marcus, the disciple of Valent inus, the idea of a [Logos Tou Ontos], of a WORD, m anifesting the hidden Divi ne Essence, in the Creation, was spun out into the most subtle details - th e entire creation being, in his view, a continuous utterance of th e Ineffable. The way in which the germs of divine life [the .... spermata pneumatika], which lie sh ut up in the Eons, co ntinually unfold and individualize them se lves more and more, is represented as a spontaneous analysis of the several names of the Ineffable, into their several sounds. An echo of the Plërom a falls down into the [HuIë], and becomes the forming of a new but lower creation. One formula of the pneumat ical baptism among the Gnostics ran thus: \"In the NAME which is hidden from all th e Divinities and Powers\" [of the Demiurge], \"The Name of Truth\" [the [Aletheial, self-manifestation of the Buthos], which Jesus of Nazareth has put on in the light-zones of Christ, the living Christ, through the Holy Ghost, fo r the redemption of the angels, - the Name by which all things at tain to Perfection.\" The candidate then said: \"I am established and rede emed; I am redeeme d in my soul from this world, and from all t hat belongs to it, by the name of , who has redeemed the Soul of Jesus by the living Chri st.\" The assembly then said: \"Peace (or Salvation) to all on whom this name rests!\" The boy Dionusos, torn in pieces, acco rding to the Bacchic Mysteries, by the Titans, was considered by the Mani cheans as simply representing the Soul, swallowed up by the powers of dark- ness, - the divine life rent into fragments by matt er: - that part of the luminous essence of the pr imitive man [the [Protos Anthropos] of Mani, the [P raön Anthröpos] of the Valentinians, the Adam K admon of the Kaba lah; and the Kalomorts of the Zendavesta], swallowed up by the powers of darkness; the Mundane Soul, mixed with matter - the seed of divine life , which had fallen into matter, and had thence to undergo a process of purification and development."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"The [Gnosis] of Carpocrates and hi s son Epiphanes consisted in the knowledge of one Suprem e Original being, the highest unity, from whom all existence has em anated, and to w hom it strives to return.

These spirits, mo reover, seek to retain under their dominion the s ouls which, emanating from the highest Unity, and still partaking of its nature, have lapsed into the corporeal world, and have there been impris oned in bodies, in order, unde r their dominion, to be kept within the cycle of migration.

As examples of this sort, they named Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, and Christ. They made no distinction between the latter and the wise and good men of every nation. They taught that any ot her soul which coul d soar to the same height of contemplation, migh t be regarded as e qual with Him. The Ophites commenced their system with a Suprem e Being, long unknown to the Huma n race, and still so the grea ter number of men; the [Buthos], or Profundity , Source of Li ght, and of Ada m-Kadmon, the Primitive Man, made by the Demiourgos, but perf ected by the Supreme God by the communication to him of the Spirit [ . .

Together with this Primitive Existence, Matte r existed also (the Wa ters, Darkness, Abyss, and Chaos), eternal like th e Spiritual Principle. Bu thos and His Thought, uniting with Wisdom, made her fruitful by the Divine Light, and she produced a perfect and an imperfect being, Christ os, and a Second and inferior wisdom, Sophia-Achamoth, who falling into chaos remained entangled there, became enfeebled, and lost al l knowledge of the Superior Wisdom that gave her birth.

Tatian adopted the theory of Emanation, of Eons, of the existence of a God too sublime to allow Himself to be known, but displayi ng Himself by Intelligences emanating from His bosom. The first of these was His spirit [ ..... Pneuma], God Hi mself, God thinking, God conceiving the Universe. The second was the Word [ ...

This was the Trin ity, composed of the Father, Spirit, and Word. The Elxaïtes adopted the Seven Spirits of the Gn ostics; but named them Heaven, Water, Spirit, The Holy Angels of Prayer, Oil, Salt, and the Earth. The opinion of the Doketes as to the human nature of Je sus Christ, was that most generally received among the Gnostics. They deemed the intelligences of the Super ior World too pure and too much the antagonists of matter, to be willing to unite with it: and held that Christ, an Intelligence of the first rank, in ap pearing upon the ear th, did not beco me confounded with matter, but took upon Himself only the appearance of a body, or at the most used it only as an envelope. Noëtus termed the Son the first Utterance of t he Father; the Word, not by Himself, as an Intelligence, and unconn ected with the flesh, a real Son; but a Word, and a perfect Only-Begotten; light emanated fr om the Light; water flowing from it s spring; a ray emanat ed from the Sun. Paul of Samosata taught that Jesus Christ was the Son of Joseph and Mary; but that the Word, Wisdom, or Intelligence of God, the [Nous] of the Gnostics, had united itself with Him, so that He might be said to be at once the Son of God, and God Himself. Arius called the Sa viour the first of creature s, non-emanated from God, but really created, by the direct will of God, before time"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"and the ages. According to t he Church, Christ was of the same nature as God; according to some dissenters, of the same nature as man. Arius adopted the theory of a nat ure analogous to both. Wh en God resolved to create the Human race, He made a Be ing which He called THE WORD, THE SON, WISDOM [ , , .... Logos, Uios, Sophia], to the end that He might give existence to me n. This WORD is the Ormuzd of Zoroaster, the Ensoph of the Ka balah, the ; of Platonism and Philonism, and the or [So phia or Demiourgos] of the Gnostics. He distinguished the Inferior Wisdom, or the daughter, from the Superior Wisdom; th e latter being in G od, inherent in His nature, and incapable of communication to any crea ture: the second, by which the Son was made, communicated itself to Him, and ther efore He Himself was entitled to be called the Word and the Son. Manes, founder of the Se ct of the Manicheans, who had live d and been distinguished among the Persian Magi, profited by the doctrines of Scythianus, a Kabalist or Judaizing Gnostic of the times of the Apostles; and knowing those of Bard esanes and Harmonius, der ived his doctrines from Zoroasterism, Christ ianity, and Gnos ticism. He claimed to be the [Paraklêtos] or Comforter, in th e Sense of a Teacher, organ of the Deity, but not in that of the Holy Spirit or Holy Ghost: and commenced his Epistola Fundamen ti in these words: \"Manes, Apostle of Jesus Christ, elect of God the Fa ther; Behold the Words of Sa lvation, eman ating from the living and eternal foun tain.\" The dominant idea of his doctrine was Pantheism, derived by him from its sour ce in the regions of India and on the confines of China: that the cause of all that exis ts is in God; and at last, God is all in all. Al l souls are equal - God is in all, in men, animals, and plants. There are two Go ds, one of Good and the other of Evil, each independent, eternal, ch ief of a distinct Empire; necessarily, and of their very natures, hostile to one another. The Evil God, Sa tan, is the Genius of matter alone. The God of G ood is infinitely his Su perior, the True God; while the other is but the ch ief of all that is the Enemy of God, and must in the end succumb to His Po wer. The Empire of Ligh t alone is eternal and true; and this Empire is a great chain of Emanati ons, all connected with the Supreme Being which th ey make manifest; all Him, under different forms, chosen for one end, the tr iumph of the G ood. In each of His members lie hidden thousands of ineffable tr easures. Excellent in His Glory, incomprehensibl e in His Greatness, the Fa ther has joined to Himself those fortunate , and glorious Eons [ . . Aionês], whose Power and Number it is im possible to determin e. This is Spinoza's Infinity of Infinite Attributes of God. Twelve Chief Eons, at the head of all, were the Genii of the twel ve Constellations of the Zodi ac, and called by Manes, Olamin. Satan, also, Lord of the Empire of Dark ness, had an Army of Eons or Demons, emanatin g from his Essence, and reflecting more or less his image, but divi ded and inharmonious amo ng themselves. A war among them brought them to the confines of the Realm of Light. Delighted, they sought to conquer it. But the Chief of the Cele stial Empire created a Power which he pl aced on the frontiers of Heaven to protect his Eons, and destroy the Empire of Evil. This was the Mother of Life, the Soul of the World, an Emanation from the Supr eme Being, too pure to come in immediate contact with matter. It remained in the highest region;"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"but produced a Son, the first Man [the Kaiomorts, Adam-Kadmon, [Protos Anthropos,] and Hivil-Ziva h; of the Zend-Avesta, the Kabalah, the Gnosis, and Sabeism]; wh o commenced the co ntest with the Powers of Evil, but, losi ng part of his panoply, of his Light, his Son and many souls born of the Light, who were devoured by the darkness, God sent to his assistance the living Spirit, or the Son of the First Man [ . . . Uios Anthropou], or Jesus Christ. The Mo ther of Life, general Principle of Divine Life, and the first Man, Primitiv e being that reveals the Divine Life, are too sublime to be connected with th e Empire of Darkness. The Son of Man or Soul of the World, enters into the Darkness, becomes its captive, to end by tempering an d softening its sava ge nature. The Divine Spirit, after having brought back t he Primitive Man to the Empire of Light, raises above the worl d that part of the Celestia l Soul that remained unaffected by being mingle d with the Empire of Da rkness. Placed in the region of the Sun and Moon, this pure soul, th e Son of Man, the Redeemer or Christ , labors to deliver and attrac t to Himself that part of the Light or of the Soul of the First Man diffus ed through matt er; which done, the world will cease to exist. To retain the rays of Light still remaining among his Eons, and ever tending to e scape and return, by concentrating them, the Prince of Darkness, wi th their co nsent, made Adam, whose soul was of the Divine Light, contributed by the Eons, and his body of matter, so that he belonged to both Empires, t hat of Light and that of Darkness. To prev ent the light from escaping at once, the Demons forbade Adam to ea t the fruit of \"kno wledge of good and evil,\" by which he would have known the Empire of Light and that of Darkness. He obeyed; an Angel of Light induced him to tr ansgress, and gave him the means of victory; but the Demons created Eve, who seduc ed him into an act of Sensualism, that enfeeble d him, and bound him an ew in the bonds of matter. This is repeated in the case of every man that lives. To deliver the soul, captiv e in darkness, the Principle of Ligh t, or Genius of the Sun, charged to re deem the Intellectual World, of which he is the type, came to manifest Himself among men. Light appeared in the darkness, but the darkness comprehended it not; accordin g to the words of St. John. The Light coul d not unite with the darkness. It but put on the appearance of a human b ody, and took the name of Christ in the Messiah, only to accommodate itself to the langua ge of the Jews. The Light did its work, turni ng the Jews from the a doration of the Evil Principle, and the Pagans from the worship of Demo ns. But the Chief of the Empire of Darkness ca used Him to be crucified by the Jews. Still He suffered in appearan ce only, and His death gave to all souls the symbol of their enfranchisement. The person of Jesus havi ng disappeared, there was seen in His place a cross of Li ght, over which a celestial voice pronounced these words: \"T he cross of Light is ca lled The Word, Christ, The Gate, Joy, The Bre ad, The Sun, The Resurr ection, Jesus, The Father, The Spirit, Life , Truth, and Grace.\" With the Priscillia nists there were two principl es, one the Divinity, the other, Primitive Matter and Darkness; each eternal.

Such were some of the ancient notions concerning the Deity and taken in connection with what has been det ailed in the precedin g Degrees, this Lecture affords you a true picture of the ancient speculat ions. From the beginning until now, thos e who have undertaken to solve the great mystery of the crea tion of a material universe by an Immaterial Deity, have interposed between the two, and between God and man, divers manifestations of, or ema nations from, or personified attributes or agents of, the Great Supreme God, who is coexistent with Time and coextensive with Space. The universal belief of t he Orient was, that the Supreme Being did not Himself create either th e earth or man. The fr agment which commences the Book of Genesis, cons isting of the first chapt er and the three first verses of the second, a ssigns the creation or rather the formation or modelling of the world from matter already existing in confusion, not to lHUH, but to the ALHIM, well known as Subordinate Deitie s, Forces, or Manifestations, among the Phœnicians. The second fragment imputes it to IHUH-ALHIM,* and St . John assigns the creati on to the or WORD; and asserts that CHRIST wa s that WORD, as well as LIGHT and LIFE, other emanations from the Great Primeval Deity, to which other faiths had assigned the work of creation. An absolute existence, wholly immateri al, in no way within the reach of our senses; a cause, but not an effect that never was not, but existed during an infinity of eter nities, before ther e was anything else except Time and Space, is wholly beyo nd the reach of our conc eptions. The mind of man has wearied itself in speculations as to His na ture, His ess ence, His attributes; and ended in bein g no wiser than it began. In the impossibility of conceiving of immateriality, we fe el at sea and lost whenever we go beyond the domain of matter. And ye t we know that there are Power * The Substance, or Very Self, of which the Alohayim are the manifestations. Forces, Causes, that are themselves not matter. We give them names, but what they really are, and what their essenc e, we are whol ly ignorant. But, fortunately, it does no t follow that we may no t believe, or even know, that which we cannot explain to ours elves, or that wh ich is beyond the reach of our comprehension. If we believed only t hat which our intellect can grasp, measure, comp rehend, and have distinct and cl ear ideas of, we should believe scarce anything. The senses are not the witnesses that bear testimony to us of the loftiest truths. Our greatest difficulty is, that l anguage is not adequate to express our"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"ideas; because our words refer to thin gs, and are images of what is substantial and material. If we use the word “emanation,\" our mind involuntarily recurs to something materi al, flowing out of some other thing that is material; and if we reject this i dea of materiality, not hing is left of the emanation but an unr eality. The word \"t hing\" itself suggests to us that which is material and within the cognizance and jurisdiction of the senses. If we cut away from it the idea of materiality, it presents itself to us as no thing, but an intangible unreality, which the mind vain ly endeavors to grasp. Existence and Being are term s that have the same color of materiality; and when we speak of a Power or Force, the mind immediately images to itse lf one physical and materi al thing acting upon another. Eliminate that idea; and the Po wer or Force, dev oid of physical characteristics, seems as unreal as the shadow t hat dances on a wall, itself a mere absence of li ght; as spirit is to us me rely that which is not matter. Infinite space and infinite time are the two primary idea s. We formulize them thus: add body to b ody and sphere to sphere , until the imagination wearies; and still there will remain beyond, avoid, empty, unoccupied SPACE, limitless, because it is void. Add event to event in continuous succession, forever and fore ver, and there will still remain, before and after, a TIME in which there was and will be no event, and also endless because it too is void. Thus these two ideas of the boundle ssness of space an d the endlessness of time seem to involve the ideas that matter and events are limited and finite. We cannot conceive of an infinity of worlds or of events; but only of an indefinite number of ea ch; for. as we struggle to conceive of their infinity, the thought ever o ccurs in despite of all our efforts - there must be space in which there are no worlds; there must have be en time when there were no events. We cannot conceive how, if this earth moves millio ns of millions of miles a million times repeated, it is still in the centre of s pace; nor how, if we lived millions of millions of ages and centuries, we should still be in the centre of eternity - with still as mu ch space on one side as on the other; with still as much time before us as b ehind; for that seems to sa y that the world has not moved nor we li ved at all. Nor can we comprehend how an infinite series of worl ds, added together, is no larger than an infinite series of atom s; or an infinite se ries of centuries no longer than an in finite series of seconds; bo th being alike infinite, and therefore one series containing no more nor fewer units than the other. Nor have we the capacity to form in ourselves any idea of that which is immaterial. We use the wo rd, but it conveys to us on1v the idea of the absence and negati on of materiality; which va nishing, Space and Time alone, infinite and boundless, seem to us to be left. We cannot form an y conception of an ef fect without a caus e. We cannot but believe, inde ed we know, that, how far soever we may have to run back along the chain of effects and causes, it cannot be infinite ; but we must come at last to something which is not an effect, but the first cause: and vet the fact is literaltv bey ond our comprehens ion. The mind refu ses to grasp the idea of self-existence, of existence without a b eginning. As well expect the hair that grows upon our head to underst and the nature an d immortality"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"of the soul. It does not need to go so far in search of myst eries; nor have we any right to disbelieve or doub t the existence of a Great Firs t Cause, itself no effect, because we cannot comprehend it; becau se the words we us e do not even express it to us adequately. We rub a needle for a little while, on a dark, inert mass of iron or e, that had lain idle in the earth for many centuries. Something is thereby communicated to the steel - we term it a virtue, a pow er, or a quality - and then we balance it upon a pivot; and, lo! drawn by some invisible, mysterious Power, one pole of the needle turns to the Nort h, and there the same Power keeps the same pole for days and years; will keep it there, perhaps, as long as the wo rld lasts, carry the needl e where you will, and no matter what seas or mountains intervene between it and the North Pole of the world. And this Power, thus acting, and indicating to the mariner his c ourse over the trackless ocean, when the stars shine not for many days, saves vessels from shipwreck, families from distress, and those from sudden death on whose lives the fate of nations and the p eace of the world depend. But for it, Napoleon might never ha ve reached the ports of France on his return from Egypt, nor Nelson lived to fight and win at Trafalgar . Men call this Power Magnetism, and then complacently think that they have explained it all; and yet t hey have but given a new name to an unknown thing, to hide their ignorance. What is this wonderful Powe r? It is a real, actual, active Power: that we k now and see. But what its essence is, or how it acts, we do not know, any mo re than we know the essence or the mode of action of the Crea tive Thought and Word of God. And again, what is that which we term galvanism and electricity, - which, evolved by the action of a little acid on two meta ls, aided by a magnet, circles the earth in a se cond, sending from land to land the Thoughts that govern the transactions of individuals and nations? The mi nd has formed no notion of matter, that will include it; a nd no name that we can give it, helps us to understand its essence and its being. It is a Power, like Thought and the Will. We know no more. What is this power of gravitation that makes ev erything upon the earth tend to the centre? How do es it reach out its invi sible hands toward the erratic meteor-stones, a rrest them in their swif t course, and draw them down to the earth's bosom? It is a power. We know no more. What is that heat which plays so wonderful a par t in the world' s economy? - that caloric, latent ev erywhere, within us and without us, produced by combustion, by intense pr essure, and by sw ift motion? Is it substance, matter, spirit, or imma terial, a mere Force or State of Matter? And what is light? A substa nce, say the books, - matt er, that travels to us from the sun and star s, each ray separable into seven, by the prism, of distinct colors, and with distinct peculiar qualities and action s. And if a substance, what is its essence, and w hat power is inherent in it, by which it journeys incalculable myriads of miles, and re aches us ten thousand years or more after it leaves the stars? All power is equally a myster y. Apply intense cold to a drop of water in the centre of a globe of iron, and the globe is shattered as the water freezes.

Nay, what is LIFE itself , with all its wondrous, might y energies, - that power which maintains the heat wi thin us, and prevents our bodies, that decay so soon without it, from resolu tion into their original elements - Li fe, that constant miracle, the nature and essence whereof have eluded all the philosophers; and all their learned dissertations on it are a mere jargon of words? No wonder the ancien t Persians though t that Light and Life were one, - both emanations from the Suprem e Deity, the archet ype of light. No wonder that in their ignorance they worshipped the Sun. God br eathed into man the spirit of life, - not matter, but an em anation from Himself; not a creature made by Him, nor a distin ct existence, but a Power, like His own Thought: and light, to those great-s ouled ancients, also seem ed no creature, and no gross material substance, but a pure emana tion from the Deity, immortal and indestructible like Himself. What, indeed, is REALITY? Our dreams are as real, wh ile they last, as the occurrences of the daytime . We see, hear, feel, ac t, experience pleasure and suffer pain, as vividl y and actually in a dream as when awake. The occurrences and transactions of a year are crowded into th e limits of a second: and the dream reme mbered is as real as t he past occurrences of life. The philosophers tell us that we have no cognizance of substance itself, but only of its attributes: that when we see that which we call a block of marble, our perceptions give us information only of something extended, solid, colored, heavy, and t he like; but not of the very th ing itself, to which these attributes belong. And yet the attributes do not exist without the substance. They are not substances, but adjectiv es. There is no such thing or existence as hardness, we ight or color, by it self, detache d from any subject, moving first here, th en there, and attaching itse lf to this and to the other subject. And yet, th ey say, the attributes are not the subject. So Thought, Volition, and Perception are not the soul, but its attributes; and we have no cognizance of the soul itself, but only of them, its manifestations. Nor of God; bu t only of His Wisdom, Power, Magnificence, Truth, a nd other attributes. And yet we know that ther e is matter, a soul with in our body, a God that lives in the Universe. Take, then, the attributes of the soul. I am consciou s that I exist and am the same identical person that I was twenty years ago. I am conscious that my body is not I, - that if my arms were lopp ed away, this person that I call ME, would still remain, complete , entire, identical as before. But I cannot ascertain, by the most intense and long-continued re flection, what I am, nor where with in my body I resi de, nor whether I am a point, or an expanded substance. I have no power to examin e and inspect. I exist, will, think, perceive. That I know, and nothing more. I think a noble and sublime Thought. What is t hat Thought? It is not Matt er, nor Spirit. It is"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"not a Thing; but a Po wer and Force. I make upon a paper certain conventional marks, that represent t hat Thought. There is no Power or Virtue in the marks I write, but only in the Thought which they tell to others. I die, but th e Thought still lives. It is a Power. It acts on men, excites them to enthusiasm, inspires patriotism, governs their conduct, controls their destinies, disposes of life and death. The wo rds I speak are but a certain succession of particula r sounds, that by conventional arrangement communicate to others the Immaterial , Intangible, Eternal Thought. The fact that Thought conti nues to exist an instant, after it makes its appearance in the soul, proves it immortal : for there is nothing conceivable that can destroy it. The spoken words, being mere sounds, may vanish into thin air, and the wr itten ones, mere marks, be burned, erased, destroyed: but the THOUGHT itself lives stil l, and must live on forever. A Human Thought, then, is an actual EXISTENC E, and a FORCE and POWER, capable of acting upon and controlling matter as well as mind. Is not the existence of a God, who is th e immaterial soul of the Universe, and whose THOUGHT, embodied or not embodied in His WORD, is an Infinite Power, of Creation and pro- duction, destruction and pr eservation, quite as co mprehensible as the existence of a Soul, of a Thought sepa rated from the Soul , of the Power of that Thought to mould the fate and influen ce the Destinies of Humanity? And yet we know not when that Thought comes, nor what it is. It is not WE. We do not mould it, sh ape it, fashion it. It is neither our mechanism nor our invention. It appears spontaneously, flashi ng, as it were, into the soul, making that soul the involuntary instrum ent of its utte rance to the world. It comes to us , and seems a stranger to us, seeking a home. As little can we explain the mighty power of the human WILL, Volition, like Thought, seems spontaneous, an effect without a cause. Circumstances provoke it, and serve as it s occasion, but do not produ ce it. It springs up in the soul, like T hought, as the waters gush upwa rd in a spring. Is it the manifestation of the soul , merely making apparent what passes within the soul, or an em anation from it, going abroad and acti ng outwardly, itself a real Existence, as it is an admit ted Power? We ca n but own our ignorance. It is certain t hat it acts on other souls, controls, di rects them, shapes their action, legisl ates for men and nations : and yet it is not material nor visible; and th e laws it writes merely n one soul of what has passed within another. God, therefore, is a myst ery, only as everything t hat surrounds us, and as we ourselves, are mysteries. We know that there is and must be a FIRST CAUSE. His attributes, seve red from Himself, are unre alities. As color and extension, weight and ha rdness, do not exist ap art from matter as separate existences and substantives, spiritual or imma terial; so the Goodness, Wisdom, justic e, Mercy, and Benevol ence of God are not independent existences, perso nify them as men may, but attributes of the Deity, the adjectives of One Great Substantiv e.

It is indeed the great Vice of the Age- -it, and its twin-sister, Dis honesty. Men, for political pr eferment, profess whatever principles are expedient and profitable. At the bar, in th e pulpit, and in the halls of legislation, men argue against their own convictions, and, wi th what they term logic, prove to the satisfaction of others that which they do not themselves believe. Insincerity and duplicity are va luable to their possessors, li ke estates in stocks, that yield a certain reve nue: and it is no longer the truth of an opinio n or a principle, but the net profit that may be realized from it, which is the m easure of its value."},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":" The Press is the great sower of falsehood. To slander a polit ical antagonist, to misrepresent a ll that he says, and, if that be impossible, to invent for him what he does not say; to put in circulation wh atever baseless calu mnies against him are necessary to defeat hi m,--these are habits so common as to have ceased to notice or comment, much less surprise or disgust. There was a time w hen a Knight would die rather than utter a lie or break his Knightly word. The Knight Co mmander of the Temple revive s the old Knightly spirit; and devotes himself to the Kni ghtly worship of Tr uth. No professi on of an opinion not his own, for ex pediency's sake or prof it, or through fear of the world's disfavor; no slander of even an enemy; no coloring or perversion of the sayings or acts of other men; no insincere speech and argument for any purpose, or under any pretext, must soil his fair e scutcheon. Out of the Chapter, as well as in it, he must speak the Truth, and all the Tr uth, no more and no less; or else speak not at all. To purity and innocence everywhere, the Kn ight Commander owes protection, as of old; against bold violence, or those, more guilt y than murderers, who by art and treachery seek to slay the soul; and against that want and destitution that drive too many to sell their honor and innocence for food. In no age of the world has man had better o pportunity than now to display those lofty virtues and that noble heroism that so distinguis hed the three grea t military and religious Orders, in their youth, befo re they became corrupt and vitiated by prosperity and power. When a fearful epidemic ravages a city, and death is inhale d with the air men breathe; when the livi ng scarcely suffice to bury the dead--most men flee in abject terror, to return and live , respectable and in fluential, when th e danger has passed away. But the old Knightly spirit of devotion and disinterestedness and contempt of death still lives, and is no t extinct in the human heart. Everywhere a few are found to stand firmly and unflinchingl y at their posts, to front and defy the danger, not for money, or to be honor ed for it, or to prot ect their own househol d; but from mere humanity, and to obey the unerring dictates of duty. They nurse the sick, breathing the pestilential atmosphere of the hospital. They expl ore the abodes of want and misery. With the gentlenes of woman, they soften the pains of the dying, and feed the lamp of life in the co nvalescent. They perform the last sad office s the dead; and they seek no other reward than t he approval their own consciences. These are the true Knights of the present age: these, an d captain who remains at his post on board his shattered ship un the last boat, loaded to the water's edge with passengers and crew, has par ted from her side ; and then goes calmly down with her into the myst erious depths of the ocean:--the pilot who stand s at the wheel while the swift flames eddy round him and scorch away hi s life:--the fireman who ascends the blazing walls, and plunges amid t he flames to save the property or lives of those who have upon hi m no claim by tie of blood, or friend ship, or even of ordinary acquaintance:--these, and others like these:--all men, who, set at the post of duty, stand t here manfully; to die, if need be, but not to desert their post: for these, too, are sworn not to recede before the enemy.

The unit is the symbol of ident ity, equality, existence, conserva tion and general harmony; the Central Fire, the Point within the Circle. Two, or the duad, is the symbol of diversity, inequality, division, separ ation, and vicissitudes. The figure 1 signifies the living man [a body sta nding upright] man being the only living being possessed of this faculty. Adding to it a head, we have the letter P, the sign of Paternity, Creative Power; and with a further addition, R, sign ifying man in motion, going, Iens, Iturus. The Duad is the origin of contrasts. It is the imperfect condition into which, according to the Pythagoreans, a being falls, when he detaches hims elf from the Monad, or God. Spiritual beings, emanating from God, are enveloped in the duad, and therefore rece ive only illusory impressions. As formerly the number ONE designated harmony, or der, or the Good Principle (the ONE and ONLY GOD, expressed in Latin Solus, whence the words Sol, Soleil, symbol of this God), the number Two expressed the contrary idea. T here commenced the fatal knowledg e of good and evil. Everything double, false opposed to the single and sole re ality, was expressed by the Binary number. It expressed also that state of cont rariety in which nature exists, where everything is double; night and day, light and darkness, cold and heat, wet and dr y, health and sickness, error and truth, one and the other sex, etc. Hence the Romans dedicated the second month in the year to Pluto, the God of Hell, and the second day of that month to the manes of the dead. The number One, with the Chinese, signified unity, harmony order, t he Good Principle, or God; Two, disorder, duplicity, falsehood. That people, in the earliest ages, based their whole philosophical system on the two primary figures or lines, one straight and unbroken, and the other broken or divided into two; doubling which, by placing on e under the other, and trebli ng by placing three under each other, they made the four sy mbols and eight Koua; which referr ed to the natural elements, and the primary principles of all things, and served symb olically or scientifically to express them. Plato terms unity and duality the original elements of natu re, and first principles of all existence: and the oldest sacred book of the Chinese says: \"The Gr eat First Principle has produced two equations and differences, or primary rules of existence; but t he two primary rules or two oppositions, namely YN"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"and YANG, or repose and motion, have produced four signs symbols, and the four symbols have produced the eight KOUA or further combinations.\" The interpretation of the Hermetic fables shows, among every ancient people, in their principal gods, first, 1, the Creating Monad, then 3, then 3 times 3, 3 times 9, and 3 times 27. This triple progression has for its foundation the three ages of Nature, the Past, the Present, and the Future; or the three degrees of universal generation. . . Birth, Life, Death. . . Beginning, middle, end. The Monad was male, because its action produces no change in itself, but only out of itself. It represented the creative principle. The Duad, for a contrary reason, was female, ever changing by additi on, subtraction, or multiplication. It represents matter capable of form. The union of the Monad and Duad produces the Tria d, signifying the world formed by the creative principle out of matter. Pythagoras represented th e world by the right-angled triangle, in which the squares of the two shortest side s are equal, added together, to the s quare of the longest one; as the world, as formed, is equal to the clea tive cause, and matter clothed with form. The ternary is the first of the unequal numbers. Th e Triad, mysterious number, which plays so great a part in the traditions of Asia and the philosophy of Plato, image of the Su preme Being, includes in itself the properties of the firs t two numbers. It was, to the Phil osophers, the most excellent and favorite number: a mysterious type, revered by all antiquity, and consecra ted in the Mysteries; wherefore there are but three essential Degrees am ong Masons; who venerate, in the triangle, the most august mystery, that of the Sacred Triad, object of their homage and study. In geometry, a line cannot represent a body absolut ely perfect. As little do two lines constitute a figure demonstratively perfect. But three lines fo rm, by their junction, the TRIANGLE, or the first figure regularly perfect; and this is why it has served and still serves to char acterize The Eternal; Who, infinitely perfect in His nature, is, as Univ ersal Creator, the first Be ing, and consequently the first Perfection. The Quadrangle or Square, perfect as it appears, being but the seco nd perfection, can in no wise represent God; Who is the first. It is to be noted that the name of God in Latin and French (Deus, Dieu), has for its initial the Delta or Greek Tr iangle. Such is the reason, among ancients and moderns, for the consecration of tne Triangle, whose three sides are emblems of the three Kingdoms, or Nature, or God. In the centre is t he Hebrew JOD, the Animating Spirit of Fire, the generative principle, represented by the letter G., initial of the name of Deit y in the languages of the North, and the meaning whereof is Generation. The first side of the Triangle, of fered to the study of the Appr entice, is the mineral kingdom, symbolized by Tub.'. The second side, the subject of the meditations of the Fellow Cr aft, is the vegetable kingdom, symbolized by Schib.'. (an ear of corn). In this re ign begins the Generation of bodies; and this is why the letter G., in its radiance, is presented to the ey es of the adept. The third side, the study whereof is devoted to t he animal kingdom, and completes the instruction of the Master, is symbolized by Mach.'. (Son of putrefaction). The figure 3 symbolizes the Earth. It is a figure of the terrestrial bodies. The 2, upper half of 3, symbolizes the vegetable world, the lo wer half being hidden from our sight. Three also referred to harmony, friendship, peac e, concord, and temperance; and was so highly esteemed among the Pythagoreans that they called it perfect harmony."},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"Three, four, ten, and twelve were sacred numbers among the Etrurians, as they were among the Jews, Egyptians, and Hindus. The name of Deity, in many Nations, consisted of three letters among the Greeks,I.'.A.'. Q.'.; among the Persians, H.'.O.'.M.'. among the Hindus, AUM; among the Scandi navians, I.'.O.'.W.'. On the upright Tablet of the King, discovered at Nimroud, no less than five of the thirteen names of the Great Gods consist of three letters each,--ANU, SAN, YAV, BAR, and BEI,. The quaternary is the most perfect number, and the root of other numbers, and of all things. The tetrad expresses the first mathematical power. F our represents also the generative power, from which all combinations are derived. The Initiates considered it the emblem of Movement and the Infinite, representing everything that is neither corporeal nor sensible. Pythagoras communicated it to his disciples as a symbol of the Eternal and Crea tive Principle, under the name of Quaternary, the Ineffable Name of God, which signi fies Source of everything that has received existence; and which, in Hebrew, is composed of four letters. In the Quaternary we find the first solid figure, th e universal symbol of immort ality, the pyramid. The Gnostics claimed that the whole edifice of their sci ence rested on a square whose angles were . . . Silence: Profundity: Intelligence; and Truth. For if the Triangle, figured by the number 3, forms the triangular base of the pyramid, it is unity which forms its point or summit. Lysias and Timaeus of Locria said that not a si ngle thing could be named, which did not depend on the quaternary as its root. There is, according to the Pythagoreans, a c onnection between the gods and numbers, which constitutes the kind of Divination called Arithmomancy. The soul is a number: it is moved of itself: it contains in itself the quaternary number. Matter being represented by the number 9, or 3 times 3, and the Immortal Spirit having for its essential hieroglyphic the quaternary or the number 4, the Sages said that Man, having gone astray and become entangled in an inextricab le labyrinth, in going from four to nine, the only way which he could take to emerge from these deceitful paths, these disastrous detours, an d the abyss of evil into which he had plunged, was to retrace his steps, and go from nine to four. The ingenious and mystical idea which caused the Triangle to be venerated, was applied to the figure 4 (4). It was said that it expressed a living being, I, bearer of the Triangle, the emblem of God; i. e., man bearing with himself a Divine principle. Four was a divine number; it referred to the Deit y, and many Ancient Nati ons gave God a name of four letters; as the Hebrews, the Egyptians AMUN , the Persians SURA, the Greeks, and the Latins DEUS. This was the Tetragrammaton of the Hebrews, and the Pythagoreans called it Tetractys, and swore their most solemn oath by it. So too ODIN among th e Scandinavians, ZEYS among the Greeks, PHTA among the Egyptians, THOTH among the Phoenicians, and AS-UR and NEBO among the Assyrians. The list might be indefinitely extended. The number 5 was considered as mysterious, becau se it was compounded of the Binary, Symbol of the False and Double, and the Ternary, so interesti ng in its results. It thus energetically expresses the state of imperfection, of order and disorder, of happiness an d misfortune, of lif e and death, which we see upon the earth. To the Mysterious Societies it offered the fearful image of the Bad Principle, bringing trouble into the inferior order,--in a word, the Binary acting in the Ternary. Under another aspect it was the emblem of marria ge; because it is compos ed of 2, the first equal number, and of 3, the first unequal number. Wheref ore Juno, the Goddess of Marriage, had for her"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"hieroglyphic the nwnber 5. Moreover, it has one of the properties of the number 9, that of reproducing itself, when multiplied by itself: there being always a 5 on the right hand of the product; a re sult which led to its use as a symbol of material changes. The ancients represented the world by the number 5. A reason for it, given by Diodorus, is, that it represents earth, water, a fire, and ether or spirit. T hence the origin of (5) and the Universe, as the whole. The number 5 designated the universal quintessence, and Symbolized, by its form the vital essence, the animating spir it which flows [serpentat] through all natur e. In fact, this ingenious figure is the union of the two Greek accents '', placed over thos e vowels which ought to be or ought not to be aspirated. The first sign ' bears the name of potent spirit; and signifies the S uperior Spirit, the Spirit of God aspirated (spiratus), respired by man. T he second sign ' is styled mild spirit, and represents the secondary spirit, th e spirit purely human. The triple triangle, a figure of five lines unitin g in five points, was among the Pythagoreans an emblem of Health. It is the Pentalpha of Pythagoras, or Pentangle of Solomon; has five lines and five angles; and is, among Masons, the outline or origin of the five -pointed Star, and an emblem of Fellowship. The number 6 was, in the Ancient Mysteries, a st riking emblem of nature; as presenting the six dimensions of all bodies: the six lines which make up their form, viz., the four lines of direction, toward the North, South, East, and West; with the two lines of he ight and depth, responding to the zenith and nadir. The sages applied the senary to the physical man; while the septenary was, for them, the symbol of his immortal spirit. The hieroglyphical senary (the double equilateral triangle) the symbol of Deity. Six is also an emblem of health, and the symbol of ju stic; because it is the fi rst perfect number; that is, the first whose aliquot parts (1/2, 1/3, 1/6, or 3, 2, and 1), added together, make itself. Ormuzd created six good spirits, and Ahriman six evil ones. These ty pify the six Summer and the six Winter months. No number has ever been so universally in repute as the septenary. Its celebrity is due, no doubt, to the planets being seven in number. It belongs al so to sacred things. The Pythagoreans regarded it as formed of the numbers 3 and 4; the first wher eof was, in their eyes, the image of the three material elements, and the second the principle of ev erything that is neither corporeal nor sensible. It presented them, from that point of view, th e emblem of everything that is perfect. Considered as composed of 6 and unity, it serves to designate the invisible centre or soul of everything; because no body exists , of which six lines do not cons titute the form, nor without a seventh interior point, as the centre and reality of the body, whereof the external dimensions give only the appearance. The numerous applications of t he septenary confirmed the ancient sages in the use of this symbol. Moreover, they exalted the properties of the num ber 7, as having, in a subordinate manner, the perfection of the unit: for if the unit is uncreated, if no number produces it, the seven is also not engendered by any number contained in the interval between 1 and 10. The number 4 occupies an arithmetical middle-ground between the unit and 7, inasmuch as it is as much over 1, as it is under 7, the difference each way being 3. The number 7, among the Egyptians, symbolized life; a nd this is why the letter Z of the Greeks was"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"the initial of the verb I live; and Jupiter, Father of Life. The number 8, or the octary, is composed of th e sacred numbers 3 and 5. Of the heavens, of the seven planets, and of the sphere of the fixed stars, or of the eternal unity and the mysterious number 7, is composed the ogdoade, the number 8, the fi rst cube of equal numbers, regarded as sacred in the arithmetical philosophy. The Gnostic ogdoade had eight stars, which represen ted the eight Cabiri of Samothrace, the eight Egyptian and Phoenician principles, the eight gods of Xenocrates, the eigh t angles of the cubic stone. The number eight symbolizes perfect ion: and its figure, 8 or (infinity) indicates the perpetual and regular course of the Universe. It is the first cube (2 X 2 X 2), and signifies fr iendship prudence, counsel , and justice. It was a symbol of the primeval law which regarded all men as equal. The novary, or triple ternary. If the number three was celebrated am ong the ancient sages, that of three times three had no less celebrity; because, according to them, each of the three elements which constitute our bodies is ternary: the wate r containing earth and fire; the earth containing igneous and aqueous particles; and the fire bein g tempered by globules of water terrestrial corpuscles which serve to feed it. No one of the three elements being entirely separated from the others, all material beings composed of these th ree elements, whereof each is triple, may be designated by the figurative number of three time s three, which has become the symbol of all formations of bodies. Hence the name of ninth envelope, given to ma tter. Every materi al extension, every circular line, has for representative sign the number nine, among th e Pythagoreans; who had observed the property which this number possesses , of reproducing itself incessantly and entire, in every multiplication; thus offering to the mind a ve ry striking emblem of matt er which is incessantly composed before our eyes, after having undergone a thousand decompositions. The number nine was consecrated to the Sphere s and the Muses. It is the sign of every circumference; because a circle of 360 degrees is equal to 9, that is to say, 3 + 6 + 0 = 9. Nevertheless, the ancients regarded this number with a sort of terror: they considered it a bad presage; as the symbol of versatility, of change and the emblem of the fr ailty of human affairs. Wherefore they avoided all numbers where nine a ppears, and chiefly 81, the product of 9 multiplied by itself, and the addition whereof, 8 + 1, again presents the number 9. As the figure of the number 6 was the symbol of t he terrestrial globe, animated by a divine spirit, the figure of the number 9 symbolized the earth, under the influence of the Evil Principle thence the terror it inspired. Nevertheless, according to Kaba lists, the figure 9 symbolizes the generative egg, or the image of a little globular being, from whose lower side seems to flow its spirit of life. The Ennead, signifying an aggregate of 9 things or persons, is the first s quare of unequal numbers. Every one is aware of the singular pr operties of the number 9, which, mu ltiplied by itself or any other number whatever, gives a result whose final su m is always 9, or always divisible by 9. Nine, multiplied by each of the ordinary number s, produces an arithmetic al progression, each member whereof, composed of two figures, presents a remarkable fact; for example: 1...2...3...4...5...6 ...7...8...9..10 9..18..27..36..45..54..63..72..81..90 The first line of figures gives the regular series, from 1 to 10."},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"The second reproduces this line doubly; first ascendi ng, from the first figure of 18, and then returning from the second figure of 81.

Containing all the numerical and harmonic relati ons, and all the properties of numbers which precede it, it concludes the Abacus or Table Pythagoras. To the Mysterious Societies, this number typified the assemblage of all the wonders of the Univer se. They wrote it thus (theta), that is to say, Unity in the middle of Zero, as t he centre of a circle, or symbol of Deity. They saw in this figure everything that should lead to refl ection: the centre, the ray, and the circumference, represented to them God, Man, and the Universe. This number was, among the Sages , a sign of concord, love, and peac e. To Masons it is a sign of union and good faith; because it is expressed by joining two hands, or the Master's grip, when the number of fingers gives 10: and it was re presented by the Tetractys of Pythagoras. The number 12, like the number 7, is celebrated in the worship of nature. The two most famous divisions of the heavens, that by 7, which is that of the planets, and that by 12, which is that of the Signs of the Zodiac, are found upon the religious monu ments of all the peoples of the Ancient World, even to the remote extremes of the East. Alth ough Pythagoras does not speak the number 12, it is none the less a sacred number. It is image of the Zodiac; and consequently th at of the Sun, which rules over it. Such are the ancient ideas in regard to those numb ers which so often appear in Masonry; and rightly understood, as the old Sages understood them, they contain many a pregnant lesson. Before we enter u pon the final lesson of Mas onic Philosophy, we will delay a few moments to repeat to you the Christian interpre tations of the Blue Degrees. In the First Degree, they said, there are three symbols to be applied. 1st. Man, after the fall, was left naked and defenceless against the just anger of the Deity. Prone to evil, the human race staggered blindly onward into the thick darkness of unb elief, bound fast by the strong cable-tow of the natural a nd sinful will. Moral co rruption was followed by physical misery. Want and destitution in vaded the earth. War and Famine and Pestilence f illed up the measure of evil, and over the sharp flints of misfortune and wretchedness man toiled with naked and bleeding feet. This condition of blindness, destitution, misery, and bondage, from which to save the world the Redeemer came, is symbolized by the condition of the candidate, when he is brought up for the first time to the door of the Lodge."},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"2d. Notwithstanding the death of the Redeemer, man can be saved only by faith, repentance, and reformation. To repent, he must feel the shar p sting of conscience and remorse, like a sword piercing his bosom. His confidence in his guide, w hom he is told to follow and fear no danger; his trust in God, which he is caused to profess; and the point of the sword that is pressed against his naked left breast over the heart, are symbolical of the faith, repentance and reformation necessary to bring him to the light of a life in Christ the Crucified. 3d. Having repented and reformed, and bound himself to the service of God by a firm promise and obligation, the light of Christian hope shines do wn into the darkness of the heart of the humble penitent, and blazes upon his pathway to Heaven. And this is symbolized by the candidate's being brought to light, after he is obligated, by the Wors hipful Master, who in t hat is a symbol of the Redeemer, and so brings him to light, with the help of the brethren, as He taught the Word with the aid of the Apostles. In the Second Degree there are two symbols: 4th. The Christian assumes new duties toward God and his fellows. Toward God, of love, gratitude, and veneration, and an anxious des ire to serve and glorify Him; to ward his fellows, of kindness, sympathy, and justice. And this assumption of duty this entering upon good works, is symbolized by the Fellow-Craft's obligation; by which, bound as an apprentice to secrecy merely, and set in the Northeast corner of the Lodge, he descends as a Fellow-Craft into the body of the brethren, and assumes the active duties of a good Mason. 5th. The Christian, reconciled to God, sees the worl d in a new light. This great Universe is no longer a mere machine, wou nd up and set go ing six thousand or sixty millions years ago, and left to run on afterward forever, by virtue of a law of mechanics created at the beginning, without further care or consideration on the part of the Deity; but it has now become to him a great emanation from God, the product of His thought, not a mere dead machi ne, but a thing of life, over which God watches continually, and every movement of which is immedi ately produced by His present action, the law of harmony being the essence of the Deity, re-enacted every instant. An d this is symbolized by the imperfect instruction given in th e Fellow-Craft's Degree, in the sciences, and particularly geometry, connected as the latter is with God Himself in the mind of a Mason, because the same letter, suspended in the East, represents both; and astrono my, or the knowledge of the laws of motion and harmony that govern the spheres, is but a portion of the wider science of geometry. It is so symbolized, because it is here, in the Second Degree, that the candidat e first receives an other than moral instruction. There are also two symbols in the Third Degree, wh ich, with the 3 in the first, and 2 in the second, make the 7. 6th. The candidate, after passing through the first part of the ceremony, imag ines himself a Master; and is surprised to be informed that as yet he is not, and that it is uncertain whether he ever will be. He is told of a difficult and dangerous path yet to be travelled, and is advised that upon that journey it depends whether he will become a Master. This is symbolical of that whic h our Saviour said to Nicodemus, that, notwithstanding his morals mi ght be beyond reproach, he could not enter the Kingdom of Heaven unless he were born again; symbolically dyi ng, and again entering the world regenerate, like a spotless infant. 7th. The murder of Hiram, his burial, and his bei ng raised again by the Mast er, are symbols, both of the death, burial, and resurrection of the Redeemer; and of the death and burial in sins of the natural man, and his being raised again to a new life, or born again, by the direct action of the Redeemer; after Morality (symbolized by the Entered Apprentice's grip), and Philosophy (symbolized by the grip of the Fellow-Craft), had failed to ra ise him. That of the Lion of the Ho use of Judah is the strong grip, never to be broken, with which Christ, of the royal line of that House, has clasped to Himself the whole human race, and embraces them in His wide arms as closely and affectionately as brethren embrace each other on the fi ve points of fellowship. As Entered Apprentices and Fellow-Crafts, Masons are taught to imitate the laudable example of"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"those Masons who labored at the building of King Solomon's Temple; and to plant firmly and deep in their hearts those foundation-stones of principle, truth, justice, te mperance, fortitude, prudence, and charity, on which to erect that Christian character which all the storms of misfortune and all the powers and temptations of Hell shall not prevail aga inst; those feelings and noble affections which are the most proper homage that can be paid to the Grand Architect and Great Father of the Universe, and which make the heart a living temple builded to Him: when the unruly passions are made to submit to rule and measurement, and thei r excesses are struck off with the gavel of self- restraint; and when every action and every princi ple is accurately corrected and adjusted by the square of wisdom, the level of humility, and the plumb of justice. The two columns, Jachin and Boaz, are the symbols of that profound faith and implicit trust in God and the Redeemer that are the Christian's strength ; and of those good works by which alone that faith can be established and made ope rative and effectual to salvation. The three pillars that su pport the Lodge are symbols of a Christian's HOPE in a future state of happiness; FAITH in the promis es and the divine character and mission of the Redeemer; and CHARITABLE JUDGMENT of other men. The three murderers of Khir-Om symbolize Pontiu s Pilate, Caiaphas the High-Priest, and Judas Iscariot: and the three blows given him are the betray al by the last, the refusal of Roman protection by Pilate, and the condemnation by the High-Priest. They also symbolize the blow on the ear, the scourging, and the crown of thorns . The twelve fellow-crafts sent in search of the body are the twelve disciples, in doubt whether to believe that the Redeemer would rise from the dead. The Master's word, supposed to be lost, symboliz es the Christian faith and religion, supposed to have been crushed and destroyed when the Saviour wa s crucified, after Isca riot had betrayed Him, and Peter deserted Him, and when the other disc iples doubted whether He would arise from the dead; but which rose from His tomb and flowed rapi dly over the civilized world; and so that which was supposed to be lost was found. It symbolizes al so the Saviour Himself; the WORD that was in the beginning--that was with God, and that was God; the Word of life, that was made flesh and dwelt among us, and was supposed to be lost, while He lay in the tomb, for three days, and His disciples \"as yet knew not the scripture that He must rise again from the dead,\" a nd doubted when they heard of it, and were amazed and frightened and st ill doubted when He app eared among them. The bush of acacia placed at th e head of the grave of Khir-Om is an emblem of resurrection and immortality. Such are the explanations of ou r Christian brethren; entitled, like those of all other Masons, to a respectful consideration. CLOSING INSTRUCTION. There is no pretence to infallibility in Masonry. It is not for us to dictate to any ma n what he shall believe. We have hitherto, in the instruction of the several Degrees, confined ourselves to aying before you the great thoughts that have found expres sion in the different ages of the world, leaving you to decide for yourself as to the orthodoxy or he terodoxy of each, and what proportion of truth, if any, each contained. We shall pursue no other cour se in this closing Philoso phical instruction; in which we propose to deal with the highest questi ons that have ever exercised the human mind,--with the existence and the nature of a God, with the ex istence and the natnre of the human soul, and with the relations of the divine and human spirit with the merely material Universe. There can be no questions more important to an in telligent being, none that have fo r him a more direct and personal interest; and to this last word of Scottish Masonry we invite your serious an d attentive c onsideration. And, as what we shall now say will be but the co mpletion and rounding-off of what we have already said in several of the preceding Degrees, in re gard to the Old Thought and the Ancient Philosophies,"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"we hope that you have noted and not forgotten our pr evious lessons, without which this would seem imperfect and fragmentary. In its idea of rewarding a faithf ul and intelligent workman by conf erring upon him a knowledge of the True Word, Masonry has perpetuated a very great trut h, because it involves the proposition that the idea which a man forms of God is always the most im portant element in his sp eculative theory of the Universe, and in his particular practical plan of action for the Church, the State, the community, the Family, and his own individual life. It will ever make a vast difference in the conduct of a people in war or peace, whether they believe the Supreme Go d to be a cruel Deity, delighting in sacrifice and blood, or a God of Love; and an indi vidual's speculative theory as to the mode and extent of God's govermnent, and as to the nature and reality of his own free-will and consequent responsibility, will needs; have great influence in shaping the course of his life and conversation. We see every day the vast influence of the popular id ea of God. All the great hi storical civilizations of the race have grown out of the national ideas which were formed of God; or have been intimately connected with those ideas. The p opular Theology, which at first is only an abstract idea in the heads of philosophers, by and by shows itself in the laws, and in the punishments for crime, in the churches, the ceremonies and the sacraments, th e festivals and the fast s, the weddings, the baptisms and the funerals, in the hospitals, the college s, the schools, and all the social charities, in the relations of husband and wife, parent and child, in the daily work and the daily prayer of every man. As the world grows in its development, it necessari ly outgrows its ancient id eas of God, which were only temporary and provisional. A man who has a hi gher conception of God than those about him, and who denies that their conception is God, is very likely to be called an Atheist by men who are really far less believers in a God than he. Thus the Christians, who said the Heathen idols were no Gods, were accounted Atheist s by the People, and accordingly put to death; and Jesus of Nazareth was crucified as an unbelieving blasphemer, by the Jews. There is a mere formal Atheism, which is a denial of God in terms, but not in reality. A man says, There is no God; that is, no God that is self-originated, or that never originated, but always WAS and HAD BEEN, who is the cause of existence, who is the Mind and the Providenc e of the Universe; and so the order, beauty, and harmony of the world of matter and mind do not indicate any plan or purpose of Deity. But, he says, NATURE,-- meaning by that the whole sum-tota l of existence,-- that is powerful, active, wise, and good; Nature is self -originated, or always was and had been, the cause of its own existence, the mind of the Universe and the Providence of itself. There is obviously a plan and purpose whereby order, beauty, and harmony ar e brought about; but all that is the plan and purpose of nature. In such cases, the absolute denial of God is only formal and no t real. The qualities of God are admitted, and amrmed to be real; and it is a mere change of name to call the possessor of those qualities, Nature, and not God. The real question is, whether such Qualities exist, as we call God; and not, by what particular name we shall designate the Qualities. One man may call the sum total of these Qualities, Nature; another, Heaven; a third, Universe, a fourth , Matter; a fifth, Spirit; a sixth, God, Theos, Zeus, Alfadir, Allah, or what he pleas es. All admit the existence of the Being, Power, or ENS, thus diversely named. The name is of the smallest consequence. Real Atheism is the denial of the ex istence of any God, of the actualit y of all possible ideas of God. It denies that there any Mind, Intellig ence, or ENS, that is the Cause and Providence of the Universe, and of any Thing or any Existence, Soul, Spirit, or Being, that intentionally or intelligently produces the Order, Beauty, and Harmony thereof, and the cons tant and regular modes of operation therein. It must necessarily deny that there is any law, order, or harmony in existence, or any constant mode of operation in the world; for it is utterly impossible for any human cr eature to conceive, however much he may pretend to do so, of either of these, except as a consequence of the action of Intelligence; which is, indeed, that otherwise unknown thing, the existence of wh ich these alone prove; otherwise than as the cause of these, not a thing at all; a mere name for the wholly uncognizable cause of these."},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"The real atheist must deny the existe nce of the Qualities of God, deny that there is any mind of or in the Universe, any self-conscious Providence, any Prov idence at all. He must deny that there is any Being or Cause of Finite things, that is self-consc iously powerful, wise, jus t, loving, and faithful to itself and its own nature. He must deny that there is any plan in the Universe or any part of it. He must hold, either that matter is eternal, or that it originated itsel f, which is absurd, or that it was originated by an Intelligence, or at least by a C ause; and then he admits a God. No doubt it is beyond the reach of our faculties to imagine how matter originated,--how it began to be, in space where before was nothing, or God only. But it is equally beyond the reach of our faculties to imagine it eternal and unorigi nated. To hold it to be eter nal, without thought or will; t hat the specific forms of it, the seed, the rock, the tree, t he man, the solar system, all came with no forethought planning or producing them, by \"chance\" or \"the fortuitous concourse of atoms\" of matter that has no thought or will; and that they indicate no mind, no plan, no purp ose, no providence, is abs urd. It is not to deny the existence of what we underst and by mind, plan, purpose, Providence; but to insist that these words shall have some other meaning than that which the human race has ever attached to them: shall mean some unknown thing, for which the human race has no name, because it has of such a thing no possible idea. Either there never was any su ch thing as a \"plan,\" an d the word is nonsense, or the Universe exists in conformity to a plan. The word never meant, and never can mean, any other thing than that which the Universe exhibits . So with the word \"purpose;\" so with the word \"Providence.\" They mean nothing, or else only what the Universe proves. It was soon found that the denial of a Conscious Power, the cause of ma n and of his life, of a Providence, or a Mind and Intelligen ce arranging man in reference to the world, and the world in reference to man, would not satisf y the instinctive desires of human nature, or account for the facts of material nature. It did not long answer to say, if it ever was said , that the Universe was drifting in the void inane, and neither it, nor any mind within or without it, knew of its w hence, its whither, or its whereabouts; that man was drifting in the Universe, knowing little of his whereabouts, nothing of his whence or whither; that there was no Mind, no Prov idence, no Power, that kn ew any better; nothing that guided and directed man in his drifting, or the Universe in the weltering waste of Time. To say to man and woman, \"your heroism, your bravery, your self-denial all comes to nothing: your nobleness will do you no good you will die, and your nobleness will do mankind no service; for there is no plan or order in all these things; everything comes and goes by the fortuitous c oncourse of atoms ;\" did not, nor ever will, long satisfy the human mind. True, the theory of Atheism has been uttered. It has been said, \"Death is the end: this is a world without a God: you are a body without a soul: there is a Here, but no Hereafter for you; a Earth, but no Heaven. Die, and return to your dust. Man is bones, blood, bowels, and brain; mind is matter: there is no soul in the brain, nothing but nerves. We can see all the way to a little star in the nebula of Orion's belt; so distant that it will take light a thous and millions of years to come from it to thc earth, journeying at the rate of twelve millions of mile s a minute. There is no Heaven this side of that: you see all the way through: there is not a speck of Heaven; and do you think there is any beyond it; and if so, when would you reach it? There is no Pr ovidence. Nature is a fo rfuitous concourse of atoms; though is a fortuitous function of matter, a fortuitous result of a fo r tuitous result, a chance- shot from the great wind-gun of the Universe, accidentally loaded, pointed at random, and fired off by chance. Things happen; they are not arranged. Ther e is luck, and there is ill-luck; but there is no Providence. Die you into dust!\" Does all this satisf y the human instinct of i mmortality, that makes us ever long, with unutterable longing, to join our selves again to our dear ones who have gone away before us, an to mankind, for eternal life? Does it satisfy our mighty hungering and thirst for immortality, our anxious longing to come nearer to , and to know more of, the Eternal Cause of all things? Men never could be content to believe that there was no mind that thought for man, no conscience to enact eternal laws, no hear to love those whom nothing of earth loves or cares for, no will of the Universe to marshal the nations in the way of wisdom, just ic and love. History is not--thank God! we know it is not,--the fortuitous co ncourse of events, or Nature that of atoms. We can not believe that there is no plan nor purpose in Nature, to guid our going out and coming in: that there is a mighty going, but goes nowhere; that all beauty, wisdom, affe ction, justice, morality in the world, is an accident, and may end to-morrow. All over the world there is heroism unrequited, or paid with misery; vice on thrones, corruption in"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"high places, nobleness in poverty or even in ch ains, the gentle devotion of woman rewarded by brutal neglect or more brutal abuse and violen ce; everywhere want, misery, over-work, and under- wages. Add to these the Atheist's creed,--a body without a soul, an earth without Heaven, a world without a God; and what a Pandemoniu m would we make of this world ! The intellect of the Atheist woul d find matter everywhere; but no Causing and Providing Mind: his moral sense would find no Equitable Will, no Beauty of Moral Excellence, no Conscience enacting justice into the unchanging law of right, no spiritual Order or spiritual Providence, but only material Fate and Chance. His affections would find only fini te things to love; and to them the dead who were loved and who died yesterday, are like the rainbow t hat yesterday evening lived a moment and then passed away. His soul, flying through the vast I nane, and feeling the da rkness with its wings, seeking the Soul of all, which at once is Reason, Conscience, and the Heart of all that is, would find no God, but a universe all disorder; no Infinite, no Reason, no Conscience, no Heart, no Soul of things; nothing to reverence, to esteem, to love, to worship, to trust in; but only an Ugly Force, alien and foreign to us, that strikes down those we love, and makes us mere worms on the hot sand of the world. No voice would speak from the Earth to comfor t him. It is a cruel mother, that great Earth, that devours her young,--a Force and nothing more. Out of the sky would smile no kind Providence, in all its thousand starry eyes; and in storms a malignant violence, with its lightning-sword, would stab into the darkness, seeking for men to murder. No man ever was or ever can be content with that. The evidence of God has been ploughed into Nature so deeply, and so deeply woven into the te xture of the human soul, that Atheism has never become a faith, though it has sometimes assumed the shape of theory. Religion is natural to man. Instinctively he turns to God and reverences and relies on Him. In the Mathematics of the Heavens, written in gorgeous diagrams of fire, he sees la w, order, beauty, harmony without end: in the ethics of the little nations that inhabit the ant-hills he sees the same; in all Nature, animat e and inanimate, he sees the evidences of a Design, a Will, an Intelligence, and a God,--of a God benefic ent and loving as well as wise, and merciful and indulgent as well as powerful. To man, surrounded by the material Universe, and conscious of the influ ence that his material environments exercised upon his fortunes and his pres ent destiny;--to man, ever confronted with the splendors of the starry heavens, the regular marc h of the seasons, the phenomena of sunrise and moonrise, and all evidences of intelligence and design that everywhere presse upon and overwhelmed him, all imaginable questions as to the nature and cause of these phenomena constantly recurr ed, demanding to be solved, and refusing to be sent away unanswered. And still, after the lapse of ages, press upon the human mi n and demand solution, the same great questions-- perhaps still demandi ng it in vain. Advancing to the period when man had ceased to look upon the separate pa rts and individual forces of the Universe as gods; when he had come to look upon it as a whole, this question, among the earliest, occurred to him, and insisted on being answ ered: \"Is this material Universe self-existent, or was it created? Is eternal, or did it originate?\" And then in succession came crowding on the human mind t hese other questions: \"Is this material Universe a mere aggregate of fortui tous combinations of matter, or is it the result and work of intelligen acting upon a plan? \"If there be such an Inte lligence, what and where is it? Is mate rial Universe itse lf an Intelligent being? Is it like man, body and a soul ? Does Natu re act upon itself, or is there a Cause beyond it that acts upon it? \"If there is a personal God, separate from the ma terial Universe, that cr eated all things, Himself uncreated, is He corporeal or incorporeal, material or spiritual, the soul of the Universe or wholly apart from it? and if He be Spirit, what then is spirit?"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"\"Was that Supreme Deity active or quiescent before the creation; and if quiescent during a previous eternity, what necess of His nature moved Him at last to create a world; or was it a mere whim that had no motive? \"Was matter co-existent with Him, or absolutely created him out of nothing? Did He create it, or only mould and shape and fashion a chaos already existing, co-existent with Himself? \"Did the Deity directly create matte r, or was creation the work of in ferior deities, emanations from Himself? \"If He be good and just, whence comes it that, fo reknowing everything, He has allowed sorrow and evil to exist; and how to reconcile with His benevol ence and wisdom the prosperity of vice and the misfortunes of virtue in this world?\" And then, as to man himself, recurred these other ques tions, as they continue to recur to all of us: \"What is it in us that thinks ? Is Thought the mere re sult of material organization; or is there in us a soul that thinks, separate from and resident in the body? If the latter, is it eternal and uncreated; and if not, how created? Is it distinct from God, or an emanation from Him? Is it inherently immortal, or only so by destination, because God has willed it? Is it to return to and be merged in Him, or ever to exist, separately from Him , with its present identity? \"If God has fore-seen and fore-arranged all that occurs, how has man any real free- will, or the least control over circumstanc es? How can anything be done against the will of In finite Omnipotence; and if all is done according to that will, how is there any wrong or evil, in what Infinite Wisdom and Infinite Power does not choose to prevent? \"What is the foundation of the moral law? Did God enact it of His own mere pleasure; and if so, can He not, when He pleases, repeal it ? Who shall assure us He will not repeal it, and ma ke right wrong, and virtue vice? Or is the moral law a necessity of His nature; and if so, who enacted it; and does not that assert a power, like the ol d Necessity, superior to Deity?\" And, close-following after these, came the great question of HEREAFTER, of another Life, of the soul's Destiny; and the thousand other collateral and subordinate questions, as to matter, spirit, futurity, and God, that have produced all the systems of philosophy, all metaphysics, and all theology, since the world began. What the old philosophic mind thought upon these great questions, we have already, to some extent, developed. With the Emanation-doctrine of the Gnostics and the Orient, we have endeavored to make you familiar. We have br ought you face to face with the Kabalists, the Essenes, and Philo the Jew. We have shown that, and how, much of the old mythology was derived from the daily and yearly recurring phenomena of the heavens. We hav e exhibited to you the anc ient notions by which they endeavored to explain to themselves the exis tence and prevalence of evil; and we have in some degree made known to you their metaphysical ideas as to the nat ure of the Deity. Much more remains to be done than it is within our power to do. We stand upon the sounding shore of the great ocean of Time. In front of us stretches out the heav ing waste of the illimitable Past; and its waves, as they roll up to our feet along the sparking slope of the yellow sands, bring to us, nw and then, from the depths of that boundless ocean, a shell, a few sp ecimens of algae torn rudely from their stems, a rounded pebble; and that is all; of all the vast treas ures of ancient thought that lie buried there, with the mighty anthem of the boundless ocean th undering over them forever and forever. Let us once more, and for the last time, along the s hore of that great ocean, gather a few more relics of the Past, and listen to its mighty voices, as t hey come, in fragmentary music, in broken and interrupted rhythm, whispering to us from the great bosom of the Past. "},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"Rites, creeds, and legends express, directly or sy mbolically, some leading idea, according to which the Mysteries of Being are supposed to be expl ained in Deity. The intricacies of mythical genealogies are a practical acknowledgment of t he mysterious nature of the Omnipotent Deity; displaying in their beautiful but ineffectual imagery the first efforts of the mi nd to communicate with nature: the flowers which fancy strewed before the yo uthful steps of Psyche, when she first set out in pursuit of the immortal object of her love. Theori es and notions, in all their varieties of truth and falsehood, are a machinery more or less efficacious, directed to the same end. Every religion was, in its origin, an embryo philosophy, or an attempt to interpret the unknown by mind; and it was only when philosophy, which is essentially progress, outgrew its firs t acquisitions, that religion became a thing apart, cherishing as unalterable dogmas the notions which philosophy had abandoned. Separated from philosophy, it became arrogant and fa ntastical, professing to have already attained what its more authentic representative was ev er pursuing in vain; and discovering, through its initiations and Mysteries, all that to its contracted view seemed wanting to re store the well-being of mankind, the means of purificati on and expiation, remedies for di sease, expedients to cure the disorders of the soul, and to propitiate the gods. Why should we attempt to confine the idea of th e Supreme Mind within an arbitrary barrier, or exclude from the limits of veracity any conception of the Deity, which, if im perfect and inadequate, may be only a little more so than our own? \"The name of God,\" says Hobbes, \"is used not to make us conceive Him, or He is inconceivable, but th at we may honor Him.\" \"Believe in God, and adore Him,\" said the Greek Poet, \"but investigate Him not; the inquiry is fruitless, seek not to discover who God is; for, by the desire to k now, you offend Him who chooses to remain unknown.\" \"When we attempt,\" says Philo, \"to investigate the essence of the Absolute Being, we fall into an abyss of perplexity; and the only benefit to be derived from such researches is the conviction of their absurdity.\" Yet man, though ignorant of the constitution of the dust on which he treads , has ventured, and still ventures, to speculate on the nature of God, and to define dogmatically in creeds the subject least within the compass of his facultie s; and even to hate and persecute those who will not accept his views as true. But though a knowledge of the Divine Essence is impossible, the concepti ons formed respecting it are interesting, as indications of intellectual develop ment. The history of religion is the history of the human mind; and the conception formed by it of Deity is always in exact relation to its moral and intellectual attainments. The one is th e index and the measure of the other. The negative notion of God, which consists in abstracting the inferi or and finite, is, according to Philo, the only way in which it is possible for man worthily to apprehend the nature of God. After exhausting the varieties of symbolis m, we contrast the Divine Greatn ess with human littleness, and employ expressions apparently affirmative, such as \"Infinite,\" \"Almighty,\" \"Allwise,\" \"Omnipotent,\" \"Eternal,\" and the like; which in reality amount only to denying, in regard to God, those limits which confine the faculties of man; and thus we remain content with a name which is a mere conventional sign and confession of our ignorance. The Hebrew and the Greek To ON expressed abstrac t existence, without ou tward manifestation or development. Of the same nature are the definitions , \"God is a sphere whose centre is everywhere, and whose circumference nowhere;\" \"God is He who se es all, Himself unseen:\" and finally, that of Proclus and Hegel --\"the To --that which has no outward and positive exist ence.\" Most of the so- called ideas or definitions of the \"Absoute\" are only a collection of negations; from which, as they affirm nothing, nothing is learned. God was first recognized in the heavenly bodies and in the elements. When man's consciousness of his own intellectuality was matured, and he became convinced that the internal faculty of thought was something more subtle than even the most s ubtle elements, he transferred that new conception to the object of his worship, and deified a mental principle instead of a physical one. He in every case makes God after his own image; for do what we will, the highe st efforts of hu man thought can conceive nothing higher than the supremacy of intellect; and so he ever comes back to some familiar type of exalted humanity. He at first deifies nature, a nd afterward himself."},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"The eternal aspiration of the religious sentiment in man is to become united with God. In his earliest development, the wish and its fulfillment were simultaneous, through unquestioning belief. In proportion as the conception of De ity was exalted, the notion of His terrestrial presence or proximity was abandoned and the difficulty of comprehendi ng the Divine Government, together with the glaring superstitious evils arising out of its misinterpret ation, endangered the belief in it altogether. Even the lights of Heaven, which, as \"bright pot entates of the sky,\" were formerly the vigilant directors of the economy of earth now shine dim and distant, and Uriel no more descends upon a sunbeam. But the real change has been in the progre ssive ascent of man's own faculties, and not in the Divine Nature; as the Stars are no more distant now than when they were supposed to rest on the shoulders of Atlas. And yet a little sense of disappointment and humiliation a ttended the first awakening of the soul, when reason, looking upwa rd toward the Deity, wa s impressed with a dizzy sense of having fallen. But hope revives in despondency; and every nation that ever advanced beyond the most elementary conceptions, felt the necessity of an attempt to fill the chasm, real or imaginary, sepa rating man from God. To do this was the great task of poetry, ph ilosophy, and religion. Hence the personifications of God's attributes, developments, and manifestat ions, as \"Powers,\" \"Intelligences,\" \"Angels,\" \"Emanations;\" through which and the oracular fa culty in himself, man could place himself in communion with God. The various ranks and orders of mythical beings im agined by Persians, Indians, Egyptians, or Etrurians, to preside over the various departmen ts of nature, had each his share in a scheme to bring man into closer approximation to the Deity; they eventually gave way only before an analogous though less picturesque symbolis m; and the Deities and Daemons of Greece and Rome were perpetuated with only a change of nam es, when their offices were transferred to Saints and Martyrs. The attempts by which reason had sometimes endeavored to span the unknown by a bridge of metaphysics, such as the idealistic systems of Zoro aster, Pythagoras, or Plato, were only a more refined form of the poetical illusi ons which satisfied the vulgar; and man still look ed back with longing to the lost golden age, when his ancestors co mmuned face to face with the Gods; and hoped that, by propitiating Heaven, he might accelerate the renew al of it in the islands of the Far West, under the sceptre of Kronos, or in a centralization of political power at Jerusalem. His eager hope overcame even the terrors of the grave; for the Divine power was as infini te as human expectation, and the Egyptian, duly ensepulchred in the Lybian Catacombs, was supposed to be already on his way to the Fortunate Abodes under the guidance of Hermes, there to obtain a perfect association and reunion with his God. Remembering what we have already said elsewhere in regard to the old ideas concerning the Deity, and repeating it as little as possible, let us once more put ourselves in communion with the Ancient poetic and philosophic mind, and endeavor to learn of it what it thought, and how it solved the great problems that have ever tortured the human intellect. The division of the First and Su preme Cause into two parts, one Acti ve and the other Passive, the Universe Agent and Patient, or the hermaphroditi c God-World, is one of the most ancient and widespread dogmas of philosophy or natural theology. Almost every ancient people gave it a place in their worship, their myst eries, and their ceremonies. Ocellus Lucanus, who seems to have lived shortly af ter Pythagoras opened his School in Italy, five or six hundred years before our era, and in the time of Solon, Thales, and the other Sages who had studied in the Schools of Egypt, not only recogniz es the eternity of the Universe, and its divine character as an unproduced and indestructible being, but also the distincti on of Active and Passive causes in what he terms the Grand Whole, or th e single hermaphroditic Being that comprehends all existences, as well causes as effects; and whic h is a system regularly ordered, perfect and complete, of all Natures. He well apprehended the dividing line that separat es existence eternally the same, from that which eternally changes; the natu re of celestial from that of terrestrial bodies, that of causes from that of effects, that which is from that which only BECOMES,--a distinction that"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"naturally struck every thinking man. We shall not quote his language at full length. Th e heavenly bodies, he thought, are first and most noble; they move of themselves, and ever revolve, without change of form or essence. Fire, water, earth, and air change incessantly and continually, not place, but form. Then, as in the Universe there are generation and cause of generation,--as generat ion is where there are change and displacement of parts, and cause where there is stability of nature, evidently it belongs to what is the cause of generation, to move and to act, and to the recipi ent, to be made and moved. In his view, everything above the Moon was the habitation of the gods; all bel ow, that of Nature and discord; this operates dissolution of things made; that, production of those that are being made. As the world is unproduced and indest nlctible, as it had no beginning, and will have no end, necessarily the principle that operates generation in another than itself , and that which operates it in itself, have co- existed. The former is all above the moon, and especially the sun: the latter is the s ublunary world. Of these two parts, one active, the other passi ve--one divine and always the same, the other mortal and ever changing, all that we call the \"wor ld\" or \"universe\" is composed. These accorded with the principles of the Egypti an philosophy, which held t hat man and the animals had always existed together with t he world; that they were its effe cts, eternal like itself. The chief divisions of nature into active and passive causes, its system of generation and des truction, and the concurrence of the two great prin ciples, Heaven and earth, uniting to form all things, will, according to Ocellus, always continue to exist. \"Enough.\" he concludes, \"as to the Universe, the generations and destructions effected in it, the mode in which it now exists , the mode in which it will ever exist, by the eternal qualities of the two principles, one always movi ng, the other always moved; one always governing, the ot her always governed.\" Such is a brief summary of the doctrine of this philosopher, whose work is one of the most ancient that has survived to us. The subject on which he tr eated occupied in his time all men's minds: the poets sang of cosmogonies and theogonies, and the philosophers wrote treatises on the birth of the world and the elements of its composition. The cosmog ony of the Hebrews, attr ibuted to Moses; that of the Phoenicians, ascribed to Sanchoniathon; that of the Greeks, composed by Hesiod; that of the Egyptians, the Atlantes, and the Cretans, preser ved by Diodorus Siculus; the fragments of the theology of Orpheus, divided among different writers; the books of the Persians, or their Boundehesh; those of the Hindus; the traditions of the Chinese a nd the people of Macassar; the cosmogonic chants which Virgil puts in the mouth of Iopas at Carthage; and those of the old Silenus, the first book of the Metamorphoses of Ovid; all te stify to the aniquity a nd universality of these fictions as to the origin of the world and its causes. At the head of the causes of nature, Heaven and earth were la ced; and the most apparent parts of each, the sun, the moon, the fixed stars and planet s, and, above all, the zodiac, among the active causes of generation; and among the passive, the several elements. These causes were not only classed in the progressive order of their energy, Heaven and earth h eading the respective lists, but distinct sexes were in some sort assigned to them, and characteristics analogous to the mode in which they concur in universal generation. The doctrine of Ocellus was the general doctrine ever ywhere, it naturally occurring to all to make the same distinction. The Egyptians did so, in select ing those animals in which they recogized these emblematic qualities, in order to symbolize the do uble sex of the Universe. Their God KNEPH, out of whose mouth issued the Orphic egg, whence the author of the Clementin e Recognitions makes a hermaphroditic figure to emerge, uniting in itself the two principles whereof Heaven and the earth are forms, and which enter into the organizati on of all beings which the heavens and the earth engender by their concourse, furnishes another em blem of the double power , active and passive, which the ancients saw in the Universe, and whic h they symbolized by the egg. Orpheus, who studied in Egypt, borrowed from the theologians of that country the myst erious forms under which the science of nature was veiled, and carried into Greece the symbolic egg, with its division into two"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"parts or causes figured by the hermaphroditic bei ng that issued from it, and whereof Heaven and earth are composed. The Brahmins of India expressed the same cosm ogonic idea by a statue, representative of the Universe, uniting in itself both sexes. The male se x offered an image of the su n, centre of the active principle, and the female sex that of the moon, at the sphere whereof, proceeding downward, the passive portion of nature begins. The Lingam, unto t he present day revered in the Indian temples, being but the conjunction of the organs of generatio n of the two sexes, was an emblem of the same. The Hindus have ever had the great est veneration for this symbol of ever-reproductive nature. The Greeks consecrated the same symbols of universal fruitfulness in their Mysteries; and they were exhibited in the sanctuaries of Eleusis. They appear among the sculptured ornaments of all the Indian temples. Tertullian accuses the Valentinia ns of having adopted the custom of venerating them; a custom, he says, introduced by Melam pus from Egypt into Greece. The Egyptians consecrated the Phallus in the Mysteries of Osiris and Isis, as we learn from Plutarch and Diodorus Siculus; and the latter assures us that these embl ems were not consecrated by the Egyptians alone, but by every people. They certainly were so am ong the Persians and Assyrians; and they were regarded everywhere as symbolic of the generative and productive powers of all animated beings. In those early ages, the works of Nature and all her agents were sacred like herself. For the union of Nature with hers elf is a chaste marriage, of whic h the union of man and woman was a natural image, all their organs were an expressi ve emblem of the double energy which manifests itself in Heaven and Earth uniting together to produce all beings. \"The Heavens,\" says Plutarch, \"seemed to men to fulfill the func tions of father, and the Earth of mother. The former im pregnated the earth with its fertiliz ing rains, and the earth, receiving them , became fruitful and brought forth.\" Heaven, which covers and embraces the earth everyw here, is her potent spouse, uniting himself to her to make her fruitful, without which she would lan guish in everlasting ster ility, buried in the shades of chaos and of night. Their union is their marriage their productions or parts are their children. The skies are our Father, and Nature the great Mother of us all. This idea was not the dogma of a single sect, but the general opinion of all the Sages. \"Nature was divided,\" says Cicero, \"into two parts, one active, a nd the other that submitted itself to this action, which it received, and which modi fied it. The former was deemed to be a Force, and the latter the material on which that Force exer ted itself.\" Macrobius repeated al most literally the doctrine of Ocellus. Aristotle termed the earth the fruitful mother, environed on all sides by the air. Above it was Heaven, the dwelling-place of the gods and the divine stars, its substance ether, or a fire incessantly moving in circles, divine and incorruptible, and subject to no change. Below it, nature, and the elements, nutable and acted on, corruptible and mortal. Synesius said that generations were effected in the portions of the Universe which we inhabit; while the cause of generations resided in the portions above us, whence descend to us the germs of the effects produced here below. Proclus and Simpliciu s deemed Heaven the Active Cause and Father, relatively to the earth. The former says that the World or the Whole is a single Animal; what is done in it, is done by it; the same World acts, and ac ts upon itself. He divides it into \"Heaven\" and \"Generation.\" In the former, he says, are plac ed and arranged the cons ervative causes of generation, superintended by the Genii and Gods. T he Earth, or Rhea, associated ever with saturn in production, is mother of the effects of which Heaven is Father; the womb or bosom that receives the fertilizing energy of the God that engenders ages. The great work of generation is operated, he says, primarily by the action of the Sun, and secon darily by that of the Moon, so that the Sun is the primitive source of this energy, as father and chie f of the male gods that form his court. He follows the action of the male and female principles through all the portions a nd divisions of nature, attributing to the forme r the origin of stabilit y and identity, to the latter, th at of diversity and mobility. Heaven is to the earth, he says, as the male to the female. It is the movement of the heavens that, by their revolutions, furnished the seminal incite ments and forces, whose em anations received by the earth, make it fruitful, and cause it to produce animals and plants of every kind. Philo says that Moses recognized th is doctrine of two causes, ac tive and passive; but made the former to reside in the Mind or Intelligence external to matter."},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"The ancient astrologers divided th e twelve signs of the Zodiac into six male and six female, and assigned them to six male a six female Gods. H eaven and Earth, or Ouranos and Ghe, were among the most ancient nations, the firs t and most ancient Divinities. We find them in the Phoenician history of Sanchoniathon, and in the Grecian Genealogy of the Gods given by Hesiod. Everywhere they marry, and by their union produce the later Gods. \"In the beginning.\" says Apollodorus, \"Ouranos or the Heavens was Lord of all the Universe: he took to wife Ghe or the earth, and had by her many children.\" They were the first Gods of the Cretan s, and under other names, of the Armenians, as we learn from Berosus, and of Panchaia, an island South of Arabia, as we learn from Euhemerus. Orpheus made the Divinity or the \"Great Whole, \" male and female, because, he said, it could produce nothing, unless it united in itself the pr oductive force of both sexes. He called Heaven PANGENETOR, the Father of all things, most ancient of Beings, beginning and end of all, containing in Himself the incorruptible and unwearying force of Necessity. The same idea obtained in the rude North of Europe. The Scythians made the earth to be the wife of Jupiter; and the Germans adored her under the name of HERTA. The Celts worshipped the Heavens and the Earth, and said that without the former the latter would be sterile, and that their marriage produced all things. The Scandinavians acknowledged BOR or the Heavens, and gave FURTUR, his son, the Earth as hi s wife. Olaus Rudbeck adds, that their ance stors were persuaded that Heaven intermarried with the Earth, and thus uniting his forc es with hers, produced animals and plants. This marriage of Heaven and Earth produc ed the Azes, Genii famous in the theology of the North. In the theology of the Phrygians and Lydi ans, the ASII were born of the marriage of the Supreme God with the Earth, and Firmicus informs us that the Phrygians attrihuted to the Earth supremacy over the other elements, and considered her the Great Mother of all things. Virgil sings the impregnation of th e joyous earth, by the Ether, its spouse, that descends upon its bosom, fertilizing it with rains. Columella sings the loves of Na ture and her marriage with Heaven annually consummated at the sweet Spring-time. He describes the Sp irit of Life, the soul that animates the world, fired with passion of Love, unitin g with Nature and itself, it self a part of Nature, and filling its own bosom with new productions. This uni on of the universe with itself, this mutual action of two sexes, he terms \"t he great Secrets of Nature,\" \"the Mysteries of the Union of Heaven with Earth, imaged in the Sacred My steries of Atys and Bacchus.\" Varro tells us that the great Di vinities adored at Samothrace were the Heavens and the Earth, considered as First Causes or Primal Gods, an d as male and female agents, one bearing to the other the relations that the Soul and Principle of Movement bear to the body or the matter that receives them. These were the gods revered in the Mysteries of that Island, as they were in the orgies of Phoenicia. Everywhere the sacred body of Nature was covered with the veil of allegory, which concealed it from the profane, and allowed it to be seen only by the sage who thought it worthy to be the object of his study and investigation. She showed herself to those only who loved her in spirit and in truth, and she abandoned the indifferent and careless to error and to ignorance. \"The Sages of Greece,\" says Pausanias, \"never wrote otherwise than in an eni gmatical manner, never nat urally and directly.\" \"Nature,\" says Sallust the Philosopher, \"should be su ng only in a language that imitates the secrecy of her processes and operations. She is herself an enigma. We see only bodies in movement; the forces and springs that move them are hidden fr om us.\" The poets inspired by the Divinity, the wisest philosophers, all the theologians, the chiefs of the initiations and Mysteries, even the gods uttering their oracles, have borrowed the figurati ve language of allegory. \"The Egyptians,\" says Proclus, \"preferred that mode of teaching, and spoke of the great secrets of Nature, only in mythological enigmas.\" The Gymnoso phists of India and the Druids of Gaul lent to science the same enigmatic language, and in the same st yle wrote the Hierophants of Phoenicia. The division of things into the active and the passi ve cause leads to that of the two Principles of Light and Darkness, connected with and correspond ing with it. For Light comes from the ethereal substance that composes the active cause, and darkness from earth or the gross matter which composes the passive cause. In Hesiod, the Eart h, by its union with Tartarus, engenders Typhon. Chief of the Powers or Genii of Darkness. Put it unites itself with the Ether or Ouranos, when it engenders the Gods of Olympus, or th e Stars, children of Starry Ouranos."},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"Light was the first Divinity worshippe d by men. To it they owed th e brilliant spectacl e of Nature. It seems an emanation from the Creator of all things , making known to our senses the Universe which darkness hides from our eyes, and, as it were givi ng it existence. Darkness, as it were, reduces all nature again to nothingness, and almost entirely annihilates man. Naturally, therefore, two substances of opposite na tures were imagined, to each of which the world was in turn subjected, one contributing to its felic ity and the other to its mi sfortune. Light multiplied its enjoyments; Darkness despoiled it of them: the former was its friend, the la tter its enemy. To one all good was attributed; to the other all evil; and thus the words \"Light\" and \"Good\" became synonymous, and the words \"Darkness\" and \"Evil. \" It seeming that Good and Evil could not flow from one and the same source, any more than c ould Light and Darkness, men naturally imagined two Causes or Principles, of different natures and opposite in their effects, one of which shed Light and Good, and the other Darkne ss and Evil, on the Universe. This distinction of the two Principles was admi tted in all the Theologies, and formed one of the principal bases of all religions. It entered as a primary element into the sacred fables, the cosmogonies and the Mysteries of antiquity. \"We are not to suppose,\" says Plutarch, \"that the Principles of the Universe are inanimate bodies, as Democritus and Epicurus thought; nor that a matter devoid of qualities is organized and arrange d by a single Reason or Providence, Sovereign over all things, as the Stoics held; for it is not po ssible that a single Being, g ood or evil, is the cause of all inasmuch as God can in nowise be the caus e of any evil. The harmony of the Universe is a combination of contraries, like the strings of a lyre, or that of a bow, which alternately is stretched and relaxed.\" \"The good,\" says Euripides, \"is neve r separated from the Evil. The two must mingle, that all may go well.\" And this opin ion as to the two principles, cont inues Plutarch, \"is that of all antiquity. From the Theologians an d Legislators it passed to the Po ets and Philosophers. Its author is unknown; but the opinion itself is established by the traditio ns of the whole human race, and consecrated in the mysteries and sacrifices both of the Greeks and Barbarians, wherein was recognized the dogma of opposing principles in na ture, which, by their contrariety, produce the mixture of good and evil. We must admit two contra ry causes, two opposing powers, which lead, one to the right and the other to the lef t, and thus control our life, as they do the sublunary world, which is therefore subject to so many changes and irregularit ies of every kind. For if there can be no effect without a cause, and if the G ood cannot be the cause of the Evil, it is absolut ely necessary that there should be a cause for the Evil, as there is one for the Good.\" This doctrine, he adds, has been generally received among most nations, and espec ially by those who have had the greatest reputation for wisdom. All have admitted two gods , with different occupations, one making the good and the other the evil found in nature. The former has been styled \"God,\" the latter \"Demon.\" The Persians, or Zoroaster, named the former Ormuzd and the latter Ahriman; of whom they said one was of the nature of Light, the other of that of Darkness. The Egyptians called the former Osiris, and the latter Typhon, his eternal enemy. The Hebrews, at least after their return from the Persian captivity, had their good Deity, and the Devil, a bad and malicious Spirit, ever opposing Go d, and Chief of the Angels of Darkness, as God was of those of Light. The word \"Satan\" means, in Hebrew, simply, \"The Adversary.\" The Chaldeans, Plutarch says, had their good and evil stars. The Greeks had their Jupiter and Pluto, and their Giants and Titans, to whom were assigned the attributes of the Serpent with which Pluto or Serapis was encircled, and the shape whereof was assumed by Typhon, Ahriman, and the Satan of the Hebrews. Every people had something equivalent to this. The People of Pegu believe in two Principles, one author of Good and the other of Evil, and strive to propitiate the latter, while they think it needless to worship th e former, as he is incapable of doing evil. The people of Java, of the Mo luccas, of the Gold Coast, the Ho ttentots, the peopl e of Teneriffe and Madagascar, and the Savage Tribes of America, all worship and strive to avert the anger and propitiate the good-will of the Evil Spirit. But among the Greeks, Egyptians, Chaldeans, Pe rsians, and Assyrians, the doctrine of the two Principles formed a complete and regularly arrange d theological system. It was the basis of the religion of the Magi and of Egypt. The author of an ancient work, attributed to Origen, says that"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"Pythagoras learned from Zarastha, a Magus at Babylon (the same, perhaps, as Zerdusht or Zoroaster), that there are two principles of all things, whereof one is the father and the other the mother; the former, Light, and the latter, Dark ness. Pythagoras thought that the Dependencies on Light were warmth, dryness, lightness, swiftnes s; and those on Darkness, cold, wet, weight, and slowness; and that the world derived its existence from these two principles, as from the male and the female. According to Porphyry, he conceived two opposing powers, one good, which he termed Unity, the Light, Right, the Equa l, the Stable, the Straight; the ot her evil, which he termed Binary, Darkness, the Left, the Unequal, the Crooked. Thes e ideas he received from the Orientals, for he dwelt twelve years at Babylon, st udying with the Magi. Varro says he recognized two Principles of all things, - the Finite and the Infinite, Good and Evil, Life and Death, Day a Night. White he thought was of the nature of the Good Principle, and Black of that of the Evil; that Light and Darkness, Heat and Cold, the Dry and the Wet, mingled in equal proportions; that Summer was the triumph of heat, and Winter of cold; that their equal combinati on produced Spring and Autumn, the former producing verdure and favorable to health, and the latter, deter iorating everything, giving birth to maladies. He applied the same idea to the rising and setting of th e sun; and, like the Ma gi, held that God or Ormuzd in the body resembled light, and in the soul, truth . Aristotle, like Plato, admitted a pr inciple of Evil, resident in matter and in its eternal imperfection. The Persians said that Ormuzd, born of the pure Li ght, and Ahriman, born of darkness, were ever at war. Ormuzd produced six Gods , Beneficence, Truth, Good Or der, Wisdom, Riches, and Virtuous Joy. These were so many emanations from the Good Principle, so many blessi ngs bestowed by it on men. Ahriman, in his turn, produced six Devs, opp onents of the six emanations from Ormuzd. Then Ormuzd made himself three times as great as before, ascended as far above the sun as the sun is above the earth, and adorned the heavens with star s, of which he made Sirius the sentinel or advance-guard: that he then created twenty-four other Deities, and placed them in an egg, where Ahriman also placed twenty-four others, created by him, who broke the egg, and so intermingled Good and Evil. Theopompus adds that, according to the Magi, for two terms of three thousand years, each of the two Principles is to be by turns victor and the other vanquished; then for three thousand more for each they are to contend with ea ch other, each destroying reciprocally the works of the other; after which Ahriman is to perish , and men, wearing transparent bodies, to enjoy unutterable happiness. The twelve great Deities of the Persians, the si x Amshaspands and six Devs, marshalled, the former under the banner of Light, and the latter under that of Darkness, are the twelve Zodiacal Signs or Months; the six supreme signs, or those of Light, or of Spring and Summer, commencing with Aries, and the six inferior, of Darkness, or of Autumn and Winter, commencing with Libra. Limited Time, as contradistinguished from Time without limits, or Eternity, is Time created and measured by the celestial revolutions. It is comprehended in a period divided into twelve parts, each subdivided into a thousand parts, which the Persians termed years. Thus the circle annually traversed by the Sun was divided into 12,000 parts, or each sign into 3,000: and thus, each year, the Principle of Light and Good triumphed for 3,000 years, that of Evil and Darkness for 3,000, and th ey mutually destroyed each other's labors for 6,000, or 3,000 for each : so that the Zodiac was equally divided between them. And accordingly Ocellus Lucanus, the Disciple of Pythagoras, held that the principal cause of all sublunary effects resided in the Zodiac, and that from it flowed the good or bad influences of the planets that revolved therein. The twenty-four good and twenty-four evil Deities, enclosed in the Egg, are the forty-eight constellations of the ancient sphere, equally divi ded between the realms of Light and Darkness, on the concavity of the celestial s phere which was apportioned among them; and which, enclosing the world and planets, was the mystic and sacred egg of the Magi, the Indians, and the Egyptians,-- the egg that issued from the mouth of the God Kneph, that figured as t he Orphic Egg in the Mysteries of Greece, that issued from the God Chumong of the Coresians, and from the Egyptian Osiris and the God Phanes of the Modern Orphics, Principle of Light,--the egg cr ushed by the Sacred Bull of the Japanese, and from which the world emerged; that pl aced by the Greeks at the feet of Bacchus the bull-horned God, and from which Aristophanes makes Love emerge, who with Night organizes Chaos. Thus the Balance, the Sc orpion, the Serpent of O phiucus, ar the Dragon of the Hesperides became"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"malevolent Signs and Evil Genii; and entire natur e was divided between the two principles, and between the agents or partial c auses subordinate to them. Hence Michael and his Archangels, and Satan and his fallen compeers. Henc e the wars of Jupiter and the Giants, in which th Gods of Olympus fought on the side of th e Light-God, agains the dark progeny of earth and Chaos; a war which Proclus regarded as symbolizing the resistan ce opposed by dark and chaotic matter to the active and beneficent force which gives it organiz ation; an idea which in part appears in the old theory of two Principles, one innate in the active and luminous substance of Heaven, and the other in the inert and dark substance of matter th at resists the order and the good that Heaven communicates to it. Osiris conquers Typhon, and Ormuzd , Ahriman, when, at the Vernal Equinox, the creative action of Heaven and its demiourgic energy is most strongly manifested. Then the principle of Light and Good overcomes that of Darkness and Evil, and the world rejoices, redeemed from cold and wintry darkness by the beneficent Sign in to which the Sun then enters tr iumphant and rejoicing, after his resurrection. From the doctrine of the two Princi ples, Active and Passive grew that of the Universe, animated by a Principle of Eternal Life, and by a Universal Soul , from which every isolated and temporary being received at its birth an emanation, which, at the death of such being, returned to its source. The life of matter as much belonged to nature as did matt er itself; and as life is manifested by movement, the sources of life must needs seem to be placed in those luminous and et ernal bodies, and above all in the Heaven in which they revolve, and which whirls them al ong with itself in that rapid course that is swifter than all other movement. And fire and heat have so great an anal ogy with life, that cold like absence of movement, seemed the distinctive char acteristic of death. Accordingly, the vital fire that blazes in the Sun and produces the heat that vivifies everything, was regarded as the principle of organization and life of all sublunary beings. According to this doctrine, the Universe is not to be regarded in its creative and eternal action, merely as an immense machine moved by powerful springs and forced into a continual movement which, emanating from the circumfe rence, extends to the centre acts and re-acts in every possible direction, and re-produces in succe ssion all the varied forms which ma tter receives. So to regard it would be to recognize a cold and purely mechanical action, the energy of which could never produce life. On the contrary, it was thought, the Universe sh ould be deemed an immense Being, always living, always moved and always moving in an eternal activity inherent in itself, and which, subordinate to no foreign cause, is communicated to all its parts , connects them together, and makes of the world of things a complete and perfect whole. The order and harmony which reign therein seem to belong to and be a part of it, and the des ign of the various plan s of construction of organized beings would seem to be graven in its Supr eme Intelligence, source of all the other Intellig ences which it communicates together with life to man. Nothing exis ting out of it, it must be regarded as the principle and term of all things. Chaeremon had no reason for saying that the Ancient Egyptians, inventors of the sacred fables, and adorers of the Sun and the other luminaries, saw in the Universe only a machine, without life and without intelligence, either in its whole or in it s parts; and that thei r cosmogony was a pure Epicureanism, which required only matter and mo vement to organize its world and govern it. Such an opinion would necessarily exclude all religious worship. Wherever we suppose a worship, there we must suppose intelligen t Deities who receive it, and are sensib le to the homage of their adorers; and no other people were so religious as the Egyptians. On the contrary, with them the immense, immut able, and Eternal Being, termed \"God\" or \"the Universe,\" had eminently, and in all their plenit ude, that life and intelligence which sublunary beings, each an infinitely small and temporary portion of itse lf, possess in a far inferior degree and infinitely less quantity. It was to them, in some sort, like the Ocean, whence the springs, brooks, and rivers have risen by evaporation, and to the bosom whereof they return by a longer or shorter course, and after a longer or shorter separation from the immense mass of its waters.

The unit is the symbol of ident ity, equality, existence, conserva tion and general harmony; the Central Fire, the Point within the Circle. Two, or the duad, is the symbol of diversity, inequality, division, separ ation, and vicissitudes. The figure 1 signifies the living man [a body sta nding upright] man being the only living being possessed of this faculty. Adding to it a head, we have the letter P, the sign of Paternity, Creative Power; and with a further addition, R, sign ifying man in motion, going, Iens, Iturus. The Duad is the origin of contrasts. It is the imperfect condition into which, according to the Pythagoreans, a being falls, when he detaches hims elf from the Monad, or God. Spiritual beings, emanating from God, are enveloped in the duad, and therefore rece ive only illusory impressions. As formerly the number ONE designated harmony, or der, or the Good Principle (the ONE and ONLY GOD, expressed in Latin Solus, whence the words Sol, Soleil, symbol of this God), the number Two expressed the contrary idea. T here commenced the fatal knowledg e of good and evil. Everything double, false opposed to the single and sole re ality, was expressed by the Binary number. It expressed also that state of cont rariety in which nature exists, where everything is double; night and day, light and darkness, cold and heat, wet and dr y, health and sickness, error and truth, one and the other sex, etc. Hence the Romans dedicated the second month in the year to Pluto, the God of Hell, and the second day of that month to the manes of the dead. The number One, with the Chinese, signified unity, harmony order, t he Good Principle, or God; Two, disorder, duplicity, falsehood. That people, in the earliest ages, based their whole philosophical system on the two primary figures or lines, one straight and unbroken, and the other broken or divided into two; doubling which, by placing on e under the other, and trebli ng by placing three under each other, they made the four sy mbols and eight Koua; which referr ed to the natural elements, and the primary principles of all things, and served symb olically or scientifically to express them. Plato terms unity and duality the original elements of natu re, and first principles of all existence: and the oldest sacred book of the Chinese says: \"The Gr eat First Principle has produced two equations and differences, or primary rules of existence; but t he two primary rules or two oppositions, namely YN"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"and YANG, or repose and motion, have produced four signs symbols, and the four symbols have produced the eight KOUA or further combinations.\" The interpretation of the Hermetic fables shows, among every ancient people, in their principal gods, first, 1, the Creating Monad, then 3, then 3 times 3, 3 times 9, and 3 times 27. This triple progression has for its foundation the three ages of Nature, the Past, the Present, and the Future; or the three degrees of universal generation. . . Birth, Life, Death. . . Beginning, middle, end. The Monad was male, because its action produces no change in itself, but only out of itself. It represented the creative principle. The Duad, for a contrary reason, was female, ever changing by additi on, subtraction, or multiplication. It represents matter capable of form. The union of the Monad and Duad produces the Tria d, signifying the world formed by the creative principle out of matter. Pythagoras represented th e world by the right-angled triangle, in which the squares of the two shortest side s are equal, added together, to the s quare of the longest one; as the world, as formed, is equal to the clea tive cause, and matter clothed with form. The ternary is the first of the unequal numbers. Th e Triad, mysterious number, which plays so great a part in the traditions of Asia and the philosophy of Plato, image of the Su preme Being, includes in itself the properties of the firs t two numbers. It was, to the Phil osophers, the most excellent and favorite number: a mysterious type, revered by all antiquity, and consecra ted in the Mysteries; wherefore there are but three essential Degrees am ong Masons; who venerate, in the triangle, the most august mystery, that of the Sacred Triad, object of their homage and study. In geometry, a line cannot represent a body absolut ely perfect. As little do two lines constitute a figure demonstratively perfect. But three lines fo rm, by their junction, the TRIANGLE, or the first figure regularly perfect; and this is why it has served and still serves to char acterize The Eternal; Who, infinitely perfect in His nature, is, as Univ ersal Creator, the first Be ing, and consequently the first Perfection. The Quadrangle or Square, perfect as it appears, being but the seco nd perfection, can in no wise represent God; Who is the first. It is to be noted that the name of God in Latin and French (Deus, Dieu), has for its initial the Delta or Greek Tr iangle. Such is the reason, among ancients and moderns, for the consecration of tne Triangle, whose three sides are emblems of the three Kingdoms, or Nature, or God. In the centre is t he Hebrew JOD, the Animating Spirit of Fire, the generative principle, represented by the letter G., initial of the name of Deit y in the languages of the North, and the meaning whereof is Generation. The first side of the Triangle, of fered to the study of the Appr entice, is the mineral kingdom, symbolized by Tub.'. The second side, the subject of the meditations of the Fellow Cr aft, is the vegetable kingdom, symbolized by Schib.'. (an ear of corn). In this re ign begins the Generation of bodies; and this is why the letter G., in its radiance, is presented to the ey es of the adept. The third side, the study whereof is devoted to t he animal kingdom, and completes the instruction of the Master, is symbolized by Mach.'. (Son of putrefaction). The figure 3 symbolizes the Earth. It is a figure of the terrestrial bodies. The 2, upper half of 3, symbolizes the vegetable world, the lo wer half being hidden from our sight. Three also referred to harmony, friendship, peac e, concord, and temperance; and was so highly esteemed among the Pythagoreans that they called it perfect harmony."},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"Three, four, ten, and twelve were sacred numbers among the Etrurians, as they were among the Jews, Egyptians, and Hindus. The name of Deity, in many Nations, consisted of three letters among the Greeks,I.'.A.'. Q.'.; among the Persians, H.'.O.'.M.'. among the Hindus, AUM; among the Scandi navians, I.'.O.'.W.'. On the upright Tablet of the King, discovered at Nimroud, no less than five of the thirteen names of the Great Gods consist of three letters each,--ANU, SAN, YAV, BAR, and BEI,. The quaternary is the most perfect number, and the root of other numbers, and of all things. The tetrad expresses the first mathematical power. F our represents also the generative power, from which all combinations are derived. The Initiates considered it the emblem of Movement and the Infinite, representing everything that is neither corporeal nor sensible. Pythagoras communicated it to his disciples as a symbol of the Eternal and Crea tive Principle, under the name of Quaternary, the Ineffable Name of God, which signi fies Source of everything that has received existence; and which, in Hebrew, is composed of four letters. In the Quaternary we find the first solid figure, th e universal symbol of immort ality, the pyramid. The Gnostics claimed that the whole edifice of their sci ence rested on a square whose angles were . . . Silence: Profundity: Intelligence; and Truth. For if the Triangle, figured by the number 3, forms the triangular base of the pyramid, it is unity which forms its point or summit. Lysias and Timaeus of Locria said that not a si ngle thing could be named, which did not depend on the quaternary as its root. There is, according to the Pythagoreans, a c onnection between the gods and numbers, which constitutes the kind of Divination called Arithmomancy. The soul is a number: it is moved of itself: it contains in itself the quaternary number. Matter being represented by the number 9, or 3 times 3, and the Immortal Spirit having for its essential hieroglyphic the quaternary or the number 4, the Sages said that Man, having gone astray and become entangled in an inextricab le labyrinth, in going from four to nine, the only way which he could take to emerge from these deceitful paths, these disastrous detours, an d the abyss of evil into which he had plunged, was to retrace his steps, and go from nine to four. The ingenious and mystical idea which caused the Triangle to be venerated, was applied to the figure 4 (4). It was said that it expressed a living being, I, bearer of the Triangle, the emblem of God; i. e., man bearing with himself a Divine principle. Four was a divine number; it referred to the Deit y, and many Ancient Nati ons gave God a name of four letters; as the Hebrews, the Egyptians AMUN , the Persians SURA, the Greeks, and the Latins DEUS. This was the Tetragrammaton of the Hebrews, and the Pythagoreans called it Tetractys, and swore their most solemn oath by it. So too ODIN among th e Scandinavians, ZEYS among the Greeks, PHTA among the Egyptians, THOTH among the Phoenicians, and AS-UR and NEBO among the Assyrians. The list might be indefinitely extended. The number 5 was considered as mysterious, becau se it was compounded of the Binary, Symbol of the False and Double, and the Ternary, so interesti ng in its results. It thus energetically expresses the state of imperfection, of order and disorder, of happiness an d misfortune, of lif e and death, which we see upon the earth. To the Mysterious Societies it offered the fearful image of the Bad Principle, bringing trouble into the inferior order,--in a word, the Binary acting in the Ternary. Under another aspect it was the emblem of marria ge; because it is compos ed of 2, the first equal number, and of 3, the first unequal number. Wheref ore Juno, the Goddess of Marriage, had for her"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"hieroglyphic the nwnber 5. Moreover, it has one of the properties of the number 9, that of reproducing itself, when multiplied by itself: there being always a 5 on the right hand of the product; a re sult which led to its use as a symbol of material changes. The ancients represented the world by the number 5. A reason for it, given by Diodorus, is, that it represents earth, water, a fire, and ether or spirit. T hence the origin of (5) and the Universe, as the whole. The number 5 designated the universal quintessence, and Symbolized, by its form the vital essence, the animating spir it which flows [serpentat] through all natur e. In fact, this ingenious figure is the union of the two Greek accents '', placed over thos e vowels which ought to be or ought not to be aspirated. The first sign ' bears the name of potent spirit; and signifies the S uperior Spirit, the Spirit of God aspirated (spiratus), respired by man. T he second sign ' is styled mild spirit, and represents the secondary spirit, th e spirit purely human. The triple triangle, a figure of five lines unitin g in five points, was among the Pythagoreans an emblem of Health. It is the Pentalpha of Pythagoras, or Pentangle of Solomon; has five lines and five angles; and is, among Masons, the outline or origin of the five -pointed Star, and an emblem of Fellowship. The number 6 was, in the Ancient Mysteries, a st riking emblem of nature; as presenting the six dimensions of all bodies: the six lines which make up their form, viz., the four lines of direction, toward the North, South, East, and West; with the two lines of he ight and depth, responding to the zenith and nadir. The sages applied the senary to the physical man; while the septenary was, for them, the symbol of his immortal spirit. The hieroglyphical senary (the double equilateral triangle) the symbol of Deity. Six is also an emblem of health, and the symbol of ju stic; because it is the fi rst perfect number; that is, the first whose aliquot parts (1/2, 1/3, 1/6, or 3, 2, and 1), added together, make itself. Ormuzd created six good spirits, and Ahriman six evil ones. These ty pify the six Summer and the six Winter months. No number has ever been so universally in repute as the septenary. Its celebrity is due, no doubt, to the planets being seven in number. It belongs al so to sacred things. The Pythagoreans regarded it as formed of the numbers 3 and 4; the first wher eof was, in their eyes, the image of the three material elements, and the second the principle of ev erything that is neither corporeal nor sensible. It presented them, from that point of view, th e emblem of everything that is perfect. Considered as composed of 6 and unity, it serves to designate the invisible centre or soul of everything; because no body exists , of which six lines do not cons titute the form, nor without a seventh interior point, as the centre and reality of the body, whereof the external dimensions give only the appearance. The numerous applications of t he septenary confirmed the ancient sages in the use of this symbol. Moreover, they exalted the properties of the num ber 7, as having, in a subordinate manner, the perfection of the unit: for if the unit is uncreated, if no number produces it, the seven is also not engendered by any number contained in the interval between 1 and 10. The number 4 occupies an arithmetical middle-ground between the unit and 7, inasmuch as it is as much over 1, as it is under 7, the difference each way being 3. The number 7, among the Egyptians, symbolized life; a nd this is why the letter Z of the Greeks was"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"the initial of the verb I live; and Jupiter, Father of Life. The number 8, or the octary, is composed of th e sacred numbers 3 and 5. Of the heavens, of the seven planets, and of the sphere of the fixed stars, or of the eternal unity and the mysterious number 7, is composed the ogdoade, the number 8, the fi rst cube of equal numbers, regarded as sacred in the arithmetical philosophy. The Gnostic ogdoade had eight stars, which represen ted the eight Cabiri of Samothrace, the eight Egyptian and Phoenician principles, the eight gods of Xenocrates, the eigh t angles of the cubic stone. The number eight symbolizes perfect ion: and its figure, 8 or (infinity) indicates the perpetual and regular course of the Universe. It is the first cube (2 X 2 X 2), and signifies fr iendship prudence, counsel , and justice. It was a symbol of the primeval law which regarded all men as equal. The novary, or triple ternary. If the number three was celebrated am ong the ancient sages, that of three times three had no less celebrity; because, according to them, each of the three elements which constitute our bodies is ternary: the wate r containing earth and fire; the earth containing igneous and aqueous particles; and the fire bein g tempered by globules of water terrestrial corpuscles which serve to feed it. No one of the three elements being entirely separated from the others, all material beings composed of these th ree elements, whereof each is triple, may be designated by the figurative number of three time s three, which has become the symbol of all formations of bodies. Hence the name of ninth envelope, given to ma tter. Every materi al extension, every circular line, has for representative sign the number nine, among th e Pythagoreans; who had observed the property which this number possesses , of reproducing itself incessantly and entire, in every multiplication; thus offering to the mind a ve ry striking emblem of matt er which is incessantly composed before our eyes, after having undergone a thousand decompositions. The number nine was consecrated to the Sphere s and the Muses. It is the sign of every circumference; because a circle of 360 degrees is equal to 9, that is to say, 3 + 6 + 0 = 9. Nevertheless, the ancients regarded this number with a sort of terror: they considered it a bad presage; as the symbol of versatility, of change and the emblem of the fr ailty of human affairs. Wherefore they avoided all numbers where nine a ppears, and chiefly 81, the product of 9 multiplied by itself, and the addition whereof, 8 + 1, again presents the number 9. As the figure of the number 6 was the symbol of t he terrestrial globe, animated by a divine spirit, the figure of the number 9 symbolized the earth, under the influence of the Evil Principle thence the terror it inspired. Nevertheless, according to Kaba lists, the figure 9 symbolizes the generative egg, or the image of a little globular being, from whose lower side seems to flow its spirit of life. The Ennead, signifying an aggregate of 9 things or persons, is the first s quare of unequal numbers. Every one is aware of the singular pr operties of the number 9, which, mu ltiplied by itself or any other number whatever, gives a result whose final su m is always 9, or always divisible by 9. Nine, multiplied by each of the ordinary number s, produces an arithmetic al progression, each member whereof, composed of two figures, presents a remarkable fact; for example: 1...2...3...4...5...6 ...7...8...9..10 9..18..27..36..45..54..63..72..81..90 The first line of figures gives the regular series, from 1 to 10."},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"The second reproduces this line doubly; first ascendi ng, from the first figure of 18, and then returning from the second figure of 81.

Containing all the numerical and harmonic relati ons, and all the properties of numbers which precede it, it concludes the Abacus or Table Pythagoras. To the Mysterious Societies, this number typified the assemblage of all the wonders of the Univer se. They wrote it thus (theta), that is to say, Unity in the middle of Zero, as t he centre of a circle, or symbol of Deity. They saw in this figure everything that should lead to refl ection: the centre, the ray, and the circumference, represented to them God, Man, and the Universe. This number was, among the Sages , a sign of concord, love, and peac e. To Masons it is a sign of union and good faith; because it is expressed by joining two hands, or the Master's grip, when the number of fingers gives 10: and it was re presented by the Tetractys of Pythagoras. The number 12, like the number 7, is celebrated in the worship of nature. The two most famous divisions of the heavens, that by 7, which is that of the planets, and that by 12, which is that of the Signs of the Zodiac, are found upon the religious monu ments of all the peoples of the Ancient World, even to the remote extremes of the East. Alth ough Pythagoras does not speak the number 12, it is none the less a sacred number. It is image of the Zodiac; and consequently th at of the Sun, which rules over it. Such are the ancient ideas in regard to those numb ers which so often appear in Masonry; and rightly understood, as the old Sages understood them, they contain many a pregnant lesson. Before we enter u pon the final lesson of Mas onic Philosophy, we will delay a few moments to repeat to you the Christian interpre tations of the Blue Degrees. In the First Degree, they said, there are three symbols to be applied. 1st. Man, after the fall, was left naked and defenceless against the just anger of the Deity. Prone to evil, the human race staggered blindly onward into the thick darkness of unb elief, bound fast by the strong cable-tow of the natural a nd sinful will. Moral co rruption was followed by physical misery. Want and destitution in vaded the earth. War and Famine and Pestilence f illed up the measure of evil, and over the sharp flints of misfortune and wretchedness man toiled with naked and bleeding feet. This condition of blindness, destitution, misery, and bondage, from which to save the world the Redeemer came, is symbolized by the condition of the candidate, when he is brought up for the first time to the door of the Lodge."},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"2d. Notwithstanding the death of the Redeemer, man can be saved only by faith, repentance, and reformation. To repent, he must feel the shar p sting of conscience and remorse, like a sword piercing his bosom. His confidence in his guide, w hom he is told to follow and fear no danger; his trust in God, which he is caused to profess; and the point of the sword that is pressed against his naked left breast over the heart, are symbolical of the faith, repentance and reformation necessary to bring him to the light of a life in Christ the Crucified. 3d. Having repented and reformed, and bound himself to the service of God by a firm promise and obligation, the light of Christian hope shines do wn into the darkness of the heart of the humble penitent, and blazes upon his pathway to Heaven. And this is symbolized by the candidate's being brought to light, after he is obligated, by the Wors hipful Master, who in t hat is a symbol of the Redeemer, and so brings him to light, with the help of the brethren, as He taught the Word with the aid of the Apostles. In the Second Degree there are two symbols: 4th. The Christian assumes new duties toward God and his fellows. Toward God, of love, gratitude, and veneration, and an anxious des ire to serve and glorify Him; to ward his fellows, of kindness, sympathy, and justice. And this assumption of duty this entering upon good works, is symbolized by the Fellow-Craft's obligation; by which, bound as an apprentice to secrecy merely, and set in the Northeast corner of the Lodge, he descends as a Fellow-Craft into the body of the brethren, and assumes the active duties of a good Mason. 5th. The Christian, reconciled to God, sees the worl d in a new light. This great Universe is no longer a mere machine, wou nd up and set go ing six thousand or sixty millions years ago, and left to run on afterward forever, by virtue of a law of mechanics created at the beginning, without further care or consideration on the part of the Deity; but it has now become to him a great emanation from God, the product of His thought, not a mere dead machi ne, but a thing of life, over which God watches continually, and every movement of which is immedi ately produced by His present action, the law of harmony being the essence of the Deity, re-enacted every instant. An d this is symbolized by the imperfect instruction given in th e Fellow-Craft's Degree, in the sciences, and particularly geometry, connected as the latter is with God Himself in the mind of a Mason, because the same letter, suspended in the East, represents both; and astrono my, or the knowledge of the laws of motion and harmony that govern the spheres, is but a portion of the wider science of geometry. It is so symbolized, because it is here, in the Second Degree, that the candidat e first receives an other than moral instruction. There are also two symbols in the Third Degree, wh ich, with the 3 in the first, and 2 in the second, make the 7. 6th. The candidate, after passing through the first part of the ceremony, imag ines himself a Master; and is surprised to be informed that as yet he is not, and that it is uncertain whether he ever will be. He is told of a difficult and dangerous path yet to be travelled, and is advised that upon that journey it depends whether he will become a Master. This is symbolical of that whic h our Saviour said to Nicodemus, that, notwithstanding his morals mi ght be beyond reproach, he could not enter the Kingdom of Heaven unless he were born again; symbolically dyi ng, and again entering the world regenerate, like a spotless infant. 7th. The murder of Hiram, his burial, and his bei ng raised again by the Mast er, are symbols, both of the death, burial, and resurrection of the Redeemer; and of the death and burial in sins of the natural man, and his being raised again to a new life, or born again, by the direct action of the Redeemer; after Morality (symbolized by the Entered Apprentice's grip), and Philosophy (symbolized by the grip of the Fellow-Craft), had failed to ra ise him. That of the Lion of the Ho use of Judah is the strong grip, never to be broken, with which Christ, of the royal line of that House, has clasped to Himself the whole human race, and embraces them in His wide arms as closely and affectionately as brethren embrace each other on the fi ve points of fellowship. As Entered Apprentices and Fellow-Crafts, Masons are taught to imitate the laudable example of"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"those Masons who labored at the building of King Solomon's Temple; and to plant firmly and deep in their hearts those foundation-stones of principle, truth, justice, te mperance, fortitude, prudence, and charity, on which to erect that Christian character which all the storms of misfortune and all the powers and temptations of Hell shall not prevail aga inst; those feelings and noble affections which are the most proper homage that can be paid to the Grand Architect and Great Father of the Universe, and which make the heart a living temple builded to Him: when the unruly passions are made to submit to rule and measurement, and thei r excesses are struck off with the gavel of self- restraint; and when every action and every princi ple is accurately corrected and adjusted by the square of wisdom, the level of humility, and the plumb of justice. The two columns, Jachin and Boaz, are the symbols of that profound faith and implicit trust in God and the Redeemer that are the Christian's strength ; and of those good works by which alone that faith can be established and made ope rative and effectual to salvation. The three pillars that su pport the Lodge are symbols of a Christian's HOPE in a future state of happiness; FAITH in the promis es and the divine character and mission of the Redeemer; and CHARITABLE JUDGMENT of other men. The three murderers of Khir-Om symbolize Pontiu s Pilate, Caiaphas the High-Priest, and Judas Iscariot: and the three blows given him are the betray al by the last, the refusal of Roman protection by Pilate, and the condemnation by the High-Priest. They also symbolize the blow on the ear, the scourging, and the crown of thorns . The twelve fellow-crafts sent in search of the body are the twelve disciples, in doubt whether to believe that the Redeemer would rise from the dead. The Master's word, supposed to be lost, symboliz es the Christian faith and religion, supposed to have been crushed and destroyed when the Saviour wa s crucified, after Isca riot had betrayed Him, and Peter deserted Him, and when the other disc iples doubted whether He would arise from the dead; but which rose from His tomb and flowed rapi dly over the civilized world; and so that which was supposed to be lost was found. It symbolizes al so the Saviour Himself; the WORD that was in the beginning--that was with God, and that was God; the Word of life, that was made flesh and dwelt among us, and was supposed to be lost, while He lay in the tomb, for three days, and His disciples \"as yet knew not the scripture that He must rise again from the dead,\" a nd doubted when they heard of it, and were amazed and frightened and st ill doubted when He app eared among them. The bush of acacia placed at th e head of the grave of Khir-Om is an emblem of resurrection and immortality. Such are the explanations of ou r Christian brethren; entitled, like those of all other Masons, to a respectful consideration. CLOSING INSTRUCTION. There is no pretence to infallibility in Masonry. It is not for us to dictate to any ma n what he shall believe. We have hitherto, in the instruction of the several Degrees, confined ourselves to aying before you the great thoughts that have found expres sion in the different ages of the world, leaving you to decide for yourself as to the orthodoxy or he terodoxy of each, and what proportion of truth, if any, each contained. We shall pursue no other cour se in this closing Philoso phical instruction; in which we propose to deal with the highest questi ons that have ever exercised the human mind,--with the existence and the nature of a God, with the ex istence and the natnre of the human soul, and with the relations of the divine and human spirit with the merely material Universe. There can be no questions more important to an in telligent being, none that have fo r him a more direct and personal interest; and to this last word of Scottish Masonry we invite your serious an d attentive c onsideration. And, as what we shall now say will be but the co mpletion and rounding-off of what we have already said in several of the preceding Degrees, in re gard to the Old Thought and the Ancient Philosophies,"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"we hope that you have noted and not forgotten our pr evious lessons, without which this would seem imperfect and fragmentary. In its idea of rewarding a faithf ul and intelligent workman by conf erring upon him a knowledge of the True Word, Masonry has perpetuated a very great trut h, because it involves the proposition that the idea which a man forms of God is always the most im portant element in his sp eculative theory of the Universe, and in his particular practical plan of action for the Church, the State, the community, the Family, and his own individual life. It will ever make a vast difference in the conduct of a people in war or peace, whether they believe the Supreme Go d to be a cruel Deity, delighting in sacrifice and blood, or a God of Love; and an indi vidual's speculative theory as to the mode and extent of God's govermnent, and as to the nature and reality of his own free-will and consequent responsibility, will needs; have great influence in shaping the course of his life and conversation. We see every day the vast influence of the popular id ea of God. All the great hi storical civilizations of the race have grown out of the national ideas which were formed of God; or have been intimately connected with those ideas. The p opular Theology, which at first is only an abstract idea in the heads of philosophers, by and by shows itself in the laws, and in the punishments for crime, in the churches, the ceremonies and the sacraments, th e festivals and the fast s, the weddings, the baptisms and the funerals, in the hospitals, the college s, the schools, and all the social charities, in the relations of husband and wife, parent and child, in the daily work and the daily prayer of every man. As the world grows in its development, it necessari ly outgrows its ancient id eas of God, which were only temporary and provisional. A man who has a hi gher conception of God than those about him, and who denies that their conception is God, is very likely to be called an Atheist by men who are really far less believers in a God than he. Thus the Christians, who said the Heathen idols were no Gods, were accounted Atheist s by the People, and accordingly put to death; and Jesus of Nazareth was crucified as an unbelieving blasphemer, by the Jews. There is a mere formal Atheism, which is a denial of God in terms, but not in reality. A man says, There is no God; that is, no God that is self-originated, or that never originated, but always WAS and HAD BEEN, who is the cause of existence, who is the Mind and the Providenc e of the Universe; and so the order, beauty, and harmony of the world of matter and mind do not indicate any plan or purpose of Deity. But, he says, NATURE,-- meaning by that the whole sum-tota l of existence,-- that is powerful, active, wise, and good; Nature is self -originated, or always was and had been, the cause of its own existence, the mind of the Universe and the Providence of itself. There is obviously a plan and purpose whereby order, beauty, and harmony ar e brought about; but all that is the plan and purpose of nature. In such cases, the absolute denial of God is only formal and no t real. The qualities of God are admitted, and amrmed to be real; and it is a mere change of name to call the possessor of those qualities, Nature, and not God. The real question is, whether such Qualities exist, as we call God; and not, by what particular name we shall designate the Qualities. One man may call the sum total of these Qualities, Nature; another, Heaven; a third, Universe, a fourth , Matter; a fifth, Spirit; a sixth, God, Theos, Zeus, Alfadir, Allah, or what he pleas es. All admit the existence of the Being, Power, or ENS, thus diversely named. The name is of the smallest consequence. Real Atheism is the denial of the ex istence of any God, of the actualit y of all possible ideas of God. It denies that there any Mind, Intellig ence, or ENS, that is the Cause and Providence of the Universe, and of any Thing or any Existence, Soul, Spirit, or Being, that intentionally or intelligently produces the Order, Beauty, and Harmony thereof, and the cons tant and regular modes of operation therein. It must necessarily deny that there is any law, order, or harmony in existence, or any constant mode of operation in the world; for it is utterly impossible for any human cr eature to conceive, however much he may pretend to do so, of either of these, except as a consequence of the action of Intelligence; which is, indeed, that otherwise unknown thing, the existence of wh ich these alone prove; otherwise than as the cause of these, not a thing at all; a mere name for the wholly uncognizable cause of these."},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"The real atheist must deny the existe nce of the Qualities of God, deny that there is any mind of or in the Universe, any self-conscious Providence, any Prov idence at all. He must deny that there is any Being or Cause of Finite things, that is self-consc iously powerful, wise, jus t, loving, and faithful to itself and its own nature. He must deny that there is any plan in the Universe or any part of it. He must hold, either that matter is eternal, or that it originated itsel f, which is absurd, or that it was originated by an Intelligence, or at least by a C ause; and then he admits a God. No doubt it is beyond the reach of our faculties to imagine how matter originated,--how it began to be, in space where before was nothing, or God only. But it is equally beyond the reach of our faculties to imagine it eternal and unorigi nated. To hold it to be eter nal, without thought or will; t hat the specific forms of it, the seed, the rock, the tree, t he man, the solar system, all came with no forethought planning or producing them, by \"chance\" or \"the fortuitous concourse of atoms\" of matter that has no thought or will; and that they indicate no mind, no plan, no purp ose, no providence, is abs urd. It is not to deny the existence of what we underst and by mind, plan, purpose, Providence; but to insist that these words shall have some other meaning than that which the human race has ever attached to them: shall mean some unknown thing, for which the human race has no name, because it has of such a thing no possible idea. Either there never was any su ch thing as a \"plan,\" an d the word is nonsense, or the Universe exists in conformity to a plan. The word never meant, and never can mean, any other thing than that which the Universe exhibits . So with the word \"purpose;\" so with the word \"Providence.\" They mean nothing, or else only what the Universe proves. It was soon found that the denial of a Conscious Power, the cause of ma n and of his life, of a Providence, or a Mind and Intelligen ce arranging man in reference to the world, and the world in reference to man, would not satisf y the instinctive desires of human nature, or account for the facts of material nature. It did not long answer to say, if it ever was said , that the Universe was drifting in the void inane, and neither it, nor any mind within or without it, knew of its w hence, its whither, or its whereabouts; that man was drifting in the Universe, knowing little of his whereabouts, nothing of his whence or whither; that there was no Mind, no Prov idence, no Power, that kn ew any better; nothing that guided and directed man in his drifting, or the Universe in the weltering waste of Time. To say to man and woman, \"your heroism, your bravery, your self-denial all comes to nothing: your nobleness will do you no good you will die, and your nobleness will do mankind no service; for there is no plan or order in all these things; everything comes and goes by the fortuitous c oncourse of atoms ;\" did not, nor ever will, long satisfy the human mind. True, the theory of Atheism has been uttered. It has been said, \"Death is the end: this is a world without a God: you are a body without a soul: there is a Here, but no Hereafter for you; a Earth, but no Heaven. Die, and return to your dust. Man is bones, blood, bowels, and brain; mind is matter: there is no soul in the brain, nothing but nerves. We can see all the way to a little star in the nebula of Orion's belt; so distant that it will take light a thous and millions of years to come from it to thc earth, journeying at the rate of twelve millions of mile s a minute. There is no Heaven this side of that: you see all the way through: there is not a speck of Heaven; and do you think there is any beyond it; and if so, when would you reach it? There is no Pr ovidence. Nature is a fo rfuitous concourse of atoms; though is a fortuitous function of matter, a fortuitous result of a fo r tuitous result, a chance- shot from the great wind-gun of the Universe, accidentally loaded, pointed at random, and fired off by chance. Things happen; they are not arranged. Ther e is luck, and there is ill-luck; but there is no Providence. Die you into dust!\" Does all this satisf y the human instinct of i mmortality, that makes us ever long, with unutterable longing, to join our selves again to our dear ones who have gone away before us, an to mankind, for eternal life? Does it satisfy our mighty hungering and thirst for immortality, our anxious longing to come nearer to , and to know more of, the Eternal Cause of all things? Men never could be content to believe that there was no mind that thought for man, no conscience to enact eternal laws, no hear to love those whom nothing of earth loves or cares for, no will of the Universe to marshal the nations in the way of wisdom, just ic and love. History is not--thank God! we know it is not,--the fortuitous co ncourse of events, or Nature that of atoms. We can not believe that there is no plan nor purpose in Nature, to guid our going out and coming in: that there is a mighty going, but goes nowhere; that all beauty, wisdom, affe ction, justice, morality in the world, is an accident, and may end to-morrow. All over the world there is heroism unrequited, or paid with misery; vice on thrones, corruption in"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"high places, nobleness in poverty or even in ch ains, the gentle devotion of woman rewarded by brutal neglect or more brutal abuse and violen ce; everywhere want, misery, over-work, and under- wages. Add to these the Atheist's creed,--a body without a soul, an earth without Heaven, a world without a God; and what a Pandemoniu m would we make of this world ! The intellect of the Atheist woul d find matter everywhere; but no Causing and Providing Mind: his moral sense would find no Equitable Will, no Beauty of Moral Excellence, no Conscience enacting justice into the unchanging law of right, no spiritual Order or spiritual Providence, but only material Fate and Chance. His affections would find only fini te things to love; and to them the dead who were loved and who died yesterday, are like the rainbow t hat yesterday evening lived a moment and then passed away. His soul, flying through the vast I nane, and feeling the da rkness with its wings, seeking the Soul of all, which at once is Reason, Conscience, and the Heart of all that is, would find no God, but a universe all disorder; no Infinite, no Reason, no Conscience, no Heart, no Soul of things; nothing to reverence, to esteem, to love, to worship, to trust in; but only an Ugly Force, alien and foreign to us, that strikes down those we love, and makes us mere worms on the hot sand of the world. No voice would speak from the Earth to comfor t him. It is a cruel mother, that great Earth, that devours her young,--a Force and nothing more. Out of the sky would smile no kind Providence, in all its thousand starry eyes; and in storms a malignant violence, with its lightning-sword, would stab into the darkness, seeking for men to murder. No man ever was or ever can be content with that. The evidence of God has been ploughed into Nature so deeply, and so deeply woven into the te xture of the human soul, that Atheism has never become a faith, though it has sometimes assumed the shape of theory. Religion is natural to man. Instinctively he turns to God and reverences and relies on Him. In the Mathematics of the Heavens, written in gorgeous diagrams of fire, he sees la w, order, beauty, harmony without end: in the ethics of the little nations that inhabit the ant-hills he sees the same; in all Nature, animat e and inanimate, he sees the evidences of a Design, a Will, an Intelligence, and a God,--of a God benefic ent and loving as well as wise, and merciful and indulgent as well as powerful. To man, surrounded by the material Universe, and conscious of the influ ence that his material environments exercised upon his fortunes and his pres ent destiny;--to man, ever confronted with the splendors of the starry heavens, the regular marc h of the seasons, the phenomena of sunrise and moonrise, and all evidences of intelligence and design that everywhere presse upon and overwhelmed him, all imaginable questions as to the nature and cause of these phenomena constantly recurr ed, demanding to be solved, and refusing to be sent away unanswered. And still, after the lapse of ages, press upon the human mi n and demand solution, the same great questions-- perhaps still demandi ng it in vain. Advancing to the period when man had ceased to look upon the separate pa rts and individual forces of the Universe as gods; when he had come to look upon it as a whole, this question, among the earliest, occurred to him, and insisted on being answ ered: \"Is this material Universe self-existent, or was it created? Is eternal, or did it originate?\" And then in succession came crowding on the human mind t hese other questions: \"Is this material Universe a mere aggregate of fortui tous combinations of matter, or is it the result and work of intelligen acting upon a plan? \"If there be such an Inte lligence, what and where is it? Is mate rial Universe itse lf an Intelligent being? Is it like man, body and a soul ? Does Natu re act upon itself, or is there a Cause beyond it that acts upon it? \"If there is a personal God, separate from the ma terial Universe, that cr eated all things, Himself uncreated, is He corporeal or incorporeal, material or spiritual, the soul of the Universe or wholly apart from it? and if He be Spirit, what then is spirit?"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"\"Was that Supreme Deity active or quiescent before the creation; and if quiescent during a previous eternity, what necess of His nature moved Him at last to create a world; or was it a mere whim that had no motive? \"Was matter co-existent with Him, or absolutely created him out of nothing? Did He create it, or only mould and shape and fashion a chaos already existing, co-existent with Himself? \"Did the Deity directly create matte r, or was creation the work of in ferior deities, emanations from Himself? \"If He be good and just, whence comes it that, fo reknowing everything, He has allowed sorrow and evil to exist; and how to reconcile with His benevol ence and wisdom the prosperity of vice and the misfortunes of virtue in this world?\" And then, as to man himself, recurred these other ques tions, as they continue to recur to all of us: \"What is it in us that thinks ? Is Thought the mere re sult of material organization; or is there in us a soul that thinks, separate from and resident in the body? If the latter, is it eternal and uncreated; and if not, how created? Is it distinct from God, or an emanation from Him? Is it inherently immortal, or only so by destination, because God has willed it? Is it to return to and be merged in Him, or ever to exist, separately from Him , with its present identity? \"If God has fore-seen and fore-arranged all that occurs, how has man any real free- will, or the least control over circumstanc es? How can anything be done against the will of In finite Omnipotence; and if all is done according to that will, how is there any wrong or evil, in what Infinite Wisdom and Infinite Power does not choose to prevent? \"What is the foundation of the moral law? Did God enact it of His own mere pleasure; and if so, can He not, when He pleases, repeal it ? Who shall assure us He will not repeal it, and ma ke right wrong, and virtue vice? Or is the moral law a necessity of His nature; and if so, who enacted it; and does not that assert a power, like the ol d Necessity, superior to Deity?\" And, close-following after these, came the great question of HEREAFTER, of another Life, of the soul's Destiny; and the thousand other collateral and subordinate questions, as to matter, spirit, futurity, and God, that have produced all the systems of philosophy, all metaphysics, and all theology, since the world began. What the old philosophic mind thought upon these great questions, we have already, to some extent, developed. With the Emanation-doctrine of the Gnostics and the Orient, we have endeavored to make you familiar. We have br ought you face to face with the Kabalists, the Essenes, and Philo the Jew. We have shown that, and how, much of the old mythology was derived from the daily and yearly recurring phenomena of the heavens. We hav e exhibited to you the anc ient notions by which they endeavored to explain to themselves the exis tence and prevalence of evil; and we have in some degree made known to you their metaphysical ideas as to the nat ure of the Deity. Much more remains to be done than it is within our power to do. We stand upon the sounding shore of the great ocean of Time. In front of us stretches out the heav ing waste of the illimitable Past; and its waves, as they roll up to our feet along the sparking slope of the yellow sands, bring to us, nw and then, from the depths of that boundless ocean, a shell, a few sp ecimens of algae torn rudely from their stems, a rounded pebble; and that is all; of all the vast treas ures of ancient thought that lie buried there, with the mighty anthem of the boundless ocean th undering over them forever and forever. Let us once more, and for the last time, along the s hore of that great ocean, gather a few more relics of the Past, and listen to its mighty voices, as t hey come, in fragmentary music, in broken and interrupted rhythm, whispering to us from the great bosom of the Past. "},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"Rites, creeds, and legends express, directly or sy mbolically, some leading idea, according to which the Mysteries of Being are supposed to be expl ained in Deity. The intricacies of mythical genealogies are a practical acknowledgment of t he mysterious nature of the Omnipotent Deity; displaying in their beautiful but ineffectual imagery the first efforts of the mi nd to communicate with nature: the flowers which fancy strewed before the yo uthful steps of Psyche, when she first set out in pursuit of the immortal object of her love. Theori es and notions, in all their varieties of truth and falsehood, are a machinery more or less efficacious, directed to the same end. Every religion was, in its origin, an embryo philosophy, or an attempt to interpret the unknown by mind; and it was only when philosophy, which is essentially progress, outgrew its firs t acquisitions, that religion became a thing apart, cherishing as unalterable dogmas the notions which philosophy had abandoned. Separated from philosophy, it became arrogant and fa ntastical, professing to have already attained what its more authentic representative was ev er pursuing in vain; and discovering, through its initiations and Mysteries, all that to its contracted view seemed wanting to re store the well-being of mankind, the means of purificati on and expiation, remedies for di sease, expedients to cure the disorders of the soul, and to propitiate the gods. Why should we attempt to confine the idea of th e Supreme Mind within an arbitrary barrier, or exclude from the limits of veracity any conception of the Deity, which, if im perfect and inadequate, may be only a little more so than our own? \"The name of God,\" says Hobbes, \"is used not to make us conceive Him, or He is inconceivable, but th at we may honor Him.\" \"Believe in God, and adore Him,\" said the Greek Poet, \"but investigate Him not; the inquiry is fruitless, seek not to discover who God is; for, by the desire to k now, you offend Him who chooses to remain unknown.\" \"When we attempt,\" says Philo, \"to investigate the essence of the Absolute Being, we fall into an abyss of perplexity; and the only benefit to be derived from such researches is the conviction of their absurdity.\" Yet man, though ignorant of the constitution of the dust on which he treads , has ventured, and still ventures, to speculate on the nature of God, and to define dogmatically in creeds the subject least within the compass of his facultie s; and even to hate and persecute those who will not accept his views as true. But though a knowledge of the Divine Essence is impossible, the concepti ons formed respecting it are interesting, as indications of intellectual develop ment. The history of religion is the history of the human mind; and the conception formed by it of Deity is always in exact relation to its moral and intellectual attainments. The one is th e index and the measure of the other. The negative notion of God, which consists in abstracting the inferi or and finite, is, according to Philo, the only way in which it is possible for man worthily to apprehend the nature of God. After exhausting the varieties of symbolis m, we contrast the Divine Greatn ess with human littleness, and employ expressions apparently affirmative, such as \"Infinite,\" \"Almighty,\" \"Allwise,\" \"Omnipotent,\" \"Eternal,\" and the like; which in reality amount only to denying, in regard to God, those limits which confine the faculties of man; and thus we remain content with a name which is a mere conventional sign and confession of our ignorance. The Hebrew and the Greek To ON expressed abstrac t existence, without ou tward manifestation or development. Of the same nature are the definitions , \"God is a sphere whose centre is everywhere, and whose circumference nowhere;\" \"God is He who se es all, Himself unseen:\" and finally, that of Proclus and Hegel --\"the To --that which has no outward and positive exist ence.\" Most of the so- called ideas or definitions of the \"Absoute\" are only a collection of negations; from which, as they affirm nothing, nothing is learned. God was first recognized in the heavenly bodies and in the elements. When man's consciousness of his own intellectuality was matured, and he became convinced that the internal faculty of thought was something more subtle than even the most s ubtle elements, he transferred that new conception to the object of his worship, and deified a mental principle instead of a physical one. He in every case makes God after his own image; for do what we will, the highe st efforts of hu man thought can conceive nothing higher than the supremacy of intellect; and so he ever comes back to some familiar type of exalted humanity. He at first deifies nature, a nd afterward himself."},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"The eternal aspiration of the religious sentiment in man is to become united with God. In his earliest development, the wish and its fulfillment were simultaneous, through unquestioning belief. In proportion as the conception of De ity was exalted, the notion of His terrestrial presence or proximity was abandoned and the difficulty of comprehendi ng the Divine Government, together with the glaring superstitious evils arising out of its misinterpret ation, endangered the belief in it altogether. Even the lights of Heaven, which, as \"bright pot entates of the sky,\" were formerly the vigilant directors of the economy of earth now shine dim and distant, and Uriel no more descends upon a sunbeam. But the real change has been in the progre ssive ascent of man's own faculties, and not in the Divine Nature; as the Stars are no more distant now than when they were supposed to rest on the shoulders of Atlas. And yet a little sense of disappointment and humiliation a ttended the first awakening of the soul, when reason, looking upwa rd toward the Deity, wa s impressed with a dizzy sense of having fallen. But hope revives in despondency; and every nation that ever advanced beyond the most elementary conceptions, felt the necessity of an attempt to fill the chasm, real or imaginary, sepa rating man from God. To do this was the great task of poetry, ph ilosophy, and religion. Hence the personifications of God's attributes, developments, and manifestat ions, as \"Powers,\" \"Intelligences,\" \"Angels,\" \"Emanations;\" through which and the oracular fa culty in himself, man could place himself in communion with God. The various ranks and orders of mythical beings im agined by Persians, Indians, Egyptians, or Etrurians, to preside over the various departmen ts of nature, had each his share in a scheme to bring man into closer approximation to the Deity; they eventually gave way only before an analogous though less picturesque symbolis m; and the Deities and Daemons of Greece and Rome were perpetuated with only a change of nam es, when their offices were transferred to Saints and Martyrs. The attempts by which reason had sometimes endeavored to span the unknown by a bridge of metaphysics, such as the idealistic systems of Zoro aster, Pythagoras, or Plato, were only a more refined form of the poetical illusi ons which satisfied the vulgar; and man still look ed back with longing to the lost golden age, when his ancestors co mmuned face to face with the Gods; and hoped that, by propitiating Heaven, he might accelerate the renew al of it in the islands of the Far West, under the sceptre of Kronos, or in a centralization of political power at Jerusalem. His eager hope overcame even the terrors of the grave; for the Divine power was as infini te as human expectation, and the Egyptian, duly ensepulchred in the Lybian Catacombs, was supposed to be already on his way to the Fortunate Abodes under the guidance of Hermes, there to obtain a perfect association and reunion with his God. Remembering what we have already said elsewhere in regard to the old ideas concerning the Deity, and repeating it as little as possible, let us once more put ourselves in communion with the Ancient poetic and philosophic mind, and endeavor to learn of it what it thought, and how it solved the great problems that have ever tortured the human intellect. The division of the First and Su preme Cause into two parts, one Acti ve and the other Passive, the Universe Agent and Patient, or the hermaphroditi c God-World, is one of the most ancient and widespread dogmas of philosophy or natural theology. Almost every ancient people gave it a place in their worship, their myst eries, and their ceremonies. Ocellus Lucanus, who seems to have lived shortly af ter Pythagoras opened his School in Italy, five or six hundred years before our era, and in the time of Solon, Thales, and the other Sages who had studied in the Schools of Egypt, not only recogniz es the eternity of the Universe, and its divine character as an unproduced and indestructible being, but also the distincti on of Active and Passive causes in what he terms the Grand Whole, or th e single hermaphroditic Being that comprehends all existences, as well causes as effects; and whic h is a system regularly ordered, perfect and complete, of all Natures. He well apprehended the dividing line that separat es existence eternally the same, from that which eternally changes; the natu re of celestial from that of terrestrial bodies, that of causes from that of effects, that which is from that which only BECOMES,--a distinction that"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"naturally struck every thinking man. We shall not quote his language at full length. Th e heavenly bodies, he thought, are first and most noble; they move of themselves, and ever revolve, without change of form or essence. Fire, water, earth, and air change incessantly and continually, not place, but form. Then, as in the Universe there are generation and cause of generation,--as generat ion is where there are change and displacement of parts, and cause where there is stability of nature, evidently it belongs to what is the cause of generation, to move and to act, and to the recipi ent, to be made and moved. In his view, everything above the Moon was the habitation of the gods; all bel ow, that of Nature and discord; this operates dissolution of things made; that, production of those that are being made. As the world is unproduced and indest nlctible, as it had no beginning, and will have no end, necessarily the principle that operates generation in another than itself , and that which operates it in itself, have co- existed. The former is all above the moon, and especially the sun: the latter is the s ublunary world. Of these two parts, one active, the other passi ve--one divine and always the same, the other mortal and ever changing, all that we call the \"wor ld\" or \"universe\" is composed. These accorded with the principles of the Egypti an philosophy, which held t hat man and the animals had always existed together with t he world; that they were its effe cts, eternal like itself. The chief divisions of nature into active and passive causes, its system of generation and des truction, and the concurrence of the two great prin ciples, Heaven and earth, uniting to form all things, will, according to Ocellus, always continue to exist. \"Enough.\" he concludes, \"as to the Universe, the generations and destructions effected in it, the mode in which it now exists , the mode in which it will ever exist, by the eternal qualities of the two principles, one always movi ng, the other always moved; one always governing, the ot her always governed.\" Such is a brief summary of the doctrine of this philosopher, whose work is one of the most ancient that has survived to us. The subject on which he tr eated occupied in his time all men's minds: the poets sang of cosmogonies and theogonies, and the philosophers wrote treatises on the birth of the world and the elements of its composition. The cosmog ony of the Hebrews, attr ibuted to Moses; that of the Phoenicians, ascribed to Sanchoniathon; that of the Greeks, composed by Hesiod; that of the Egyptians, the Atlantes, and the Cretans, preser ved by Diodorus Siculus; the fragments of the theology of Orpheus, divided among different writers; the books of the Persians, or their Boundehesh; those of the Hindus; the traditions of the Chinese a nd the people of Macassar; the cosmogonic chants which Virgil puts in the mouth of Iopas at Carthage; and those of the old Silenus, the first book of the Metamorphoses of Ovid; all te stify to the aniquity a nd universality of these fictions as to the origin of the world and its causes. At the head of the causes of nature, Heaven and earth were la ced; and the most apparent parts of each, the sun, the moon, the fixed stars and planet s, and, above all, the zodiac, among the active causes of generation; and among the passive, the several elements. These causes were not only classed in the progressive order of their energy, Heaven and earth h eading the respective lists, but distinct sexes were in some sort assigned to them, and characteristics analogous to the mode in which they concur in universal generation. The doctrine of Ocellus was the general doctrine ever ywhere, it naturally occurring to all to make the same distinction. The Egyptians did so, in select ing those animals in which they recogized these emblematic qualities, in order to symbolize the do uble sex of the Universe. Their God KNEPH, out of whose mouth issued the Orphic egg, whence the author of the Clementin e Recognitions makes a hermaphroditic figure to emerge, uniting in itself the two principles whereof Heaven and the earth are forms, and which enter into the organizati on of all beings which the heavens and the earth engender by their concourse, furnishes another em blem of the double power , active and passive, which the ancients saw in the Universe, and whic h they symbolized by the egg.

The Brahmins of India expressed the same cosm ogonic idea by a statue, representative of the Universe, uniting in itself both sexes. The male se x offered an image of the su n, centre of the active principle, and the female sex that of the moon, at the sphere whereof, proceeding downward, the passive portion of nature begins. The Lingam, unto t he present day revered in the Indian temples, being but the conjunction of the organs of generatio n of the two sexes, was an emblem of the same. The Hindus have ever had the great est veneration for this symbol of ever-reproductive nature. The Greeks consecrated the same symbols of universal fruitfulness in their Mysteries; and they were exhibited in the sanctuaries of Eleusis. They appear among the sculptured ornaments of all the Indian temples. Tertullian accuses the Valentinia ns of having adopted the custom of venerating them; a custom, he says, introduced by Melam pus from Egypt into Greece. The Egyptians consecrated the Phallus in the Mysteries of Osiris and Isis, as we learn from Plutarch and Diodorus Siculus; and the latter assures us that these embl ems were not consecrated by the Egyptians alone, but by every people. They certainly were so am ong the Persians and Assyrians; and they were regarded everywhere as symbolic of the generative and productive powers of all animated beings. In those early ages, the works of Nature and all her agents were sacred like herself. For the union of Nature with hers elf is a chaste marriage, of whic h the union of man and woman was a natural image, all their organs were an expressi ve emblem of the double energy which manifests itself in Heaven and Earth uniting together to produce all beings. \"The Heavens,\" says Plutarch, \"seemed to men to fulfill the func tions of father, and the Earth of mother. The former im pregnated the earth with its fertiliz ing rains, and the earth, receiving them , became fruitful and brought forth.\" Heaven, which covers and embraces the earth everyw here, is her potent spouse, uniting himself to her to make her fruitful, without which she would lan guish in everlasting ster ility, buried in the shades of chaos and of night. Their union is their marriage their productions or parts are their children. The skies are our Father, and Nature the great Mother of us all. This idea was not the dogma of a single sect, but the general opinion of all the Sages. \"Nature was divided,\" says Cicero, \"into two parts, one active, a nd the other that submitted itself to this action, which it received, and which modi fied it. The former was deemed to be a Force, and the latter the material on which that Force exer ted itself.\" Macrobius repeated al most literally the doctrine of Ocellus. Aristotle termed the earth the fruitful mother, environed on all sides by the air. Above it was Heaven, the dwelling-place of the gods and the divine stars, its substance ether, or a fire incessantly moving in circles, divine and incorruptible, and subject to no change. Below it, nature, and the elements, nutable and acted on, corruptible and mortal. Synesius said that generations were effected in the portions of the Universe which we inhabit; while the cause of generations resided in the portions above us, whence descend to us the germs of the effects produced here below. Proclus and Simpliciu s deemed Heaven the Active Cause and Father, relatively to the earth. The former says that the World or the Whole is a single Animal; what is done in it, is done by it; the same World acts, and ac ts upon itself. He divides it into \"Heaven\" and \"Generation.\" In the former, he says, are plac ed and arranged the cons ervative causes of generation, superintended by the Genii and Gods. T he Earth, or Rhea, associated ever with saturn in production, is mother of the effects of which Heaven is Father; the womb or bosom that receives the fertilizing energy of the God that engenders ages. The great work of generation is operated, he says, primarily by the action of the Sun, and secon darily by that of the Moon, so that the Sun is the primitive source of this energy, as father and chie f of the male gods that form his court. He follows the action of the male and female principles through all the portions a nd divisions of nature, attributing to the forme r the origin of stabilit y and identity, to the latter, th at of diversity and mobility. Heaven is to the earth, he says, as the male to the female. It is the movement of the heavens that, by their revolutions, furnished the seminal incite ments and forces, whose em anations received by the earth, make it fruitful, and cause it to produce animals and plants of every kind. Philo says that Moses recognized th is doctrine of two causes, ac tive and passive; but made the former to reside in the Mind or Intelligence external to matter."},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"The ancient astrologers divided th e twelve signs of the Zodiac into six male and six female, and assigned them to six male a six female Gods. H eaven and Earth, or Ouranos and Ghe, were among the most ancient nations, the firs t and most ancient Divinities. We find them in the Phoenician history of Sanchoniathon, and in the Grecian Genealogy of the Gods given by Hesiod. Everywhere they marry, and by their union produce the later Gods. \"In the beginning.\" says Apollodorus, \"Ouranos or the Heavens was Lord of all the Universe: he took to wife Ghe or the earth, and had by her many children.\" They were the first Gods of the Cretan s, and under other names, of the Armenians, as we learn from Berosus, and of Panchaia, an island South of Arabia, as we learn from Euhemerus. Orpheus made the Divinity or the \"Great Whole, \" male and female, because, he said, it could produce nothing, unless it united in itself the pr oductive force of both sexes. He called Heaven PANGENETOR, the Father of all things, most ancient of Beings, beginning and end of all, containing in Himself the incorruptible and unwearying force of Necessity. The same idea obtained in the rude North of Europe. The Scythians made the earth to be the wife of Jupiter; and the Germans adored her under the name of HERTA. The Celts worshipped the Heavens and the Earth, and said that without the former the latter would be sterile, and that their marriage produced all things. The Scandinavians acknowledged BOR or the Heavens, and gave FURTUR, his son, the Earth as hi s wife. Olaus Rudbeck adds, that their ance stors were persuaded that Heaven intermarried with the Earth, and thus uniting his forc es with hers, produced animals and plants. This marriage of Heaven and Earth produc ed the Azes, Genii famous in the theology of the North. In the theology of the Phrygians and Lydi ans, the ASII were born of the marriage of the Supreme God with the Earth, and Firmicus informs us that the Phrygians attrihuted to the Earth supremacy over the other elements, and considered her the Great Mother of all things. Virgil sings the impregnation of th e joyous earth, by the Ether, its spouse, that descends upon its bosom, fertilizing it with rains. Columella sings the loves of Na ture and her marriage with Heaven annually consummated at the sweet Spring-time. He describes the Sp irit of Life, the soul that animates the world, fired with passion of Love, unitin g with Nature and itself, it self a part of Nature, and filling its own bosom with new productions. This uni on of the universe with itself, this mutual action of two sexes, he terms \"t he great Secrets of Nature,\" \"the Mysteries of the Union of Heaven with Earth, imaged in the Sacred My steries of Atys and Bacchus.\" Varro tells us that the great Di vinities adored at Samothrace were the Heavens and the Earth, considered as First Causes or Primal Gods, an d as male and female agents, one bearing to the other the relations that the Soul and Principle of Movement bear to the body or the matter that receives them. These were the gods revered in the Mysteries of that Island, as they were in the orgies of Phoenicia. Everywhere the sacred body of Nature was covered with the veil of allegory, which concealed it from the profane, and allowed it to be seen only by the sage who thought it worthy to be the object of his study and investigation. She showed herself to those only who loved her in spirit and in truth, and she abandoned the indifferent and careless to error and to ignorance. \"The Sages of Greece,\" says Pausanias, \"never wrote otherwise than in an eni gmatical manner, never nat urally and directly.\" \"Nature,\" says Sallust the Philosopher, \"should be su ng only in a language that imitates the secrecy of her processes and operations. She is herself an enigma. We see only bodies in movement; the forces and springs that move them are hidden fr om us.\" The poets inspired by the Divinity, the wisest philosophers, all the theologians, the chiefs of the initiations and Mysteries, even the gods uttering their oracles, have borrowed the figurati ve language of allegory. \"The Egyptians,\" says Proclus, \"preferred that mode of teaching, and spoke of the great secrets of Nature, only in mythological enigmas.\" The Gymnoso phists of India and the Druids of Gaul lent to science the same enigmatic language, and in the same st yle wrote the Hierophants of Phoenicia. The division of things into the active and the passi ve cause leads to that of the two Principles of Light and Darkness, connected with and correspond ing with it. For Light comes from the ethereal substance that composes the active cause, and darkness from earth or the gross matter which composes the passive cause. In Hesiod, the Eart h, by its union with Tartarus, engenders Typhon. Chief of the Powers or Genii of Darkness. Put it unites itself with the Ether or Ouranos, when it engenders the Gods of Olympus, or th e Stars, children of Starry Ouranos."},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"Light was the first Divinity worshippe d by men. To it they owed th e brilliant spectacl e of Nature. It seems an emanation from the Creator of all things , making known to our senses the Universe which darkness hides from our eyes, and, as it were givi ng it existence. Darkness, as it were, reduces all nature again to nothingness, and almost entirely annihilates man. Naturally, therefore, two substances of opposite na tures were imagined, to each of which the world was in turn subjected, one contributing to its felic ity and the other to its mi sfortune. Light multiplied its enjoyments; Darkness despoiled it of them: the former was its friend, the la tter its enemy. To one all good was attributed; to the other all evil; and thus the words \"Light\" and \"Good\" became synonymous, and the words \"Darkness\" and \"Evil. \" It seeming that Good and Evil could not flow from one and the same source, any more than c ould Light and Darkness, men naturally imagined two Causes or Principles, of different natures and opposite in their effects, one of which shed Light and Good, and the other Darkne ss and Evil, on the Universe. This distinction of the two Principles was admi tted in all the Theologies, and formed one of the principal bases of all religions. It entered as a primary element into the sacred fables, the cosmogonies and the Mysteries of antiquity. \"We are not to suppose,\" says Plutarch, \"that the Principles of the Universe are inanimate bodies, as Democritus and Epicurus thought; nor that a matter devoid of qualities is organized and arrange d by a single Reason or Providence, Sovereign over all things, as the Stoics held; for it is not po ssible that a single Being, g ood or evil, is the cause of all inasmuch as God can in nowise be the caus e of any evil. The harmony of the Universe is a combination of contraries, like the strings of a lyre, or that of a bow, which alternately is stretched and relaxed.\" \"The good,\" says Euripides, \"is neve r separated from the Evil. The two must mingle, that all may go well.\" And this opin ion as to the two principles, cont inues Plutarch, \"is that of all antiquity. From the Theologians an d Legislators it passed to the Po ets and Philosophers. Its author is unknown; but the opinion itself is established by the traditio ns of the whole human race, and consecrated in the mysteries and sacrifices both of the Greeks and Barbarians, wherein was recognized the dogma of opposing principles in na ture, which, by their contrariety, produce the mixture of good and evil. We must admit two contra ry causes, two opposing powers, which lead, one to the right and the other to the lef t, and thus control our life, as they do the sublunary world, which is therefore subject to so many changes and irregularit ies of every kind. For if there can be no effect without a cause, and if the G ood cannot be the cause of the Evil, it is absolut ely necessary that there should be a cause for the Evil, as there is one for the Good.\" This doctrine, he adds, has been generally received among most nations, and espec ially by those who have had the greatest reputation for wisdom. All have admitted two gods , with different occupations, one making the good and the other the evil found in nature. The former has been styled \"God,\" the latter \"Demon.\" The Persians, or Zoroaster, named the former Ormuzd and the latter Ahriman; of whom they said one was of the nature of Light, the other of that of Darkness. The Egyptians called the former Osiris, and the latter Typhon, his eternal enemy. The Hebrews, at least after their return from the Persian captivity, had their good Deity, and the Devil, a bad and malicious Spirit, ever opposing Go d, and Chief of the Angels of Darkness, as God was of those of Light. The word \"Satan\" means, in Hebrew, simply, \"The Adversary.\" The Chaldeans, Plutarch says, had their good and evil stars. The Greeks had their Jupiter and Pluto, and their Giants and Titans, to whom were assigned the attributes of the Serpent with which Pluto or Serapis was encircled, and the shape whereof was assumed by Typhon, Ahriman, and the Satan of the Hebrews. Every people had something equivalent to this. The People of Pegu believe in two Principles, one author of Good and the other of Evil, and strive to propitiate the latter, while they think it needless to worship th e former, as he is incapable of doing evil. The people of Java, of the Mo luccas, of the Gold Coast, the Ho ttentots, the peopl e of Teneriffe and Madagascar, and the Savage Tribes of America, all worship and strive to avert the anger and propitiate the good-will of the Evil Spirit. But among the Greeks, Egyptians, Chaldeans, Pe rsians, and Assyrians, the doctrine of the two Principles formed a complete and regularly arrange d theological system. It was the basis of the religion of the Magi and of Egypt. The author of an ancient work, attributed to Origen, says that"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"Pythagoras learned from Zarastha, a Magus at Babylon (the same, perhaps, as Zerdusht or Zoroaster), that there are two principles of all things, whereof one is the father and the other the mother; the former, Light, and the latter, Dark ness. Pythagoras thought that the Dependencies on Light were warmth, dryness, lightness, swiftnes s; and those on Darkness, cold, wet, weight, and slowness; and that the world derived its existence from these two principles, as from the male and the female. According to Porphyry, he conceived two opposing powers, one good, which he termed Unity, the Light, Right, the Equa l, the Stable, the Straight; the ot her evil, which he termed Binary, Darkness, the Left, the Unequal, the Crooked. Thes e ideas he received from the Orientals, for he dwelt twelve years at Babylon, st udying with the Magi. Varro says he recognized two Principles of all things, - the Finite and the Infinite, Good and Evil, Life and Death, Day a Night. White he thought was of the nature of the Good Principle, and Black of that of the Evil; that Light and Darkness, Heat and Cold, the Dry and the Wet, mingled in equal proportions; that Summer was the triumph of heat, and Winter of cold; that their equal combinati on produced Spring and Autumn, the former producing verdure and favorable to health, and the latter, deter iorating everything, giving birth to maladies. He applied the same idea to the rising and setting of th e sun; and, like the Ma gi, held that God or Ormuzd in the body resembled light, and in the soul, truth . Aristotle, like Plato, admitted a pr inciple of Evil, resident in matter and in its eternal imperfection. The Persians said that Ormuzd, born of the pure Li ght, and Ahriman, born of darkness, were ever at war. Ormuzd produced six Gods , Beneficence, Truth, Good Or der, Wisdom, Riches, and Virtuous Joy. These were so many emanations from the Good Principle, so many blessi ngs bestowed by it on men. Ahriman, in his turn, produced six Devs, opp onents of the six emanations from Ormuzd. Then Ormuzd made himself three times as great as before, ascended as far above the sun as the sun is above the earth, and adorned the heavens with star s, of which he made Sirius the sentinel or advance-guard: that he then created twenty-four other Deities, and placed them in an egg, where Ahriman also placed twenty-four others, created by him, who broke the egg, and so intermingled Good and Evil. Theopompus adds that, according to the Magi, for two terms of three thousand years, each of the two Principles is to be by turns victor and the other vanquished; then for three thousand more for each they are to contend with ea ch other, each destroying reciprocally the works of the other; after which Ahriman is to perish , and men, wearing transparent bodies, to enjoy unutterable happiness. The twelve great Deities of the Persians, the si x Amshaspands and six Devs, marshalled, the former under the banner of Light, and the latter under that of Darkness, are the twelve Zodiacal Signs or Months; the six supreme signs, or those of Light, or of Spring and Summer, commencing with Aries, and the six inferior, of Darkness, or of Autumn and Winter, commencing with Libra. Limited Time, as contradistinguished from Time without limits, or Eternity, is Time created and measured by the celestial revolutions. It is comprehended in a period divided into twelve parts, each subdivided into a thousand parts, which the Persians termed years. Thus the circle annually traversed by the Sun was divided into 12,000 parts, or each sign into 3,000: and thus, each year, the Principle of Light and Good triumphed for 3,000 years, that of Evil and Darkness for 3,000, and th ey mutually destroyed each other's labors for 6,000, or 3,000 for each : so that the Zodiac was equally divided between them. And accordingly Ocellus Lucanus, the Disciple of Pythagoras, held that the principal cause of all sublunary effects resided in the Zodiac, and that from it flowed the good or bad influences of the planets that revolved therein. The twenty-four good and twenty-four evil Deities, enclosed in the Egg, are the forty-eight constellations of the ancient sphere, equally divi ded between the realms of Light and Darkness, on the concavity of the celestial s phere which was apportioned among them; and which, enclosing the world and planets, was the mystic and sacred egg of the Magi, the Indians, and the Egyptians,-- the egg that issued from the mouth of the God Kneph, that figured as t he Orphic Egg in the Mysteries of Greece, that issued from the God Chumong of the Coresians, and from the Egyptian Osiris and the God Phanes of the Modern Orphics, Principle of Light,--the egg cr ushed by the Sacred Bull of the Japanese, and from which the world emerged; that pl aced by the Greeks at the feet of Bacchus the bull-horned God, and from which Aristophanes makes Love emerge, who with Night organizes Chaos.

Osiris conquers Typhon, and Ormuzd , Ahriman, when, at the Vernal Equinox, the creative action of Heaven and its demiourgic energy is most strongly manifested. Then the principle of Light and Good overcomes that of Darkness and Evil, and the world rejoices, redeemed from cold and wintry darkness by the beneficent Sign in to which the Sun then enters tr iumphant and rejoicing, after his resurrection. From the doctrine of the two Princi ples, Active and Passive grew that of the Universe, animated by a Principle of Eternal Life, and by a Universal Soul , from which every isolated and temporary being received at its birth an emanation, which, at the death of such being, returned to its source. The life of matter as much belonged to nature as did matt er itself; and as life is manifested by movement, the sources of life must needs seem to be placed in those luminous and et ernal bodies, and above all in the Heaven in which they revolve, and which whirls them al ong with itself in that rapid course that is swifter than all other movement. And fire and heat have so great an anal ogy with life, that cold like absence of movement, seemed the distinctive char acteristic of death. Accordingly, the vital fire that blazes in the Sun and produces the heat that vivifies everything, was regarded as the principle of organization and life of all sublunary beings. According to this doctrine, the Universe is not to be regarded in its creative and eternal action, merely as an immense machine moved by powerful springs and forced into a continual movement which, emanating from the circumfe rence, extends to the centre acts and re-acts in every possible direction, and re-produces in succe ssion all the varied forms which ma tter receives. So to regard it would be to recognize a cold and purely mechanical action, the energy of which could never produce life. On the contrary, it was thought, the Universe sh ould be deemed an immense Being, always living, always moved and always moving in an eternal activity inherent in itself, and which, subordinate to no foreign cause, is communicated to all its parts , connects them together, and makes of the world of things a complete and perfect whole. The order and harmony which reign therein seem to belong to and be a part of it, and the des ign of the various plan s of construction of organized beings would seem to be graven in its Supr eme Intelligence, source of all the other Intellig ences which it communicates together with life to man. Nothing exis ting out of it, it must be regarded as the principle and term of all things. Chaeremon had no reason for saying that the Ancient Egyptians, inventors of the sacred fables, and adorers of the Sun and the other luminaries, saw in the Universe only a machine, without life and without intelligence, either in its whole or in it s parts; and that thei r cosmogony was a pure Epicureanism, which required only matter and mo vement to organize its world and govern it. Such an opinion would necessarily exclude all religious worship. Wherever we suppose a worship, there we must suppose intelligen t Deities who receive it, and are sensib le to the homage of their adorers; and no other people were so religious as the Egyptians. On the contrary, with them the immense, immut able, and Eternal Being, termed \"God\" or \"the Universe,\" had eminently, and in all their plenit ude, that life and intelligence which sublunary beings, each an infinitely small and temporary portion of itse lf, possess in a far inferior degree and infinitely less quantity. It was to them, in some sort, like the Ocean, whence the springs, brooks, and rivers have risen by evaporation, and to the bosom whereof they return by a longer or shorter course, and after a longer or shorter separation from the immense mass of its waters. The machine of the Universe was, in their view, like t hat of man, moved by a Principle of Life which kept it in eternal"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"activity, and circulated in all it s parts. The Universe was a livi ng and animated being, like man and the other animals; or rather they were so only because the Universe was essentially so, and for a few moments communicated to each an infinitely minute portion of its eternal lif e, breathed by it into the inert and gross matter of sublunary bodies. T hat withdrawn, man or t he animal died; and the Universe alone, living and circulati ng around the wrecks of their bodies, by its eternal movement, organized and animated new bodies, returning to th em the eternal fire and subtle substance which vivifies itself, and which, incorporated in its immense mass, was its universal soul."},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":" MORALS and DOGMA by ALBERT PIKE Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry , prepared for the Supreme Council of the Thirty Third Degree for the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States: Charleston, 1871. 28º - Knight of the Sun or Prince Adept ( Part 3 ) These were the ancient ideas as to this Great GOD, Father of all the gods, or of the World; of this BEING, Principle of all things , and of which nothing other than itself is Principle,--the Universal caus e that was termed God. Soul of the Universe, eternal like it, immense like it, s upremely active a nd potent in its varied operations, penetrating all parts of this vast body, impressi ng a regular and symmetrical movement on the sphe res, making the elem ents instinct with activity and order, mingling with everything, organizing everything, vivifying and preserving everything,--this was the UNIVERSE-GOD wh ich the ancients ad ored as Supreme Cause and God of Gods. A nchises, in the AEneid, ta ught AEneas this doctrine of Pythagoras, learned by him from his Masters, the Egyp tians, in regard to the Soul and Intelligence of the Universe, from which our soul s and intelligences, as well as our life and that of the animals, emanate, Heaven, Eart h, the Sea, the Moon and the Star s, he said, are moved by a principle of inte rnal life which perpetuates their existence; a great intelligent soul, that penetra tes every part of the vast body of the Universe, and, mingling with everything, agitate s it by an eternal movement. It is the source of life in all living things. The force which animates all, emanates from the eternal fire that burns in Heaven. In the Geor gics, Virgil repeats the same doctrine; and that, at the death of every animal, the life that animated it, pa rt of the universa l life, returns to its Principle and to the source of life that circulates in the sphere of the Stars. Servius makes God the active Cause that organizes the elements into bodies, the vivifying breath or spirit, that, spreading through matte r or the elem ents, produces and engenders all things. The elements compose the substa nce of our bodies: God composes the souls that vivi fv these bodies. Fr om it come the in stincts of animals, from it their life, he says: and when they di e, that life returns to and re-enters into the Universal Soul, and their b odies into Universal Matter. Timceus of Locria and Plat o his Commentator wrote of the Soul of the World, devoloping the doctrine of Py thagoras, who thought, says Cic ero, that God is the Universal Soul, resident ever ywhere in nature, and of which our Souls are but emanations. '\"God is one,\" sa ys Pythagoras, as cited by Ju stin Martyr: \"He is not, as some think, wi thout the world, bu t within it, and entire in its entirety. He sees all that becomes, forms all im mortal beings, is the auth or of their powers and performances, the origin of all things, the Light of Heaven, the Father, the Intelligence, the Soul of all bei ngs, the Mover of all spheres.\" God, in the view of Pytha goras, was ONE, a single su bstance, whose continuous parts extended through all the Universe, without sepa ration, difference, or"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"inequality, like the soul in the human body. He denied the doctr ine of the spiritualists, who had severed the Divinity from t he Universe, making Him exist apart from the Universe, wh ich thus became no more t han a material work, on which acted the Abstract Caus e, a God, isolated from it. The Ancient Theology did not so separate God fr om the Universe. This Eusebius attests, in saying that but a small number of wise men, like Moses, had sought for God or the Cause of all, outside of that AIL; while the Philosophers of Egypt and Phoenicia, real authors of all the old Cosmogonies, had placed the Supreme Cause in the Universe itself, and in its parts, so that, in their view, the world and all its parts are in God. The World or Universe was t hus compared to man: the Pr inciple of Life that moves it, to that which mo ves man; the Soul of the World to that of man. Therefore Pythagoras called man a microc osm, or little world, as possessing in miniature all the qualities found on a great scale in the Universe; by his reason and intelligence partaking of the Divine Nature : and by his faculty of ch anging aliments into other substances, of growing, and reproducing himself, partak ing of elementary Nature. Thus he made the Universe a great intelligent Be ing, like man-- an immense Deity, having in itself, what man has in himsel f, movement, life, and intelligence, and besides, a perpetuity of exis tence, which man has not; a nd, as having in itself perpetuity of movement and life, therefore the Su preme Cause of all. Everywhere extended, this Un iversal Soul does not, in th e view of Pythagoras, act everywhere equally nor in the same manner. T he highest portion of the Universe, being as it were its head, seemed to him its princi pal seat, and there was the guiding power of the rest of the world. In th e seven concentric spheres is resident an eternal order, fruit of th e intelligence, the Universa l Soul that moves, by a constant and regular progression, the immortal bodi es that form the harmonious system of the heavens. Manilius says: \"I sing the in visible and potent S oul of Nature; that Divine Substance which, everywhere inherent in Heaven Earth, and the Waters of the Ocean, forms the bond that holds together and makes one all the parts of t he vast body of the Universe. It, balancing all Forces, and harmoniously arr anging varied relations of the many members of the worl d, maintains it the life and regular mo vement that agitate it, as a result of acti on of the living breat h or single spirit th at dwells in all parts, circulates in a ll the channels of universal nature, flashes wi th rapidity to all its points, and gives to animated bodies config urations appropriate to the organization of each .... This eternal La w, this Divine Force, that maintains the harmony the world, makes use of the Celestial Signs to organiz e and guide the animated creatures that breathe u pon the earth; and gives each of them the character and habits most appropriate. By action of this Force Heaven rules the cond ition of the Earth and of its fields cult ivated by the husb andman: it gives us or takes from us vegetation and harvests: it ma kes the great ocean over-pa ss its limits at the flow, and retire within t hem again at ebbing , of the tide.\" Thus it is no longer by m eans of a poetic fiction only that heavens and the earth become animated and personi fied, and a deemed living ex istences, from which other existences proceed. For now they live, with their own life, a life eternal like th bodies, each gifted with a life and perhaps a soul, like those man, a portion of the universal life and universal soul; and the other bodies that they form, and which"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"they contain in the bosoms, live only through them and wi th their life, as the embry lives in the bosom of its mother, in consequence and by means a the life communicated to it, and which the mother ever maintain s by the active power of her own life.

Th e heavens, th e sun, great seat of generative po wer, the signs, the st ars, and the planets act only with the activity of the soul of th e Universe. From that soul, through them, come all the variations and challges of sublunary nature, of which the heavens and celestial bodies are but the secondary causes. The zodiac, with its signs, is an existence, immortal and divine, organized by the universal soul, and producing, or gathering in itself, all the varied emanations of t he different powe rs that make up the nature of the Divinity.\" This doctrine, that gave to the heavens and the sphere s living souls, each a portion of the universal soul, was of extreme antiquity. It was he ld by the ol d Sabaeans. It was taught by Timaeus, P]ato, Speusi ppus, Iamblichus, Ma crobius, Marcus Aurelius, and Pythagoras. W hen once men had assigned a soul to the Universe, containing in itself the pl enitude of the animal life of particular beings, and even of the stars, they soon supposed that soul to be essentiall y intelligent, and the source of intelligence of all inte lligent beings. Then th e Universe became to them not only animated but intelligent, and of that intelligence the diff erent parts of nature partook. Each soul was the vehicle, and, as it were, th e envelope of the intelligence that attached itself to it, and could repose nowhere else. With out a soul there could be no intelligence; and as there was a universal soul, source of all souls, the universal soul was gifted with a univers al intelligence, source of al l particular intelligences. So the soul of the world contain ed in itself the intelligence of the world. All the agents of nature into which the univ ersal soul entered, receiv ed also a portion of its intelligence, and the Universe, in its tota lity and in its part s, was filled with intelligences, that might be regarded as so many emanat ions from t he sovereign and universal intelligence. Wh erever the divine soul acte d as a cause, there also was intelligence; and thus Heaven, the star s, the elements, and all parts of the Universe, became the seats of so many divine intelligen ces. Every minutest portion of the great soul became a partial intelligence, and the more it was disengaged from gross matter, the more active and intell igent it was. And al l the old adorers of nature, the theologians, astrologers, and poets, and the most distinguished philosophers, supposed t hat the stars were so ma ny animated and intelligent beings, or eternal bodies, active causes of effects here below, whom a principle of life animated, and whom an intelligence directed, wh ich was but an emanation from, and a portion of, the unive rsal life and intel ligence of the world. The Universe itself was r egarded as a supremely intell igent being. Such was the doctrine of Timaeus of Locria. The soul of man wa s part of the intell igent soul of the Universe, and therefor e itself intelligent. His opini on was that of many other philosophers Cleanthes, a disci ple of ZENO, regarded the Universe as God, or a the unproduced and universal cause of all effects produc ed. He ascribed a soul and"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"intelligence to universal natur e, and to this in telligent soul, in his view, divinity belonged. From it the intelligence of man was an em anation, and shar ed its divinity. Chrysippus, the most subtle of the Stoics, placed in the universal reason that forms the soul and intelligence of nature, that di vine force or essence of the Divinity which he assigned to the world mov ed by the universal soul th at pervades its every part. An interlocutor in Cicero's work, De Na tura Deorum, formally argues that the Universe is necessarily inte lligent and wise, because man, an infinitely small portion of it, is so. Cicero makes the same argument in his or ation for Milo. The physicists came to the same conclusion as the pllilosophers. Th ey supposed that movement essentially belonged to th e soul, and the direction of regular and ordered movements to the intelligence. And, as both movement and order exist in the Universe, therefore, they held, there must be in it a soul and an intelligence that rule it, and are not to be di stinguished from itself; because the idea of the Universe is but the aggregate of all the particular ideas of all things that exist. The argument was, that the Heavens, and the Stars whic h make part of them, are animated, because they posse ss a portion of the Universal Soul: they ar e intelligent beings, because that Universal Soul, pa rt whereof they possess, is supremely intelligent and they share Divinity with Universal Nature, because Divinity resides in the Universal Soul and Intelligence which mo ve an rule the worl d, and of each of which they hold a share. By this process of logic, the interlocut or in Cicero assigned Divinity to the Stars, as ani mated beings gifted with sensib ility and intelligence, and composed of the noblest and purest portions of the et hereal substance, unmixed with matter of an alie n nature, an essentially cont aining light and heat. Hence he concluded them to be so many gods, of an intelligence superior to that of other existences, corresponding to th e lofty height in which they moved with such perfect regularity and admi rable harmony, with a movem ent spontaneous and free. Hence he made them \"Gods,\" active, eternal, and intelligent \"Causes\"; and peopled the realm of Heaven with a host of Eternal Intelligences, ce lestial Genii or Angels, sharing the universal Divinity , and associated with it in the administration of the Universe, and the domini on exercised over subl unary nature and man. We make the moti ve-force of the planets to be a mechanical la w, which we explain by the combination of two forces, the cent ripetal and centrifuga l, whose origin we cannot demonstrate, but whose force we can calculate. The ancients regarded them as moved by an intelligent force that had its origin in th e first and universal Intelligence. Is it so certain, after all, that we are any neare r the truth than they were; or that we know what our \"centripetal an d centrifugal force s\" mean; for what is a force? With us, the ent ire Deity acts upon and moves each pl anet, as He does the sap that circulates in the little blade of grass, and in the particles of blood in the tiny veins of the invi sible rotifer. With the Ancients, the Deity of each Star was but a portion of the Univ ersal God, the Soul of Nature. Ea ch Star and Plan et, with them, was moved of itself, and directed by its own special in telligence. And th is opinion of Achilles Tatius, Diodorus, Chrysippus, Aristotlc, Plat o, Heraclides of Pontus, Theophrastus, Simplicius, Ma crobius, and Proclus, that in each Star there is an immortal Soul and In telligence,--part of t he Universal Soul and Intelligence of the Whole,--this opinion of Orphe us, Plotinus, and t he Stoics, was in reality, that of many Christian philosophers. For Origen held the same opinion; and Augustin held that every visible thing in the world was super intended by an Aneglic Power: and"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"Cosma, the Monk, believed that every Star was under the guidance of an Angel; and the author of the Oc tateuch, written in the time of the Emperor Justin, says that they are moved by the impul se communicated to them by Angels stationed above the firmament. Whether t he stars were an imated beings, was a question that Christian antiquity did not de cide. Many of the Christian doctors bel ieved they were. Saint Augustin hesitates, Sain t Jerome doubts, if Solom on did not assi gn souls to the Stars. Saint Ambrose doe s not doubt they have soul s; and Pamphilus says that many of the Church belie ve they are reasonable be ings, while many think otherwise, but that neither one no r the other opini on is heretical. Thus the Ancient Thought, ear nest and sincere, wrought out the idea of a Soul inherent in the Un iverse and in its seve ral parts. The next step was to separate that Soul from the Universe, a nd give to it an external and independent existence an personality; still omnipresent, in every inch of space and in every particle of matter, and yet not a part of Nature, but its Cause and its Crea tor. This is the middle ground between the tw o doctrine of Pantheism (or that all is God, and God is in all and is all), on the one si de, and Atheism (o r that all is nature, and there is no other God), on the other; which doctri nes, after all, w hen reduced to thei r simplest terms, seem to be the same. We complacently congratulate ourselves on our recognition of personal God, as being the conception most suited to human sympathies, and exempt from the mystifications of Pantheism. But the Divinity re mains still a myster y, notwithstanding all the devices which symbolism, either from the organic or inorganic creation, can supply; and personification is itself a sym bol, liable misapprehensio n as much as, if not more so than, any other, since it is apt to degenerate into a me re reflection of our own infirmities; and hence any affirmative i dea or conception th at we can, our own minds, picture of the Deity, must needs be infinitely inadequate. The spirit of the Vedas (or sacred Indian Books, of great antiquity), as understood by their earliest as well as most recent expositors, is decidedly a pantheistic monotheism--one God, a He all in all; the many divinities, numerous as the prayers a dressed to them, being resolvable into th e titles and attribut es of a few, and ultimately into THE ONE. The machinery of per sonification was understood to have been unconsciously a ssumed as mere expedient to supply the deficiencies of language; and the Mi mansa justly considered itself as only interp reting the true meaning of the Mantras, when it proclaimed that, in t he beginning, \"Nothing was but Mind, the Creative Thought of Him which existed alone from the beginning, and breathed without afflat ion.\" The i dea suggested in the Mantras is dogmatically asserted and developed in the Upani schadas. The Vedanta philosophy, assuming the mystery of the \"ONE IN MANY\" as the fundam ental article of faith, maintained not only the Divi ne Unity, but the identi ty of matter and spir it. The unity which it advocates is that of mind . Mind is the Universal Elem ent, the One God, the Great Soul, Mahaatma. He is the material as well as effi cient cause, and the world is a texture of which he is bo th the web and the weaver. He is the Macrocosmos, the universal organism called Poor oosha, of which Fire, Air, and Sun are only the chief members. His head is light, his eyes the sun and moon, his breath the wind, his voice the opened Vedas.

Formless Himself, the Deity is present in all forms. His glory is displayed in the Universe as the image of the sun in water, which is, yet is not, t he luminary itself. All maternal agency and appearance, the subj ective world, are to a great extent phantasms, the notional representations of ignorance. They occupy, however, a middle ground betwe en reality and non-reality; t hey are unreal, because nothing exists but Brahm; yet in some degree real, inasmuch as they constitute an outward manifestation of him. They are a self-induced hypostasis of the Deity, under which He presents to Himself the w hole of animate and inanimate Nature, the actuality of the moment, the diversif ied appearances which succe ssively invest the one Pantheistic Spirit. The great aim of reason is to generalize; to di scover unity in mult iplicity, order in apparent confusion; to separate from the accidental and the tr ansitory, the stable and universal. In the contempl ation of Nature, and the vague, but almost intuitive perception of a general unifor mity of plan among endless varieties of operation and form, arise those solemn a nd reverential feel ings, which, if accompanied by intellectual activity, may ev entually ripen in to philosophy. Consciousness of self and of personal identity is co-exist ent with our existence. We cannot conceive of mental exis tence without it. It is not th e work of reflection nor of logic, nor the re sult of observation, experiment, and experience. It is a gift from God, like instinct; and that consciousness of a thinking soul which is really the person that we are, and other than our body , is the best and most solid proof of the soul's existence. We have the same co nsciousness of a Power on which we are dependent; which we can define and form an idea or picture of, as little as we can of the soul, and yet which we feel, and therefore know, ex ists. True at correct ideas of that Power, of th e Absolute Existence from which all procceds, we cannot trace; if by true and correct we m ean equate ideas; for of such we are not, with our limited faculties, capable. And ideas of His nature, so far corr ect as we are capable of entertaining, can only be attain ed either by direct inspirat ion or by the investigations of philosophy. The idea of the universal pr eceded the recogniti on of any system for its explanation. It was felt rather than un derstood; and it was long be fore the grand conception on which all philosophy rests re ceived through deli berate investigatio n that analytical development which might proper ly entitle it to the name. The sentiment, when first observed by the self-conscious mind, was, says Plato, \"a Divi ne gift, communicated to mankind by some Promethe us, or by those ancients who lived nearer to the gods than our degenerate selves.\" The mind deduced from its firs t experiences the notion of a general Cause or Antecedent, to which it shortly gave a name and personified it. This was the statement of a theorem, obscu re in proportion to its generality. It explained all things but itself. It wa s a true cause, but an incomprehensible one. Ages had to pass before the natu re of the theorem could rightly appreciated, a nd before men, acknowledging the First Cause to be an object of faith rather than science , were contented to confine their researches to those nearer relations of existenc e and succession, which are r eally within the reach of their faculties.

In poetry, the idea of Divine unity became, as in Natu re, obscured by a multifarious symbolism; and the notionalities of transcendental philosophy repo sed on views of nature scarcely more profound t han those of the earliest sym bolists. Yet the idea of unity was rather obscur ed than extinguishe d; and Xenophanes appeared as an enemy of Homer, only because he more emphatically insi sted on the monotheistic element, which, in poetry, has been comparatively ov erlooked. The first philosophy reasserted the unity which poetry had lost; but being u nequal to investigate its nature, it again resigned it to the world of approxim ate sensations, and became bewildered in materialism, considering the conceptional whole or First Element as some refinement of matt er, unchangeable in its e ssence, though subject to mutations of quality form in an eternal succession of seeming decay and regeneration; comparing it to water, air, or fire, as each endeavor ed to refine on the doctrine of his predecessor, or was influenced by a diffe rent class of theological traditions. In the philosophical systems, the Divine Activity, divi ded by the poets and by popular belief among a race of personifications, in whom the idea of descent replaced that of cause, or of pantheistic evolution, was restored, without subdivision or reservation, to nature as a whole; at first as a mech anical force or life; afterward as an all-pervading soul or inherent thought; and lastly as an external directing Intelligence. The Ionian revival of pant heism was materialistic. The Moving Force was inseparable from a mate rial element, a subtle yet visible ingredi ent. Under the form of air or fire, the principl e of life was associated with the most obvious material machinery of nature. Everything, it was sa id, is alive and full of gods. The wonders of the volcano, the m agnet, the ebb and fl ow of the tide, were vital indications, the breathing or moving of the Great Worl d-Animal. The imperceptible ether of Anaximenes had no positive quality beyond the atmospheric air wi th which it was easily confused: and even the \"Infinite\" of Anaximander, th ough free of the conditions of quality or quantity, was only an ideal chao s, relieved of its coarseness by negations. It was the illimitable storeho use or Pleroma, out of which is evolved the endless circle of pheno menal change. A moving Forc e was recognized in, but not clearly distinguis hed from, the material. Space, Time, Figure, an d Number, and other common forms or properties, which exis t only as attributes , were treated as substances, or at least as making a substantial connecti on between the objects to which they belong: and all t he conditions of material ex istence were supposed to have been evolved out of the Pythagorean Monad. The Eleatic philosophers treated conceptions not only as entities, but as the only entities, alone possessi ng the stability an certainty an d reality vainly sought among phenomena. The only real ity was Thought. \"All real exis tence,\" they said, \"is mental existence; non-existence, being inconceiva ble, is therefore impossble; existence fills up the whole r ange of thought, a nd is inseparable from it s exercise; thought and its object are one.\""},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"Xenophanes used ambiguou s language, applicab le to the material as well as to the mental, and exclusively appr opriate neither. In other words, he availed himself of material imagery to illustrate an indefinite meaning. In announ cing the universal being, he appealed to the heav ens as the visible manifestat ion, calling it spherical, a term borrowed from the mate rial world. He said that God was neit her moved nor unmoved, limited nor unlimited . He did not even attempt to express clearly what cannot be conceived clearly; admitting, says Simplicius, that such speculations were above physics. Parmenides employed similar expedients, comparing his metaphysical Deity to a spher e, or to heat an aggregate or a c ontinuity, and so involuntarily withdrawing its nominal attributes. The Atomic school, dividi ng the All into Matter and Force deemed matter unchangeable in its ultimate co nstitution, th ough infinitely variable in its resultant forms. They made all variety proceed from the varied combinatio ns of atoms; but they required no mover nor director of the atoms exte rnal to themse lves; universal Reason; but a Mechanical Eternal Necessity, like that of the Poets. Still it is doubtful whether there ever was a ti me when reason could be said to be entirely asleep, a stranger to its own exist ence, notwithstanding this apparent materialism. The earliest contemplation of the external wo rld, which brings it into an imagined association with ourselves, assigns, either to its whole or it s parts, the sensation and volition which belong to our own souls. Anaxagoras admitted the existence of ul timate elementary particles, as Empedocles did, from the co mbinations whereof material phenomena resulted. But he asserted the Moving Force to be Mind ; and yet, t hough he clearly saw the impossibility of advancing by illustration or definition beyond a reas onable faith, or a simple negation of materiality, yet he could not wholly desist from the endeavor to illustrate the nature of this non-matter or mind, by symbols drawn from those physical considerations whic h decided him in pl acing it in a separate category. Whether as human reason, or as the regulating Principl e in nature, he held it different from all other thin gs in character and effect, and that theref ore it must necessarily differ in its e ssenticll constitution. It wa s neither Matter , nor a Force conjoined with matter, or homogeneous with it, but i ndependent an d generically distinct, especially in that, being the source of all motion, separatio n, and cognintion it is something entirely un ique, pure, and unmixed; and so, be ing unhindered by any interfering influence limiti ng its independence of individual action , it has Supreme Empire over all things, over t he vortex of worlds as well as over all that live in them. It is most penetrati ng and powerful, mixing with other things, though no other thing mixes with it; exercises universal control and cognition, and includes the Necessity of the Poets, as well as the independent power of thought which we exercise within ourselves. In short, it is the self-conscious power of thought extended to the Universe, and exalted into the Supreme External Mi nd which sees, knows, and directs all things. Thus Pantheism and Materialism were bo th avoided; and matter, though as infinitely varied as the sens es represent it, was held in a bond of unity transferred to a ruling power apart from it. That Power could not be Prime Mover, if it were itself moved; nor All-Govern ing, if not apart fr om the things it gov erns. If the arranging Principle were inherent in matter, it would ha ve been impossible to account for the existence of a chaos: if something exte rnal, then the old I onian doctrine of a"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"\"beginning\" became more easi ly conceivable, as bein g the epoch at which the Arranging Intelligence co mmenced its operations. But this grand idea of an all-governing independent mind in volved difficulties which proved insuperable; because it gave to matter, in the fo rm of chaos, an independent and eternal self-existence, and so introduced a dualism of mind a nd matter. In the Mind or Intelligence, Anaxa goras included not only life and motion, but the moral principles of the noble and good; and probabl y used the term on account of the popular misapplication of the word \"God,\" and as being less liable to misconstruction, and mo re specifically marking his i dea. His \"Intellig ence\" principle remained practically liable to many of the same defects as the \"Necessity\" of the poets. It was the presentiment of a great idea, which it was for the time impossible to explain or follow out. It was not yet intelligible, nor was even the road operled throu which it mi ght be approached. Mind cannot advance in met aphysics beyond self-deificati on. In attemp ting to go further, it only enacts the apotheosis of own subtle conc eptions, and so sinks below the simpler ground already ta ken. The realities which Pl ato could not recognize in phenomena, he discovered with in his own mind, and as unhesitatingly as the old Theosophists installed its creations among the gods. He, like most philosophers after Anaxagoras, made the Su preme Being to be Intelligen ce; but in ot her respects left His nature undefin ed, or rather indefinite through the variety of definitions, a conception vaguely floating between T heism and Pantheism . Though deprecating the demoralizing tendenc ies of poetry, he was too wise to attemp t to replace them by other representat ions of a positive kind. He justly says, that spirit things can be made intelligible only through figures; and the fo rms of allegorical expression which, in a rude age, had been adop ted unconsciously, were designedly chosen by the philosopher as the most appropri ate vehicles for theological ideas. As the devices of symbolism were gradually stri pped away, in order, if possible, to reach the fundamental concepti on, the religious feeling habi tually connec ted with it seemed to evaporate under the process. And yet t he advocates of Monotheism, Xenophanes and Heraclitus, dec laimed only against the ma king of gods in human form. They did not attempt to st rip nature of its divinity, but rather to recall religious contemplation from an ex ploded symbolism to a purer one. They c ontinued the veneration which, in the background of poetry, has been maintained for Sun and Stars, the Fire or Ether. So crates prostrated himself bef ore the rising luminary; and the eternal spheres, which seem to have shared the religious homage of Xenophanes, retained a second ary and qualified Divinity in the Schools of the Peripatetics and Stoics. The unseen being or bein gs revealed only to the In tellect became the theme of philosophy; and their more ancient symbols, if not openly discredited, were passed over with evasive generality, as beings respecting whose problematical existence we must be \"content with what has been r eported by those ancients, who, assuming to be their descen dants, must theref ore be supposed to have been well acquainted with t heir own ancestors and family connections.\" And the Theism of Anaxagoras was still more decidedly subver sive, not only of Myth ology, but of the whole religion of outwa rd nature; it being an appeal from the worl d without, to the consciousness of spiritua l dignity within man."},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"In the doctrines of Aristotl e, the world moves on uninterruptedly, always changing, yet ever the same, like Time , the Eternal Now, knowing neither repose nor death. There is a principle which makes good th e failure of identity, by multiplying resemblances; the destruction of the individual by an eterna l renewal of the form in which matter is manifested. This regular eternal move ment implies an Eternal Mover; not an inert Eternity, such as the Platonic Ei dos, but one always acting, His essence being to act, for ot herwise he might never have ac ted, and the existence of the world would be an accide nt; for what should have, in that case, de cided Him to act, after long inactivity? No r can He be partly in act and partly potential, that is, quiescent and undetermin ed to act or not to act, for even in t hat case motion would not be eternal, but c ontingent and precarious. He is therefore wholly in act, a pure, untiring activity, and for the same reasons wholly immateri al. Thus Aristotle avoided the idea that God was inactive and self-cont emplative for an eternity, and then for some unknown reason, or by some unkno wn motive, commenced to act outwardly and produce; but he incurred the opposite haz ard, of making th e result of His action, matter and the Universe , be coexistent with Himself; or, in other words, of denying that there was an y time when His outw ard action commenced. The First Cause, he said, unmoved, moves al l. Act was first, and the Universe has existed forever; one persiste nt cause directing its contin uity. The unity of the First Mover follows from His immateri ality. If He were not Hims elf unmoved, the series of motions and causes of moti on would be infinite. Un moved, therefore, and unchangeable Himself, all movement, even that in space, is caused by Him: He is necessary: He cannot be ot herwise than as He is; and it is only through the necessity of His being that we can account for those necessary eternal relations which make a science of Bei ng possible. Thus Aristotl e leaned to a seemingly personal God; not a Being of parts and passions, like th e God of the Hebrews, or that of the mass even of e ducated men in our own day, but a Substantial Head of all the categories of being, an Individuality of In telligence, the dogma of Anaxagoras revived out of a more elabo rate and profound analysis of Nature; something like that living unambiguous Prin ciple which the old poets in advance of the materialistic cosmogonists from Night a Chaos, had discovered in Ouranos or Zeus. Soon, however, the vision of person ality is withdrawn, and we reach that culminating point of thought where the real blends with the ideal; where moral action and objective thought (that is, thought exer cised to anything outside of itself), as well as the material body, a excluded; and where the divine action in the world retains veil of impenetrable mystery, and to the utmost ingenuity resear ch presents but a contradiction. At this extreme, the series of efficient caus es resolves itself into the Final Cause. That which move s, itself unmoved, can only be the immobility Thought or Form. God is both formal , efficient, and final cause; the One Form comprising all forms, the one good in cluding good, the goal of the longing of the University, moving the world as the object of love or rational desire moves the indivi dual. He is the internal or self-r ealized Final Cause, having no end beyond Himself. He is no moral agent; for if He were, He would be but an instrum ent for producing something still higher and greater . One sort of act only, activi ty of mind or thought, can be assigned to Him who is at once all act yet all repose. What we call our highest pleasure, which distinguis hes wakefulness and sens ation and which gives a reflected charm to hope and memory, is with Him perpetual. His existence is unbroken enjoyment of that which is most excellent bu t only temporary with us. The divine quality of active and yet tranquil self-contem plation characterizing"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"intelligence, is pre-eminen tly possessed by the divine mind; His thought, which is His existence, being, unlike ours, unconditional and wholly act. If He can receive any gratification or enjoyment from that which exists be yond Himself, He can also be displeased and pained with it, and then He would be an imperfect being. To suppose pleasure experienc ed by Him from anything out ward, supposes insufficient prior enjoyment and happiness, and a sort of dependency. Man' s Good is beyond himself; not so God's. The et ernal act which produces the world's life is the eternal desire of good. The object of the Absolute Thought is the Absolute Good. Nature is all movement, and Thought al l repose. In contemplatin g that absolute good, the Finality can contemplate on ly itself; and thus, all ma terial interference being excluded, the distinction of subject and object vanishes in complete identification, and the Divine Thought is \"the thinking of thought.\" The energy of mind is life, and God is that energy in its purit y and perfection. He is theref ore life itself, eternal and perfect; and this sums up all that is meant by the term \"God.\" And yet, after all this transcendentalism, the ve ry essence of thought consists in its mobilit y and power of transference from object to object; and we can co nceive of no t hought, with out an object beyond itself, about whic h to think, or of any activity in mere self- contemplation, without outward act, movement, or manifestation. Plato endeavors to show how the Divine Principle of Good becomes realized in Nature: Aristotle's system is a vast analogical inductio n to prove how all Nature tends toward a final good. Plato consider ed Soul as a principl e of movement, and made his Deity realize, that is, turn into realities, his ideas as a free, intelligent Force. Aristotle, for whom Soul is the motionl ess centre from wh ich motion radiates, and to which it converges, conceives a correspondingly un moved God. The Deity of Plato creates, superintends, an d rejoices in the universal joy of, His crea tures. That of Aristotle is the perfection of man's intellectual activi ty extended to the Universe. When he makes the Deity to be an eternal ac t of self-contemplatio n, the world is not excluded from His cognizance, for He contemplates it wi thin Himself. Apart from and beyond the world, He yet m ysteriously intermingles with it. He is universal as well as individual; His agenc y is necessary and general, yet also makes the real and the good of the particular. When Plato had given to the unformed world the anima l life of the Ionians, and added to that the Anaxagore an Intelligence, overruli ng the wild principle of Necessity; and when to Intelligenc e was added Benefic ence; and the dread Wardours, Force and Strength, were made subordinate to Mildness and Goodness, it seemed as if a further advance were impossible, and that the Deity could not be more than The Wise and The Good. But the contemplation of the Good implies that of its opp osite, Evil. When God is held to be \"The Good,\" it is not because Evil is unkn own, but because it is designedly excluded from His attributes. But if Evil be a separate and independent existence, how would it fare with His prerogative of Un ity and Supremacy? To meet this dilemma, it remained onl y to fall back on something more or less akin to the vagueness of antiquity; to make a virtua l confession of igno rance, to deny the ultimate reality of evil, like Plato and Aristotle, or, with Speusippus, the eternity of its antithetical existence, to su rmise that it is only one of those notions which are indeed provisionally i ndispensable in a condition of fini te knowledge, but of which so many have been al ready discredited by the advance of philosophy; to revert, in"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"short, to the original concept ion of \"The Absolute,\" or of a single Be ing, in whom all mysteries are explain ed, and before w hom the disturbing prin ciple is reduced to a mere turbid spot on the ocean of Eternity, which to the eye of faith may be said no longer to exist. But the absolute is nearly allied to the non-existen t. Matter and evil obtruded themselves too constantly and convincingly to be confuted or cancelled by subtleties of Logic. It is in vain to attempt to merge the world in Go d, while the world of experience exhibits cont rariety, imperfection, and mutability, instead of the immutability of its source . Philosophy was but another name for uncertainty; and after the mind had successively deified Nature and its ow n conceptions, without any practical result but toilsome occupation; wh en the reality it sought, without or within, seemed ever to elude its gras p, the intelle ct, baffled in its hig her flights, sought advantage and repose in aiming at truth of a lower bu t more applicable kind. The Deity of Plato is a Be ing proportioned to human sympathies; th e Father of the World, as well as it s Creator; the author of good only, not of ev il. \"Envy,\" he says, \"is far removed from celestia l beings, and man, if willing, and braced for the effort, is permitted to aspire to a communion with the solemn troops and sweet societies of Heaven. God is the Idea or Essence of G oodness, the Good itse lf: in goodness, He created the World, and gave to it the greatest perfection of which it was susceptible; making it, as far as possibl e, an image of Himself. The sublime type of all excellence is an object not only of veneration but love .\" The Sages of old had already intimated in enigmas that God is the Author of Good; that lik e the Sun in Heaven, or AEsculapius on earth, He is \"Healer,\" \"S aviour,\" and \"Redeemer,\" the destroyer and averter of Ev il, ever healing the mischie fs inflicted by Here, the wanton or irrational power of nature. Plato only asserts with more distinctness the dogm a of antiquity when he recognizes Love as the highes t and most beneficent of gods, who gives to nature the invigorating energy restor ed by the art of medicine to the body; since Love is emphatically the physician of the Universe, the AEscula pius to whom Socrates wished to sacrifice in the hour of his death. A figurative idea, adopted from familiar im agery, gave that endear ing aspect to the divine connection with the Universe which had command ed the earliest assent of the sentiments, until, rising in refinement with the progress of mental cultivation, it ultimately established itself as firmly in the deliberate approbation of the understanding, as it had ever respo nded to the sympath ies. Even the rude Scythians, Bithynians, and Scandinavians, called God their \"Father\"; all nations traced their ancestry more or less direct ly to Heaven. The Hyperborean Olen, one of the oldest symbols of the religious antiquity of Greece , made Love the First born of Nature. Who will ventur e to pronounce at what time God was firs t worthily and truly honored, or when man fi rst began to feel aright th e mute eloquence of nature? In the obscure physics of the mystical Theologers who precede d Greek philosophy, Love was the Great Firs t Cause and Parent of the Un iverse. \"Zeus,\" says Proclus, \"when entering upon the work of creation, changed Hi mself into the form of Love: and He brought forward Aphrodite, the princi ple of Unity and Un iversal Harmony, to display her light to all. In the depths of His mysteri ous being, He contains the principle of love within Himself; in Him creative wi sdom and blessed love are"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"united.\" \"From the first Of Days on these his lo ve divine be fixed, His admiration; till in time complete What he admire d and loved, hi s vital smile Unfolded into being.\" The speculators of the venerable East, w ho had conceived the idea of an Eternal Being superior to all a ffection and change, in hi s own sufficiency enjoying a plenitude of sere ne and independent bl iss, were led to inqu ire into the apparently inconsistent fact of the crea tion of the world. Why, they asked, did He, who required nothing external to Himself to complete Hi s already existing Perfection, come forth out of His unreveal ed and perfect existence, and bec ome incorporated in the vicissitudes of nature? The solution of th e difficulty was Love. The Great Being beheld the beauty of His ow n conception, which dwelt with Him alone from the beginning, Maia, or Nature's lo veliness, at once the germ of passion and the source of worlds. Love became th e universal parent, when the Deity, before remote and inscrutable, became idea lly separated into the loving and the beloved. And here again recurs the an cient difficulty; that, at wh atever early period this creation occurred, an eternity had previously elaps ed, during which God, dwelling alone in His unimpeac hed unity, had no ob ject for His love; and that the very word implies to us an existing object toward whic h the love is directed ; so that we cannot conceive of love in the abs ence of any object to be loved; and therefore we again return to this point, that if love is of God's essence, and He is unchangeable, the same necessity of His natur e, supposed to have caused creation, must ever have made His existence without an object to lo ve impossible: and so that the Universe must have been co-exi stent with Himself. The questions how and why evil exists in the Universe: how its existence is to be reconciled with the admitted wisdom and goodness and omnipote nce of God; and how far man is a free agent, or controlled by an inexorab le necessity or destiny, have two sides. On one, they are questions as to the qualities a nd attributes of God; for we must infer His moral nature from His mode of gov erning the Universe, and they ever enter in to any consideration His intellec tual nature: an d on the other, they directly concern the mora l responsibility, and therefor e the destiny, of man. All important, therefore, in bot h points of view, they have been much discussed in all ages of the world, and have no doubt urge d men, more than al l other questions have, to endeavor to fathom the profound myster ies of the Nature and the mode of Existence and action of an incomprehensible God. And, with these, still an other question also presents itself: whether the Deity governs the Universe by fixe d and unalterable la ws, or by special Providences and interferences, so that He may be induced to change His course and th e results of"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"human or material action, by prayer and supplication. God alone is all-powerful; but the human soul has in all ages asserted its claim to be considered as part of the Di vine. \"The purity of the sp irit,\" says Van Helmont, \"is shown through energy and effi caciousness of will . God, by the agen cy of an infinite will, created the Univ erse, and the same sort of power in an infe rior degree, limited more or less by external hindrances, exists in all spiritual bei ngs.\" The higher we ascend in antiquity, the more does prayer take the form of incantation; and that form it still in a great degree retains, since the rites of public worship are generally considered not merely as an ex pression of trust or reverenc e, as real spiritual acts, the effect of which is looked for only within the mind of the worshipper, but as acts from which some direct out ward result is anticipated, the attainment of some desired object, of health or wealth, of supernatural gi fts for body or soul, of exemption from danger, or vengeance upon enem ies. Prayer was able to change the purposes of Heaven, and to make the Devs trem ble under the abyss. It exercised a compulsory in fluence over the gods. It promoted the magnetic sympathy of spirit with spirit; and the Hindu and Pe rsian liturgies, addressed not only to the Deity Himself, but to His diversified mani festations, were considered wholesome and necessary iter ations of the living or cr eative Word which at first effectuated the divine will, an d which from instant to in stant supports the universal frame by its eter nal repetition. In the narrative of t he Fall, we have the H ebrew mode of explai ning the great moral mystery, the origin of evil and the appa rent estrangement fr om Heaven; and a similar idea, variously modi fied, obtained in al l the ancient creeds. Everywhere, man had at the beginni ng been innocent and happy, and had lapsed, by temptation and his own weakness, from his first estate. Thus wa s accounted for the presumed connection of increase of knowledge with increase of mi sery, and, in particular, the great penalty of deat h was reconciled with Divine Ju stice. Subordinate to these greater points were the questions, Why is the earth covered with thorns and weeds ? whence the origin of clothing, of sexual sh ame and passion? whence the infliction of labor, a nd how to justify the d egraded condition of wo man in the East, or account for the loathing so generally felt towa rd the Serpent Tribe? The hypothesis of a fall, r equired under some of its modifications in all systems, to account for the apparent imperfection in t he work of a Perfec t Being, was, in Eastern philosophy, the unavo idable accompanim ent and condition of limited or individual existence; sinc e the Soul, considered as a fragment of the Universal Mind, might be said to ha ve lapsed from its pre-emi nence when pa rted from its source, and ceasing to form part of integral pe rfection. The theory of its reunion was correspondent to the assumed cause of its degradation. To reach its prior condition its individuality must ceas e; it must be emanc ipated by re-absorption into the Infinite, the consummation of all things in God, to be promoted by hu man effortin spiritual meditation or se lf-mortification, and co mpleted in the magical transformation of death. And as man had fallen, so it was held that the Angels of Evil had, from their first estate, to which, like men, they were, in God's good time, to be restored, and the reign of evil was then to cease forever. To this gr eat result a ll the Ancient Theologies point; and t hus they all endeavored to reco ncile the existence of Sin and"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"Evil with the perfect and undeniable wisdom and beneficence of God. With man's exercise of thought are in separably connected freedom and responsibility. Man assumes his proper rank as a mora l agent, when with a sense of the limitations of his nature arise the consciou sness of freedom, and of the obligations accompanyi ng its exercise, the sense of duty and of the capacity to perform it. To suppose that man ever imagin ed himself not to be a free agent until he had argued himself into th at belief, would be to su ppose that he was in that below the brutes; for he, like them, is conscious of hi s freedom to act. Experience alone teaches him that this freedom of action is limite d and controlled; and when what is outward to him rest rains and limits this freedom of action, he instinctively rebels against it as a wron g. The rule of duty and the ma terials of experience are derived from an acquaintance wi th the conditions of the external world, in which the faculties are exerted; and thus the problem of man involves th ose of Nature and God. Our freedom, we learn by experience, is determ ined by an agency external to us; our happiness is intimate ly dependent on t he relations of t he outward World, and on the moral charac ter of its Ruler. Then at once arises this problem: The God of Nature must be One, and His character cannot be suspect ed to be other than good. Whence, then, came the evil, the consciousness of which must in va riably have preceded or accompanied man's moral development? On this subject human opinion ha s ebbed and flowed between two contradictory extremes , one of which seems in consistent with God's Omnipotence, and the other wi th His beneficence. If God it was said, is perfectly wise and good, evil must aris e from some independ ent and hostile principle: if, on the other hand, all agencies are subord inate to One, it is difficult, if evil does indeed exist, if there is any such thing as Evil, to avoid th e impiety of making God the Author of it. The recognition of a moral and physical dualism in na ture was adverse to the doctrine of Divine Unity. Ma ny of the Ancients thought it absurd to imagine one Supreme Being, like Homer's Jove, distributing go od and evil out of two urns. They therefore substituted, as we have seen, the doctrine of two di stinct and eternal principles; some making the c ause of evil to be the inhere nt imperfection of matter and the flesh, wit hout explaining how Go d was not the cause of that; while others personified the requir ed agency, and fancifully inve nted an Evil Principle, the question of whose origin indeed involved all the difficulty of the original problem, but whose existence, if once ta ken for granted, was sufficie nt as a popular solution of the mystery; the difficul ty being supposed no longer to exist when pushed a step further off, as the difficulty of concei ving the world upheld by an elephant was supposed to be got ri d of when it was said that t he elephant was su pported by a tortoise. The simpler, and probably the older, notion, treated the one only God as the Author of all things. \"I form the light,\" sa ys Jehovah, \"and creat e darkness; I cause prosperity and create evil; I, the Lord, do all these things.\" \"All mankind,\" says Maximus Tyrius, \"are agreed t hat there exists one only Universal King and Father, and that the many gods are His Children.\" There is nothing improbable in the supposition that the primitiv e idea was that there was but one God. A vague sense of Nature's Unity, blend ed with a dim perception of an all-pervading Spiritual"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"Essence, has been remarked among the earliest mani festations of the Human Mind. Everywhere it was t he dim remembrance, uncertain and indefinite, of the original truth taught by God to the first men. The Deity of the Old Testamen t is everywhere represente d as the dire ct author of Evil, commissioning evil and lying spirits to men, hardening the heart of Pharaoh, and visiting the iniquity of the individual sinner on the whole people. The rude conception of sternnes s predominating over mercy in the Deity, can alone account for the human sacrifices, pu rposed, if not exec uted, by Abraham and Jephthah. It has not been uncommon, in an y age or country of the wo rld, for men to recognize the existence of one God, without forming any becoming estimate of His dignity. The causes of both good and il l are referred to a myster ious centre, to which each assigns such attributes as correspond with his own intellect and advance in civilization. Hence the assignm ent to the Deity of the feel ings of envy and jealousy. Hence the provocation given by the heal ing skill of AEscula pius and the humane theft of fire by Prometheu s. The very spirit of Na ture, personifi ed in Orpheus, Tantalus, or Phineus was su pposed to have been killed, co nfined, or blinded, for having too freely divulged the Divine Myster ies to mankind. This Divine Envy still exists in a modified form, and varies according to circ umstances. In Hesiod it appears in the lowe st type of human malignity. In the God of Moses, it is jealousy of the infringement of the autocratic power, the check to political tr eason; and even the penalties denounced for worshi pping other gods often seem dictated rather by a jealous regard for His own greatness in Deity, than by the immorality and degraded nature of the worship itself . In Herodotus and other writers it assumes a more philosophical shape, as a strict adherenc e to a moral equilibrium in the government of the world, in the punis hment of pride, arrogance, and insolent pretension. God acts providentially in Na ture by regular a nd universal laws, by constant modes of operation; a nd so takes care of mate rial things without viol ating their constitution, acting always according to the nature of the things which He has made. It is a fact of observation that, in the material and unconscious world, He works by its materiality and unconsciousne ss, not against them; in th e animal world, by its animality and partial consci ousness, not against them. So in the providential government of the world, He acts by regular and universal laws, and constant modes of operation; and so takes care of human things wit hout violating their constitution, acting always according to the human natur e of man, no t against it, working in the human world by means of man's conscious ness and partial freedom, not against them. God acts by general laws fo r general purposes. The attraction of gravitation is a good thing, for it keeps the world together; and if the tower of Sil oam, thereby falling to the ground slays eighteen me n of Jerusalem, that number is too small to think of, considering the myriad millio ns who are upheld by the sa me law. It could not well be repealed for their sake , and to hold up that tower; nor could it remain in force, and the tower stand. It is difficult to conceive of a Perfect Will wi thout confounding it with something like mechanism; since language has no name for that combin ation of the Inexorable with the Moral, which the ol d poets personified separatel y in Ananke or Eimarmene and Zeus.

For all that we familiarly know of Free-Will is that caprici ous exercise of it which we experience in ourselves and other men; and th erefore the notion of Supreme Will, still guided by Infallible Law, even if that law be self-im posed, is always in danger of being either stripped of t he essential quality of Fre edom, or degraded under the ill- name of Necessity to someth ing of even less moral and in tellectual di gnity than the fluctuating course of human operations. It is not until we elev ate the idea of law a bove that of partiality or tyranny, that we discover that the self-impos ed limitations of the Supr eme Cause, constituting an array of certain alternativ es, regulating moral choice, are the very sources and safeguards of human freedom; and the doubt re curs, whether we do not set a law above God Himself; or whether laws self-imposed may not be self-repealed: and if not, what power prevents it. The Zeus of Homer, like that of Hesiod, is an array of an titheses, combining strength with weak ness, wisdom with folly, universa l parentage with narrow family limitation, omnipotent control over events with submi ssion to a superior destiny,-- DESTINY, a name by means of which the theological problem was cast back into the original obscurity out of which the powers of the human mind have proved themselves as incapable of rescuing it, as the efforts of a fly caught in a spider's web to do more than in crease its entanglement. The oldest notion of Deity was rather indefin ite than repulsive. The positive degradation was of later growth . The God of nature reflects the ch angeful character of the seasons, varying fr om dark to bri ght. Alternately angr y and serene, and lavishing abundance which sh e again withdraws , nature seems inexplicably capricious, and though capable of responding to th e highest requir ements of the moral sentiment through a ge neral comprehension of her mysteries, more liable by a partial or hasty vi ew to become darkened into a Si va, a Saturn, or a Mexitli, a patron of fierce orgies or bl ood-stained altars. All the ol der poetical personifications exhibit traces of this ambiguity. They are neither wholly immoral nor purely beneficent. No people have ever deliberately made their Deity a male volent or guilty Being. The simple piety which ascribed t he origin of all things to God, took all in good part, trusting and hopi ng all things. The Supreme Ruler wa s at first looked up to with unquestioning reverence. No st artling discords or contradi ctions had yet raised a doubt as to His beneficence, or made men dissatisfied wi th His government. Fear might cause anxiety, but coul d not banish hope, still less inspire aversion. It was only later, when abstract no tions began to assume the se mblance of realities, and"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"when new or more distinct ideas suggested new words for their expr ession, that it became necessary to fix a definite barrier between Evil and Good. To account for moral evil , it became necessary to devise some new expedient suited both to the piet y and self-complacency of the inv entor, such as the perversity of woman, or an agent distinct from God, a Typhon or Ahriman, obtai ned either by dividing the Gods into tw o classes, or by dethroning the Ancient Divinity, and changing him into a Dev or Daemon. Through a similar wa nt, the Orientals devised the inherent corruption of the fleshy and material; t he Hebrew transferred to Satan everything illegal and immoral; and the Greek reflecti on, occasionally adopting the older and truer view, retorted upon man the obloquy cast on these creatures of his imagination, and showed how he has to thank himself alo ne for his calamities, while his good things are the vo luntary gifts, not the plund er of Heaven. Homer had already made Zeus exclaim, in the Assembly of Olympus, \"Grievous it is to hear these mortals accuse the G ods; they pretend that evil s come from us; but they themselves occasion them grat uitously by their own wanton folly.\" \"I t is the fault of man,\" said Solon; in referenc e to the social evils of hi s day, \"not of God, that destruction comes;\" and Euripi des, after a formal discussion of the origin of evil, comes to the conclusion that men act wrongly, not from wa nt of natural good sense and feeling, but because knowi ng what is good, they yet for various re asons neglect to practise it. And at last reaching the highest truth, Pi ndar, Hesiod, AEsch ylus, AEsop, and Horace said, \"All virtue is a struggle; life is not a scene of repose, but of energetic action. Suffering is but another name for th e teaching of expe rience, appointed by Zeus himself, the giver of all understanding, to be the parent of instruction, the schoolmaster of life. He i ndeed put an end to t he golden age; he gave venom to serpents and predacity to wo lves; he shook the honey from the leaf, and stopped the flow of wine in the ri vulets; he concealed the elem ent of fire, and made the means of life scanty and precarious. But in all this his object was beneficent; it was not to destroy life, but to im prove it. It was a blessing to man, not a curse, to be sentenced to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow; for nothin g great or excellent is attainable without exerti on; safe and easy virtues are prized neither by gods nor men; and the parsimoniousness of nature is justified by it s powerful effect in rousing the dormant faculties, and forcing on manki nd the invention of useful arts by means of meditation and thought.\" Ancient religious reformers pr onounced the worship of \"idol s\" to be the root of all evil; and there have been many iconoclast s in different ages of the world. The maxim still holds good ; for the worship of idols, that is, of fanc iful conceits , if not the source of all evil, is still the cause of much ; and it prevails as extensively now as it ever did. Men are ever enga ged in worshipping the pictur esque fancies of their own imaginations. Human wisdom must always be limited and in correct; and even right opinion is only a something intermedi ate between ignorance and knowledge. The normal condition of man is that of progress. Philosophy is a ki nd of journey, ever learning, yet never arriving at the ideal perfecti on of truth. A Mason should, like the wise Socrates, assume the modest title of a \"lover of wisdom;\" fo r he must ever long after something more exce llent than he possesses, someth ing still beyond his reach,"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"which he desires to make eternally his own. Thus the philosophic sentiment came to be associated with the poetical and the religious, under the comprehens ive name of Love. Before the birth of Philosophy, Love had received but scant y and inadequate homage. This mightiest and most ancient of gods, coeval with the existence of religion and of the wo rld, had been indeed unconsciously felt, bu t had neither b een worthily honour ed nor directly celebrated in hymn or pae an. In the old days of igno rance it could scarcely have been recognized. In order that it might exercise its pr oper influence over religion and philosophy, it was necessary that the God of Nature should cease to be a God of terrors, a personificati on of mere Power or arbi trary Will, a pure and stern Intelligence, an inflictor of ev il, and an unrelent ing Judge. The phil osophy of Plato, in which this charge became forever established, was em phatically a mediation of Love. With him, the inspirati on of Love first kindled the light of arts and imparted them to mankind; and not only the arts of mere existenc e, but the hea venly art of wisdom, which supports the Universe. It inspires high a nd generous deeds and noble self devotion. Without it, neither State nor indivi dual could do anything beautiful or great. Love is our best pilot, confederate, supporter, and saviour; the ornament and governor of al l things human and divine; and he wi th divine harmony forever soothes the mi nds of men and gods. Man is capable of a higher Love, which, marrying mind with mind and with the Universe, brings forth all that is noblest in his faculties, and lifts him beyond himself. This higher love is neither mortal nor immortal, but a power intermediate between the human and the Divi ne, filling up the mighty interval, an binding the Universe together. He is chief of th ose celestial emissaries who carry to the gods the prayers of men, and bring do wn to men the gifts of the gods. \"He is forever poor, and far from being beautiful as mankind imagine, for he is s qualid and wither ed; he flies low along the ground, is homele ss and unsandalled; sleepi ng without covering before the doors and in the unsheltered streets, and possessi ng so far his mother's nature as being ever the companion of want. Yet, sharing also that of his father, he is forever scheming to obtain things good and beautiful; he is fearless, vehement, and strong; always devising some new contrivance strictly cautious a nd full of inventive resource; a philosopher throu gh his whole existence, a powerful enchanter, and a subtle sophist.\" The ideal consummation of Platonic science is the arrival at th e contemplation of that of which earth exhibits no express image or adequate simi litude, the Supreme Prototype of all beauty, pure and uncontaminated with human interm ixture of flesh or colour, the Divine Origin al itself. To one so qualified is given the prerogative of bringing forth not mere images and shadows of virtue, but virtue itself, as having been conversant not with sh adows, but with the truth; and having so brought forth and nurtured a progeny of virtue, he becomes t he friend of God, a nd, so far as such a privilege can belong to any human being, immortal. Socrates believed, like Hera clitus, in a Universal Reas on pervading all things and all minds, and consequently re vealing itself in ideas. He therefore sought truth in general opinion, and perceive d in the communication of mind with mind one of the greatest prerogatives of wi sdom and the most powerful means of advancement. He believed true wisdom to be an attainable idea, and that the mo ral convictions of the"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"mind, those eternal instin cts of temperance, consci entiousness, and justice, implanted in it by the gods, could not deceive, if rightly interpreted. This metaphysical direction given to philosoph y ended in visionar y extravagance. Having assumed truth to be discoverable in thought, it proceeded to treat thoughts as truths. It thus became an idolatry of notio ns, which it considered either as phantoms exhaled from objects, or as portions of the divine preexistent thought; this creating a mythology of its own, and escaping from one thraldom only to enslave itself afresh. Theories and notions indiscriminately fo rmed and defen ded are the false gods or \"idols\" of phi losophy. For the word idol on means image, and a false mind-picture of God is as much an idol as a false w ooden image of Hi m. Fearlessly launching into the problem of universal being, the fi rst philosophy attempted to supply a compendious and decisive soluti on of every doubt. To do this, it was obliged to make the most sweeping assumptions ; and as poetry ha d already filled the vast void between the hum an and the divine, by person ifying its Deity as man, so philosophy bowed down be fore the supposed reflection of the divine image in the mind of the inquirer, who, in wors hipping his own noti ons, had unconsciously deified himself. Nature thus was enslav ed to common notions, and notions very often to words. By the clashing of incompat ible opinions, philosophy wa s gradually re duced to the ignominious confession of utte r incapacity, and f ound its check or intellectual fall in skepticism. Xenophanes and Heraclitus mournful ly acknowledged the unsatisfactory result of al l the struggles of philosophy , in the admission of a universality of doubt; and the memorable effort of Socr ates to rally the discomfited champions of truth, ended in a similar confession. The worship of abstractions continued the erro r which personifie d Evil or deified Fortune; and when m ystical philosophy resigned its pl ace to mystical religion, it changed not its nature, but on ly its name. The great task remained unperformed, of reducing the outward world and its principles to the dominio n of the intellect, and of reconciling the conception of the supreme unalterable power asserted by reason, with the requisitions of human sympathies. A general idea of purpos e and regularity in nature had been suggested by common appearances to the earliest re flection. The ancients perc eived a natural order, a divine legislation, from whic h human institutions were s upposed to be derived, laws emblazoned in Heaven, and thence revealed to earth. But the divine law was little more than an analogical inference from hum an law, taken in the vulgar sense of arbitrary will or partial co venant. It was surmised rat her than discovered, and remained unmoral because uninte lligible. It mattered litt le, under the circumstances, whether the Universe were sa id to be governed by chanc e or by reason, since the latter, if misunderstood, was virtually one wi th the former. \"Better far,\" said Epicurus, \"acquiesce in the fables of tradition, than acknowledge the oppressive necessity of the physicists\"; and M enander speaks of G od, Chance, and Intelligence as undistingui shable. Law unacknow ledged goes under the name of Chance: perceived, but not understood, it becomes Nece ssity. The wisdom of the Stoic was a dogged su bmission to the ar bitrary behests of one; that of the Epicurean an advantage snatched by more or less dexterous management from the equal tyranny of the other."},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"Ignorance sees nothing nece ssary, and is self abandoned to a po wer tyrannical because defined by no rule, and paradoxic al because permitting evil, while itself assumed to be unli mited, all power ful, and perfectly go od. A little knowledge, presuming the identification of the Suprem e Cause with the inev itable certainty of perfect reason, but omitting the analysis or interpretati on of it, leaves the mind chain-bound in the asceti c fatalism of the Stoic. Free- will, coupled with the universal rule of Chance; or Fatalism and Necessi ty, coupled with Omni science and fixed and unalterable Law,--these are the alternatives, between which the hum an mind has eternally vacillated. The Su pernaturalists, contemplati ng a Being acting through impulse, though with superhum an wisdom, and considering th e best courtier to be the most favored subject, co mbines contradictory expedi ents, inconsistently mixing tlle assertion of free action with the enervating service of petition; wh ile he admits, in the words of a lear ned archbishop, that \"i f the production of th e things we ask for depend on antecedent, nat ural, and necessary causes , our desires will be answered no less by the omissi on than the offering of pray ers, which, therefore, are a vain thing.\" The last stage is that in which the religion of action is made legitimate through comprehension of its proper objects and c ontiditions. Man beco mes morally free only when both notions, that of Chance and that of incomprehen sible Necessity, are displaced by that of Law. Law, as applied to the Universe , means that universal, providential pre-arrangement , whose conditions can be di scerned and discretionally acted on by human intelligenc e. The sense of freedom ar ises when the individual independence develops it self according to its own laws , without exter nal collisions or hindrance; that of constrai nt, where it is thwa rted or confi ned by other Natures, or where, by combinati on of external forces, the indivi dual force is compelled into a new direction. Moral choice would not exist safely, or ev en at all, unless it were bounded by conditions determining its preferences. Duty supposes a rule both intelligible and certain, sinc e an uncertain rule would be unintelligible, and if unintelligible, there could be no responsibility. No law that is unknown can be obligatory; and that Roma n Emperor was justly exec rated, who pr etended to promulgate his penal laws, by putting them up at such a height that none could read them. Man commands results, only by selecting among the cont ingent the pre-ordained results most suited to his purposes. In regard to ab solute or divine morality, meaning the final cause or purpose of those comprehensiv e laws which often seem harsh to the individual, bec ause inflexibly just and im partial to the universal, speculation must take refu ge in faith; the immediat e and obvious purpose often bearing so small a proportion to a wider and unknown one, as to be relatively absorbed or lost. The rain that, unseasonable to me , ruins my hopes of an abundant crop, does so because it could not otherwise have bl essed and prospered the crops of another kind of a whole neighbo ring district of c ountry. The obvious purpose of a sudden st orm of snow, or an unexpected change of wind, exposed to which I lose my life, bears sm all proportion to th e great results which are to flow from that storm or win d over a whole conti nent.

Self-restraint is found not to imply self-sacrifice.

Science with her many instruments, Astronomy, particularly, with he r telescope, Physics with the micr oscope, and Chemistry with its analyses and combinations, have greatly enlarged our i deas of the Deity, by discovering to us the vast ex tent of the Universe in bot h directions, its star-systems and its invisible swarms of minutest animal life; by acquai nting us with the new and wonderful Force or Substance we call Electricity, apparent ly a link between Matter and Spirit: and still the Deity only beco mes more incomprehensi ble to us than ever, and we find that in our speculations we but reprodu ce over and over again the Ancient Thought. Where, then, amid all these conflicting opinions, is t he True Word of a Mason? My Brother, most of the ques tions which have thus tortur ed men's minds, it is not within the reach and grasp of the Huma n Intellect to understand; but without understanding, as we have ex plained to you heretofore, we may and must believe. The True Word of a Mason is to be found in the concealed and profound meaning of the Ineffable Name of Deity, communicated by God to Moses; and which meaning was long lost by the very pr ecautions taken to conceal it. The true pronunciation of that was in truth a secret, in which, ho wever, was involved the far"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"more profound secret of it s meaning. In that meaning is included all the truth than can be known by us, in regard to the nature of God. Long known as AL, AL SC HADAI, ALOHAYIM, and AD ONAI; as the Chief or Commander of the Heavenly Armies; as th e aggregate of the Fo rces [ALOHAYIM] of Nature; as the Mighty, the Victorious, the Riva l of Bal and Osiris ; as the Soul of Nature, Nature itself, a God that was but Man pers onified, a God with human passions, the God of the Heat hen with but a mere change of name, He assumes, in His communications to Moses, the nam e IHUH, and says to Him, AHIH ASHR AHIH, I AM WHAT I AM. Let us examine the esoteric or in ner, meaning of this Ineffable Name. HIH is the imperfect tense of the verb TO BE, of which IH IH] is the present; [AHI-- being the personal pronoun \"I \" affixed the first person, by apocope; and IHI the third. The verb has the following forms : . . . Preterite, 3d person, masculine singular, HIH, did exist, wa s; 3d person com. plural, HIU . . . Present, 3d pers. masc. sing. IHIH, once IHUA , by apocope AHI, IHI . . Infinitive, HIH, HIU . . . Imperative, 2d pers. masc sing . HIH, fem. HUI . . . Part iciple, masc. sing. HUH, ENS - EXISTING . . EXISTENCE. The verb is never used, as the mere l ogical copula or connec ting word, is, was, etc., is used with the Gree ks, Latins, and ourselves. It always implies existence, actuality. The present form also includes the future sense, . . shall or may be or exist. And HUH and HUA Chalda ic forms of the imperfect tense of the verb, are the same as the Hebrew HUH and HIH, and mean was, existed, became. Now HUA and HIA are the Pe rsonal Pronoun [Masculine and Feminine], HE, SHE. Thus in Gen. iv. 20 we ha ve the phrase, HUA HIH, HE WAS: and in Lev. xxi. 9, ATH ABIH HIA, HER Father. This feminine pronoun, howeve r, is often written HUA, and HIA occurs only eleven ti mes in the Pentateuch. So metimes the feminine form means IT; but that pronoun is generally in t he masculine form. When either Yod, Vav, He, or Aleph term inates a word, and has no vowel either immediately preceding or follow ing it, it is often rejected; as in GI, for GIA, a valley. So HUA-HIA, He-She, could properly be written HU-HI; or by transposition of the letters, common with the Talmudists, IH-UH, which is th e Tetragrammaton or Ineffable Name. In Gen. i. 27, it is said, \"So the ALHIM created man in His im age: in the image of ALHIM created He him: MALE and FEMALE created He them.\" Sometimes the word was thus expressed; triangularly: "},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"And we learn that this desi gnation of the Ineffable Name was, among the Hebrews, a symbol of Creati on. The mysterious un ion of God with His creatures was in the letter , which they considered to be the A gent of Almighty Powe r; and to enable the possessor of t he Name to work miracles. The Personal Pronoun HUA, HE, is often used by itself, to express t he Deity. Lee says that in such cases, IH UH, IH, or ALHIM, or some other name of God, is understood; but ther e is no necessity fo r that. It means in such cases the Male, Generative, or Creative Principle or Power. It was a common prac tice with the Talmudists to conceal secret meanings and sounds of words by trans posing the letters. The reversal of t he letters of words was, indeed, anciently common everywhere. Thus from Neitha, the name of an Egyptian Goddess, t he Greeks, writing backward, formed Athene, the name of Mine rva. In Arabic we have Nahid, a name of the planet Venus, which, revers ed, gives Dihan, Greek, in Persian, Nihad, Nature; which Sir William Jones writes also Nahid. Strabo info rms us that the Armenian name of Venus was Anaitis. Tien, Heaven, in Chinese, reve rsed, is Neit, or Neith, wo rshipped at Sais in Egypt. Reverse Neitha, drop the i, and add an e, and we, as before said, Athene. Mitra was the name of Venus among t he ancient Persians. Herodo tus, who tells us this, also informs us that her name, among the S cythians, was Artim pasa. Artim is Mitra, reversed. So, by reversing it, the Greeks fo rmed Artemis, Diana. One of the meanings of Rama, in Sanscr it, is Kama, the Deity of Love. Reverse this, and we have Amar, and by changing a into o, Amor, the Latin word for Love. Probably, as the verb is Am are, the oldest reading wa s Amar and not Amor. So Dipaka, in Sanscrit, one of the meanings whereof is love , is often written Dipuc. Reverse this, and we have, adding o, the Latin word Cupido. In Arabic, the radica l letters rhm, pronounced rahm, si gnify the trunk, compassion, mercy; this reversed, we have mhr, in Persic, love and t he Sun. In Hebrew we have Lab, the heart; and in Ch aldee, Bal, the heart; the radi cal letters of both being b and l. The Persic word for head is Sar. Reversed, this bec omes Ras in Arabic and Hebrew, Raish in Chaldee, Rash in Sama ritan, and Ryas in Ethiopic; all meaning head, chief, etc. In Ar ahic we have Kid, in the sense of rule, regulation, article of agreement, obligation; which, reversed, becomes, adding e, the Greek dike justice. In Coptic we have Chlom, a crown. Reversed, we hav e in Hebrew, Moloch or Malec, a King, or he who wears a crown. In the Kou-onen, or oldest Chi nese writing, by Hieroglyphics, Ge [Hi or Khi, with the initial letter modified], was the Sun: in Persic, Gaw: an d in Turkish Giun. Yue was the Moon; in Sanscrit Uh, and in Turkish Ai. It will be remembered in Egypt and elsewhere, the Sun wa s originally feminine, and the Moon masculine.

This was the great Mystery of the Ineffable Name; and this true arrangement of its letters, and of cour se its true pronuncia tion and its meaning, s oon became lost to all except select few to whom it was conf ided; it being conc ealed from common people, because the Deity thus metaphysi cally named was not that personal and capricious, and as it were tangible God in whom they believed, an d who alone was within the reach of th eir rude capacities. Diodorus says that the name gi ven by Moses to God was IAQ, Theodorus says that the Samaritans termed God IA BE, but the Jews IAQ. Phil o Byblius gives the form IEYQ: and Clemens of Alexandr ia IAOY. Macrobius says th at it was an admitted axiom among the Heathe n, that the triliteral IAQ was the sacred name of the Supreme God. And the Clarian oracle said: \"Learn t hou that IAQ is the great God Supreme, that ruleth over al l.\" The letter I si gnified Unity. A and Q are the first and last letters of the Greek Alphabet.

I am A and Q, the Beginning and the Ending, which IS, and Was, and IS to come : the Omnipotent.\" For in this we see shadowed forth the same great truth; th at God is all in all--the Cause and the Effect--the be ginning, or Impulse, or Ge nerative Power: and the Ending, or Result, or that whic h is produced: that He is in reality all that is, all that"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"ever was, and all that ever will be; in this sense, that nothing besides Himself has existed eternally, and co-eternally with Him , independent of Him, and self-existent, or self-originated. And thus the meaning of th e expression, ALOH AYIM, a plural nou n, used, in the account of the Creatio n With which Genesis commences, with a singular verb, and of the name or title IHUH ALHI M, used for the fi rst time in the 4t h verse of the 2d chapter of the same book, becomes clear. The ALHIM is the aggregate unity of the manifested Creative Forces or Powers of Deity, His Emanations; and IHUH-ALHIM is the ABSOLUTE Existence, or Essence of these Powers and Forces, of which they are Active Manifest ations and Emanations. This was the profound truth hidden in the anci ent allegory and co vered from the general view with a d ouble veil. This was the esoter ic meaning of the generation and production of the Indian , Chaldean, and Phoenician cosmognies; and the Active and Passive Powers, of the Male and Female Pr inciples; of Heaven and its Luminaries generating, and the Earth producin g; all hiding from vulgar view, as above its comprehension, the doc trine that matter is not eternal, but that God was the only original Existenc e, the ABSOLUTE, from Whom everything has proceeded, and to Whom all returns: and that all moral law springs not from the relation of things, but from His Wisdom and Essential Justice, as the Omnipotent Legislator. And this TRUE WORD is with entire accu racy said to have bee n lost; because its meaning was lost even among the Hebrews, althou gh we still find the name (its real meaning unsuspected), in t he Hu of the Druids and t he Fo HI of the Chinese. When we conceive of the Abso lute Truth, Beauty, or Good, cannot stop short at the abstraction of either. We are forced to refer each to some living and substantial Being, in which they have their foundations, so me being that is the first and last priciple of each. Moral Truth, like every other universal and necessary trut h, cannot remain a mere abstraction. Abstractions ar e unrealities. In ourselves , moral truth is merely conceived of. There must be somewhere a Bei ng that not only c onceives of, but constitutes it. It has this characteristic; that it is not only, to the eyes of our intelligence, an universal and necessary truth, bu t one obligator y on our will. It is A LAW. We do not establish that law ourselves. It is impo sed on us despite ourselves: its principle must be without us. It supposes a legisl ator. He cannot be the being to whom the law applies; but mu st be one that possesses in the highest degree all the characteristics of moral trut h. The moral law, universal and necessary, necessarily has as its author a necessa ry being;--composed of just ice and charity, its author must be a being possessing the plenitude of both. As all beautiful and al l true things refer themselves, t hese a Unity which is absolute TRUTH, and those to a Unity which absolute BEAUTY, so all the moral principles centre in a single principle, which is THE GOOD. Thus we arrive at the conception of THE GOOD in itself, the ABSOLUTE Good, superior to all particular duties, and determinate in those dut ies. This Absolute Good must necessarily be an attribute of the Absolute Being. There cannot be several Absolute Beings; the one in whom realized Absolute Truth and Ab solute Beauty being differ ent from the one in whom is realized Absolute Good. The Absolute necessarily implies ab solute Unity. The"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"True, the Beautiful, and Good are not three distinct essences: but they are one and same essence, considered in its fundamental attributes: the different phases which, in our eyes, the Abso lute and Infinite Perfection assu mes. Manifested in the World of the Finite and Relative, these three attributes separat e from each other, and are distinguished by our minds, wh ich can comprehend nothing except by division. But in the Being from Whom they emanate, they are in divisibly united; and this Being, at once triple and one, Who sums up in Himsel f perfect Beauty) perfe ct Truth, and the perfect Good, is GOD. God is necessarily the princi ple of Moral Truth, and of personal moralit y. Man is a moral person, that is to say, one endowed with reason and liberty. He is capable of virtue: and virtue has with him two principal forms, respect for other s and love of others,-- justice and charity. The creature can possess no r eal and essential attribute which the Creator does not possess. The effect can draw its reality and existenc e only from its cause. The cause contains in itself, at least, what is essential in the effect. The characteristic of the effect is inferiority, short-coming, imperfection. D ependent and deri vate, it bears in itself the marks and cond itions of dependenc e; and its imperfe ction proves the perfection of the cause; or else there would be in the effect so mething immanent, without a cause. God is not a logical Being, whose Nature may be expl ained by deduction, and by means of algebraic e quations. When, setti ng out with a primar y attribute, the attributes of God are ded uced one from the other, after the manner of the Geometricians and Scholastics, we have nothing but abstra ctions. We must emerge from this empty dialetic, to arrive at a true an d living God. The first notion which we have of God, that of an Infi nite Being, is not given us a priori, independently of all experience. It is our consciou sness of ourself, as at once a Being and a limited Being, that immediatel y raises us to the conception of a Being, the pr inciple of our being, and Himself without limi ts. If the existence that we possess forces us to recur to a cause possessing th e same existence in an infini te degree, all the substantial attributes of existence that we possess equally require each an infi nite cause. God, then, is no longer th e Infinite, Abstract, Indetermina te Being, of which reason and the heart cannot lay hold, but a real Bei ng, determinate like ourselves, a moral person like ourself; and the st udy of our own souls will c onduct us, withou t resort to hypothesis, to a conception of God, both sublime a nd having a connection with ourselves. If man be free, God must be so. It would be strange if , while the creature has that marvellous power of disposi ng of himself, of choosing and willing freely, the Being that has made him should he subject to a necessary developm ent, the cause of which, though in Himself, is a sort of abstract, mechanical, or metaphysical power, inferior to the personal, vo luntary cause which we are, and of which we have the clearest consciousness. God is free because we ar e: but he is not free as we are. He is at once everything that we are, and nothing that we ar e. He possesses the same attributes as we, but extended to infinity. He pos sesses, then, an infinite liberty, united to an infinite intelligence; and as His intell igence is infallible, exempt from the uncertainty of deli beration, and percei ving at a glance wh ere the Good is, so His liberty accomp lishes it spontaneously and without effort."},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"As we assign to God th at liberty which is the basis of our existence, so also we transfer to His character, from our own, justice and charity. In man they are virtues: in God, His attributes. What is in us the laborious conques t of liberty, is in Him His very nature. The idea of th e right, and the res pect paid to the right , are signs of the dignity of our existence. If respect of rights is the ve ry essence of justice, the Perfect Being must know and respect the ri ghts of the lowest of His creatures; for He assigned them those rights. In God resides a sovereig n justice, that renders to every one what is due him, not according to deceitful a ppearances, but according to the truth of things. And if ma n, a limited bei ng, has the power to go out of himself, to forget his own person, to lo ve another like himself, and devote himself to his happiness, dignity, and perfe ction, the Perfect Being must have, in an infinite degree, that disinterested te nderness, that Charity, th e Supreme virtue of the human person. There is in God an infinite tenderness for His creatures, manifested in His giving us existence, which He might have withheld; and every day it appears in innumerable marks of His Divine Providence. Plato well understood that love of God, and expr esses it in these great words: \"Let us speak of the cause whic h led the Supreme Arranger of the Universe to produce and regulate that Univer se. He was good; and he who is good has no kind of ill will. Exempt from that, He willed that created things should be, as far as possible, like Himself.\" And Christianity in its turn said , \"God has so loved m en that He has given them His only Son.\" It is not correct to affirm, as is often d one, that Christianity has in some sort discovered this noble sent iment. We must not lower human nature, to raise Christianity. Antiquity knew, described, and practi sed charity; the first feature of which, so touching, and thank God! so common, is goodness, as it s loftiest one is heroism. Charity is devotion to another; and it is ridicu lously senseless to pretend that there ever was an age of the world, when the human soul wa s deprived of that part of its heritage, t he power of devotion. But it is certain that Ch ristianity has diffused and popularized this virtue, and that, bef ore Christ, these words were never spoken: LOVE ONE ANOT HER; FOR THAT IS THE WHOLE LAW. Charity presupposes Justice. He who truly loves his brother re spects the rights of his brother; but he does more, he forgets his own. Egoism sells or ta kes. Love delights in giving. In G od, love is what it is in us; but in an in finite degree. God is inexhaustible in His charity, as He is inexhaustible in His essence. That Infinite Omnipotence and Infinite C harity, which, by an admirabl e good-will, dr aws from the bosom of its immense love t he favors which it incessantly bestows on the world and on humanity, teaches us that the more we give, the mo re we possess. God being all just and all good, He can wi ll nothing but what is good and just. Being Omnipotent, whatever He wi lls He can do, and consequent ly does. The world is the work of God: it is th erefore perfectly made. Yet there is disorder in th e world, that seems to impu gn the justice an d goodness of God. A principle indissolubly connec ted with the very idea of good, tell s us that every moral agent deserves reward when he does well, and puni shment when he does ill.

But good actions are not alwa ys followed by happiness, nor evil ones by misery. Though often this fact is mo re apparent than real; though virtue, a war against the passions, full of dignity but full of sorr ow and pain, has the latter as its condition, yet the pains that follow vice ar e greater; and virtue conduce s most to heal th, strength, and long life;--though the peaceful conscienc e that accompanies virtue creates internal happiness; though public opinion gener ally decides correctly on men's characters, and rewards virtue with est eem and consideration, and vice with contempt and infamy; and t hough, after all, justice re igns in the world, and the surest road to happi ness is still that of vi rtue, yet there are exceptions. Virtue is not always rewarded, nor vice punished, in this life. The data of this problem are these: 1st. The principle of merit and demerit within us is absolute: every good acti on ought to rewarded, every bad one punish ed: 2d. God is just as He is al powerful: 3d. Th ere are in this worl d particular cases, contradicting the necessary and universal law of merit and demerit. What is the result? To reject the two principl es, that God is just, and the law merit and demerit absolute, is to raze to the foundations the whol e edifice of human faith. To maintain them, is to adm it that the present life is to terminated or continued elsewhere. The moral per son who acts well or ill, and awaits reward or punishment, is connected with a body, lives with it, ma kes use of it, depends upon it in a meas but is not it. The body is com posed of parts. It diminishes or increases, it is divisible even to infinity. But this something which has a consciousness of itself, and says \"I, ME\"; that feels itself free and responsible, feels too that it is incapable of division, that it is a being one and simple; that the ME cannot be halved, t hat if a li mb is cut off and thrown away, no part of the ME, goes with it: that it remains identical with itself under the variety phenomena whic h successively manifest it. This identity, indivisibility, and absol ute unity of the person , are its spirituality, the very essence of the person. It is not in the least an hypo thesis to affirm th at the soul differs essentially from the body. By the soul we mean the person, not se parated from the consciousnes of the attribut es which constitute it,--t hought and will. The Existence without consciousness is an abst ract being, and no t a person. It is the person, that is identical, one, simple. Its attributes, develop ing it, do not divide it . Indivisible, it is indissoluble, and may be immortal. If absolut e justice requires this immortality, it does not require what is impo ssible. The spiritua lity of the soul is the condition and necessary foundation of immo rtality: the law of meri t and demerit the direct demonstration of it. The first is the metaphysical, the seco nd the moral proof. Add to these the tendency of all the powers of the soul toward th e Infinite, and the principle of final causes, and the proof of the im mortality of the soul is complete. God, therefore, in the Masonic creed, is INFINITE TRUTH, INFINITE BEAUTY, INFINITE GOODNESS. He is the Holy of Ho lies, as Author of the Moral Law, as the PRINCIPLE of Liberty, of Justice, and of Charity, Dispenser of Reward and"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"Punishment. Such a God is no t an abstract God; but an intelligent and free person, Who has made us in His ima ge, from Whom we receive t he law that presides over our destiny, and Wh ose judgment we await. It is His lo ve that inspires us in our acts of charity: it is His justice that governs our justice, and that of society and the laws. We continually remind ourselves that He is infinite ; because otherwise we should degrade His nature: bu t He would be for us as if He were not, if His infinite nature had not forms inherent in ourselves, the forms of our own reason and soul. When we love Truth, Justice, and Nobility of Soul, we shou ld know that it is God we love underneath thes e special forms, and should unite them all into one great act of total piety. We should feel that we go in and out continual ly in the midst of the vast forces of the Universe, which are only the Forces of God; that in our studies, when we attain a truth, we confro nt the thought of G od; when we l earn the right, we learn the will of God laid down as a rule of conduct for the Universe; and when we feel disinterested love, we should know that we partake the fe eling of the In finite God. Then, when we reverence the mi ghty cosmic force, it will not be a blind Fate in an Atheistic or Pantheisti c world, but the Infinite God, th at we shall conf ront and feel and know. Then we shall be mi ndflll of the mind of God, conscious of God's conscience, sensible of His se ntiments, and our own existenc e will be in the infinite being of God. The world is a whole, whic h has its harmony; for a God who is One, could make none but a complete and harmonious work. The harm ony of the Universe responds to the unity of God, as the indefinite quantity is the definite sign of the infinitude of God. To say that the Universe is God, is to admit the world on ly, and On the other hand, to suppose that t he Universe is void of God, and that He is whol ly apart from it, is an insupportable and almost impossible abstraction. To distinguish is not to separate. I distinguish, but do not separate myself from my qualities and effects. So God is not the Universe, alth ough He is everywhere presen t in spirit and in truth. To us, as to Plato, absolut e truth is in God. It is God Himself under one of His phases. In God, as their or iginal, are the immutable pr inciples of reality and cognizance. In Him things rece ive at once their existence and their intelligibility. It is by participating in the Divi ne reason that our own re ason possesses something of the Absolute. Every judgment of reason envelopes a nec essary truth, and every necessary truth supposes the necessary Existence. Thus, from every direction,-- from metaphysics, aesthetics, an morality above all, we rise to the same Principle, the common centre, and ultima te foundation of all truth, all beauty, all good. The True, the B eautiful, the Go od, are but diverse revelations of one and the same Being. Thus we reach the thre shold of religion and are in communion with the great phi losophies which all proclaim a God; and at the same time with the religions which cove the earth, and all repos e on the sacred foundation of natur al religion; of that religion which reveals to us the natural light give to all men, without the aid of a particular revelation. So long a philosophy does not arrive at religion, it is below all worships even the most imperfect; for they at least give man a Father, a Wi tness, a Consoler, a Judge. By religion, philosophy connects itself with hu manity, which, from one end of the world to the other, aspires to God, believes in God, hopes in God. Philosophy contains in itself the common basis of all religious beliefs; it, as it were, borrows from them their principle, and"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"returns it to them surround ed with light, elevat ed above uncertainty, secure against all attack. From the necessity of His Nature, the Infi nite Being must crea te and preserve the Finite, and to th e Finite must, in its forms, give and communica te of His own kind. We cannot conceive of any finite thing ex isting without God, th e Infinite basis and ground thereof; nor of God ex isting without something. G od is the necessary logical condition of a world, its ne cessitating cause; a worl d, the necessary logical condition of God, Hi s necessitated consequence. It is according to His Infinite Perfection to create, and then to preserve and bless whatever He creates. That is the conclusion of modern metaphysical science. The stream of philosophy runs down from Aristotle to Hegel, and breaks of f with this conclu sion: and then again recurs the ancient difficulty. If it be of His nature to creat e,--if we cannot conceive of His existing alone, without cr eating, without having crea ted, then what He created was co-existent with Himself. If He could exist an instant without creating, He could as well do, so for a myriad of eternities. And so again conles rou nd to us the old doctrine of a God, t he Soul of the Universe, and co-e xistent with it. For what He created had a beginning; and however long si nce that creation o ccurred, an eternity had before elapsed. The difference be tween a beginning and no beginning is infinite. But of some things we can be certain. We are conscious of ourselves--of ourselves if not as substances, at least as Powers to be, to do, to suffer. We are conscious of ourselves not as self origi nated at all or as self-susta ined alone; but only as dependent, first for existence, ever since for support. Among the primary ideas of co nsciousness, that are inse parable from it, the atoms of self-consciousness, we find the idea of God. Carefully examined by the scrutizing intellect, it is the idea of God as infinite, perfectly powerful, wise, just, loving, holy; absolute being with no li mitation. This made us, made all, sustains us, sustains all; made our body, not by a sing le act, but by a series of acts extending over a vast succession of years,--for man' s body is the resultant of all created things,-- made our spirit, our mind, co nscience, affections, soul, will, appointed for each its natural mode of action, set each at its several aim. Thus se lf-consciousness leads us to consciousness of God, and at last to consciousness of an infinite God. That is the highest evidence of our ow n existence, and it is the highest evidence of His. If there is a God at all, He must be omnipresent in sp ace. Beyond the last Stars He must be, as He is here. Th ere can be no mote that pe oples the sunbeams, no little cell of life that t he microscope discovers in the se ed-sporule of a mo ss, but He is there. He must also be omnipresen t in time. There was no seco nd of time before the Stars began to burn, but God was in that second. In the most distant nebulous spot in Orion's belt, and in every one of the millions that people a square inch of limestone, God is alike present. He is in the smallest imaginable or even unimaginable portion of time, and in every second of its most vast and un imaginable volume; His Here conterminous with t he All of Space, His Now coev al with the All of Time."},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"Through all this space, in all this Time, His Being extends, spreads undivided, operates unspent; God in all Hi s infinity, perfectl y powerful, wise, just, loving, and holy. His being is an infinite activity, a creating, and so a giving of Himself to the World. The World's being is a becoming, a being created and continued. It is so now, and was so, incalculab le and unimaginab le millions of ages ago. All this is philosophy, the unavoidable conclusion of th e human mind. It is not the opinion of Coleridge and Kant , but their science; not w hat theyg~uess, but what they know. In virtue of this in-dwelling of God in matter, we say that the world is a revelation of Him, its existence a show of His. He is in His work. The mani fold action of the Universe is only His mode of operation, and all materi al things are in communion with Him. All grow and move and live in Him, and by mean s of Him, and only so. Let Him withdraw from t he space occupied by anything, an d it ceases to be. Let Him withdraw any quality of His na ture from anything, and it ceases to be. All must partake of Him, He dwelling in each, and yet transcending all. The failure of fanciful reli gion to become phil osophy, does not pr eclude philosophy from coinciding with true reli gion. Philosophy, or rather its object, th e divine order of the Universe, is the intellec tual guide which the religi ous sentiment needs; while exploring the real relations of the finite, it obtains a co nstantly improving and self- correcting measure of the perfect law of the Gospel of Love and Liberty, and a means of carrying into effect the spiritualism of revealed religion. It establishes law, by ascertaining its terms; it guides the spirit to see it s way to the amel ioration of life and the increase of happiness. While religion was stat ionary, science could not walk alone; when both are ad mitted to be progressive, their interests and aims become identified. Aristotle began to sh ow how religion may be founded on an intellectual basis; but t he basis he laid was too narro w. Bacon, by giving to philosophy a definite aim an d method, gave it at the sa me time a safer and self- enlarging basis. Our position is that of in tellectual beings surr ounded by limitations; and the latter being constant, ha ve to intelligence the pr actical value of laws, in whose investigation and appl ication consists that seem ingly endless career of intellectual and moral pr ogress which the sentiment of religion inspires and ennobles. The title of Saint has commonl y been claimed for th ose whose boast it has been to despise philosophy; yet faith will stumble and s entiment mislead, unless knowledge be pr esent, in amount and quality suffici ent to purify the one and to give beneficial dire ction to the other. Science consists of thos e matured inferences from experice which all other experience confirms. It is no fixed system perior to revision, but that progressive mediation between ignoranc e and wisdom in part conceived by Plato, whose immediate object is happines s, and its impulse the high est kind of love. Science realizes and unites all that was truly valuable in both the old sc hemes of mediation; the heroic, or system of acti on and effort; and the mystic al theory of spiritual, contemplative contemplative communion. \"Listen to me,\" says Galen, \"as to the voice of the Eleusinian Hieroph ant, and believ e that the study of nature is a mystery no less important than theirs , nor less adapted to displa y the wisdom and power of the Great Creator. Their lessons and demonstrations were obscure, but ours are clear and unmistakable.\""},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"To science we owe it that no man is any long er entitled to conider himself the central point around which the whole Univer se of life and mo tion revolves--the immensely important indivi dual or whose convenience and even luxurious ease and indulgence the whole Universe was made. On one side it has shown us an infinite Universe of stars and suns and worlds at incalculable di stances from each other, in whose majestic and awful presence we si nk and even our world sinks into insignificance; while, on the other si de, the microscope has placed us in communication with new worl ds of organized livings beings, gi fted with senses, nerves, appetites, and in stincts, in every tear and in every drop of putrid water. Thus science teaches us that we are but an infinitesimal portio n of a great whole, that stretches out on every side of us, and above and below us , infinite in its complications, and which infini te wisdom alone can comp rehend. Infinite wisdom has arranged the infinite succession of bein gs, involving the nec essity of birth, decay, and death, and made the loftiest vi rtues possible by providing those conflicts, reverses , trials, and hardshi ps, without which even their names could never have been invented. Knowledge is convertible into power, and axioms into rules of utility and duty. Modern science is social and communicative. It is moral as well as intellectual; powerful, yet pacific and disinterested; bi nding man to man as well as to the Universe; filling up the detail s of olbligation, and cheris hing impulses of virtue, and, by affording clear proof of th e consistency and identity of all interests, substituting co-operation for rivalry, liber ality for jealousy, and tending far more powerfully than any other means to realize the spirit of religion, by healing those inveterate disorders which, traced to th eir real origin, will be f ound rooted in an ignorant assumption as to the penur ious severity of Providenc e, and the consequent greed of selfish men to confine w hat seemed as if ex torted from it to themselves, or to steal from each other rather than quietly to enjoy their own. We shall probably never reach those higher forms c ontaining the true differences of things, involving the full di scovery and correct expressi on of their ve ry self or essence. We shall ever fall short of the most general and most simple nature, the ultimate or most comprehe nsive law. Our widest axioms explain many phenomena, but so too in a degre e did the principles or elements of the old philoso phers, and the cycles and epicycles of ancient astronom y. We cannot in any case of causation assign the whole of the c onditions, nor though we may re produce them in practice, can we mentally distinguish them all, without knowing t he essences of the things including them; and we therefore must not unconscious ly ascribe that absolute certainty to axioms, which th e ancient religionists did to creeds, nor allow the mind, which ever strives to insulate itself and its acqui sitions, to forget the nature of the process by which it substi tuted scientific for common not ions, and so with one as with the other lay the basi s of self-deception by a pedantic and superstitious employment of them. Doubt, the essential prelim inary of all improvement an d discovery, must accompany all the stages of man's onwa rd progress. His intellectual life is a perpetual beginning, a prepetual beginning, a preparation for a bi rth.

The boast of science is no t so much its manifested results, as its adm itted imperfection and capacity of unlimited progress. The true religious philosophy of an imperfect being is not a system of creed, but, as Socrates thought, an infinite search or approximation. Finality is but another name for bewilderment or defe at. Science gratifies the religious feeling withou t arresting it, and opens out the unfat homable mystery of the One Su preme into more explicit and manageable Forms, which ex press not indeed His Essence, which is wholly beyond our reach and higher t han our facultie s can climb, but His Will, and so feeds an endless enthusiasm by accu mulating forever new objects of pursuit.

God and truth are inseparabl e; a knowledge of God is possession of the saving oracles of truth. In propor tion as the thought and purpose of th e individual are trained to conformity with th e rule of right prescribed by supreme Intelligence, so far is his happiness promoted, and the purpose of his existence fulfilled. In this way a new life arises in him; he is no longer isolated, but is a part of the eternal harmonies around him. His er ring will is directed by the influe nce of a higher wi ll, informing and moulding it in the path of his true happiness. Man's power of apprehending ou tward truth is a qualified privilege; the mental like the physical inspiration pa ssing through a diluted m edium; and yet, even when truth, imparted, as it were, by intuition, has been spec ious, or at leas t imperfect, the intoxication of sudden discovery has ever claimed it as full, infallible, and divine.

Everything is a thought of th e Infinite God. Natu re is His prose, and man His Poetry. There is no Chance, no Fate; but God's Great Providence, enfolding the whole Universe in its bosom, and f eeding it with everlasting li fe. In times past there has been evil which we ca nnot understand; now there are evils whic h we cannot solve, nor make square with God's perfect good ness by any theory our feeble intellect enables us to frame. There ar e sufferings, follies, and sins for all mankind, for every nation, for every man and ev ery woman. They were all foreseen by the infinite wisdom of God, all provided for by His infinite power and ju stice, and all are consistent with His infinite love. To believe otherwise w ould be to believe that He made the world, to amuse His idle hours with the follies and agonies of mankind, as Domitian was wont to do with the wrigglings and contortions of insect agonies. Then indeed we might despairin gly unite in that ho rrible utterance of Heine: \"Alas, God's Satire weighs heavily on me! The Great Aut hor of the Universe, the Aristophanes of Heaven, is bent on demonstrat ing, with crushing force, to me, the little, earthly, German Aristophanes, how my witt iest sarcasms are only piti ful attempts at jesting, in comparison with His, and how miserably I am beneath Him, in hu mor, in colossal mockery.\" No, no! God is not thus amus ed with and prodigal of human sufferin g. The world is neither a Here without a Here after, a body without a soul, a chaos with no God; nor a body blasted by a soul, a Here with a worse Hereafter, a world with a God that hates more than half the crea tures He has made. There is no Savage, Revengeful, and Evil God: but ther e is an Infinite Go d, seen everywhere as Perfect Cause, everywhere as Perfect Providence, transce nding all, yet in-d welling everywhere, with perfect power, wisdom, justice, holiness, and love, providing for the future welfare of each and all, fo reseeing and foreca ring for every bubble that breaks on the great stream of human life and human history. The end of man and the object of existence in this worl d, being not on ly happiness, but happiness in vi rtue and through vi rtue, virtue in this wo rld is the condition of happiness in another life, and the condition of virtue in this wo rld is suffering, more or less frequent, brie fer or longer conti nued, more or less intense. Take away suffering, and t here is no longer any resi gnation or humanity, no more self-sacrifice, no more devotedness, no more heroic virt ues, no more sublim e morality. We are subjected to suffering, both because we are sensible, a nd because we ought to be virtuous. If there were no ph ysical evil, there would be no possible vi rtue, and the world would be badly adapted to the destiny of man. T he apparent disorders of the physical world, and the evils that result from them, are not disorders and evils that occur despite the power and goodness of God. God not only allows , but wills them. It is His will that there sh all be in the physica l world causes enough of pain for man, to afford him occasions for resignation and courage. Whatever is favorable to virtue, whatever gives the moral liberty more energy, whatever can serve the grea ter moral development of the human race, is good."},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"Suffering is not the worst c ondition of man on earth. The worst condi tion is the moral brutalization which the absenc e of physical evil would engender. External or internal physical evil connects itself with the object of existence, which is to accomplish the moral law here below, whatever the consequ ences, with the firm hope that virtue unfortunate will no t fail to be rewarded in another life. The moral law has its sanction and its reason in itself. It owes no thing to that la w of merit and demerit that accompanies it, but is not its basis. But, though t he principle of merit and demerit ought not to be the determining prin ciple of virtuous ac tion, it powerfully concurs with the moral law, because it offers virtue a legi timate ground of consolation and hope. Morality is the recognition of duty, as duty, and its accompli shment, whatever the consequences. Religion is the recognition of duty in its necessary harmony with goodness; a harmony that must have its realization in another life , through the justice and omnipotence of God. Religion is as true as morality; for once mo rality is admitted, it s consequences must be admitted. The whole moral existence is included in these two words, ha rmonious with each other: DUTY and HOPE. Masonry teaches that God is infinitely good. What mo tive, what reason, and, morally speaking, what possibility can there be to Infinite Power and Infinite Wisdom, to be anything but g ood? Our very sorrows, proc laiming the loss of objects inexpressibly dear to us, demonstrate His Goodness. The Being that made us intelligent cannot Himself be without inte lligence; and He Who has made us so to love and to sorrow for what we love, must number love for the creatures He has made, among His infinite attributes. Amid all our sorrows, we take refuge in the assurance that He loves us; that He does not capriciously, or th rough indifference, and still less in mere anger, gr ieve and afflict us; that He chastens us, in order that by His chastisements, which are by His universal law onl y the consequences of our acts, we may be profited; and that He coul d not show so much love for His creatures, by leaving them unchastened, untr ied, undisciplined. We have faith in the Infinite; faith in God's Infi nite Love; and it is that faith that must save us. No dispensations of God's Providence, no suffering or bereavement is a messenger of wrath: none of it s circumstances are indications of God's Anger. He is incapable of Anger; higher above an y such feelings than the dist ant stars are ab ove the earth. Bad men do not die because G od hates them.

It is not to be erased; but Masonry sees and reads it in a new light. It does not expect these ills and tria ls and sufferings to be remo ved from life; but that the great truth will at some ti me be believed by all men, that they are the means selected by infinite wisdom , to purify the hear t, and to invigorate the soul whose inheritance is immortality, and the worl d its school. Masonry propagates no creed except its own most si mple and Sublim e One; that universal religion, taught by Nature and by Reason. Its Lodges are neither Jewish, Moslem, nor Christian Temples. It reiterates the precepts of morality of all religions. It venerates the character and commends the teachings of the great and good of all ages and of all countries. It ex tracts the good and not the evil, the tr uth, and not the error, from all creeds; and acknowledges that there is much which is good and true in all. Above all the other grea t teachers of morality and virtue, it reve res the character of the Great Master Who, submissive to the will of His and our Father, died upon the Cross. All must ad mit, that if the world were filled with beings like Him, the great ills of society would be at once relieved. For all coercion , injury, selfishness, and revenge, and all the wro ngs and the greatest su fferings of life, would disappear at once. These human years w ould be happy; and the eterna l ages would roll on in brightness and beaut y; and the still, s ad music of Humanity, that sounds through the world, now in the acce nts of grief, and now in pensive melanc holy, would change to anthems, so unding to the March of Time, and bursting out fr om the heart of the world. If every man were a perfect im itator of that Gr eat, wise, Good Teac her, clothed with all His faith and all Hi s virtues, how the circ le of Life's ills and trials would be narrowed! The sensual passion s would assail the heart in vain. Want would no longer successfully tempt men to act wrong ly, nor curiosity to do rashly. Ambition, spreading before men its Kingd oms and its Thrones, and offices and honors, would cause none to swerve from their great allegiance. Inju ry and insult would be shamed by forgiveness \"Father, \" men would say, \"forgive them; for they know not what they do.\" None would seek to be enr iched at another's lo ss or expense.

However the Mason may believe as to cr eeds, and churches, and miracles, and missions from Heaven, he must admit that the Life and ch aracter of Him who taught in Galilee, and fragments of Whose teachings have come down to us, are worthy of all imitation. That Life is an undenied and undeniable Go spel. Its teachings cannot be passed by and discarded. All must admit that it would be happiness to follow and perfection to imitate Him. No ne ever felt for Him a sinc ere emotion of contempt, nor in anger accused Him of so phistry, nor saw immorality lurking in His doctrines; however they may judge of those who succeed ed Him, and clai med to be His apostles.

If our aims went as completely as His beyond personal care and selfish gratification; if our thoug hts and words and actions were as entirely employed upon the great work of benefitin g our kind-- the true work wh ich we have been placed here to do - as His were; if our nature were as gentle and as tender as His; and if society, country, kindred, fr iendship, and home were as dea r to us as they were to Him, we should be at once re lieved of more than half the difficulties and the diseased and painful affections of our lives. Si mple obedience to rectitude, instead of self-interest; simple self-culture and self-improve ment, instead of constant cultivation of the good opini on of others; single-hearte d aims and purposes, instead of improper objects, sought and approached by devious and crooked ways, would free our meditations of many dist urbing and irri tating questions. Not to renounce the nobler and better affections of our natures, nor happiness, nor our just dues of love and hon or from men; not to vilify ourselves , nor to renounce our self-respect, nor a just and reasonable sense of our merits and deserts, nor our own righteousness of virtue , does Masonry requi re, nor would our imitation of Him require; but to renounce ou r vices, our faults, our pa ssions, our self-flattering delusions; to forego all outwa rd advantages, which are to be gained only through a sacrifice of our inward integrity, or by anxious and pett y contrivances and appliances; to choose and keep the better part; to secure that, and let the worst take care of itself; to ke ep a good conscience, and let opinion come and go as it will; to retain a lofty self -respect, and let low self-indulg ence go; to keep inward happiness, and let outward advantages hold a subordinate place; to renoune our selfishness, and that eternal anxiety as to what we are to have, and what men think of us; and be content with t he plenitude of God's great me rcies, and so to be happy. For it is the inordinate devot ion to self, and consideration of self, that is ever a a stumbling block in the way; that spreads questions, sn ares, and difficulties around us, darkens the way of Prov idence, and makes the world a far less happy one to us than it might be.

No man ever found peace or light in that way. Every rela tion, of hate, scorn, or neglect, to mank ind, is full of vexation and torment.

Morality has its axioms, like the othe r sciences; and these axioms are, in all languages, justly termed mora l truths. Moral truths, cons idered in themselves, are equally as certain as mathematical truths. Given the idea of a deposit, the idea of keeping it faithfully is attac hed to it as necessarily, as to the idea of a triangle is attached the idea that it s three angles are equal to two right angles. You may violate a deposit; but in doi ng so, do not imagi ne that you change the nature of things, or make what is in itself a deposit become your own property. The two ideas exclude each other. You have bu t a false semblance of prop erty: and all the efforts of the passions, all the sophis ms of interest, will not ov erturn essential differences. Therefore it is that a moral tr uth is so imperious; because, li ke all truth, it is what it is, and shapes itself to pl ease no caprice. Always t he same, and always present, little as we may like it, it inexorably c ondemns, with a voice always heard, but not always regarded, the insensate and guilty will which thinks to prevent its existing, by denying, or rather by pretending to deny , its existence. The moral truths are distingu ished from othe r truths by this si ngular characteristic: so soon as we perceive them, th ey appear to us as the rule of our co nduct. If it is true that a deposit is made in order to be returned to it s legitimate possessor, it must be returned. To the neces sity of believing the truth, the necessity practising it is added. The necessity of practising the moral truths is oblig ation. The moral truths, necessary to the eye of reas on, are obligatory on the will. The mora l obligation, like the moral truth which is its basis, is absolut e. As necessary truths are not more or less necessary, so obligation is not more or less obligatory. Th ere are degrees of importance among differ ent obligations; but there are no degrees in the obligation itself. One is not nearly obliged, almost obliged; but wholly so, or not at all. If there be any place of refuge against the obligation, it ceases to exist. If the obligation is absolute, it is immuta ble and universal. For if what is obligation to-day may not be so to-morrow, if what is obligatory for me ma y not be so for you, the obligation differing from it self, it would be relative and contin gent. This fact of absolute, immutable, univer sal obligation is certain a nd manifest. The good is the foundation of obligati on. If it be not, obligation has no founda tion; and that is impossible. If one act ought to be done, and another ought not, it must be because evidently there is an ess ential difference bet ween the two acts. If one be not good and the other bad, the obligation imposed on us is arbitrary. To make the Good a c onsequence, of anything whatever, is to annihilate it. It is the first, or it is nothing. When we ask an honest m an why, despite his urgent necessities, he has respected the sanctity of a deposit, he answ ers, because it was his duty. Asked why it was his duty, he answers, because it was right, was just, was"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"good. Beyond that there is no answer to be made, but there is also no question to be asked. No one permits a duty to be imposed on him without giving himself a reason for it: but when it is admitted that the duty is commanded by justice, the mind is satisfied; for it has arrived at a prin ciple beyond which there is nothing to seek, justice being its own pr inciple. The primary truths include their own reason: and justice, the essential di stinction between good and ev il, is the first truth of morality. Justice is not a consequence; because we cannot ascend to any principle above it. Moral truth forces itself on man, and does not emanat e from him. It no more becomes subjective, by appear ing to us obligatory, than truth does by appearing to us necessary. It is in the ve ry nature of the tr ue and the good that we must seek for the reason of necessity and obligation. Ob ligation is founded on the necessary distinction between the good and the evil; and it is itself the f oundation of liberty. If man has his duties to perform, he must have the facult y of accomplishing them, of resisting desire, passi on, and interest, in order to obey the law. He must be free; therefore he is so, or human na ture is in contradiction wi th itself. The certainty of the obligation involves the corres ponding certainty of free will. It is the will that is free: though sometimes that will may be inef fectual. The power to do must not be confounded with the power to will. The former may be limited: the latter is sovereign. The external effect s may be prevented: the resolution itself cannot. Of this sovereign po wer of the will we are conscious. We feel in ourselves, before it becomes determinate, the force which can determi ne itself in one way or another. At the same time when I will this or that, I am equally consci ous that I can will the contrary. I am conscious that I am the master of my re solution: that I may check it, continue it, retake it. When the act has ceased , the consciousness of the power which produced it has not. That consciousness and the power remain, superior to all t he manifestations of th e power. Wherefore free -will is the essential and ever-subsisting attribut e of the will itself. At the same time that we judge that a fr ee agent has done a good or a bad act, we form another judgment, as ne cessary as the first; that if he has done well, he deserves compensation; if il l, punishment. That judgment may be expressed in a manner more or less vivid, a ccording as it is mingled with sentiments more or less ardent. Sometimes it will be a merely kind feeling to ward a virtuous agent, and moderately hostile to a guilty one; sometime s enthusiasm or indignation. The judgment of merit and demerit is intimately connected with the judgm ent of good and evil. Merit is the natura l right which we have to be rewarded; demerit the natural right which others ha ve to punish us. But whether the reward is received, or the punishment under gone, or not, the merit or demerit equally subsists. Punishment and reward are the satisfaction of merit and demerit, but do not constitute them. Take away the former, and the latter conti nue. Take away the latter, and there are no l onger real rewards or punishments. When a base man encompasses our merited honors, he has obtained the mere ap pearance of a reward; a mere material adv antage. The reward is essentia lly moral; and its value is independent of its form. One of those simple crowns of oak with which the early Romans rewarded heroism, wa s of more real va lue than the wealth of the world, when it was the sign of t he gratitude and admi ration of a people. Reward accorded to merit is a debt; without merit it is an alms or a theft."},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"The Good is good in itself, and to be accomplished, whatever the consequences.

If virtue suppose sacrifice (t hat is, suffering), eternal justice requi res that sacrifice generously accepted and cour ageously borne, sh all have for its reward the same happiness that was sacrificed: and it also requires that crime shall be punished with unhappiness, for the guilt y happiness which it at tempted to procure. This law that attaches pleas ure and sorrow to the good and the evil , is, in general, accomplished even here below . For order rules in the world; because the world lasts. Is that order so metimes disturbed? Are happin ess and sorrow not always distributed in legi timate proportion to crime and virtue? The ab solute judgment of the Good, the absolute judgment of obligat ion, the absolute judg ment of merit and demerit, continue to subsist, inviolable and impre scriptible; and we cannot help but believe that He Who has im planted in us the sentiment and idea of or der, cannot therein Himself be want ing; and that He wi ll, sooner or later, reestablish the holy harmony of virtue and happiness, by means belonging to Himself. The Judgment of the Good, the decision that such a th ing is good, and that such another is not,--this is the primitive fact, and reposes on itself. By its intimate resemblances to the ju dgment of the true and the beautiful, it shows us the secret affinities of morality, meta physics, and aesthetics. The good, so especilly united to the true, is distinguis hed from it, only bec ause it is truth put in practice. The good is obligatory. These are two indi visible but not identical i deas. The idea of obligation reposes on the idea of the Good. In this in timate alliance, the former borrows from the latter its universal and absolute character. The obligatory good is the moral law. That is the foundation of all mo rality. By it we separate ourselves from the mo rality of interest and the mo rality of sentiment. We admit the existence of those facts, and t heir influence; but we do not assign them the same rank. To the moral law, in the r eason of man, corresponds li berty in action. Liberty is deduced from obligation, and is a fact irresistibly evi dent. Man, as free, and subject to obligation, is a moral pers on; and that involves the id ea of rights. To these ideas is added that of merit a nd demerit; which supposes the distincti on between good and evil, obligation and liber ty; and creates the idea of reward and punishment. The sentiments play no un important part in morality . All the moral judgments are accompanied by sentiments t hat respond to t hem. From the secr et sources of enthusiasm the human will dr aws the mysterious virtue that makes heroes. Truth enlightens and illumines . Sentiment warms and inclines to action. Interest also bears its part; and the hope of happiness is the work of God, an d one of the motive powers of human action. Such is the admirab le economy of the moral cons titution of man.

G enerally he attaches hap piness to virtue; and for the exceptions, for such there are, he has placed Hope at th e end of the journey to be travelled. Thus there is a side on which morality touches re ligion. It is a subl ime necessity of Humanity to see in God the Legislator suremely wise, the witness always present, the infallible Judge of vi rtue. The human mind, ever climbing up to God, would deem the foundations of morali ty too unstahle, if it did not place in God the first principle of the moral law. Wi shing to give to the moral la w a religious character, we run the risk of taking from it its moral character. We may refer it so entirely to God as to make His will an arbi trary degree. But the will of God, whence we deduce morality, in order to gi ve it authority, itself has no moral authority, exccpt as it is just. The Good comes from the will of God alon e; but from His will, in so far as it is the expression of His wisdom and justice. Th e Eternal Justice of God is the sole foundation of Justice, such as Humanity perceives and pr actises it. The Good, duty, merit and demerit, are re ferred to God, as ev erything is referred to Him; but they have none the less a proper evidence and authority. Re ligion is the crown of Morality, not its base. The base of Morality is in itself. The Moral Code of Masonr y is still more extensiv e than tha developed by philosophy. To the requisition s of the law of Nature and t he law of God, it adds the imperative obligation of a contract. Upon enter ing the Order, the Initiate binds to himself every Mason in the wo rld. Once enrolled among the children of light, every Mason on earth become s his brother, and ow es him the duties, the kindnesses, and the sympathies of a brother. On every one he may call for assistance in need, protection against danger, sym pathy in sorrow, attenti on in sickness, and decent burial after death. Th ere is not a Mason in the worl d who is not bound to go to his relief, when he is in danger, if there be greater probability of saving his life than of losing his own. No Mason c an wrong him to the value of anything, knowingly, himself, nor suffer it to be done by others, if it be in his power to prevent it. No Mason can speak evil of hi m, to his face or behind his back. Every Mason must keep his lawful secrets, a nd aid him in his business, defend his ch aracter when unjustly assailed, and protect, counsel, and assist his widow and his orphans. What so many thousands owe to him, he owes to each of them. He has solemnly bound himself to be ever ready to discharge this sacred debt. If he fails to do it he is dishonest and forsworn; and it is an unparalle led meanness in him to obtain good offices by false pretences, to receive kindne ss and service, re ndered him under the confident expectation that he will in his turn ren der the same, and then to disappoint, without ample reason, that just expectation. Masonry holds him also , by his solemn promise, to a purer life a nobler generosity, a more perfect charity of opin ion and action; to be tolerant,. catholic in his love for his race, ardent in his z eal for the interest of m ankind, the ad vancement and progress of humanity.

The world, the ancients be lieved, was governed by Se ven Secondary Causes; and these were the universal forces, know n to the Hebrews by the plural name ELOHIM. These forces, analogous and contrary one to t he other, produce equilibrium by their contrast s, and regulate the movements of the spheres. The Hebrews called them the Seven great Archangels, an d gave them names, each of which, being a combination of another word with AL, t he first Phoeni cian Nature- God, considered as the Prin ciple of Light, repr esented them as His manifestations. Other peoples assigned to these Spirits the governm ent of the Seven Planets then known, and gave them the names of their great divinities. So, in the Kabala, the last Seven Sephiroth constituted AT IK YOMIN, t he Ancient of Days; and these, as well as the Seven planet s, correspond with the Seven colors separated by the prism, and the Seve n notes of the musical octave. Seven is the sacred numb er in all theogoni es and all symbols, because it is composed of 3 and 4. It represents the magical power in it s full force.

The occu lt philosophy seems to ha ve been the nurse or the godmother of all religion s, the secret lever of all the intellectual fo rces, the key of all divine obscurities, and the ab solute Queen of So ciety, in the ages when it was exclusively reserved for the educ ation of the Priests and Kings. It had reigned in Pe rsia with the Magi, who perished one day as the masters of the world had perished, for having abused thei r power. It had endo wed India with the most marvellous traditions, a nd an incredible luxury of p oetry, grace, and terror in its emblems: it had civi lized Greece by the sounds of the lyre of Orp heus: it hid the principles of all the sciences , and of the whole pr ogression of the human spirit, in the audacious calculations of Pythagor as: fable teemed with its miracles; and history, when it under took to judge of this unknown power, co nfounded itself with fable: it shook or enfeebled empires by its oracles; made tyrants turn pale on their thrones, and ruled over all mi nds by means of curiosity or fear. To this science, said the crowd, nothing is impossi ble; it commands the elem ents, knows t he language of the planets, and controls the movements of the stars; the moon, at its vo ice, falls, reeking with blood, from Heaven; the dead rise upright on their graves, and shape into fatal words the wind that breathes through their skull s. Controller of Love or Hate, this science can at plea sure confer on human hear ts Paradise or Hell: it disposes at will of all form s, and distributes beauty or deformity as it pleases: it changes in turn, with the rod of Circe, men into brutes and animals in to men: it even disposes of Life or of Death, and can bes tow on its adepts riches by the transmutation of metals, and immortal ity by its quintessence and elixir, compounded of gold and light. This is what magic had been, from Zoroaster to Manes , from Orpheus to Apollonius Thyaneus; when positive Chri stianity, triumphing over the splendid dreams and gigantic aspirations of the school of Alex andria, publicly crus hed this philosophy with its anathemas, and co mpelled it to become more occult and more mysterious than ever. At the bottom of magic, neve rtheless, was science, as at the bottom of Christianity there was love; and in the Evangelic Symbols we see the incarnate WORD adored in its infancy by three magi whom a st ar guides (the ternary and the sign of the microcosm), and receiving from them gold, frankinc ense, and myrrh; another mysterious ternary, under the emblem whereof are allegorically contained the highest secrets of the Kabala. Christianity should not ha ve hated Magic; but human ignorance always fears the unknown. Science was obli ged to conceal itself, to avoid the impassioned aggressions of a blind love.

Among the sacred books of the Ch ristians are two works whic h the infallible church does not pretend to understa nd, and never attempts to explain,--the prophecy of Ezekiel and the Apocalypse ; two cabalistic clavicules , reserved, no doubt, in Heaven, for the exposition of the Magian kings; closed with Seven seals for all faithful believers; and perfe ctly clear to the unbeliever initiated in the occult sciences. For Christians, and in their opinion, the sci entific and magical cl avicules of Solomon are lost. Nevertheless, it is certain that, in the domain of intell igence governed by the WORD, nothing that is written is lost . Only those things which men cease to understand no longe r exist for them, at least as WORD; then th ey enter into the domain of enigmas and mystery. The mysterious founder of the Christian Church was sa luted in His cradle by the three Magi, that is to say by the hieratic ambassadors from the three parts of the known world, and from th e three analogical worlds of the occult philosophy. In the school of Alexandria , Magic and Christianity almo st take each other by the hand under the auspice s of Ammonius Saccos and Plat o. The dogma of Hermes is found almost entire in the wr itings attributed to Dionysius the Areopagite. Synesius traces the plan of a treatise on drea ms, which was subsequently to be commented on by Cardan, and composes hymns which migh t serve for the litur gy of the Church of Swedenborg, if a chur ch of illuminati co uld have a liturgy. To this epoch of ardent abstractions and impassion ed logomachies belongs the philosophical reign of Julian, an illumina tus and Initiate of the first order, who believed in the unity of God and the universal Dogma of the Trinity, and regretted the loss of nothing of the old world but its magnific ent symbols and too graceful images.

The Initiates ought to understa nd this, and, lest t he profane should over hear, Masonry never says too much. When Science had been overcome in Alexandria by the fa naticism of the murderers of Hypatia, it became Chri stian, or, rather it concea led itself under Christian disguises, with Am monius Synosius, and the author of the books of Dionysius the Areopagite. Then it was nece ssary to win the pardon of miracles by the appearances of superstiti on, and of science by a language unint elligible. Hieroglyphic writing was revive d, and pantacles an d characters were invented, that summed up a whole do ctrine in a sign, a whole series of tendencies and revelations in a word.

This lasted until the time of the Roman de la Rose, which also expresses the mysterious and magical meaning of the poem of Dante, borrowed from the High Kabalah, that immense and conealed source of the universal philosophy. It is not strange that man knows but little of t he powers of the human will, and imperfectly appreciate s them; since he knows nothing as to the na ture of the will and its mode of operation. That his own wi ll can move his arm, or compel another to obey him; that his thoughts, symbolically expressed by the signs of writing, can influence and lead other men, are mysteries as incomrehensib le to him, as that the will of Deity could effect the creaion of a Universe. The powers of the will are as yet chiefly indefinite and unknown. Whether a multitude of well-established phenomena are to be ascribed to the power of the will alone, or to magnetism or some other natural agent, is a point as yet unsettled; but it is agreed by all that a concentrated effort of the will is in ev ery case necessary to success. That the phenomena are real is not to be doubted, unless credit is no longer to be given to human testimony ; and if they are re al, there is no reas on for doubting the exercise heretofore, by many adepts, of the powers that were then termed magical.

This force was known to the ancients. It is a universal age wh ose supreme law is equilibrium; and whereby, if science can but learn how to control it, it will be possible to change the order of the Seasons, to produce in night the phenomena of day, to send a thought in an in stant round the world, to heal or slay at a distance, to give our words universal success, a make them reverberate everywhere.

To caress the weaknesses of an individual, is to possess ourself of him, and make of him an instrument in the order of the same errors or deprav ations.

There are miracles impossible to God Himself: absurd mira cles are so. If God could be absurd for a single instant, neither He nor the Univer se would exis t an instant afterward. To expect of the Divine Free-Will an effect whose cause is unacknowledged or does not ex ist, is what is termed tempting God. It is to precipitate one's self into the void.

Saint Thomas said, \"A thi ng is not just because God wills it, BUT GOD WILLS IT BECAUSE IT IS JUST.\" If he had deduced all the consequences of this fine thought, he would have disco vered the true Philos opher's Stone; t he magical elixir, to convert all the trials of the world into golden mercie s.

As it is impossible to make two and two be five and not four; as it is impossible to make a thing be and not be at the same time; so it is impossible for the Deity to make crime a merit, and love and gratitude crimes. So, too, it was impossible to ma ke Man perfect, with his bod ily senses and appetites, as it was to make his nerves susceptible of pleasure and not also of pain.

Each one of us does that. \"Seek,\" say the Holy Writings, \"and ye shall fi nd.\" Yet discussion is not forbidden; and without doubt the subject will be fully treated of in your hearing here after. Affirmation, negatio n, discussion,--it is by t hese the truth is attained. To explore the great Myster ies of the universe and seek to solve its manifold enigmas, is the chief use of Thought, and constitutes the principal distinction between Man and the animals. Accordingly, in a ll ages the Intellect has labored to understand and explain to itself the Nature of the supreme Deity. That one Reason and on e Will created and governed the Univ erse was too evident not to be at once adm itted by the philos ophers of all ages. It was the ancient religions that sought to mult iply gods. The Nature of th e One Deity, and the mode in which the Universe had its beginning, are questions that have always been the racks in which the human intellect has been tortured: and is chiefly with these that the Kabalists have dealt."},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"It is true that, in one sens e, we can have no actual kn owled of the Absolute Itself, the very Deity. Our means of obtaining what is commonly termed actual knowledge, are our senses only. If to see and feel be k nowledge, we have none of our own Soul of electricity, of magn etism. We see and feel and ta ste an acid or an alkali, and know something of the qualities of each; but it is only when we use them in combination with other substances, and learn their ef fects, that we really begin to know their nature. It is t he combination and ex periments of Chemistr y that give us a knowledge of the nature a nd powers of most animal and vegetable substances. As these are cognizable by inspection by our senses, we may partia lly know them by that alone: but the Soul, either of ourself or of another, being beyond that cognizance, can only be known by the ac ts and words which are its effects. Magnetism and electric ity, when at rest, are equally beyond the jurisdiction of the senses; and when they are in action, we see, feel, hear , taste, and smell only their effects. We do not know what they are, but onl y what they do. We can know the attributes of Deity only thr ough His manifestatio ns. To ask anything more, is to ask, not knowledge, but so mething else, for which we hav e no name. God is a Power; and we know nothing of any Power itself, but only its effects, re sults, and action, and what Reason teache s us by analogy. In these later days, in labori ng to escape from all material ideas in regard to Deity, we have so refined away our not ions of GOD, as to have no idea of Him at all. In struggling to regard Hi m as a pure immaterial Spirit, we have made the word Spirit synonymous with nothing, and can only say that He is a Some what, with certain attributes, such as Power, Wisdom, and Intelligence. To compare Him to LIGHT, would now be deemed not only unphilosophica l, but the equivalent of Atheism; and we find it necessary to excu se and pity the ancients for their inadequate and gross ideas of Deity, expressed in considering Him as the Li ght-Principle, the invisible essence or substance from which visible Light flows. Yet our own holy writings c ontinually speak of Him as Light; and therefore the Tsabeans and the Kabala may well be pardoned for doing the same; especially since they did not regard Him as the visible Light known to us, but as the Primordial Ether-Ocean from which light flows. Before the creation, did the Deity dwell alone in the Dark ness, or in the Light ? Did the Light co-exist with Him, or was it created, after an eternity of darkness? and if it co-existed, was it an effluence fr om Him, filling all space as He also filled it, He and the Light at the same time fillin g the same place and every place ?

It WAS, before all things whatever, produced, created, formed, and made by Emanation; and in it was neither Time, Head, or Beginning; since it always ex isted, and remains forever, without commencement or end.\" \"Before the Emanations fl owed forth, and created th ings were created, the Supreme Light was infinitely extended, and fi lled the whole WHER E; so that with reference to Light no vacuum could be affirmed, nor any unoccupied space; but the ALL was filled with that Light of the Infinite, thus extend ed, whereto in every regard was no end, inasmuch as nothing was, except that extend ed Light, which, with a certain single and simple equalityy, was ever ywhere like unto itself.\" AINSOPH is called Light, sa ys the Introduction to the Sohar because it is impossible to express it by any other word. To conceive of God as an ac tuality, and not as a mere non- su bstance or name, which involved non-existence, the Kabala, like the Egyptians, imagined Him to be \"a most occult Light, \" AUR: not our material and visibl e Light, but t he Substance out of which Light flows, the fire , as relative to its heat and fl ame. Of this Light or Ether, the Sun was to the Tsabeans the only manifestation or out-shining, and as such it was worshipped, and not as the type of dominion an d power. God was the Phos Noeton, the Light cogn izable only by the Intellect, the Light-Principle, the Light Ether, from which soul s emanate, and to which they return. Light, Fire, and Flame, with the Phoenicians, we re the sons of Kr onos. They are the Trinity in the Chaldaean Oracle s, the AOR of the Deity, m anifested in flame, that issues out of t he invisible Fire. In the first three Persi an Amshaspands, Lords of L IGHT, FIRE, and SPLENDOR, we recognize the AOR, ZOHAR, and ZAYO, Li ght, Splendor, and Brightness, of the Kabalah.

In other words, they are THE VERY SUBSTANC E of light, in the Deity: Fire, which is that light, li mited and furnis hed with attributes, so that it can be revealed, but yet remains unre vealed, and its sple ndor or out-shini ng, or the light that goes out from the fire.

Philo calls it the \"U niversal Light,\" which loses a portion of its purity and splendor in descending fr om the intellectual to the sensible world, manifesting itself outwardly from the Deity; and the Kabalah represents that only so much of the Infinite Light flowed into t he circular void prepared for creation within the Infinite Light and Wisdom, as could pass by a canal like a li ne or thread. The Sephiroth, emanating from the Deity, we re the rays of His splendor. The Chaldean Oracles said: \"T he intellect of th e Generator, stirre d to action, out- spoke, forming within itself , by intellection universals of every possi ble form and fashion, which issued out, fl owing forth from the One Source . . . For Deity, impersonated as Donlin ion, before fabricat ing the manifold Un iverse, posited an intellected and unchangeable universal, the impr ession of the fo rm whereof goes forth through the Universe; and that Universe formed and fashioned accordingly, becomes visibly beautif ied in infinitely varying type s and forms, t he Source and fountain whereof is one.... Intellectual conceptions a nd forms from the Generative source, succeeding each other, considered in re lation to ever-pro gressing Time, and intimately partaking of THE PRIMAL ETHER or FIRE; but yet all these Universals and Primal Types and Ideas flowed forth from, and are part of, the first Source of the Generative Po wer, perfect in itself.\" The Chaldeans termed the Su preme Deity ARAOR, Father of Light. From Him was supposed to flow the light above the world, which illu minates the heavenly regions. This Light or Fire was cons idered as the Symbol of t he Divine Essence, extending itself to inferior spiritual natures. Hence the Ch aldean oracles say: \"The Father took from Himself, and did not conf ine His proper fire within His intellectual potency:\" . . \"All things are begott en from one Fire.\" The Tsabeans held that all inferior spir itual beings were em anations from the supreme Deity; and therefor e Proclus says: \"The progre ssion of the gods is one and continuous, proceeding downwa rd from the intelligible and latent unities, and terminating in the last parti tion of the Divine cause.\" It is impossible to speak cl early of the Divinity. Whoever attempts to express His attributes by the help of abs tractions, confines himself to negatives, and at once loses sight of his ideas, in wandering throug h a wilderness of words.

We satisfy ourselves with neg ativing in the Deity everything that constitutes existence, so far as we ar e capable of conceiving of existence. Thus He becomes to us logically noth ing, Non-Ens. The Ancients saw no difference be tween that and Atheism, and sought to conceive of Him as somethi ng real. It is a necessity of Human Nature. The theol ogical idea, or rather non-idea, of the Deity, is not shared or appreciated by the unlearned. To them, God will alwa ys be The Father Who is in Heaven, a Monarch on His Throne, a Be ing with human feel ings and human sympathies, angry at their mi sdeeds, lenient if they re pent, accessible to their supplications. It is the Humani ty, far more than the Divinity, of Ch rist, that makes the mass of Christians worship Him, far more than they do the Father. \"The Light of the Substance of The Infinite,\" is the Kaba listic expre ssion.

It does not appear that they a scribed to Light any of the qualities of matter. But modern Science defines it to be a flood of part icles of matter, fl owing or shot out from the Sun and Stars, and moving throu gh space to come to us.

What has become of the immense aggregat e of particles that have reached the earth since the crea tion? Have they increased it s bulk? Why cannot chemistry detect and analyze them? If matter, why can they travel only in right lines? No characteristic of matter belongs to Light, or Heat, or flame or to Galvanism, Electricity, and Magnetism. The electric spark is light, an d so is that produced by the flint, when it cuts off par ticles of steel. Iron, melted or heated, radiat es light; and insects, infusoria, and decay ed wood emit it.

Profoundly ignorant of the nature of these mighty agents of Divi ne Power, we conceal our ignorance by wo rds that have no meaning; and we might well be asked why Light may not be an effl uence from the Deity, as ha s been agreed by all the religions of all the Ages of the World.

The H ebrew books were written only to recall to memory the traditions; and they were wr itten in Symbols unintellig ible to the Profane.

When the Infinite God w illed to emit what were to flow forth, He contracted Himself in the centre of His light, in such manner that most inte nse light should recede to a certain circumference, and on all sides upon itself. And this is the first contraction, and termed Tsemsum. ADAM KADMON, the Primal or First Man, is the first Aziluthic emanant from the Infinite Light, immitted into the evacuated Space, and from which, afterward, all the other degrees and systems had th eir beginnings. It is call ed the Adam prior to all the first.

But now, as the Infinite Light would be too excellent and great to be borne and endured, except through the medium of this Adam Kadmon, its mo st Secret Nature preventing this, its illuminating light had again to emanate in streams out of itself, by certain apertures, as it were, like windows, and which are termed the ears, eyes, nostrils, and mouth. The light proceeding from this Adam Kadmon is i ndeed but one; but in proportion to its remoteness from the place of outflowing, and to the gr ades of its descent, it is more dense. From the word ATSIL, to emanate or flow fo rth, comes the wo rd ATSILOTH or Aziluth, Emanation, or the system of Emanants. Wh en the primal space was evacuated, the surrounding Ligh t of the Infinite, and the Light immitt ed into the void, did not touch each other; but the Light of the Infinite flowed into that void through a line or certain slender canal; and that Light is the Emanat ive and emitting Principle, or the out-flow and origin of Emanation: but the Light within the vo id is the emanant subordinate; and the two cohere only by means of the aforesaid line. Aziluth means specifically and principally the first system of the four Olamoth, worlds or systems; which is then ce called the Aziluthic World The ten Sephiroth of the general Aziluthi c system are ten Nekudoth or Points. AINSOPH, AENSOPH, or AY ENSOPH, is the title of the Cause of Causes, its meaning being \"endless, \" because there is no limit to Its loftiness, and nothing can comprehend it. Sometimes, al so, the name is applied to KETHER, or the CROWN, the first emanation, because t hat is the Throne of the Infinite, that is, its first and highest Seat, than wh ich none is higher, and because Ainso ph resides and is concealed therein: hence it rejoices in the same name."},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"Before that anything was, says the Emech Hammelech, He, of His mere will, proposed to Himself to make worlds . . . but at that time there wa s no vacant space for worlds; but all space was filled with the light of His Substance, which He had with fixed limits placed in the centre of Himself, a nd of the parts whereof, and wherein, He was thereafter to effect a fo lding together.

Of that exhilarati on, it had also b een said, was generated the determination of forms, by which determination t he Infinite determined them wi thin Himself, as if by saying: \"Let this Sphere be the appointed place, wherein le t all worlds be created !\" He, by radiating and coruscati ng, effected the poi nts, so that thei r sparkling should smite the eyes like lightning.

And when he again asce nded he left behind him the productive li ght of the letter He, and thereof was constitu ted another Sphere, within the Sphere of Splendor; which lesser Sphere is termed in Sohar KETHER AILAH, CO RONA SUMMA, The Supreme Crown, and also ATIKA DE ATIK IM, Antiquus Antiquum, The Ancient of A ncients, and even AILIT H' AILIT, Causa Causarum, the Cause of Causes. But the Crown is very far smaller than the Sphere of Spl endor, so that with in the latter an immense unoccupied place a nd space is still left. The BETH AL OHIM says: Before the Infinite God, the Supreme and First Good, form ed objectively within Himself a particular conception, definite, limited, and the ob ject of intellection, and gave form and shape to an intellectual conception a nd image. HE was alone, companionless, without form or similitude, utterly without Ideal or Figure . . . It is forbidden to make of Him any figure w hatever, by any image in the world, neither by the letter He nor by the lett er Yod, nor by an y other letter or po int in the world. But after He had formed this I dea, the particular conception limited and intelligible, which the Ten Numerations ar e, of the medium of tran smission, Adam Kadmon, the Primal or Supreme Man, He by that medium descen ded, and may, through that Idea, be called by the name IHUH, and so creat ed things have cognizance of Him, by means of His proper likeness."},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"Woe unto him who makes God to be like unto any mode or attribute whatever, even were it to one of His own; an d still more if he make Him like unto the Sons of Men, whose elements are earthly, and so are consumed and perish ! There can be no conception had of Him, except in so far as He manifests Himself, in exercising dominion by a nd through some attribute . . . Abstracted from this, there can be no attribute, co nception, or ideal of Him. He is comparable only to the Sea, filling some great rese rvoir, its bed in the earth , for example; wherein it fashions for itself a certain concavity, so that thereby we may begin to compute the dimensions of the Sea itself. For example, the Spring and S ource of the Ocean is a so mewhat, which is one. If from this Source or spring there issues forth a certain fountain, propor tioned to the space occupied by the Sea in that hemispherica l reservoir, such as is the letter Yod, there the Source of Sp ring is the first somewhat, and the fountain that flows forth from it is the sec ond. Then let ther e be made a great reservoir, as by excavation, and let this be called the Ocean, an d we have the thir d thing, a vessel [Vas]. Now let this great rese rvoir be divided into seven beds of rivers, that is, into seven oblong reservoirs, so th at from this ocean the waters may flow forth in seven rivers; and the Source, Fountain, a nd Ocean thus make ten in all. The Cause of Causes made ten Numeration s, and called the Source of Spring KETHER, Corona, the Crow n, in which the idea of circular ity is involved, for there is no end to the out-flow of Ligh t; and therefore He called th is, like Himself, endless; for this also, like Him, has no similitude or co nfiguration, nor hat h it any vessel or receptacle wherein it ma y be contained, or by means whereof any possible cognizance can be had of it. After thus forming the Crown, He constitute d a certain smaller re ceptacle, the letter Yod, and filled it from that source; and this is called \"The Fountain gushing with Wisdom,\" and, mani fested in this, He called Himself WISE, and the vessel He called HAKEMAH, Wi sdom, Sapientia. Then He also constituted a gr eat reservoir, which He call ed the Ocean; and to it He gave the name of BINAH, Unde rstanding, Intelli gentia. In this He characterized Himself as Intelligent or Conceiver. HE is indeed the Ab solutely wise and Intelligent, but Hakemah is not Absolute Wisdom of itself, but is wi se by means of Binah, who fills Himself from it, and if this supply were taken from it, would be dry and unintelligent.

The INTRODUCTION says: It is said in many places in the So har, that all things th at emanate or are created have their root above. Hence al so the Ten Sephiroth have their root above, in the world of the garment, with the very Substance of HIM. And AINSOPH had full consciousness and appreciation, prior to their actual exis tence, of all the Grades and Impersonations containe d unmanifested within Hims elf, with regard to the essence of each, and its domination then in potency . . . When He came to the Sephirah of the Impe rsonation Malakoth, which He then contained hidden within Himself, He concluded within himself that therei n worlds should be framed; since the scale of the first nine Se phiroths was so ccnstituted, that it was neither fit nor necessary for worlds to be fr amed from them; for all th e attributes of these nine Superior Sephiroth could be assigned to Himself, ev en if He shoul d never operate outwardly; but Malakoth, which is Empire or Dominion, could not be attributed to Him, unless He ruled over other Existences; whence fr om the point Malakoth He produced all the worl ds into actuality. These circles are ten in numb er. Originated by points, they expanded in circular shape. Ten Circles, under the mystery of the ten Sephiroth, and between them ten Spaces; whence it appears that the sphere of Splendor is in the centre of the space Malakoth of the First Occult Adam. The First Adam, in t he ten circles above th e Splendor, is call ed the First occult Adam; and in each of these spaces are formed many thousand worlds. The first Adam is involved in the Primal Ether, and is the a nalogue of the world Binah. Again the Introduction repeat s the first and second descent of Yod into the vacated space, to make the light t here less great and subt ile; the constituti on of the Tehiru, Splendor, from t he light left behind ther e by him; the communic ation of Light to him by the female letter He; t he emission by him of that Light, wit hin the sphere of Splendor, and the forma tion thereof, within t he sphere, \"of a cert ain sphere called the Supreme crown,\" Corona Summa, KETH ER, \"wherein were contained, in potence, all the remaining Nume rations, so that they were not distinguishable from it.

And this Light is the Substance of the poin t Kether; for the WILL of God is the Soul of all things that are. The Ainsophic Light, it had said, was infini te in every directi on, and without end or limit. To prevent it from fl owing into and re-f illing the quasi-vacant space, occupied by an infinitely less Sple ndor, a partition between the greater and lesser Splendor was necessary; and this part ition, the boundary of the sphere of Splendor, and a like one bounding the sphere Kether, we re called Vessels or Receptacles, containing, including, and encl osing within themselves the light of the sphere. Imagine a sea of pe llucid water, and in t he centre of it a spher ical mass of denser and darker water. The outer surface of this sphere, or its limits every way, is the vessel containing it. The Kaba lah regards the vessels \"as by their nature somewhat opaque, and not so splendid as the lig ht they enclose.\" The contained Light is the Soul of the vessels, and is acti ve in them, like the Human Soul in the human body. The Light of the Emanative Princi ple [Ainsoph] inheres in the vessels, as their Life, in ternal Light, and Soul. . . Keth er emanated, with its Very Substance, at the same time as Substance and Vessel, in like manner as the flame is annexed to the live coal, and as the So ul pervades, and is within, the body. All the Numerations were poten tially contained in it. And this potentiality is thus explai ned: When a woman conceives, a Soul is immediately sent into the embryo which is to become the infant, in which Soul are then, potentially, all the members and veins of the body, which af terward, from that potency of the Soul, becom e in the human body of the child to be born. Then the wisdom of God comm anded that these Nu merations potentia lly in Kether, should be produced from potent iality into actuality, in order that worlds might consist; and HE directed Y od again to descend, and to enter into and shine within Kether, and then to re-asc end: which was so do ne. From which ill umination and re- ascension, all the other num erations, potentially in Ket her, were mani fested and disclosed; but they continued still compacted together, rema ining within Kether in a circle. When God willed to produce the other emanations or numerat ions from Kether, it is added, HE sent Y od down again, to the u pper part of Kether, one-half of him to remain without and o ne half to penet rate within the sphere of Kether. Then HE sent the letter Vav into the Sp lendor, to pour out its light on Yod: and thus,-- Yod received light from Vav, and thereby so dire cted his countenance that it should illuminate and confer exce eding great energy on Hakemah, which yet remained in"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"Kether; so giving it the facu lty to proceed forth therefrom; and that it might collect and contain within itsel f, and there reveal, all the othe r eight numerations, until that time in Kether. The sphere of Ket her opened, and ther eout issued Hakemah, to remain below Kether, containing in itself all the other numerations. By a similar process, Binah, illuminated within Hakemah by a second Yod, \"issued forth out of Hakemah, hav ing within itself the Se ven lower Numerations.\" And since the vessel of Bin ah was excellent, and coruscated with rays of the color of sapphire, and was so nearly of the same color as the vessel of Hakemah that there was scarcely any differ ence between them, hence it would not quietly remain below Hakemah, but ro se, and placed itself on his left side. And because the light from above profus ely flowed into and accumulated in the vessel of Hakemah, to so great an extent that it overflowed, and escaped, coruscating, outside of that vessel, and, flowing off to the left, communicated potency and increase to t he vessel of Binah .... fo r Binah is female .... Binah, therefore, by means of this energy that flowed into it fr om the left side of Hakemah, by virtue of the second Yod, came to posse ss such virtue and potency, as to project beyond itself the Seven remaining vessels co ntained within itself, and so emitted them all, contin uously, one after the other . . . all connec ted and linked one with the other , like the lin ks of a chain. Three points first emanated, one under the ot her; Kether, Hakema h, and Binah; and, so far, there was no c opulation. But afterward the positions of Hakemah and Binah changed, so that they were side by side, Kether remaining abov e theml; and then conjunction of the Ma le and Female, AB A and IMMA, Father and Mother, as points. He, from Whom all emanated, created Adam Kadm on, consisting of all the worlds, so that in him should be somewhat from those above, and somewhat from those below. Hence in Him was NEPHESCH [PSYCHE, anima infima, the lowest spiritual part of man, Soul], from the world ASIAH, which is one letter He of the Tetragrammaton; RUACH [SPIRI TUS, anima media, the ne xt higher spiritual part, or Spirit], from t he world YEZIRAH, which is th e Vav of the Tetragrammaton; NESCHAMAH [the highes t spiritual part, m ens or anima superio r], from the world BRIAH, which is the other letter He ; and NESCHAMAH LENESC HAMAH, from the world ATSILUTH, which is the YOD of the Te tragrammaton. And these letters [the Sephir oth] were changed from the spherica l form into the form of a person, the symbol of which person is the BALA NCE, it being Male and Female . . . Hakemah on o ne side, Binah on the other, and Kether ov er them: and so Gedulah on one si de, Geburah on the other, and Tephareth under them. The Book Omschim says: sone hold that the ten Sephiroth succeeded one another in ten degrees, one above the other, in regular gradation, one c onnected with the"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"other in a direct line, from the highest to the lowest. Others hold that they issued forth in three lines, paralle l with each other, one on the right hand, one on the left, and one in the middle; so that, beginning with the hi ghest and going down to the lowest, Hakemah, Khas ed [or Gedulah], and Netsach ar e one over the other, in a perpendicular line, on the right hand; Bin ah, Geburah, and H od on the left; and Kether, Tephareth, Ye sod, and Malakoth in the middle : and many hold that all the ten subsist in circles, one within the other, and all homocentric. It is also to be noted, that the Sephirothic tables cont ain still another numeration, sometimes called also a Sephirah, which is called Daath, cognition. It is in the middle, below Hakemah and Binah, and is the result of the conjunction of these two. To Adam Kadmon, the Idea of the Univer se, the Kabalah assi gns a human form. In this, Kether is the cranium, Hakemah and Binah the two l obes of the brain, Gedulah and Geburah the two arms, Te phareth the trunk, Nets ach and Hod the thighs, Yesod the male organ, and Malkuth the female organ, of generation. Yod is Hakemah, and He Bi nah; Vav is Tephareth, a nd the last He, Malkuth. The whole, say the Books Mysterii or of Occultation, is thus summed up: The intention of God The Blessed was to form Impersonations, in order to diminish the Light. Wherefore HE constitu ted, in Macroprosopos, Adam Kadmon, or Arik Anpin; three Heads. The first is ca lled, \"The Head whereof is no cognition\"; the second, \"The Head of that which is non-exist ent\" and the third, \"The Very Head of Macroprosopos\"; and these three are Coro na, Sapientia, and In formatio, Kether, Hakemah, and Binall, existent in the Co rona of the World of Emanation, or in Macroprosopos; and th ese three are called in the Sohar ATIKA KADISCHA, Senex Sanctissimus, The Most Holy Ancient. But th e Seven inferior Royalties of the first A dam are called \"The Anci ent of Days\"; and this Ancient of Days is the internal part, or Soul, of Macroprosopos. The human mind has never st ruggled harder to understand and explain to itself the process of creation, and of Di vine manifestation, and at the same ti me to conceal its thoughts from all but the initiated, than in the Kabalah. Hence, much of it seems at first like jargon. Macropros opos or Adam K admon is, we have said, the idea or intellectual aggregate of the whole Universe , include and cont ained unevolved in the manifested Deity, Himself ye cont ained unmanifested in the Absolute. The Head, Kether \"whereof is no cognition,\" is t he Will of the Deity, or the Deity as Will. Hakemah, the head \"of that which is non-existent,\" the Ge nerative Power of begetting or producing Thought; yet in the Deity, not in action, and therefore non- existent. Bina \"the very or actual head\" of Macropros opos, is the productive intellectual capacity, whic h, impregnated by Hakemah, is to produce the Thought. This Thought is Daath; or ra ther, the result is Intellecti on, Thinking; the Unity, of which Thoughts are the manifold outflowings. This may be illustrated by a comparison. Pain, in the human being, is a feeling or sensation. It must be produc ed. To produce it, there must be, not only the capacity to produce it, in the nerves, but also the power of genera ting it by means of that"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"capacity. This generative Power, the Passive Capacit y which produces, and the pain produced, are like Hake mah, Binah, and Daath. The four Worlds or Universals, Aziluth, Br iah, Yetzirah, and As iah, of Emanation, creation, Formation, and Fabrication, are another enigma of the Kabalah. The first three are wholly within the Deity. The first is the Univer se, as it exists potentially in the Deity, determined and im agined, but as yet wholly formless and undeveloped, except so far as it is co ntained in His Emanations. T he second is the universe in idea, distinct within the Deity, but not inve sted with forms; a simp le unity. The third is the same Universe in potence in t he Deity, unmanifested, but invested with forms,--the idea developed in to manifoldness and indivi duality, and succession of species and individuals; and the fourth is the potentiali ty become the Actuality, the Universe fabricated, and exis ting as it ex ists for us. The Sephiroth, says t he Porta Coelorum, by the virtue of their Infinite Emanator, who uses them as a workman uses his tools, and who operates with and through them, are the cause of exis tence of everything crea ted, formed, and fashioned, employing in their pr oduction certain media. But th ese same Sephiroth, Persons and Lights, are not creat ures per se, but ideas, and Rays of THE INFINITE, which, by different gradations, so descended from the supreme Source as still not to be severed from It; but It, th rough them, is extended to t he production and government of all Entities, and is th e Single and Perfect Univer sal Cause of All, though becoming determinate for this or the other operation, thr ough this or th at Sephiroth or MODE. God produced all things by His Intellect and Will and fr ee Determination. He willed to produce them by the medi ation of His Sephir oth, and Persons ..by which He is enabled most perfectl y to manifest Hims elf; and that the more perfectly, by producing the causes themselves, and the Causes of Causes, and not merely the viler effects. God produced, in the first Or iginate, all the re maining causates. For, as He Himself is most simply One, and from One Si mple Being One only can immediately proceed, hence it results that from the First Supreme Infini te Unity flowed forth at the same time All and One. O ne, that is, in so far as fl owing from the Most Simple Unity, and being like unt o It; but also All, in so far as, departing from that perfect Singleness which can be measur ed by no ot her Singleness, it be came, to a certain extent, manifold, thougll still Abso lute and Perfect. Emanation, savs the same, is the Resulting disp layed from the Unresulting, the Finite from the Infinite, the Manifold and Composite fr om the Perfect Single and Simple, Potentiality from that which is Infi nite Power and Act, th e mobile from that which is perennially permanen t; and therefore in a more imperfect and diminished mode than His Infinite Perfection is. As the First Cause is all things, in an unresulting and Infinite mode, so the Entities that flow from Him are the First Causes, in a resulti ng and finite mode. THE NECESSARY ENTITY, subsis ting of Itself, as It cannot be dissevered into the manifold, yet becomes, as it were, multiplied in the Causates, in respect of their"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"Nature, or of the Subsistences, Vessels, and openings assig ned to them; whereby the Single and Infinite E ssence, being inclosed or co mprehended in these limits, bounds, or externalnesses, ta kes on Itself Definiteness of dimension, and becomes Itself manifold, by the mani foldness of these envelopes. As man [the unit of Humanity ] is a microcosm, so Adam Kadmon is a macrocosm, containing all the Causates of the First Cause ..as the Material Man is the end and completion of all creation, so in the Div ine Man is the beginni ng thereof. As the inferior Adam receives all thin gs from all, so t he superior Adam supp lies all things to all. As the former is the princi ple of reflected light, so the la tter is of Direct Light. The former is the terminus of th e Light, descending; the la tter its terminus, ascending. As the Inferior man ascends from the lowest matter even to the First Cause, so the Superior Adam descends from the Simple and Infinite Ac t, even to the lowest and most attenuated Potence. The Ternary is the bringing back of duality to unity. The Ternary is the Principle of Number, because, bringing back the binary to unity, it restores to it the same quantity whereby it h ad departed from unity . It is the first odd number, containing in itself the first ev en number and the unit, which are the Father and Mother of all Numbers; and it has in it self the beginning, middle, and end. Now, Adam Kadmon emanated from the Absolu te Unity, and so is himself a unit: but he also descends and fl ows downward into his own Nature, and so is duality. Again, he returns to the Unity, which he hath in himself, and to The Highest, and so is the Ternary and Quaternary. And this is why the Essential Name has fo ur letters,--three di fferent ones, and one of them once repeated; since the first He is the wife of the Yod, and the second He is the wife of the Vav. Those media which manifest the First Cause, in Himsel f profoundly hidden, are the Sephiroth, which emana te immediately from that First cause, and by Its Nature have produced and do co ntrol all the rest. These Sephiroth were put forth from the One First and Si mple, manifesting His Infinite Goodness. They are the mirrors of His Truth, and th e analogues of His Supremest Essence, the Idea s of His Wisdom, and the r epresentations of His will; the receptacles of His Pote ncy, and the instru ments with which He operates; the Treasury of His Felicity, the dispensers of His Beni gnity, the J udges of His Kingdom, and reveal His Law; and finally, the Denomi nations, Attributes, and Names of Him Who is above all and the Cause of all..the ten categories, wherein all things are contained; the un iversal genera, which in them selves include all things, and utter them outwardly .... the Second Causes, whereby the First Cause effects, preserves, and govern s all things; the rays of the Di vinity, whereby all things are illumined and manifest ed; the Forms and Ideas and species, out whereof all things issue forth; the Souls and Potencies, whereby essence, life, and mo vement are given to all things; the St andard of times, w hereby all things are measured; the"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"incorporeal Spaces which, in themselv es, hold and inclose the Universe; the Supernal Monads to which al l manifolds are referred, a nd through them to The One and Simple; and finally the Formal Perfec tions, flowing, fort h from and still connected with the One Em inent Limitless Perfection , are the Causes of all dependent Perfections, and so il luminate the elementary Inte lligences, not adjoined to matter, and the in tellectual Souls, and the Cele stial, Elemental and Element- produced bodies. The IDRA SUTA says: He the Most Holy Hidden El dest, separates Himself, and is ever more and more separated from all that ar e; nor yet does He in ve ry deed separate Himself; because all things cohere with Him and HE with All. HE is All that is, the Most Holy Eldest of All, t he Occult by all po ssible occultations. When HE takes shape, HE pr oduces nine Lights, which sh ine forth from Him, from His outforming. A nd those Lights outshine from Him and emit flames, and go forth and spread out on every side ; as from one elevated Lamp the Rays are poured forth in every direction, and these Rays thus diverging, are found to be, when one approaching has cogni zance of them, but a single Lamp. The Space in which to create is fi xed by THE MOST HOLY ANCIENT, and illuminated by His inflowing, which is the Light of Wisd om, and the Beginning from which manifestation flows. And HE is conformed in three Heads, wh ich are but one Head; and these three are extended into Micropros opos, and from them shines out all that is. Then this Wisdom instituted investiture with form, w hereby the unmanifested and informous became manifested, putting on form; and produced a ce rtain outflow. When this Wisdom is thus ex panded by flowing forth, then it is called \"Father of Fathers,\" the whole Universe of Things being containe d and comprehended in it. This Wisdom is the principl e of all things, and in it beginning and end are found. The Book of the Abstruse, sa ys the Siphra de Zeni utha, is that wh ich describes the equilibrium of the Balance. Be fore the Balance was, face did not look toward face. And the Commentary on it says: The Scales of the Balance are designated as Male and Female. In the Spiritual wo rld Evil and Good are in equilibrio, an d it will be restored, when of the Evil Good becomes, until all is Good. Also this other world is called the World of th e Balance. For, as in the Balance are two scales, one on either side and the beam and needle betwe en them, so too in this world of restoration, the Numerations are arranged as distinct persons. For Hakemah is on the right hand, on the side of Gedulah, and Binah on the left, on t he side of Geburah; and Kether is th e beam of the Balance above them in t he middle. So Gedulah or Khased is on one hand, and Gebur ah on the other, and under these Tephareth; and Netsach is on one side, and Hod on t he other, and under these Yesod."},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"The Supreme Crown, which is the Ancient Most Holy, the most Hidden of the Hidden, is fashioned, within the occult Wisdom, of both sexes, Male and Female.

Wisdom and the Mother of Inte llection go forth at once and dwell toge ther; for when the Intellectual Power emanates , the productive So urce of intellecti on is included in Him. Before Adam Kadmon was fashioned into Male and Female, and the state of equilibrium introduced, the Father and Mother did not look each other in the face; for the Father denotes most perfect Love, and the Mother most perfect Rigor; and she averted her face. There is no left [female], says the Idra Rabba, in the Ancient and Hidden One; but His totality is Right [male]. The totality of things is HUA, HE, and HE is hidden on every side. Macroprosopos [Adam Kadm on] is not so near unto us as to speak to us in the first person; but is designated in the third person, HUA, HE. Of the letters it says: Yod is male, He is female, Vav is both. In Yod are three Yods, the upper and the lower a pex, and Vav in the middle. By the upper apex is denoted th e Supreme Kether; by Vav in the middle, Hake mah; and by the lower apex, Binah. The IDRA SUTA says: The Universe was out-formed in the form of Male and Female . Wisdom, pregnant with all that is, when it fl owed and shone forth, shone al together under the form of male and female.

All Categories whatever go fo rth from Hakemah; and in it are cont ained all things, unmanifested; and t he aggregate of all things, or t he Unity in which the many are, and out of which all flow, is the Sacred Name IHUH. In the view of the K abalists, all individual s are contained in spec ies, and all species in genera, and all particulars in a Universal, which is an idea, abstracted from all consideration of indivi duals; not an aggregate of individuals; but, as it were, an Ens, Entity or Being, ideal or in tellectual, but none the less real; prior to any individual, containing them all, and out of which they are al l in succession evolved. If this discontents you, re flect that, supposing the theo ry correct, that all was originally in the Deity, and that the Universe has proceeded forth from Him, and not been created by Him out of nothing, the idea of the Un iverse, existing in the Deity before its out-flow, must have been as real as the Deity Himself. The whole Human race, or Humanity, for exampl e, then existed in the Deit y, not disti nguished into individuals, but as a Unit, out of which the Manifold was to flow. Everything actual must al so first have been possible, before having actual existence; and this po ssibility or potentiality was to the Kabalists a real Ens. Before the evolvement of the Universe , it had to exist pot entially, the whole of it, with all its individuals, included in a sing le Unity. This was the Idea or Plan of the Universe; and this had to be form ed. It had to emanate from th e Infinite Deity, and be of Himself, though not His Very Self. Geburah, Severity, the Sephirah opposite to and conjoined sexual ly with Gedulah, to produce Tephareth, Harmony and Beaut y, is also call ed in the Kabalah \"Judgment,\" in which term ar e included the idea s of limitation and conditioning, which often seems, indeed, to be its principal sense; wh ile Benignity is as often styled Infinite. Thus it is ob scurely taught that in ever ything that is, not only the Finite but also the Infinite is present; and that th e rigor of the stern law of limitation, by which everything below or beside the Infinite Absolute is limited, bounded, and conditioned, is temper ed and modified by the grace, which so relaxes it that the Infinite, Unlimited, Unconditio ned, is also everywhere present ; and that it is thus the Spiritual and Material Natu res are in equilibrio, Good everywhere counterbalancing Evil, Light everywhere in e quilibrium with Darkness: fr om which again results the Universal Harmony of things. In the vacant space effected for creation, there at last remained a faint vestige or tr ace of Ainsophic Light, of th e Light of the Substance of the Infinite. Man is thus both human and divi ne: and the apparen t antagonisms in his Nature are a real equilibrium, if he wi lls it shall be so; fr om which results the Harmony, not only of Li fe and Action, but of Virtue and Perfection. To understand the Kaba listic idea of the Sephiroth, it must be borne in mind that they were assigned, not only to the world of Em anation, Aziluth, bu t also to each of the other worlds, Briah, Jezirah, and As iah. They were not on ly attributes of the Unmanifested Deity, not only Himself in li mitation, but His actual manifestations, or His qualities made apparent as modes; a nd they were also qualities of the Universal Nature--Spiritual, Mental, and Material, produced and made existent by"},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"the outflow of Himself. In the view of the Kaba lah, God and the Universe were One and in the One General, as the type or source, were in cluded and involved, and from it have been evolved and issued forth, the manifold and all particula rs. Where, i ndeed, does individuality begi n? Is it the Hidden Sour ce and Spring alone th at is the individual, the Unit, or is it the flowin g fountain that fills the ocean, or the ocean itself, or its waves, or the drops, or th e vaporous particles, that are the individuals? The Sea and the River--these are each One; but the drops of each are many. The tree is one; but its leaves are a multit ude: they drop with the frosts , and fall upon his roots; but the tree st ill continues to gr ow, and new leaves come a gain in the Spring. Is the Human Race not the Tree, a nd are not individual men the leaves? How else explain the force of will and sympa thy, and the dependenc e of one man at every instant of his life on others, e xcept by the oneness of the race? The links that bind all created things together are the lin ks of a single Unity, and the whole Un iverse is One, developing itself into the manifold. Obtuse commentators have sa id that the Kabalah assigns sexual characteristics to the very Deity. There is no warrant for su ch an assertion, anywhere in the Sohar or in any commentary upon it. On the contrary, the whole doc trine of the Kabalah is based on the fundament al proposition, that the Very Deity is Infinite, everywhere extended, without limitati on or determinat ion, and theref ore without any conformation whatever. In order to commence the proc ess of creation, it was necessary for Him, first of al l, to effect a vacant space within Himself. To this end the Deity, whose Nature is approximately expressed by describing Him as Light filling all space, formless, limi tless, contracts Hi mself on all sides from a point within Himself, and thus effects a quas i-vacant space, in which only a vestige of His Light remains; and into this circular or sp herical space He immi ts His Emanations, portions of His Light or Natu re; and to some of these, sexual characteristics are symbolically assigned. The Infinite first limi ts Himself by flowing forth in the shape of Wi ll, of determination to act. This Will of the Deity, or the Deit y as will, is Kether, or the Crown, the first Sephirah. In it are included all other Emanations. This is a philosophical necessity. The Infinite does not first will, and t hen, as a sequence to, or consequence of, that determination, subsequen tly perform. To will and to act must be, with Him, not only simultaneous, but in reality the same . . Nor does He, by His Omniscience, learn that a particular action will be wise, and then, in conseq uence of being so convinced, first determine to do the act, and then do it. His Wisdom and His Will, also, act simultaneously; and, with Him, to deci de that it was wise to create, was to create. Thus His will contains in itself all the S ephiroth. This will, determining Him to the exercise of intellection, to thought, to fram e the Idea of the Universe, caused the Power in Him to excite the in tellectual Faculty to exerci se, and was that Power. Its SELF, which had flowed fo rth from Ainsoph as Will , now flows forth as the Generative Power to beget intellectual ac tion in the Intellectual Faculty, or Intelligence, Binah. The Act itself, the Tho ught, the Intellection, producing the Idea, is Daath; and as the text of the Siphra de Zeniutha says, The Power and Faculty, the Generative and Producti ve, the Active and Passive , the Will and Capacity, which unite to produce that Ac t of reflection or Thought or Intellection, are always in conjunction. As is elsewher e said in the Kabal ah, both of them are contained and"},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"essentially involved in the result. And th e Will, as Wisdom or In tellectual Power, and the Capacity or Faculty, are really the Father and Mother of all that is; for to the creation of anythi ng, it was absolutely necessary that The Infinite should form for Himself and in Himself, an id ea of what HE willed to pr oduce or create: and, as there is no Time with Him, to will was to create, to plan was to Will and to create; and in the Idea, t he Universe in potence, the un iversal succession of things was included. Thenceforward all was me rely evolution and development. Netsach and Hod, the Sev enth and Eighth S ephiroth, are usually called in the Kabalah, Victory and Glory. Netsach is the perfect Success, which, with the Deity, to Whom the Future is presen t, attends, and to His creatures is to result, from the plan of Equilibrium everywhere adopted by Him. It is the reconciliation of Light and Darkness, Good and Evil, Free-will and Necessity, God's omnipotence and Man's liberty; and the ha rmonious issue and resu lt of all, without wh ich the Universe would be a failure. It is the inherent Perfection of the Deity, m anifested in Hi s Idea of the Universe, and in all the depar tments or worlds, sp iritual, mental, or material, of that Universe; but it is that Pe rfection regarded as the successful resu lt, which it both causes or produces and is , the perfection of the plan being its success. It is the prevailing of Wisdom over Accident; and it, in turn , both produces and is the Glory and Laudation of the Great Infi nite Contriver, whose plan is thus Successful and Victorious. From these two, which are one ,--from the excellence and perfection of the Divine Nature and Wisdom, considered as Success a nd Glory, as the o pposites of Failure and Mortification, resu lts what the Kabalah, styling it Yesod, Foundati on or Basis, characterizes as the Genera tive member of the Symbol ical human figure by which the ten Sephiroth are represen ted, and from this flows Malakoth, Empire, Dominion, or Rule. Yesod is the Stab ility and Permanence, which would, in ordinary language, be said to result from the perfection of the I dea or Intellectual Universal, out of which all particulars are evolved; from the success of that scheme, and the consequent Glory or Self-Satisfaction of the Deity; but which Stability and Permanence that Perfection, Su ccess, and Glory really Is; si nce the Deity, infinitely Wise, and to Whom the Past , Present, and Future we re and always will be one Now, and all space o ne HERE, had not to aw ait the operation an d evolution of His plan, as men do the result of an experiment, in order to see if it would succeed, and so to determine whether it should stand, and be stable and permanent, or fall and be temporary. Its Perfection was its Success; His Glory, its permanence and stability: and the Attr ibutes of Permanence and Stability belong, like the others, to the Universe, material, mental , spiritual,and real , becalise and as th ey belong to the Infinite Himself. This Stability and Perma nence causes continuance and generates succession. It is Perpetuity, and continuity without solution; and by this continuous succession, whereby out of Deat h comes new Life, out of disso lution and resolution comes reconstruction, Necessity and Fatality result as a consequence: that is to say, the absolute control and dominion (Malakoth) of The Infinite Deity over all that He produces, and over chance and accident; and the absolu te non-existence in the Universe, in Time and in Space, of any other powers or influences than those which, proceeding from Him, are and cannot not be perfectly submissi ve to His will. This results, humanly speaking ; but in reality, t he Perfection of the plan, which is its"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"success, His glory, and its st ability, is also His Absolu te Autocracy, and the utter absence of Chance, Accident, or Antagonism. And, as the Infinite Wisdom or Absolute Reason rules in the Di vine Nature itself, so also it does in its Emanations, and in the worlds or systems of Spirit, So ul, and Matter; in each of which there is as little Chance or Accident or Unreasoning Fate, as in the Divine Nature unmanifested. This is the Kabalistic theory as to each of the four wo rlds;-- 1st, of the Divine Nature, or Divinity itself, quantitatively limite d and determi ned, but not manifested into Entities, which is the world of Emanati on, 2d, of the first En tities, that is, of Spirits and Angels, which is the world of creation; 3d, of the first forms, souls, or psychical natures, which is th e world of Formation or Fash ioning; and, 4th, of Matter and Bodies, which is the world of Fabricati on, or, as it were, of manufacture. In each of these the Deity is pr esent, as, in, and through th e Ten Sephiroth. First of these, in each, is Kether, t he Crown, ring, or circlet, th e HEAD. Next, in that Head, as the two Hemisphere s of the Brain, are Hakemah and Binah, and thei r result and progeny, Daath. These thr ee are found also in the Spiritual world, and are universals in the psychical and material world, producing the lo wer Sephiroth. Then follow, in perfect Equilibriu m, Law and Equity, Justice and Mercy, th e Divine Infinite Nature and the Human Finite Nature, Good and Evil, Li ght and Darkness, Benignity and Severity, the Male and the Female again, as Hakema h and Binah are, mutually tempering each other, an d by their intimate union pr oducing the othe r Sephiroth. The whole Universe, and all th e succession of entities and events were present to The Infinite, before any ac t of creation; and His Benignity and Leniency, tempering and qualifying the law of rigorous Justice and inflexible Retribution, enabled Him to create: because, but fo r it, and if He could not but have administered the strict and stern law of justice, that would have compel led Him to dest roy, immediately after its inception, the Universe He purposed to crea te, and so would have prevented its creation. This Lenie ncy, therefore, was, as it were, the very essence and quintessence of the Permanenc e and Stability of the plan of Creation, and part of the Very Nature of the Deity. The Kabala h, therefore, designa tes it as Light and Whiteness, by which the Very Substance of Deity is symbolized. With this agree Paul's ideas as to Law and Grace; for Paul had studied th e Kabalah at the feet of Gamaliel the Rabbi. With this Benignity , the Autocracy of the domini on and control of the Deity is imbued and interpene trated. The former , poured, as it were, into the la tter, is an integral and essentia l part of it, and causes it to gi ve birth to the succession and continuance of the Universe . For Malakoth, in the K abalah, is female, and the matrix or womb out of wh ich all creation is born. The Sephiroth may be ar ranged as on page 770. The Kabalah is the primitive tradition, and its entirety rests on the single dogma of Magism, \"the visible is for us the proportional measur e of the invisible.\" The Ancients, observing that e quilibrium is in ph ysics the universal law, and that it results from the appare nt opposition of two forces, c oncluded from t he physical to the metaphysical equilibri um, and thought t hat in God, that is to say, in the first living and active cause, tw o properties necessary to each other, should be"},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"recognized; stability and movement, necessity and liberty, order di ctated by reason and the self-rule of Supreme Will, Justice, and Love, and consequently Severity and Grace, Mercy or Benignity. The idea of equilibrium am ong all the impersona tions; of the male on one side, and the female on the other, with the Supreme Will, which is also the Absolute Reason, above each two, holdi ng the balance, is, according to the Kabalah, the foundation of all religions and all sciences, the primary and immutable idea of things. The Sephiroth are a triple triangle and a circle, the idea of the Ter nary explained by the balance and multiplied by itself in the Su premacy and absolute control of the Divine Will in all things, domain of the Ideal; then t he realization of this Idea in forms. Unity can only be manifested by the Binary . Unity itself and th e idea of Unity are already two. The human unity is made complete by the right and le ft. The primitive man was of both sexes. The Divinity, one in its esse nce, has two essent ial conditions as fundanlental bases of its existence--Necessity and Liberty. The laws of the Supreme Reason necessita te and regulate liberty in God, Who is necessarily reas onable and wise. Knowledge supposes the binary . An object known is indis pensable to the being that knows. The binary is the generator of Society and the law. It is also the number of the gnosis, a word adopted in lieu of Science, and expressing only the idea of cognizance by intuition. It is Unity, multiplying itself by it self to create ; and therefore it is that the Sacred Sym bols make Eve issue from the very chest of Adam. Adam is the human Tetragram, which is summed up in the mysterious Yod of the Kabalah, image of the Kabalistic Phallus. Add to this Yod, the ternary name of Eve, and you form the name of Jehova, t he Divine Tetragram , the transcendent Kabalistic and magical word: Thus it is that Unity, complete in the fe cundity of the Ternary, forms, with it, the Quaternary, which is the key of al l numbers, movem ents, and forms. The Square, turning upon itself , produces the circle equal to itself, and the circular movement of four equal ang les turning around one point, is the qua drature of the circle. The Binary serves as a measur e for Unity; and t he relation of equ ality between the Above and the Below, forms with them the Ternary. To us, Creation is Mechani sm: to the Ancien ts it was Generat ion. The world- producing egg figures in all cosmogonies; and modern sci ence has discovered that"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"all animal production is ovi parous. From this idea of ge neration came the reverence everywhere paid the image of generative power, which fo rmed the Stauros of the Gnostics, and the philosophical Cross of the Masons. Aleph is the man; Beth is t he woman. One is the Principle; two is the Word. A.'. is the Active; B.'. is the Passive. Unit y is Boaz, and the Binary is Jachin. The two columns, Boaz and Jachin, explain in the Kaba lah all the mysteries of natural, political, and religious antagonism. Woman is man's creation; and universal creation is the fema le of the First Principle. When the Principle of Existe nce made Himself Creator, He produced by emanation an ideal Yod; and to make ro om for it in the plenitude of the un created Light, He had to hollow out a pit of shadow, equal to the dime nsion determined by His creative desire; and attrib uted by Him to the ideal Yod of radiating Light. The nature of the Active Princi ple is to diffuse: of the Pa ssive Principle, to collect and make fruitful. Creation is the habitation of the Creator-Word. To create, the Generative Power and Productive Capacity must unite, th e Binary become Unity again by the conjunction. The WORD is the First-BEGOTTE N, not the first created Son of God. SANCTA SANCTIS, we repeat agai n; the Holy things to th e Holy, and to him who is so, the mysteries of the K abalah will be holy. Seek and ye shall find, say the Scriptures: knock and it shall be opened unto y ou. If you desire to find and to gain admission to the Sa nctuary, we have sa id enough to show yo u the way. If you do not, it is useless for us to say more, as it has b een useless to say so much. The Hermetic philosophers also drew their doctri nes from the Kabalah; and more particularly from the Treatise Beth Alohim or Domus Dei, known as the Pneumatica Kabalistica, of Rabbi Abra ham Cohen Irira, and the Tr eatise De Revolutionibus Animarum of Rabbi Jitz-chak Lorja. This philosophy was conceale d by the Alchemists under th eir Symbols, and in the jargon of a rude Chemistr y,--a jargon incomprehensible and absurd except to the Initiates; but the key to which is within your reach; and the ph ilosophy, it may be, worth studying. The labors of the human intellect ar e always interesting and instructive. To be always rich, always young, and never to die: such hasbeen in all times the dream of the Alchemists. To change into gold, lead, mercury, and all the ot her metals; to possess the universal medicine and e lixir of life; such is the proble m to be resolved, in order to accomplish this desire and realizethis dream."},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"Like all the Myst eries of Magism, the Secrets of \"t he Great Work\" have a threefold signification: they are reli gious, philosophica l, and natural. The philosophal gold, in religion, is the Absolu te and Supreme Reason: in philosophy, it is the Truth; in visible nature, the Sun; in the subterranean and mineral world, t he most perfect and pure gold. It is for this that the purs uit of the Great Work is call ed the Search fo r the Absolute; and the work itself, t he work of the Sun. All the masters of the Scienc e admit that it is impossibl e to attain the material results, unless there are f ound in the two higher Degree s all the analogies of the universal medicine and of the philosophal stone. Then, they say, the work is simple, easy, and inexpensiv e; otherwise, it consumes fruitlessly the fortune and lives of the seekers. The universal medicine for the Soul is the Supreme Re ason and Absolute Justice; for the mind, mathematical and practical Truth; for t he body, the Quintessence, a combination of light and gold. The prima materia of the Gr eat Work, in the Superior Wo rld, is enthusiasm and activity; in the intermediate world, intelligence and indu stry; in the lower world, labor: and, in Scienc e, it is the Sulphur, Mercury, and Salt, whic h by turns volatilized and fixed, compose the AZOTH of the Sages. The Sulphur corresponds with the elementary form of the Fi re Mercury with the Air and Water; and Salt with the Earth. The Great Work is, above all th ings, the creation of man by himself; that is to say, the full and entire conquest whic h he effects of his facult ies and his future. It is, above all, the perfect emancipation of hi s will, which assure s him the universal empire of Azoth, and the dom ain of magnetism, that is, complete power over the universal Magical agent. This Magical agent, which th e Ancient Hermetic philos ophers disguis ed under the name of \"Prima Materia,\" de termines the forms of the mo difiable Substance; and the Alchemists said that by means of it they could attain the transmutation of metals and the universal medicine. There are two Hermetic opera tions, one spiritua l, the other mate rial, dependent the one on the other. The whole Hermetic Science is contai ned in the dogma of Hermes, engraven originally, it is said, on a t ablet of emerald. Its sentences that relate to operating the Great Work are as follows:"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"\"Thou shalt separate the earth from the fire, the subtile from the gross, gently, with much industry. \"It ascends from earth to Heaven, and again de scends to earth, and receives the force of things above and below. \"Thou shalt by this means possess the glory of the whole world, and therefore all obscurity shall flee away from thee. \"This is the potent force of all force, for it will overco me everything subtile, and penetrate everything solid. \"So the world was created.\" All the Masters in Alchem y who have written of the Great Work, have employed symbolic and figurat ive expressions; being constrained to do so, as well to repel the profane from a work that would be dangerous for them, as to be well understood by Adepts, in revealing to them the whole world of analogi es governed by the single and sovereigr dogma of Hermes. So, in their language , gold and silver ar e the King and Quee n, or the Sun and Moon; Sulphur, the flying Eagle; Mercury, the Ma n-woman winged, bearded, mounted on a cube, and crowne d with flames: Matter or Salt, the winged Dragon; the Metals in ebulliti on, Lions of different colors; and, finally, t he entire work has for its symbols the Pelic an and the Phoenix. The Hermetic Art is therefore, at the sa me time a religion , a philosophy, and a natural science. As a religion, it is that of th e Ancient Magi and th e Initiates of all ages; as a philosophy, we may find its principles in the sch ool of Alexan dria and the theories of Pythagoras; as a science, we must inquire for its processes of Paracelsus, Nicholas Fl amel, and Raymond Lulle. The Science is a real one only for those who admit a nd understand th e philosophy and the religion; and its proc ess will succeed only for th e Adept who has attained the sovereignty of will, and so become the King of the elementary world: for the grand agent of the operation of the Sun, is that force describ ed in the Symbol of Hermes, of the table of emer ald; it is the universal m agical power; the spiritual, fiery, motive power; it is the Od, accord ing to the Hebr ews, and the Astral light, according to others. Therein is the secret fire , living and philosop hical, of which all the Hermetic philosophers speak with the most mysterious reserve: the Universal Seed, the secret whereof they kept, and which they represented only under the figure of the Caduceus of Hermes. This is the grand Hermetic arcanum. What the Adepts ca ll dead matter are bodies as found in nature; living matters are substances a ssimilated and magnetized by the science and will of the operator."},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"So that the Great Work is more than a chemical op eration; it is a re al creation of the human word initiated into the power of the Word of God. The creation of gold in the Great Work is effect ed by transm utation and multiplication. Raymond Lulle says, that to make gold, one must have gold and mercury; and to make silver, silver and merc ury. And he adds: \"I mean by mercury, that mineral spirit so fine and pure th at it gilds even the seed of gold, and silv ers that of silver.\" He meant by this, either electr icity, or Od, the astral light. The Salt and Sulphur serve in the work only to prepare t he mercury, and it is to the mercury especially that we mu st assimilate, and, as it we re, incorporate with it, the magnetic agent. Paracelsus, Lulle, and Flamel alone seem to have perfectly known this mystery. The Great Work of Hermes is, therefore, an operation e ssentially magical, and the highest of all, for it suppose s the Absolute in Science and in Will. There is light in gold, gold in light, and light in all things. The disciples of Hermes, befo re promising t heir adepts the elixir of long life or the powder of projection, advi sed them to seek for the Philosophal Stone. The Ancients adored the Sun, under the form of a black Stone, called Elagabalus, or Heliogabalus. The faithf ul are promised, in the Apocalypse, a white Stone. This Stone, says the Masters in Alchemy, is the true Sa lt of the philosophers, which enters as one-third in to the composition of Azoth. But Azoth is, as we know, the name of the grand Hermetic Agent, and the true philosophica l Agent: wherefore they represent their Salt under the form of a cubical Stone. The Philosopllal Stone is t he foundation of the Absolu te philosophy, the Supreme and unalterable Reason. Be fore thinking of the Metall ic work, we must be firmly fixed on the Absolute princi ples of Wisdom; we must be in possession of this Reason, which is the touchsto ne of Truth. A man who is the slave of preiudices will never become the King of Nature and the Master of tr ansmutations. The Philosophal Stone, therefore, is necessary above all th ings. How shal l it be found? Hermes tells us, in his \"Tabl e of Emerald,\" we must s eparate the subt ile from the fixed, with great care and extreme at tention. So we ough t to separate our certainties from our beliefs, and make perfectly distin ct the respective domains of science and faith; and to comprehend that we do not kn ow the things we believe, nor believe anything th at we come to know ; and that thus the e ssence of the things of Faith are the unknown and indefinite, while it is prec isely the contrary with the things of Science. Whence we shall conclude, that Science rests on reason and experience, and Faith has for its bases se ntiment and reason. The Sun and Moon of the Alchem ists concur in perfecting an d giving stability to the Philosophal Stone. They corr espond to the two columns of the Temple, Jachin and Boaz. The Sun is the hierogly phical sign of Truth, because it is the source of Light;"},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"and the rough Stone is the symbol of Stabi lity. Hence the Mediaeval Alchemists indicated the Philosophal Stone as the first means of maki ng the philos ophical gold, that is to say, of transformi ng all the vital powers figured by the six metals into Sun, that is, into Truth an d Light; which is the first and indispensable op eration of the Great Work, which leads to the secondary adaptation, and enable s the creators of the spiritual and livi ng gold, the possessors of the tr ue philosophical Salt, Mercury, and Sulphur, to discover, by the analogies of Natu re, the natural and palpable gold. To find the Philosophal Sto ne, is to have discovered the Absolute, as all the Masters say. But the Absolute is that which admits of no errors, is the Fixed from the Volatile, is the Law of t he Imagination, is the very necessity of Being, is the immutable Law of Reason and Truth. The Absolute is that which IS. To find the Absolute in the In finite, in the Indefinite, and in the Finite, this is the Magnum Opus, the Great Work of the Sages, which Hermes called the Work of the Sun. To find the immovable bases of true religious Faith, of Philosophical Truth, and of Metallic transmutation, this is the secret of Hermes in its entirety, the Philosophal Stone. This stone is one and manifold; it is decomposed by Analysis, and re-compounded by Synthesis. In Analysis, it is a powder, the powder of pr ojection of the Alchemists; before Analysis, and in Sy nthesis, it is a stone. The Philosophal Stone, say th e Masters, must not be ex posed to the atmosphere, nor to the gaze of the Profane; but it must be kept concealed and carefully preserved in the most secret place of the laboratory, and the possessor must always carry on his person the key of the place where it is kept. He who possesses the Grand Arcanum is a genui ne King, and more than a king, for he is inaccessible to all fear and all empty hopes. In all ma ladies of soul and body, a single particle from the pr ecious stone, a single grai n of the divine powder, is more than sufficient to cure him. \"Let him hear, who hath ears to h ear !\" the Master said. The Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury are but the acce ssorial element s and passive instruments of the Great Work. All depends, as we hav e said, on the internal Magnet of Paracelsus. The ent ire work consists in projec tion: and the projection is perfectly accomplished by th e effective and realizable understanding of a single word. There is but a single im portant operation in the work; th is consists in Sublimation, which is nothing else, acco rding to Geber th an the elevation of dry matter, by means of fire, with adhes ion to its pr oper vessel. He who desires to attain to the underst anding of the Gran d Word and the possession of the Great Secret , ought carefully to read the Hermetic philosophers, and will undoubtedly at tain initiation, as others have done; but he must take, for the"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"key of their allegories, t he single dogma of Hermes, contained in his table of Emerald, and follow, to class his acquisitions of knowledge and direct th e operation, the order indicated in the Kabal istic alphabet of the Tarot. Raymond Lulle has said that, to make gold, we must first have gold. Nothing is made out of nothing; we do not absolutely crea te wealth; we incr ease and multiply it. Let aspirants to science we ll understand, then, that neither the j uggler's tricks nor miracles are to be asked of the adept. The Hermetic sci ence, like all the real sciences, is mathematically demonstrable. Its results, ev en material, are as rigorous as that of a co rrect equation. The Hermetic Gold is not only a true dogm a, a light without Sh adow, a Truth without alloy of falsehood; it is also a material gold, re al, pure, the most precious that can be found in the mines of the earth. But the living gold, the living sulphur, or the tr ue fire of the phil osophers, is to be sought for in the house of Mercury. This fire is fe d by the air: to express its attractive and expansive pow er, no better comparison can be used than that of the lightning, which is at first only a dry a nd earthly exhalation, united to the moist vapor, but which, by self-exhalation, takes a fiery nature, acts on the humidity inherent in it, which it attr acts to itself and transmutes in its natur e; after which it precipitates itself rapidly to ward the earth, whit her it is attract ed by a fixed nature like unto its own. These words, in form enigmat ic, but clear at bottom, di stinctly express what the philosophers mean by their Mercury, fe cundated by Sulphur, and which becomes the Master and regenerator of the Salt. It is the AZ ORTH, the universal magnetic force, the grand magical agent , the Astral light, the light of life, fecund ated by the mental force, the intellectu al energy, which they compar e to sulphur, on account of its amnities with the Divine fire. As to the Salt, it is Absolute Matter. What ever is matter contai ns salt; and all salt [nitre] may be converted into pure gold by the combin ed action of Sulphur and Mercury, which sometimes act so rapidly, that the transmutation may be effected in an instant, in an hour, without fatigue to the opera tor, and almost without expense. At other times, and according to the more refrac tory temper of the atmospheric media, the operation requi res several days, several months, and sometimes even several years. Two primary laws exist in nature, tw o essential laws, which produce, by counterbalancing each other, the universal equilibriu m of things. These are fixedness and move ment, analogous, in phi losophy, to Truth an d Fiction, and, in A bsolute Conception, to Necessi ty and Liberty, which are th e very essence of Deity. The Hermetic philosophers gave the name fi xed to everything ponderable, to everything that tends by its natural to central repose and immobility; they term volatile everything that mo re naturally and more readil y obeys the law of movement; and they form their stone by analysis, that is to say, by the vo latilization of the Fixed, and then by synthesis , that is, by fixing the vola tile, which they effect by applying to the fixed, which t hey call their salt, the sulphu rated Mercury, or the light"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"of life, directed and made omnipotent by a Soverei gn Will. Thus they master entire Nature, and their stone is found wherever there is sa lt, which is the reason for saying that no substance is foreign to the Great Work, and that even the most despicable and apparently vile matters may be changed into gold , which is true in this sense, that they all contain the original saltprinciple, re presented in our emblems by the cubical stone. To know how to extract from all matter the pure salt concea led in it, is to have the Secret of the Stone. Wheref ore this is a Saline stone, which the Od or universal astral light decomposes or re -compounds: it is single and manifold; for it may be dissolved like ordinar y salt, and incorporat ed with other substa nces. Obtained by analysis, we might term it the Universal Sublimate: found by way of synthesis, it is the true panacea of the ancient s, for it cures all maladies of soul and body, and has been styled, par-excellence, the medicine of all nature . When one, by absolute initiation, comes to control the forces of the universal agent, he always has this stone at his disposal , for its extraction is then a simple and easy o peration, very distinct from the metallic pr ojection or realization. This stone, when in a state of sublimation, must not be ex posed to contact with the at mospheric air, which might partially dissolve it and deprive it of its virtue; nor could its emanations be inhaled without danger. The S age prefers to preserve it in it s natural envelopes, assured as he is of extracting it by a single effort of hi s will, and a single application of the Universal Agent to the envel opes, which the Kabalists call cortices, the shells, bark, or integuments. Hieroglyphically to express this law of prudence, they gave their Mercury, personified in Egypt as Hermanubis, a dog's head; and to thei r Sulphur, represented by the Baphomet of the Temp!e, that goat's head which brought into such disrepute the occult Mediaeval associations. Let us listen for a few mom ents to the Alchemists th emselves, and endeavor to learn the hidden meaning of their mysterious words. The RITUAL of the Degree of Scottish Elder MASTER, and Knight of Saint Andrew, being the fourth Degree of Ramsay, it is said upon the titl e-page, or of the Reformed or Rectified Rite of Dresden, has these passages: \"O how great and gl orious is the presence of t he Almighty God wh ich gloriously shines from betw een the Cherubim! \"How adorable and ast onishing are the rays of that glorious Ligh t, that sends forth its bright and bril liant beams from the Holy Ark of Allianc e and Covenant! \"Let us with the deepest veneration and devotion adore the grea t Source of Life, that Glorious Spirit Who is the Most Merciful and Benefi cent Ruler of the Universe and of all the creatu res it contains! \"The secret knowledge of the Grand Scottish Master rela tes to the combination and transmutation of different su bstances; where of that yo u may obtain a clear idea and proper understanding, you are to know that all matter and all material"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"substances are composed of combinations of three several substances, extracted from the four el ements, which three substances in combination are, Salt, Sulphur, and Spirit. The first of these produces Soli dity, the second Softness, and the third the Spiritual, vaporous particles. These th ree compound substanc es work potently together; and therein consists the true process for the transmutation of metals. \"To these three substances al lude the three golden basins, in the first of which was engraved the letter M.'., in the second, the lett er G.'., and in th e third nothing. The first, M.'., is the initial le tter of the Hebrew word Malakh, which signifies Salt; and the second, G.'., of the Hebr ew word Geparaith, which signifies Sul phur; and as there is no word in Hebrew to express the vaporous and intangible Spir it, there is no letter in the third basin. \"With these three principal su bstances you may effect th e transmutation of metals, which must be done by means of the five points or rules of the Scottish Mastership. \"The first Master's point sh ows us the Brazen Sea, wher ein must always be rain- water; and out of this rain -water the Scottish Masters extract the first substance, which is Salt; which salt must afterw ard undergo a seven-fold manipulation and purification, before it wil l be properly prepar ed. This sevenfol d purification is symbolized by the Seven Step s of Solomon's Temple, whic h symbol is furnished us by the first point or rule of the Scottish Masters. \"After preparing the first s ubstance, you are to extract the second, Sulphur, out of the purest gold, to which mu st then be added the pu rified or celestia l Salt. They are to be mixed as the Art direct s, and then placed in a vessel in the form of a SHIP, in which it is to remain, as the Ark of Noah wa s afloat, one hundr ed and fifty days, being brought to the first dam p, warm degree of fire, that it may putrefy and produce the mineral fermentation This is the second point or rule of the Scottish Masters.\" If you reflect, my Brother, th at it was impossible for any one to imagine that either common salt or nitre could be extracted from rain-water, or sul phur from pure gold, you will no doubt suspect that some secret meani ng was concealed in these words. The Kabalah considers the i mmaterial part of man as threefold, consisting of NEPHESCH, RUACH, and NESC HAMAH, Psyche, Spiritus , and Mens, or Soul, Spirit, and Intellect. Ther e are Seven Holy Palaces, Seven Heavens and Seven Thrones; and Souls are purif ied by ascending through Sev en Spheres. A Ship, in Hebrew, is Ani; and the same word means I, Me, or Myself. The RITUAL, continues: \"Multiplying the substance th us obtained, is the third o peration, which is done by adding to them the animat e, volatile Spirit which is do ne by means of the water of the Celestial Salt, as well as by the Salt , which must daily be added to it very carefully, and strictly observin g to put neither too much nor too little; inasmuch as, if you add too much, you will destroy that gr owing and multiplying substance; and if too little, it will be se lf-consumed and dest royed, and shrink away, not having sumcient substantiality for its preservation. This third point or rule of the Scottish"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"Masters gives us the emblem of the building of the To wer of Babel, used by our Scottish Masters, because by irregularity and want of due proportion and harmony that work was stopped; and the wo rkmen could proceed no further. \"Next comes the fo urth operation, repr esented by the Cubica l Stone, whose faces and angles are all equal. As soon as the work is brought to the necessary point of multiplication, it is to be submitted to the third Degr ee of Fire, wherei n it will receive the due proportion of the strength and substance of the metallic pa rticles of the Cubical Stone; and this is the fourth point or rule of the Scottish Masters. \"Finally, we come to the fift h and last operation, indicated to us by the Flaming Star. After the work has become a duly-proportioned subs tance, it is to be subjected to the fourth and strong est Degree of fire, wherein it mu st remain thr ee times twenty- seven hours; until it is thor oughly glowing, by which mean s it becomes a bright and shining tincture, wherewith the lighter metals may be ch anged, by the use of one part to a thousand of the metal. Wherefor e this Flaming Star sh ows us the fifth and last point of the Scottish Masters. \"You should pass practically th rough the five points or ru les of the Master, and by the use of one part to a th ousand, transmute and ennobl e metals. You may then in reality say that your age is a thousand years.\" In the oration of t he Degree, the foll owing hints are given as to its true meaning: \"The three divisions of the Te mple, the Outer Court, Sanct uary, and Holy of Holies, signify the three Prin ciples of our Holy Order, whic h direct to the knowledge of morality, and teach those most practical virtues that ought to be practised by mankind. Therefore the Seven Steps whic h lead up to the Outer Court of the Temple, are the emblem of the Seven-fold Light wh ich we need to possess, before we can arrive at the height of knowledge, in which consist the ulti mate limits of our order. \"In the Brazen Sea we are sym bolically to purify ourselves from all pollutions, all faults and wrongful actions, as well thos e committed through error of judgment and mistaken opinion, as those in tentionally done; inasmuch as they equally prevent us from arriving at the knowle dge of True Wisdom . We must thoroughly cleanse and purify our hearts to t heir inmost recesses, before we can of right contemplate that Flaming Star, which is the emblem of the Divine and Glor ious Shekinah, or presence of God; before we may dare approac h the Throne of Supreme Wisdom.\" In the Degree of The True Ma son [Le Vrai Macon] , styled in the title-page of its Ritual the 23d Degree of Masonry, or the 12th of the 5th cla ss, the Tracing-board displays a luminous Triangle, with a great Yod in the centre. \"The Triangle,\" says the Ritual, \"repre sents one God in thre e Persons; and the great Yod is the initial le tter of the last word. \"The Dark Circle represents the Chaos , which in the beginning God created."},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"\"The Cross within the Circle , the Light by means whereo f He developed the Chaos. \"The Square, the four Elements into which it was resolved. \"The Triangle, again, t he three Principles [Salt, Su lphur, and Mercury], which the intermingling of th e elements produced. \"God creates; Nature prod uces; Art multiplies. Go d created Chaos; Nature produced it; God, Nature, a nd Art, have perfected it. \"The Altar of Perfumes indicates the Fire that is to be applied to Nature. The two towers are the two furnaces, moist and dry, in which it is to be worked. The bowl is the mould of oak that is to inclose the philosophal egg. \"The two figures surmounted by a Cross are the two vase s, Nature and Art, in which is to be consummate d the double marriage of th e white woman with the red Servitor, from which marriage will spring a most Potent King. \"Chaos means universal matter, formless, but susceptible of all forms. Form is the Light inclosed in the seeds of all species; and its home is in the Universal Spirit. \"To work on universal matter , use the internal and extern al fire: the four elements result, the Principia Principiorum and Inmedi ata; Fire, Air, Water, Earth. There are four qualities of these el ements--the warm and dry, the cold and moist. Two appertain to each element: The dry and cold, to the Earth; the cold and moist, to Water; the moist and warm, to the Air; and the warm and dry, to Fire: whereby the Fire connects with the Earth; all the elements, as Herm es said, moving in circles. \"From the mixture of the four Elements and of their four qualities, result the three Principles,--Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt. Th ese are the philosophica l, not the vulgar. \"The philosophical Mercury is a Water and SPIRIT, which dissolves and sublimates the Sun; the philosoph ical Sulphur, a fire and a SOUL, which mollifies and colors it; the philosophical Salt, an Earth and a BODY, which coagu lates and fixe s it; and the whole is done in the bosom of the Air. \"From these three Principles result the four Elements duplic ated, or the Grand Elements, Mercury, Sulphur, Sa lt, and Glass; two of whic h are volatile,--the Water [Mercury] and the Air [Sul phur], which is oil; for all subs tances liquid in their nature avoid fire, which takes from the one [water] and bu rns the other [oil ]; but the other two are dry and solid, to wit, the Salt, wherein Fire is cont ained, and the pure F,arth, which is the Glass; on both of which the Fire has no othe r action than to melt and refine them, unless one makes use of the liquid alkali; fo r, just as each element consists of two qualities, so these great duplicated Elemen ts partake, each of two of the simple elements, or, more prope rly speaking, of all the four, according to the greater or less degree of each,--the Mercury partaking more of the Water, to which it is assigned; the Oil or Sulphur, more of the Air; the Salt , of the Fire; and the"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"Glass, of the Earth; which is found, pure a nd clear, in the c entre of all the elementary composites, and is the last to di sengage itself from the others. \"The four Elements and three Principles reside in all the Compou nds, Animal, Vegetable, and Mineral; but more potently in some than in others. \"The Fire gives them Movem ent; the Air, Sensat ion; the Water, Nutriment; and the Earth, Subsistence. \"The four duplicated Elemen ts engender THE STONE, if one is careful enough to supply them with the proper quan tity of fire, and to combi ne them according to their natural weight. Ten parts of Ai r make one of Water; ten of Water, one of Earth; and ten of Earth, one of Fire; the whole by the Active Sy mbol of the one, and the Passive Symbol of the other, whereby the conversion of the Elements is effected.\" The Allusion of the Rit ual, here, is obviously to the f our Worlds of th e Kabalah. The ten Sephiroth of the worl d Briah proceed from Malako th, the last of the ten Emanations of the world Aziq uth; the ten Sephiroth of the world Yezirah, from Malakoth of Briah; a nd the ten of the world Asiah, fr om Malakoth of Yezirah. The Pass-word of the Degree is given as Metralon, which is a corruption of METATRON, the Cherub , who and Sandal phon are in the Kabal ah the Chief of the Angels. The Active an d Passive Symbols are the Male and Female. The Ritual continues: \"It is thereby eviden t that, in the Great Work, we rnust employ ten parts of philosophical Mercury to one of Sun or Moon. \"This is attained by Solu tion and Coagulati on. These words m ean that we must dissolve the body and coagulate the spirit; which operations ar e effected by the moist and dry bath. \"Of colors, black is the Eart h; white, the Wate r; blue, the Air; and red, the Fire; wherein also are invo lved very great secrets and mysteries. \"The apparatus employed in 'T he Great Work' consists of the Moist bath, the Dry bath, the Vases of Nature and Art, the bowl of oak, lutu m sapientiae, the Seal of Hermes, the tube, the physica l lamp, and the iron rod. \"The work is perfected in seventeen philo sophical months, accord ing to the mixture of ingredients. The benefits reaped from it are of two kinds--one af fecting the soul, and the other the body. The fo rmer consist in knowing God, Nature, and ourself; and those to the body are wealth and health. \"The Initiate traverses Heav en and Earth. Heaven is t he World manife st to the Intelligence, subdivided into Paradise and Hell; Earth is the World manifest to the Senses, also subdivided into the Ce lestial and that of the Elements. \"There are Sciences specially connected wi th each of these.

The World cognizable by the Intellect has the Hermetic Theology and t he Kabalah; the Cele stial Astrology; and that of the Elements, Chemistry, which by its decomposi tions and separations, effected by fire, reveals all the most hidden secrets of Nature, in the three kinds of Compound Substances. This last science is styled 'Hermetic,' or 'T he operating of the Great Work.'\" The Ritual of the Degree of Kabalistic and Hermetic Rose has these passages: \"The true Philosophy, known and practised by Solomon, is the basis on which Masonry is founded. \"Our Ancient Masons have concealed from us the most important po int of this Divine Art, under hieroglyphi cal characters, which are but enigmas and parables, to all the Senseless. the Wi cked, and t he Ambitious. \"He will be supremel y fortunate, who shall, by ard uous labor, discover this sacred place of deposite, w herein all naked the sublime Truth is hidden; for he may be assured that he ha s found the True Light , the True Felicity, the True Heavenly Good. Then may it truly be said that he is o ne of the True Elect; for it is the only real and most Sublime Scienc e of all those to which a mort al can aspire: his days will be prolonged, and his soul fr eed of all vices and co rruption; into which\" (it is added, to mislead, as if from fear too much would be disclos ed), \"the human race is often led by indigence.\" As the symbolism of the Hall and the language of the ritual mutually explain each other, it should be no ted here, that in this Degree the column s of the hall, 12 in number, are white variegated with black and red. The hangi ngs are black, and over that crimson. Over the throne is a great E agle, in gold, on a black ground. In the centre of the Canopy the Blazing Star in gol d, with the letter Yod in its centre. On the right and left of the throne are the Sun in gold and the M oon in silver. The th rone is ascended to by three Steps. The ha ll and ante-room are each lighted by ten lights, and a single one at the entrance. The colors, black, white, and crimson appear in the clothing; and the Key and Balance are among the symbols. The duty of the Second Grand Prior, says the Ritual, is \"to see if t he Chapter is hermetically sealed; whether the materials ar e ready, and the el ements; whether the Black gives place to the Whit e, and the White to the Red.\" \"Be laborious,\" it says, \"lik e the Star, and procure the light of the Sages, and hide yourself from the Stupid Profane and the Ambitious, and be li ke the Owl, which sees only by night, and hides itse lf from treacherous curiosity.\" \"The Sun, on entering each of his houses, should be re ceived there by the four elements, which you must be careful to invi te to accompany you, that they may aid you in your undertaking; for without them the Hous e would be melancholy: wherefore you will gi ve him to feast upon the four elements."},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"\"When he shall have visited his twelve houses, and s een you attentive there to receive him, you will be come one of his chiefest favorites, and he will allow you to share all his gifts.

By its power they would succeed in discovering the primary metal of the Sun, which holds within itself the Principl e of the germ, and wherewith we can put in alliance and si x other metals, each of whic h contains the principles and primitive seed of t he grand philosophical work. \"The six other metals are Satu rn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Me rcury, and Luna; vulgarly known as Lead, Tin, Iron, Copper, Quicksilver, and Silv er.

Th e triangle contains in its si des the numbers 1, 2, and 3. The Perpendicular is the Ma le; the Base, the Female; t he Hypothenuse, the product of the two. To fix the volatile, in the Hermetic lan guage, means to materi alize the spirit; to volatilize the fixed is to spiritualize matter. To separate the subtile from the gross, in t he first operation, which is wholly internal, is to free our soul from all prej udice and all vice. This is effected by the use of the philosophical SALT, that is to say, of WISDOM; of MERCURY, that is to say, of personal aptitude and labo r; and of SULPHUR, which re presents the vital energy, and the ardor of the will. Thus we succeed in changing into spiritual gold such things even as are of l east value, and even the foul things of the earth. It is in this sense we ar e to understand the par ables of the Herm etic philosophers and the prophets of Alchemy; but in their works, as in the Great Work, we must skillfully separate the subtile from the gross, the mystic from the positi ve, allegory from theory. If you would read them with pleasure an d understandingly, you must first understand them a llegorically in their entirety and then descend fr om allegories to realities by way of th e correspondences or analogies indicated in the single dogma: \"What is above is like what is below; and what is below is li ke what is above.\" The treatise \"Minerva Mundi, \" attributed to Hermes Tr ismegistus, contains, under the most poetical a nd profound alle gories, the dogma of the self-creation of beings, or of the law of creat ion that results from the accord of two fo rces, these which the Alchemists called the Fixed and the Vola tile, and which are, in the Absolute, Necessity and Liberty. When the Masters in Al chemy say that it needs but little time and expense to accomplish the works of Sc ience, when they affirm, abov e all, that but a single vessel is necessary, when they speak of th e Great and Single furnace, which all can use, which is within th e reach of all the world, and which men possess without knowing it, they allude to the philosophical and moral Alchemy. In fact, a strong and determined will can, in a little while, at tain complete indepe ndence; and we all possess that chemical instru ment, the great and single at hanor or furnace, which serves to separate the subtil e from the gross, and the fi xed from the volatile. This instrument, complete as the world, and accu rate as the mathematics themselves, is designated by the Sages under the emblem of the Pentag ram or Star with five points, the absolute sign of human intelligence. The end and perfection of the Great Work is expressed, in alchemy, by a triangle surmounted by a cross: and the letter Tau, the last of the Sacred alphabet, has the"},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"same meaning. The \"elementary fire,\" that co mes primarily by attraction, is evidently Electricity or the Electric Force, primaril y developed as magnetism, and in which is perhaps the secret of life or the vital force. Paracelsus, the great Reformer in m edicine, discovered magnetism long before Mesmer, and pushed to its last consequences this lumi nous discovery, or rather this initiation into the m agic of the ancients, who un derstood the gr and magical agent better than we do, and did not r egard the Astral Light, Azoth, the universal magnetism of the Sages, as an animal and particular fluid, emanating only from certain special beings. The four Elements, the four symbolic ani mals, and the re-dupl icated Principles correspond with each othe r, and are thus arranged by the Hermetic Masons; The Air and Earth repr esent the Male Principle; and the Fire and Wa ter belong to the Female Principle. To these four forms co rrespond the four follow ing philosophical ideas. Spirit: Matter: Mo vement: Repose. Alchemy reduces these four things to three: The Absolute: the Fixed: the Volatile. Reason: Necessity; Liberty: are th e synonyms of these three words. A s all the great Mysteries of God and the Universe are thus hidden in the Ternary, it everywhere appears in Mas onry and in the Herm etic Philosophy under its mask of Alchemy. It even appear s where Masons do not suspect it; to teac h the doctrine of the equilibrium of Contraries , and the result ant Harmony. The double triangle of Solomon is explained by Sain t John in a remarkable manner: There are, he says, three witnesses in Heav en,--the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and three witnesses on earth, the breath, water, and blood. He thus agrees with the Masters of the Hermeti c Philosophy, who give to their Sulphur the name of Ether, to their Mercury the name of philosophical water, to their Sa lt that of blood of the dragon, or mens truum of the earth. The blood, or Salt, corresponds by opposition with the Fath er; the Azothic, or Mercurial water, with the Word, or Logos; and the breath, with the Holy Spirit. But the things of High Symbolism can be well understood only by the tr ue children of Science. Alchemy has its Symbolic Tr iad of Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury,--man consisting, according to the Hermetic ph ilosophers, of Body, Soul, and Spirit. The Dove, the Raven, and the Phoenix are st riking Symbols of Good a nd Evil, Light and Darkness,"},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"and the Beauty resulting from the equilibrium of the two. If you would unde rstand the true secrets of Alchemy, you must study the works of the Masters with patience and assiduity. Ev ery word is often an enigma; and to him who reads in haste, the whol e will seem absurd . Even when they seem to teach that the Great Work is the pu rification of the Soul, and so to deal only with morals, they most conceal their meaning, and deceive all bu t the Initiates. Yod is termed in the Kabal ah the opifex, workm an of the Deity. It is, says the Porta Coelorum, single and primal, like one, which is the first among num bers; and like a point, the first before all bodi es. Moved lengthwise, it prod uces a line, which is Vau, and this moved sidewise produces a supe rficies, which is Daleth. Thus Vau becomes Daleth; for movement tends from right to left; and all communication is from above to below. The plenitude of Yod, that is, the name of this letter, spelled, is Y-O-D. Vau [which represents 6] and Daleth [4] are 10; like Yod, their principle. Yod, says the Siphra de Ze niutha, is the Symbol of Wisdom and of the Father. The Principle called Father, says the Idra Su ta, is comprehend ed in Yod, which flows downward from the Holy influence, wherefor e Yod is the most occult of all the letters; for he is the begi nning and end of all things. Th e Supernal Wisdom is Yod; and all things are included in Yod, who is therefore called Father of Fa thers,or the Generator of the Universal. The Principle of all things is called the House of all things: wherefore Yod is the beginning and end of all things; as it is written: \"Thou hast made all things in Wisdom .\" For The All is termed Wisdom; and in it The All is contained; and the summary of all thi ngs is the Holy Name. Yod, says the Siphra de Ze niutha, signifying the Father , approaches the letter He, which is the Mother; and by the combination of these tw o is denoted that luminous infiuence wherewith Binah is im bued by the Supernal Wisdom. In the name, says the same , are included the Father, Mother and Microprosopos, their issue. He, impregnated by Vau, produced Micropro sopos, or Seir Anpin. Wisdom, Hakemah, is the Principl e of all things: it is the Fa ther of Father s, and in it are the beginning and end of all things. Micr oprosopos, the second Universal, is the issue of Wisdom, the Father , and Binah, the Mother, and is composed of the six Numerations, Geburah, Gedulah, and Tephar eth, Netsach Hod, and Yesod; is represented under the form of a man, and said to have at first occupied the place afterward filled by the world Briah [of Creation], but afterward to have been raised to the Aziluthic sphere, and rece ived Wisdom, Intelligence, a nd Cognition [D aath] from the Supernal Wisdom and Intellectuality. Vau, in the tri-liter al word, denotes these six memb ers of Microprosopos. For this latter is formed after the fashion of Ma croprosopos, but withou t Kether, the will, which remains in the first pr ototype or Universal; though invested with a portion of the Divine Intellectual Power and Capacity. The first Univ ersal does not use the first person, and is called in th e third person, HUA, HE: but the second Universal speaks in the first person, us ing the word ANI, I."},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"The IDRA RABBA, or Sy nodus Magna, one of the books of the Sohar, says: The Eldest of the Eldest [the Absolute Deity] is in Micropr osopos. All thin gs are one: all was, all is, all will be: there neither will be, no r is, nor has been, mutation. But He confirmed Himself, by the formings, into a form that contains all forms. in a form which comprehends all genera. This form is in the likeness of His form; and is not that form but its analogue: wherefore t he human form is the form of all above and below, which are incl uded in it: and bec ause it embraces al l above and below. The Most Holy so took form, and so Micr oprosopos was configured. All things are equally one, in each of the two Universals; but in the second His ways are divided, and judgment is on our side, and on the si de that looks toward us, also, they differ. These Secrets are made known only to the reapers in the Holy Field. The Most Holy Ancient is not called ATHAU, T hou, but HUA, He: but in Microprosopos, where is t he beginning of things, He has the name ATHAH, and also AB, Father. From Him is the beginning, a nd He is called Thou, and is the Father of Fathers. He issues from the Non-Ens; and therefore is beyond cognition. Wisdom is the Principle of th e Universe, and from it thir ty-two ways diverge: and in them the law is contained, in twenty-two letters and ten words. Wisdom is the Father of Fathers, and in this Wisdom is found t he Beginning and the End: wherefore there is a wis dom in each Universal, o ne above, the other below. The Commentary of Rabbi Chaj un Vital, on the Siphra de Zeniutha, says: At the beginning of emanati on, Microprosopos issued from the Father, and was intermingled with the Mother, under th e mysteries of t he letter [He], resolved that is, Daleth and Vau; by which Vau is denoted Microprosopos : because Vau is six, and he is constituted of the six parts that follow Hakemah and Binah. And, according to this conception, the Father is called Father of Father s, because from Him these Fathers proceed, Benignity, Severity, and Beauty. Microp rosopos was then like the letter Vau in the le tter He, because He had no h ead; but when He was now born, three brains were constitut ed for Him, by the flow of Divine Li ght from above. And as the world of restitution [after t he vessels of the Seph iroth below Binah had been broken, that from the fragments evil mi ght be created] is in stituted after the fashion of the Balance, so also is it formed througho ut in the human form. But Malakoth, Regnum, is a co mplete and separate person, behind Microprosopos, and in conjunction with him, a nd the two are called man. The first world [of Inanity] could not continue and did no t subsist, because it had no human conformation nor the system of the Balance, th e Sephiroth being points, one below the other. The first Adam [M icroprosopos, as distinguished from Macroprosopos, the first Occult Adam] was the b eginning, wherein the ten Numerations proceeded fort h from potence into act. Microprosopos is the second garment or interposed m edium, with respect to the Elder Most Holy, who is the name Tetr agrammaton; and he is called Alohim;"},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"because the former is Absolute Commiser ation; while in Macr oprosopos his lights have the nature of Seve rities, with respect to the el der Universal; though they are Commiseration, with respect to the lights of Ma lakoth and the th ree lower worlds. All the conformations of Macroprosopos come from the first Adam; who, to interpose a second covering, caused a singl e spark to issue fr om the sphere of Severity, of whose five letter s is generated the name Aloh im. With this issued from the brain a most subtle air, which takes its place on the right hand, wh ile the spark of fire is on the left . Thus the white and r ed do not intermi x, that is, the Air and Fire, which are Mercy and Judgment. Microprosopos is the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, his Severities being the Evil. REGNUM, to which is given the name of Word of The Lo rd, superinvests Heaven, as the six members of the Degree Tephareth ar e called, and thes e become and are constituted by that superior vestiture. For every conf ormation and co nstitution is effected by means of veil ing, because occultati on here is th e same as manifestation, the excess of light being veiled, so that, di minished in intensity and degree, it may be received by those below. Those six members conceived of as contained in Binah, are said to be in the World of Crea tion; as in Tephareth, in that of Formation; and as in Malakoth , in that of Fabrication. Before the institution of e quilibrium, face was not towa rd face: Microprosopos and his wife issuing fort h back to back, and yet coheri ng. So above; before the prior Adam was conformed into male and fe male, and the stat e of equilibrium established, the Father and Mother were not face to face. For the Father denotes the most perfect Love; and the Mother the most perf ect Rigor. And the seven supernal sons who proc eeded from her, from Binah, wh o brought forth seven, were all most perfect rigors, havi ng no connection with a root in the Most Holy Ancient; that is, they were all dead, destroyed, shattered; but they were plaeed in equilibrium, in the equipoise of the Occult Wi sdom, when it wa s conformed into male and female, Rigor and Love, and t hey were then rest ored, and there was given them a root above. The Father is Love and Me rcy, and with a pure and s ubtle Aur or Benignity impregnates the Mother, who is Rigor and Severity of Judgments; and the product is the brain of Microprosopos. It was determined, says the Intr oduction to the B ook Sohar, by the Deity, to create Good and Evil in the world, according to what is said in Isaiah, \"who makes the Light and creates the Evil.\" But the Evil was at first occult, an d could not be generated and brought fo rth, except by the sinning of the First Adam. Wherefore He determined that the num erations first emanated, from Benignity downward, should be destroyed and shattered by th e excessive influx of His Light; His intention being to create of them the worlds of Evils. But the first thr ee were to remain and subsist, that among the fragments s hould be neither Will, Inte llectual Power, nor the Capacity of Intellecti on of the Divinity. The last seven numerations were points, like the first three, each s ubsisting independently, unsusta ined by companionship;"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"which was the cause of their dying and being shattered. There was then no Love betw een them, but only a two- fold Fear; Wisdom, for example, fearing lest it shoul d ascend again to its Source in Kether; and also lest it should descend into Binah. Hence there wa s no union between any two, except Hakemah and Binah, a nd this imperfect, with averted faces. This is the meaning of the saying, that the world was created by Ju dgment, which is f ear. And so that world could not subsist, and the Seven King s were dethroned, until the attribute of Compassion was adjoined to it , and then restorat ion took place. Thence came Love and Union, and six of the part s were united into one person; for Love is the attribute of Compassion or Mercy. Binah produced the Seven Kings , not successively, but all toget her. The Seventh is Regnum, called a stone, the co rner-stone, because on it are builded the palaces of the three lower worlds. The first six were shattered into fr agments; but Regnum wa s crushed into a formless mass, lest the mali gnant demons created from the fragments of the others should receive bodies from it, since from it came bod ies and vitali ty [Nephesch]. From the fragments of the ve ssels came all Evils; j udgments, turbid waters, impurities, the Serpen t, and Adam Belial [Baal]. But t heir internal li ght re-ascended to Binah, and then fl owed down again into the worlds Briah and Yezirah, there to form vestiges of the Seven Numerations. The Sparks of the great Influence of the shattered vases descending into the four spiritual elemen ts, Fire, Air, Water, and Earth, and thence into th e inanimate, vegetabl e, living, and sp eaking kingdoms, became Souls. Selecting the suitable from the unsuitable lights, and separating the good from the evil, the Deity first restored the universality of the Seven Kings of the World Aziluth, and afterward the th ree other Worlds. And though in them were both good and evil, still this evil di d not develop itself in act, since the Severities remained, thoug h mitigated; so me portion of them being necessary to prevent the fr agments of the in teguments from asce nding. These were also left, because connection of two is necessary to g eneration. And this necessity for the existence of Severity is the m ystery of the pleasure and warmth of the generative appetite; a nd thence Love between husband and wife. If the Deity, says the Intr oduction, had not created worlds and then destroyed them, there could have been no evil in the worl d, but all things must have been good. There would have been neither reward nor punishment in the world. There would have been no merit in righteousness, for th e Good is known by the evil, nor would there have been fruitfulness or multiplication in th e world. If all carnal concupiscence were enchained for three da ys in the mouth of the great abyss, the egg of one of the days wo uld be wanting to the sick man. In time to come it will be called Laban, because it will be whitened of its impurity, and will return to the realm Israel, and they wi ll pray the Lord to give them the app etite of carnal concupiscence, for the begetting of children."},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"The intention of God was, when He creat ed the world, that Hi s creatures should recognize His existence. Ther efore He created evils, to afiqict them withal when they should sin, and Light and Blessing to reward the just . And therefore man necessarily has free-will and election, since Good and Evil are in the World. And these kings died, says the Commentar y, because the condi tion of equilibrium did not yet exist, nor was Adam Kadmon formed ma le and female. Th ey were not in contact with what was aliv e: nor had any root in Adam Kadmon ; nor was Wisdom which outflowed from Him, th eir root, nor did they connect with it. For all these were pure mercies and most simple Love; but those were ri gorous judgments. Whence face looked not toward face ; nor the Father toward t he Mother, because from her proceeded judgments. Nor Macroprosopos toward Mi croprosopos. And Regnum, the last numeration, was empt y and inane. It has nothing of itself; and, as it were, was nothing, receiving nothing from them. Its need was, to receive Love from the Male; for it is mere rigo r and judgment ; and the Love and Rigor must temper each other, to produce creation, and its multitudes above and below. For it was made to be inhabited; and when rigorous judgments rule in it, it is inane because its processes cannot be carried on. Wherefore the Balance must needs be instituted, that t here might be a root above, so that judgments might be restored and tempered, and live and not again die. And Seven Conformations descend; and all things becom e in equilibrium, and the needle of the Balance is the root above. In the world Yezirah, says the Pneumatica K abalistica, denotes Kether; Hakemah and Binah; and Gedulah, Gebu rah, and Tephare th; and thus Vau is Beauty and Harmony. The Man is Hakemah; the Eagl e, Binah; the Lion, Gedulah; and the Ox, Geburah. And the mysterious circle is thus formed by the Sohar and all the Kabalists: Michael a nd the face of the Li on are on the South, and the right hand, with the letter Yod, and Water; Gabriel and the face of the Ox, on t he North, and left hand, with the first of the Te tragrammaton and Fire ; Uriel and the face of the Eagle, on the East and forward, with and Air; and Raph ael and the face of the Man, on the West, and backward with the last Earth. In the sa me order, the four letters represent the four worlds. Rabbi Schimeon Ben Joc hai says that th e four animals of the Mysterious Chariot, whose wheels are Netsach and Hod, ar e Gedulah, whose face is the Lion's; Geburah, with that of the Ox ; Tephareth, with that of the Eagle; and Malakoth, with that of the Man.

For the better understan ding of the Kabalah, remember that Kether, or the Crown, is treated of as a person, composed of the ten Numera tions, and as such termed Arik Anpin, or Macroprosopos: That Hakemah is a person, and termed Abba, or Father: That Binah is a person, and termed Mother, Imma: That Tephareth, including all the Numerations from Khased or Gedulah to Yesod, is a person, called Seir Anpi n, or Microprosopos. Thes e Numerations are six in number, and are represent ed by the interlaced triangle, or the Seal of Solomon. A nd Malakoth is a person, an d called the wife of Microp rosopos. Vau represents the Beauty or Harmony, consis ting of the six par ts which constitu te Seir Anpin. The wife, Malakoth, is said to be behind the husband, Seir, and to have no other cognition of him. And this is thus explained: That every cognizable object is to be known in two ways: a priori, wh ich is when it is known by means of its cause, or of itself; or, a posteriori when it is known by its effects. T he most nearly perfect mode of cognition is, when the intellect knows the thing itse lf, in itself, and through itself. But if it knows the thingby its similitude or i dea, or species separate from it, or by its effects and operations, the c ognition is much feebler and more imperfect. And it is thus only that Regnum, the wife of Se ir, knows her husband, unt il face is turned to face, when they unite, and s he has the more nearly perf ect knowledge. For then the Deity, as limited and manifested in Seir an d the Universe are one. Vau is Tephareth, considered as the Unity in which are the six members, of which itself is one. Tephareth, Beau ty, is the column which supp orts the world, symbolized by the colum of the junior Warden in the Blue Lodges.

Andrew, 30º - Knight Kadosh 31º - Inspector Inquist or, 32º - Master of the Royal Secret XXIX. GRAND SCOTTISH KNIGHT OF ST. ANDREW. A MIRACULOUS tradition, so mething like that connecte d with the labarum of Constantine, hallows the Ancient Cross of St. Andrew. Hungus , who in the ninth century reigned over the Picts in Scotland, is said to hav e seen in a vision, on the night before a battle, the Apostle Saint Andr ew, who promised hi m the victory; and for an assured token thereof, he told him that t here should appear over the Pictish host, in the air, such a fashioned cross as he had suffered upon. Hungus, awakened, looking up at the s ky, saw the promised cross, as did all of both armies; and Hungus and the Picts, after rendering t hanks to the Apostle for their victory, and making their offeri ngs with humble devot ion, vowed that from thenceforth, as well they as their post erity, in time of war, would wear a cross of St. Andrew for their badge and cognizance. John Leslie, Bishop of Ross, says that this cross appeare d to Achaius, King of the Scots, and Hungus, King of the Picts, the night before the battle was fought betwixt them and Athelstane, King of England, as they were on thei r knees at prayer. Every cross of Knighthood is a symbol of the nine qualit ies of a Knight of St. Andrew of Scotland; for ever y order of chivalry required of its vo taries the same virtues and the sa me excellencies. Humility, Patience, and Self-deni al are the three essential qu alities of a Knight of St. Andrew of Scotland. The Cro ss, sancti fied by the blood of the holy ones who have died upon it; the Cross, whic h Jesus of Nazareth bore, fa inting, along t he streets of Jerusalem and up to Calvary, upon which He cried, \"Not My will, O Father! but Thine be done,\" is an unmista kable and eloquent symbol of these three virtues. He suffered upon it, because He consorted wi th and taught the p oor and lowly, and found His disciples among the fishermen of Galil ee and the despised publicans. His life was one of Hu mility, Patience, and Self-denial. The Hospitallers and Templa rs took upon themselves vo ws oi obedience, poverty, and chastity. The Lamb, which became the de vice of the Seal of the Order of the Poor Fellow Soldiery oi th e Temple of Solomon, conv eyed the same lessons of humility and self-denial as the original device of two Knights ridi ng a single horse. The Grand Commander warned every candidate not to be induced to enter the Order by a vain hope of enj oying earthly pomp and splendor . He told hi m that he"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"would have to endure many things, sorely against his inclin ations; and that he would be compelled to give up his own will, and submit entirely to that of his superiors. The religious Houses of th e Hospitallers, despoiled by Henry the Eighth's worthy daughter, Elizabeth, because they would not take t he oath to maintain her supremacy, had been Alms -houses, and Dispensaries , and Foundling-asyla, relieving the State of many orphan and outcast children , and ministering to their necessities, God's ravens in the wilderne ss, bread and flesh in the morning, bread and flesh in the evening. Th ey had been Inns to the wa yfaring man, who heard from afar the sound of the Vesper bell, inviting him to repose and devotion at once, and who might sing his matins wit h the Morning Star, and go on his way rejoicing. And the Knights were no less dist inguished by bravery in battl e, than by tenderness and zeal in their ministrati ons to the sick and dying. The Knights of St. Andrew vowed to defend all orphans, maidens, and widows of good family, and wherever they heard of murderers, r obbers, or masterful thieves who oppressed the people, to bring them to the laws, to the best of their power. \"If fortune fail you,\" so ran the vows of Rouge-Croix, \"in divers lands or countries wherever you go or ride that you find any gentleman of name and arms, which hath lost goods, in worship and Knighthood, in the King's service, or in any other place of worship, and is fallen into poverty, you shall aid, and support, and succ or him, in that you may; and he ask of you your goods to his sust enance, you shall give him part of such goods as G od hath sent you to your power, and as you may bear.\" Thus CHARITY and GE NEROSITY are even mo re essential qualit ies of a true and gentle Knight, and have been so in all ages; and so also hath CLEMENCY. It is a mark of a noble nature to sp are the conquered. Valor is th en best tempered, when it can turn out a stern fo rtitude into the mild strains of pity, whic h never shines more brightly than when she is clad in steel. A martial man, compassi onate, shall conquer both in peace and war; and by a twofold way, get victory with h onor. The most famed men in the wo rld have had in them both c ourage and compa ssion. An enemy reconciled hath a greater value than the long train of captives of a Roman triumph. VIRTUE, TRUTH, and HONOR are the three MOST essential qualities of a Knight of St. Andrew. \"Ye shall love God above all things, and be steadfast in the Faith,\" it was said to the Knights, in their charge, \"and ye shall be true unto your Sovereign Lord, and true to your word and promise. Also, ye shall sit in no place where that any judgment should be given wrongfully against any body, to your knowledge.\" The law hath not power to strike the vi rtuous, nor can fort une subvert the wise. Virtue and Wisdom, only, perfect and defend man. Virtue's garment is a sanctuary so sacred, that even Pr inces dare not strike the man that is t hus robed. It is the livery of the King of Heaven. It protects us when we ar e unarmed; and is an armor that we cannot lose, unless we be false to ourselves. It is the tenure by which we hold of Heaven, without whic h we are but outlaws , that cannot clai m protection. Nor is there wisdom without vi rtue, but only a cunning way of procuring our own undoing. "},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"Peace is nigh Where Wisdom's voice ha s found a listening heart.

Even our swords are fo rmed to remind us of the Cross, and you and any other of us may live to show how much men bear and do not die; for this world is a place of sorrow and tears, of great evils and a c onstant calamity, and if we would win true honor in it, we must permit no virtue of a Knight to be come unfamiliar to us, as men's friends, coldly entreated and not greatly valued, become mere ordinary acquaintances.

Honor ant iquity and great d eeds, and detract nothing from the dignity and li berty of any one.

Therefore do yo u here, and for all time to come, lay aside all uncharitable and r epining feeling; be proof henceforwa rd against the suggestions of undiscipline d passion and inhuman zeal; lear n to hate the vices and not the vicious; be content wit h the discharge of the duti es which your Masonic and Knightly professions require; be gover ned by the old prin ciples of honor and chivalry, and reverence with constancy that Truth which is as sacred and immutable as God Himself. And above all, remember always, that je alousy is not our life, nor disputation our end, nor disunion our health, nor reve nge our happiness; but loving- kindness is all these, grea ter than Hope, great er than Faith, which can remove mountains, properly the only thing which God requires of us, and in the possession of which lies the fulfil lment of all our duties.

The Steam-Engine is the pre-eminent god of the nineteenth century, whos e idolaters are everywhere, and those, who wi eld its tremendous power secure ly account themselves gods, everywhere in the civilized world. Others confess it everywhere, and we must confess here , how reluctantly soever, that the age which we represent is narrowe d and not enlarged by its discoveries, and has lost a larger world than it has gained. If we cannot go as far as the satirist who says that our self-adored century - its broad clown's back turns broadl y on the glory of the stars, we can go with hi m when he adds, We are gods by ou r own reckoning, and may as well shut up our temples And wield on amidst the incense- steam, the thunder of our cars: For we throw out acclamations of self-thanking, self-admiring With, at every step, \"Run faster, O the wondrous, wondrous age!\" Little heeding if our souls are wrought as nobly as our iron, Or if angels will commend us at the goal of pilgrimage.

Destruction was denou nced by the Prophe ts against Tyre and Sidon, Babylon, and Damascu s, and Jerusalem, as a consequence of the sins of their people; but if fire now consumes or earthquake shatters or the tornado crushes a great city, those ar e scoffed at as fanatics and sneered at for indulging in cant, or rebuked fo r Pharisaic uncharit ableness, who venture to believe and say that there are divine retributions and Go d's judgment in the ruin wrought by His mighty agencies. Science, wanderi ng in error, struggles to remove God's Provi dence to a distance from us and the mate rial Universe, and to substitute for its supervision and care and constant overseeing, what it calls Forces-- Forces of Na ture--Forces of Matter. It will not see that the Forces of Nature are th e varied actions of God. Hence it becomes antagonistic to all Religion, and to al l the old Faith that has from the beginning illuminated human soul s and constituted their c onsciousness of their own dignity, their divine or igin, and their immort ality; that Faith wh ich is the Light by which the human soul is enabled, as it we re, to see itself. It is not one religion only, but the basis of all religions, the Tr uth that is in all religions, even the religious creed of Masonry, that is in danger. For all religions have owed all of life that they have had, and their very being, to t he foundation on which they were reared; the proposition, deemed undeniable and an axiom, that the Providence of God rule s directly in all the affairs and changes of material things. The Science of the age has it s hands upon the pill ars of the Temple , and rocks it to its foundation. As yet its de structive efforts have but torn from the anci ent structure the worm-eaten fret-work of superstiti on, and shaken down some incoherent additions--owl-inhabited turr ets of ignorance, and massi ve props that supported nothing. The structure itself will be overthrown, w hen, in the vivi d language of a living writer, \"Human reason le aps into the throne of Go d and waves her torch over the ruins of the Universe.\" Science deals only with phenom ena, and is but charlatanism when it babbles about the powers or causes that produce these, or what the th ings are, in essence, of which it gives us merely the names. It no more know s what Light or Sound or Perfume is, than the Aryan ca ttle-herders did, when t hey counted the Dawn and Fire, Flame and Light and Heat as gods. And that Athe istic Science is not even half- science, which ascribes the Universe and its powers and forces to a system of natural laws or to an inhere nt energy of Nature, or to causes unknown, existing and operating independently of a Divine and Su pra-natural power. That theory would be greatly fortified, if science we re always capable of protecting life and property, and, with anything like the cert ainty of which it boasts, securing human interests even against th e destructive agencies that man himself develops in his endeavors to subserve th em. Fire, the fourth elemen t, as the old philosophers deemed it, is his most useful and abject servant. Why cann ot man prevent his ever breaking that ancient inde nture, old as Prom etheus, old as A dam? Why can he not be certain that at any moment his terrible subject may not break forth and tower up into his master, tyrant, destroyer? It is bec ause it also is a pow er of nature; which, in ultimate trial of forces, is always superior to man. It is also becau se, in a different sense from that in which it is the servant of man, it is the servant of Him Who makes His ministers a flame of fire, and Who is over natur e, as nature is over man.

In other matters relative to human safety and intere sts we have observed how confident science become s upon the strength of some slight su ccess in the war of man with nature, and how much inclined to put itself in the place of Providence, which, by the very force of the ter;n, is the only absolute sc ience. Near the beginning of this century, for instance, medical and sanitary science had made, in the course of a few years, great and wonderful progre ss. The great plague which wasted Europe in the four teenth and fifteenth centur ies, and reapp eared in the seventeenth, had been identified with a disease which yi elds to enlightened treatment, and its anci ent virulence was at tributed to ignorance of hygiene, and the filthy habits of a former age. Another fatal and disfi guring scourge had to a great extent been checked by the discovery of vaccination. Fr om Sangrado to Sydenham, from Paracelsus to Jenner , the healing art had indeed taken a long stride. The Faculty might be excused had it then said, \"Man is mort al, disease will be often fatal; but there shall be no more unresisted and unnecessary slaughter by infectious disease, no more gene ral carnage, no more carnivals of terror and high festivals of death.\" The conceited boast would hardly have died upon the lip, when, from the mysterious depths of remote st India a spectre stalked fo rth, or rather a monster crept, more fearful than hu man eye had ever yet beheld. A nd not with surer instinct does the tiger of the jungles, where this terrible pestilence was bor n, catch the scent of blood upon the air, than did this invisible De stroyer, this fearful agent of A lmighty Power, this treme ndous Consequence of some Su fficient Cause, scent the tainted atmosphere of Euro pe and turn Westward his devastating march. The millions of dead left in his path through As ia proved nothing. They were unarmed, ignorant, defenceless, unaided by science, undefended by art. T he cholera was to them inscrutable and ir resistible as Azrael , the Angel of Death. But it came to Europe and swept the halls of science as it had swept the Indian village and the Persian khan. It leaped as noise lessly and descended as destructively upon the populat ion of many a high-towered, wide-paved, purified, and disinfected city of the West as upon the Pariahs of Tanjore and the filthy streets of Stamboul.

Therefore shall ev il come upon thee; thou shalt no t know whence it riseth; and mischief s hall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it off; desolation shall come upon thee suddenly.\" And as to London--it looked like judgment, if it be true that the Asiatic cholera had its origin in English avaric e and cruelty, as they suppos e who trace it to the tax which Warren Hastings , when Governor-General of India, imposed on salt, thus cutting off its use from milli ons of the vegetable-eating race s of the East: just as that disease whose spectral shadow lies always upon America's threshol d, originated in the avarice and cruelty of the slave-trade, translating the African coast fever to the congenial climate of the West Indies and Souther n America--the yell ow fever of the former, and the vomito negro of the latter. But we should be slow to make inferences from our petty human logic to the ethics of the Almighty. Whatever th e cruelty of the slave-trade, or the severity of slavery on the continents or is lands of America, we should still, in re gard to its supposed consequences, be wiser, perhaps , to say with that great and simple Casuist Who gave the world the Christi an religion: \"Suppos e ye that these Galileans were sinners above all the Galile ans because they suffered such things ? or those eighteen upon whom the tower of Siloam fell and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all the men th at dwelt in Jerusalem?\" Retribution bars retaliation, even in words. A city sh attered, burned, destroyed, desolate, a land wasted, hum iliated, made a desert and a wilderness, or wearing the thorny crown of humili ation and subjugation, is invested with the sacred prerogatives and immunities of the dead.

The best friends of Masonry in Amer ica were the Anti -Masons of 1826, and at the same time t hey were its worst enem ies. Men are but the automata of Providence, and it uses the demagogue, th e fanatic, and the knave, a common trinity in Republics, as its tools a nd instruments to effect that of which they do not dream, and which t hey imagine themselves commissioned to prevent. The Anti-Masons, traitors and perj urors some, and some mere political knaves, purified Masonry by persecu tion, and so pr oved to be its benefactors; for that whic h is persecuted, grows. To them its present popularity is due, the cheapening of its Degrees, the invasion of its Lodges, that are no longer Sanctuaries, by t he multitude; its pomp and pageantry and over done display. An hundred years ago it had become known that the were the Templars under a veil, and therefor e the Degree was proscribed, and, ceasing to be worked, became a mere brief a nd formal ceremony, under another name. Now, from the tomb in which afte r his murders he rotted, Clement the Fifth howls against the successors of his victims, in the Allocution of Pio Nono against the Fr ee-Masons. The ghos ts of the dead Templars haunt the Vatican and di sturb the slumbers of the paralyzed Papacy, which, dreading the dead, shrieks out its excomm unications and impotent anathemas against the living. It is a de claration of war, and was needed to arouse apathy and i nertness to action. An enemy of the Templars shall tell us th e secret of this Papal hostility against an Order that has existed for centuries in despite of its anathemas, "},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"and has its Sanctuaries and Asyla even in Rome. It will be easy, as we read, to s eparate the false fr om the true, the audacious conjectures from the simple facts. \"A power that ruled wit hout antagonism and wi thout concurrence, and consequently without contro l, proved fatal to the Sacerdotal Royalties; while the Republics, on the other hand, had perished by t he conflict of liberties and franchi ses, which, in the absence of all duty hierarchically sanctioned and enforced, had soon become mere ty rannies, rivals one of the other. To find a st able medium between these tw o abysses, the idea of the Christian Hierophants was to create a society devoted to abnegation by solemn vows, protec ted by severe regulati ons; which should be recruited by initiation, a nd which, sole depositary of the great religious and social secrets, should make Kings and Po ntiffs, without expo sing it to the corruptions of Power. In that was the secret of that kingdo m of Jesus Christ, which, without being of this world, would govern all its grandeurs. \"This idea presided at the foundation of the great religiou s orders, so often at war with the secular auth orities, ecclesiastical or civil. Its realization was also the dream of the dissident sects of Gnos tics or Illuminati who pretended to connect thei r faith with th e primitive tradition of the Christianity of Saint John. It at le ngth became a menace for the Church and Society, when a ri ch and dissolute Order, init iated in the mysterious doctrines of the Kabalah, seemed disposed to tu rn against legitimate authority the conservative principle of Hierarchy, and threatened the entire world with an immense revolution. The Templars, whose history is so im perfectly known, were those terrible conspirators. In 1118, nine Knights Crusaders in the East, among whom were Geoffroi de Saint-Omer an d Hugues de Payens, consecrated themselves to religion, and took an oath between the hands of the Patriarch of Constantinople , a See always secretly or openly hostile to that of Rome from the time of Photius. The avowed obje ct of the Templars was to protect the Christians who came to visit the Holy Places: their secret object was the re-building of the Temple of Solomon on the mo del prophesied by Ezekiel. \"This re-building, formally predicted by the Judaizing Mystics of the earlier ages, had become the secret dream of the Patriarchs of the Orient. The Temple of Solomon, re- built and consecrated to the Catholic worship would become, in effect, the Metropolis of the Un iverse; the East would prevail over the West, and the Patria rchs of Constant inople would possess themselves of t he Papal power. \"The Templars, or Poor Fe llow-Soldiery of the Holy House of the Temple intended to be re-built, took as t heir models, in the Bible, the Warrior- Masons of Zorobabel, wh o worked, holding the sw ord in one hand and the trowel in the other. Ther efore it was that the Sw ord and the Trowel were the insignia of the Templars, who subsequently, as will be seen, concealed themselves under the name of Brethren Masons. [This name, Frères Maçons in the Fr ench, adopted by way of secret reference to the Builders of the Second Temple, was corrupted in English into Free- Masons, as Pythagore de Crotone was into Peter Gower of Groton in England. Khairüm or Khür-üm, (a name mis-render ed into Hiram) from an "},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"artificer in brass and othe r metals, became the Chief Builder of the Haikal Kadosh, the Holy Hous e, of the Temple, the ; and the words Bonai and Banaim yet a ppear in the Masonic Degrees, meaning Builder and Builders.] \"The trowel of the Templars is quadruple, and the triangular pl ates of it are arranged in the form of a cross, making the Kabalistic pan tacle known by the name of the Cross of the East. The Knight of the East, and the Knight of the East and West, have in their titles secret al lusions to the Templars of whom they were at first the successors. \"The secret thought of Hugues de Payens, in fo unding his Order, was not exactly to serve the ambi tion of the Patriarchs of Constantinople. There existed at that period in the East a Sect of J ohannite Christians, who claimed to be the only true In itiates into the real myst eries of the religion of the Saviour. They pretended to know the real histor y of Yesus the ANOINTED, and, adopting in part the Jewish traditions and the tales of the Talmud, they held that the facts recounted in the Evangels are but allegories, the key of which Saint John gives, in saying that the world might be filled with the books that could be written upon the words and deeds of Jesus Christ ; words which, they t hought, would be only a ridiculous exaggeration, if he were not speaking of an allegory and a legend, that might be vari ed and prolonged to infinity. \"The Johannites ascribed to Saint John t he foundation of their Secret Church, and the Grand Pontiffs of the Sect assumed the title of Christos, Anointed, or Consecrat ed, and claimed to ha ve succeeded one another from Saint John by an uninterrupted succession of pontifical powers. He who, at the period of th e foundation of the Order of the Temple, claimed these imaginary prerogatives, wa s named THEOCLET; he knew HUGUES DE PAYENS, he initiat ed him into t he Mysteries a nd hopes of his pretended church, he seduced him by th e notions of Sove reign Priesthood and Supreme royalty, and finally de signated him as his successor \"Thus the Order of Knights of the Temple was at its very origin devoted to the cause of opposition to the tiara of Ro me and the crowns of Kings, and the Apostolate of Kabalistic Gnostici sm was vested in it s chiefs. For Saint John himself was the Father of the Gnostics, and the current translation of his polemic against the he retical of his Sect and the pagans who denied that Christ was the Word, is th roughout a misrepr esentation, or misunderstanding at leas t, of the whole Spirit of that Evangel. \"The tendencies and tene ts of the Order were enveloped in profound mystery, and it external ly professed the most perfect orthodoxy. The Chiefs alone knew the ai m of the Order: the Suba lterns followed them without distrust. \"To acquire influence and wealth, then to intrigue , and at need to fight, to establish the Johannit e or Gnostic and Kabalistic dogma, were the object and means proposed to the initiated Br ethren. The Papa cy and the rival monarchies, they said to them, are sold and bought in these days, become corrupt, and to-mo rrow, perhaps, will destr oy each other. All that will become the heritage of the Temple: the World will soon come to us for its Sovereigns and Pontiffs. We shal l constitute the equilibrium of the Universe, and be rulers over the Masters of the World. \"The Templars, like all other Secret Orders and Associ ations had two "},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"doctrines, one conceale d and reserved for the Master s, which was Johannism; the other public, which wa s the Roman Catholic. Thus they deceived the adversaries whom they sought to supplant. Hence Free-Masonry, vu lgarly imagined to have begun with the Dionysian Architects or the Ge rman Stone-workers, adopted Saint John the Evangelist as one of its patrons, associat ing with him, in order not to arouse the suspic ions of Rome, Saint John the Baptist, and thus covertly proclaiming itself the child of the Kabalah and Essenism together.\" [For the Johannism of the Adepts was the Kabalah of the earlier Gnostics, degenerating afterwar d into those heretical forms which Gnosticism developed, so that even Manes had his followers among them. Many adopted his doctrines of t he two Principles, the reco llection of which is perpetuated by the h andle of the dagger and the tesselat ed pavement or floor of the L odge, stupidly called \" the I ndented Tessel,\" an d represented by great hanging tassels, when it really means a tesserated floor (from the Latin tessera) of white an d black lozenges, with a necessarily denticulated or indented border or edging. And wherever, in the higher Degrees, the two colors white and bla ck, are in juxtaposition, the two Principles of Zoroaster and Manes are alluded to. With others the doctrine became a mystic Pantheism, de scended from that of the Brahmins, and even pushed to an idolatry of Nature and hatred of every revealed dogma. [To all this the absurd re ading of the established Church, taking literally the figurative, allegor ical, and mythical language of a collection of Oriental books of different ages, di rectly and inevitably led. The same result long after followed the folly of regarding the Hebrew book s as if they had been written by the unimaginati ve, hard, practical intell ect of the England of James the First and the bigoted stolid ity of Scottish Presbyterianism.] \"The better to succeed and win partisans, t he Templars sympathized with regrets for dethroned cr eeds and encourag ed the hopes of new worships, promising to all li berty of conscience and a new orthodoxy that should be the synthesis of all the persecuted creeds.\" [It is absurd to suppose that men of intellect adored a monstrous idol called Baphomet, or recognized Mahome t as an inspired prophet. Their symbolism, invented ages before, to conceal wh at it was dangerous to avow, was of course mis understood by thos e who were not adepts, and to their enemies seemed to be pantheistic. The calf of gold, made by Aaron for the Israelites, was but one of th e oxen under the laye r of bronze, and the Karobim on the Propit iatory, misunders tood. The symbols of the wise always become the idols of the ignorant multitude. What the Chiefs of the Order really believed and taught, is indi cated to the Adepts by the hints contained in the high Degrees of Free -Masonry, and by the sym bols which only the Adepts understand. [The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed t here to the Initiate, bu t he is intentionally misled by false interpretations.

Masonry is the veritable Sphinx, bu ried to the head in the sands heaped round it by the ages.] \"The seeds of decay were sown in the Order of t he Temple at its origin. Hypocrisy is a mortal disease. It had conceived a great wo rk which it was incapable of executing, bec ause it knew neither humility nor personal abnegation, because Rome was then invincible, and because the later Chiefs of the Order did not compreh end its mission. Moreover, the Templars were in gener al uneducated, and capable only of wielding the sword, with no qualifications for gov erning, and at need enchaining, that queen of the world called Opinion.\" [The doctrines of the Chiefs would, if expounded to the masses, have seemed to them t he babblings of folly. The symbols of the wise are the i dols of the vulgar, or else as meaningless as the hieroglyphics of Egypt to the nom adic Arabs. There must always be a common-place interpreta tion for the mass of Initiates, of the symbols that are eloq uent to the Adepts.] \"Hugues de Payens himself had not that keen and fa r-sighted intellect nor that grandeur of purpos e which afterwar d distinguished the military founder of another sold iery that became formi dable to kings.

Their projects were divined and prevented. [Rome, more intolerant of heresy th an of vice and crime, came to fear the Order , and fear is always cr uel. It has always deemed philosophical truth the mo st dangerous of heresies, and has never been at a loss for a false accusati on, by means of which to crush free thought.] Pope Clement V. a nd King Philip le Bel gave the signal to Eu rope, and the Templars, taken as it we re in an immense net, were arrested, disarmed, and cast into prison.

The Rose was for the Initiates th e living and blooming symbol of the revelation of the harmonies of being. It was the embl em of beauty, life, love, and pleasure. Flamel , or the Book of the Je w Abraham, made it the hieroglyphical sign of the accomplishment of the great Work. Such is the key of the Roman de la Ro se.

Religion, considered solely as a physiol ogical fact, is th e revelation and satisfaction of a necessity of souls. Its existence is a scientific fact; to deny it, would be to deny humanity itself. The Rose-Croix Adepts respected the dominant, hierarchical, and "},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"revealed religion. Consequently they co uld no more be th e enemies of the Papacy than of legitimate Monarchy; and if they conspired against the Popes and Kings, it was because they considered them personally as apostates from duty and supr eme favorers of anarchy.

One of the magnificen t pantacles that expr ess the esoteric and unutterable part of Science, is a Rose of Light, in the centre of which a human form extends its arms in the form of a cross. Commentaries and studies have been mu ltiplied upon th e Divine Comedy, the work of DANTE, and yet no one, so far as we know, has pointed out its especial character. The work of the gr eat Ghihellin is a declaration of war against the Papacy, by bold revelation s of the Mysteries. The Epic of Dante is Johannite and Gnostic, an audacious applic ation, like that of the Apocalypse, of the figu res and numbers of the Kabalah to the Christian dogmas, and a secret negat ion of every thing absol ute in these dogmas. His journey through the supernatural worlds is accomplished like the initiation into the Mysteries of Eleus is and Thebes. He escapes from that gulf of Hell over the gate of which the sentence of despair was written, by reversing the positions of his head and feet, that is to say, by accepting the direct opposite of the Catholic d ogma and then he reascends to the light, by using the Devil himself as a monstrous ladder. Faust ascends to Heaven, by stepping on t he head of the v anquished Mephistopheles. Hell is impassable for those only who know not how to turn back from it. We free ourselves from it s bondage by audacity. His Hell is but a negativ e Purgatory. His Heaven is composed of a series of Kabalistic circles, divide d by a cross, like the Pant acle of Ezekiel. In the centre of this cross blooms a rose an d we see the symbol of the Adepts of the Rose-Croix for the first ti me publicly expo unded and almost categorically explained. For the first time, becau se Guillaume de Lorris, w ho died in 1260, five years before the birth of Alighieri, had not completed his Roman de la Rose, which was cont inued by Chopinel, a half century afterward. One is astoni shed to discover that th e Roman de la Rose and the Divina Commedia are two opposite forms of one and the same work, initiation into independ ence of spirit, a satire on all contemporary institutions, and the allegorical formul a of the great Secr ets of the Society of the Roses-Croix. The important manife stations of Occultism coin cide with the period of the fall of the Templars; since Jean de M eung or Chopinel, contemporary of the old age of Dante, fl ourished during the best year s of his life at the Court of Philippe le Bel. The Roman de la Rose is the Epic of old France. It is a profound book , under the form of levity, a revelation as learned as that of Apuleius, of the M ysteries of Occultism. The Rose of Flam el, that of Jean de Meung, and that of Dante, grew on the same stem. Swedenborg's system was nothing el se than the Kabalah, minus the principle of the Hierarchy. It is t he Temple, without the keystone and the foundation. Cagliostro was the Agent of the Te mplars, and theref ore wrote to the Free-Masons of London that the time had come to begin the work of rebuilding the Temple of the Eter nal. He had introduced into Masonry a new "},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"Rite called the Eg yptian, and endeavored to re suscitate the mysterious worship of Isis. The three letters L\\ P\\D\\ on his s eal, were the initials of the words \"Lilia pedibus de strue;\" tread under foot the Lilies [of France], and a Masonic medal of the sixteenth or seventeenth ce ntury has upon it a sword cutting off the st alk of a lily, and the words \" talem dabit ultio messem,\" such harvest revenge will give. A Lodge inaugurated under the auspices of Rousseau, the fanatic of Geneva, became the centre of the revolutionary mo vement in France, and a Prince of the blood-roy al went thither to swea r the destruction of the successors of Philippe le Bel on th e tomb of Jacques de Molai. The registers of the Order of Templars attest that the Re gent, the Duc d' Orleans, was Grand Master of that formi dable Secret Societ y, and that his successors were the Duc de Maine, the Prince of Bourbon-Conde, and the Duc de Cosse-Brissac. The Templars compromitted the King; they saved him from the rage of the People, to exasperate that rage and brin g on the catastrophe prepared for centuries; it was a scaffold that the vengeance of the Templars demanded. The secret movers of the French Revolution had sworn to over turn the Throne and the Altar upon the Tomb of Jacques de Molai. Wh en Louis XVI. was executed, half the work was done; and thencefo rward the Army of the Temple was to direct all its efforts a gainst the Pope. Jacques de Molai and his companions were perhaps mart yrs, but their avengers dishonored their memory . Royalty was regenerated on the scaffold of Louis XVI., the Church triumphed in the captivity of Pius VI., carried a prisoner to Vale nce, and dying of fati gue and sorrow, but the successors of the Ancien t Knights of the Temple perished, overwhelmed in their fatal victory.  XXXI GRAND INSPECTOR IN QUISITOR COMMANDER. [Inspector Inquisitor.] To hear patiently, to weigh deliberately an d dispassionately, and to decide impartially;--these ar e the chief duties of a Judge. After the lessons you have rece ived, I need not further enlarge upon them. You wil l be ever eloquently remi nded of them by the furniture upon our Altar, and the decorations of the Tribunal. The Holy Bible will remind you of your obligation; and that as you judge here below, so you will be yourself judged hereafter, by One who has not to su bmit, like an earthly jud ge, to the sad necessity "},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"of inferring the motive s, intentions, and purp oses of men [of which all crime essentially consists] fr om the uncertain and often unsafe testimony of their acts and words; as men in thick darkness grope their way, with hands outstret ched before them: but before Whom every thought, feeling, impulse, and intentio n of every soul that now is, or ever was, or ever will be on earth , is, and ever will be through the whole infinite dura tion of eternity, present and visible. The Square and Compass, the Plumb and Level, are well known to you as a Mason. Upon you as a J udge, they peculia rly inculcate uprightness, impartiality, carefu l consideration of facts and circumstances, accuracy in judgment, and unifor mity in decision. As a Judge, too, you are to bring up square work and square work only. Like a temple erected by the plumb, you are to lean neither to one side nor the other. Li ke a building well s quared and levelled, you are to be firm and steadfast in your convictions of right and justice. Like the circle swept wi th the compasses, you are to be true. In the scales of justice yo u are to weigh the facts and the law alone, nor place in either scale personal friendship or personal dislike, neither fear nor fav our: and when reformation is no longer to be hoped fo r, you are to smite relentlessly with the sword of justice. The peculiar and principa l symbol of this Degr ee is the Tetractys of Pythagoras, suspende d in the East, where ordinarily the sacred word or letter glitters, like it , representing the Deity. Its nine external points form the triangle, the chief symbol in Masonry, with many of the meanings of which you are familiar. To us, its three sides represent the three pr incipal attributes of the Deity, which created, and now , as ever, support, uphold, and guide the Universe in its eternal movement; the three supports of the Masonic Temple, itself an embl em of the Univ erse:--Wisdom, or the Infinite Divine Inte lligence; Strength, or Power, the Infinite Divine Will; and Beauty, or the Infinite Divine Harmony, the Eternal Law, by virtue of which t he infinite myriads of suns and worlds flash ever onward in t heir ceaseless revolutions, without clash or conflict, in the Infi nite of space, and change and movement are the law of all created existences. To us, as Masonic Judges , the triangle figure s forth the Pyramids, which, planted firmly as the ev erlasting hills, and accurately adjusted to the four cardinal po ints, defiant of all assaults of men and time, teach us to stand firm and unshak en as they, when our feet are planted u pon the solid truth. It includes a multit ude of geometrical figure s, all having a deep significance to Masons. The trip le triangle is peculiarly sacred, "},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"having ever been among all nations a sym bol of the Deity. Prolonging all the external line s of the Hexagon, which also it includes, we have six smaller triangles , whose bases cut each other in the central point of the Tetr actys, itself always the symbol of the generative power of the Universe, the Su n, Brahma, Osiris, Apollo, Bel, and the Deity Himself. Thus, too, we form twelve still smaller triangles, three times three of whic h compose the Tetractys itself. I refrain from enumera ting all the figures that you may trace within it: but o ne may not be pa ssed unnoticed. T he Hexagon itself faintly images to us a cube, not visible at the first glance, and therefore the fit emblem of that faith in th ings invisible, most essential to salvation. The firs t perfect solid, and reminding you of the cubical stone that sweated blood, and of that deposited by Enoch, it teaches justice, accuracy, and consistency. The infinite divisibility of the triangle teaches the infinity of the Universe, of time, of space, and of the De ity, as do the lines that, diverging from the common centre, ever increase their distance from each other as they are infinitely prolonged. As they may be infinite in number, so are the attributes of Deity infinite; and as they emanate from one-centre and are projected into space, so the whole Universe has emanated from God. Remember also, my Brot her, that you have other duties to perform than those of a judge. You are to inquire into and scrutinize carefully the work of the subordi nate Bodies in Masonry You are to see that recipients of the higher Degrees are not un necessarily multiplied; that improper perso ns are carefully excluded from membership, and that in their li fe and conversation Masons bear testimony to the excellence of our doctrines and the incalculable value of the institution itself. Yo u are to inquire also into your own heart and conduct, and keep ca reful watch over yourself, that you go not astray. If you harbour il l-will and jealou sy, if you are hospitable to intolerance and bi gotry, and churli sh to gentleness and kind affections, opening wide y our heart to o ne and closing its portals to the other, it is time for you to set in order your own temple, or else you wear in vain the name and in signia of a Mason, while yet uninvested with the Masonic nature. Everywhere in the world there is a natural law, that is, a constant mode of action, which seems to be long to the nature of things, to the constitution of t he Universe. This fact is universal. In different departments we call this mode of action by different names, as the law of Matter, the law of Mind, the law of Morals, and the like. We mean by this, a certain mode of action which belongs to the ma terial, mental, or moral fo rces, the mode in which commonly they are found to act, and in whic h it is their ideal to "},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"act always. The ideal la ws of matter we kn ow only from the fact that they are always o beyed. To us the actual obedience is the only evidence of the i deal rule; for in respect to the conduct of the material world, the ideal and the actual are the same. The laws of matter we learn on ly by observation and experience. Before experience of t he fact, no man could fo retell that a body, falling toward the earth, woul d descend sixteen feet the first second, twice that the next, fo ur times the th ird, and sixteen times the fourth. No mode of action in our consciousness anticipates this rule of action in the outer worl d. The same is true of all the laws of matter. The ideal la w is known because it is a fact. The law is imperati ve. It must be obeyed without hesitation. Laws of crystallization , laws of proportion in chemical combination,-- neither in these nor in any other law of Nature is there any margin left for oscill ation of disobedience. Only the primal will of God works in the material world, and no secondary finite will. There are no exceptions to the great general law of Attraction, which binds atom to atom in the body of a ro tifier visible only by aid of a microscope, or b to orb, system to system; gives unity to the world of things, and rounds these worl ds of systems to a Universe. At first there seem to be exceptions to this law, as in growth and decomposition, in the repulsions of electricity; but at length all these are found to be special cases of the one great law of attraction acti ng in various modes. The variety of effect of this la w at first surprises the senses; but in the end the unity of caus e astonishes the cultivated mind. Looked at in reference to this globe, an earthquake is no more than a chink that opens in a garden-walk of a dry day in Summer. A sponge is porous, having small spac es between the solid parts: the solar system is only more porous , having larger room between the several orbs: the Universe yet mo re so, with spaces between the systems, as small, compared with infinite space, as those between the atoms that compose the bul k of the smalle st invisible animalcule, of which millions swim in a drop of salt-water. The same attraction holds together the animalcule, the sponge, the system, and the Univ erse. Every particle of ma tter in that Universe is related to each and all the other particle s; and attraction is their common bond. In the spiritual world, the worl d of human consci ousness, there is also a law, an ideal mode of action for the spiritual forces of man. The law of Justice is as universal an one as the law of Attraction; though we ar e very far from being able to reconcile all the phenomena of Nature with it. The lark has the same ri ght in our view, to live, to sing, to dart at pleasure through the ambient "},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"atmosphere, as the haw k has to ply his str ong wings in the Summer sunshine: and yet the hawk poun ces on and devours the harmless lark, as it devours the worm , and as the worm devours the animalcule; and, so far as we kn ow, there is nowher e, in any future state of animal existence, any compensation for this apparent injustice. Among the bees, one rules, while the others obey --some work, while others are idle. With the small ants, the soldiers feed on the proceeds of the workmen's labour. The lion lies in wait for and devours the antelope that has apparently as good a right to life as he. Among men, some govern and others serve, capital commands and labour o beys, and one race, s uperior in intellect, avails itself of the strong muscl es of another that is inferior; and yet, for all this , no one impeaches the justice of God. No doubt all these va ried phenomena are cons istent with one great law of justice; and t he only difficulty is that we do not, and no doubt we cannot, underst and that law. It is very easy for some dreaming and visionary t heorist to say that it is most evidently unjust for the lion to devour the deer, and for the eagle to tear and eat the wren; but the trouble is , that we know of no other way, according to the frame, the constitution, and the organs which God has given them, in which the li on and the eagle could manage to live at all. Our little measure of justice is not God's measure. His justice does not require us to reli eve the hard working millions of all labour , to emancipate the serf or slave, unfitted to be free, from all control. No doubt, underneath all the litt le bubbles, whic h are the lives, the wishes, the wills, and the plan s of the two thousand millions or more of human beings on this earth (for bubbles they are, judging by the space and time they occupy in this great and age-outlasting sea of human-kind),--no doubt, underneath them all resides one and th e same eternal force, wh ich they shape into this or the other special form; and over all the same paternal Providence presides, keeping eterna l watch over the little and the great, and producing va riety of effect fr om Unity of Force. It is entirely true to say th at justice is the constitution or fundamental law of the moral Universe, the law of right, a rule of conduct for man (as it is for every other livi ng creature), in all his moral relations. No doubt all human af fairs (like all other affairs), must be subject to that as the law param ount; and what is right agrees therewit h and stands, while what is wrong conflicts with it and falls. The difficulty is that we ever erect our notions of what is right and ju st into the la w of justice, and insist that God shall adopt that as His law; instead of stri ving to learn by observation and re flection what His law is, and then believing that law to be consistent with His infinite justic e, whether it corresponds with our limited notion of just ice, or does not so "},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"correspond. We ar e too wise in our own conc eit, and ever strive to enact our own little no tions into the Universal Laws of God. It might be difficult for man to prove, even to his own satisfaction, how it is right or just for him to subjugate the horse and ox to his se rvice, giving them in return only their daily food, which God has sp read out fo r them on all the green meadows and savannas of the worl d: or how it is just that we should slay and eat the harmless deer that only crops t he green herbage, the buds, and the young leaves, and drinks the fr ee-running water that God made common to all; or the gentle dove, the innocent kid, the many other living th ings that so confi dently trust to our protection;--quite as difficult, per haps, as to prove it just for one man's intellect or even his we alth to make another's strong arms his servants, for daily w ages or for a bare subsistence. To find out this universal law of justice is one thing--to undertake to measure off something with our own li ttle tape-line, and call that God's law of justic e, is another. The great general plan and system, and the great general la ws enacted by God, continually produce what to ou r limited notions is wrong and injustice, which hitherto men have been able to ex plain to their own satisfaction only by the hy pothesis of anot her existence in which all inequalities and injustices in this life will be remedied and compensated for. To our ideas of justice, it is very unjust that the child is made miserable for life by deformity or organic disease, in consequence of the vice s of its father; and yet that is part of the universal law. The ancients said that the child was punished for the sins of its father. We say th at this its deformity or disease is the cons equence of its father's vices; bu t so far as concerns the question of justice or injustice, that is merely the change of a word. It is very easy to lay down a bro ad, general princi ple, embodying our own idea of what is absolute justice, and to insist that everything shall conform to that: to say, \"a ll human affairs must be subject to that as the law pa ramount; what is right agrees therewith and stands, what is wr ong conflicts and falls. Private cohesions of self-love, of friendship , or of patriotism, must all be subordinate to this universal gravitation toward the eternal right.\" The difficulty is that this Universe of necessities God-created, of sequences of caus e and effect, and of life evolved from death, this interminabl e succession and aggregate of cruelties, will not conform to any such absolute principle or arbitrary theory, no matter in wh at sounding words and glittering phrases it may be embodied. Impracticable rules in morals are always injurious; for as all men fall short of compliance with th em, they turn real virtues into "},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"imaginary offenses agains t a forged law. Justic e as between man and man and as between man and the an imals below him, is that which, under and according to the God-cr eated relations existing between them, and the whole aggr egate of circumstance s surrounding them, is fit and right and pr oper to be done, with a view to the general as well as to the individual inte rest. It is not a theoretical principle by which the very re lations that G od has created and imposed on us are to be tr ied, and approv ed or condemned. God has made this gr eat system of the Univ erse, and enacted general laws for its government. Those laws environ ev erything that lives with a mighty network of necessity . He chose to create the tiger with such organs that he cannot crop the grass, but must eat other flesh or starve. He has made man carnivorous also; and some of the smallest birds are as mu ch so as the tiger. In every step we take, in every breath we dr aw, is involved the destr uction of a multitude of animate existences, each, no matter how minut e, as much a living creature as ourself. He has made necessary among mankind a division of labour, intellectual and moral. He has made necessary the varied relations of society and depen dence, of obedienc e and control. What is thus made nece ssary cannot be unjust; for if it be, then God the great Lawgiver is Himself unjust. The evil to be avoided is, the legalization of injustice and wrong un der the false plea of necessity. Out of all the relati ons of life gr ow duties,--as naturally grow and as undeniably, as the l eaves grow upon the trees. If we have the right, creat ed by God's law of necessity, to slay the lamb that we may eat and live, we have no right to torture it in doing so, becaus e that is in no wise necessary. We have the right to live, if we fairly can, by the legitimate exercise of our intellect, and hire or buy the la bour of the strong arms of others, to till our grounds, to dig in our mines, to toil in our manufactories; but we have no right to overwo rk or underpay them. It is not only true that we may learn the moral law of justice, the law of right, by experi ence and observation; but that God has given us a moral faculty, our conscience , which is able to perceive this law directly and immediately, by intuitive perception of it; and it is true that man has in his nature a rule of conduct higher than what he has ever yet come up to,- -an ideal of natu re that shames his actual of history: because man has ever been prone to make necessity, his own necessity, the necessities of society, a plea for injustice. But this notion mu st not be pushed too far--for if we substitute this ideality for ac tuality, then it is equally true that we have within us an ideal rule of righ t and wrong, to which God Himself in His government of the world has never come, and against which He (we say it rever entially) every day offends. We detest the tiger and the wolf for the rapacity and love of blood which are their nature; we revolt against the law by which the "},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"crooked limbs and dise ased organism of the ch ild are the fruits of the father's vices; we even think that a God Omnipotent and Omniscient ought to have permitted no pain, no poverty, no servitude; our ideal of justice is more loft y than the actualities of God. It is well, as all else is well. He has given us that moral sense for wise and be neficent purposes. We accept it as a significant proof of th e inherent loftiness of human nature, that it can entertain an i deal so exalted; and sh ould strive to attain it, as far as we can do so consis tently with the relations which He has created, and the circum.stanc es which surround us and hold us captive. If we faithfully use this facult y of conscience; if, applying it to the existing relations and circumst ances, we develop it and all its kindred powers, and so deduce t he duties that out of these relation.s and those circumstanc es, and limited and qualified by them, arise and become obligatory up on us, then we learn justice, the law of right, th e divine rule of conduc t for human life. But if we undertake to define and settle \"the mode of action that belongs to the infinitely perfect nature of God,\" and so set up any ideal rule, beyond all human reach, we soon come to judge and condemn His work and the relations which it has pleased Him in His infinite wisdom to create. A sense of justice belongs to hum an nature, and is a part of it. Men find a deep, permanent, and inst inctive delight in justice, not only in the outward effe cts, but in the inward cause, and by their nature love this law of right, this reasonable rule of conduct, this justice, with a deep and abi ding love. Justice is the object of the conscience, and fits it as light fits the eye and truth the mind. Justice keeps just relations bet ween men. It hol ds the balance between nation and nation, between a man and his family, tribe, nation, and race, so that his absolute rights and theirs do not interfere, nor their ul timate interests ever clash, nor the eternal interests of the one prove antagonist ic to those of all or of any other one. This we must believe, if we believe that God is just. We must do justice to all, and demand it of all; it is a universal human debt, a universal human claim. But we may err greatly in defining what that just ice is. The temporary in terests, and what to human view are the right s, of men, do oft en interfere and clash. The life-interests of the individual ofte n conflict with the permanent interests and welfare of society; an d what may seem to be the natural rights of one class or race, with those of another. It is not true to say that \"one man, however little, must not be sacrificed to another, however great , to a majority, or to all men.\" That is not only a falla cy, but a most dan gerous one. Often "},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"one man and many men must be sacrificed, in t he ordinary sense of the term, to the intere st of the many. It is a comfortable fallacy to the selfish; for if they ca nnot, by the law of justice, be sacrificed for the common good, th en their country has no right to demand of them self-sacrifice; a nd he is a fool who lays down his life, or sacrifices his estate, or even his luxuries, to insure the safety or prosperity of his coun try. According to that doctrine, Curtius was a fool, and Leonidas an idiot; and to die for one's country is no longer beautiful and gl orious, but a mere absurdity. Then it is no longer to be asked that the common soldier shall receive in his bosom the sword or bayonet-thr ust which otherwise would let out the life of the great commande r on whose fate hang the liberties of his country, and the welf are of millions yet unborn. On the contrary, it is certain that necessity rules in all the affairs of men, and that the interest and even the life of one man must often be sacrificed to t he interest and we lfare of his country. Some must ever lead th e forlorn hope: t he missionary must go among savages, bear ing his life in his hand; the physician must expose himself to pestilence for th e sake of others; the sailor, in the frail boat upon th e wide ocean, escaped from the fo undering or burning ship, must step calmly in to the hungry wate rs, if the lives of the passengers can be saved only by the sacrifice of his own; the pilot must stand fi rm at the wheel, and le t the flames scorch away his own life to insure the common safe ty of those whom the doomed vessel bears. The mass of men are al ways looking for what is just. All the vast machinery which makes up a State, a world of States, is, on the part of the people, an at tempt to organize, not that ideal justice which finds fault with God's ordina nces, but that practical justice which may be attained in the actual organization of the world. The minute and wide-extending civil machinery whic h makes up the law and the courts, with all their office rs and implement s, on the part of mankind, is chiefl y an effort to reduce to practice the theory of right. Constituti ons are made to establish justice; the decisions of courts are reported to help us judge more wisely in time to come. The nation aims to get together the mo st nearly just men in the State, that they may incorporate into statutes their aggregate sense of what is righ t. The people wish law to be embodied justice, admi nistered without passion . Even in the wildest ages there has been a wi ld popular justice, but always mixed with passion and administered in hate; for justice takes a rude form with rude men, and beco mes less mixed with hate and passion in more civilized communities. Every prog ressive State revi ses its statutes and revolutionizes its co nstitution from time to time, seeking to come closer to the ut most possible practical justice and right; and sometimes, follow ing theorists and dreamers in their adoration for the ideal, by erecting into law positive principl e of theoretical "},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"right, works practical injustice, and then has to retrace its steps. In literature men always look fo r practical justice, and desire that virtue should have its own reward, and vice its appropriate punishment. They are ev er on the side of just ice and humanity; and the majority of them have an i deal justice, better than the things about them, juster than the law: fo r the law is ever imperfect, not attaining even to the ut most practicable degr ee of perfection; and no man is as just as his own idea of possible and practicable justice. His passions and his nece ssities ever ca use him to sink below his own ideal. The ideal ju stice which men ever look up to and strive to rise toward, is tr ue; but it will not be realized in this world. Yet we must approach as near to it as practicable, as we should do toward t hat ideal democracy that \"now floats before the eyes of earnest and religious me n,--fairer than the Republic of Plato, or More's Utopi a, or the Golden Age of fabled memory,\" only taking care that we do not, in striving to reach and ascend to the impossible ideal, negl ect to seize upon a nd hold fast to the possible actual. To aim at the be st, but be content with the best possible, is the only tr ue wisdom. To insist on the absolute right, and throw out of the calculation the impo rtant and al l controlling element of necessity , is the folly of a mere dreamer. In a world inhabit ed by men with bodies, and necessarily with bodily wants and animal passions, the time will never come when there will be no want, no oppressi on, nor servitude, no fear of man no fear of God, but only Love. That can never be while there are inferior intellect, indulgence in low vice, improvidence, indolence, awful visi tations of pestilence and war and famine, earthquake and volcano, that must of necessity cause men to want, and serve, and su ffer, and fear. But still the ploughsha re of justice is ev er drawn through and through the field of t he world, uproot ing the savage plants. Ever we see a continual an d progressive trium ph of the right. The injustice of England lo st her America, the fairest jewel of her crown. The injustice of Napoleon bore him to the ground more than the snows of Russia did, and exil ed him to a barr en rock there to pine away and die, his life a warning to bid mankind be just. We intuitively underst and what justice is , better than we can depict it. What it is in a given case depends so much on circumstances, that de finitions of it are wh olly deceitful. Often it would be unjust to society to do what would, in the absence of that consideration, be pronounced just to the i ndividual. General propositions of man's right to this or that are ever fallacious: and not infrequently it would be most unjust to the individual "},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"himself to do for him what the theorist, as a general proposition, would say was ri ght and his due. We should ever do un to others what, under th e same circumstances, we ought to wish, and should have the right to wish they should do unto us. There are many cases, cases constant ly occurring, where one man must take care of himself, in pr eference to another, as where two struggle for the posse ssion of a plan k that will save one, but cannot uphold both; or where, assa iled, he can save his own life only by slaying his adv ersary. So one must prefer the safety of his country to the li ves of her enemies; and sometimes, to insure it, to those of he r own innocent citizens. . The retreating general may cut away a bridge behind him, to delay pursuit and save the main body of his army, though he thereby surrenders a detach ment, a battalion, or even a corps of his own force to certain destruction. These are not departures from justice; though, like other instances where the injury or deat h of the indivi dual is the sa fety of the many, where the intere st of one individual , class, or race is postponed to that of th e public, or of the s uperior race, they may infringe some dreamer's ideal rule of justic e. But every departure from real, practical justice is no doubt attended wi th loss to the unjust man, though th e loss is not report ed to the public. Injustice, public or private, li ke every other sin and wrong, is inevitably followed by its consequences. The se lfish, the grasping, the inhuman, the fraudulently unjust, the ungenerous employer, and the cruel master, are detested by the great popular heart; while the kind master, the liberal em ployer, the gener ous, the humane, and the just have the good opinion of all men, and even envy is a tribute to their virtues . Men honour all who st and up for truth and right, and never shrink. The wo rld builds monuments to its patriots. Four great statesmen, organizers of t he right, embalmed in stone, look down upon the lawgivers of France as they pass to their hall of legislat ion, silent orators to tell how nations love the just. How we revere the marble lineaments of th ose just judges, Jay and Marshall, that look so calmly toward the living Bench of the Supreme Court of the United States! What a mo nument Washington has built in the heart of America and all the world, not because he dreamed of an imprac ticable ideal justice, but by his constant effort to be practically just ! But necessity alone, and the greates t good of the gr eatest number, can legitimately interfere with th e dominion of abso lute and ideal justice. Government sh ould not foster the strong at the expense of the weak, nor protect the capita list and tax th e labourer. The powerful should not seek a monop oly of developm ent and enjoyment; not prudence only and th e expedient for to- day should be appealed to by statesmen, but conscience and the right: justice should not "},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"be forgotten in look ing at interest, no r political morality neglected for political economy: we should not have national housekeeping instead of national organiza tion on the basis of right. We may well differ as to the ab stract right of many things; for every such question has many sides, and few men look at all of them, many only at one. But we all readily recognize cruelty, unfairness, inhumanity, partiality , over-reaching, hard-dealing, by their ugly and familiar lineament s, and in order to know and to hate and despise them, we do not need to sit as a Court of Errors and Appeals to revise and re verse God's Providences. There are certainly great evils of civilizati on at this day, and many questions of hum anity long adjour ned and put of f. The hideous aspect of pauperism, the debasement and vice in our cities, tell us by their eloquent silenc e or in inarticulate mutterings, that the rich and the powe rful and the inte llectual do no t do their duty by the poor, the feeble, and the igno rant; and every wretched woman who lives, Heaven scarc e knows how, by making shirts at sixpence each, attests the injustice and inhumanity of man. There are cruelties to slaves, and wors e cruelties to animals, each disgraceful to their perpetrators, a nd equally unwa rranted by the lawful relation of control and dependenc e which it has pleased God to create. A sentence is written against all th at is unjust, written by God in the nature of man and in the nature of the Universe, because it is in the nature of the Infinite God. Fidelity to your faculties, trust in their convictions, that is justice to y ourself; a life in obedience thereto, that is justice toward men. No wrong is really successful. The gain of injust ice is a loss, its pleasure suffering. Iniquity often seems to prosper, but its success is its defeat and shame. Afte r a long while, the day of reckoning ever comes, to nation as to individual. The knave deceives himself. The miser, starving his brother's body , starves also his own soul, and at death shall creep out of his great estate of injustice, poor and naked and miserable. Whoso escapes a duty av oids a gain. Outward judgment often fails, inward justice never. Let a man try to love the wrong and to do th e wrong, it is eatin g stones and not bread, the swift feet of justice are upon him, follow ing with woolen tread, and her iron hands are round his neck. No man can escape from this, any more t han from himself. Justic e is the angel of God that flies from East to West; and w here she stoops her broad wings, it is to bring the counsel of God, and f eed mankind with angel's bread. We cannot underst and the moral Universe. The arc is a long one, and our eyes reach but a li ttle way; we cannot ca lculate the curve and "},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"complete the figure by the experi ence of sight; but we can divine it by conscience, and we surely know that it bends toward justice. Justice will not fail , though wickedness appear s strong, and has on its side the armies and thrones of power, the riches and the glory of the world, and though poor men crouch down in despair. Justice will not fail and perish out from the world of men! nor will what is really wrong and contrary to God's real law of justice continually endure. The Power, th e Wisdom, and the Justice of God are on the side of ev ery just thought, and it cannot fail, any more than God Himself can perish. In human affairs, the justice of God must wo rk by human means. Men are the instruments of God's pr inciples; our morality is the instrument of His just ice, which, incomprehens ible to us, seems to our short vision often to work in justice. but will at some time still the oppressor's br utal laugh. Justice is the rule of conduct written in the nature of mankind. We may, in our daily life, in house or field or shop, in the of fice or in the court, help to prepare the way for th e commonwealth of just ice which is slowly, but, we would fain hope, surely approaching. Al l the justice we mature will bless us here and herea fter, and at our death we shall leave it added to the common store of human- kind. And every Mason who, content to do that which is possible and practicable, does and enforces justice, may help deepen t he channel of human morality in which God's justice runs; and so th e wrecks of evil that now check and obstruct the stream may the sooner be sw ept out and borne away by the resistless tide of Omnipoten t Right. Let us, my Brother, in this as in all else, endeavour al ways to perform the duties of a good Mason and a good man.  XXXII SUBLIME PRINCE OF THE ROYAL SECRET. [Master of Royal Secret.] The Occult Scienc e of the Ancient Magi was concealed under the shadows of the Ancient Mysteries: it was imperfectly revealed or rather disfigured by the Gnostics: it is guessed at under the obscu rities that cover the pretended crimes of the Templars; and it is found enveloped in enigmas th at seem impenetrable, in "},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"the Rites of the Highest Masonry. Magism was the Science of Abraham and Orpheus, of Confucius and Zoroaster. It was the dogmas of this Science that were engraven on the ta bles of stone by Hanoch and Trismegistus. Mo ses purified and re-veiled them, for that is the mean ing of the word reveal. He covered them with a new ve il, when he made of the Holy Kabalah the exclusive herit age of the people of Israel, and the inviolable Secret of its priests. The Mysteries of Thebes and Eleusis pres erved among the nations some symbols of it, alr eady altered, and t he mysterious key whereof was lost among the instruments of an ever-growing superstition. Je rusalem, the murderess of her prophets, and so often prostitu ted to the false gods of the Syrians and Baby lonians, had at length in its turn lost the Holy Word, when a Prophet announced to the Magi by the consecra ted Star of Initiation, came to rend asunder t he worn veil of the old Temple, in order to give the Church a new tissue of legends and symbols, that still and ever conceals from the Profane, and ever preserves to the Elect the same truths. It was the remembrance of this scientific and religious Absolute, of this doctrine t hat is summed up in a word, of this Word, in fine, alternately lost and found again, that was tr ansmitted to the El ect of all the Ancient Initiations: it wa s this same remembrance, preserved, or perhaps profane d in the celebrated Order of the Templars, that became for all the secret associations, of the Rose-Cro ix, of the Illuminati, and of the Hermetic Freemasons, the reason of their strange rites, of their signs more or less conventional, and, above all, of their mutual devotedness and of their power. The Gnostics caused the Gnosis to be proscribed by the Christians, and the offici al Sanctuary was closed against the high initiation . Thus the Hierarchy of Knowledge was compromitted by the violences of usurping ignorance, and the disor ders of the Sanctuary are reproduced in the State; for always, willingly or unwillingly, the King is su stained by the Priest, and it is from the eternal Sanctuary of the Divine instruction that t he Powers of the Earth, to insure themselves durability, must receive their consecration and their force. The Hermetic Science of t he early Christian ages, "},{"pageNumber":552,"pageContent":"cultivated also by Geber, Alfarabius, and others of the Arabs, studied by the Chiefs of the Templars, and embodied in certain symbols of the higher Degrees of Freemasonry, may be accurate ly defined as the Kabalah in active realization,or t he Magic of Wo rks. It has three analogous Degrees, re ligious, philosophical, and physical realization. Its religious realization is the durable foundation of the true Empire and the tr ue Priesthood that rule in the realm of human inte llect: its philosophical realization is the establishm ent of absolute Doctrine, known in all times as the \"H oly Doctrine,\" and of which PLUTARCH, in the Treatise \" de Iside et Osiride,\" speaks at large but mysteriously ; and of a Hierarchical instruction to se cure the uninterrupted succession of Adepts among the In itiates: its physical realization is the discovery and applicatio n, in the Microcosm, or Little World, of the crea tive law that incessantly peoples the great Universe. Measure a corner of the Cr eation, and multiply that space in proportional pr ogression, and the entire Infinite will multiply its circles filled with universes, which will pass in proportional segments between the ideal and elo ngating branches of your Compass. Now suppose that fr om any point whatever of the Infinite above you a han d holds another Compass or a Square, the lines of th e Celestial triangle will necessarily meet those of the Compass of Science, to form the Mysterious Star of Solomon. All hypotheses scientifical ly probable are the last gleams of the twilight of knowledge, or its last shadows. Faith begins where Reason sinks exhausted. Beyond the human Reason is the Divine Reason, to our feebleness the great Absurdity, the Infinite Absurd, which confounds us and wh ich we believe. For the Master, the Compass of Fait h is above the Square of Reason; but both rest upon the Holy Scriptures and combine to form the Bl azing Star of Truth. All eyes do not see alike. Even the visible creation is not, for all who l ook upon it, of one form and one color. Our brain is a book printed within and without, and the two writings are, with all me n, more or less confused. "},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"The primary tradition of th e single revelation has been preserved under the name of the \"Kabalah,\" by the Priesthood of Israel. The Ka balistic doctrine, which was also the dogma of th e Magi and of Hermes, is contained in the Sepher Yets airah, the S ohar, and the Talmud. According to that doctrine, the Absolute is the Being, in which The Word Is, the Word that is the utterance and expression of being and life. Magic is that which it is; it is by itself, like the mathematics; for it is th e exact and absolute science of Nature and its laws. Magic is the science of the Ancient Magi: and the Christian religion, which has imposed silence on the lying oracles, and put an end to the prestiges of the false Gods, itself reveres those Magi who came from the East, guided by a Star, to adore the Saviour of the world in His cradle. Tradition also gives these Magi the title of \"Kings;\" because initiation into M agism constitutes a genuine royalty; and because the grand art of the Magi is styled by all the Adepts, \"T he Royal Art,\" or the Holy Realm or Empire, Sanctum Regnum. The Star which guided them is that same Blazing Star, the image whereof we find in all in itiations. To the Alchemists it is the sign of the Quintessence; to the Magists, the Grand Arcanu m; to the Kabalists, the Sacred Pentagram. The study of this Pentagram could not but lead the Magi to the knowledge of the New Name which was about to raise itself above all names, and cause all creatures capabl e of adoration to bend the knee. Magic unites in o ne and the same science, whatsoever Philosophy can possess that is most certain, and Religion of the Infall ible and the Eternal. It perfectly and incontestably reconciles these two terms that at first blush seem so opposed to each other; faith and reason, science and creed, au thority and liberty. It supplies the human mind with an instrument of philosophical and religious certainty, exact as the mathematics, and accounting for the infa llibility of the mathematics themselves. "},{"pageNumber":554,"pageContent":"Thus there is an Absolute , in the matters of the Intelligence and of Faith. The Supreme Reason has not left the gleams of the huma n understanding to vacillate at hazard. There is an inc ontestable verity, there is an infallible method of knowi ng this verity, and by the knowledge of it, those who a ccept it as a rule may give their will a sovereign power that will make them the masters of all inferior things and of all errant spirits; that is to say, will make them the Arbiters and Kings of the World. Science has its nights and it s dawns, because it gives the intellectual world a life which has its regulated movements and its progre ssive phases. It is with Truths, as with the lumin ous rays: nothi ng of what is concealed is lost; but also, nothing of what is discovered is absolutely ne w. God has been pleased to give to Science, which is the reflection of His Glory, the Seal of His Eternity. It is not in the books of the Philosophers, but in the religious symbolism of the An cients, that we must look for the footprints of Scie nce, and re-discover the Mysteries of Know ledge. The Priests of Egypt knew, better than we do, the laws of movement and of life. They knew how to temper or intensify action by reaction; and readily foresaw the real ization of these effects, the causes of wh ich they had determined. The Columns of Seth, Enoch, So lomon, and Hercules have symbolized in the Ma gian traditions th is universal law of the Equilibrium; and the Science of the Equilibrium or balancing of Forc es had led the Initiates to that of the universal gravitation ar ound the centres of Life, Heat, and Light. Thales and Pythagoras lear ned in the Sanctuaries of Egypt that the Eart h revolved around the Sun; but they did not attempt to make th is generally known, because to do so it would have been necessary to reveal one of the great Secrets of the Temple, that double law of attraction and radiation or of sympathy and antipathy, of fixedness and movement, which is the principle of Creation, and the perpetual cause of life. This Truth was ridiculed by t he Christian Lactant ius, as it was long after sought to be proven a falsehood by persecution, by Papal Rome. So the philosophers reas oned, while the Priests, without replying to them or even smiling at their "},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"errors, wrote, in those Hie roglyphics that created all dogmas and all poetry, t he Secrets of the Truth. When Truth comes into the wo rld, the Star of Knowledge advises the Magi of it, and they hasten to adore the Infant who creates the Future. It is by means of the Intelligence of the Hierar chy and the practice of obedience, that one obtains Initiation. If the Rulers have the Divine Right to govern, the true Initiate will cheerfully obey. The orthodox traditions we re carried fr om Chaldea by Abraham. They rei gned in Egypt in the time of Joseph, together with the knowledge of the True God. Moses carried Orthodoxy out of Eg ypt, and in the Secret Traditions of the Kabalah we find a Theo logy entire, perfect, unique, like that which in Christianity is most grand and be st explained by th e Fathers and the Doctors, the whole with a consistency and a harmoniousness which it is not as yet given to the world to comprehend. The Sohar , which is the Key of the Holy Books, opens also all the depths a nd lights, all the obscurities of the Anci ent Mythologies and of the Sciences originally concealed in the Sanctuaries. It is true that the Secret of th is Key must be known, to enable one to make use of it, and that for even the most penetrating intellects , not initiated in this Secret, the Sohar is absolu tely incomprehensible and almost illegible. The Secret of the Occult Sc iences is that of Nature itself, the Secret of the generation of t he Angels and Worlds, that of the Omnipotence of God. \"Ye shall be like the Eloh im, knowing good and evil,\" had the Serpent of Genesis said, and the Tree of Knowledge became t he Tree of Death. For six thousand years the Martyrs of K nowledge toil and die at the foot of this tree, that it may again become the Tree of Life. The Absolute sought for unsu ccessfully by the insensate and found by the Sages, is t he TRUTH, the REALITY, and the REASON of the uni versal equilibrium! Equilibrium is the Harmon y that results from the analogy of Contraries. "},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"Until now, Humanity has been endeavoring to stand on one foot; sometimes on one, sometimes on the other. Civilizations have risen and perished, either by the anarchical insanity of Desp otism, or by the despotic anarchy of Revolt. To organize Anarchy, is the problem which the revolutionists have and will eternally have to resolve. It is the rock of Sisyphus that will always fall back upon them. To exist a sing le instant, they are and always will be by fatality reduced to improvise a despotism without other reason of existence than necessity, and which, cons equently, is violent and blind as Necessity. We e scape from the harmonious monarchy of Reason, only to fall under the irregular dictatorship of Folly. Sometimes superstitious en thusiasms, sometimes the miserable calculations of th e materialist instinct have led astray the nations, and Go d at last urges the world on toward believing Reason and reasonable Beliefs. We have had proph ets enough without philosophy, and philosophers withou t religion; the bl ind believers and the sceptics resemble each ot her, and are as far the one as the other from the eternal salvation. In the chaos of universal doubt and of th e conflicts of Reason and Faith, the great men and Seers have been but infirm and morbid artists, seeking the beau-ideal at the risk and peril of t heir reason and life. Living only in the hope to be crowned, they are the first to do what Pythagoras in so touching a manner prohibits in his admirable Symbols; they rend crowns, and tread them under foot. Light is the equilibriu m of Shadow and Lucidity. Movement is the equilibrium of Iner tia and Activity. Authority is the equilibrium of Liberty and Power. Wisdom is equilibrium in th e Thoughts, which are the scintillations and rays of the Intellect. Virtue is equilibrium in t he Affections: Beauty is harmonious proportion in Forms. The beautiful lives are t he accurate ones, and the magnificences of Nature ar e an algebra of graces and splendors. Everything just is beaut iful; everything beautiful "},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"ought to be just. There is, in fact, no Nothin g, no void Emptiness, in the Universe. From the uppe r or outer surface of our atmosphere to that of the Sun, and to those of the Planets and remote Stars, in diff erent directions, Science has for hundreds of centuries imagined that there was simple, void, empty Space. Comparing finite knowledge with the Infini te, the Philosophers know little more than the apes ! In all that \"void\" space are the Infinite Forces of God, acting in an infinite variety of directions, back and forth, an d never for an instant inactive. In all of it, active through the whole of its Infinity, is t he Light that is the Visible Manifestation of God. The earth and every other planet and sphere that is not a Centre of Li ght, carries its cone of shadow with it as it flies and fl ashes round in its orbit; but the darkne ss has no home in the Universe. To illuminate th e sphere on one side, is to project a cone of darkness on the other; a nd Error also is the Shadow of the Truth with which God illuminates the Soul. In all that \"Void,\" also, is the Mysterious and ever Active Electricity, and Heat, and the Omnipresent Ether. At the will of God the Invisible becomes Visible. Two invisible gases , combined by the action of a Force of God, and compresse d, become a nd remain the water that fills the great ba sins of the seas, flows in the rivers and rivulets, le aps forth from the rocks or springs, drops upon the earth in rains, or whitens it with snows, and bridges t he Danubes with ice, or gathers in vast reservoirs in the earth's bosom. God manifested fills all the ext ension that we foolishly call Empty Space and the Void. And everywhere in the Univer se, what we call life and Movement results from a cont inual conflict of Forces or Impulses. Whenever that acti ve antagonism ceases, the immobility and inertia, which are Death, result. If, says the Kabalah, the Justice of God, which is Severity or the Female, alone reigned, creation of imperfect beings such as m an would from the beginning have been impossible, because Sin being congenital with Humanity, the Infinite Just ice, measuring the Sin by the Infinity of the God of fended against, must have annihilated Humanity at th e instant of its creation; and not only Humanity but the Angels, since these also, "},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"like all created by God and less than perfect, are sinful. Nothing imperfect w ould have been possible. If, on the other hand, the Mercy or Benignity of God, the Male, were in no wise c ounteracted, Sin would go unpunished, and the Universe fall into a chaos of corruption. Let God but rep eal a single principle or law of chemical attraction or sym pathy, and the antagonistic forces equilibrated in matter, released from constraint, would instantaneo usly expand all that we term matter into impalpable and invisible gases, such as water or steam is, when , confined in a cylinder and subjected to an immense degree of that mysterious force of the Deity which we call \"heat,\" it is by its expansion released. Incessantly the great current s and rivers of air flow and rush and roll from the equa tor to the frozen polar regions, and back fr om these to the torrid equatorial realms. Necessarily incident to these great, immense, equilibrated and beneficent mo vements, caused by the antagonism of equatorial heat and polar cold, are the typhoons, tornadoes, and cycl ones that result from conflicts between th e rushing currents. These and the benign trade-winds resu lt from the same great law. God is omnipotent; but effe cts without causes are impossible, and these effect s cannot but sometimes be evil. The fire would not wa rm, if it could not also burn, the human flesh. The mo st virulent poisons are the most sovereign rem edies, when gi ven in due proportion. The Evil is th e shadow of t he Good, and inseparable from it. The Divine Wisdom limits by equipoise the Omnipotence of the Divine Will or Powe r, and the resu lt is Beauty or Harmony. The arch rests not on a singl e column, but springs from one on either side. So is it also with the Divine Justice and Me rcy, and with the Human Reason and Human Faith. That purely scholastic Theology, issue of the Categories of Aristotle and of the Sentences of Peter Lombard, that logi c of the syllogism which argues instead of reasoni ng, and finds a re sponse to every thing by subtilizing on te rms, wholly ignored the Kabalastic dogm a and wandered of f into the drear vacuity of darkness. It was less a philosophy or a wisdom than a philosophica l automaton, replying by "},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":"means of springs, and unco iling its theses like a wheeled movement. It was no t the human verb but the monotonous cry of a machine, the inanim ate speech of an Android. It was the fata l precision of mechanism, instead of a free application of rational necessities. ST THOMAS AQUINAS crushed wi th a single blow all this scaffolding of words buil t one upon th e other, by proclaiming the eternal Em pire of Reason, in that magnificent sentence, \"A th ing is not just because GOD wills it,- but GOD wills it because it is just.\" The proximate consequence of this proposition, arguing from the greater to the less, was this: \"A thing is not true because ARISTOTLE has said it; but ARISTOTLE could not reasonably say it unless it was true. Seek then, first of, all, the TRUTH and JU STICE, and the Science of ARISTOTLE will be giv en you in addition.\" It is the fine dr eam of the greatest of the Poets, that Hell, become useless, is to be closed at length, by the aggrandizement of H eaven; that the pr oblem of Evil is to receive its final so lution, and Good alone, necessary and triumphant, is to reign in Eternity. So the Persian dogma taught that AHRIMAN and his subordinate ministers of Evil were at last, by means of a Redeemer and Medi ator, to be reco nciled with Deity, and all Evil to end. But unf ortunately, th e philosopher forgets all the laws of equilibrium, and seeks to absorb the Light in a splendor wi thout shadow, and movement in an absolute repose that would be the cessation of life. So long as there shall be a visible light, there will be a s hadow proporti onal to this Light, and whatever is illu minated will cast its cone of shadow. Repose will neve r be happiness, if it is not balanced by an analogous and contrary movement. This is the immutable law of Nature , the Eternal Will of the JUSTICE which is GOD. The same reason necessita tes Evil and Sorrow in Humanity which renders indi spensable the bitterness of the waters of the seas. He re also, Harmony can result only from the analogy of contraries, and what is above exists by reason of what is below. It is the depth that determines the height; and if the valleys are filled up, the mountains disappear: so, if the shadows are effaced, the Light is annul led, which is only visible by the graduated c ontrast of gloo m and splendor, and universal obscurity will be produced by an immense dazzling. Even the colors in the Light only exist by the presence of the shad ow: it is the threefold alliance of the day and night, the luminous image of "},{"pageNumber":560,"pageContent":"the dogma, the Light made S hadow, as the Saviour is the Logos made man: a nd all this reposes on the same law, the primary law of creati on, the single and absolute law of Nature, that of t he distinction and harmonious ponderation of the contrary forces in the universal equipoise. The two great columns of the Temple that symbolizes the Universe are Necessity, or th e omnipotent Will of God, which nothing can disobey , and Liberty, or the free-will of His creatures. Apparently and to our human reason antagonistic, the same Reason is not incapable of comprehending how they can be in equipoise. The Infinite Power and Wisdom could so plan the Universe and the Infinite Succession of things as to leave man free to act, and, foreseeing what each would at every instant think and do, to make of the free-will and free-action of each an instru ment to aid in effecting its general purpose. For even a man, foreseeing that another will do a certain act, and in nowise controlling or even influenci ng him may use that action as an instrument to ef fect his own purposes. The Infinite Wisdom of God foresees what each will do, and uses it as an instrument , by the exertion of His Infinite Power, which yet does not cont rol the Human action so as to annihilate its freedom The result is Harmony, the third column that upholds the Lodge. The same Harmony results from the equipoise of Necessity and Liberty. The will of God is not for an instant defeated nor thwarted, and this is the Divine Victory; and yet He does not tempt nor constrain men to do Evil, and thus His Infinite Glory is unimpaired. The result is Stability, Cohesi on, and Permanence in the Universe, and undivided Dominion and Auto cracy in the Deity. And these, Victory, Glory, St ability, and Domi nion, are the last four Sephiroth of the Kabalah. I AM, God said to Moses, t hat which Is, Was and Shall forever Be. But the Very God, in His unmanifested Essence, conceived of as not yet having created and as Alone, has no Name. Such wa s the doctrine of all the ancient Sages, and it is so expressly declared in the Kabalah. is the Name of the Deity manifested in a single act, that of Creat ion, and cont aining within Himself, in idea and actualit y, the whole Universe, to be invested with form a nd be materially developed during the eternal succession of ages. As God never WAS NOT, so He never THOUGHT not, and the Universe has no "},{"pageNumber":561,"pageContent":"more had a beginnin g than the Divine Thought of which it is the uttera nce,--no more than the Deity Himself. The duration of the Universe is but a point halfway upon the infinite line of eternity ; and God was not inert and uncreativ e during the eterni ty that stretches behind that point. Th e Archetype of t he Universe did never not exist in the Divine Mind. The Word was in the BEGINNING with God, and WAS God. And the Ineffable NAME is that, not of the Very E ssence but of the Absolute, manifested as Being or Ex istence. For Existence or Being, said the Philosophers , is limitation; and the Very Deity is not limited nor defined, but is all that may possibly be, be sides all that is , was, and shall be. Reversing the letters of the Ineffa ble Name, and dividing it, it becomes bi -sexual, as the word Yud-He or JAH is, and discloses t he meaning of much of the obscure language of the Kaba lah, and is The Highest of which the Columns Jachin an d Boaz are th e symbol. \"In the image of Deity,\" we are told, \"God cr eated the Man; Male and Female created He them:\" and the writer, symbolizing the Divine by t he Human, then tells us that the woman, at first contai ned in the man, was taken from his side. So Minerva, Goddess of Wisdom, was born, a woman and in armor, of t he brain of Jove; Isis was the sister before she was the wife of Osiris, and within BRAHM, the So urce of all, the Very God, without sex or name, was developed MA YA, the Mother of all that is. The WORD is the Firs t and Only-begotten of the Father; and the aw e with which the Highest Mysteries were regarded has imposed si lence in respect to the Nature of the Holy Spirit. The Word is Light, and the Life of Humanity. It is for the Adepts to und erstand the meaning of the Symbols. Return now, with us, to the Degrees of the Blue Masonry, and for your la st lesson, receive the explanation of one of their Symbols. You see upon the altar of th ose Degrees the SQUARE and the COMPASS, and you remember how they lay upon the altar in each Degree. The SQUARE is an instrument adapted for plane surfaces only, and therefore appropr iate to Geometry, or measurement of the Earth, which appears to be, and was "},{"pageNumber":562,"pageContent":"by the Ancients supposed to be, a plane. The COMPASS is an instrument that has relation to spheres and spherical surfaces, and is adapted to spherical trigonometry, or th at branch of mathem atics which deals with the Heavens and the or bits of the planetary bodies. The SQUARE, therefore, is a natural and appropriate Symbol of this Earth and the things that belong to it, are of it, or concern it . The Compass is an equally natural and appropriate Sym bol of the H eavens, and of all celestial things and celestial natures. You see at the beginning of this reading, an old Hermetic Symbol, copied fr om the MATE RIA PRIMA of Valentinus, printed at Fr ankfurt, in 1613, with a treatise entitled \"A ZOTEI.\" Upon it you see a Triangle upon a Square, both of these contai ned in a circle; and above this, standing upon a dr agon, a human body, with two arms only,but two head s,one male and the other female. By the side of the male head is th e Sun, and by that of the female head, the Moon, th e crescent within the circle of the full m oon. And the hand on the male side holds a Compa ss, and that on th e female side, a Square. The Heavens and the Earth we re personified as Deities, even among the Ary an Ancestors of th e European nations of the Hindus, Zends, Bactri ans, and Persians; and the Rig Veda Sanhita contains hymns addressed to them as gods. They were deified also among the Phoenicians; and among the Greeks OURANOS and GEA, Heaven and Earth, were sung as the most anc ient of the Deities, by Hesiod. It is the great, fertile, beautiful MOTHER, Earth, that produces, with limitless profusion of beneficence, everything that ministers to the needs, to the comfort, and to the luxury of man. From her teeming and inexhaustible bosom come th e fruits, the grain, the flowers, in their season. Fr om it comes a ll that feeds the animals which serve man as labourers and for food. She, in the fair Springtim e, is green with abundant grass, and the tree s spring from her so il, and from her teeming vitality take their wealth of green leaves. In her womb are found the useful and valuable minerals; hers are the seas th e swarm with life ; hers the rivers that furnish food and irri gation, and th e mountains that send down the stream s which swell into these "},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"rivers; hers the forests that feed the sacred fires for the sacrifices, and blaze upon the domestic hearths. The EARTH, therefore, the great PRODUCER, was always represented as a female, as the MOTHER,--Great, Bounteous, Benefic ent Mother Earth. On the other hand, it is t he light and heat of the Sun in the Heavens, and the rain s that seem to come from them, that in the Spring time make fruitful this bountifully-producing Earth, that restore life and warmth to her veins, chil led by Winter, set running free her streams, an d beget, as it we re, that greenness and that abundanc e of which she is so prolific. As the procreative and generative age nts, the Heav ens and the Sun have always been regar ded as male; as the generators that fructify the Earth and cause it to produce. The Hermaphroditic figure is the Symbol of the double nature anciently assigned to the Deity, as Generator and Producer, as BRAHM and MAYA among the Aryans, Osiris and Isis among the Egyptians. As the Sun was male, so the Moon was female ; and Isis was both the sister and the wife of Osiris. The Compass, therefore, is the Hermetic Symbol of the Creative De ity, and the Square of the producti ve Earth or Universe. From the Heavens come t he spiritual and immortal portion of man; from the Earth his ma terial and mortal portion. The Hebrew Genesis says that YEHOUAH formed man of the dust of the Ea rth, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life. Through the seven planetary spheres, represent ed by the Mystic Ladder of the Mithriac Initiations, a nd it by that which Jacob saw in his dream (not with three, but with seven steps), the Souls, emanating from the Deit y, descended, to be united to t heir human bodies; and through those seven spheres they must re-a scend, to return to their origin and home in t he bosom of the Deity. The COMPASS, theref ore, as the Symbol of the Heavens, represents the spiritual, intellectual, and moral portion of this double na ture of humanity; and the SQUARE, as the Symbol of the Earth, it s material, sensual, and baser portion. \"Truth and Intelligence,\" said one of the An cient Indian Sects of Philosophers, \"are the Eter nal attributes of God, not of the individual S oul, which is susceptib le both of knowledge and ignorance, of pleasure an d pain; therefore God and "},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"the individual Soul are dist inct :\" and th is expression of the ancient Nyaya Philos ophers, in r egard to Truth, has been handed down to us through the long succession of ages, in the lessons of Freemasonry, wherein we read, that \"Truth is a Di vine Attribut e, and the foundation of every virtue.\" \"While embodied in matter,\" they said, \"the Soul is in a state of impris onment, and is under the influence of evil passions; but having, by intense study, arrived at the knowledge of the element s and principles of Nature, it attains unto t he place of THE ET ERNAL; in which state of happiness, its individuality does not cease.\" The vitality which animates the mortal frame, the Breath of Life of the Hebrew Genesis, the Hindu Philosophers in general held, perishes with it; but the Soul is divine, all emanation of the Spirit of God, but not a portion of that Spirit. For they compared it to the heat and light sent forth from the Sun, or to a ray of that light, which neit her lessens nor divides its own essence. However created, or invest ed with separate existence, the Soul, which is but th e creature of the Deity, cannot know the m ode of its creatio n, nor comprehend its own individuality. It c annot even comprehend how the being which it and t he body constitute, can feel pain, or see, or hear. It has pleased the Universal: Creator to set bounds to the scope of our human and finite reason, beyond which it cannot reach; and if we are capable of comprehending the mode and ma nner of the creation or generat ion of the Universe of things, He has been pleased to conceal it from us by an impenetrable veil, wh ile the words used to express the act have no other definite meaning than that He caused that Universe to commence to exist. It is enough for us to know , what Masonry teaches, that we are not all mort al; that t he Soul or Spirit, the intellectual and reasoning portion of ourself, is our Very Self, is not subject to decay and dissolution, but is simple and immaterial, survives the death of the body, and is capable of immo rtality; that it is also capable of improvement and advancement, of increase of knowledge of the things t hat are divine, of becoming wiser and better , and more and more worthy of immortality; and that to become so, and to help to improve and benefit others and all our race, is the "},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"noblest ambition and highest glory that we can entertain and attain unto, in this momentary and imperfect life. In every human being the Di vine and the Human are intermingled. In every one t here are the Reason and the Moral sense, the pa ssions that prompt to evil, and the sensual appetites. \"If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die,\" said Paul, writing to the Christians at Rome, \"but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.\" \"The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh,\" he said, writing to the Christians of Galatia, \"and these ar e contrary the one to the other, so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.\" \"That which I do, I do not willingly do,\" he wrote to the Romans, \"for what I wis h to do, that I do not do, but that which I hate I do. It is no mo re I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me . To will, is present with me; but how to perf orm that which is good, I find not. For, I do not do the good that I desire to do; and the evil that I do not wish to do, that I do do. I find then a law, that when I desire to do good, evil is present with me; fo r I delight in the law of God after the inward man, but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the la w of sin which is in my members. . . So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with t he flesh the law of sin.\" Life is a battle, and to fi ght that battle heroically and well is the great purpose of every man's existence, who is worthy and fit to li ve at all. To stem the strong currents of adversity, to advance in despite of all obstacles, to snatch vi ctory from the jealous grasp of fortune, to become a chief and a leader among men, to rise to rank and po wer by eloquence, courage, perseverance, study, ener gy, activity, discouraged by no reverses, impatie nt of no delays, deterred by no hazards; to win wealth, to subjugate men by our intellect, the very elem ents by our audacity, to succeed, to prosper, to thri ve;--thus it is, according to the general understanding, that one fights well the battle of life. Even to succeed in business by that boldness which halts for no risks, that audacity which stakes all upon hazardous c hances; by the shrewdness of the close dealer, the boldness of the unscrupulous operator, ever by the knav eries of the stock-board and the gold-room; to crawl up into place by disreputable "},{"pageNumber":566,"pageContent":"means or the votes of brutal ignorance,--these also are deemed to be among the gr eat successes of life. But that which is the greate st battle, and in which the truest honour and mo st real success ar e to be won, is that which our intellect and reason and moral sense, our spiritual natures, fi ght against our sensual appetites and evil passions, our earthly and material or animal nature. Therein on ly are the true glories of heroism to be won, t here only the successes that entitle us to triumphs. In every human life that battle is fought; and those who win elsewhere, often suff er ignominious defeat and disastrous rout, and discomfiture and shameful downfall in this encounter. You have heard more than one definiti on of Freemasonry. The truest and the most sign ificant you have yet to hear. It is taught to t he entered Apprentice, the Fellow-Craft, and the Master , and it is taught in every Degree through which you have advanced to this. It is a definition of what Freemasonry is, of what its purposes and its very essence and spir it are; and it has for every one of us the force and sanctity of a divine law, and imposes on every one of us a solemn obligation. It is symbolized and; taught, to the Apprentice as well as to you, by the COMPAS S and the SQUARE; upon which, as well as upon the Book of your Religion and the Book of the law of the Scottish Freemasonry, you have taken so many obligations. As a Knight, you have been taught it by the Swords, the symbo ls of HONOUR and DUTY, on which you have taken your vows: it was taught you by the BALANCE, the sym bol of all Equilibr ium, and by the CROSS, the symbol of devot edness and self-sacrifice; but all that these teach an d contain is taught and contained, for Entered Ap prentice, Knight, and Prince alike, by the Comp ass and the Square. For the Apprentice, the po ints of the Compass are beneath the Square. For the Fellow-Cra ft, one is above and one beneath. For the Master, both are dominant, and have rule, control, and empire over the symbol of the earthly and the material. FREEMASONRY is the subjugati on of the Human that is in man by the Divine; the Con quest of the Appetites and Passions by the Moral Sense and the Reason ; a continual "},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"effort, struggle, and warfar e of the Spiritual against the Material and Sensual. T hat victory, when it has been achieved and secured, and the conquer or may rest upon his shield and wear the well-earned laurels, is the true HOLY EMPIRE. To achieve it, the Mason mu st first attain a solid conviction, foun ded upon reason, th at he hath within him a spiritual natu re, a soul that is not to die when the body is dissolved, but is to continue to exist and to advance toward perfect ion through all the ages of eternity, and to see more and more clearly, as it draws nearer unto God, the Light of the Divine Presence. This the Philosophy of the Anci ent and Accepted Rite teaches him; and it encourages him to persevere by helping him to believe that his free will is entirely consistent with God's Omnipotenc e and Omniscience; that He is not only infinite in po wer, and of infini te wisdom, but of infinite mercy, and an infi nitely tender pity and love for the frail and imperfect creatures that He has made. Every Degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, from the first to the thirty-second , teaches by its ceremonial as well as by its instruction, that the noblest purpose of li fe and the highes t duty of a man are to strive incessantly and vigorously to win the mastery of everything, of that which in him is spiritual and divine , over that which is material and sensual; so that in him also, as in the Universe which God governs, Harmony and Beauty may be the result of a just equilibrium. You have been taugh t this in those Degrees, conferred in the Lodge of Perfec tion, which inculcate particularly the pr actical morality of Freemasonry. To be true, under whatever temp tation to be false; to be honest in all your dealings , even if great losses should be the consequence; to be char itable, when selfishness would pr ompt you to close your hand, and deprivation of luxury or comfort must follow the charitable act; to judge ju stly and impartially, even in your own case, when baser impulses prompt you to do an injustice in order th at you may be benefited or justified; to be toler ant, when passion prompts to intolerance and pers ecution; to do that which is right, when the wrong se ems to promise larger profit; and to wrong no man of anyt hing that is hi s, however easy it may seem so to enrich y ourself;--in all these things and others which you promis ed in those Degrees, your spiritual nature is taught and encouraged to assert its rightful dominion over your appetites and passions. "},{"pageNumber":568,"pageContent":"The philosophical Degrees hav e taught you the value of knowledge, the excellence of truth, the superiority of intellectual labour, the dignity and value of your soul, the worth of great an d noble thought s; and thus endeavoured to assist you to rise above the level of the animal appetites and pa ssions, the pursuits of greed and the miserable str uggles of ambition, and to find purer pleasure and nobler prizes and rewards in the acquisition of knowled ge, the enlargement of the intellect, the interpretati on of the sacr ed writing of God upon the great pages of the Book of Nature. And the Chivalric Degrees have led you on the same path, by showing you the excellence of generosity, clemency, forgiveness of injuries, magnanimity, contempt of dange r, and the paramo unt obligations of Duty and Honour. They have taught you to overcome the fear of death, to devote y ourself to the great cause of civil and religious Liberty, to be the Soldier of all that is just right, an d true; in the midst of pestilence to deserve your title of Knight Commander of the Temple, and nei ther there nor el sewhere to desert your post and flee dastard- like from the foe. In all this, you assert the superio rity and right to dominion of that in you which is sp iritual and divine. No base fear of danger or death, no sordid ambition s or pitiful greeds or base c onsiderations can tempt a true Scottish Knight to dishonour, and so make his intellect, his reason, his soul, the bond-s lave of his appetites, of his passions, of that whic h is material and animal, selfish and brutish in his nature. It is not possible to create a true and genuine Brotherhood upon any theory of the baseness of human nature: nor by a community of belief in abstract propositions as to the nature of the Deity, the number of His persons, or other t heorems of re ligious faith: nor by the establ ishment of a system of association simply for mutual relief, and by which, in consideration of certain payments re gularly made, each becomes entitled to a certain stipend in case of sickness, to attention then , and to the ceremonies of burial after death. There can be no genuine Br otherhood without mutual regard good opinion and est eem, mutual charity, and mutual allowance for faults and failings. It is those only who learn habitually to think better of each other, to look habitually fo r the good that is in each "},{"pageNumber":569,"pageContent":"other, and expect, allow fo r, and overlook, the evil, who can be Brethren one of the other, in any truse sense of the word. Those w ho gloat over the failings of one another, who think each other to be naturally base and low, of a nature in whic h the Evil predominates and excellence is not to be looked for, cannot be even friends, and much less Brethren. No one can have a right to think meanly of his race, unless he also thinks meanly of himself. If, from a single fault or error, he judges of the character of another, and takes the single act as evidence of the whole nature of the man and of t he whole course of his life, he ought to consent to be judged by the same rule, and to admit it to be right that others should thus uncharitably condemn hi mself. But such judgments will become impossible when he incessantly reminds himself that in every m an who lives there is an immortal Soul endeavouring to do that which is right and just; a Ray, howeve r small, and almost inappreciable, from the Gr eat Source of Light and Intelligence, which ever st ruggles upward amid all the impediments of sens e and the obstructions of the passions; and that in ever y man this ra y continually wages war against his ev il passions a nd his unruly appetites, or, if it has succumbed, is never wholly extinguished and ann ihilated. For he will then see that it is not victory, but th e struggle that deserves honour; since in this as in all else no man can always command success. Amid a clou d of errors, of failure, and shortcomings, he will look for th e struggling Soul, for that which is good in every one amid the evil, and, believing that each is bette r than from his acts and omissions he seems to be, and that God cares for him still, and pities him and love s him, he will feel that even the erring sinner is still his br other, still entitled to his sympathy, and bound to him by the indissoluble ties of fellowship. If there be nothing of the divine in ma n, what is he, after all, but a more intelligent animal? He hath no fault nor vice whic h some beast hath not; and therefore in his vices he is but a beas t of a higher order; and he hath hardly any moral e xcellence, perhaps none, which some animal hath not in as great a degree,-- even the more excellent of t hese, such as generosity, fidelity, and magnanimity. Bardesan, the Syrian Christia n, in his Book of the Laws "},{"pageNumber":570,"pageContent":"of Countries, says, of m en, that \"in the things belonging to t heir bodies, they ma intain their nature like animals, and in the th ings which belong to their minds, they do that which they wish, as being free and with power, and as the likeness of God\"- and Meliton, Bishop of Sardis, in his Or ation to Antoninus Caesar, says, \"Let Him, the ever- living God, be always present in thy, mind; for thy mind itself is His likeness, for it, too, is invisi ble and impalpable, and without form. . . As He exists forever, so thou also, when thou shalt have put off this which is visible and corruptible, shalt stand before Him fore ver, living and endowed with knowledge.\" As a matter far above our comprehension, and in the Hebrew Genesis the words that are used to express the origin of things are of uncertain meaning, and with equal propriety may be tr anslated by the word \"generated,\" \"produced,\" \"ma de,\" or \"created,\" we need not dispute nor deba te whether the So ul or Spirit of man be a ray that has emanate d or flowed fo rth from the Supreme Intelligen ce, or whether th e Infinite Power hath called each into existenc e from nothing, by a mere exertion of Its wi ll, and endowed it with immortality, and with intelligence like unto the Divine Intelligence: for, in either case it may be said that in man the Divine is united to the Human. Of this union the equilateral Triangle in scribed within the Square is a Symbol. We see the Soul, Pl ato said, as men see the statue of Glaucus, recovered from t he sea wherein it had lain many years--which viewin g, it was not easy, if possible, to discern what wa s its original nature, its limbs having been partly brok en and partly worn and by defacement changed, by the action of the waves, and shells, weeds, and pebbles a dhering to it, so that it more resembled some strange monster t han that which it was when it left its Divine Source. Even so, he said, we see the Soul, deformed by innumerable things that have done it harm, have mutilated and defaced it. But the Mason who hath the ROYAL SECRET can also with him argue, from beholding its love of wisdom, its tendency toward association with w hat is divine and immortal, its larger aspirations, it s struggles, though they may have ended in defeat, wi th the impediments and enthralments of the senses and the passions, that when it shall have been rescu ed from the material environments that now prov e too strong for it, and be freed from the defo rming and disfi guring accretions "},{"pageNumber":571,"pageContent":"that here adhere to it, it will again be seen in its true nature, and by degrees ascend by the mystic ladder of the Spheres, to its firs t home and place of origin. The ROYAL SECRET, of which y ou are Prince, if you are a true Adept, if kn owledge seems to you advisable, and Philosophy is, for you, radiant with a divine beauty, is that which the Sohar terms The Mystery of the BALANCE. It is the Secr et of the UNIVERSAL EQUILIBRIUM:-- -- Of that Equilibriu m in the Deity, between the Infinite Divine WISDOM and the Infinite Divine POWER, from which result the Stab ility of the Universe, the unchangeableness of the Divine Law, and the Principles of Truth, Justice, and Righ t which are a part of it; and the Supreme Obligation of the Divine Law upon all men, as superior to all ot her law, and forming a part of all the laws of men and nations. --Of that Equilibr ium also, between th e Infinite Divine JUSTICE and the Infinite Divi ne MERCY, the result of which is the Infinite Di vine EQUITY, and the Moral Harmony or Beauty of the Un iverse. By it the endurance of created and imperfect natu res in the presence of a Perfect Deity is made possi ble; and for Him, also, as for us, to love is better t han to hate, an d Forgiveness is wiser than Revenge or Punishment. --Of that Equili brium between NECESSITY and LIBERTY, between the action of the DIVINE Omnipotence and the Free-will of man, by which vices and base actions, and ungenerous thoughts and words are cr imes and wrongs, justly punished by the la w of cause and consequence, though nothing in the Universe c an happen or be done contrary to the will of God; and without which co-existence of Liberty and Necessity, of Free-will in the creature and Omnipotence in the Creator, there could be no religion, nor any law of right and wrong, or merit and demerit, nor any justice in human punishments or penal laws. --Of that Equilibr ium between Good and Evil, and Light and Darkness in the world, wh ich assures us that all is the work of the Infinite Wisdom and of an Infinite Love; and that t here is no rebellious demon of Evil, or Principle of Darkness co -existent and in eternal controversy with God, or t he Principle of Light and of Good: by attaining to the knowledge of which "},{"pageNumber":572,"pageContent":"equilibrium we can, throug h Faith, see that the existence of Evil, Sin, Su ffering, and Sorrow in the world, is consistent with the Infinite Goodness as well as with the Infinite Wisdom of the Almighty. Sympathy and Antipathy, Attr action and Repu lsion, each a Force of nature, are contra ries, in the souls of men and in the Universe of spheres a nd worlds; and from the action and opposition of each against the other, result Harmony, and that movement which is the Life of the Universe and the Soul alik e. They are not antagonists of each other. The force that repels a pla net from the Sun is no more an evil forc e, than that which attracts the Planet toward the c entral Luminary; for each is created and exerted by the De ity, and the result is the harmonious movement of the obedient Planets in their elliptic orbits, and the mathematical accuracy and unvarying regularity of their movements. --Of that Equili brium between Authority and Individual Action which constitutes Fr ee Government, by settling on immutable foundations Liber ty with Obedience to Law, Equality with Subj ection to Authorit y, and Fraternity with Subordination to the Wi sest and the Best: and of that Equilibrium between the Active Energy of the Will of the Present, expressed by the Vote of the People, and the Passive Stability and Permanence of the Will of the Past, expressed in c onstitutions of government, written or unwritt en, and in the laws and customs, gray with age and sanctified by time, as precedents and authority; which is represented by t he arch resting on the two columns, Jachin an d Boaz, that stand at the portals of the Temple builded by Wisdom, on one of which Masonry sets the celestial Gl obe, symbol of the spiritual part of our co mposite nature, and on the other the terrestrial Globe , symbol of the material part. --And, finally, of that Equilibrium, possible in ourselves, and which Masonr y incessantly labours to accomplish in its Initiate s, and demands of its Adepts and Princes (else unworthy of their titles), between the Spiritual and Divine a nd the Material and Human in man; between the Intellect, Reason, and Mo ral Sense on one side, and the Appetites and Passions on the other, from which result the Harmony and Beauty of a well-regulated life. Which possible Equilibrium proves to us that our "},{"pageNumber":573,"pageContent":"Appetites and Senses also are Forces given unto us by God, for purposes of good, and not the fr uits of the malignancy of a Devil, to be detested, mortified, and, if possible, rend ered inert and dead: that they are given us to be the mean s by which we shall be strengthened and incited to great and good deeds, and are to be wisely used, and no t abused; to be controlled and kept within due bounds by the Reason and the Moral Sense; to be made useful instruments and servants, and not permitted to be come the managers an d masters, using our intellect and reason as base instrument for their gratification. And this Equilibrium t eaches us, above all, to reverence ourselves as immo rtal souls, and to have respect and charity for others , who are even such as we are, partakers with us of the Divine Nature, lighted by a ray of the Divine Intelli gence, struggling, like us, toward the light; capable, like us, of progress upward toward perfection, and deserving to be loved and pitied, but never to be hate d nor despised; to be aided and encouraged in this life -struggle, a nd not to be abandoned nor left to wander in the darkness alone, still less to be trampled upo n in our own efforts to ascend. From the mutual ac tion and re-action of each of these pairs of opposites and cont raries results that which with them forms th e Triangle, to al l the Ancient Sages the expressive symbol of the Deity; as from Osiris and Isis, Har-oeri, the Master of Light and Li fe, and the Creative Word. At the angles of one stand, symbolically, the three columns that support the Lodge, itself a symbol of the Univ erse, Wisdom, Power, and Harmony or Beauty. One of these symbols, found on the Tracing-Board of the Apprent ice's Degree, teaches this last lesson of Freemasonry. It is the right-angled Triangle, representi ng man, as a unio n of the spiritual and material, of the divine arid human. The base, measured by the number 3, the number of the Triangle, represents the Deity and th e Divine; the perpendicular, measured by the number 4, the number of the Square, represents the Earth, the Material, and the Human; and the hypothenuse, measured by 5, represents that nature which is produced by the union of the Di vine and Human, the Soul and the Body; the squares, 9 and 16, of the base and perpendicular, adde d together, producing 25, the square root whereof is 5, the measure of the hypothenuse. "},{"pageNumber":574,"pageContent":"And as in each Triangle of Perfection, one is three and three are one, so man is one, though of a double nature; and he attains the purposes of his being only when the two natures that are in him are in just equilibrium; and his life is a success only when it too is a harmony, and beautiful, like the great Harmonies of God and the Universe. Such, my Brother, is the TRUE WORD of a Master Mason; such the true ROYAL SECRET, which makes possible, and shall at length make real, the HOLY EMPIRE of true Masonic Brotherhood.
