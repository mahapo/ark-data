Sensible historians usually refrain from writing accounts of very recent events because they realize that the source materials for such events, especially the indispensable official documents, are not available and that, even with the documentation which is available, it is very difficult for anyone to obtain the necessary perspective on the events of one's own mature life. But I must clearly not be a sensible or, at least, an ordinary historian, for, having covered, in an earlier book, the whole of human history in a mere 271 pages, I now use more than 1300 pages for the events of a single lifetime. There is a connection here. It will be evident to any attentive reader that I have devoted long years of study and much original research, even where adequate documentation is not available, but it should be equally evident that whatever value this present work has rests on its broad perspective. I have tried to remedy deficiencies of evidence by perspective, not only by projecting the patterns of past history into the present and the future but also by trying to place the events of the present in their total context by examining all the varied aspects of these events, not merely the political and economic, as is so frequently done, but by my efforts to bring into the picture the military, technological, social, and intellectual elements as well. The result of all this, I hope, is an interpretation of the present as well as the immediate past and the near future, which is free from the accepted cliches, slogans, and self-justifications which mar so much of \"contem- porary history.\" .Much of my adult life has been devoted to training undergraduates in techniques of historical analysis which will help them to free their understanding of history from the accepted categories and cognitive classifications of the society in which we live, since these, how- ever nccessarv they may be for our processes of thought and for the concepts and symbols needed for us to communicate about reality, never- theless do often serve as barriers which shield us from recognition of the underlying realities themselves. The present work is the result of such a n attempt to look at the real situations which lie beneath the conceptual ix"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"X   PREFACE   and verbal symbols. I feel that it does provide, as a consequence of this effort, a fresher, somewhat different, and (I hope) more satisfying ex- planation of how we arrived at the situation in which we now find our- selves. More than twenty years have gone into the writing of this work. Although most of it is based on the usual accounts of these events, some portions are based on fairly intensive personal research (including research among manuscript materials). These portions include the following: the nature and techniques of financial capitalism, the economic structure of France under the Third Republic, the social history of the United States, and the membership and activities of the English Establishment. On other subjects, my reading has been as wide as I could make it, and I have tried consistently to view all subjects from as wide and as varied points of view as I am capable. Although I regard myself, for purposes of classification, as a historian, I did a ^reat deal of study in political science at Harvard, have persisted in the private study of modern psychological theory for more than thirty years, and have been a member of the American Anthro- pological Association, the American Economic Association, and the Amer- ican Association for the Advancement of Science, as well as the American Historical Association for many years. Thus my chief justification for writing a lengthy work on contem- porary history, despite the necessarily restricted nature of the documenta- tion, must be based on my efforts to remedy this inevitable deficiency by using historical perspective to permit me to project the tendencies of the past into the present and even the future and my efforts to give this attempt a more solid basis by using all the evidence from a wide variety of academic disciplines. As a consequence of these efforts to use this broad, and perhaps com- plex, method, this book is almost inexcusably lengthy. For this I must apologize, with the excuse that I did not have time to make it shorter and that an admittedly tentative and interpretative work must necessarily be longer than a more definite or more dogmatic presentation. To those who find the length excessive, I can only sav that I omitted chapters, which were already written, on three topics: the agricultural history of Europe, the domestic history of France and Italy, and the intellectual history of the twentieth century in general. To do this I introduced enough on these subjects into other chapters. Although I project the interpretation into the near future on a number of occasions, the historical narrative ceases in 1964, not because the date of writing caught up with the march of historical events but because the period 1962-1964 seems to me to mark the end of an era of historical development and a period of pause before a quite different era with quite different problems begins. This change is evident in a number of obvious events, such as the fact that the leaders of all the major countries (except"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"PREFACE   XI   Red China and France) and of many lesser ones (such as Canada, India, West Germany, the Vatican, Brazil, and Israel) were changed in this period. Much more important is the fact that the Cold War, which cul- minated in the Cuban crisis of October 1962, began to dwindle toward its end during the next two vears, a process which was evident in a number of events, such as the rapid replacement of the Cold War by \"Competitive Coexistence\"; the disintegration of the two superblocs which had faced each other during the Cold War; the rise of neutralism, both within the superblocs and in the buffer fringe of third-bloc powers be- tween them; the swamping of the United Nations General Assembly under a flood of newly independent, sometimes microscopic, pseudopowers; the growing parallelism of the Soviet Union and the United States; and the growing emphasis in all parts of the world on problems of living standards, of social maladjustments, and of mental health, replacing the previous emphasis on armaments, nuclear tensions, and heavy industrialization. At such a period, when one era seems to be ending and a different, if yet indistinct era appearing, it seemed to me as good a time as any to evaluate the past and to seek some explanation of how we arrived where we are. In any preface such as this, it is customary to conclude with acknowl- edgment of personal obligations. My sense of these is so broad that I find it invidious to single out some and to omit others. But four must be men- tioned. Much of this book was typed, in her usual faultless way, by my wife. This was done originally and in revised versions, in spite of the constant distractions of her domestic obligations, of her own professional career in a different university, and of her own writing and publication. For her cheerful assumption of this great burden, I am very grateful. Similarly, I am grateful to the patience, enthusiasm, and amazingly wide knowledge of my editor at The Macmillan Company, Peter V. Ritner. I wish to express my gratitude to the University Grants Committee of Georgetown University, which twice provided funds for summer research. And, finally, I must say a word of thanks to my students over many years who forced me to keep up with the rapidly changing customs and outlook of our young people and sometimes also compelled me to recognize that my way of looking at the world is not necessarily the only way, or even the best way, to look at it. Many of these students, past, present, and future, are included in the dedication of this book.

And surelv never before have these myriads of questioners asked their question in such dolorous tones or rephrased their question in such despairing words: \"Can man survive?\" Even on a less cosmic basis, questioners appear on all sides, seeking \"meaning\" or \"identity,'^ or even, on the most narrowly egocentric basis, \"trying to find myself.\" One of these persistent questions is typical of the twentieth century rather than of earlier times: Can our way of life survive? Is our civiliza- tion doomed to vanish, as did that of the Incas, the Sumerians, and the Romans? From Giovanni Battista Vico in the early eighteenth century to Oswald Spengler in the early twentieth century and Arnold J. Toynbee in our own day, men have been puzzling over the problem whether civili- zations have a'life cycle and follow a similar pattern of change. From this discussion has emerged a fairly general agreement that men live in sepa- rately organized societies, each with its own distinct culture; that some of these societies, having writing and city life, exist on a higher level of culture than the rest, and should be called by the different term \"civili- zations\"; and that these civilizations tend to pass through a common pat- tern of experience. From these studies it would seem that civilizations pass through a process of evolution which can be analyzed briefly as follows: each civili- zation is born in some inexplicable fashion and, after a slow start, enters a period of vigorous expansion, increasing its size and power, both in- ternally and at the expense of its neighbors, until gradually a crisis of organization appears. When this crisis has passed and the civilization has been reorganized, it seems somewhat different. Its vigor and morale have weakened. It becomes stabilized and eventually stagnant. After a Golden Age of peace and prosperity, internal crises again arise. At this point there appears, for the first time, a moral and physical weakness which raises, also for the first time, questions about the civilization's ability to defend itself against external enemies.

When we come to applv this process, even in this rather vague form, to our own civilization, Western Civilization, we can see that certain modifications are needed. Like other civilizations, our civilization began with a period of mixture of cultural elements from other societies, formed these elements into a culture distinctly its own, began to expand with growing rapidity as others had done, and passed from this period of expansion into a period of crisis. But at that point the pattern changed. In more than a dozen other civilizations the Age of Expansion was fol- lowed by an Age of Crisis, and this, in turn, by a period of Universal Empire in which a single political unit ruled the whole extent of the civilization. Western Civilization, on the contrary, did not pass from the Age of Crisis to the Age of Universal Empire, but instead was able to reform itself and entered upon a new period of expansion. Aloreover, Western Civilization did this not once, but several times. It was thL> ability to reform or reorganize itself again and again which made West- ern Civilization the dominant factor in the world at the beginning of the twentieth century. As we look at the three ages forming the central portion of the life evele of a civilization, we can see a common pattern. The Age of Ex- pansion is generally marked bv four kinds of expansion: (i) of popula- tion, (2) of geographic area, (3) of production, and (4) of knowledge. The expansion of production and the expansion of knowledge give rise to the expansion of population, and the three of these together give rise to the expansion of geographic extent. This geographic expansion is of some importance because it gives the civilization a kind of nuclear structure made up of an older core area (which had existed as part of the civiliza- tion even before the period of expansion) and a newer peripheral area (which became part of the civilization only in the period of expansion and later). If we wish, we can make, as an additional refinement, a third, semiperipheral area between the core area and the fully peripheral area. These various areas are readily discernible in various civilizations of the past, and have plaved a vital role in historic change in these civilizations. In Mesopotamian Civilization (6000 B.c-300 B.C.) the core area was the lower valley of .Mesopotamia; the semiperipheral area was the middle and upper valley, while the peripheral area included the highlands surround- ing this valley, and more remote areas like Iran, Syria, and even Anatolia. The core area of Cretan Civilization (3500 B.C.-I 100 B.C.) was the island of Crete, while the peripheral area included the Aegean islands and the Balkan coasts. In Classical Civilization the core area was the shores of the Aegean Sea; the semiperipheral area was the rest of the northern portion of the eastern Mediterranean Sea, while the peripheral area covered the"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION IN ITS WORLD SETTING 5 rest of the .Mediterranean shores and ultimately Spain, North Africa, and Gaul. In Canaanite Civilization (2200 B.C.-IOO B.C.) the core area was the Levant, while the peripheral area was in the western Mediterranean at Tunis, western Sicilv, and eastern Spain. The core area of Western Civilization (A.D. 400 to some time in the future) has been the northern half of Italy, France, the extreme western part of Germany, and Eng- land; the semiperipheral area has been central, eastern, and southern Europe and the Iberian peninsula, while the peripheral areas have included North and South America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and some other areas. This distinction of at least two geographic areas in each civilization is of major importance. The process of expansion, which begins in the core area, also begins to slow up in the core at a time when the peripheral area is still expanding. In consequence, by the latter part of the Age of Ex- pansion, the peripheral areas of a civilization tend to become wealthier and more powerful than the core area. Another way of saying this is that the core passes from the Age of Expansion to the Age of Conflict before the peripherv does. Eventually, in most civilizations the rate of expansion begins to decline everywhere. It is this decline in the rate of expansion of a civilization which marks its passage from the Age of Expansion to the Age of Conflict. This latter ] s the most complex, most interesting, and most critical of all the periods or the life cycle of a civilization. It is marked by four chief characteris- tics: (a) it is a period of declining rate of expansion; (b) it is a period of growing tensions and class conflicts; (c) it is a period of increasingly fre- quent and increasingly violent imperialist wars; and (d) it is a period of growing irrationality, pessimism, superstitions, and otherworldliness. All these phenomena appear in the core area of a civilization before they appear in more peripheral portions of the society. The decreasing rate of expansion of the Age of Conflict gives rise to the other characteristics of the age, in part at least. After the long years of the Age of Expansion, people's minds and their social organizations are adjusted to expansion, and it is a very difficult thing to readjust these to a decreasing rate of expansion. Social classes and political units within the civilization try to compensate for the slowing of expansion through normal growth by the use of violence against other social classes or against other political units. From this come class struggles and imperialist wars. The outcomes of these struggles within the civilization are not of vital significance for the future of the civilization itself. What would be of such significance would be the reorganization of the structure of the civilization so that the process of normal growth would be resumed. Because such a reorganization requires the removal of the causes of the civilization's decline, the triumph of one social class over another or of one political unit over another, within the civilization, will not usually"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"6   TRAGEDY AND HOPE have any major influence on the causes of the decline, and will not (except by accident) result in such a reorganization of structure as will give rise to a new period of expansion. Indeed, the class struggles and imperialist wars of the Age of Conflict will probablv serve to increase the speed of the civilization's decline because they dissipate capital and divert wealth and energies from productive to nonproductive activities. In most civilizations the long-drawn agonv of the Age of Conflict finally ends in a new period, the Age of the Universal Empire. As a result of the imperialist wars of the Age of Conflict, the number of political units in the civilization are reduced by conquest. Eventually one emerges triumphant. When this occurs we have one political unit for the whole civilization. Just at the core area passes from the Age of Expansion to the Age of Conflict earlier than the peripheral areas, sometimes the core area is conquered bv a single state before the whole civilization is con- quered by the Universal Empire. When this occurs the core empire is generally a semiperipheral state, while the Universal Empire is generally a peripheral state. Thus, Mesopotamia's core was conquered by semi- peripheral Babylonia about 1700 B.C., while the whole of Mesopotamian civilization was conquered by more peripheral Assyria about 725 B.C. (replaced by fully peripheral Persia about 525 B.C.). In Classical Civiliza- tion the core area was conquered by semiperipheral Macedonia about 336 B.C, while the whole civilization was conquered by peripheral Rome about 146 B.C. In other civilizations the Universal Empire has consistently been a peripheral state even when there was no earlier conquest of the core area by a semiperipheral state. In Mayan Civilization (1000 B.C- A.D. 1550) the core area was apparently in Yucatan and Guatemala, but the Universal Empire of the Aztecs centered in the peripheral highlands of central Mexico. In Andean Civilization (1500 B.C.-A.D. 1600) the core areas were on the lower slopes and valleys of the central and north- ern Andes, but the Universal Empire of the Incas centered in the highest Andes, a peripheral area. The Canaanite Civilization (2200 B.C.-146 B.C.) had its core area in the Levant, but its Universal Empire, the Punic Em- pire, centered at Carthage in the western Mediterranean. If we turn to the Far East we see no less than three civilizations. Of these the earliest, Sink Gvilization, rose in the valley of the Yellow River after 2000 B.C, culminated in the Chin and Han empires after 200 B.C, and was largely destroyed by Ural-Altaic invaders after A.D. 400. From this Sinic Civiliza- tion, in the same way in which Classical Civilization emerged from Cretan Civilization or Western Civilization emerged from Classical Civilization, there emerged two other civilizations: (a) Chinese Civilization, which be- gan about A.D. 400, culminated in the Manchu Empire after 1644, and was disrupted by European invaders in the period 1700-1930, and (b) Japa- nese Civilization, which began about the time of Christ, culminated in the Tokugawa Empire after 1600, and may have been completely disrupted"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION IN ITS WORLD SETTING J by invaders from Western Civilization in the century following 1853. In India, as in China, two civilizations have followed one another. Al- though we know relatively little about the earlier of the two, the later (as in China) culminated in a Universal Empire ruled by an alien and peripheral people. Indie Civilization, which began about 3500 B.C., was destroyed by Aryan invaders about 1700 B.C Hindu Civilization, which emerged from Indie Civilization about 1700 B.C., culminated in the Mogul Empire and was destroyed by invaders from Western Civilization in the period 1500-1900. Turning to the extremely complicated area of the Near East, we can see a similar pattern. Islamic Civilization, which began about A.D. 500, culminated in the Ottoman Empire in the period 1300-1600 and has been in the process of being destroyed by invaders from Western Civilization since about 1750. Expressed in this way, these patterns in the life cycles of various civi- lizations may seem confused. But if we tabulate them, the pattern emerges with some simplicity. From this table a most extraordinary fact emerges. Of approximately twenty civilizations which have existed in all of human history, we have listed sixteen. Of these sixteen, twelve, possibly fourteen, are already dead <>r dying, their cultures destroyed by outsiders able to come in with suf- ficient power to disrupt the civilization, destroy its established modes of thought and action, and eventually wipe it out.

When we consider the untold numbers of other societies, simpler than civilizations, which Western Civilization has de- stroyed or is now destroying, societies such as the Hottentots, the Iroquois, the Tasmanians, the Navahos, the Caribs, and countless others, the full frightening power of Western Civilization becomes obvious. One cause, although by no means the chief cause, of the ability of Western Civilization to destroy other cultures rests on the fact that it has been expanding for a long time. This fact, in turn, rests on another condition to which we have already alluded, the fact that Western Civili- zation has passed through three periods of expansion, has entered into an Age of Conflict three times, each time has had its core area conquered almost completely by a single political unit, but has failed to go on to the Age of the Universal Empire because from the confusion of the Age of Conflict there emerged each time a new organization of society capable of expanding by its own organizational powers, with the result that the four phenomena characteristic of the Age of Conflict (decreas- ing rate of expansion, class conflicts, imperialist wars, irrationality) were gradually replaced once again by the four kinds of expansion typical of an Age of Expansion (demographic, geographic, production, knowl- edge). From a narrowly technical point of view, this shift from an Age of Conflict to an Age of Expansion is marked by a resumption of the investment of capital and the accumulation of capital on a large scale, just as the earlier shift from the Age of Expansion to the Age of Con- flict was marked by a decreasing rate of investment and eventually by a decreasing rate of accumulation of capital. Western Civilization began, as all civilizations do, in a period of cul- tural mixture. In this particular case it was a mixture resulting from the barbarian invasions which destroyed Classical Civilization in the period 350-700. By creating a new culture from the various elements offered from the barbarian tribes, the Roman world, the Saracen world, and above all the Jewish world (Christianity), Western Civilization became a new societv. This society became a civilization when it became organized, in the period 700-970, so that there was accumulation of capital and the be- ginnings of the investment of this capital in new methods of produc- tion. These new methods are associated with a change from infantry forces to mounted warriors in defense, from manpower (and thus slav- ery) to animal power in energy use, from the scratch plow and two- field, fallow agricultural technology of Mediterranean Europe to the eight-oxen, gang plow and three-field system of the Germanic peoples, and from the centralized, state-centered political orientation of the Roman world to the decentralized, private-power feudal network of the medieval world. In the new system a small number of men, equipped and trained to fight, received dues and services from the overwhelming"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION IN ITS WORLD SETTING 9 majority of men who were expected to till the soil. From this inequitable but effective defensive system emerged an inequitable distribution of political power and, in turn, an inequitable distribution of the social eco- nomic income. This, in time, resulted in an accumulation of capital, which, by giving rise to demand for luxury goods of remote origin, began to shift the whole economic emphasis of the society from its ear- lier organization in self-sufficient agrarian units (manors) to commer- cial interchange, economic specialization, and, by the thirteenth century, to an entirely new pattern of society with towns, a bourgeois class, spreading literacy, growing freedom of alternative social choices, and new, often disturbing, thoughts. From all this came the first period of expansion of Western Civiliza- tion, covering the years 970-1270. At the end of this period, the or- ganization of society was becoming a petrified collection of vested interests, investment was decreasing, and the rate of expansion was begin- ning to fall. Accordingly, Western Civilization, for the first time, en- tered upon the Age of Conflict. This period, the time of the Hundred Years' War, the Black Death, the great heresies, and severe class conflicts, lasted from about 1270 to 1420. By the end of it, efforts were arising from England and Burgundy to conquer the core of Western Civiliza- tion. But, just at that moment, a new Age of Expansion, using a new organization of society which circumvented the old vested interests of the feudal-manorial system, began. This new Age of Expansion, frequently called the period of commer- cial capitalism, lasted from about 1440 to about 1680. The real impetus to economic expansion during the period came from efforts to obtain profits by the interchange of goods, especially semiluxury or luxury goods, over long distances. In time, this system of commercial capitalism became petrified into a structure of vested interests in which profits were sought by imposing restrictions on the production or interchange of goods rather than by encouraging these activities. This new vested- interest structure, usually called mercantilism, became such a burden on economic activities that the rate of expansion of economic life declined and even gave rise to a period of economic decline in the decades imme- diately following 1690. The class struggles and imperialist wars en- gendered by this Age of Conflict are sometimes called the Second Hun- dred Years' War. The wars continued until 1815, and the class struggles even later. As a result of the former, France by 1810 had conquered most of the core of Western Civilization. But here, just as had occurred in 1420 when England had also conquered part of the core of the civilization to- ward the latter portion of an Age of Conflict, the victory was made mean- ingless because a new period of expansion began. Just as commercial capitalism had circumvented the petrified institution of the feudal- manorial system (chivalry) after 1440, so industrial capitalism circum-"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"IO   TRAGEDY AND HOPE vented the petrified institution of commercial capitalism (mercantilism) after 1810. The new Age of Expansion which made Napoleon's military-political victory of 1810 impossible to maintain had begun in England long before. It appeared as the Agricultural Revolution about 1725 and as the Indus- trial Revolution about 1775, but it did not get started as a great burst of expansion until after 1820. Once started, it moved forward with an impetus such as the world had never seen before, and it looked as if Western Civilization might cover the whole globe. The dates of this third Age of Expansion might be fixed at 1770-1929, following upon the second Age of Conflict of 1690-1815. The social organization which was at the center of this new development might be called \"industrial capital- ism.\" In the course of the last decade of the nineteenth centurv, it began to become a structure of vested interests to which we might give the name \"monopoly capitalism.\" As earlv, perhaps, as 1890, certain aspects of a new Age of Conflict, the third in Western Civilization, began to appear, especially in the core area, with a revival of imperialism, of class struggle, of violent warfare, and of irrationalities. By 1930 it was clear that Western Civilization was again in an Age of Conflict; by 1942 a semiperipheral state, Germany, had conquered much of the core of the civilization. That effort was defeated by calling into the fray a peripheral state (the United States) and another, outside civilization (the Soviet society). It is not yet clear whether Western Civilization will continue along the path marked by so many earlier civi- lizations, or whether it will be able to reorganize itself sufficiently to enter upon a new, fourth, Age of Expansion. If the former occurs, this Age of Conflict will undoubtedly continue with the fourfold characteris- tics of class struggle, war, irrationality, and declining progress. In this case, we shall undoubtedly get a Universal Empire in which the United States will rule most of Western Civilization. This will be followed, as in other civilizations, by a period of decay and ultimately, as the civiliza- tion grows weaker, by invasions and the total destruction of W'estern culture. On the other hand, if Western Civilization is able to reorganize itself and enters upon a fourth Age of Expansion, the ability of Western Civilization to survive and go on to increasing prosperity and power will be bright. Leaving aside this hypothetical future, it would appear thus that Western Civilization, in approximately fifteen hundred years, has passed through eight periods, thus: 1. Mixture, 350-700 2. Gestation, 700-970 3A. First Expansion, 970-1270 4A. First Conflict, 1270-1440 Core Empire: England, 1420"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION IN ITS WORLD SETTING II 3B.

Universal Empire (the United States) 6. Decay 7. Invasion (end of the civilization) From the list of civilizations previouslv given, it becomes somewhat easier to see how Western Civilization was able to destroy (or is still destroying) the cultures of six other civilizations. In each of these six cases the victim civilization had already passed the period of Universal Empire and was deep in the Age of Decay. In such a situation Western Civilization played a role as invader similar to that played by the Ger- manic tribes in Classical Civilization, by the Dorians in Cretan Civiliza- tion, by the Greeks in .Mesopotamian or Egyptian Civilization, by the Romans in Canaanite Civilization, or by the Ayrans in Indie Civilization. I he Westerners who burst in upon the Aztecs in 1519, on the Incas in • 534' on the Mogul Empire in the eighteenth century, on the Manchu empire after 1790, on the Ottoman Empire after 1774, and on the lokugawa Empire after 1853 were performing the same role as the Visigoths and the other barbarian tribes to the Roman Empire after 377. In each case, the results of the collision of two civilizations, one in the Age of Expansion and the other in the Age of Decay, was a foregone conclusion. Expansion would destroy Decay. In the course of its various expansions Western Civilization has col- lided with only one civilization which was not already in the stage of decay. This exception was its half-brother, so to speak, the civilization now represented by the Soviet Empire. It is not clear what stage this Orthodox\" Civilization is in, but it clearlv is not in its stage of decay. It would appear that Orthodox Civilization began as a period of mixture (500-1300) and is now in its second period of expansion. The first period of expansion, covering 1500-1900, had just begun to change into an Age of Conflict (1900-1920) when the vested interests of the society were wiped away by the defeat at the hands of Germany in 1917 and replaced by a new organization of society which gave rise to a second Age of Expansion (since 1921). During much of the last four hundred"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"12   TRAGEDY AND HOPE years culminating in the twentieth century, the fringes of Asia have been occupied by a semicircle of old dying civilizations (Islamic, Hindu, Chinese, Japanese). These have been under pressure from Western Civili- zation coming in from the oceans and from Orthodox Civilization pushing outward from the heart of the Eurasian land mass. The Oceanic pres- sure began with Vasco da Gama in India in 1498, culminated aboard the battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay in 1945, and still continued with the Anglo-French attack on Suez in 1956. The Russian pressure from the continental heartland was applied to the inner frontiers of China, Iran, and Turkey from the seventeenth century to the present. Much of the world's history in the twentieth century has arisen from the interactions of these three factors (the continental heartland of Russian power, the shattered cultures of the Buffer Fringe of Asia, and the oceanic powers of Western Civilization). Cultural Diffusion in Western Civilization We have said that the culture of a civilization is created in its core area originally and moves outward into peripheral areas which thus be- come part of the civilization. This movement of cultural elements is called \"diffusion\" by students of the subject. It is noteworthy that mate- rial elements of a culture, such as tools, weapons, vehicles, and such, dif- fuse more readily and thus more rapidly than do the nonmaterial elements such as ideas, art forms, religious outlook, or patterns of social behavior. For this reason the peripheral portions of a civilization (such as Assyria in Mesopotamian Civilization, Rome or Spain in Classical Civilization, and the United States or Australia in Western Civilization) tend to have a somewhat cruder and more material culture than the core area of the same civilization. Material elements of a culture also diffuse beyond the boundaries of a civilization into other societies, and do so much more readily than the nonmaterial elements of the culture. For this reason the nonmaterial and spiritual elements of a culture are what give it its distinctive character rather than its tools and weapons which can be so easily exported to entirely different societies. Thus, the distinctive character of Western Civilization rests on its Christian heritage, its scientific outlook, its humanitarian elements, and its distinctive point of view in regard to the rights of the individual and respect for women rather than in such mate- rial things as firearms, tractors, plumbing fixtures, or skyscrapers, all of which are exportable commodities."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION IN ITS WORLD SETTING 13 The export of material elements in a culture, across its peripheral areas and bevond, to the peoples of totally different societies has strange re- sults. As elements of material culture move from core to periphery inside a civilization, thev tend, in the long run, to strengthen the periphery at the expense of rhe core because the core is more hampered in the use of material innovations bv the strength of past vested interests and be- cause the core devotes a much greater part of its wealth and energy to nonmaterial culture. Thus, such aspects of the Industrial Revolution as automobiles and radios are European rather than American inventions, but have been developed and utilized to a far greater extent in America because this area was not hampered in their use by surviving elements of feudalism, of church domination, of rigid class distinctions (for ex- ample, in education), or by widespread attention to music, poetry, art, or religion such as we find in Europe. A similar contrast can be seen in Classical Civilization between Greek and Roman or in Mesopotamian Civi- lization between Sumerian and Assyrian or in Mayan Civilization be- tween Mayan and Aztec. The diffusion of culture elements beyond the boundaries of one so- ciety into the culture of another society presents quite a different case. The boundaries between societies present relatively little hindrance to the diffusion of material elements, and relatively greater hindrance to the diffusion of nonmaterial elements. Indeed, it is this fact which determines the boundary of the society, for, if the nonmaterial elements also diffused, the new area into which they flowed would be a peripheral portion of the old society rather than a part of a quite different society. The diffusion of material elements from one society to another has a complex effect on the importing society. In the short run it is usually benefited by the importation, but in the long run it is frequently dis- organized and weakened. When white men first came to North America, material elements from Western Civilization spread rapidly among the different Indian tribes. The Plains Indians, for example, were weak and impoverished before 1543, but in that year the horse began to diffuse northward from the Spaniards in Mexico. Within a century the Plains Indians were raised to a much higher standard of living (because of ability to hunt buffalo from horseback) and were immensely strength- ened in their ability to resist Americans coming westward across the continent. In the meantime, the trans-Appalachian Indians who had been very powerful in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries began to teceive firearms, steel traps, measles, and eventually whiskey from the French and later the English by way of the St. Lawrence. These greatly weakened the woods Indians of the trans-Appalachian area and ultimately Weakened the Plains Indians of the trans-Mississippi area, because measles and whiskey were devastating and demoralizing and because the use of traps and guns by certain tribes made them dependent on whites for sup-"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"'4   TRAGEDY AND HOPE plies at the same time that they allowed them to put great physical pres- sure on the more remote tribes which had not yet received guns or traps. Any united front of reds against whites was impossible, and the Indians were disrupted, demoralized, and destroyed. In general, importation of an element of material culture from one society to another is helpful to the importing society in the long run only if it is (a) productive, (b) can be made within the society itself, and (c) can be fitted into the nonmaterial culture of the importing society without demoralizing it. The destructive impact of Western Civilization upon so many other societies rests on its ability to demoralize their ideological and spiritual culture as much as its ability to destroy them in a material sense with firearms. When one society is destroyed by the impact of another society, the people are left in a debris of cultural elements derived from their own shattered culture as well as from the invading culture. These elements generally provide the instruments for fulfilling the material needs of these people, but they cannot be organized into a functioning society be- cause of the lack of an ideology and spiritual cohesive. Such people either perish or are incorporated as individuals and small groups into some other culture, whose ideology they adopt for themselves and, above all, for their children. In some cases, however, the people left with the debris of a shattered culture are able to reintegrate the cultural elements into a new society and a new culture. They are able to do this because they obtain a new nonmaterial culture and thus a new idology and morale which serve as a cohesive for the scattered elements of past culture they have at hand. Such a new ideology may be imported or may be indigenous, but in either case it becomes sufficiently integrated with the necessary elements of material culture to form a functioning whole and thus a new society. It is by some such process as this that all new societies, and thus all new civilizations, have been born. In this way, Classical Civilization was born from the wreckage of Cretan Civi- lization in the period 1150 B.C.—900 B.C., and Western Civilization was born from the wreckage of Classical Civilization in the period A.D. 350—700. It is possible that new civilizations may be born in the debris from the civilizations wrecked by Western Civilization on the fringes of Asia. In this wreckage is debris from Islamic, Hindu, Chinese, and Japanese civilizations. It would appear at the present time that new civilizations may be in the throes of birth in Japan, possibly in China, less likely in India, and dubiously in Turkey or Indonesia. The birth of a powerful civilization at any or several of these points would be of primary sig- nificance in world history, since it would serve as a counterbalance to the expansion of Soviet Civilization on the land mass of Eurasia. Turning from a hypothetical future to a historical past, we can trace the diffusion of cultural elements within Western Civilization from its"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION IN ITS WORLD SETTING 15 core area across peripheral areas and outward to other societies. Some of these elements are sufficiently important to command a more detailed examination.     ,     Among the elements of the Western tradition which have diffused only very slowly or not at all are a closely related nexus of ideas at the basis of Western ideology. These include Christianity, the scientific out- look, humanitarianism, and the idea of the unique value and rights of the individual. But from this nexus of ideas have sprung a number of elements of material culture of which the most noteworthy are asso- ciated with technology. These have diffused readily, even to other societies. This ability of Western technology to emigrate and the in- ability of the scientific outlook, with which such technology is fairly closely associated, to do so have created an anomalous situation: societies such as Soviet Russia which have, because of lack of the tradition of scientific method, shown little inventiveness in technology are neverthe- less able to threaten Western Civilization by the use, on a gig ant:ic s^- ' of a technology almost entirely imported from Western Civilization. A similar situation may well develop in any new civilizations which come into existence on the fringes of Asia. The most important parts of Western technology can be listed under four headings: 1. Ability to kill: development of weapons 2. Ability to preserve life: development of sanitation and medical services 3. Ability to produce both food and industrial goods 4. Improvements in transportation and communications We have already spoken of the diffusion of Western firearms. The impact which these\" have had on peripheral areas and other societies, from Cortez's invasion of Mexico in 1519 to the use of the first atom bomb on Japan in 1945, is obvious. Less obvious, but in the long run of much greater significance, is the ability of Western Civilization to conquer disease and to postpone deatli by sanitation and medical advances. These advances began in the core of Western Civilization before 1500 but have exercised their full impact only since about 1750 with the advent of vaccination, the conquest of plague, and the steady advance in saving lives through the discovery of antisepsis in the nineteenth century and of the antibiotics in the twentieth century. These discoveries and techniques have diffused outward from the core of Western Civilization and have resulted in a fall in the death rate in western Europe and America almost immediately, in southern Europe and eastern Europe somewhat later, and in Asia only in the period since 1900. The world-shaking significance of this diffusion will be discussed in a moment."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"l6   TRAGEDY AND HOPE Western Civilization's conquest of the techniques of production are so outstanding that thev have been honored by the term \"revolution\" in all history books concerned with the subject. The conquest of the problem of producing food, known as the Agricultural Revolution, began in England as long ago as the early eighteenth century, say about 1725. The conquest of the problem of producing manufactured goods, known as the Industrial Revolution, also began in England, about fifty years after the Agricultural Revolution, say about 1775. The relationship of these two '\"revolutions\" to each other and to the \"revolution\" in sanitation and public health and the differing rates at which these three \"revolutions\" diffused is of the greatest importance for understanding both the history of Western Civilization and its impact on other so- cieties. Agricultural activities, which provide the chief food supply of all civilizations, drain the nutritive elements from the soil. Unless these elements are replaced, the productivity of the soil will be reduced to a dangerously low level. In the medieval and early modern period of European history, these nutritive elements, especially nitrogen, were replaced through the action of the weather by leaving the land fallow- either one year in three or even every second year. This had the effect of reducing the arable land by half or one-third. The Agricultural Revo- lution was an immense step forward, since it replaced the year of fallow- ing with a leguminous crop whose roots increased the supply of nitrogen in the soil by capturing this gas from the air and fixing it in the soil in a form usable bv plant life. Since the leguminous crop which re- placed the fallow r year of the older agricultural cycle was generally a crop like alfalfa, clover, or sainfoin which provided feed for cattle, this Agricultural Revolution not only increased the nitrogen content of the soil for subsequent crops of grain but also increased the number and quality of farm animals, thus increasing the supply of meat and animal products for food, and also increasing the fertility of the soil by increasing the supply of animal manure for fertilizers. The net result of the whole Agricultural Revolution was an increase in both the quantity and the quality of food. Fewer men were able to produce so much more food that many men were released from the burden of pro- ducing it and could devote their attention to other activities, such as government, education, science, or business. It has been said that in 1700 the agricultural labor of twenty persons was required in order to produce enough food for twenty-one persons, while in some areas, by 1900, three persons could produce enough food for twenty-one persons, thus releasing seventeen persons for nonagricultural activities. This Agricultural Revolution which began in England before 1725 reached France after 1800, but did not reach Germany or northern Italy until after 1830. As late as 1900 it had hardly spread at all into Spain,"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION IN ITS WORLD SETTING 17 southern Italy and Sicily, the Balkans, or eastern Europe generally. In Germany, about 1840, this Agricultural Revolution was given a new boost forward' by the introduction of the use of chemical fertilizers, and re- ceived another boost in the United States after 1880 by the introduction of farm machinery which reduced the need for human labor. These same two areas, with contributions from some other countries, gave another considerable boost to agricultural output after 1900 by the introduction of new seeds and better crops through seed selection and hybridization. These great agricultural advances after 1725 made possible the ad- vances in industrial production after 1775 by providing the food and thus the labor for the growth of the factory system and the rise of in- dustrial cities. Improvements in sanitation and medical services after 1775 contributed to the same end by reducing the death rate and by making it possible for large numbers of persons to live in cities without the danger of epidemics. The \"Transportation Revolution\" also contributed its share to making the modern world. This contribution began, slowly enough, about 1750, with the construction of canals and the building of turnpikes by the new methods of road construction devised by John L. McAdam (\"macadam- ized\" roads). Coal came by canal and food by the new roads to the new industrial cities after 1800. After 1825 both were greatly improved by the growth of a network of railroads, while communications were speeded by the use of the telegraph (after 1837) and the cable (after 1850). This \"conquest of distance\" was unbelievably accelerated in the twentieth century by the use of internal-combustion engines in automobiles, air- craft, and ships and by the advent of telephones and radio communica- tions. The chief result of this tremendous speeding up of communica- tions and transportation was that all parts of the world were brought closer together, and the impact of European culture on the non-European world was greatly intensified. This impact was made even more over- whelming by the fact that the Transportation Revolution spread outward from Europe extremely rapidly, diffusing almost as rapidly as the spread of European weapons,' somewhat more rapidly than the spread of Euro- pean sanitation and medical services, and much more rapidly than the spread of European industrialism, European agricultural techniques, or European ideology. As we shall see in a moment, many of the problems which the world faced at the middle of the twentieth century were rooted in the fact that these different aspects of the European way of life spread outward into the non-European world at such different speeds that the non-European world obtained them in an entirely different order from that in which Europe had obtained them. One example of this difference can be seen in the fact that in Europe the Industrial Revolution generally took place before the Transportation Revolution, but in the non-European world this sequence was reversed."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"l8   TRAGEDY AND HOPE This means that Europe was able to produce its own iron, steel, and cop- per to build its own railroads and telegraph wires, but the non-European world could construct these things only by obtaining the necessary in- dustrial materials from Europe and thus becoming the debtor of Europe. The speed with which the Transportation Revolution spread out from Europe can be seen in the fact that in Europe the railroad began before 1830, the telegraph before 1840, the automobile about 1890, and the wireless about 1900. The transcontinental railroad in the United States opened in 1869; by 1900 the Trans-Siberian Railway and the Cape-to-Cairo railroad were under full construction, and the Berlin-to-Baghdad enter- prise was just beginning. By that same date—1900—India, the Balkans, China, and Japan were being covered with a network of railroads, al- though none of these areas, at that date, was sufficiently developed in an industrial sense to provide itself with the steel or copper to construct or to maintain such a network. Later stages in the Transportation Revolu- tion, such as automobiles or radios, spread even more rapidly and were being used to cross the deserts of the Sahara or of Arabia within a gen- eration of their advent in Europe. Another important example of this situation can be seen in the fact that in Europe the Agricultural Revolution began before the Industrial Revo- lution. Because of this, Europe was able to increase its output of food and thus the supply of labor necessary for industrialization. But in the non-European world (except North America) the effort to industrialize generally began before there had been any notable success in obtaining a more productive agricultural system. As a result, the increased supply of food (and thus of labor) needed for the growth of industrial cities in the non-European world has generally been obtained, not from increased output of food so much as from a reduction of the peasants' share of the food produced. In the Soviet Union, especially, the high speed of indus- trialization in the period 1926-1940 was achieved by a merciless oppres- sion of the rural community in which millions of peasants lost their lives. The effort to copy this Soviet method in Communist China in the 1950's brought that area to the verge of disaster. The most important example of such differential diffusion rates of two European developments appears in the difference between the spread of the food-producing revolution and the spread of the revolution in sanitation and medical services. This difference became of such world- shaking consequences by the middle of the twentieth century that we must spend considerable time examining it. In Europe the Agricultural Revolution which served to increase the supply of food began at least fifty years before the beginnings of the revolution in sanitation and medical services which decreased the num- ber of deaths and thus increased the number of the population. The two dates for these two beginnings might be put roughly at 1725 and 1775. As a result of this difference, Europe generally had sufficient food to"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION IN ITS WORLD SETTING 19 feed its increased population. When the population reached a point where Europe itself could no longer feed its own people (say about 1850), the outlying areas of the European and non-European worlds were so eager to' be industrialized (or to obtain railroads) that Europe was able to obtain non-European food in exchange for European industrial prod- ucts. This sequence of events was a very happy combination for Europe. But the sequence of events in the non-European world was quite different and much less happv. Not only did the non-European world get in- dustrialization before it got the revolution in food production; it also got the revolution in sanitation and medical services before it got a suf- ficient increase in food to take care of the resulting increase in popula- tion. As a result, the demographic explosion which began in northwest- ern Europe early in the nineteenth century* spread outward to eastern Europe and to Asia with increasingly unhappy consequences as it spread. The result was to create the greatest social problem of the twentieth- century world. Most stable and primitive societies, such as the American Indians before 149; or medieval Europe, have no great population problem because the birthrate is balanced by the death rate. In such societies both of these are high, the population is stable, and the major portion of that population is young (below eighteen years of age). This kind of society (frequently called Population Type A) is what existed in Europe in the medieval pe- riod (say about 1400) or even in part of the early modern period (say about 1700). As a result of the increased supply of food in Europe after 1725, and of men's increased ability to save lives because of advances in sanitation and medicine after 1775, the death rate began to fall, the birth- rate remained high, the population began to increase, and the number of older persons in the society increased. This gave rise to what we have called the demographic explosion (or Population Type B). As a result of it, the population of Europe (beginning in western Europe) increased in the nineteenth century, and the major portion of that population was in the prime of life (ages eighteen to forty-five), the arms-bearing years for men and the childoearing years for women. At this point the demographic cycle of an expanding population goes into a third stage (Population Type C) in which the birthrate also begins to fall. The reasons for this fall in the birthrate have never been explained in a satisfactory way, but, as a consequence of it, there appears a new demographic condition marked by a falling birthrate, a low death rate, and a stabilizing and aging population whose major part is in the mature years from thirty to sixty. As the population gets older because of the decrease in births and the increase in expectation of life, a larger and larger part of the population has passed the years of bearing children or bearing arms. This causes the birthrate to decline even more rapidly, and eventually gives a population so old that the death rate begins to rise again because of the great increase in deaths from old age or from the"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"20  TRAGEDY AND HOPE casualties of inevitable senility. Accordingly, the society passes into a fourth stage of the demographic cycle (Population Type D). This stage is marked bv a declining birthrate, a rising death rate, a decreasing popu- lation, and a population in which the major part is over fifty years of age. It must be confessed that the nature of the fourth stage of this demo- graphic cycle is based on theoretical considerations rather than on em- pirical observation, because even western Europe, where the cycle is most advanced, has not yet reached this fourth stage. However, it seems quite likelv that it will pass into such a stage by the year 2000, and already the increasing number of older persons has given rise to new problems and to a new science called geriatrics both in western Europe and in the eastern United States. As we have said, Europe has already experienced the first three stages of this demographic cycle as a result of the Agricultural Revolution after 1725 and the Sanitation-Medical Revolution after 1775. As these two revolutions have diffused outward from western Europe to more periph- eral areas of the world (the lifesaving revolution passing the food-produc- ing revolution in the process), these more remote areas have entered, one by one, upon the demographic cycle. This means that the demographic explosion (Population Type B) has moved outward from western Eu- rope to Central Europe to eastern Europe and finally to Asia and Africa. By the middle of the twentieth century, India was fully in the grasp of the demographic explosion, with its population shooting upward at a rate of about 5 million a year, while Japan's population rose from 55 million in 1920 to 94 million in i960. A fine example of the working of this process can be seen in Ceylon where in 1920 the birthrate was 40 per thousand and the death rate was 32 per thousand, but in 1950 the birthrate was still at 40 while the death rate had fallen to 12. Before we examine the impact of this development on world history in the twentieth century let us look at two brief tables which will clarify this process. The demographic cycle may be divided into four stages which wc have designated by the first four letters of the alphabet. These four stages can be distinguished in respect to four traits: the birthrate, the death rare, the number of the population, and its age distribution. The nature of the four stages in these four respects can be seen in the following tabic: THE DEMOGRAPHIC CYCLE STAGE  A  B  Birthrate  High High Death rate  High Falling Numbers  Stable Rising Age Distribution Many young Many in prime (below 18) (18-45) c Falling Low Stable Many middle- aged (over 30) D Low Rising Falling Many old (over 50)"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION IN ITS WORLD .SETTING 2 1 The consequences of this demographic cycle (and the resulting demo- graphic explosion) as it diffuses outward from western Europe to more peripheral areas of the world may be gathered from the following table which sets out the chronology of this movement in the four areas of western Europe, central Europe, eastern Europe, and Asia: DIFFUSION OF THE DEMOGRAPHIC CYCLE AREAS DATES 1700 1800 1850 1900 1950 2000 •WESTERN- EUROPE A B B **\" w - C C D CENTRAL EUROPE A A - ^ B B \"\" \"\" - C D EASTERN EUROPE A A A - -, B B ~~ - - c ASIA A A A A - - _ B B In this table the line of greatest population pressure (the demographic explosion of Type B population) has been marked by a dotted line. This shows that there has been a sequence, at intervals of about fifty years, of four successive population pressures which might be designated with the following names: Anglo-French pressure, about 1850 Germanic-Italian pressure, about 1900 Slavic pressure, about 1950 Asiatic pressure, about 2000 This diffusion of pressure outward from the western European core of Western Civilization can contribute a great deal toward a richer under- standing of the period 1850-2000. It helps to explain the Anglo-French rivalry about 1850, the Anglo-French alliance based on fear of Germany after 1900, the free-world alliance based on fear of Soviet Russia after 1950, and the danger to both Western Civilization and Soviet Civiliza- tion from Asiatic pressure by 2000. These examples show how our understanding of the problems of the twentieth century world can be illuminated by a study of the various developments of western Europe and of the varying rates by which they diffused outward to the more peripheral portions of Western Civilization and ultimately to the, non-Western world. In a rough fashion we might list these developments in the order in which they"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"22 TRAGEDY AND HOPE appeared in western Europe as well as the order in which they appeared in the more remote non-Western world: DEVELOPMENTS IN WESTERN EUROPE I. Western ideology 2. Revolution in weapons (espe- ciallv firearms) 3. Agricultural Revolution Industrial Revolution Revolution in sanitation and medicine Demographic explosion Revolution in transportation and communications DEVELOPMENTS IN ASIA 1. Revolution in weapons 2. Revolution in transport and communications 3. Revolution in sanitation and medicine 4. Industrial Revolution 5. Demographic explosion 6. Agricultural Revolution 7. And last (if at all), Western ideology. Naturally, these two lists are only a rough approximation to the truth. In the European list it should be quite clear that each develop- ment is listed in the order of its first beginning and that each of these traits has been a continuing process of development since. In the Asiatic list it should be clear that the order of arrival of the different traits is quite different in different areas and that the order given on this list is merely one which seems to apply to several important areas. Naturally, the problems arising from the advent of these traits in Asiatic areas depend on the order in which the traits arrive, and thus are quite different in areas where this order of arrival is different. The chief difference arises from a reversal of order between items 3 and 4. The fact that Asia obtained these traits in a different order from that of Europe is of the greatest significance. We shall devote much of the rest of this book to examining this subject. At this point we might point out two aspects of it. In 1830 democracy was growing rapidly in Europe and in America. At that time the development of weapons had reached a point where governments could not get weapons which were much more effective than those which private individuals could get. Moreover, private individuals could obtain good weapons because they had a high enough standard of living to afford it (as a result of the Agricultural Revolution) and such weapons were cheap (as a result of the Industrial Revolution). By 1930 (and even more by 1950) the development of weapons had advanced to the point where governments could obtain more effective weapons (dive-bombers, armored cars, flamethrowers, poisonous gases, and such) than private individuals. Moreover, in Asia, these better weapons arrived before standards of living could be raised bv the Agricultural Revolution or costs of weapons reduced sufficiently by the Industrial Revolution. Moreover, standards of living were held down in Asia because the Sanitation-"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION IN ITS WORLD SETTING 23 Medical Revolution and the demographic explosion arrived before the Agricultural Revolution. As a result, governments in Europe in 1830 hardly dared to oppress the people, and democracy was growing; but in the non-European world by 1930 (and even more by 1950) govern- ments did dare to, and could, oppress their peoples, who could do little to prevent it. When we add to this picture the fact that the ideology of Western Europe had strong democratic elements derived from its Christian and scientific traditions, while Asiatic countries had authoritarian traditions in political life, we can see that democracy had a hopeful future in Europe in 1830 but a very dubious future in Asia in 1950. From another point of view we can see that in Europe the sequence of Agncultural-Industrial-Transportation revolutions made it possible for Europe to have rising standards of living and little rural oppression, since the Agricultural Revolution provided the food and thus the labor for industrialism and for transport facilities. But in Asia, where the sequence of these three revolutions was different (generally: Transporta- tion-Industrial-Agricultural), labor could be obtained from the Sanitary- Medical Revolution, but food for this labor could be obtained only by oppressing the rural population and preventing any real improvements in standards of living. Some countries tried to avoid this by borrowing capital for railroads and steel mills from European countries rather than by raising capital from the savings of their own people, but this meant that these countries became the debtors (and thus to some extent the subordinates) of Europe. Asiatic nationalism usually came to resent tins debtor role and to prefer the role of rural oppression of its own people by its own government. The most striking example of this pref- erence for rural oppression over foreign indebtedness was made in the Soviet Union in 1928 with the opening of the Five-Year plans. Some- what similar but less drastic choices were made even earlier in Japan and much later in China. But we must never forget that these and other difficult choices had to be made by Asiatics because they obtained the diffused traits of Western Civilization in an order different from that m which Europe obtained them."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"H TRAGEDY AND HOPE Europe's Shift to the Twentieth Century While Europe's traits were diffusing outward to the non-European world, Europe was also undergoing profound changes and facing difficult choices at home. These choices were associated with drastic changes, in some cases we might sav reversals, of Europe's point of view. These changes mav be examined under eight headings. The nineteenth century was marked by (i) belief in the innate goodness of man; (2) secular- ism; (3) belief in progress; (4) liberalism; (5) capitalism; (6) faith in science; (7) democracy; (8) nationalism. In general, these eight factors went along together in the nineteenth century. They were generally re- garded as being compatible with one another; the friends of one were generally the friends of the others; and the enemies of one were gen- erally the enemies of the rest. Metternich and De Alaistre were generally opposed to all eight; Thomas Jefferson and John Stuart Mill were generally in favor of all eight. The belief in the innate goodness of man had its roots in the eight- eenth centurv when it appeared to many that man was born good and free but was everywhere distorted, corrupted, and enslaved by bad institutions and conventions. As Rousseau said, \"Man is born free yet everywhere he is in chains.\" Thus arose the belief in the \"noble savage,\" the romantic nostalgia for nature and for the simple nobility and honesty of the inhabitants of a faraway land. If only man could be freed, they felt, freed from the corruption of society and its artificial conventions, freed from the burden of property, of the state, of the clergy, and of the rules of matrimony, then man, it seemed clear, could rise to heights undreamed of before—could, indeed, become a kind of superman, prac- tically a god. It was this spirit which set loose the French Revolution. It was this spirit which prompted the outburst of self-reliance and optimism so characteristic of the whole period from 1770 to 1914. Obviously, if man is innately good and needs but to be freed from social restrictions, he is capable of tremendous achievements in this world of time, and does not need to postpone his hopes of personal salvation into eternity. Obviously, if man is a godlike creature whose ungodlike actions arc due only to the frustrations of social conventions, there is no need to worry about service to God or devotion to anv otherworldly end. Man can accomplish most bv service to himself and"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION IN ITS WORLD SETTING 25 devotion to the goals of this world. Thus came the triumph of secular- ism. Closely related to these nineteenth century beliefs that human nature is good, that society is bad, and that optimism and secularism were reasonable attitudes were certain theories about the nature of evil. To the nineteenth century mind evil, or sin, was a negative concep- tion. It merely indicated a lack or, at most, a distortion of good. Any idea of sin or evil as a malignant positive force opposed to good, and capable of existing by its own nature, was completely lacking in the typical nineteenth-centurv mind. To such a mind the only evil was frustration and the only sin, repression. Just as the negative idea of the nature of evil flowed from the belief that human nature was good, so the idea of liberalism flowed from the belief that society w^as bad. For, if society was bad, the state, which was the organized coercive power of society, was doubly bad, and if man was good, he should be freed, above all, from the coercive power or the state. Liberalism was the crop which emerged from this soil. In its broadest aspect liberalism believed that men should be freed from coercive power as completely as possible. In its narrowest aspect liberal- ism believed that the economic activities of man should be freed com- pletely from \"state interference.\" This latter belief, summed up in the battle-cry \"No government in business,\" was commonly called \"laissez- faire.\" Liberalism, which included laissez-faire, was a wider term be- cause it would have freed men from the coercive power of any church, army, or other institution, and would have left to society little power beyond that required to prevent the strong from physically oppressing the weak. rrom either aspect liberalism was based on an almost universally ac- cepted nineteenth-century superstition known as the \"community of interests.\" This strange, and unexamined, belief held that there really existed, in the long run, a community of interests between the members of a society. It maintained that, in the long run, what was good for one member of society was good for all and that what was bad for one was bad for all. But it went much further than this. The theory of the \"community of interests\" believed that there did exist a possible social pattern in which each member of society would be secure, free, and prosperous, and that this pattern could \"be achieved by a process of adjustment so that each person could fall into that place in the pattern to which his innate abilities entitled him. This implied two corollaries winch the nineteenth century was prepared to accept: (i) that human abilities are innate and can only be distorted or suppressed by social discipline and (:) that each individual is the best judge of his own self- interest. All these together form the doctrine of the \"community of interests,\" a doctrine which maintained that if each individual does"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"26  TRAGEDY AND HOPE what seems best for himself the result, in the long run, will be best for society as a whole. Closely related to the idea of the \"community of interests\" were two other beliefs of the nineteenth century: the belief in progress and in democracy. The average man of 1880 was convinced that he was the culmination of a long process of inevitable progress which had been going on for untold millennia and which would continue indefinitely into the future. This belief in progress was so fixed that it tended to regard progress as both inevitable and automatic. Out of the struggles and conflicts of the universe better things were constantly emerging, and the wishes or plans of the objects themselves had little to do with the process. The idea of democracy was also accepted as inevitable, although not always as desirable, for the nineteenth century could not completely submerge a lingering feeling that rule by the best or rule by the strong would be better than rule by the majority. But the facts of political development made rule by the majority unavoidable, and it came to be accepted, at least in western Europe, especially since it was compatible with liberalism and with the community of interests. Liberalism, community of interests, and the belief in progress led almost inevitably to the practice and theory of capitalism. Capitalism was an economic system in which the motivating force was the desire for private profit as determined in a price system. Such a system, it was felt, by seeking the aggrandization of profits for each individual, would give unprecedented economic progress under liberalism and in accord with the community of interests. In the nineteenth century this system, in association with the unprecedented advance of natural science, had given rise to industrialism (that is, power production) and urbanism (that is, city life), both of which were regarded as inevitable concomitants of progress by most people, but with the greatest suspicion by a per- sistent and vocal minority. The nineteenth century was also an age of science. By this term we mean the belief that the universe obeyed rational laws which could be found by observation and could be used to control it. This belief was closely connected with the optimism of the period, with its belief in inevitable progress, and with secularism. The latter appeared as a tend- ency toward materialism. This could be defined as the belief that all reality is ultimately explicable in terms of the physical and chemical laws which apply to temporal matter. The last attribute of the nineteenth century is by no means the least: nationalism. It was the great age of nationalism, a movement which has been discussed in many lengthy and inconclusive books but which can be defined for our purposes as \"a movement for political unity with those with whom we believe we are akin.\" As such, nationalism in the"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION IN ITS WORLD SETTING 27 nineteenth century had a dynamic force which worked in two direc- tions. On the one side, it served to bind persons of the same nationality together into a tight, emotionally satisfying, unit. On the other side, it served to divide persons of different nationality into antagonistic groups, often to the injury of their real mutual political, economic, or cultural advantages. Thus, in the period to which we refer, nationalism some- times acted as a cohesive force, creating a united Germany and a united Italy out of a medley of distinct political units. But sometimes, on the other hand, nationalism acted as a disruptive force within such dynastic states as the Habsburg Empire or the Ottoman Empire, splitting these great states into a number of distinctive political units. These characteristics of the nineteenth century have been so largely modified in the twentieth century that it might appear, at first glance, as if the latter were nothing more than the opposite of the former. This is not completely accurate, but there can be no doubt that most of these characteristics have been drastically modified in the twentieth century. This change has arisen from a series of shattering experiences which have profoundly disturbed patterns of behavior and of belief, of social organizations and human hopes. Of these shattering experiences the chief were the trauma of the First World War, the long-drawn-out agony of the world depression, and the unprecedented violence of destruction of the Second World War. Of these three, the First World War was undoubtedly the most important. To a people who believed in the innate goodness of man, in inevitable progress, in the community of interests, and in evil as merely the absence of good, the First World War, with its millions of persons dead and its billions of dollars wasted, was a blow so terrible as to be beyond human ability to comprehend. As a matter of fact, no real success was achieved in comprehending it. the people of the day regarded it as a temporary and inexplicable aberration to be ended as soon as possible and forgotten as soon as ended. Accordingly, men were almost unanimous, in 1919, in their determination to restore the world of 1913. This effort was a failure. After ten years of effort to conceal the new reality of social life by a facade painted to look like 191j, the facts burst through the pretense, and men were forced, willingly or not, to face the grim reality of the twentieth century. The events which destroyed the pretty dream world of 1919-1929 were the stock-market crash, the world depression, the world financial crisis, and ultimately the martial clamor of rearmament and aggression. Thus depression and war forced men to realize that the old world of the nineteenth century had passed forever, and made them seek to create a new world in accordance with the facts of present-day conditions. This new world, the child of the period of 1914-1945, as- sumed its recognizable form only as the first half of the century drew to a close."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"28  TRAGEDY AND HOPE In contrast with the nineteenth-century belief that human nature is innately good and that society is corrupting, the twentieth century came to believe that human nature is, if not innately bad, at least capable of being very evil. Left to himself, it seems today, man falls very easily to the level of the jungle or even lower, and this result can be prevented only bv training and the coercive power of society. Thus, man is capable of great evil, but society can prevent this. Along with this change from (food men and bad society to bad men and good society has appeared a reaction from optimism to pessimism and from secularism to religion. At the same time the view that evil is merely the absence of good has been replaced with the idea that evil is a very positive force which must be resisted and overcome. The horrors of Hitler's concentration camps and of Stalin's slave-labor units are chiefly responsible for this change. Associated with these changes are a number of others. The belief that human abilities are innate and should be left free from social duress in order to display themselves has been replaced by the idea that human abilities are the result of social training and must be directed to socially acceptable ends. Thus liberalism and laissez-faire are to be replaced, apparently, by social discipline and planning. The community of interests which would appear if men were merely left to pursue their own de- sires has been replaced by the idea of the welfare community, which must be created by conscious organizing action. The belief in progress has been replaced by the fear of social retrogression or even human annihilation. The old march of democracy now yields to the insidious advance of authoritarianism, and the individual capitalism of the profit motive seems about to be replaced by the state capitalism of the welfare economy. Science, on all sides, is challenged by mysticisms, some of which march under the banner of science itself; urbanism has passed its peak and is replaced by suburbanism or even \"flight to the country\"; and nationalism finds its patriotic appeal challenged by appeals to much wider groups of class, ideological, or continental scope. We have already given some attention to the fashion in which a number of western-European innovations, such as industrialism and the demographic explosion, diffused outward to the peripheral non- European world at such different rates of speed that they arrived in Asia in quite a different order from that in which they had left western Europe. The same phenomenon can be seen within Western Civilization in regard to the nineteenth-century characteristics of Europe which we have enumerated. For example, nationalism was already evident in Eng- land at the time of the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588; it raged through France in the period after 1789; it reached Germany and Italy only after 1815, became a potent force in Russia and the Balkans to- ward the end of the nineteenth century, and was noticeable in China, India, and Indonesia, and even Negro Africa, only in the twentieth"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION IN ITS WORLD SETTING 20 century. Somewhat similar patterns of diffusion can be found in regard to the spread of democracy, of parliamentary government, of liberalism, and of secularism. The rule, however, is not so general or so simple as it appears at first glance. The exceptions and the complications ap- pear more numerous as we approach the twentieth century. Even earlier it was evident that the arrival of the sovereign state did not follow this pattern, enlightened despotism and the growth of supreme public authority appearing in Germany, and even in Italy, before it appeared in France. Universal free education also appeared in central Europe before it appeared in a western country like England. Social- ism also is a product of central Europe rather than of western Europe, and moved from the former to the latter only in the fifth decade of the twentieth century. These exceptions to the general rule about the eastward movement of modern historical developments have various explanations. Some of these are obvious, but others are very compli- cated. As an example of such a complication we might mention that in western Europe nationalism, industrialism, liberalism, and democracy were generally reached in this order. But in Germany they all appeared about the same time. To the Germans it appeared that thev could achieve nationalism and industrialism (both of which they wanted) more rapidly and more successfully if they sacrificed liberalism and democracy. Thus, in Germany nationalism was achieved in an undemo- cratic way, by \"blood and iron,\" as Bismarck put it, while industrialism was achieved under state auspices rather than through liberalism. This selection of elements and the resulting playing off of elements against one another was possible in more peripheral areas only because these areas had the earlier experience of western Europe to study, copy, avoid, or modify. Sometimes they had to modify these traits as thev developed. This can be seen from the following considerations. When the Industrial Revolution began in England and France, these countries were able to raise the necessary capital for new factories because they already had the Agricultural Revolution and because, as the earliest producers of industrial goods, thev made excessive profits which could be used to provide capital. But in Germany and in Russia, capital was much more difficult to find, because they obtained the Industrial Revolu- tion later, when they had to compete with England and France, and could not earn such large profits and also because they did not already have an established Agricultural Revolution on which to build their Industrial Revolution. Accordingly, while western Europe, with plenty of capital and cheap, democratic weapons, could finance its industrializa- tion with liberalism and democracy, central and eastern Europe had difficulty financing industrialism, and there the process was delayed to a period when cheap and simple democratic weapons were bein^ replaced by expensive and complicated weapons. This meant that the capital for"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"30   TRAGEDY AND HOPE railroads and factories had to be raised with government assistance; liberalism waned; rising nationalism encouraged this tendency; and the undemocratic nature of existing weapons made it clear that both liberal- ism and democracy were living a most precarious existence. As a consequence of situations such as this, some of the traits which arose in western Europe in the nineteenth century moved outward to more peripheral areas of Europe and Asia with great difficulty and for only a brief period. Among these less sturdy traits of western Europe's great century we might mention liberalism, democracy, the parlia- mentary system, optimism, and the belief in inevitable progress. These were, we might sav, flowers of such delicate nature that they could not survive any extended period of stormy weather. That the twentieth century subjected them to long periods of very stormy weather is clear when we consider that it brought a world economic depression sand- wiched between two world wars."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"II WESTERN CIVILIZATION TO 1914"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"The Pattern of Change European Economic Developments COMMERCIAL CAPITALISM INDUSTRIAL CAPITALISM, 177O-185O FINANCIAL CAPITALISM, 1850-I93 I Domestic Financial Practices International Financial Practices THE SITUATION BEFORE I914 The United States to 1917 j"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The Pattern of Change I N order to obtain perspective we sometimes divide the culture of a society, in a somewhat arbitrary fashion, into several different aspects. For example, we can divide a society into six aspects: military, political, economic, social, religious, intellectual. Naturally there are very close connections between these various aspects; and in each aspect there are very close connections between what exists today and what existed in an earlier day. For example, we might want to talk about democracy as a fact on the political level (or aspect). In order to talk about it in an intelligent way we would not only have to know what it is today we would also have to see what relationship it has to earlier facts on the political level as well as its relationship to various facts on the other five levels of the society. Naturally we cannot talk intelligently unless we have a fairly clear idea of what we mean by the words we use. For that reason we shall frequently define the terms we use in dis- cussing this subject. The military level is concerned with the organization of force, the political level with the organization of power, and the economic level with the organization of wealth. By the \"organization of power\" in a societv we mean the ways in which obedience and consent (or acquiescence) are obtained. The close relationships between levels can be seen from the fact that there are three basic ways to win obedience: by force, by buying consent with wealth, and by persuasion. Each of these three leads us to another level (military, economic, or intellectual) outside the political level. At the same time, the organization of power today (that is, of the methods for obtaining obedience in the society) is a development of the methods used to obtain obedience in the society in an earlier period. These relationships arc important because in the twentieth century in Western Civilization all six levels are changing with amazing rapidity, and the relationships between levels arc also shifting with great speed. When we add to this confusing picture of Western Civilization the fact that other societies are influencing it or being influenced by it, it would seem that the world in the twentieth century is almost too com- 53"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"34  TRAGEDY AND HOPE plicated to understand. This is indeed true, and we shall have to simplify (perhaps even oversimplify) these complexities in order to reach a low level of understanding. When we have reached such a low level perhaps we shall be able to raise the level of our understanding by bringing into our minds, little by little, some of the complexities which do exist in the world itself. On the military level in Western Civilization in the twentieth cen- tury the chief development has been a steady increase in the complexity and the cost of weapons. When weapons are cheap to get and so easy to use that almost anyone can use them after a short period of training, armies are generally made up of large masses of amateur soldiers. Such weapons we call \"amateur weapons,\" and such armies we might call \"mass armies of citizen-soldiers.\" The Age of Pericles in Classical Greece and the nineteenth century in Western Civilization were periods of amateur weapons and citizen-soldiers. But the nineteenth century was preceded (as was the Age of Pericles also) by a period in which weap- ons were expensive and required long training in their use. Such weapons we call \"specialist\" weapons. Periods of specialist weapons are generally periods of small armies of professional soldiers (usually mer- cenaries). In a period of specialist weapons the minority who have such weapons can usually force the majority who lack them to obey; thus a period of specialist weapons tends to give rise to a period of minority rule and authoritarian government. But a period of amateur weapons is a period in which all men are roughly equal in military power, a majority can compel a minority to yield, and majority rule or even democratic government tends to rise. The medieval period in which the best weapon was usually a mounted knight on horseback (clearly a specialist weapon) was a period of minority rule and authori- tarian government. Even when the medieval knight was made obsolete (along with his stone castle) by the invention of gunpowder and the appearance of firearms, these new weapons were so expensive and so difficult to use (until 1800) that minority rule and authoritarian govern- ment continued even though that government sought to enforce its rule by shifting from mounted knights to professional pikemen and musketeers. But after 1800, guns became cheaper to obtain and easier to use. By 1840 a Colt revolver sold for $27 and a Springfield musket for not much more, and these were about as good weapons as anyone could get at that time. Thus, mass armies of citizens, equipped with these cheap and easily used weapons, began to replace armies of profes- sional soldiers, beginning about 1800 in Europe and even earlier in America. At the same time, democratic government began to replace authoritarian governments (but chiefly in those areas where the cheap new weapons were available and local standards of living were high enough to allow people to obtain them)."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION TO I 9 I 4  35  The arrival of the mass army of citizen-soldiers in the nineteenth century created a difficult problem of control, because techniques of transportation and of communications had not reached a high-enough level to allow any flexibility of control in a mass armv. Such an army could be moved on its own feet or bv railroad; the government could communicate with its various units only by letter post or by telegram. The problem of handling a mass army by such techniques was solved partially in the American Civil War of 1861-1865 and completely by Helmuth von Moltke for the Kingdom of Prussia in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. The solution was a rigid one: a plan of campaign was prepared beforehand against a specific opponent, with an established timetable and detailed instructions for each militarv unit; communica- tions were prepared and even issued beforehand, to be used according to the timetable. This plan was so inflexible that the signal to mobilize was practically a signal to attack a specified neighboring state because the plan, once initiated, could not be changed and could hardly even be slowed up. With this rigid method Prussia created the German Empire by smashing Austria in 1866 and France in 1871. By 1900 all the states of Europe had adopted the same method and had fixed plans in which the signal for mobilization constituted an attack on some neighbor—a neighbor, in some cases (as in the German invasion of Belgium), with whom the attacker had no real quarrel. Thus, when the signal for mobilization was given in 1914 the states of Europe leaped at each other. In the twentieth century the militarv situation was drastically changed in two ways. On the one hand, communications and transportation were so improved bv the invention of the radio and the internal-com- bustion engine that control and movement of troops and even of indi- vidual soldiers became very flexible; mobilization ceased to be equivalent to attack, and attack ceased to be equivalent to total war. On the other hand, beginning with the first use of tanks, gas, high-explosive shells, and tactical bombing from the air in 1915-1918, and continuing with all the innovations in weapons leading up to the first atomic bomb in 1945, specialist weapons became superior to amateur weapons. This had a double result which was still working itself out at mid-centurv: the drafted army of citizen-soldiers began to be replaced by a smaller army of professional specialist soldiers, and authoritarian government began to replace democratic government. On the political level equally profound changes took place in the twentieth centurv. These changes were associated with the basis on which an appeal for allegiance could be placed, and especially with the need to find a basis of allegiance which could win lovalty over larger and larger areas from more numerous groups of people. In the early .Middle Ages when there had been no state and no public authority,"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"36   TRAGEDY AND HOPE political organization had been the feudal system which was held together bv obligations of personal fealty among a small number of people. With the reappearance of the state and of public authority, new patterns of political behavior were organized in what is called the \"feudal monarchy.\" This allowed the state to reappear for the first time since the collapse of Charlemagne's Empire in the ninth century, but with restricted allegiance to a relatively small number of persons over a relatively small area. The development of weapons and the steady improvement in transportation and in communications made it possible to compel obedience over wider and wider areas, and made it necessary to base allegiance on something wider than personal fealty to a feudal monarch. Accordingly, the feudal monarchy was replaced by the dy- nastic monarchy. In this system subjects owed allegiance to a royal family (dynasty), although the real basis of the dynasty rested on the lovalty of a professional army of pikemen and musketeers. The shift from the professional army of mercenaries to the mass army of citizen-soldiers, along with other factors acting on other levels of culture, made it necessary to broaden the basis of allegiance once again after 1800. The new basis was nationalism, and gave rise to the national state as the typical political unit of the nineteenth century. This shift was not possible for the larger dynastic states which ruled over many different language and national groups. By the year 1900 three old dynastic monarchies were being threatened with disintegration by the rising tide of nationalistic agitation. These three, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the Russian Empire of the Romanovs, did disintegrate as a consequence of the defeats of the First World War. But the smaller territorial units which replaced them, states like Poland, Czechoslovakia, or Lithuania, organized largely on the basis of language groups, may have reflected adequately enough the national- istic sentiments of the nineteenth century, but they reflected very in- adequately the developments in weapons, in communications, in transportation, and in economics of the twentieth century. By the middle of this latter century these developments were reaching a point where states which could produce the latest instruments of coercion were in a position to compel obedience over areas much larger than those occupied bv peoples speaking the same language or otherwise re- garding themselves as sharing a common nationality. Even as early as 1940 it began to appear that some new basis more continental in scope than existing nationality groups must be found for the new superstates which were beginning to be born. It became clear that the basis of al- legiance for these new superstates of continental scope must be ideologi- cal rather than national. Thus the nineteenth century's national state began to be replaced by the twentieth century's ideological bloc. At the same time, the shift from amateur to specialist weapons made it likely"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION' TO I914  37  that the new form of organization would be authoritarian rather than democratic as the earlier national state had been. However, the prestige of Britain's power and influence in the nineteenth century was so great in the first third of the twentieth century that the British parliamentary system continued to be copied everywhere that people were called upon to set up a new form of government. This happened in Russia in 1917, in Turkey in 1908, in Czechoslovakia and Poland in 1918-1919 and in most of the states of Asia (such as China in 1911). When we turn to the economic level, we turn to a series of complex developments. It would be pleasant if we could just ignore these, but ob- viouslv we cannot, because economic issues have been of paramount im- portance in the twentieth century, and no one can understand the period without at least a rudimentary grasp of the economic issues. In order to simplify these somewhat, we may divide them into four as- pects: (a) energy; {b) materials; (c) organization; and (d) control. It is quite clear that no economic goods can be made without the use of energy and of materials. The history of the former falls into two chief parts each of which is divided into two subparts. The main division, about 1S30, separates an earlier period when production used the energy delivered through living bodies and a later period when production used energy from fossil fuels delivered through engines. The first half is subdivided into an earlier period of manpower (and slavery) and a later period using the energy of draft animals. This subdivision occurred roughly about A.D. 1000. The second half (since 1830) is subdivided into a period which used coal in steam engines, and a period which used petroleum in internal-combustion engines. This subdivision occurred about 1900 or a little later. The development of the use of materials is familiar to everyone. We can speak of an age of iron (before 1830), an age of steel (1830-1910), and an age of alloys, light metals, and synthetics (since 1910). Naturally, all these dates arc arbitrary and approximate, since the different periods commenced at different dates in different areas, diffusing outward from their origin in the core area of Western Civilization in northwestern Europe. When we turn to the developments which took place in economic organization, we approach a subject of great significance. Here again we can see a sequence of several periods. There were six of these peri- ods, each with its own typical form of economic organization. At the beginning, in the early Middle Ages, Western Civilization had an eco- nomic system which was almost entirely agricultural, organized in self- sufficient manors, with almost no commerce or industry. To this manorial-agrarian svstem there was added, after about 1050, a new economic system based on trade in luxury goods of remote origin for the sake of profits. This we might call commercial capitalism. It had"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"38  TRAGEDY AND HOPE two periods of expansion, one in the period 1050-12 70, and the other in the period 1440-1690. The typical organization of these two periods was the trading company (in the second we might say the chartered trading company, like the Massachusetts Bay Company, the Hudson's Bay Company, or the various East India companies). The next period of economic organization was the stage of industrial capitalism, beginning about 1770, and characterized by owner management through the single-proprietorship or the partnership. The third period we might call financial capitalism. It began about 1850, reached its peak about 1914, and ended about 1932. Its typical forms of economic organization were the limited-liability corporation and the holding company. It was a period of financial or banker management rather than one of owner management as in the earlier period of industrial capitalism. This period of financial capitalism was followed by a period of monopoly capital- ism. In this fourth period, typical forms of economic organization were cartels and trade associations. This period began to appear about 1890, took over control of the economic system from the bankers about 1932, and is distinguished as a period of managerial dominance in con- trast with the owner management and the financial management of the two periods immediately preceding it. Many of its characteristics con- tinue, even today, but the dramatic events of World War II and the post-war period put it in such a different social and historical context as to create a new, sixth, period of economic organization which might be called \"the pluralist economy.\" The features of this sixth period will be described later. The approximate relationship of these various stages may be seen in the following table: NAME .Manorial Commercial capitalism Industrial capitalism Financial capitalism Monopoly capitalism Pluralist economy DATES 670- a. 1050-1270 b. 1440-1690 1770-1870 1850-1032 1800-1950 1054 represent TYPICAL ORGANIZATION Manor Company Chartered contpanv Private firm or partnership Corporation and holding company Cartels and trade association Lobbying groups MANAGEMENT Custom Municipal mercantilism State mercantilism Owners Bankers Managers Technocrats Two things should be noted. In the first place, these various stages or periods are additive in a sense, and there are many survivals of earlier"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"WESTERN' CIVILIZATION TO 1914  39  stages into later ones. As late as 1925 there was a manor still functioning in England, and Cecil Rhodes's chartered company which opened up Rhodesia (the British South Africa Company) was chartered as late as 1889. In the same way owner-managed private firms engaging in indus- trial activities, or corporations and holding companies engaging in finan- cial activities, could be created today. In the second place all the later periods are called capitalism. This term means \"an economic system motivated by the pursuit of profits within a price system.\" The com- mercial capitalist sought profits from the exchange of goods; the indus- trial capitalist sought profits from the manufacture of goods; the financial capitalist sought profits from the manipulation of claims on money; and the monopoly capitalist sought profits from manipulation of the market to make the market price and the amount sold such that his profits would be maximized. It is interesting to note that, as a consequence of these various stages of economic organization, Western Civilization has passed through four major stages of economic expansion marked by the approximate dates 970-1270, 1440-1690, 1770-1928, and since 1950. Three of these stages of expansion were followed by the outbreak of imperialist wars, as the stage of expansion reached its conclusion. These were the Hundred Years' War and the Italian Wars (1338-1445, 1494-1559), the Second Hundred Years' War (1667-1815), and the world wars (1914-1945). The economic background of the third of these will be examined later in this chapter, but now we must continue our general survey of the conditions of Western Civilization in regard to other aspects of culture. One of these is the fourth and last portion of the economic level, that concerned with economic control. Economic control has passed through four stages in Western Civiliza- tion. Of these the first and third were periods of \"automatic control\" in the sense that there was no conscious effort at a centralized system of eco- nomic control, while the second and fourth stages were periods of con- scious efforts at control. These stages, with approximate dates, were as follows: 1. Automatic control: manorial custom, 650-1150 2. Conscious control a. municipal mercantilism, 1150-1450 b. state mercantilism, 1450-1815 3. Automatic control: laissez-faire in the competitive market, 1815- r 934 4. Conscious control: planning (both public and private), 1934— It should be evident that these five stages of economic control are closely associated with the stages previously mentioned in regard to kinds"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"40  TRAGEDY AND HOPE of weapons on the military level or the forms of government on the polit- ical level. The same five stages of economic control have a complex relationship to the six stages of economic organization already mentioned, the important stage of industrial capitalism overlapping the transition from state mercantilism to laissez-faire. When we turn to the social level of a culture, we can note a num- ber of different phenomena, such as changes in growth of population, changes in aggregates of this population (such as rise or decline of cities), and changes in social classes. Most of these things are far too complicated for us to attempt to treat them in any thorough fashion here. We have already discussed the various stages in population growth, and shown that Europe was, about 1900, generally passing from a stage of population growth with manv persons in the prime of life (Type B), to a stage of population stabilization with a larger percentage of middle-aged persons (Type C). This shift from Type B to Type C population in Europe can be placed most roughly 3t the time that the nineteenth century gave rise to the twentieth century. At about the same time or shortly after, and closely associated with the rise of monopoly capitalism (with its em- phasis on automobiles, telephones, radio, and such), was a shift in the aggregation of population. This shift was from the period we might call \"the rise of the city\" (in which, year by year, a larger portion of the population lived in cities) to what we might call \"the rise of the suburbs\" or even \"the period of megapolis\" (in which the growth of residential concentration moved outward from the city itself into the surrounding area). The third aspect of the social level to which we might turn our atten- tion is concerned with changes in social classes. Each of the stages in the development of economic organization was accompanied by the rise to prominence of a new social class. The medieval system had provided the feudal nobility based on the manorial agrarian system. The growth of commercial capitalism (in two stages) gave a new class of commercial bourgeoisie. The growth of industrial capitalism gave rise to two new classes, the industrial bourgeoisie and the industrial workers (or prole- tariat, as they were sometimes called in Europe). The development of financial and monopoly capitalism provided a new group of managerial technicians. The distinction between industrial bourgeoisie and managers essentially rests on the fact that the former control industry and possess power because thev are owners, while managers control industry (and also government or labor unions or public opinion) because they are skilled or trained in certain techniques. As we shall see later, the shift from one to the other was associated with a separation of control from owner- ship in economic life. The shift was also associated with what we might call a change from a two-class society to a middle-class society. Under industrial capitalism and the early part of financial capitalism, society"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION TO I 9 I 4  41  began to develop into a polarized two-class society in which an en- trenched bourgeoisie stood opposed to a mass proletariat. It was on the basis of this development that Karl Marx, about 1850, formed his ideas of an inevitable class struggle in which the group of owners would become fewer and fewer and richer and richer while the mass of workers be- came poorer and poorer but more and more numerous, until finally the mass would rise up and take ownership and control from the privileged minority. Bv 1900 social developments took a direction so different from that expected by Marx that his analysis became almost worthless, and his system had to be imposed by force in a most backward industrial coun- try (Russia) instead of occurring inevitably in the most advanced indus- trial country as he had expected. The social developments which made Marx's theories obsolete were the result of technological and economic developments which Marx had not foreseen. The energy for production was derived more and more from inanimate sources of power and less and less from human labor. As a result, mass production required less labor. But mass production re- quired mass consumption so that the products of the new techology had to be distributed to the working groups as well as to others so that ris- ing standards of living for the masses made the proletariat fewer and fewer and richer and richer. At the same time, the need for managerial and white-collar workers of the middle levels of the economic system raised the proletariat into the middle class in large numbers. The spread of the corporate form of industrial enterprise allowed control to be sepa- rated from ownership and allowed the latter to be dispersed over a much wider group, so that, in effect, owners became more and more numerous and poorer and poorer. And, finally, control shifted from owners to managers. The result was that the polarized two-class society envisaged by Marx was, after 1900, increasingly replaced by a mass middle-class society, with fewer poor and, if not fewer rich, at least a more numerous group of rich who were relatively less rich than in an earlier period. This process of leveling up the poor and leveling down the rich originated in economic forces but was speeded up and extended by governmental poli- cies in regard to taxation and social welfare, especially after 1945. When we turn to the higher levels of culture, such as the religious and intellectual aspects, we can discern a sequence of stages similar to those which have been found in the more material levels. We shall make no extended examination of these at this time except to say that the religious level has seen a shift from a basically secularist, materialist, and anti- religious outlook in the late nineteenth century to a much more spiritualist and religious point of view in the course of the twentieth century. At the same time a very complex development on the intellectual level has shown a profound shift in outlook from an optimistic and scientific point of view in the period 1860-1890 to a much more pessimistic and irrationalist"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"42  TRAGEDY AND HOPE point of view in the period following 1890. This shift in point of view, which began in a rather restricted group forming an intellectual van- guard about 1800, a group which included such figures as Freud, Sorcl, Berstson, and Proust, spread downward to larger and larger sections of Western society in the course of the new century as a result of the devastating experience of two world wars and the great depression. The results of this process can be seen in the striking contrast between the typical outlook of Europe in the nineteenth century and in the twentieth century as outlined in the preceding chapter. European Economic Developments COMMERCIAL CAPITALISM Western Civilization is the richest and most powerful social organization ever made by man. One reason for this success has been its economic organization. This, as we have said, has passed through six successive stages, of which at least four are called \"capitalism.\" Three features are notable about this development as a whole. In the first place, each stage created the conditions which tended to bring about the next stage; therefore we could sav, in a sense, that each stage committed suicide. The original economic organization of self- sufficient agrarian units (manors) was in a society organized so that its upper ranks—the lords, lay and ecclesiastical—found their desires for necessities so well met that they sought to exchange their surpluses of necessities for luxuries of remote origin. This gave rise to a trade in foreign luxuries (spices, fine textiles, fine metals) which was the first evidence of the stage of commercial capitalism. In this second stage, mer- cantile profits and widening markets created a demand for textiles and other goods which could be met only by application of power to production. This gave the third stage: industrial capitalism. The stage of industrial capitalism soon gave rise to such an insatiable demand for heavy fixed capital, like railroad lines, steel mills, shipyards, and so on, that these investments could not be financed from the profits and private fortunes of individual proprietors. New instruments for financing indus- try came into existence in the form of limited-liability corporations and investment banks. These were soon in a position to control the chief parts of the industrial svstem, since they provided capital to it. This gave rise to financial capitalism. The control of financial capitalism was used to integrate the industrial system into ever-larger units with interlinking financial controls. This made possible a reduction of competition with a"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION TO I 9 I 4  43  resulting increase in profits. As a result, the industrial system soon found that it was again able to finance its own expansion from its own profits, and, with this achievement, financial controls were weakened, and the stage of monopoly capitalism arrived. In this fifth stage, great industrial units, working together either directly or through cartels and trade asso- ciations, were in a position to exploit the majority of the people. The result was a great economic crisis which soon developed into a struggle for control of the state—the minority hoping to use political power to defend their privileged position, the majority hoping to use the state to curtail the power and privileges of the minority. Both hoped to use the power of the state to find some solution to the economic aspects of the crisis. This dualist struggle dwindled with the rise of economic and social pluralism after 1945. The second notable feature of this whole development is that the transition of each stage to the next was associated with a period of depression or low economic activity. This was because each stage, after a n earlier progressive phase, became later, in its final phase, an organization or vested interests more concerned with protecting its established modes of action than in continuing progressive changes by the application of resources to new, improved methods. This is inevitable in any social or- ganization, but is peculiarly so in regard to capitalism. The third notable feature of the whole development is closely related to this special nature of capitalism. Capitalism provides very powerful moti- vations for economic activity because it associates economic motivations so closely with self-interest. But this same feature, which is a source of strength in providing economic motivation through the pursuit of profits, is also a source of weakness owing to the fact that so self-centered a motivation contributes very readily to a loss of economic coordination. Each individual, just because he is so powerfully motivated by self- interest, easily loses sight of the role which his own activities play in the economic system as a whole, and tends to act as if his activities ivere the Whole, with inevitable injury to that whole. We could indicate this by Pointing out that capitalism, because it seeks profits as its primary goal, is never primarily seeking to achieve prosperity, high production, high con- sumption, political power, patriotic improvement, or moral uplift. Any or these may be achieved under capitalism, and any (or all) of them may °e sacrificed and lost under capitalism, depending on this relationship to the primary goal of capitalist activity—the pursuit of profits. During the nine-hundred-year history of capitalism, it has, at various times, con- tributed both to the achievement and to the destruction of these other social goals. The different stages of capitalism have sought to win profits by dif- ferent kinds of economic activities. The original stage, which wc call commercial capitalism, sought profits by moving goods from one place"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"44  TRAGEDY AND HOPE to another. In this effort, goods went from places where thev were less valuable to places where they were more valuable, while moncv, doing the same thing, moved in the opposite direction. This valuation, which determined the movement both of goods and of money and which made them move in opposite directions, was measured by the relationship be- tween these two things. Thus the value of goods was expressed in money, and the value of money was expressed in goods. Goods moved from low- price areas to high-price areas, and money moved from high-price areas to low-price areas, because goods were more valuable where prices were high and money teas more valuable inhere prices ivere lo r co. Thus, clearly, money and goods are not the same thing but are, on the contrary, exactly opposite things. Most confusion in economic thinking arises from failure to recognize this fact. Goods are wealth which you have, while money is a claim on iveaith which you do not have. Thus goods are an asset; money is a debt. If goods are wealth; money is not- ueaith, or negative wealth, or even anti-wealth. They always behave in opposite ways, just as they usually move in opposite directions. If the value of one goes up, the value of the other goes down, and in the same proportion. The value of goods, expressed in money, is called \"prices,\" while the value of money, expressed in goods, is called \"value.\" Commercial capitalism arose when merchants, carrying goods from one area to another, were able to sell these goods at their destination for a price which covered original cost, all costs of moving the goods, includ- ing the merchant's expenses, and a profit. This development, which began as the movement of luxury goods, increased wealth because it led to specialization of activities both in crafts and in agriculture, which increased skills and output, and also brought into the market new commodities. Eventually, this stage of commercial capitalism became institutionalized into a restrictive system, sometimes called \"mercantilism,\" in which merchants sought to gain profits, not from the movements of goods but from restricting the movements of goods. Thus the pursuit of profits, which had earlier led to increased prosperity by increasing trade and production, became a restriction on both trade and production, because profit became an end in itself rather than an accessory mechanism in the economic system as a whole. The way in which commercial capitalism (an expanding economic organization) was transformed into mercantilism (a restrictive economic organization) twice in our past history is very revealing not only of the nature of economic systems, and of men themselves, but also of the nature of economic crisis and what can be done about it. Under commercial capitalism, merchants soon discovered that an in- creasing flow of goods from a low-price area to a high-price area tended to raise prices in the former and to lower prices in the latter. Every time a shipment of spices came into London, the price of spices there"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION TO I 9 I 4  45  began to fall, while the arrival of buyers and ships in Malacca gave prices there an upward spurr. This trend toward equalization of price levels be- tween two areas because of the double, and reciprocal, movement of goods and money jeopardized profits for merchants, however much it may have satisfied producers and consumers at either end. It did this by reducing the price differential between the two areas and thus reducing the mar- gin within which the merchant could make his profit. It did not take shrewd merchants lonq; to realize that they could maintain this price dif- ferential, and thus their profits, if they could restrict the flow of goods, so that an equal volume of money flowed for a reduced volume of goods. In this way, shipments were decreased, costs were reduced, but profits were maintained. Two things are notable in this mercantilist situation. In the first place, the merchant, bv his restrictive practices, was, in essence, increasing his own satisfaction by reducing that of the producer at one end and of the consumer at the other end; he was able to do this because he was in the middle between them. In the second place, so long as the merchant, in his home port, was concerned with goods, he was eager that the prices of goods should be, and remain, high. In the course of time, however, some merchants began to shift their attention from the goods aspect of commercial interchange to the other, monetary, side of the exchange. They began to accumulate the profits of these transactions, and became increasingly concerned, not with the ship- ment and exchange of goods, but with the shipment and exchange of moneys. In time they became concerned with the lending of money to merchants to finance their ships and their activities, advancing money tor both, at high interest rates, secured by claims on ships or goods as col- lateral for repayment. In this process the attitudes and interests of these new bankers became totally opposed to those of the merchants (although few of either recog- nized the situation). Where the merchant had been eager for high prices and was increasingly eager for low interest rates, the banker was eager tor a high value of money (that is, low prices) and high interest rates, tach was concerned to maintain or to increase the value of the half of the transaction (goods for money) with which he was directly concerned, with relative neglect of the transaction itself (which was of course the concern of the producers and the consumers). In sum, specialization of economic activities, by breaking up the eco- nomic process, had made it possible for people to concentrate on one portion of the process and, bv maximizing that portion, to jeopardize the rest. The process was not only broken up into producers, exchangers, and consumers but there were also two kinds of exchangers (one concerned with goods, the other with money), with almost antithetical, short-tertn, aims. The problems which inevitably arose could be solved and the sys-"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"4<5  TRAGEDY AND HOPE tem reformed only by reference to the system as a whole. Unfortunately, however, three parts of the system, concerned with the production, transfer, and consumption of goods, were concrete and clearly visible so that almost anyone could grasp them simply by examining them, while the operations of banking and finance were concealed, scattered, and abstract so that they appeared to many to be difficult. To add to this, bankers themselves did everything thev could to make their activities more secret and more esoteric. Their activities were reflected in mysterious marks in ledgers which were never opened to the curious outsider. In the course of time the central fact of the developing economic sys- tem, the relationship between goods and money, became clear, at least to bankers. This relationship, the price system, depended upon five things: the supply and the demand for goods, the supply and the demand for money, and the speed of exchange between money and goods. An in- crease in three of these (demand for goods, supply of money, speed of circulation) would move the prices of goods up and the value of money down. This inflation was objectionable to bankers, although desirable to producers and merchants. On the other hand, a decrease in the same three items would be deflationary and would please bankers, worry producers and merchants, and delight consumers (who obtained more goods for less money). The other factors worked in the opposite direction, so that an increase in them (supply of goods, demand for money, and slowness of circulation or exchange) would be deflationary. Such changes of prices, either inflationary or deflationary, have been major forces in history for the last six centuries at least. Over that long period, their power to modify men's lives and human history has been increasing. This has been reflected in two ways. On the one hand, rises in prices have generally encouraged increased economic activity, espe- cially the production of goods, while, on the other hand, price changes have served to redistribute wealth within the economic system. Infla- tion, especially a slow steady rise in prices, encourages producers, because it means that they can commit themselves to costs of production on one price level and then, later, offer the finished product for sale at a some- what higher price level. This situation encourages production because it gives confidence of an almost certain profit margin. On the other hand, production is discouraged in a period of falling prices, unless the pro- ducer is in the very unusual situation where his costs are falling more rapidly than the prices of his product. The redistribution of wealth bv changing prices is equally important but attracts much less attention. Rising prices benefit debtors and injure creditors, while falling prices do the opposite. A debtor called upon to pay a debt at a time when prices are higher than when he contracted the debt must yield up less goods and services than he obtained at the earlier date, on a lower price level, when he borrowed the money. A creditor,"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION TO I 9 I 4  47  such as a bank, which has lent money—equivalent to a certain quantity of goods and services—on one price level, gets back the same amount of money—but a smaller quantity of goods and services—when repayment comes at a higher price level, because the monev repaid is then less valu- able. This is why bankers, as creditors in money terms, have been ob- sessed with maintaining the value of money, although the reason they nave traditionally given for this obsession—that \"sound money\" maintains \"business confidence\"—has been propagandist rather than accurate. Hundreds of years ago, bankers began to specialize, with the richer and more influential ones associated increasingly with foreign trade and foreign-exchange transactions. Since these were richer and more cosmo- politan and increasingly concerned with questions of political significance, such as stability and debasement of currencies, war and peace, dynastic marriages, and worldwide trading monopolies, they became the financiers and financial advisers of governments. Moreover, since their relationships with governments were always in monetary terms and not real terms, and since they were always obsessed with the stability of monetary exchanges between one country's money and another, they used their power and influence to do two things: (1) to get all money and debts expressed in terms of a strictly limited commodity—ultimately gold; and (2) to get all monetary matters out of the control of governments and political au- thority, on the ground that they would be handled better by private bank- ing interests in terms of such a stable value as gold. These efforts failed with the shift of commercial capitalism into mercan- tilism and the destruction of the whole pattern of social organization based on dynastic monarchy, professional mercenary armies, and mercantilism, in the series of wars which shook Europe from the middle of the seven- teenth century to 1815. Commercial capitalism passed through two peri- ods of expansion each of which deteriorated into a later phase of war, class struggles, and retrogression. The first stage, associated with the Med- iterranean Sea, was dominated by the North Italians and Catalonians but ended in a phase of crisis after 1300, which was not finally ended until 1558. The second stage of commercial capitalism, which was associated with the Atlantic Ocean, was dominated by the West Iberians, the Netherlanders, and the English. It had begun to expand by 1440, was in full swing by 1600, but by the end of the seventeeth century had become entangled in the restrictive struggles of state mercantilism and the series of wars which ravaged Europe from 1667 to 1815. The commercial capitalism of the 1440-1815 period was marked by the supremacy of the Chartered Companies, such as the Hudson's Bay, the Dutch and British East Indian companies, the Virginia Company, and the\" Association of Merchant Adventurers (Muscovy Company). England's greatest rivals in all these activities were defeated by England's greater power, and, above all, its greater security derived from its insular position."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"48   TRAGEDY AND HOPE INDUSTRIAL CAPITALISM, I77O-185O Britain's victories over Louis XIV in the period 1667-1715 and over the French Revolutionary governments and Napoleon in 1792-1815 had many causes, such as its insular position, its ability to retain control of the sea, its ability to present itself to the world as the defender of the freedoms and rights of small nations and of diverse social and religious groups. Among these numerous causes, there were a financial one and an eco- nomic one. Financially, England had discovered the secret of credit. Economically. England had embarked on the Industrial Revolution. Credit had been known to the Italians and Netherlanders long before it became one of the instruments of English world supremacy. Nevertheless, the founding of the Bank of England by William Paterson and his friends in 1694 is one of the great dates in world history. For generations men had sought to avoid the one drawback of gold, its heaviness, by using pieces of paper to represent specific pieces of gold. Today we call such pieces of paper gold certificates. Such a certificate entitles its bearer to exchange it for its piece of gold on demand, but in view of the con- venience of paper, only a small fraction of certificate holders ever did make such demands. It early became clear that gold need be held on hand only to the amount needed to cover the fraction of certificates likely to be presented for payment; accordingly, the rest of the gold could be used for business purposes, or, what amounts to the same thing, a volume of certificates could be issued greater than the volume of gold reserved for payment of demands against them. Such an excess volume of paper claims against reserves we now call bank notes. In effect, this creation of paper claims greater than the reserves avail- able means that bankers were creating money out of nothing. The same thing could be done in another way, not by note-issuing banks but by deposit banks. Deposit bankers discovered that orders and checks drawn against deposits by depositors and given to third persons were often not cashed by the latter but were deposited to their own accounts. Thus there were no actual movements of funds, and payments were made simply by bookkeeping transactions on the accounts. Accordingly, it was necessary for the banker to keep on hand in actual money (gold, cer- tificates, and notes) no more than the fraction of deposits likely to be drawn upon and cashed; the rest could be used for loans, and if these loans were made by creating a deposit for the borrower, who in turn would draw checks upon it rather than withdraw it in money, such \"created deposits\" or loans could also be covered adequately by retaining reserves to only a fraction of their value. Such created deposits also were a creation of money out of nothing, although bankers usually refused to express their actions, either note issuing or deposit lending, in these terms. William Paterson, however, on obtaining the chatter of rhe Bank"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION TO I 9 I 4  49  of England in 1694, to use the moneys he had won in privateering, said, \"The Bank hath benefit of interest on all moneys which it creates out of nothing.\" This was repeated by Sir Edward Holden, founder of the Midland Bank, on December 18, 1907, and is, of course, generally ad- mitted today. This organizational structure for creating means of payment out of nothing, which we call credit, was not invented by England but was developed by her to become one of her chief weapons in the victory over Napoleon in 1815. The emperor, as the last great mercantilist, could not see money in any but concrete terms, and was convinced that his ef- forts to fight wars on the basis of \"sound money,\" by avoiding the crea- tion of credit, would ultimatelv win him a victory by bankrupting England. He was wrong, although the lesson has had to be relearned by modern financiers in the twentieth century. Britain's victory over Napoleon was also helped by two economic in- novations: the Agricultural Revolution, which was well established there in 1720, and the Industrial Revolution, which was equally well established there by 1776, when Watt patented his steam engine. The Industrial Revolution, like the Credit Revolution, has been much misunderstood, both at the time and since. This is unfortunate, as each of these has great significance, both to advanced and to underdeveloped countries, in the twentieth century. The Industrial Revolution was accompanied by a num- ber of incidental features, such as growth of cities through the factor)' system, the rapid growth of an unskilled labor supply (the proletariat), the reduction of labor to the status of a commodity in the competitive market, and the shifting of ownership of tools and equipment from laborers to a new social class of entrepreneurs. None of these constituted the essential feature of industrialism, which was, in fact, the application of nonliving power to the productive process. This application, sym- bolized in the steam engine and the water wheel, in the long run served to reduce or eliminate the relative significance of unskilled labor and the use of human or animal energy in the productive process (automation) and to disperse the productive process from cities, but did so, throughout, by intensifying the vital feature of the system, the use of energy from sources other than living bodies. In this continuing process, Britain's early achievement of industrialism gave it such great profits that these, combined with the profits derived earlier from commercial capitalism and the simultaneous profits derived from the unearned rise in land values from new cities and mines, made its early industrial enterprises largely self-financed or at least locally financed. Thcv were organized in proprietorships and partnerships, had contact with local deposit banks for short-term current loans, but had little to do with international bankers, investment banks, central gov- ernments, or corporative forms of business organization. This early stage of industrial capitalism, which lasted in England from"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"jO   TRAGEDY AND HOPE about 1770 to about 1850, was shared to some extent with Belgium and even France, but took quite different forms in the United States, Ger- many, and Italy, and almost totally different forms in Russia or Asia. The chief reason for these differences was the need for raising funds (capital) to pay for the rearrangement of the factors of production (land, labor, materials, skill, equipment, and so on) which industrialism required. Northwestern Europe, and above all England, had large savings for such new enterprises. Central Europe and North America had much less, while eastern and southern Europe had very little in private hands. The more difficulty an area had in mobilizing capital for industriali- zation, the more significant was the role of investment bankers and of governments in the industrial process. In fact, the early forms of in- dustrialism based on textiles, iron, coal, and steam spread so slowly from England to Europe that England was itself entering upon the next stage, financial capitalism, by the time Germany and the United States (about 1850) were just beginning to industrialize. This new stage of financial capitalism, which continued to dominate England, France, and the United States as late as 1930, was made necessary by the great mobiliza- tions of capital needed for railroad building after 1830. The capital needed for railroads, with their enormous expenditures on track and equipment, could not be raised from single proprietorships or partnerships or locally, but, instead, required a new form of enterprise—the limited-liability stock corporation—and a new source of funds—the international investment banker who had, until then, concentrated his attention almost entirely on international flotations of government bonds. The demands of rail- roads for equipment carried this same development, almost at once, into steel manufacturing and coal mining. FINANCIAL CAPITALISM, 185O-I93I This third stage of capitalism is of such overwhelming significance in the history of the twentieth century, and its ramifications and influences have been so subterranean and even occult, that we may be excused if we devote considerate attention to its organization and methods. Essen- tially what it did was to take the old disorganized and localized methods of handling money and credit and organize them into an integrated sys- tem, on an international basis, which worked with incredible and well- oiled facility for many decades. The center of that system was in London, with major offshoots in New York and Paris, and it has left, as its greatest achievement, an integrated banking system and a heavily capi- talized—if now largely obsolescent—framework of heavy industry, re- flected in railroads, steel mills, coal mines, and electrical utilities. This system had its center in London for four chief reasons. First"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION TO 1914  51  was the great volume of savings in England, resting on England's early successes in commercial and industrial capitalism. Second was England's oligarchic social structure (especially as reflected in its concentrated landownership and limited access to educational opportunities) which pro- vided a very inequitable distribution of incomes with large surpluses coming to the control of a small, energetic upper class. Third was the fact that this upper class was aristocratic but not noble, and thus, based on traditions rather than birth, was quite willing to recruit both monev and ability from lower levels of society and even from outside the coun- try, welcoming American heiresses and central-European Jews to its ranks, almost as willingly as it welcomed monied, able, and conformist recruits from the lower classes of Englishmen, whose disabilities from educational deprivation, provincialism, and Nonconformist (that is non- Anglican) religious background generally excluded them from the privi- leged aristocracy. Fourth (and by no means last) in significance was the skill in financial manipulation, especially on the international scene, which the small group of merchant bankers of London had acquired in the period of commercial and industrial capitalism and which lay ready for use when the need for financial capitalist innovation became urgent. The merchant bankers of London had already at hand in 1810-1850 the Stock Exchange, the Bank of England, and the London monev mar- ket when the needs of advancing industrialism called all of these into the industrial world which thev had hitherto ignored. In time they brought into their financial network the provincial banking centers, or- ganized as commercial banks and savings banks, as well as insurance companies, to form all of these into a single financial system on an inter- national scale which manipulated the quantity and flow of monev so that they were able to influence, if not control, governments on one side and industries on the other. The men who did this, looking backward toward the period of dynastic monarchy in which they had their own roots, aspired to establish dynasties of international bankers and were at least as successful at this as were many of the dynastic political rulers. The greatest of these dynasties, of course, were the descendants of Meyer Amschel Rothschild (1743—1811) of Frankfort, whose male descendants, for at least two generations, generally married first cousins or even nieces. Rothschild's five sons, established at branches in Vienna, London, Naples, and Paris, as well as Frankfort, cooperated together in ways which other international banking dynasties copied but rarely excelled. In concentrating, as we must, on the financial or economic activities of international bankers, we must not totally ignore their other attributes. They were, especially in later generations, cosmopolitan rather than nationalistic; they were a constant, if weakening, influence for peace, a pattern established in 1830 and 1840 when the Rothschilds threw their"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"52   TRAGEDY AND HOPE whole tremendous influence successfully against European wars. They were usuallv highly civilized, cultured gentlemen, patrons of education and of the arts, so that todav colleges, professorships, opera companies, symphonies, libraries, and museum collections still reflect their munifi- cence. For these purposes thev set a pattern of endowed foundations which still surround us today. The names of some of these banking families are familiar to all of us and should be more so. They include Baring, Lazard, Erlanger, Warburg, Schroder, Seligman, the Speyers, Mirabaud, Mallet, Fould, and above all Rothschild and Morgan. Even after these banking families became fully involved in domestic industry by the emergence of financial capi- talism, thev remained different from ordinary bankers in distinctive ways: (i) they were cosmopolitan and international; (z) they were close to governments and were particularly concerned with questions of gov- ernment debts, including foreign government debts, even in areas which seemed, at first glance, poor risks, like Egypt, Persia, Ottoman Turkey, Imperial China, and Latin America; (3) their interests were almost exclu- sively in bonds and very' rarely in goods, since they admired \"liquidity\" and regarded commitments in commodities or even real estate as the first step toward bankruptcy; (4) they were, accordingly, fanatical devo- tees of deflation (which they called \"sound\" money from its close associa- tions with high interest rates and a high value of money) and of the gold standard, which, in their eyes, symbolized and ensured these values; and (5) thev were almost equally devoted to secrecy and the secret use of financial influence in political life. These bankers came to be called \"in- ternational bankers\" and, more particularly, were known as \"merchant bankers\" in England, \"private bankers\" in France, and \"investment bank- ers\" in the United States. In all countries they carried on various kinds of banking and exchange activities, but everywhere they were sharply distinguishable from other, more obvious, kinds of banks, such as savings banks or commercial banks. One of their less obvious characteristics was that they remained as private unincorporated firms, usuallv partnerships, until relatively re- cently, offering no shares, no reports, and usually no advertising to the public. This risky status, which deprived them of limited liability, was retained, in most cases, until modern inheritance taxes made it essential to surround such family wealth with the immortality of corporate status for tax-avoidance purposes. This persistence as private firms con- tinued because it ensured the maximum of anonymity and secrecy to persons of tremendous public power who dreaded public knowledge of their activities as an evil almost as great as inflation. As a consequence, ordinary people had no way of knowing the wealth or areas of opera- tion of such firms, and often were somewhat hazy as to their member-"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION TO I 9 I 4  53  ship. Thus, people of considerable political knowledge might not asso- ciate the names Walter Burns, Clinton Dawkins, Edward Grenfell, Wil- >ard Straight, Thomas Larhont, Dwight Morrow, Nelson Perkins, Rus- sell Leffingwell, Elihu Root, John W. Davis, John Foster Dulles, and S. Parker Gilbert with the name \"Morgan,\" yet all these and many others Were parts of the system of influence which centered on the J. P. Morgan office at 2 3 Wall Street. This firm, like others of the international banking fraternity, constantly operated through corporations and governments, Vet remained itself an obscure private partnership until international finan- cial capitalism was passing from its deathbed to the grave. J. P. A4organ ar >d Company, original Iv founded in London as George Peabody and Company in 1838, was not incorporated until March 21, 1940, and went out of existence as a separate entity on April 24, 1959, when it merged with its most important commercial bank subsidiary, the Guaranty Trust Company. The London affiliate, Morgan Grenfell, was incorporated in '934^ and still exists. The influence of financial capitalism and of the international bankers who created it was exercised both on business and on governments, but could have done neither if it had not been able to persuade both these to accept two \"axioms\" of its own ideology. Both of these were based 0n the assumption that politicians were too weak and too subject to temporary popular pressures to be trusted with control of the monev system; accordingly, the sanctity of all values and the soundness of •noney must be protected in two ways: by basing the value of money on gold and by allowing bankers to control the supply of money. To do this it was necessary to conceal, or even to mislead, both governments and people about the nature of money and its methods of operation. For example, bankers called the process of establishing a monetary system on gold \"stabilization,\" and implied that this covered, as a sin- S'e consequence, stabilization of exchanges and stabilization of prices. *t really achieved only stabilization of exchanges, while its influence on Prices were quite independent and incidental, and might be unstabilizing (from its usual tendency to force prices downward by limiting the sup- ply of monev). As a consequence, many persons, including financiers and even economists, were astonished to discover, in the twentieth century, hat the gold standard gave stable exchanges and unstable prices. It had, however, already contributed to a similar, but less extreme, situation in h^uch of the nineteenth century. Exchanges were stabilized on the gold standard because by law, in Va nous countries, the monetary unit was made equal to a fixed quantity °r gold, and the two were made exchangeable at that legal ratio. In the P e riod before 1914, currency was stabilized in certain countries as fol- lows:"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"54  TRAGEDY AND HOPE In Britain: 77*. io l / 2 d. equaled a standard ounce (II/IZ pure gold). In the United States: $20.67 equaled a fine ounce (12/12 pure gold). In France: 3,447.74 francs equaled a fine kilogram of gold. In Germany: ->79° marks equaled a fine kilogram of gold. These relationships were established by the legal requirement that a person who brought gold, gold coins, or certificates to the public treasury (or other designated places) could convert any one of these into either of the others in unlimited amounts for no cost. As a result, on a full gold standard, gold had a unique position: it was, at the same time, in the sphere of money and in the sphere of wealth. In the sphere of money, the value of all other kinds of money was expressed in terms of gold: and, in the sphere of real wealth, the values of all other kinds of goods were expressed in terms of gold as money. If we regard the relationships be- tween money and goods as a seesaw in which each of these was at oppo- site ends, so that the value of one rose just as much as the value of the other declined, then we must see gold as the fulcrum of the seesaw on which this relationship balances, but which does not itself go up or down. Since it is quite impossible to understand the history of the twentieth century without some understanding of the role played bv money in domestic affairs and in foreign affairs, as well as the role played by bank- ers in economic life and in political life, we must take at least a glance at each of these four subjects. Domestic Financial Practices In each country the supply of money took the form of an inverted pyramid or cone balanced on its point. In the point was a supply of gold and its equivalent certificates; on the intermediate levels was a much larger supply of notes; and at the top, with an open and expandable upper sur- face, was an even greater supply of deposits. Each level used the levels below it as its reserves, and, since these lower levels had smaller quantities of money, they were \"sounder.\" A holder of claims on the middle or upper level could increase his confidence in his claims on wealth by reduc- ing them to a lower level, although, of course, if everyone, or any con- siderable number of persons, tried to do this at the same time the volume of reserves would be totally inadequate. Notes were issued by \"banks of emission\" or \"banks of issue,\" and were secured by reserves of gold or certificates held in their own coffers or in some central reserve. The fraction of such a note issue held in reserve depended upon custom, bank- ing regulations (including the terms of a bank's charter), or statute law. There were formerly many banks of issue, but this function is now generally restricted to a few or even to a single \"central bank\" in each country. Such banks, even central banks, were private institutions, owned"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION TO I914  55  by shareholders who profited by their operations. In the 1914-1939 period, m the United States, Federal Reserve Notes were covered by gold cer- tificates to 40 percent of their value, but this was reduced to 25 percent ln J945- The Bank of England, bv an Act of 1928, had its notes uncovered U P to /250 million, and covered by gold for 100 percent value over that amount. The Bank of France, in the same year, set its note cover at 35 percent. These provisions could always be set aside or changed in an emergency, such as war. Deposits on the upper level of the pyramid were called by this name, With typical bankers' ambiguity, in spite of the fact that they consisted or two utterly different kinds of relationships: (1) \"lodged deposits,\" which were real claims left by a depositor in a bank, on which the de- positor might receive interest, since such deposits were debts owed by he bank to the depositor; and (2) \"created deposits,\" which were claims created by the bank out of nothing as loans from the bank to \"depositors\" who had to pay interest on them, since these represented debt from them 0 the bank. In both cases, of course, checks could be drawn against such deposits to make payments to third parties, which is why both were Ca \"ed by the same name. Both form part of the money supply. Lodged deposits as a form of savings are deflationary, while created deposits, oeing an addition to the money supply, are inflationary. The volume of he latter depends on a number of factors of which the chief are the rate interest and the demand for such credit. These two play a very sig- nificant role in determining the volume of money in the community, since a large portion of that volume, in an advanced economic community, is made up of checks drawn against deposits. The volume of deposits banks can create, like the amount of notes they can issue, depends upon the v °'ume of reserves available to pav whatever fraction of checks are cashed father than deposited. These matters may be regulated by laws, by bank- ers rules, or simply bv local customs. In the United States deposits were r aditionallv limited to ten times reserves of notes and gold. In Britain it ' as usually nearer twenty times such reserves. In all countries the de- mand for and volume of such credit was larger in time of a boom and , ss in time of a depression. This to a considerable extent explains the \"tiationary aspect of a depression, the combination helping to form the ^-called ''business cycle.\" ln the course of the nineteenth century, with the full establishment of e gold standard and of the modern banking system, there grew up <r ound the fluctuating inverted pyramid of the money supply a plethora financial establishments which came to assume the configurations of a °iar system; that is, of a central bank surrounded by satellite financial in- 'tutions. m most countries the central bank was surrounded closely by e almost invisible private investment banking firms. These, like the P anet Mercury, could hardly be seen in the dazzle emitted by the central"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"$6   TRAGEDY AND HOPE bank which they, in fact, often dominated. Yet a close observer could hardly fail to notice the close private associations between these private, international bankers and the central bank itself. In France, for ex- ample, in 1936 when the Bank of France was reformed, its Board of Regents (directors) was still dominated by the names of the families who had originally set it up in 1800; to these had been added a few more recent names, such as Rothschild (added in 1819); in some cases the name might not be readily recognized because it was that of a son-in-law rather than that of a son. Otherwise, in 1914, the names, frequently those of Protestants of Swiss origin (who arrived in the eighteenth century) or of Jews of German origin (who arrived in the nineteenth century), had been much the same for more than a century. In England a somewhat similar situation existed, so that even in the middle of the twentieth century the Members of the Court of the Bank of England were chiefly associates of the various old \"merchant banking\" firms such as Baring Brothers, .Morgan Grenfell, Lazard Brothers, and others. In a secondary position, outside the central core, are the commercial banks, called in England the \"joint-stock banks,\" and on the Continent frequently known as \"deposit banks.\" These include such famous names as Midland Bank, Lloyd's Bank, Barclays Bank in England, the National City Bank in the United States, the Credit Lyonnais in France, and the Darmstadter Bank in Germany. Outside this secondary ring is a third, more peripheral, assemblage of institutions that have little financial power but do have the very sig- nificant function of mobilizing funds from the public. This includes a wide variety of savings banks, insurance firms, and trust companies. Naturally, these arrangements vary greatly from place to place, espe- cially as the division of banking functions and powers are not the same in all countries. In France and England the private bankers exercised their powers through the central bank and had much more influence on the government and on foreign policy and much less influence on industry, because in these two countries, unlike Germany, Italy, the United States, or Russia, private savings were sufficient to allow much of industry to finance itself without recourse either to bankers or government. In the United States much industry was financed by investment bankers directly, and the power of these both on industry and on government was very great, while the central bank (the New York Federal Reserve Bank) was established late (1913) and became powerful much later (after financial capitalism was passing from the scene). In Germany industry was financed and controlled by the discount banks, while the central bank was of little power or significance before 1914. In Russia the role of the government was dominant in much of economic life, while in Italy the situation was backward and complicated. J\\"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION TO 1914  57  We have said that two of the five factors which determined the value °f money (and thus the price level of goods) are the supply and the demand for money. The supply of money in a single country was subject to no centralized, responsible control in most countries over recent cen- turies. Instead, there were a variety of controls of which some could be mfluenced by bankers, some could be influenced by the government, and some could hardly be influenced by either. Thus, the various parts of the Pyramid of money were but loosely related to each other. Moreover, much of this looseness arose from the fact that the controls were com- pulsive in a deflationary direction and were only permissive in an infla- tionary direction. This last point can be seen in the fact that the supply of gold could be decreased but could hardly be increased. If an ounce of gold was added to the point of the pyramid in a system where law and custom allowed •o percent reserves on each level, it could permit an increase of deposits equivalent to $2067 on the uppermost level. If such an ounce of gold Were withdrawn from a fully expanded pyramid of money, this nxould compel a reduction of deposits by at least this amount, probably by a refusal to renew loans. 1 hroughout modern history the influence of the gold standard has been deflationary, because the natural output of gold each year, except in extraordinary times, has not kept pace with the increase in output of goods. Only new supplies of gold, or the suspension of the gold stand- ar d in wartime, or the development of new kinds of money (like notes a ud checks) which economize the use of gold, have saved our civilization 'torn steady price deflation over the last couple of centuries. As it was, Xv 'e had two long periods of such deflation from 1818 to 1850 and from '872 to about 1897. The three surrounding periods of inflation (1790- I ^ I 7' 1850-1872, 1897-1921) were caused by (1) the wars of the Stench Revolution and Napoleon when most countries were not on gold; (2) the new gold strikes of California and Alaska in 1849-1850, followed by a series of wars, which included the Crimean War of '854-1856, the Austrian-French War of 1859, the American Civil War 01 1861-1865, the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian wars of 1866 and ,8 7o, and even the Russo-Turkish War of 1877; and (3) the Klondike an d Transvaal gold strikes of the late 1890's, supplemented by the new c Vanide method of refining gold (about 1897) and the series of wars rf om the Spanish-American War of 1898-1899, the Boer War of 1899- \"902, and the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, to the almost uninter- rupted series of wars in the decade 1911-1921. In each case, the three great periods of war ended with an extreme deflationary crisis (1819, '873* 1921) as the influential Money Power persuaded governments to reestablish a deflationary monetary unit with a high gold content. The obsession of the Money Power with deflation was partly a result"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"58  TRAGEDY AND HOPE of their concern with money rather than with goods, but was also founded on other factors, one of which was paradoxical. The paradox arose from the fact that the basic economic conditions of the nineteenth century were deflationary, with a monev system based on gold and an industrial system pouring out increasing supplies of goods, but in spite of falling prices (with its increasing value of money) the interest rate tended to fall rather than to rise. This occurred because the relative limiting of the supply of money in business was not reflected in the world of finance where excess profits of finance made excess funds available for lending. .Moreover, the old traditions of merchant banking continued to prevail in financial capitalism even to its end in 1931. It continued to emphasize bonds rather than equity securities (stocks), to favor government issues rather than private offerings, and to look to foreign rather than to domestic investments. Until 1825, government bonds made up almost the whole of securities on the London Stock Exchange. In 1843, such bonds, usually foreign, were 80 percent of the securities registered, and in 1875 they were still 68 percent. The funds available for such loans were so great that there were, in the nineteentli century, sometimes riots by subscribers seeking opportunities to buy se- curity flotations; and offerings from many remote places and obscure activities commanded a ready sale. The excess of savings led to a fall in the price necessary to hire money, so that the interest rate on British gov- ernment bonds fell from 4.42 percent in 1820 to 3.11 in 1850 to 2.76 in 1900. This tended to drive savings into foreign fields where, on the whole, they continued to seek government issues and fixed interest securities. All this served to strengthen the merchant bankers' obsession both with gov- ernment influence and with deflation (which would increase value of money and interest rates). Another paradox of banking practice arose from the fact that bankers, who loved deflation, often acted in an inflationary fashion from their eagerness to lend money at interest. Since they make money out of loans, they are eager to increase the amounts of bank credit on loan. But this is inflationary. The conflict between the deflationary ideas and inflationary practices of bankers had profound repercussions on business. The bankers made loans to business so that the volume of monev in- creased faster than the increase in goods. The result was inflation. When this became clearly noticeable, the bankers would flee to notes or specie by curtailing credit and raising discount rates. This was beneficial to bankers in the short run (since it allowed them to foreclose on col- lateral held for loans), but it could be disastrous to them in the long run (by forcing the value of the collateral below the amount of the loans it secured). But such bankers' deflation was destructive to business and industry in the short run as well as the long run."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION' TO I 9 I 4  59  The resulting fluctuation in the supply of money, chiefly deposits, Was a prominent aspect of the \"business cycle.\" The quantity of money could be changed by changing reserve requirements or discount (in- terest) rates. In the United States, for example, an upper limit has been se t on deposits by requiring Federal Reserve member banks to keep a certain percentage of their deposits as reserves with the local Federal Reserve Hank. The percentage (usually from 7 to 26 percent) varies ^'ith the locality and the decisions of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Central banks can usuallv vary the amount of money in circulation \\ v \"open market operations\" or bv influencing the discount rates of lesser banks. In open market operations, a central bank buys or sells government bonds in the open market. If it buys, it releases money into ne economic system; if it sells it reduces the amount of money in the community. The change is greater than the price paid for the securities, or example, if the Federal Reserve Bank buys government securities ln the open market, it pays for these bv check which is soon deposited in •| hank. It thus increases this bank's reserves with the Federal Reserve Bank. Since banks are permitted to issue loans for several times the v alue of their reserves with the Federal Reserve Bank, such a transaction Permits them to issue loans for a much larger sum. Central banks can also change the quantity of money by influencing ne credit policies of other banks. This can be done by various methods, Such as changing the rediscount rate or changing reserve requirements. y changing the rediscount rate we mean the interest rate which central anks charge lesser banks for loans backed by commercial paper or other security which these lesser banks have taken in return for loans. } r raising the rediscount rate the central bank forces the lesser bank 0 raise its discount rate in order to operate at a profit; such a raise in fterest rates tends to reduce the demand for credit and thus the amount ot deposits (money). Lowering the rediscount rate permits an opposite result. Changing the reserve requirements as a method by which central anks can influence the credit policies of other banks is possible only in nose places (like the United States) where there is a statutory limit on serves. Increasing reserve requirements curtails the ability of lesser anks to grant credit, while decreasing it expands that ability. 't is to be noted that the control of the central bank over the credit policies of local banks are permissive in one direction and compulsive the other. They can compel these local banks to curtail credit and can nl y permit them to increase credit. This means that they have control Foyers against inflation and not deflation—a reflection of the old banking e a that inflation was bad and deflation was good."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"60   TRAGEDY AND HOPE The powers of governments over the quantity of money are of various kinds, and include (a) control over a central bank, (b) control over public taxation, and (c) control over public spending. The control of governments over central banks varies greatly from one country to iinother, but on the whole has been increasing. Since most central banks have been (technically) private institutions, this control is frequently based on custom rather than on law. In any case, the control over the supply of money which governments have through central banks is exercised by the regular banking procedures we have discussed. The powers of the government over the quantity of money in the community exercised through taxation and public spending are largely independent of banking control. Taxation tends to reduce the amount of money in a community and is usually a deflationary force; government spending tends to increase the amount of money in a community and is usually an inflationary force. The total effects of a government's policy will depend on which item is greater. An unbalanced budget will be in- flationary; a budget with a surplus will be deflationary. A government can also change the amount of money in a com- munity by other, more drastic, methods. By changing the gold content of the monetary unit they can change the amount of money in the community by a much greater amount. If, for example, the gold con- tent of the dollar is cut in half, the amount of gold certificates will be able to be doubled, and the amount of notes and deposits reared on this basis will be increased manyfold, depending on the customs of the community in respect to reserve requirements. Moreover, if a govern- ment goes off the gold standard completely—that is, refuses to exchange certificates and notes for specie—the amount of notes and deposits can be increased indefinitely because these are no longer limited by limited amounts of gold reserves. In the various actions which increase or decrease the supply of money, governments, bankers, and industrialists have not always seen eye to eye. On the whole, in the period up to 1931, bankers, especially the Money Power controlled by the international investment bankers, were able to dominate both business and government. They could dominate business, especially in activities and in areas where industry could not finance its own needs for capital, because investment bankers had the ability to supply or refuse to supply such capital. Thus, Rothschild in- terests came to dominate many of the railroads of Europe, while Morgan dominated at least 26,000 miles of American railroads. Such bankers went further than this. In return for notations of securities of industry, they took seats on the boards of directors of industrial firms, as they had already done on commercial banks, savings banks, insurance firms, and finance companies. From these lesser institutions they funneled capital"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION TO I 9 I 4  6l  to enterprises which yielded control and away from those who resisted. These firms were controlled through interlocking directorships, holding companies, and lesser banks. They engineered amalgamations and gen- erally reduced competition, until by the early twentieth centurv many activities were so monopolized that thev could raise their noncompeti- tive prices above costs to obtain sufficient profits to become self-financ- ln g and were thus able to eliminate the control of bankers. But before that stage was reached a relatively small number of bankers were in positions of immense influence in European and American economic \"ic As early as 1909, Walter Rathenau, who was in a position to know (since he had inherited from his father control of the German General Electric Company and held scores of directorships himself), said, \"Three hundred men, all of whom know one another, direct the economic destiny of Europe and choose their successors from among themselves.\" The power of investment bankers over governments rests on a num- oer of factors, of which the most significant, perhaps, is the need of governments to issue short-term treasury bills as well as long-term government bonds. Just as businessmen go to commercial banks for current capital advances to smooth over the discrepancies between their irregular and intermittent incomes and their periodic and persistent 0u tgoes (such as monthly rents, annual mortgage payments, and Weekly wages), so a government has to go to merchant bankers (or 'istitutions controlled by them) to tide over the shallow places caused ty irregular tax receipts. As experts in government bonds, the interna- 10r ial bankers not only handled the necessary advances but provided ad- Vlc e to government officials and, on many occasions, placed their own Members in official posts for varied periods to deal with special prob- erns. This is so widely accepted even today that in 1961 a Republican 'ivestment banker became Secretary of the Treasury in a Democratic Administration in Washington without significant comment from any direction. Naturally, the influence of bankers over governments during the age °' financial capitalism (roughly 1850-1931) was not something about Vv 'hich anyone talked freely, but it has been admitted frequently enough y those on the inside, especially in England. In 1852 Gladstone, chan- cellor of the Exchequer, declared, \"The hinge of the whole situation Vas this: the government itself was not to be a substantive power in Matters of Finance, but was to leave the Money Power supreme and ^questioned.\" On September 26, 1921, The Financial Times wrote, \" a 'f a dozen men at the top of the Big Five Banks could upset the hole fabric of government finance by refraining from renewing 'tute of Bankers, stated, \"The Governor of the Bank of England reasury Bills.\" In 1924 Sir Drummond Fraser, vice-president of the mstii"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"64   TRAGEDY AND HOPE There thus would be an increased supply of domestic money and an increased demand for that foreign money. As a result, importers would have to offer more of their money for these foreign bills, and the value of domestic money would fall, while the value of the foreign money would rise in the foreign-exchange market. This rise (or fall) on a gold relationship would be measured in terms of \"par\" (the exact gold content equivalent of the two currencies). As the value of the domestic currency sagged below par in relation- ship to that of some foreign currency, domestic exporters to that foreign country will increase their activities, because when they receive pay- ment in the form of a bill of exchange they can sell it for more of their own currency than they usuallv expect and can thus increase their profits. A surplus of imports, by lowering the foreign-exchange value of the importing country's money, will lead eventually to an increase in exports which, by providing more bills of exchange, will tend to re- store the relationship of the moneys back toward par. Such a restoration of parity in foreign exchange will reflect a restoration of balance in international obligations, and this in turn will reflect a restored balance in the exchange of goods and services between the two countries. This means, under normal conditions, that a trade disequilibrium will create trade conditions which will tend to restore trade equilibrium. When countries are not on the gold standard, this foreign-exchange disequilibrium (that is, the decline in the value of one monetary unit in relation to the other unit) can go on to very wide fluctuations—in fact, to whatever degree is necessary to restore the trade equilibrium by encouraging importers to buy in the other country because its money is so low in value that the prices of goods in that country are irresistible to importers in the other country. But when countries are on the gold standard, the result is quite differ- ent. In this case the value of a country's money will never go below the amount equal to the cost of shipping gold between the two coun- tries. An importer who wishes to pay his trade partner in the other country will not offer more and more of his own country's money for foreign-exchange bills, but will bid up the price of such bills only to the point where it becomes cheaper for him to buy gold from a bank and pay the costs of shipping and insurance on the gold as it goes to his foreign creditor. Thus, on the gold standard, foreign-exchange quotations do not fluctuate widely, but move only between the two gold points which are only slightly above (gold export point) and slightly below (gold import point) parity (the legal gold relationship of the two currencies). Since the cost of packing, shipping and insuring gold used to be about Y 2 percent of its value, the gold export and import points were about this amount above and below the parity point. In the case of the"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION' TO I 9 I 4  6$  dollar-pound relationship, when parity was at £ i ss $4,866, the gold export point was about $4,885 and the gold import point was about 54-845. Thus: Gold export point $4,885 (excess demand for bills by importers) Parity  $4,866  Gold import point $4,845 (excess supply of bills by exporters) The situation which we have described is overly simplified. In prac- t'ce the situation is made more complicated by several factors. Among these are the following: (1) middlemen buy and sell foreign exchange for present or future delivery as a speculative activity; (2) the total supply of foreign exchange available in the market depends on much more than the international exchange of commodities. It depends on the sum total °t all international payments, such as interest, payment for services, tourist spending, borrowings, sales of securities, immigrant remittances, ar >d so on; (3) the total exchange balance depends on the total of the relationships of all countries, not merely between two. The flow of gold from country to country resulting from unbalanced trade tends to create a situation which counteracts the flow. If a coun- try exports more than it imports so that gold flows in to cover the differ- ence, this gold will become the basis for an increased quantity of money, an d this will cause a rise of prices within the country sufficient to re- duce exports and increase imports. At the same time, the gold by flow- ln g out of some other country will reduce the quantity of money there a nd will cause a fall in prices within that country. These shifts in prices w ul cause shifts in the flow of goods because of the obvious fact that s°ods tend to flow to higher-priced areas and cease to flow to lower- priced areas. These shifts in the flow of goods will counteract the ri ginal unbalance in trade which caused the flow of gold. As a result, .e flow of gold will cease, and a balanced international trade at slightly lr rerent price levels will result. The whole process illustrates the u °ordination of internal price stability to stability of exchanges. It 'as this subordination which was rejected by most countries after 1931. his rejection was signified by (a) abandonment of the gold standard at eas t in part, (b) efforts at control of domestic prices, and (c) efforts exchange control. All these were done because of a desire to free the eonomic system from the restricting influence of a gold-dominated \"riancial system.

Because of these changes it became impossible to restore the financial system which had existed before 1914. Efforts to restore it were made with great determi- nation, but by 1933 they had obviously failed, and all major countries had been forced to abandon the gold standard and automatic exchanges. When the gold standard is abandoned, gold flows between countries like any other commodity, and the value of foreign exchanges (no longer tied to gold) can fluctuate much more widely. In theory an unbalance of international payments can be rectified either through a shift in ex- change rates or through a shift in internal price levels. On the gold standard this rectification is made by shifts in exchange rates only be- tween the gold points. When the unbalance is so great that exchanges would be forced beyond the gold points, the rectification is made by means of changing internal prices caused by the fact that gold flows at the gold points, instead of the exchanges passing beyond the gold points. On the other hand, when a currency is off the gold standard, fluctuation of exchanges is not confined between any two points but can go indefinitely in either direction. In such a case, the unbalance of international payments is worked out largely by a shift in exchange rates and only remotely by shifts in internal prices. In the period of 1929-1936, the countries of the world went off gold because they pre- ferred to bring their international balances toward equilibrium by means of fluctuating exchanges rather than by means of fluctuating price levels. They feared these last because changing (especially falling) prices led to declines in business activity and shifts in the utilization of economic resources (such as labor, land, and capital) from one activity to an- other. The reestablishment of the balance of international payments when a currency is off gold can be seen from an example. If the value of the pound sterling falls to $4.00 or S3.00, Americans will buy in England increasingly because English prices are cheap for them, but English- men will buy in America only with reluctance because they have to pay so much for American money. This will serve to rectify the original excess of exports to England which gave the great supply of pound sterling necessary to drive its value down to $3.00. Such a depre- ciation in the exchange value of a currency will cause a rise in prices within the country as a result of the increase in demand for the goods of that country. THE SITUATION BEFORE I9I4 The key to the world situation in the period before 1914 is to be found in the dominant position of Great Britain. This position was"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION TO I 9 I 4  6j  more real than apparent. In many fields (such as naval or financial) the supremacy of Britain was so complete that it almost never had to be declared by her or admitted by others. It was tacitly assumed by both. As an unchallenged ruler in these fields, Britain could afford to be a benevolent ruler. Sure of herself and of her position, she could be satis- fied with substance rather than forms. If others accepted her dominance m fact, she was quite willing to leave to them independence and autonomy in law. This supremacy of Britain was not an achievement of the nineteenth century alone. Its origins go back to the sixteenth century—to the period in which the discovery of America made the Atlantic more im- portant than the Mediterranean as a route of commerce and a road to health. In the Atlantic, Britain's position was unique, not merely be- cause of her westernmost position, but much more because she was an island. This last fact made it possible for her to watch Europe embroil itself in internal squabbles while she retained freedom to exploit the new worlds across the seas. On this basis, Britain had built up a naval supremacy which made her ruler of the seas by 1900. Along with this w as her preeminence in merchant shipping which gave her control of the avenues of world transportation and ownership of 39 percent of the World's oceangoing vessels (three times the number of her nearest rival). To her supremacy in these spheres, won in the period before 1815, Britain added new spheres of dominance in the period after 1815. These arose from her early achievement of the Industrial Revolution. This was applied to transportation and communications as well as to industrial Production. In the first it gave the world the railroad and the steamboat; \"i the second it gave the telegraph, the cable, and the telephone; in the mird it gave the factory system. The Industrial Revolution existed in Britain for almost two genera- >ons before it spread elsewhere. It gave a great increase in output of manufactured goods and a great demand for raw materials and food; it also gave a great increase in wealth and savings. As a result of the first Wo and the improved methods of transportation, Britain developed a World trade of which it was the center and which consisted chiefly of the ^port of manufactured goods and the import of raw materials and °od. At the same time, the savings of Britain tended to flow out to 0rt h America, South America, and Asia, seeking to increase the output raw materials and food in these areas. By 1914 these exports of ^pital had reached such an amount that they were greater than the 0r eign investments of all other countries put together. In 1914 British y erseas investment was about $20 billion (or about one-quarter of . r 'tain's national wealth, yielding about a tenth of the total national ln come). The French overseas investment at the same time was about"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"68  TRAGEDY AND HOPE $9 billion (or one-sixth the French national wealth, yielding 6 percent of the national income), while Germany had about $5 billion invested overseas (one-fifteenth the national wealth, yielding 3 percent of the national income). The United States at that time was a large-scale debtor. The dominant position of Britain in the world of 1913 was, as I have said, more real than apparent. In all parts of the world people slept more securely, worked more productively, and lived more fully because Britain existed. British naval vessels in the Indian Ocean and the Far East suppressed slave raiders, pirates, and headhunters. Small nations like Portugal, the Netherlands, or Belgium retained their overseas pos- sessions under the protection of the British fleet. Even the United States, without realizing it, remained secure and upheld the Monroe Doctrine behind the shield of the British Navy. Small nations were able to preserve their independence in the gaps between the Great Powers, kept in precarious balance bv the Foreign Office's rather diffident bal- ance-of-power tactics. Most of the world's great commercial markets, even in commodities like cotton, rubber, and tin, which she did not produce in quantities herself, were in England, the world price being set from the auction bidding of skilled specialist traders there. If a man in Peru wished to send money to a man in Afghanistan, the final pay- ment, as like as not, would be made by a bookkeeping transaction in London. The English parliamentary system and some aspects of the English judicial system, such as the rule of law, were being copied, as best as could be, in all parts of the world. The profitability of capital outside Britain—a fact which caused the great export of capital—was matched by a profitability of labor. As a result, the flow of capital from Britain and Europe was matched by a flow of persons. Both of these served to build up non-European areas on a modified European pattern. In export of men, as in export of capital, Britain was easily first (over 20 million persons emigrating from the United Kingdom in the period 1815-1938). As a result of both, Britain became the center of world finance as well as the center of world commerce. The system of international financial relations, which we described earlier, was based on the system of industrial, commercial, and credit relationships which we have just described. The former thus re- quired for its existence a very special group of circumstances—a group which could not be expected to continue forever. In addition, it required a group of secondary characteristics which were also far from perma- nent. Among these were the following: (1) all the countries concerned must be on the full gold standard; (1) there must be freedom from public or private interference with the domestic economy of any coun- try; that is, prices must be free to rise and fall in accordance with the supply and demand for both goods and monev; (3) there must also l>e"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION TO I 9 I 4  69  free flow of international trade so that both goods and money can go without hindrance to those areas where each is most valuable; (4) the international financial economy must be organized about one center with numerous subordinate centers, so that it would be possible to cancel out international claims against one another in some clearinghouse a nd thus reduce the flow of gold to a minimum; (5) the flow of goods and funds in international matters should be controlled by economic factors and not be subject to political, psychological, or ideological in- fluences. These conditions, which made the international financial and com- mercial system function so beautifully before 1914, had begun to change by 1890. The fundamental economic and commercial conditions changed first, and were noticeably modified by 1910; the group of secondary characteristics of the system were changed by the events of the First World War. As a result, the system of early international financial capitalism is now only a dim memory. Imagine a period with- out passports or visas, and with almost no immigration or customs restrictions. Certainly the system had many incidental drawbacks, but they ivere incidental. Socialized if not social, civilized if not cultured, the system allowed individuals to breathe freely and develop their individual talents in a way unknown before and in jeopardy since. The United States to 1917 Just as Classical culture spread westward from the Greeks who created K to the Roman peoples who adopted and changed it, so Europe's cul- ture spread westward to the New World, where it was profoundly Modified while still remaining basically European. The central fact of -American history is that people of European origin and culture came to occupy and use the immensely rich wilderness between the Atlantic and the Pacific. In this process the wilderness was developed and ex- ploited area by area, the Tidewater, the Piedmont, the trans-Ap- Palachian forest, the trans-Mississippi prairies, the Pacific Coast, and n ally the Great Plains. Bv 1900 the period of occupation which had )e gun in 1607 was finished, but the era of development continued on an 'ntensive rather than extensive basis. This shift from extensive to in- en sive development, frequently called the \"closing of the frontier,\" re- quired a readjustment of social outlook and behavior from a largely 'ndividualistic to a more cooperative basis and from an emphasis on lle re physical prowess to emphasis on other less tangible talents of man- serial skills, scientific training, and intellectual capacity able to fill the"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"70   TRAGEDY AND HOPE newly occupied frontiers with a denser population, producing a higher standard of living, and utilizing more extensive leisure. The ability of the people of the United States to make this readjust- ment of social outlook and behavior at the \"ending of the frontier\" about 1900 was hampered by a number of factors from its earlier historical experience. Among these we should mention the growth of sectionalism, past political and constitutional experiences, isolationism, and emphasis on physical prowess and unrealistic idealism. The occupation of the United States had given rise to three chief geographic sections: a commercial and later financial and industrial East, an agrarian and later industrial West, and an agrarian South. Un- fortunately, the two agrarian sections were organized quite differently, the South on the basis of slave labor and the West on the basis of free labor. On this question the East allied with the West to defeat the South in the Civil War (1861-1865) and to subject it to a prolonged military occupation as a conquered territory (1865-1877). Since the war and the occupation were controlled by the new Republican Party, the political organization of the country became split on a sectional basis: the South refused to vote Republican until 1928, and the West refused to vote Democratic until 1932. In the East the older families which in- clined toward the Republican Party because of the Civil War were largely submerged by waves of new immigrants from Europe, begin- ning with Irish and Germans after 1846 and continuing with even greater numbers from eastern Europe and Mediterranean Europe after 1890. These new immigrants of the eastern cities voted Democratic be- cause of religious, economic, and cultural opposition to the upper-class Republicans of the same eastern section. The class basis in voting patterns in the East and the sectional basis in voting in the South and West proved to be of major political significance after 1880. The Founding Fathers had assumed that the political control of the country would be conducted by men of property and leisure who would generally know each other personally and, facing no need for urgent decisions, would move government to action when they agreed and be able to prevent it from acting, without serious damage, when they could not agree. The American Constitution, with its provisions for division of powers and selection of the chief executive by an electoral college, reflected this point of view. So also did the use of the party caucus of legislative assemblies for nomination to public office and the election of senators by the same assemblies. The arrival of a mass democracy after 1830 changed this situation, establishing the use of party conventions for nominations and the use of entrenched political party machines, supported on the patronage of public office, to mobilize sufficient votes to elect their candidates. As a result of this situation, the elected official from 1840 to 1880"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION TO I 9 I 4  71  round himself under pressure from three directions: from the popular electorate which provided him with the votes necessarv for election, from the part}' machine which provided him with the nomination to run for office as well as the patronage appointments by which he could reward His followers, and from the wealthy economic interests which gave him the money for campaign expenses with, perhaps, a certain surplus for his own pocket. This was a fairlv workable svstem, since the three forces were approximatelv equal, the advantage, if any, resting with the party machine. This advantage became so great in the period 1865-1880 that the forces of finance, commerce, and industry were forced to contribute ever-increasing largesse to the political machines ln order to obtain the services from government which they regarded as their due, services such as higher tariffs, land grants to railroads, better Postal services, and mining or timber concessions. The fact that these rorces of finance and business were themselves growing in wealth and power made them increasingly restive under the need to make constantly larger contributions to party political machines. Moreover, these eco- nomic tycoons increasingly felt it to be unseemly that they should be unable to issue orders but instead have to negotiate as equals in order to obtain services or favors from partv bosses. \"V the late 1870's business leaders determined to make an end to this situation by cutting with one blow the taproot of the system of party machines, namely, the patronage svstem. This system, which they called by the derogatory term \"spoils svstem,\" was objectionable to big business not so much because it led to dishonestv or inefficiency but oecause it made the party machines independent of business control by giving them a source of income (campaign contributions from govern- ment employees) which was independent of business control. If this source could be cut off or even sensibly reduced, politicians would De much more dependent upon business contributions for campaign expenses. At a time when the growth of a mass press and of the use of chartered trains for political candidates were greatly increasing the ex pense of campaigning for office, anv reduction in campaign contribu- 10ns from officeholders would inevitably make politicians more sub- Sc rvient to business. It was with this aim in view that civil service er orm began in the Federal government with the Pendleton Bill of '°°3- As a result, the government was controlled with varying degrees , * completeness by the forces of investment banking and heavy indus- try from 1884 to 1933. this period, 1884-1933, was the period of financial capitalism in TUch investment bankers moving into commercial banking and in- urance on one side and into railroading and heavy industry on the tiler were able to mobilize enormous wealth and wield enormous ec onomic, political, and social power. Popularly known as \"Society,\""},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"72   TRAGEDY AND HOPE or the \"400,\" thev lived a life of dazzling splendor. Sailing the ocean in great private yachts or traveling on land bv private trains, they moved in a ceremonious round between their spectacular estates and town houses in Palm Beach, Long Island, the Berkshires, Newport, and Bar Harbor; assembling from their fortress-like New York residences to attend the Metropolitan Opera under the critical eye of Mrs. Astor; or gathering for business meetings of the highest strategic level in the awesome presence of J. P. Morgan himself. The structure of financial controls created by the tycoons of \"Big Banking\" and \"Big Business\" in the period 1880-1933 was of extraor- dinary complexity, one business fief being built on another, both being allied with semi-independent associates, the whole rearing upward into two pinnacles of economic and financial power, of which one, centered in New York, was headed bv J. P. Morgan and Company, and the other, in Ohio, was headed by the Rockefeller family. When these two co- operated, as they generally did, thev could influence the economic life of the country to a large degree and could almost control its political life, at least on the Federal level. The former point can be illustrated by a few facts. In the United States the number of billion-dollar cor- porations rose from one in 1909 (United States Steel, controlled by Mor- gan) to fifteen in 1930. The share of all corporation assets held by the 200 largest corporations rose from 32 percent in 1909 to 49 percent in 1930 and reached 57 percent in 1939. By 1930 these 200 largest corporations held 49.2 percent of the assets of all 40,000 corporations in the country ($81 billion out of $165 billion); they held 38 percent of all business wealth, incorporated or unincorporated (or $81 billion out of $212 bil- lion); and they held 22 percent of all the wealth in the country (or $81 billion out of $367 billion). In fact, in 1930, one corporation (American Telephone and Telegraph, controlled by Morgan) had greater assets than the total wealth in twenty-one states of the Union. The influence of these business leaders was so great that the Morgan and Rockefeller groups acting together, or even Morgan acting alone, could have wrecked the economic system of the country merely by throwing securities on the stock market for sale, and, having precipi- tated a stock-market panic, could then have bought back the securities they had sold but at a lower price. Naturally, they were not so foolish as to do this, although Morgan came very close to it in precipitating the \"panic of 1907,\" but they did not hesitate to wreck individual corpora- tions, at the expense of the holders of common stocks, by driving them to bankruptcy. In this way, to take only two examples, Morgan wrecked the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad before 1914 by selling to it, at high prices, the largely valueless securities of myriad New Eng- land steamship and trolley lines; and William Rockefeller and his friends wrecked the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul, and Pacific Railroad before"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION TO I 9 I 4  73  1925 bv selling to it, at excessive prices, plans to electrify to the Pacific, copper, electricity, and a worthless branch railroad (the Gary Line). These are but examples of the discovery by financial capitalists that they made money out of issuing and selling securities rather than out of the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and accordingly led them to the point where they discovered that the exploiting of an op- erating company by excessive issuance of securities or the issuance of bonds rather than equity securities not only was profitable to them but made it possible for them to increase their profits by bankruptcy of the firm, providing fees and commissions of reorganization as well as the op- portunity to issue new securities. When the business interests, led bv William C. Whitney, pushed through the first installment of civil service reform in 1883, they expected that they would be able to control both political parties equally. Indeed, some of them intended to contribute to both and to allow an alternation of the two parties in public office in order to conceal their own influ- er >ce, inhibit any exhibition of independence by politicians, and allow the electorate to believe that they were exercising their own free choice. Such an alternation of the parties on the Federal scene occurred in the Period 1880-1896, with business influence (or at least Morgan's influence) as great in Democratic as in Republican administrations. But in 1896 came a shocking experience. The business interests discovered that they could control the Republican Party to a large degree but could not be nearly so c °nfident of controlling the Democratic Party. The reason for this dif- erence lay in the existence of the Solid South as a Democratic section ^'ith almost no Republican voters. This section sent delegates to the Republican National Convention as did the rest of the country, but, mce these delegates did not represent voters, they came to represent /lose who were prepared to pay their expenses to the Republican National °nvention. In this way these delegates came to represent the busi- ess interests of the North, whose money they accepted. Mark Hanna as told us in detail how he spent much of the winter of 1895-1896 in e °rgia buying over two hundred delegates for McKinley to the Re- publican National Convention of 1896. As a result of this system, about quarter of the votes in a Republican Convention were \"controlled\" es from the Solid South, not representing the electorate. After the P Jt in the Republican Party in 1912, this portion of the delegates was uced to about 17 percent. ne inability of the investment bankers and their industrial allies to ntrol the Democratic Convention of 1896 was a result of the agrarian ^scontent of the period 1868-1896. This discontent in turn was based, r y largely, on the monetary tactics of the banking oligarchy. The bank- Were wedded to the gold standard for reasons we have already ex- P amed. Accordingly, at the end of the Civil War, they persuaded the"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"74  TRAGEDY AND HOPE Grant Administration to curb the postwar inflation and go back on the gold standard (crash of 1873 and resumption of specie payments in 1875). This gave the bankers a control of the supply of money which they did not hesitate to use for their own purposes, as Morgan ruthlessly pres- surized Cleveland in 1893—1896. The bankers' affection for low prices was not shared by the farmers, since each time prices of farm products went down the burden of farmers' debts (especially mortgages) became greater. Moreover, farm prices, being much more competitive than in- dustrial prices, and not protected by a tariff, fell much faster than in- dustrial prices, and farmers could not reduce costs or modify their pro- duction plans nearly so rapidlv as industrialists could. The result was a systematic exploitation of the agrarian sectors of the community by the financial and industrial sectors. This exploitation took the form of high industrial prices, high (and discriminatory) railroad rates, high interest charges, low farm prices, and a very low level of farm services by rail- roads and the government. Unable to resist by economic weapons, the farmers of the West turned to political relief, but were greatly hampered bv their reluctance to vote Democratic (because of their memories of the Civil War). Instead, thev tried to work on the state political level through local legislation (so-called Granger Laws) and set up third-party movements (like the Greenback Party in 1878 or the Populist Party in 1892). By 1896, however, agrarian discontent rose so high that it began to overcome the memory of the Democratic role in the Civil War. The capture of the Democratic Party by these forces of discontent under William Jennings Bryan in 1896, who was determined to obtain higher prices bv increasing the supply of money on a bimetallic rather than a gold basis, presented the electorate with an election on a social and economic issue for the first time in a generation. Though the forces of high finance and of big business were in a state of near panic, by a mighty effort in- volving large-scale spending they were successful in electing McKinley. The inability of plutocracy to control the Democratic Party as it had demonstrated it could control the Republican Party, made it advisable for them to adopt a one-party outlook on political affairs, although they continued to contribute to some extent to both parties and did not cease their efforts to control both. In fact on two occasions, in 1904 and in 1924, J. P. Morgan was able to sit back with a feeling of satisfaction to watch a presidential election in which the candidates of both parties were in his sphere of influence. In 1924 the Democratic candidate was one of his chief lawyers, while the Republican candidate was the classmate and handpicked choice of his partner, Dwight Morrow. Usually, Morgan had to share this political influence with other sectors of the business oli- garchy, especially with the Rockefeller interest (as was done, for ex- ample, by dividing the ticket between them in 1900 and in 1920). The agrarian discontent, the growth of monopolies, the oppression of"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION TO I 9 I 4  75  'abor, and the excesses of Wall Street financiers made the country very restless in the period 1890-1900. All this could have been alleviated merely by increasing the supply of money sufficiently to raise prices somewhat, but the financiers in this period, just as thirty vears later, were determined to defend the gold standard no matter what happened. In looking about tor some issue which would distract public discontent from domestic economic issues, what better solution than a crisis in foreign affairs? Cleve- 'and had stumbled upon this alternative, more or less accidentally, in 1895 when he stirred up a controversy with Great Britain over Venezuela. I he great opportunity, however, came with the Cuban revolt against ^>pain in 1895. While the \"yellow press,\" led by William Randolph Hearst, roused public opinion, Henrv Cabot Lodge and Theodore Roosevelt plotted how they could best get the United States into the fracas. They got the excuse thev needed when the American battleship Maine was sunk by a mysterious explosion in Havana harbor in February 1898. TO two months the United States declared war on Spain to fight for <-uban independence. The resulting victory revealed the United States as a world naval power, established it is an imperialist power with pos- session of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, whetted some ap- petites for imperialist glory, and covered the transition from the long- drawn age of semidepression to a new period of prosperity. This new period of prosperity was spurred to some extent by the increased demand tor industrial products arising from the war, but even more by the new period of rising prices associated with a considerable increase in the World production of gold from South Africa and Alaska after 1895. America's entrance upon the stage as a world power continued with the annexation of Hawaii in 1898, the intervention in the Boxer uprising >n 1900, the seizure of Panama in 1903, the diplomatic intervention in the Husso-Japanese War in 1905, the round-the-world cruise of the American JNavy in 1008, the military occupation of Nicaragua in 1912, the open- ln g of the Panama Canal in 1914, and military intervention in Mexico ir > 1916. During this same period, there appeared a new movement for economic •Hid political reform known as Progressivism. The Progressive movement resulted from a combination of forces, some new and some old. Its foun- dation rested on the remains of agrarian and labor discontent which had stru ggled so vainly before 1897. There was also, as a kind of afterthought °n the part of successful business leaders, a weakening of acquisitive selfishness and a revival of the older sense of social obligation and idealism. 1 o some extent this feeling was mixed with a realization that the position and privileges of the verv wealthy could be preserved better with super- nal concessions and increased opportunity for the discontented to blow °tt steam than from any policy of blind obstructionism on the part of the ric n. As an example of the more idealistic impulse we might mention the"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"76  TRAGEDY AND HOPE creation of the various Carnegie foundations to work for universal peace or to extend scholarly work in science and social studies. As an example of the more practical point of view we might mention the founding of The New Republic, a \"liberal weekly paper,\" by an agent of Morgan financed with Whitney money (1914). Somewhat similar to this last point was the growth of a new \"liberal press,\" which found it profitable to print the writings of \"muckrakers,\" and thus expose to the public eye the seamy side of Big Business and of human nature itself. But the great opportunity for the Progressive forces arose from a split within Big Busi- ness between the older forces of financial capitalism led by Morgan and the newer forces of monopoly capitalism organized around the Rocke- feller bloc. As a consequence, the Republican Party was split between the followers of Theodore Roosevelt and those of William Howard Taft, so that the combined forces of the liberal East and the agrarian West were able to capture the Presidency under Woodrow Wilson in 1912. Wilson roused a good deal of popular enthusiasm with his talk of \"New Freedom\" and the rights of the underdog, but his program amounted to little more than an attempt to establish on a Federal basis those reforms which agrarian and labor discontent had been seeking on a state basis for many years. Wilson was by no means a radical (after all, he had been accepting money for his personal income from rich industrialists like Cleveland Dodge and Cyrus Hall McCormick during his professorship at Princeton, and this kind of thing bv no means ceased when he entered politics in 1910), and there was a good deal of unconscious hypocrisy in many of his resounding public speeches. Be this as it may, his politi- cal and administrative reforms were a good deal more effective than his economic or social reforms. The Clayton Antitrust Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act (1913) were soon tightly wrapped in litigation and futility. On the other hand, the direct election of senators, the establishment of an income tax and of the Federal Reserve System, and the creation of a Federal Farm Loan System (1916) and of rural delivery of mail and parcel post, as well as the first steps toward various laboring enactments, like minimum wages for merchant seamen, restrictions on child labor, and an eight-hour day for railroad workers, justified the support which Progressives had given to Wilson. The first Administration of Wilson (1913-1917) and the earlier Admin- istration of Theodore Roosevelt (1901-1909) made a substantial contri- bution to the process by which the United States redirected its aim from extensive expansion of physical frontiers to an intensive exploitation of its natural and moral resources. The earlier Roosevelt used his genius as a showman to publicize the need to conserve the country's natural re- sources, while Wilson, in his own professorial fashion, did much to ex- tend equality of opportunity to wider groups of the American people. These people were so absorbed in the controversies engendered by these"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"WESTERN CIVILIZATION TO I 9 I 4  77  efforts that they hardly noticed the rising international tensions in Europe or even the outbreak of war in August, 1914, until by 1915 the clamorous controversy of the threat of war quite eclipsed the older domestic con- troversies. By the end of 1915 America was being summoned, in no gentle fashion, to play a role on the world's stage. This is a story to which we must return in a later chapter."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Ill THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE TO 1917"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"I N the nineteenth century most historians regarded Russia as part of Europe but it is now becoming increasingly clear that Russia is an- other civilization quite separate from Western Civilization. Both of nese civilizations are descended from Classical Civilization, but the con- nection with this predecessor was made so differently that two quite 1 erent traditions came into existence. Russian traditions were derived rom B yzantium directly; Western traditions were derived from the roore moderate Classical Civilization indirectly, having passed through e Dark Ages when there was no state or government in the West. Kussian civilization was created from three sources originally: (i) the t av P eo ple, (2) Viking invaders from the north, and (3) the Byzantine ra ltion from the south. These three were fused together as the result a common experience arising from Russia's exposed geographical posi- ] on on the western edge of a great flatland stretching for thousands of n^es to the east. This flatland is divided horizontally into three zones £ ^' hlcn the most southern is open plain, while the most northern is open and tundra. The middle zone is forest. The southern zone (or e ppes) consists of two parts: the southern is a salty plain which is prac- bl 3 h USe * ess ' w hile the northern part, next to the forest, is the famous -earth re g' on of rich agricultural soil.

These North- men were trying to make a way of life out of militarism, seizing booty and slaves, imposing tribute on conquered peoples, collecting furs, honey, and wax from the timid Slavs lurking in their forests, and exchanging these for the colorful products of the Byzantine south. In time the Northmen set up fortified trading posts along their river highways, notably at Novgorod in the north, at Smolensk in the center, and at Kiev in the south. They married Slav women and imposed on the rudi- mentary agricultural-hunting economy of the Slavs a superstructure of a tribute-collecting state with an exploitative, militaristic, commercial econ- omy. This created the pattern of a two-class Russian society which has continued ever since, much intensified by subsequent historical events. In time the ruling class of Russia became acquainted with Byzantine culture. They were dazzled by it, and sought to import it into their wilderness domains in the north. In this way they imposed on the Slav peoples many of the accessories of the Byzantine Empire, such as Ortho- dox Christianity, the Byzantine alphabet, the Byzantine calendar, the used of domed ecclesiastical architecture, the name Czar (Caesar) for their ruler, and innumerable other traits. .Most important of all, they imported the Byzantine totalitarian autocracy, under which all aspects of life, including political, economic, intellectual, and religious, were re- garded as departments of government, under the control of an autocratic ruler. These beliefs were part of the Greek tradition, and were based ultimately on Greek inability to distinguish between state and society. Since society includes all human activities, the Greeks had assumed that the state must include all human activities. In the days of Classical Greece this all-inclusive entity was called the polis, a term which meant both society and state; in the later Roman period this all-inclusive entity was called the imperium. The only difference was that the polis was sometimes (as in Pericles's Athens about 450 B.C.) democratic, while the iviperimn was always a military autocracy. Both were totalitarian, so that religion and economic life were regarded as spheres of governmental activity. This totalitarian autocratic tradition was carried on to the Byzantine Empire and passed from it to the Russian state in the north and to the later Ottoman Empire in the south. In the north this Byzantine tradition com- bined with the experience of the Northmen to intensify the two-class structure of Slav society. In the new Slav (or Orthodox) Civilization this fusion, fitting together the Byzantine tradition and the Viking tradition, created Russia. From Byzantium came autocracy and the idea of the state as an absolute power and as a totalitarian power, as well as such impor- tant applications of these principles as the idea that the state should control thought and religion, that the Church should be a branch of the govern- ment, that law is an enactment of the state, and that the ruler is semi- divine. From the Vikings came the idea that the state is a foreign"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE TO 1917  83  importation, based on militarism and supported by booty and tribute, that economic innovations are the function of the government, that power rather than law is the basis of social life, and that society, with its people and its property, is the private property of a foreign ruler. These concepts of the Russian system must be emphasized because they are so foreign to our own traditions. In the West, the Roman Empire (which continued in the East as the Byzantine Empire) disappeared in 47°; and, although many efforts were made to revive it, there was clearly a P cn od, about 900, when there was no empire, no state, and no public authority in the West. The state disappeared, vet society continued. So ' so ' re ligious and economic life continued. This clearly showed that the • ate and society were not the same thing, that society was the basic entity, and that the state was a crowning, but not essential, cap to the °cial structure. This experience had revolutionary effects. It was dis- covered that man can live without a state; this became the basis of Western liberalism. It was discovered that the state, if it exists, must er ve men and that it is incorrect to believe that the purpose of men is 0 ser ve the state. It was discovered that economic life, religious life, law, private property can all exist and function effectively without a state, om this emerged laissez-faire, separation of Church and State, rule of v > and the sanctity of private property. In Rome, in Byzantium, and in ssia, law was regarded as an enactment of a supreme power. In the est, when no supreme power existed, it was discovered that law still sted as the body of rules which govern social life.

In this way the world of space and time, which God had made at the beginning with the statement, \"It was good\" (Book of Genesis), would, at the end, be restored to its original condition. This optimistic, \"this-worldly\" religion was taken into Classical Civili- zation at a time when the philosophic outlook of that society was quite incompatible with the religious outlook of Christianity. The Classical philosophic outlook, which we might call Neoplatonic, was derived from the teachings of Persian Zoroastrianism, Pythagorean rationalism, and Platonism. It was dualistic, dividing the universe into two opposed worlds, the world of matter and flesh and the world of spirit and ideas. The former world was changeable, unknowable, illusionarv, and evil; the latter world was eternal, knowable, real, and good. Truth, to these people, could be found by the use of reason and logic alone, not by use of the body or the senses, since these were prone to error, and must be spurned. The body, as Plato said, was the \"tomb of the soul.\" ' Thus the Classical w ? orld into which Christianity came about A.D. 60 believed that the world and the body were unreal, unknowable, corrupt, and hopeless and that no truth or success could be found by the use of the body, the senses, or matter. A small minority, derived from Democ- ritus and the early Ionian scientists through Aristotle, Epicurus, and Lucretius, rejected the Platonic dualism, preferring materialism as an explanation of reality. These materialists were equally incompatible with the new Christian religion. Moreover, even the ordinary citizen of Rome had an outlook whose implications were not compatible with the Chris- tian religion. To give one simple example: while the Christians spoke of a millennium in the future, the average Roman continued to think of a \"Golden Age\" in the past, just as Homer had. As a consequence of the fact that Christian religion came into a society with an incompatible philosophic outlook, the Christian religion was ravaged by theological and dogmatic disputes and shot through with \"otherworldly\" heresies. In general, these heresies felt that God was so perfect and so remote and man was so imperfect and such a worm that the gap between God and man could not be bridged by any act or man, that salvation depended on grace rather than on good works, and that, if God ever did so lower Himself as to occupy a human body, this was not an ordinary body, and that, accordingly, Christ could be either"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE TO I 9 I 7  85  True God or True Alan but could not be both. This point of view was opposed by the -Christian Fathers of the Church, not always suc- cessfully; but in the decisive battle, at the first Church Council, held at i>icaea in 325, the Christian point of view was enacted into the formal dogma of the Church. Although the Church continued to exist for cen- turies thereafter in a society whose philosophic outlook was ill adapted to me Christian religion, and obtained a compatible philosophy only in the medieval period, the basic outlook of Christianity reinforced the experience of the Dark Ages to create the outlook of Western Civiliza- t'on. Some of the elements of this outlook which were of great im- portance were the following: (1) the importance of the individual, s mce he alone is saved; (2) the potential goodness of the material world a nd of the body; (3) the need to seek salvation by use of the body and the senses in this world (good works); (4) faith in the reliability of the senses (which contributed much to Western science); (5) faith in the reality of ideas (which contributed much to Western mathematics); (6) °iundane optimism and millennianism (which contributed much to faith \"1 the future and the idea of progress); (7) the belief that God (and not the devil) reigns over this world by a system of established rules (which contributed much to the ideas of natural law, natural science, and the rule of law). These ideas which became part of the tradition of the West did not De come part of the tradition of Russia. The influence of Greek philo- sophic thought remained strong in the East. The Latin West before 900 Us ed a language which was not, at that time, fitted for abstract dis- cussion, and almost all the dogmatic debates which arose from the in- compatibility of Greek philosophy and Christian religion were carried °n in the Greek language and fed on the Greek philosophic tradition. In the West the Latin language reflected a quite different tradition, based on tne Roman emphasis on administrative procedures and ethical ideas about human behavior to one's fellow man. As a result, the Greek philosophic tradition remained strong in the East, continued to permeate the Greek- s Peaking Church, and went with that Church into the Slavic north. *he schism between the Latin Church and the Greek Church strength- ened their different points of view, the former being more this-worldly, ^ore concerned with human behavior, and continuing to believe in the efficacy of good works, while the latter was more otherworldly, more concerned with God's majesty and power, and emphasized the evilness and weakness of the body and the world and the efficacy of God's grace. As a result, the religious outlook and, accordingly, the world outlook °f Slav religion and philosophy developed in quite a different direction tr °m that in the West.

To this point we have seen the Slavs formed into Russian civilization as the result of several factors. Before we go on we should, perhaps, re- capitulate. The Slavs were subjected at first to the Viking exploitative system. These Vikings copied Byzantine culture, and did it very con- sciously, in their religion, in their writing, in their state, in their laws, in art, architecture, philosophy, and literature. These rulers were outsiders who innovated all the political, religious, economic, and intellectual life of the new civilization. There was no state: foreigners brought one in. There was no organized religion: one was imported from Byzantium and imposed on the Slavs. The Slav economic life was on a low level, a forest subsistence economy with hunting and rudimentary agriculture: on this the Vikings imposed an international trading system. There was no reli- gious-philosophic outlook: the new State-Church superstructure imposed on the Slavs an outlook derived from Greek dualistic idealism. And, finally, the East never experienced a Dark Ages to show it that society is distinct from the state and more fundamental than the state. This summary brines Russian society down to about 1200. In the next six hundred years new experiences merely intensified the Russian develop- ment. These experiences arose from the fact that the new Russian society found itself caught between the population pressures of the raiders from the steppes to the east and the pressure of the advancing technology of Western Civilization. The pressure of the Ural-Altaic speakers from the eastern steppes culminated in the Mongol (Tarter) invasions after 1200. The Mongols conquered Russia and established a tribute-gathering system which con- tinued for generations. Thus there continued to be a foreign exploiting system imposed over the Slav people. In time the Mongols made the princes of Moscow their chief tribute collectors for most of Russia. A little later the Mongols made a court of highest appeal in Moscow, so that both money and judicial cases flowed to Moscow. These continued to flow even after the princes of Moscow (1380) led the successful re- volt which ejected the Mongols. As the population pressure from the East decreased, the technological pressure from the West increased (after 1500). By Western technology we mean such things as gunpowder and firearms, better agriculture, counting and public finance, sanitation, printing, and the spread of educa- tion. Russia did not get the full impact of these pressures until late, and then from secondary sources, such as Sweden and Poland, rather than from England or France. However, Russia was hammered out between the pressures from the East and those from the West. The result of this hammering was the Russian autocracy, a military, tribute-gathering ma- chine superimposed on the Slav population. The poverty of this popu-"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE TO I 9 I 7  87  'ation made it impossible for them to get firearms or any other advan- tages of Western technology. Onlv the state had these things, but the state could afford them only by draining wealth from the people. This draining of wealth from below upward provided arms and Western tech- nology for the rulers but kept the ruled too poor to obtain these things, so that all power was concentrated at the top. The continued pressure from the West made it impossible for the rulers to use the wealth that accumulated in their hands to finance economic improvements which m 'ght have raised the standards of living of the ruled, since this accumu- lation had to be used to increase Russian power rather than Russian Wealth. As a consequence, pressure downward increased and the autocracy became more autocratic. In order to get a bureaucracy for the army and tor government service, the landlords were given personal powers over tn e peasants, creating a system of serfdom in the East just at the time th at medieval serfdom was disappearing in the West. Private property, Personal freedom, and direct contact with the state (for taxation or for justice) were lost to the Russian serfs. The landlords were given these powers so that the landlords would be free to fight and willing to fight or Moscow or to serve in Moscow's autocracy. , v 1730 the direct pressure of the West upon Russia began to weaken °mewhat because of the decline of Sweden, of Poland, and of Turkey, \\'nile Prussia was too occupied with Austria and with France to press rer V forcibly on Russia. Thus, the Slavs, using an adopted Western tech- ology 0 f a rudimentary character, were able to impose their supremacy n th - e peoples to the East. The peasants of Russia, seeking to escape from e pressures of serfdom in the area west of the Urals, began to flee -'Stward, and eventually reached the Pacific. The Russian state made cr y effort to stop this movement because it felt that the peasants must \"fain to work the land and pay taxes if the landlords were to be able maintain the military autocracy which was considered necessary. Even- a . v the autocracy followed the peasants eastward, and Russian society an ie to occupy the whole of northern Asia. s the pressure from the East and the pressure from the West declined, autocracy, inspired perhaps by powerful religious feelings, began to a bad conscience toward its own people. At the same time it still to westernize itself.

This meant, very specifically,"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"88  TRAGEDY AND HOPE that Russia had to obtain the Agricultural Revolution and industrialism; but these in turn required that ability to read and write be extended to the peasants and that the rural population be reduced and the urban popula- tion be increased. These needs, again, meant that serfdom had to be abolished and that modern sanitation had to be introduced. Thus one need led to another, so that the whole society had to be reformed. In typically Russian fashion all these things were undertaken by government action, but as one reform led to another it became a question whether the autoc- racy and the landed upper classes would be willing to allow the reform movement to go so far as to jeopardize their power and privileges. For example, the abolition of serfdom made it necessary for the landed nobility to cease to regard the peasants as private property whose only contact with the state was through themselves. Similarly, industrialism and urbanism would create new social classes of bourgeoisie and work- ers. These new classes inevitably would make political and social de- mands very distasteful to the autocracy and the landed nobility. If the reforms led to demands for nationalism, how could a dynastic monarchy such as the Romanov autocracy yield to such demands without risking the loss of Finland, Poland, the Ukraine, or Armenia? As long as the desire to westernize and the bad conscience of the upper classes worked together, reform advanced. But as soon as the lower classes began to make demands, reaction appeared. On this basis the history of Russia was an alternation of reform and reaction from the eighteenth century to the Revolution of 1917. Peter the Great (1689- 1725) and Catherine the Great (1762-1796) were supporters of westerni- zation and reform. Paul I (1796-1801) was a reactionary. Alexander I (1801-1825) and Alexander II (1855-1881) were reformers, while Nicho- las I (1825-1855) and Alexander III (1881-1894) were reactionaries. As a consequence of these various activities, by 1864 serfdom had been abolished, and a fairly modern system of law, of justice, and of educa- tion had been established; local government had been somewhat mod- ernized; a fairlv good financial and fiscal system had been established; and an army based on universal military service (but lacking in equip- ment) had been created. On the other hand, the autocracy continued, with full power in the hands of weak men, subject to all kinds of personal intrigues of the basest kind; the freed serfs had no adequate lands; the newly literate were subject to a ruthless censorship which tried to control their reading, writing, and thinking; the newly freed and newly urbanized were subject to constant police supervision; the non-Russian peoples of the empire were subjected to waves of Russification and Pan- Slavism; the judicial system and the fiscal system were administered with an arbitrary disregard of all personal rights or equity; and, in general, the autocracy was both tyrannical and weak. The first period of reform in the nineteenth century, that under Alex-"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE TO I 9 I 7  89  ander I, resulted from a fusion of two factors: the \"conscience-stricken gentry\" and the westernizing autocracy. Alexander himself represented both factors. As a result of his reforms and those of his grandmother, Catherine the Great, even earlier, there appeared in Russia, for the first tlr ne, a new educated class which was wider than the gentry, being re- cruited from sons of Orthodox priests or of state officials (including ar my officers) and, in general, from the fringes of the autocracy and the gentry. When the autocracy became reactionary under Nicholas I, this newly educated group, with some support from the conscience-stricken gentry, formed a revolutionary group generally called the \"Intelligentsia.\" At first this new group was pro-Western, but later it became increasingly anti-Western and \"Slavophile\" because of its disillusionment with the West. In general, the Westernizers argued that Russia was merely a backward and barbaric fringe of Western Civilization, that it had made 00 cultural contribution of its own in its past, and that it must pass through the same economic, political, and social developments as the West. The Westernizers wished to speed up these developments. The Slavophiles insisted that Russia was an entirely different civiliza- tion from Western Civilization and was much superior because it had a profound spirituality (as contrasted with Western materialism), it had a Jce P irrationality in intimate touch with vital forces and simple living virtues (in contrast to Western rationality, artificiality, and hypocrisy), it had its own native form of social organization, the peasant village (commune) providing a fully satisfying social and emotional life (in contrast to Western frustration of atomistic individualism in sordid cities); and that a Socialist society could be built in Russia out of the simple self-governing, cooperative peasant commune without any need t0 pass along the Western route marked by industrialism, bourgeoisie supremacy, or parliamentary democracy. As industrialism grew in the West, in the period 1830-1850, the Rus- sian Westernizers like P. Y. Chaadayev (1793-1856) and Alexander Merzen (1812-1870) became increasingly disillusioned with the West, especially with its urban slums, factory system, social disorganization, Middle-class money-grubbing and pettiness, its absolutist state, and its _vanced weapons. Originally the Westernizers in Russia had been in- spired by French thinkers, while the Slavophiles had been inspired by German thinkers like Schelling and Hegel, so that the shift from West- er uizers to Slavophiles marked a shift from French to Germanic teachers. The Slavophiles supported orthodoxy and monarchy, although they verc very critical of the existing Orthodox Church and of the existing au tocracy. They claimed that the latter was a Germanic importation, and lat the former, instead of remaining a native organic growth of Slavic spirituality, had become little more than a tool of autocracy. Instead of Su Pporting these institutions, many Slavophiles went out into the villages"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"90  TRAGEDY AND HOPE to get in touch with pure Slavic spirituality and virtue in the shape of the untutored peasant. These missionaries, called \"narodniki,\" were greeted with unconcealed suspicion and distaste by the peasants, because they were city-bred strangers, were educated, and expressed anti-Church and antigovernmental ideas. Already disillusioned with the West, the Church, and the government, and now rejected bv the peasants, the Intelligentsia could find no social group on which to base a reform program. The result was the growth of nihilism and of anarchism. Nihilism was a rejection of all conventions in the name of individual- ism, both of these concepts understood in a Russian sense. Since man is a man and not an animal because of his individual development and growth in a society made up of conventions, the nihilist rejection of conventions served to destroy man rather than to liberate him as they expected. The destruction of conventions would not raise man to be an angel, but would lower him to be an animal. Moreover, the individual that the nihilists sought to liberate bv this destruction of conventions was not what Western culture understands bv the word \"individual.\" Rather it was \"humanity.\" The nihilists had no respect whatever for the concrete individual or for individual personality. Rather, by destroying all conven- tions and stripping all persons naked of all conventional distinctions, they hoped to sink everyone, and especially themselves, into the amorphous, indistinguishable mass of humanity. The nihilists were completely atheist, materialist, irrational, doctrinaire, despotic, and violent. They rejected all thought of self so long as humanity suffered; they \"became atheists be- cause they could not accept a Creator Who made an evil, incomplete world full of suffering\"; they rejected all thought, all art, all idealism, all conventions, because these were superficial, unnecessary luxuries and therefore evil; they rejected marriage, because it was conventional bond- age on the freedom of love; they rejected private property, because it was a tool of individual oppression; some even rejected clothing as a corruption of natural innocence; they rejected vice and licentiousness as unnecessary upper-class luxuries; as Nikolai Berdyaev put it: \"It is Orthodox asceticism turned inside out, and asceticism without Grace. At the base of Russian nihilism, when grasped in its purity and depth, lies the Orthodox rejection of the world . . . , the acknowledgment of the sinfulness of all riches and luxury, of all creative profusion in art and in thought. . . . Nihilism considers as sinful luxury not onlv art, metaphysics, and spiritual values, but religion also. . . . Nihilism is a demand for naked- ness, for the stripping of oneself of all the trappings of culture, for the annihilation of all historical traditions, for the setting free of the natural man, . . . The intellectual asceticism of nihilism found expression in materialism; any more subtle philosophy was proclaimed a sin. . . . Not to be a materialist was to be taken as a moral suspect. If you were not"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE TO I 9 I 7  QI  a materialist, then you were in favour of the enslavement of man hoth intellectually and politically.\" * This fantastic philosophy is of great significance because it prepared me ground for Bolshevism. Out of the same spiritual sickness which produced nihilism emerged anarchism. To the anarchist, as revealed by the founder of the movement, .Mikhail Bakunin (1814—1876), the chief of all enslaving and needless conventionalities was the state. The discoverv mat the state was not identical with societv, a discoverv which the West nad made a thousand years earlier than Russia, could have been a liberat- ln g discovery to Russia if, like the West, the Russians had been willing to accept both state and society, each in its proper place. But this was quite impossible in the Russian tradition of fanatical totalitarianism. To mis tradition the totalitarian state had been found evil and must, accord- ingly, be competely destroyed, and replaced by the totalitarian society m which the individual could be absorbed. Anarchism was the next ste P after the disillusionment of the narodniki and the agitations of the nihilists. The revolutionary Intelligentsia, unable to find any social group 011 w hich to base a reform program, and convinced of the evil of all conventional establishments and of the latent perfection in the Russian masses, adopted a program of pure political direct action of the simplest kind: assassination. Merely by killing the leaders of states (not only in Russia but throughout the world), governments could be eliminated and !c masses freed for social cooperation and agrarian Socialism. From this background came the assassination of Czar Alexander II in 1881, of ^ ln g Humbert of Italy in 1900, of President AlcKinley in 1901, as well as many anarchist outrages in Russia, Spain, and Italy in the period 1890- 9*0. The failure of governments to disappear in the face of this ter- nst agitation, especially in Russia, where the oppression of autocracy mereased after 1881, led, little by little, to a fading of the Intelligentsia's itn in destructive violence as a constructive action, as well as in the sat- Ving peasant commune, and in the survival of natural innocence in the \"\"thinking masses. Just at this point, about 1890, a great change began in Russia. Western ustrialism began to grow under governmental and foreign auspices; an an proletariat began to appear, and Marxist social theory came in from lC nnany. The growth of industrialism settled the violent academic dis- r e between YVesterners and Slavophiles as to whether Russia must fol- tne path of Western development or could escape it by falling back some native Slavic solutions hidden in the peasant commune; the e Wth of a proletariat gave the revolutionaries once again a social group ^nich to build; and Marxist theory gave the Intelligentsia an ideology • ic tne .V could fanatically embrace. These new developments, by lift- 5 ruissia from the impasse it had reached in 1885, were generally wel- • Berdyaev, Origin of Riissim Connmmimi (London, Geoffrey Bles, 1948), p. 45."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"92   TRAGEDY AND HOPE corned. Even the autocracy lifted the censorship to allow Marxist theory to circulate, in the belief that it would alleviate terrorist pressure since it eschewed direct political action, especially assassination, and postponed revolution until after industrialization had proceeded far enough to create a fully developed bourgeois class and a fully developed proletariat. To be sure, the theory created bv Marx's mid-nineteenth century Germanic background was (as we shall see) gradually changed by the age-long Russian outlook, at first bv the Leninist Bolshevik triumph over the Mensheviks and later by Stalin's Russian nationalist victory over Lenin's more Western rationalism, but in the period 1890-1914 the stalemate of opposed violence was broken, and progress, punctuated by violence and intolerance, appeared. This period of progress punctuated by violence which lasted from 1890 to 1914 has a number of aspects. Of these, the economic and social de- velopment will be discussed first, followed by the political and, lastly, the ideological. As late as the liberation of the serfs in 1863, Russia was practically un- touched by the industrial process, and was indeed more backward by far than Britain and France had been before the invention of the steam en- gine itself. Owing to lack of roads, transportation was very poor except for the excellent system of rivers, and these were frozen for months each year. Mud tracks, impassable for part of the year and only barely pass- able for the rest of the time, left villages relatively isolated, with the result that almost all handicraft products and much agricultural produce were locally produced and locally consumed. The serfs were impoverished after liberation, and held at a low standard of living by having a large part of their produce taken from them as rents to landlords and as taxes to the state bureaucracy. This served to drain a considerable fraction of the coun- try's agricultural and mineral production to the cities and to the export market. This fraction provided capital for the growth of a modern econ- omy after 1863, being exported to pay for the import of the necessary machinery and industrial raw materials. This was supplemented by the direct importation of capital from abroad, especially from Belgium and France, while much capital, especially for railroads, was provided by the government. Foreign capital amounted to about one-third of all indus- trial capital in 1890 and rose to almost one-half by 1900. The proportions varied from one activitiy to another, the foreign portion being, in 1900, at 70 percent in the field of mining, 42 percent in the field of metal- lurgical industry, but less than 10 percent in textiles. At the same date the entire capital of the railroads amounted to 4,700 million rubles, of which 3,500 belonged to the government. These two sources were of very great importance because, except in textiles, most industrial development was based on the railroads, and the earliest enterprises in heavy industry, apart from the old charcoal metallurgy of the Ural Mountains, were"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE TO I 9 I 7  93  oreign. The first great railroad concession, that of the Main Company or 2,650 miles of line, was given to a French company in 1857. A British rporation opened the exploitation of the great southern iron ore basin Krivoi Rog, while the German Nobel brothers began the development the petroleum industry at Baku (both about 1880). As a consequence of these factors the Russian economy remained ar g e 'y, but decreasingly, a colonial economy for most of the period 03-1914. There was a very low standard of living for the Russian peo- F e , With excessive exportation of consumers' commodities, even those adly needed by the Russian people themselves, these being used to ob- in foreign exchange to buy industrial or luxury commodities of foreign 0ri gin to be owned by the very small ruling class. This pattern of Rus- Slan economic organization has continued under the Soviet regime since '917- Ihe first Russian railroad opened in 1838, but growth was slow until 116 establishment of a rational plan of development in 1857. This plan s °ught to penetrate the chief agricultural regions, especially the black- earth region of the south, in order to connect them with the chief cities t \" e north and the export ports. At that time there were only 663 miles ° railroads, but this figure went up over tenfold by 1871, doubled again V 1881 (with 14,000 miles), reached 37,000 by 1901, and 46,600 by 1915. his building took place in two great waves, the first in the decade 1866- l8 75 and the second in the fifteen years 1891-1905. In these two periods averages of over 1,400 miles of track were constructed annually, while i n the intervening fifteen years, from 1876 to 1890, the average construc- 1011 was only 631 miles per year. The decrease in this middle period re- lated from the \"great depression\" in western Europe in 1873-1893, and culminated, in Russia, in the terrible famine of 1891. After this last date, railroad construction was pushed vigorously by Count Sergei Witte, who advanced from stationmaster to Minister of Finance, holding the latter P°st from 1892 to 1903. His greatest achievement was the single-tracked rans-Siberian line, which ran 6,365 miles from the Polish frontier to Jadivostok and was built in the fourteen years 1891-1905. This line, by permitting Russia to increase her political pressure in the Far East, brought m ain into an alliance with Japan (1902) and brought Russia into war *\"h Japan (1904-1905). *he railroads had a most profound effect on Russia from every point y iew, binding one-sixth of the earth's surface into a single political unit * n u transforming that country's economic, political, and social life. New are as, chiefly in the steppes, which had previously been too far from arkets to be used for any purpose but pastoral activities, were brought Oder cultivation (chiefly for grains and cotton), thus competing with £ central black-soil area. The drain of wealth from the peasants to the an and export markets was increased, especially in the period before"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"94  TRAGEDY AND HOPE 1890. This process was assisted by the advent of a money economy to those rural areas which had previously been closer to a self-sufficient or a barter basis. This increased agricultural specialization and weakened handicraft activities. The collection of rural products, which had pre- viously been in the hands of a few large commercial operators who worked slowly on a long-term basis, largely through Russia's more than six thousand annual fairs, were, after 1870, thanks to the railroad re- placed by a horde of small, quick-turnover middlemen who swarmed like ants through the countryside, offering the contents of their small pouches of money for grain, hemp, hides, fats, bristles, and feathers. This drain of goods from the rural areas was encouraged by the government through quotas and restrictions, price differentials and different railroad rates and taxes for the same commodities w ith different destinations. As a result, Russian sugar sold in London for about 40 percent of its price in Russia itself. Russia, with a domestic consumption of 10.5 pounds of sugar per capita compared to England's 9: pounds per capita, nevertheless ex- ported in 1900 a quarter of its total production of 1,802 million pounds. In the same year Russia exported almost 12 million pounds of cotton goods (chiefly to Persia and China), althought domestic consumption of cotton in Russia was only 5.3 pounds per capita compared to Eng- land's 39 pounds. In petroleum products, w here Russia had 48 percent of the total world production in 1900, about 13.3 percent was exported, although Russian consumption was only 12 pounds per capita each year compared to Germany's 42 pounds. In one of these products, kerosene (where Russia had the strongest potential domestic demand), almost 60 percent of the domestic production was exported. The full extent of this drain of w calth from the rural areas can be judged from the export figures in general. In 1891-1895 rural products formed 75 percent (and cereals 40 percent) of the total value of all Russian exports. Moreover, it was the better grains which were exported, a quarter of the wheat crop compared to one-fifteenth of the rve crop in 1900. That there was a certain improvement in this respect, as time passed, can be seen from the fact that the portion of the wheat crop exported fell from half in the 1880'sto one-sixth in 1912-1913. This policy of siphoning wealth into the export market gave Russia a favorable balance of trade (that is, excess of exports over imports) for the whole period after 1875, providing gold and foreign exchange which allowed the country to build up its gold reserve and to provide capital for its industrial development. In addition, billions of rubles were obtained by sales of bonds of the Russian government, largely in France as part of the French effort to build up the Triple Entente. The State Bank, which had increased its gold reserve from 475 million to 1,095 million rubles in the period 1890-1897, was made a bank of issue in 1897 and was required by law to redeem its notes in gold, thus placing Russia on the"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE TO I 9 I 7  95  international gold standard. The number of corporations in Russia in- creased from 504 with 912 million rubles capital (of which 215 million was foreign) in 1889 to 1,181 corporations with 1,737 million rubles capital (of which over 800 million was foreign) in 1899. The proportion of industrial concerns among these corporations steadily increased, being percent of the new capital flotations in 1874-1881 as compared to on l.V 11 percent in 1861-1873. Much of the impetus to industrial advance came from the railroads, since these, in the last decade of the nineteenth century, were by far me chief purchasers of ferrous metals, coal, and petroleum products. As a result, there was a spectacular outburst of economic productivity in this decade, followed by a decade of lower prosperity after 1900. The production of pig iron in the period 1860-1870 ranged about 350 thou- sand tons a year, rose to 997 thousand tons in 1890, to almost 1.6 million tons in 1895, ar> d reached a peak of 3.3 million tons in 1900. During this Period, iron production shifted from the charcoal foundries of the Urals to the modern coke furnaces of the Ukraine, the percentages of the total Russian production being 67 percent from the Urals to 6 per- ce nt from the south in 1870 and 20 percent from the Urals with 67 Percent from the south in 1913. The production figure for 1900 was not exceeded during the next decade, but rose after 1909 to reach 4.6 million °ns in 1913. This compared with 14.4 million tons in Germany, 31.5 million in the United States, or almost 9 million in the United Kingdom. Goal production presents a somewhat similar picture, except that its growth continued through the decade 1900-1910. Production rose from 75o thousand tons in 1870 to over 3.6 million tons in 1880 and reached most 7 million in 1890 and almost 17.5 million in 1900. From this point, coal production, unlike pig iron, continued upward to 26.2 million ns in IQO8 anc j to ^6 million in 1913. This last figure compares to ermany's production of 190 million tons, American production of 5*7 million tons, and British production of 287 million tons in that me year of 1913. In coal, as in pig iron, there was a geographic shift the center of production, one-third of the Russian coal coming from e Oonetz area in i860 while more than two-thirds came from that ar ea in i 000 and 70 percent in 1913. n petroleum there Avas a somewhat similar geographic shift in the Cent-** c    cor    er or production, Baku having better than 90 percent of the total in eve ry year from 187 o until after 1900 when the new Grozny fields and steady decline in Baku's output reduced the latter's percentage to 85 '910 and to 83 in 1913.

For"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"96  TRAGEDY AM) HOPE the next twelve vears output hovered somewhat below 8.4 million tons. Because the industrialization of Russia came so late, it was (except in textiles) on a large-scale basis from the beginning and was organized on a basis of financial capitalism after 1870 and of monopoly capitalism after 1902. Although factories employing over 500 workers amounted to only 3 percent of all factories in the iSoo's, 4 percent in 1903, and 5 percent in 1910, these factories generally employed over half of all factory workers. This was a far higher percentage than in Germany or the United States, and made it easier for labor agitators to organize the workers in these Russian factories. .Moreover, although Russia as a whole was not highly industrialized and output per worker or per unit for Russia as a whole was low (because of the continued existence of older forms of production), the new Russian factories were built with the most advanced technological equipment, sometimes to a degree which the untrained labor supply could not utilize. In 1912 the output of pig iron per furnace in the Ukraine was higher than in western Europe by a large margin, although smaller than in the United States by an equally large margin. Although the quantity of mechanical power available on 3 per capita basis for the average Russian was low in 1908 compared to western Europe or America (being only 1.6 horsepower per 100 persons in Russia compared to 25 in the United States, 24 in England, and 13 in Germany), the horsepower per industrial worker was higher in Russia than in any other continental country (being 92 horsepower per 100 workers in Russia compared to 85 in France, 73 '\" Germany, 153 in England, and 282 in the United States). All this made the Russian economy an economy of contradictions. Though the range of technical methods was very w ide, advanced techniques were lacking completely in some fields, and even whole fields of necessary industrial activities (such as machine tools or automobiles) were lacking. 1 he economy was poorly integrated, was extremely dependent on foreign trade (both for markets and for essential products), and was very dependent on government assistance, especially on government spend- ing. While the great mass of the Russian people continued, as late as 19'4' to live much as they had lived for generations, a small number lived m a new, and very insecure, world of industrialism, where they were at the mercy of foreign or governmental forces over which they had little control. The managers of this new world sought to improve their posi- tions, not by any effort to create a mass market in the other, mor e primitive, Russian economic world by improved methods of distribu- tion, by reduction of prices, or bv rising standards of living, but rather sought to increase their own profit margins on a narrow market by ruthless reduction of costs, especially wages, and by monopolistic com- binations to raise prices. These efforts led to labor agitation on one"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE TO I 9 I 7  97  and and to monopolistic capitalism on the other. Economic progress, ex- cept in some lines, was slowed up for these reasons during the whole ecade 1900-1909. Only in 1909, when a largely monopolistic structure °t industry had been created, was the increase in output of goods re- sumed and the struggle with labor somewhat abated. The earliest Russian cartels were formed with the encouragement of the Russian government and in those activities where foreign interests were most prevalent. In 1887 a sugar cartel was formed in order to permit foreign umping of this commodity. A similar agency was set up for kerosene •892, but the great period of formation of such organizations (usually the form of joint-selling agencies) began after the crisis of 1901. In 902 a cartel created by a dozen iron and steel firms handled almost tec-fourths of all Russian sales of these products. It was controlled by ou r foreign banking groups. A similar cartel, ruled from Berlin, took 0ver tne sales of almost all Russian production of iron pipe. Six Ukraine °n-orc firms in 1908 set up a cartel controlling 80 percent of Russia's production. In 1907 a cartel was created to control about three- 1 arters of Russia's agricultural implements. Others handled 97 percent railway cars, 94 percent of locomotives, and 94 percent of copper es. Eighteen Donetz coal firms in 1906 set up a cartel which sold lr ee-quarters of the coal output of that area. ne creation of monopoly was aided by a change in tariff policy. rc e trade, which had been established in the tariff of 1857, was cur- ' ed in 1877 and abandoned in 1891. The protective tariff of this latter . ar resulted in a severe tariff war with Germany as the Germans sought exclude Russian agricultural products in retaliation for the Russian ' nrr on manufactured goods. This \"war\" was settled in 1894 by a es of compromises, but the reopening of the German market to sian grain led to political agitation for protection on the part of an landlords. They were successful, as we shall see, in 1900 as a t of a deal with the German industrialists to support Tirpitz's na £l building program. n tne eve of the First World War, the Russian economy was in r y dubious state of health. As we have said, it was a patchwork attain *r and ' ^ mucn lacking in integration, very dependent on foreign government support, racked by labor disturbances, and, what was more threatening, by labor disturbances based on political rather W- ? n CCcm °mic motives, and shot through with all kinds of tcchno- o - weaknesses and discords.

Moreover, to make matters worse, Russia as a consequence of these things was losing ground in the race of production with France, Cer- manv, and the United States. These economic developments had profound political effects under the weak-willed Czar Nicholas II (1894-1917). For about a decade Nicholas tried to combine ruthless civil repression, economic advance, and an imperialist foreign policv in the Balkans and the Far Fast, with pious worldwide publicity for peace and universal disarmament, domestic distractions like anti-Semitic massacres (pogroms), forged ter- roristic documents, and faked terroristic attempts on the lives of high officials, including himself. This unlikelv melange collapsed completely in 1905-1908. When Count Wittc attempted to begin some kind of constitutional development by getting in touch with the functioning units of local o-overnment (the zemstvos. which had been effective in the famine of 1891), he was ousted from his position by an intrigue led by the murderous .Minister of Interior Vvacheslav Plehvc (1903). I he civil head of the Orthodox Church, Konstantin Pobedonostscv (1827- 1907) persecuted all dissenting religions, while allowing the Orthodox Church to become enveloped in ignorance and corruption. Most Roman Catholic monasteries in Poland were confiscated, while priests of that religion were forbidden to leave their villages. In Finland construction of Lutheran churches was forbidden, and schools of this religion were taken over bv the Moscow government. The Jews were persecuted, re- stricted to certain provinces (the Pale), excluded from most economic activities, subjected to heavy taxes (even on their religious activities), and allowed to form only ten percent of the pupils in schools (even in villages which were almost completely Jewish and where the schools were supported entirely by Jewish taxes). Hundreds of Jews were mas- sacred and thousands of their buildings wrecked in systematic three-day pogroms tolerated and sometimes encouraged bv the police. Marriages (and children) of Roman Catholic Uniates were made illegitimate. The Moslems in Asia and elsewhere were also persecuted. Even' effort was made to Russify non-Russian national groups, es- pecially on the western frontiers. The Finns, Baltic Germans, and Poles were not allowed to use their own languages in public life, and had to use Russian even in private schools and even on the primary level. Ad- ministrative autonomy in these areas, even that solemnly promised to Finland iong before, was destroyed, and they were dominated by Rus- sian police, Russian education, and the Russian Army. The peoples of these areas were subjected to military conscription more rigorously than the Russians themselves, and were Russified while in the ranks. Against the Russians themselves, unbelievable extremes of espionage, counterespionage, censorship, provocation, imprisonment without trial,"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE TO I 9 I 7  99  and outright brutality were employed. The revolutionaries responded with similar measures crowned by assassination. No one could trust anyone else, because revolutionaries were in the police, and members °f the police were in the highest ranks of the revolutionaries. Georgi Gapon, a priest secretly in the pay of the government, was encouraged to form labor unions and lead workers' agitations in order to increase c he employers' dependence on the autocracy, but when, in 1905, Gapon 'ed a mass march of workers to the Winter Palace to present a petition to the czar, thev were attacked bv the troops and hundreds were shot. Gapon was murdered the following year bv the revolutionaries as a traitor. In order to discredit the revolutionaries, the central Police De- partment in St. Petersburg \"printed at the government expense violent ap- peals to riot\" which were circulated all over the country by an or ganization of reactionaries. In one year (1906) the government exiled 35>ooo persons without trial and executed over 600 persons under a new decree which fixed the death penalty for ordinary crimes like robbery or insults to officials. In the three years 1906-1908, 5,140 offi- Cia ' s were killed or wounded, and 2,328 arrested persons were executed. * n 1909 it was revealed that a police agent, Azeff, had been a member °r the Central Committee of the Socialist Revolutionaries for vears and la d participated in plots to murder high officials, including Plehve and ne Grand Duke Sergius, without warning these. The former chief of Police who revealed this fact was sent to prison for doing so. Under conditions such as these no sensible government was possible, ncl all appeals for moderation were crushed between the extremists rorn both sides. The defeats of Russian forces in the war with Japan in '904-1905 brought events to a head. All dissatisfied groups began to g'tate, culminating in a successful general strike in October 1905. The mperor began to offer political reforms, although what was extended \" e °- a V was frequently taken back shortly after. A consultative assembly, e Duma, was established, elected on a broad suffrage but by very com- P 'cated procedures designed to reduce the democratic element.

The full power of the government was used to get a second Duma more to its taste, outlawing most of the Cadets, previ- ously the largest party, and preventing certain classes and groups from campaigning or voting. The result was a new Duma of much less ability, much less discipline, and with many unknown faces. The Cadets were reduced from 150 to 123, the Octobrists from about 42 to 32, while there were 46 extreme Right, 54 .Marxist Social Democrats, 35 Social Revolutionaries, at least 100 assorted Laboritcs, and scattered others. This group devoted much of its time to debating whether terrorist violence should be condemned. When Stolvpin demanded that the Social Democrats (.Marxists) should be kicked out, the Duma referred the matter to a committee; the assembly was immediately dissolved, and new elections were fixed for a third Duma (June, 1908). Under power- ful government intimidation, which included sending 31 Social Demo- crats to Siberia, the third Duma was elected. It was mostly an upper- class and upper-middle-class body, with the largest groups being 154 Oc- tobrists and 54 Cadets. This body was sufficiently docile to remain for five years (1907-1912). During this period both the Duma and the government followed a policy of drift, except for Stolvpin. Until 1910 this energetic administrator continued his efforts to combine oppression and reform, especially agrarian reform. Rural credit banks were es- tablished; various measures were taken to place larger amounts of land in the hands of peasants; restrictions on the migration of peasants, es- pecially to Siberia, were removed; participation in local government was opened to lower social classes previously excluded; education, es- pecially technical education, was made more accessible; and certain provisions for social insurance were enacted into law. After the Bosnian crisis of 1908 (to be discussed later), foreign affairs became increasingly absorbing, and by 1910 Stolvpin had lost his enthusiasm for reform, re- placing it by senseless efforts at Russification of the numerous minority groups. He was assassinated in the presence of the czar in 1911. The fourth Duma (1912-1916) was similar to the third, elected by complicated procedures and on a restricted suffrage. The policy of drift continued, and was more obvious since no energetic figure like Stolypin was to be found. On the contrary, the autocracy sank deeper into a morass of superstition and corruption. The influence of the czarina became more pervasive, and through her was extended the power of a number of religious mystics and charlatans, especially Rasputin. The imperial couple had ardently desired a son from their marriage in 1894. After the births of four daughters, their wish was fulfilled in 1904.

After 1907 she fell under the uence °f a Strange wanderer, Rasputin, a man whose personal habits aiu > appearance were both vicious and filthv but who had the power, • Sl c believed, to stop the czarevich's bleeding. The czarina fell com- P etely under Rasputin's control and, since the czar was completely under her control, Rasputin became the ruler of Russia, intermittently _ hrst, but then completely. This situation lasted until he was murdered December 1916. Rasputin used his power to satisfy his personal vices, 0 accumulate wealth by corruption, and to interfere in everv branch 01 the government, always in a destructive and unprogrcssive sense. As k u Bernard Pares put it, speaking of the czarina, \"Her letters to Nicholas 1 a ) by day contain the instructions which Rasputin gave on every tctail of administration of the Empire—the Church, the Ministers, fi- ance, railways, food supply, appointments, military operations, and a >ove all the Duma, and a simple comparison of the dates with the events which followed shows that in almost every case they were carried ° u t- In all her recommendations for ministerial posts, most of which are °pted, °ne of the primary considerations is always the attitude of th e given candidate to Rasputin.\" As the autocracy became increasingly corrupt and irresponsible in lls way, the slow growth toward a constitutional system which might av e developed from the zemstvo system of local government and ^ able membership of the first Duma was destroyed. The resumption economic expansion after 1909 could not counterbalance the per- \"Cious influence of the political paralysis. This situation was made even n °re hopeless by the growing importance of foreign affairs after 1908 and the failure of intellectual life to grow in any constructive fashion, he first of these complications will be discussed later; the second de- ser ves a few words here. 1 he general trend of intellectual development in Russia in the years er °re 1914 could hardly be regarded as hopeful. To be sure, there ^ ei \"e considerable advances in some fields such as literacy, natural sci- nc e, mathematics, and economic thought, but these contributed little to ny growth of moderation or to Russia's greatest intellectual need, a more mte grated outlook on life. The influence of the old Orthodox religious titude continued even in those who most emphatically rejected it. n e basic attitude of the Western tradition had grown toward diversity nd toleration, based on the belief that every aspect of life and of ll nian experience and every individual has some place in the complex 'ucture of reality if that place can only be found and that, accordingly, nit V of the whole of life can be reached by way of diversity rather than y any compulsory uniformity. This idea was entirely foreign to the"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"102  TRAGEDY AND HOPE Russian mind. Any Russian thinker, and hordes of other Russians with no capacity for thought, were driven by an insatiable thirst to find the \"key\" to life and to truth. Once this \"key\" has been found, all other aspects of human experience must be rejected as evil, and all men must be compelled to accept that key as the whole of life in a dreadful unity of uniformity. To make matters worse, many Russian thinkers sought to analyze the complexities of human experience by polarizing these into antitheses of mutually exclusive dualisms: Westerners versus Slavo- philes, individualism versus community, freedom versus fate, revolu- tionary versus reactionary, nature versus conventions, autocracy versus anarchy, and such. There was no logical correlation between these, so that individual thinkers frequently embraced either side of any antithe- sis, forming an incredible mixture of emotionally held faiths. More- over, individual thinkers frequently shifted from one side to another, or even oscillated back and forth between the extremes of these dualisms. In the most typical Russian minds both extremes were held simultane- ously, regardless of logical compatibility, in some kind of higher mystic unity beyond rational analysis. Thus, Russian thought provides us with striking examples of God-intoxicated atheists, revolutionary reactionaries, violent nonresisters, belligerent pacifists, compulsory liberators, and in- dividualistic totalitarians. The basic characteristic of Russian thought is its extremism. This took two forms: (i) any portion of human experience to which allegiance was given became the whole truth, demanding total allegiance, all else being evil deception; and (2) every living person was expected to accept this same portion or be damned as a minion of antichrist. Those who embraced the state were expected to embrace it as an autocracy in which the individual had no rights, else their allegiance was not pure; those who denied the state were expected to reject it utterly by adopt- ing anarchism. Those who became materialists had to become complete nihilists without place for any convention, ceremony, or sentiment. Those who questioned some minor aspect of the religious system were expected to become militant atheists, and if they did not take this step themselves, were driven to it by the clergy. Those who were con- sidered to be spiritual or said thev were spiritual were forgiven every kind of corruption and lechery (like Rasputin) because such material aspects were irrelevant. Those who sympathized with the oppressed were expected to burv themselves in the masses, living like them, eating like them, dressing like them, and renouncing all culture and thought (if they believed the masses lacked these things). The extremism of Russian thinkers can be seen in their attitudes to- ward such basic aspects of human experience as property, reason, the state, art, sex, or power. Always there was a fanatical tendency to eliminate as sinful and evil anything except the one aspect which the"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE TO I 9 I 7  IO3  thinker considered to he the key to the cosmos. Alexei Khomvakov (1804-1860), a Slavophile, wanted to reject reason completely, regarding it as \"the mortal sin of the West,\" while Fcdor Dostoevski (1821 —18S1) W'ent; so far in this direction that he wished to destroy all logic and all arithmetic, seeking, he said, '\"to free humanity from the tyranny of two plus two equals four.\" Many Russian thinkers, long before the Soviets, regarded all property as sinful. Others felt the same way about sex. Leo 1 olstoi, the great novelist and essavist (T828-1910), considered all property and all sex to be evil. Western thought, which has usually tried to hnd a place in the cosmos for everything and has felt that anything !s acceptable in its proper place, recoils from such fanaticism. The West, tor example, has rarely felt it necessary to justify the existence of art, hut many thinkers in Russia (like Plato long ago) have rejected all art as CV1 '- Tolstoi, among others, had moments (as in the essay What Is Al ' 1 '- of 1897 or On Shakespeare and the Drama of 1903) when he de- nounced most art and literature, including his own novels, as vain, ir- relevant, and satanic. Similarly the West, while it has sometimes looked askance at sex and more frequently has overemphasized it, has generally c| t that sex had a proper function in its proper place. In Russia, how- cv 'er, many thinkers, including once again Tolstoi (The Kreutzer Sonata of '889), have insisted that sex was evil in all places and under all e'tcunistances, and most sinful in marriage. The disruptive effects of such 1 eas upon social or family life can be seen in the later years of Tol- ' 01 s personal life, culminating in his last final hatred of his long-suffer- ^S wife whom he came to regard as the instrument of his fall from fa'ace. B ut w hiie Tolstoi praised marriage without sex, other Russians, ith even greater vehemence, praised sex without marriage, regarding ls social institution as an unnecessary impediment in the path of pure \"uman impulse. n some ways we find in Tolstoi the culmination of Russian thought. rejected all power, all violence, most art, all sex, all public authority, and all    .    an property as evil. To him the key of the universe was to be und^ in Christ's injunction, \"Resist not evil.\" All other aspects of . rist s teachings except those which flow directly from this were re- eu, including any belief in Christ's divinity or in a personal God. .

And this point"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"104   TRAGEDY AND HOPE of view could be held with such fanaticism only by persons to whom life, family, or any objective gain is worthless. This is a dominant idea in all the Russian Intelligentsia, an idea going back through Plato to ancient Asia: All objective reality is of no importance except as symbols for some subjective truth. This was, of course, the point of view of the Neoplatonic thinkers of the early Christian period. It was generally the point of view of the early Christian heretics and of those Western heretics like the Cathari (Albigenses) who were derived from this East- ern philosophic position. In modern Russian thought it is well repre- sented by Dostoevski, who while chronologicallv earlier than Tolstoi is spiritually later. To Dostoevski every object and every act is merely a symbol for some elusive spiritual truth. From this point of view comes an outlook which makes his characters almost incomprehensible to the average person in the Western tradition: if such a character obtains a fortune, he cries, \"I am ruined!\" If he is acquitted on a murder charge, or seems likely to be, he exclaims, \"I am condemned,\" and seeks to incriminate himself in order to ensure the punishment which is so necessary for his own spiritual self-acquittal. If he deliberately misses his opponent in a duel, he has a guiltv conscience, and says, \"I should not have injured him thus; I should have killed him!\" In each case the speaker cares nothing about property, punishment, or life. He cares only about spiritual values: asceticism, guilt, remorse, injury to one's self- respect. In the same way, the early religious thinkers, both Christian and non-Christian, regarded all objects as symbols for spiritual values, all temporal success as an inhibition on spiritual life, and felt that wealth could be obtained only by getting rid of property, life could be found only by dying (a direct quotation from Plato), eternity could be found only if time ended, and the soul could be freed only if the body were enslaved. Thus, as late as 1910 when Tolstoi died, Russia remained true to its Greek-Byzantine intellectual tradition. We have noted that Dostoevski, who lived slightly before Tolstoi, nevertheless had ideas which were chronologically in advance of Tol- stoi's ideas. In fact, in many ways, Dostoevski was a precursor of the Bolsheviks. Concentrating his attention on poverty, crime, and human misery, always seeking the real meaning behind every overt act or word, he eventually reached a position where the distinction between appear- ance and significance became so wide that these two were in contradic- tion with each other. This contradiction was really the struggle between God and the Devil in the soul of man. Since this struggle is without end, there is no solution to men's problems except to face suffering resolutely. Such suffering purges men of all artificiality and joins them together in one mass. In this mass the Russian people, because of their greater suffering and their greater spirituality, are the hope of the world and must save the world from the materialism, violence, and"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE TO I 9 I 7  105  selfishness of Western civilization.

This impression was mistaken, and by the late 1950's Europe was in a position, once again, to play an independent role in world affairs. In previous chapters we have examined the background of Western Civilization and of the Russian Empire to the second decade of the twentieth centurv. In the present chapter we shall examine the situation in the buffer fringe until about the end of that same decade. At the beginning of the twentieth centurv the areas which were to become the buffer fringe consisted of (1) the Near East dominated by the Ottoman Empire, (2) the Middle East dominated by the British Em- pire in India, and (3) the Far East, consisting of two old civilizations, China and Japan. On the outskirts of these were the lesser colonial areas of Africa, Malaysia, and Indonesia. At this point we shall consider the three major areas of the buffer fringe with a brief glance at Africa. The Near East to 1914 For the space of over a centurv, from shortly after the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 until 1922, the relationships of the Great Powers were exacerbated by what was known as the \"Near East Ques- tion.\" This problem, which arose from the growing weakness of the Ottoman Empire, was concerned with the question of what would become of the lands and peoples left without government by the retreat of Turkish power. The problem was made more complex by the fact that Turkish power did not withdraw but rather decayed right were it was, so that in many areas it continued to exist in laW when it had already ceased to function in fact because of the weakness and corruption of the sultan's government.

At its height the Ottoman Empire was larger than any contemporary European state in both area and population. South of the Mediterranean 1C fetched from the Atlantic Ocean in .Morocco to the Persian Gulf; north of the Mediterranean it stretched from the Adriatic Sea to the s pi an Sea, including the Balkans as far north as Poland and the whole n °rthern shore of the Black Sea. This vast empire was divided into wenty-one governments and subdivided into seventy vilayets, each under a pasha. The whole structure was held together as a tribute- gathering military system by the fact that the rulers in all parts were • uslinis. The supreme ruler in Constantinople was not only sultan (and Us head of the empire) but was also caliph (and thus defender of the uslim creed). In most of the empire the mass of the people were A4us- nis like their rulers, but in much of the empire the masses of the P eo ples were non-Muslims, being Roman Christians, Orthodox Christians, Jc Ws, or other creeds. 'nguistic variations were even more notable than religious distinc- s - Only the peoples of Anatolia generally spoke Turkish, while to . °^ N°rth Africa and the Near East spoke various Semitic and mitic dialects of which the most prevalent was Arabic. From Syria , . e Caspian Sea across the base of Anatolia were several languages, of TO the chief were Kurdish and Armenian. The shores of the Aegean •S especially the western, were generally Greek-speaking. The north- shore was a confused mixture of Turkish, Greek, and Bulgarian king peoples. The eastern shore of the Adriatic was Greek-speaking ti rl ° '* ot ' 1 P ara \" c '< f hen Albanian for almost three degrees of lati- ' merging gradually into various South Slav languages like Croat, e ne, and (in the interior) Serb.

Such diversity made any hopes of political unity by consent or by federation almost impossible in the Balkans. Indeed, it was almost impossible to draw any political lines which would coincide with geographic and linguistic or religious lines, because lin- guistic and religious distinctions frequently indicated class distinctions. Thus the upper and lower classes or the commercial and the agricultural groups even in the same district often had different languages or differ- ent religions. Such a pattern of diversity could be held together most easily by a simple display of military force. This was what the Turks provided. Militarism and fiscalism were the two keynotes of Turkish rule, and were quite sufficient to hold the empire together as long as both remained effective and the empire was free from outside interfer- ence. But in the course of the eighteenth century Turkish administra- tion became ineffective and outside interference became important. The sultan, who was a completely absolute ruler, became very quickly a completely arbitrary ruler. This characteristic extended to all his ac- tivities. He filled his harem with any women who pleased his fancy, without any formal ceremony. Such numerous and temporary liaisons produced numerous children, of whom many were neglected or even forgotten. Accordingly, the succession to the throne never became es- tablished and was never based on primogeniture. As a consequence, the sultan came to fear murder from almost any direction. To avoid this, he tended to surround himself with persons who could have no possible chance of succeeding him: women, children, Negroes, eunuchs, and Christians. All the sultans from 1451 onward were born of slave mothers and only one sultan after this date even bothered to contract a formal marriage. Such a way of life isolated the sultan from his sub- jects completely. This isolation applied to the process of government as well as to the ruler's personal life. Most of the sultans paid little heed to government, leaving this to their grand viziers and the local pashas. The former ha\" no tenure, being appointed or removed in accordance with the whims of harem intrigue. The pashas tended to become increasingly inde- pendent, since they collected local taxes and raised local military forces. The fact that the sultan was also caliph (and thus religious successor to Muhammad), and the religious belief that the government was under divine guidance and should be obeyed, however unjust and tyrannical, made all religious thinking on political or social questions take the form of justification of the status quo, and made any kind of reform almost"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"THE BUFFER FRINGE  11 3 impossible. Reform could come only from the Sultan, but his ignorance and isolation from society made reform unlikely. In consequence the whole system became increasingly weak and corrupt. The administra- tion was chaotic, inefficient, and arbitrary. Almost nothing could be done without gifts and bribes to officials, and it was not always possible 0 know what official or series of officials were the correct ones to reward. *he chaos and weakness which we have described were in full blos- som by the seventeenth century, and grew worse during the next two undred years. As early as 1699 the sultan lost Hungary, Transylvania, Croatia, and Slavonia to the Habsburgs, parts of the western Balkans 0 Venice, and districts in the north to Poland. In the course of the ei ghteenth centurv, Russia acquired areas north of the Black Sea, notably the Crimea. u uring the nineteenth century, the Near East question became increas- g'y acute. Russia emerged from the Napoleonic Wars as a Great Power, le to increase its pressure on Turkey. This pressure resulted from fee motivations. Russian imperialism sought to win an outlet to open 7 aters in the south by dominating the Black Sea and by winning access the Aegean through the acquisition of the Straits and Constantinople. at er this effort was supplemented by economic and diplomatic pressure n \"ersia in order to reach the Persian Gulf. At the same time, Russia re garded itself as the protector of the Orthodox Christians in the Otto- an Empire, and as early as 1774 had obtained the sultan's consent to this protective role. Moreover, as the most powerful Slav state, Russia had ltions t0 t> e regarded as the protector of the Slavs in the sultan's domains. inese Russian ambitions could never have been tfnvarted by the ' U tan alone, but he did not need to stand alone. He generally found support from Britain and increasingly from France. Britain was ob- - ssed with the need to defend India, which was a manpower pool and Uitary staging area vital to the defense of the whole empire. From 4° to 1007, it faced the nightmare possibility that Russia might at- ni pt to cross Afghanistan to northwest India, or cross Persia to the ersian Gulf, or penetrate through the Dardanelles and the Aegean nt0 the British \"lifeline to India\" by way of the Mediterranean. The pening 0 f the Suez Canal in 1869 increased the importance of this n e terr anean route to the east in British eyes. It was protected by Ntish forces in Gibraltar, Malta (acquired 1800), Cyprus (1878), and Jjypt (1882). In general, in spite of English humanitarian sympathy p the peoples subject to the tyranny of the Turk, and in spite of gland's regard for the merits of good government, British imperial ^ lcv considered that its interests would be safer with a weak, if cor- ru Pt> Turkey in the Near East than they would be with any Great"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"114  TRAGEDY AND HOPE Power in that area or with the area broken up into small independent states which might fall under the influence of the Great Powers. The French concern with the Near East was parallel to, hut weaker than, that of Britain. Thev had cultural and trade relations with the Levant going hack, in some cases, to the Crusades. In addition the French had ancient claims, revived in 1854, to be considered the pro- tectors of Roman Catholics in the Ottoman Empire and of the \"holy places\" in Jerusalem. Three other influences which became increasingly strong in the Near East were the growth of nationalism and the growing interests of Austria (after 1866) and of Germany (after 1889). The first stirrings of Balkan nationalism can be seen in the revolt of the Serbs in 1804-1812. By seizing Bessarabia from Turkey in 1812, Russia won the right for local self-government for the Serbs. Unfortunately, these latter began almost immediately to fight one another, the chief split being between a Russophile group led by Milan Obrenovich and a Serb nationalist group led by George Petrovic (better known as Karageorge). The Serb state, formally established in 1830, was bounded by the rivers Dvina, Save, Danube, and Timok. With local autonomy under Turkish suzerainty, it continued to pay tribute to the sultan and to support garrisons of Turkish troops. The vicious feud between Obrenovich and Karageorgevic continued after Serbia obtained complete independence in 1S78. The Obrenovich dynasty ruled in 1817—1842 and 1858-1903, while the Karageorgevic group ruled in 1842-1858 and 1903-1945- The intrigues of these two against each other broadened into a con- stitutional conflict in which the Obrenovich group supported the some- what less liberal constitution of 1869, while the Karageorgevic group supported the somewhat more liberal constitution of 1889. The former constitution was in effect in 1869-1889 and again in 1894-1903, while the latter was in effect in 1889-1894 and again in 1903-1921. In order to win popular support by an appeal to nationalist sentiments, both groups plotted against Turkey and later against Austria-Hungary. A second example of Balkan nationalism appeared in the Greek strug- gle for independence from the sultan (1821-1830). After Greeks and Muslims had massacred each other by the thousands, Greek independ- ence was established with a constitutional monarchy under the guar- antee of the three Great Powers. A Bavarian prince was placed on the throne and began to establish a centralized, bureaucratic, constitutional state which was quite unsuited for a country with such unconstitutional traditions, poor transportation and communications, a low level o* literacy, and a high level of partisan localism. After thirty turbulent years (1832-1862), Otto of Bavaria was deposed and replaced by a Danish prince and a completely democratic unicameral government which functioned only slightly better.

I he first beginnings of Balkan nationalism must not be overemphasized. While the inhabitants of the area have always been unfriendly to out- siders and resentful of burdensome governments, these sentiments deserve 0 be regarded as provincialism or localism rather than nationalism. Such ee ' ln gs are prevalent among all primitive peoples and must not be re- garded as nationalism unless thev are so wide as to embrace loyalty to a11 peoples of the same language and culture and are organized in such asnion that this loyalty is directed toward the state as the core of nation- 1st strivings. Understood in this way, nationalism became a very potent acf or in the disruption of the Ottoman Empire only after 1878. Closely related to the beginnings of Balkan nationalism were the be- b nnings of Pan-Slavism and the various \"pan-movements\" in reaction to ls > such as Pan-Islamism. These rose to a significant level only at the Ver y end of the nineteenth century. Simply defined, Pan-Slavism was a °vement for cultural unity, and, perhaps in the long run, political 1 Y among the Slavs. In practice it came to mean the right of Russia assume the role of protector of the Slav peoples outside Russia itself. irnes it was difficult for some peoples, especially Russia's enemies, to mguish between Pan-Slavism and Russian imperialism. Equally simply !le d, Pan-Islamism was a movement for unity or at least cooperation among a ll the Muslim peoples in order to resist the encroachments of the f opean Powers on Muslim territories. In concrete terms it sought to ^ the caliph a religious leadership, and perhaps in time a political ership such as he had really never previously possessed. Both of these r -movements are of no importance until the end of the nineteenth , Ur y, while Balkan nationalism was only slightly earlier than they in its nse to importance. nese Balkan nationalists had romantic dreams about uniting peoples »e same language, and generally looked back, with a distorted his- cal perspective, to some period when their co-linguists had played a re lni portant political role. The Greeks dreamed of a revived Byzantine e or even of a Periclean Athenian Empire. The Serbs dreamed of the f ? Stephen Dushan, while the Bulgars went further back to the days ne Bulgarian Empire of Svmeon in the early tenth century. However, must remember that even as late as the beginning of the twentieth u ry such dreams were found only among the educated minority of an peoples.

And at all times localism and class an- tagonisms (especially rural hostility against urban groups) remained at a high level. Russia made war on Turkey five times in the nineteenth century. On the last two occasions the Great Powers intervened to prevent Russia from imposing its will on the sultan. The first intervention led to the Crimean War (i854-1856) and the Congress of Paris (1856), while the second intervention, at the Congress of Berlin in 1878, rewrote a peace treaty which the czar had just imposed on the sultan (Treaty of San Stefano, 1877). In 1853 the czar, as protector of the Orthodox Christians of the Otto- man Empire, occupied the principalities of .Moldavia and Wallachia north of the Danube and east of the Carpathians. Under British pressure the sultan declared war on Russia, and was supported by Britain, France, and Sardinia in the ensuing \"Crimean War.\" Under threat of joining the anti-Russian forces, Austria forced the czar to evacuate the principalities, and occupied them herself, thus exposing an Austro-Russian rivalry in the Balkans which continued for two generations and ultimately precipitated the World War of 1914-1918. The Congress of Paris of 1856 sought to remove all possibility of any future Russian intervention in Turkish affairs. The integrity of Turkey was guaranteed, Russia gave up its claim as protector of the sultans Christian subjects, the Black Sea was \"neutralized\" by prohibiting all naval vessels and naval arsenals on its waters and shores, an International Commission was set up to assure free navigation of the Danube, and in 1862, after several years of indecision, the two principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia, along with Bessarabia, were allowed to form the state of Romania. The new state remained technically under Turkish suzerainty until 1878. It was the most progressive of the successor states of the Otto- man Empire, with advanced educational and judicial systems based on those of Napoleonic France, and a thoroughgoing agrarian reform. This last, which was executed in two stages (1863-1866 and 1918-192O' divided up the great estates of the Church and the nobility, and wiped away all vestiges of manorial dues or serfdom. Under a liberal, but not democratic, constitution, a German prince, Charles of Flohenzollern' Sigmaringen (1866-1914), established a new dynasty which was ended only in 1948. During this whole period the cultural and educational systems of the country continued to be orientated toward France in sharp contrast to the inclinations of the ruling dynasty, which had Germa* 1 svmpathies. The Romanian possession of Bessarabia and their genera' pride in their Latin heritage, as reflected in the name of the country, set up a barrier to good relations with Russia, although the majority °' Romanians were members of the Orthodox Church.

Broad verbal promises in this direction were made by the sultan in the period 1839— '°77> and there were even certain efforts to execute these promises. The army w as reorganized on a European basis with the assistance of Prussia, -ocal government was reorganized and centralized, and the fiscal sys- em greatly improved, chiefly by curtailing the use of tax farmers; gov- ernment officials were shifted from a fee-paid basis to a salaried basis; ne slave market was abolished, although this meant a large reduction in e sultan's income; the religious monopoly in education was curtailed and a considerable impetus given to secular technical education. Finally, n I 85 <5 » in an edict forced on the sultan by the Great Powers, an effort as made to establish a secular state in Turkey by abolishing all inequali- les based on creed in respect to personal freedom, law, property, taxation, ar »d eligibility for office or military service. n practice, none of these paper reforms was very effective. It was not possible to change the customs of the Turkish people by paper enact- ments. Indeed, any attempt to do so aroused the anger of many Muslims the point where their personal conduct toward non-Muslims became °rse. At the same time, these promises led the non-Muslims to expect rer treatment, so that relations between the various groups were ex- acerbated. Even if the sultan had had every intention of carrying out his ^ ated reforms, he would have had extraordinary difficulties in doing so ecause of the structure of Turkish society and the complete lack of rained administrators or even of literate people. The Turkish state was \"eocratic state, and Turkish society was a patriarchal or even a tribal society. Any movement toward secularization or toward social equality ould easily result, not in reform, but in complete destruction of the ociety by dissolving the religious and authoritarian relationships which eld both the state and society together. But the movement toward re- rm lacked the wholehearted support of the sultan; it aroused the oppo- 10n of the more conservative, and in some ways more loyal, groups of Usurns; it aroused the opposition of many liberal Turks because it was rived from Western pressure on Turkey; it aroused opposition from arr y Christian or non-Turkish groups who feared that a successful re- rrn might weaken their chances of breaking up the Ottoman Empire °mpletely; and the efforts at reform, being aimed at the theocratic laracter of the Turkish state, counteracted the sultan's efforts to make •mself the leader of Pan-Islamism and to use his title of caliph to mobilize on-Ottoman Muslims in India, Russia, and the East to support him in !s struggles with the European Great Powers. u n the other hand, it was equally clear that Turkey could not meet any Ur opean state on a basis of military equality until it was westernized. tn e same time, the cheap machinery-made industrial products of the"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"H8  TRAGEDY AND HOPE Western Powers began to pour into Turkey and to destroy the ability of the handicraft artisans of Turkey to make a living. This could not be prevented by tariff protection because the sultan was bound by inter- national agreements to keep his customs duties at a low level. At the same time, the appeal of Western ways of life began to be felt by some of the sultan's subjects who knew them. These began to agitate for in- dustrialism or for railroad construction, for wider opportunities in edu- cation, especially technical education, for reforms in the Turkish language, and for new, less formal, kinds of Turkish literature, for honest and impersonal methods of administration in justice and public finance, ana for all those things which, by making the Western Powers strong, made them a danger to Turkey. The sultan made feeble efforts to reform in the period 1838—1875, but by the latter date he was completely disillusioned with these efforts, and shifted over to a policy of ruthless censorship and repression; this repres- sion led, at last, to the so-called \"Young Turk\" rebellion of 1908. The shift from feeble reform to merciless repression coincided with a renewal of the Russian attacks on Turkey. These attacks were incited by Turkish butchery of Bulgarian agitators in Macedonia and a success- ful Turkish war on Serbia. Appealing to the doctrine of Pan-Slavism, Russia came to the rescue of the Bulgars and Serbs, and quickly defeated the Turks, forcing them to accept the Treaty of San Stefano before any of the Western Powers could intervene (1877). Among other provisions, this treaty set up a large state of Bulgaria, including much of Macedonia, independent of Turkey and under Russian military occupation. This Treaty of San Stefano, especially the provision for a large Bui\" garian state, which, it was feared, would be nothing more than a Russian tool, was completely unacceptable to England and Austria. Joining with France, Germany, and Italy, they forced Russia to come to a conference at Berlin where the treaty was completely rewritten (1878). The inde- pendence of Serbia, Montenegro, and Romania was accepted, as were the Russian acquisitions of Kars and Batum, east of the Black Sea.

Only errnany asked for nothing, and received the sultan's thanks and friend- ship for its moderation. he Treaty of Berlin of 1878 was a disaster from almost every point Vlc w because it left every state, except Austria, with its appetite netted and its hunger unsatisfied. The Pan-Slavs, the Romanians, the ul gars, the South Slavs, the Greeks, and the Turks were all disgruntled 1 the settlement. The agreement turned the Balkans into an open P Vvder keg from which the spark was kept away onlv with great diffi- ty and only for twenty years. It also opened up the prospect of the l Ul dation of the Turkish possessions in North Africa, thus inciting a rivalry ben veen the Great Powers which was a constant danger to the j, ace ' n the period 1878-1912. The Romanian loss of Bessarabia, the . £ ar ian loss of Eastern Rumelia, the South Slav loss of its hope of reach- 5 the Adriatic or even of reaching Montenegro (because of the Austrian Pupation of Bosnia and Novi-Bazar), the Greek failure to get Thessaly '-rete, and the complete discomfiture of the Turks created an atmos- j. ere 0 ' general dissatisfaction.

Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha was elected to succeed Alexander, but was unacceptable to Russia and was recognized by none of the Powers until his reconciliation with Russia in 1896. The state was generally in turmoil during this period, plots and assassinations steadily following one another. A Macedonian revolutionary organiza- tion known as I.MRO, working for independence for their area, adopted an increasingly terrorist policy, killing any Bulgarian or Romanian states- man who did not work wholeheartedly in cooperation with their efforts. Agitated Bulgarians formed insurgent bands which made raids into Mace- donia, and insurrection became endemic in the province, bursting out in full force in 1902. By that date Serb and Greek bands had joined in the confusion. The Powers intervened at that point to inaugurate a program of reform in Macedonia under Austro-Russian supervision. The Congress of Berlin began the liquidation of the Turkish position in North Africa. France, which had been occupying Algeria since 1830, established a French protectorate over Tunis as well in 1881. This led to the British occupation of Egvpt the following year. Not to be outdone, Italy put in a claim for Tripoli but could get no more than an exchange of notes, known as the Mediterranean Agreement of 1887, by which England, Italy, Austria, Spain, and Germany promised to maintain the status quo in the Mediterranean, the Adriatic, the Aegean, and the Black seas, unless all parties agreed to changes. The only concrete advantage to Italy in this was a British promise of support in North Africa in return for Italian support of the British position in Egypt. This provided only tenuous satisfaction for the Italian ambitions in Tripoli, but it was rein- forced in 1900 by a French-Italian agreement by which Italy gave France a free hand in Morocco in return for a free hand in Tripoli. By 1900 an entirely new factor began to intrude into the Eastern Question. Under Bismarck (1862-1890) Germany had avoided all non- European adventures. Under William II (1888-1918) any kind of ad- venture, especially a remote and uncertain one, was welcomed. In the earlier period Germany had concerned itself with the Near East Ques- tion only as a member of the European \"concert of Powers\" and with 3 few incidental issues such as the use of German officers to train the Turkish Army. After 1889 the situation was different. Economically, the Germans began to invade Anatolia by establishing trading agencies and banking facilities; politically, Germany sought to strengthen Turkey s international position in even' way. This effort was symbolized by the German Kaiser's two visits to the sultan in 1889 and 1898. On the latter occasion he solemnly promised his friendship to \"the Sultan Abdul Hami\" and the three hundred million Muhammadans who revere him as caliph- Most important, perhaps, was the projected \"Berlin to Baghdad\" railway scheme which completed its main trunk line from the Austro-Hungarian"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"THE BUFFER FRINGE  121   order to Nusaybin in northern Mesopotamia by September 1918. This project was of the greatest economic, strategic, and political importance not only to the Ottoman Empire and the Near East but to the whole of urope. Economically, it tapped a region of great mineral and agricul- Ur al resources, including the world's greatest petroleum reserves. Thes< were brought into contact with Constantinople and, beyond that, witl entral and northwestern Europe. Germany, which was industrializec a e , had a great, unsatisfied demand for food and raw materials and 1 great capacity to manufacture industrial products which could be ex- ported to pay for such food and raw materials. Efforts had been made and ontmued to be made by Germany to find a solution to this problem y opening trade relations with South America, the Far East, and North merica. Banking facilities and a merchant marine were being established 0 encourage such trade relations. But the Germans, with their strong ategic sense, knew well that relations with the areas mentioned were 1 the mercy of the British fleet, which would, almost unquestionably, ontrol the seas during wartime. The Berlin-to-Baghdad Railway solved es e crucial problems. It put the German metallurgical industry in uch with the great metal resources of Anatolia; it put the German tex- e industry in touch with the supplies of wool, cotton, and hemp of the kans, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia; in fact, it brought to almost every \"ranch of German industry the possibility of finding a solution for its 1I:i cal market and raw-material problems. Best of all, these connections, ln g almost entirely overland, would be within reach of the German - rmy and beyond the reach of the British Navy. ° r Turkey itself the railway was equally significant. Strategically it . acJ e it possible, for the first time, for Turkey to mobilize her full power t ne Balkans, the Caucasus area, the Persian Gulf, or the Levant. It 5 eatly increased the economic prosperity of the whole country; it could ru n (as it was after 1911) on Mesopotamian petroleum; it provided . ets and thus incentives for increased production of agricultural and ne ral products; it greatly reduced political discontent, public disorder, banditry in the areas through which it ran; it greatly increased the enues of the Ottoman treasury in spite of the government's engagement P a y subsidies to the railroad for each mile of track built and for a jJ5 an teed income per mile each year. he Great Powers showed mild approval of the Baghdad Railway until ut 1900. Then, for more than ten years, Russia, Britain, and France owed violent disapproval, and did all they could to obstruct the project. * er 1910 this disapproval was largely removed by a series of agreements . wind-, tlie Ottoman Empire was divided into exclusive spheres of • Uen ce. During the period of disapproval the Great Powers concerned ed such a barrage of propaganda against the plan that it is necessary, n to day, to warn against its influence. They described the Baghdad"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"122  TRAGEDY AKD HOPE Railway as the entering wedge of German imperialist aggression seeking to weaken and destrov the Ottoman Empire and the stakes of the other Powers in the area. The evidence shows quite the contrary. Germany was the only Great Power which wanted the Ottoman Empire to be strong and intact. Britain wanted it to be weak and intact. France gen- erally shared the British point of view, although the French, with a $500,000,000 investment in the area, wanted Turkey to be prosperous as well. Russia wanted it to be weak and partitioned, a view which was shared bv the Italians and, to some extent, by the Austrians. The Germans were not onlv favorablv inclined toward Turkey; their conduct seems to have been completely fair in regard to the administration of the Baghdad Railwav itself. At a time when American and other rail- ways were practicing wholesale discrimination between customers in regard to rates and freight handling, the Germans had the same rates and same treatment for all, including Germans and non-Germans. They worked to make the railroad efficient and profitable, although their income from it was guaranteed by the Turkish government. In con- sequence the Turkish payments to the railroad steadily declined, and the government was able to share in its profits to the extent of almost three million francs in 1914. Moreover, the Germans did not seek to monopo- lize control of the railroad, offering to share equally with France and England and eventually with other Powers. France accepted this offer in 1899, but Britain continued to refuse, and placed every obstacle in the path of the project. When the Ottoman government in 1911 sought to raise their customs duties from 11 to 14 percent in order to finance the continued construction of the railway, Britain prevented this. In order to carry on the project, the Germans sold their railroad interests in the Balkans and gave up the Ottoman building subsidy of $275,000 a kilo- meter. In striking contrast to this attitude, the Russians forced the Turks to change the original route of the line from northern Anatolia to south- ern Anatolia by threatening to take immediate measures to collect all the arrears, amounting to over 57 million francs, due to the czar from Turkey under the Treaty of 1878. The Russians regarded the projected railway as a strategic threat to their Armenian frontier. Ultimately, in 1900, they forced the sultan to promise to grant no concessions to build railways in northern Anatolia or Armenia except with Russian approval. The French government, in spite of the French investments in Turkey 01 2.5 billion francs, refused to allow Baghdad Railway securities to he handled on the Paris Stock Exchange. To block the growth of German Catholic missionary activities in the Ottoman Empire, the French per* suaded the Pope to issue an encyclical ordering all missionaries in that empire to communicate with the Vatican through the French consul tes. The British opposition became intense onlv in April, 1903. Early in tha 1 month Prime Minister Arthur Balfour and Foreign Secretary Lord Lans-"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"THE BUFFER FRINGE  123  downe made an agreement for joint German, French, and British control of the railroad. Within three weeks this agreement was repudiated by the government because of newspaper protests against it, although it would nave reduced the Turks and Germans together to only fourteen out of thirty votes on the board of directors of the railway. When the Turkish government in 1910 tried to borrow abroad $30 million, secured by the customs receipts of the country, it was summarily rebuffed in Paris and '-ondon, but obtained the sum without hesitation in Berlin. In view of these facts, the growth of German prestige and the decline in favor of the Western Powers at the sultan's court is not surprising, and goes far to explain the Turkish intervention on the side of the Central Powers in the war of 1914-1918. 1 he Baghdad Railway played no real role in the outbreak of the war ot ^'4 because the Germans in the period 1910-1914 were able to reduce the Great Powers' objections to the scheme. This was done irough a series of agreements which divided Turkey into spheres of oteign influence. In November, 1910, a German-Russian agreement \"otsdam gave Russia a free hand in northern Persia, withdrew all Rus- an opposition to the Baghdad Railway, and pledged both parties to tpport equal trade opportunities for all (the \"open-door\" policy) in eir respective areas of influence in the Near East. The French were B Veri 2,000 miles of railway concessions in western and northern Anatolia lr > Syria in 1910-1912 and signed a secret agreement with the Ger- us m February 1914, by which these regions were recognized as tench \"spheres of influence,\" while the route of the Baghdad Railway as recognized as a German sphere of influence; both Powers promised Work to increase the Ottoman tax receipts; the French withdrew their Pposition to the railway; and the French gave the Germans the 70- R ion-franc investm ent which the French already had in the Baghdad Uway in return for an equal amount in the Turkish bond issue of 01 'i which France had earlier rebuffed, plus a lucrative discount on new Ottoman bond issue of 1914. The British drove a much harder •tgain with the Germans. Bv an agreement of June 1914, Britain with- r e\\v her opposition to the Baghdad Railway, allowed Turkey to raise customs from 11 percent to 15 percent, and accepted a German sphere interest along the railway route in return for promises (r) that the Way would not be extended to the Persian Gulf but would stop at Sf a on the Tigris River, (2) that British capitalists would be given lonopoly on the navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers and ex- sive control over irrigation projects based on these rivers, ( 3) that two ish subjects would be given seats on the board of directors of the gtdad Railway, (4) that Britain would have exclusive control over Commercial activities of Kuwait, the only good port on the upper lan Gulf; (5) that a monopoly over the oil resources of the area from"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"124  TRAGEDY AND HOPE Mosul to Baghdad would be given to a new corporation in which British finances would have a half-interest, Royal Dutch Shell Company a quarter-interest, and the Germans a quarter-interest; and (6) that both Powers would support the \"open-door\" policy in commercial activities in Asiatic Turkey. Unfortunately, this agreement, as well as the earlier ones with other Powers, became worthless with the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. However, it is still important to recognize that the Entente Powers forced upon the Germans a settlement dividing Turkey into \"spheres of interest\" in place of the projected German settlement based on international cooperation in the economic reconstruction of the area. These struggles of the Great Powers for profit and influence in the wreckage of the Ottoman Empire could not fail to have profound ef- fects in Turkish domestic affairs. Probably the great mass of the sultan's subjects were still untouched by these events, but an animated minority was deeply stirred. This minority received no encouragement from the despotic Abdul-Hamid II, sultan from 1876 to 1909. While eager for economic improvements, Abdul-Hamid II was opposed to the spread of the Western ideas of liberalism, constitutionalism, nationalism, or de- mocracy, and did all he could to prevent their propagation by censorship! by restrictions on foreign travel or study abroad by Turks, and by an elaborate system of arbitrary police rule and governmental espionage. As a result, the minority of liberal, nationalistic, or progressive Turks had to organize abroad. This they did at Geneva in 1891 in a group which is generally known as the \"Young Turks.\" Their chief difficulty was to reconcile the animosities which existed between the many linguistic groups among the sultan's subjects. This was done in a series of congresses held in Paris, notably in 1902 and in 1907. At the latter meeting were representatives of the Turks, Armenians, Bulgars, Jews, Arabs, and Albanians. In the meantime, this secret organization had penetrated the sultan's army, which was seething with discontent. The plotters were so successful that they were able to revolt in July 1908, and force the sultan to reestablish the Constitution of 1876. At once divisions appeared among the rebel leaders, notably between those who wished a centralized state and those who accepted the subject nationalities' demands for de- centralization. Moreover, the orthodox Muslims formed a league to resist secularization, and the army soon saw that its chief demands for better pay and improved living conditions were not going to be met. Abdul- Hamid took advantage of these divisions to organize a violent counter- revolution (April 1909). It was crushed, the sultan was deposed, and the Young Turks began to impose their ideas of a dictatorial Turkish national state with ruthless severity. A wave of resistance arose from the non' Turkish groups and the orthodox Muslims. No settlement of these dis- putes was achieved by the outbreak of the World War in 1914.

The British Imperial Crisis: Africa, Ireland, and India to 1926 INTRODUCTION . \"e old statement that England acquired its empire in a fit of absent- uedness is amusing but does not explain very much. It does, however, . am an element of truth: much of the empire was acquired by private 'viduals and commercial firms, and was taken over by the British gov- ment much later. The motives which impelled the government to ex areas which its citizens had been exploiting were varied, both une and in place, and were frequently much different from what an °«tsider might believe. ntain acquired the world's greatest empire because it possessed certain Vantages which other countries lacked. We mention three of these antages: (i) that it was an island, (2) that it was in the Atlantic, and i) that its social traditions at home produced the will and the talents ^imperial acquisition. • s an island off the coast of Europe, Britain had security as long as , * control of the narrow seas. It had such control from the defeat e Spanish Armada in 1588 until the creation of new weapons based air power in the period after 1935. The rise of the German Air f\\; Ce Un ^ er Hitler, the invention of the long-range rocket projectiles \" 2 Weapon) in 1944, and the development of the atomic and hydrogen . 0s m 1945-195 5 destroved England's security by reducing the defen- i n e ^ ect i v eness of the English Channel. But in the period 1588-1942, , lc h Britain controlled the seas, the Channel gave England security made its international position entirely different from that of any mental Power. Because Britain had security, it had freedom of action. v n means it had a choice whether to intervene or to stay out of the j ° Us disputes which arose on the Continent of Europe or elsewhere e world. Moreover, if it intervened, it could do so on a limited com- ent, restricting its contribution of men, energy, money, and wealth ha ever amount it wished. If such a limited commitment were ex- ec » or lost, so long as the British fleet controlled the seas, Britain had"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"126  TRAGEDY AND HOPE security, and thus had freedom to choose if it would break off its inter- vention or increase its commitment. Moreover, England could make even a small commitment of its resources of decisive importance by using this commitment in support of the second strongest Power on the Continent against the strongest Power, thus hampering the strongest Power and making the second Power temporarily the strongest, as long as it acted in accord with Britain's wishes. In this way, by following balance-of-power tactics, Britain was able to plav a decisive role on the Continent, keep the Continent divided and embroiled in its own disputes, and do this with a limited commitment of Britain's own resources, leaving a considerable surplus of energy, manpower, and wealth available for acquiring an em- pire overseas. In addition, Britain's unique advantage in having security through a limited commitment of resources by control of the sea was one of the contributing factors which allowed Britain to develop its unique social structure, its parliamentary system, its wide range of civil liberties, and its great economic advance. The Powers on the Continent had none of these advantages. Since each could be invaded bv its neighbors at anv time, each had security, and thus freedom of action, only on rare and brief occasions. When the security of a continental Power was threatened by a neighbor, it had no freedom of action, but had to defend itself with all its resources. Clearly, it would be impossible for France to say to itself, \"We shall oppose German hegemony on the Continent only to the extent of 50,000 men of of $10 million.\" Vet as late as 1939, Chamberlain informed France that England's commitment on the Continent for this purpose would be no more than two divisions. Since the continental Powers had neither security nor freedom of action, their position on the Continent always was paramount over their ambitions for world empire, and these latter always had to be sacrificed for the sake of the former whenever a conflict arose. France was unable to hold on to its possessions in India or in North America in the eighteenth century because so much of its resources had to be used to bolster French security against Prussia or Austria. Napoleon sold Louisi- ana to the United States in 1803 because his primary concern had to be h' s position on the Continent. Bismarck tried to discourage Germany from embarking on any overseas adventures in the period after 1871 because he saw that Germany must be a continental power or be nothing. Again, France in 1882 had to yield Egvpt to Britain, and in 1898 had to yield the Sudan in the same way, because it saw that it could not engage in any' colonial dispute with Britain while the German Army stood across the Rhineland. This situation was so clear that all the lesser continental Pow- ers with overseas colonial possessions, such as Portugal, Belgium, or the Netherlands, had to collaborate with Britain, or, at the very least, be"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"THE BUFFER FRINGE  127   carefully neutral. So long as the ocean highway- from these countries to their overseas empires was controlled by the British fleet, they could not Word to embark on a policy hostile to Britain, regardless of their per- gonal feelings on the subject. It is no accident that Britain's most constant mternational backing in the two centuries following the Methuen Treaty 0 '7°3 came from Portugal and that Britain has felt free to nego- ' ate w 'ith a third Power, like Germany, regarding the disposition of the ortuguese colonies, as she did in 1898 and tried to do in 1937-1939. Britain's position on the Atlantic, combined with her naval control of fte sea, gave her a great advantage when the new lands to the west t that ocean became one of the chief sources of commercial and naval yealth in the period after 1588. Lumber, tar, and ships were supplied from le American colonies to Britain in the period before the advent of iron, s team-driven ships (after i860), and these ships helped to establish Brit- ain s mercantile supremacy. At the same time, Britain's insular position de- P wed her monarchy of any need for a large professional, mercenary army c n as the kings on the Continent used as the chief bulwark of royal ab- 0 utism. As a result, the kings of England were unable to prevent the tied gentry from taking over the control of the government in the pe- 1642-1690, and the kings of England became constitutional mon- , c ) s ; Britain's security behind her navy allowed this struggle to go to a cision without any important outside interference, and permitted a rivalry betw een monarch and aristocracy which would have been sui- al on the insecure grounds of continental Europe, \"tain's security combined with the political triumph of the landed igarchy to create a social tradition entirely unlike that on the Con- e nt. One result of these two factors was that England did not obtain a reaucracy such as appeared on the Continent. This lack of a separate e aucracy loyal to the monarch can be seen in the weakness of the essional army (already mentioned) and also in the lack of a bureau- , lc judicial system. In England, the gentry and the younger sons of 'anded oligarchy studied law in the Inns of Court and obtained a m g for tradition and the sanctity of due process of law while still Gaining a part of the landed class. In fact this class became the landed s in England just because they obtained control of the bar and the c n and were, thus, in a position to judge all disputes about real P perty i n their own favor.

The landed oligarchy which arose in England differed from the landed aristocracy of continental Europe in the three points already mentioned: (i) it got control of the government; (2) it was not opposed by a pro- fessional army, a bureaucracv, or a professional judicial system, but, on the contrary, it took over the control of these adjuncts of government it- self, generally serving without pav, and making access to these positions difficult for outsiders by making such access expensive; and (3) it obtained complete control of the land as well as political, religious, and social con- trol of the villages. In addition, the landed oligarchy of England was dif- ferent from that on the Continent because it was not a nobility. This lack was reflected in three important factors. On the Continent a noble was excluded from marrying outside his class or from engaging in commer- cial enterprise; moreover, access to the nobility by persons of nonnoble birth was very difficult, and could hardly be achieved in much less than three generations. In England, the landed oligarchy could engage in any kind of commerce or business and could marry anyone without question (provided she was rich); moreover, while access to the gentry in England was a slow process which might require generations of effort acquiring landholdings in a single locality, access to the peerage by act 01 the government took only a moment, and could be achieved on the basis of either wealth or service. As a consequence of all these differences, the landed upper class in England was open to the influx of new talent, ne*' money, and new blood, while the continental nobility was deprived o» these valuable acquisitions. While the landed upper class of England was unable to become a nobility (that is, a caste based on exalted birth), it was able to become an aristocracy (that is, an upper class distinguished by traditions and be havior). The chief attributes of this aristocratic upper class in Engla n£l were (1) that it should be trained in an expensive, exclusive, masculine- and relatively Spartan educational system centering about the great boV s schools like Eton, Harrow, or Winchester; (2) that it should imbibe frofl 1 this educational system certain distinctive attitudes of leadership, courage- sportsmanship, team play, self-sacrifice, disdain for physical comforts, afl d devotion to duty; (3) that it should be prepared in later life to devote a great deal of time and energy to unpaid tasks of public significance, * s justices of the peace, on county councils, in the county militia, or in other services. Since all the sons of the upper classes received the same training- while only the oldest, by primogeniture, was entitled to take over the income-yielding property of the family, all the younger sons had to g° out into the world to seek their fortunes, and, as likely as not, would do their seeking overseas. At the same time, the uneventful life of the"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"THE BUFFER FRINGE  120  ypical English village or county, completely controlled bv the upper- c ass oligarchy, made it necessary for the more ambitious members of the ower classes to seek advancement outside the countv and even outside ngland. From these two sources were recruited the men who acquired ^Wain's empire and the men who colonized it. 1 he English have not always been unanimous in regarding the empire as a source of pride and benefit. In fact, the middle generation of the ni neteenth century was filled with persons, such as Gladstone, who re- garded the empire with profound suspicion. They felt that it was a source of great expense; they were convinced that it involved England in re mote strategic problems which could easily lead to wars England had 0 need to fight; they could see no economic advantage in having an ern pire, since the existence of free trade (which this generation accepted) Would allow commerce to flow no matter who held colonial areas; they VVe te convinced that any colonial areas, no matter at what cost thev might be acquired, would eventually separate from the mother country, untarily if they were given the rights of Englishmen, or by rebellion, as the American colonies had done, if they were deprived of such rights. n general, the \"Little Englanders,\" as they were called, were averse 0 colonial expansion on the grounds of cost. Although upholders of the \"Little England\" point of view, men like Gladstone or Sir William Harcourt, continued in political prominence ntil 1895, this point of view was in steady retreat after 1870. In the -•beral Party the Little Englanders were opposed by imperialists like Lord Rosebery even before 1895; after that date, a younger group of 'niperialists, like Asquith, Grey, and Haldane took over the party. In the Conservative Party, where the anti-imperialist idea had never been strong, noderate imperialists like Lord Salisbury were followed by more active ] niperialists like Joseph Chamberlain, or Lords Curzon, Selborne, and ( nlner. There were many factors which led to the growth of imperialism * te r 1870, and many obvious manifestations of that growth. The Royal Colonial Institute was founded in 1868 to fight the \"Little England\" idea; Israeli as prime minister (1874-1880) dramatized the profit and glamour °* empire by such acts as the purchase of control of the Suez Canal and > r granting Queen Victoria the title of Empress of India; after 1870 oecame increasingly evident that, however expensive colonies might be 0 a government, they could be fantastically profitable to individuals and companies supported by such governments; moreover, with the spread ot democracy and the growing influence of the press and the expanding ced for campaign contributions, individuals who made fantastic profits in v ' e rseas adventures could obtain favorable support from their govern- ments by contributing some part of their profits to politicians' expenses; e e fforts of King Leopold II of Belgium, using Henry Stanley, to obtain le Congo area as his own preserve in 1876-1880, started a contagious"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"13\"  TRAGEDY AND HOPE fever of colony-grabbing in Africa which lasted for more than thirty years; the discovery of diamonds (in 1869) and of gold (in 1886) in South Africa, especially in the Boer Transvaal Republic, intensified this lever. The new imperialism after 1870 was quite different in tone from that which the Little Englanders had opposed earlier. The chief changes were that it was justified on grounds of moral duty and of social reform and not, as earlier, on grounds of missionary activity and material advantage- The man most responsible for this change was John Ruskin. Until 1870 there was no professorship of fine arts at Oxford, but in that year, thanks to the Slade bequest, John Ruskin was named to such a chair. He hit Oxford like an earthquake, not so much because he talked about fine arts, but because he talked also about the empire and Eng- land's downtrodden masses, and above all because he talked about all three of these things as moral issues. Until the end of the nineteenth century the poverty-stricken masses in the cities of England lived in want, ig\" norance, and crime very much as they have been described by Charles Dickens. Ruskin spoke to the Oxford undergraduates as members of the privileged, ruling class. He told them that they were the possessors of a magnificent tradition of education, beauty, rule of law, freedom, decency, and self-discipline but that this tradition could not be saved, and did not deserve to be saved, unless it could be extended to the lower classes m England itself and to the non-English masses throughout the world. I' this precious tradition were not extended to these two great majorities, the minority of upper-class Englishmen would ultimately be submerged by these majorities and the tradition lost. To prevent this, the tradition must be extended to the masses and to the empire. Ruskin's message had a sensational impact. His inaugural lecture was copied out in longhand by one undergraduate, Cecil Rhodes, who kept it with him for thirty years. Rhodes (1853-1902) feverishly exploited the diamond and goldfields of South Africa, rose to be prime minister 01 the Cape Colony (1890-1896), contributed money to political parties, controlled parliamentary seats both in England and in South Africa, art\" sought to win a strip of British territory across Africa from the Cape o» Good Hope to Egvpt and to join these two extremes together with a telegraph line and ultimately with a Cape-to-Cairo Railway. Rhodes inspired devoted support for his goals from others in South Africa and i° England. With financial support from Lord Rothschild and Alfred Beit' he was able to monopolize the diamond mines of South Africa as De Beer Consolidated Mines and to build up a great gold mining enterprise as Con- solidated Gold Fields. In the middle 1890's Rhodes had a personal i°' come of at least a million pounds sterling a year (then about five mill' 011 dollars) which was spent so freely for his mysterious purposes that he W» usually overdrawn on his account. These purposes centered on his desif e"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"THE BUFFER FRINGE  I 3 I to federate the English-speaking peoples and to bring all the habitable portions of the world under their control. For this purpose Rhodes left Part of his great fortune to found the Rhodes Scholarships at Oxford J\" order to spread the English ruling class tradition throughout the English-speaking world as Ruskin had wanted. Among Ruskin's most devoted disciples at Oxford were a group of Wtimate friends including Arnold Toynbee, Alfred (later Lord) Milner, Arthur Glazebrook, George (later Sir George) Parkin, Philip Lyttelton -*£\", and Henry (later Sir Henry) Birchenough. These were so moved y Ruskin that they devoted the rest of their lives to carrying out ls ideas. A similar group of Cambridge men including Reginald Baliol Bre tt (Lord Esher), Sir John B. Seeley, Albert (Lord) Grey, and Ed- und Garrett were also aroused by Ruskin's message and devoted their !ves to extension of the British Empire and uplift of England's urban as ses as two parts of one project which they called \"extension of the • n gush-speaking idea.\" They were remarkably successful in these aims ec ause England's most sensational journalist William T. Stead (1849- QI *)> an ardent social reformer and imperialist, brought them into asso- ation with Rhodes.

In the meantime, in 1884, acting under Ruskin's inspiration, a group which included Arnold Toynbee, Milner, Gell, Grey, Seeley, and Michael Glazebrook founded the first \"settlement house,\" an organization by which educated, upper-class people could live in' the slums in order to assist, instruct, and guide the poor, with particular emphasis on social welfare and adult education. The new enterprise, set up in East London with P. L. Gell as chairman, was named Toynbee Hall after Arnold Toynbee who died, aged 31, in 1883. This was the original model for the thousands of settlement houses, such as Hull House in Chicago, now found throughout the world, and was one of the seeds from which the modern movement for adult education and university extension grew. As governor-general and high commissioner of South Africa in the period 1897-1905, Milner recruited a group of young men, chiefly from Oxford and from Toynbee Hall, to assist him in organizing his adminis- tration. Through his influence these men were able to win influential posts in government and international finance and became the dominant influ- ence in British imperial and foreign affairs up to 1939. Under Milner in South Africa they were known as Milner's Kindergarten until 1910. In 1909-1913 they organized semisecret groups, known as Round Table Groups, in the chief British dependencies and the United States. These still function in eight countries. They kept in touch with each other by personal correspondence and frequent visits, and through an influential quarterly magazine, The Round Table, founded in 1910 and largely sup- ported by Sir Abe Bailey's money. In 1919 they founded the Royal Insti- tute of International Affairs (Chatham House) for which the chief financial supporters were Sir Abe Bailey and the Astor family (owners of The Times). Similar Institutes of International Affairs were established in the chief British dominions and in the United States (where it is known as the Council on Foreign Relations) in the period 1919-1927. After 192.? a somewhat similar structure of organizations, known as the Institute 01 Pacific Relations, was set up in twelve countries holding territory in the Pacific area, the units in each British dominion existing on an inter- locking basis with the Round Table Group and the Royal Institute 01 International Affairs in the same country. In Canada the nucleus of th' s group consisted of Milner's undergraduate friends at Oxford (such as Arthur Glazebrook and George Parkin), while in South Africa and India the nucleus was made up of former members of Milner's Kindergarten. These included (Sir) Patrick Duncan, B. K.

The power and influence ot this Rhodes-.Milner group in British imperial affairs and in foreign policy since 1889, although not widely recognized, can hardly be ex- aggerated. We might mention as an example that this group dominated \" e Times from 1890 to 1912 and has controlled it completely since 012 (except for the years 1919-1922). Because The Times has been vied by the Astor family since 1922, this Rhodes-.Milner group was sometimes spoken of as the \"Cliveden Set,\" named after the Astor country ouse where they sometimes assembled. Numerous other papers and journals have been under the control or influence of this group since °9- They have also established and influenced numerous university and ler chairs of imperial affairs and international relations. Some of these are the Beit chairs at Oxford, the .Montague Burton chair at Oxford, the \"odes chair at London, the Stevenson chair at Chatham House, the Wil- n c hair at Aberystwyth, and others, as well as such important sources of influence as Rhodes House at Oxford, ^rom 1884 to about 1915 the members of this group worked valiantly extend the British Empire and to organize it in a federal system.

They also hoped to bring the United States 0 this organization to whatever degree was possible. Stead was able get Rhodes to accept, in principle, a solution which might have made ashington the capital of the whole organization or allow parts of the •^pire to become states of the American Union. The varied character of e British imperial possessions, the backwardness of many of the native Peoples involved, the independence of many of the white colonists over- as, and the growing international tension which culminated in the First orld War made it impossible to carry out the plan for Imperial Fed- ation, although the five colonies in Australia were joined into the Com- monwealth of Australia in 1901 and the four colonies in South Africa ' er e joined into the Union of South Africa in 1910.

This was clearly true in Africa where such motivations gradually extended British control south- ward from Egypt and northward from the Cape until these were joined in central Africa with the conquest of German Tanganyika in 1916. The extravagances of the Khedive Ismail (1863-1879), which had com- pelled the sale of his Suez Canal shares, led ultimately to the creation of an Anglo-French condominium to manage the Egyptian foreign debt and to the deposition of the khedive by his suzerain, the Sultan of Turkey. The condominium led to disputes and finally to open fighting between Egyptian nationalists and Anglo-French forces. When the French refused to join the British in a joint bombardment of Alexandria in 1882, the condominium was broken, and Britain reorganized the country in such a fashion that, while all public positions were held by Egyptians, a British army was in occupation, British \"advisers\" controlled all the chief governmental posts, and a British \"resident,\" Sir Evelyn Baring (known as Lord Cromer after 1892), controlled all finances and really ruled the country until 1907. Inspired by fanatical Muslim religious agitators (dervishes), the Mahdi Muhammad Ahmed led a Sudanese revolt against Egyptian control in 1883, massacred a British force under General Charles (\"Chinese\") Gor- don at Khartoum, and maintained an independent Sudan for fifteen years. In 1898 a British force under (Lord) Kitchener, seeking to protect the Nile water supply of Egypt, fought its way southward against fanatical Sudanese tribesmen and won a decisive victory at Omdurman. An Anglo- Egvptian convention established a condominium known as the Anglo- Egyptian Sudan in the area between Egypt and the Congo River. This area, which had lived in disorder for centuries, was gradually pacified, brought under the rule of law, irrigated by extensive hydraulic works, and brought under cultivation, producing, chiefly, long staple cotton. EAST CENTRAL AFRICA TO I9IO South and east of the Sudan the struggle for a British Africa was largely in the hands of H. H. (Sir Harry) Johnston (1858-1927) and Fred- erick (later Lord) Lugard (1858-1945). These two, chiefly using private funds but frequently holding official positions, fought all over tropical Africa, ostensibly seeking to pacify it and to wipe out the Arab slave trade, but always possessing a burning desire to extend British rule. Frequently, these ambitions led to rivalries with supporters of French and German ambitions in the same regions. In 1884 Johnston obtained many concessions from native chiefs in the Kenya area, turning these over to the British East Africa Company in 1887.

Khodes's plans received a terrible blow in 1890-1891 when Lord lsbury sought to end the African disputes with Germany and Portugal y delimiting their territorial claims in South and East Africa. The ortuguese agreement of 1891 was never ratified, but the Anglo-German a g r eement of 1890 blocked Rhodes's route to Egypt by extending Ger- an East Africa (Tanganyika) west to the Belgium Congo. By the same greernent Germany abandoned Nyasaland, Uganda, and Zanzibar to \"tain in return for the island of Heligoland in the Baltic Sea and an vantageous boundary in German Southwest Africa. As soon as the German agreement was published, Lugard was sent by e British East Africa Company to overcome the resistance of native ler s and slavers in Uganda (1890-1894). The bankruptcy of this com- pany in 1895 seemed likely to lead to the abandonment of Uganda be- ause of the Little Englander sentiment in the Liberal Party (which was office in 1892-1895). Rhodes offered to take the area over himself and n ll f° r ;£-5iOoo a year, but was refused.

With great per- sonal daring, unscrupulous opportunism, and extravagant expenditure of money, Rhodes obtained an opening to the north, passing west of the Boer republics, by getting British control in Griqualand West (1880), Bechuanaland, and the Bechuanaland Protectorate (1885). In 1888 Rhodes obtained a vague but extensive mining concession from the Matabeles' chief, Lobengula, and gave it to the British South Africa Company or- ganized for the purpose (1889). Rhodes obtained a charter so worded that the company had very extensive powers in an area without any northern limits beyond Bechuanaland Protectorate. Four years later the Matabeles were attacked and destroyed by Dr. Jameson, and their lands taken by the company. The company, however, was not a commercial success, and paid no dividends for thirty-five years (1889-1924) and only 12.5 shillings in forty-six years. This compares with 793.5 percent divi- dends paid by Rhodes's Consolidated Gold Fields in the five years 1889- 1894 and the 125 percent dividend it paid in 1896. Most of the South Af- rica Company's money was used on public improvements like roads and schools, and no rich mines were found in its territory (known as Rhodesia) compared to those farther south in the Transvaal. In spite of the terms of the Rhodes wills, Rhodes himself was not a racist. Nor was he a political democrat. He worked as easily and as closely with Jews, black natives, or Boers as he did with English. But he had a passionate belief in the value of a liberal education, and was at- tached to a restricted suffrage and even to a nonsecret ballot. In South Africa he was a staunch friend of the Dutch and of the blacks, found h' s chief political support among the Boers, until at least 1895, and wanted restrictions on natives put on an educational rather than on a color basis- These ideas have generally been held by his group since and have played an important role in British imperial history. His greatest weakness rested on the fact that his passionate attachment to his goals made him overly tolerant in regard to methods. He did not hesitate to use either bribery or force to attain his ends if he judged they would be effective. This weakness led to his greatest errors, the Jameson Raid of 1895 and the Boer War of 1899-1902, errors which were disastrous for the future of the empire he loved. SOUTH AFRICA, 1895-I933 By 1895 the Transvaal Republic presented an acute problem.

At H s point in 1895, Rhodes made his plans to overthrow Kruger's govern- ment by an uprising in Johannesburg, financed by himself and Beit, and ed by his brother Frank Rhodes, Abe Bailey, and other supporters, lowed by an invasion of the Transvaal bv a force led by Jameson from tfechuanaland and Rhodesia. Flora Shaw used The Thnes to prepare public opinion in England, while Albert Grey and others negotiated with Wonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain for the official support that was ecessary. Unfortunately, when the revolt fizzled out in Johannesburg, Jameson raided anyway in an effort to revive it, and was easily captured y the Boers. The public officials involved denounced the plot, loudly Proclaimed their surprise at the event, and were able to whitewash most ot the participants in the subsequent parliamentary inquiry. A telegram torn the German Kaiser to President Kruger of the Transvaal, con- gratulating him on his success \"in preserving the independence of his country without the need to call for aid from his friends,\" was built up } T The Times into an example of brazen German interference in British \"airs, and almost eclipsed Jameson's aggression. Rhodes was stopped only temporarily, but he had lost the support of many 0 f the Boers. For almost two years he and his friends stayed quiet, Waiting for the storm to blow over. Then they began to act again. Propa- ganda, most of it true, about the plight of Uitlanders in the Transvaal Republic flooded England and South Africa from Flora Shaw, W. T. ^tead, Edmund Garrett, and others; Milner was made high commissioner °t South Africa (1897); Brett worked his way into the confidence of the monarchy to become its chief political adviser during a period of more than twenty-five years (he wrote almost daily letters of advice to King Edward during his reign, 1901-1910).

The ability of 40,000 Boer farmers to hold off ten times as many British for three years, inflicting; a series of defeats on them over that period, destroyed faith in British power. Although the Boer republics were defeated and annexed in 1902, Britain's confidence was so shaken that it made a treaty with Japan in the same year providing that if either signer became engaged in war with two enemies in the Far East the other signer would come to the rescue. This treaty, which allowed Japan to attack Russia in 1904, lasted for twenty years, being extended to the Middle East in 1912. At the same time Germany's obvious sympathy with the Boers, combined with the German naval construction program of 1900, alienated the British people from the Germans and contributed greatly toward the Anglo-French entente of 1904. Milner took over the two defeated Boer republics and administered them as occupied territory until 1905, using a civil service of young men recruited for the purpose. This group, known as \"Milner's Kindergarten,\" reorganized the government and administration of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony and plaved a major role in South African life gen- erally. When Milner left public life in 1905 to devote himself to inter- national finance and the Rhodes enterprises, Lord Selborne, his successor as high commissioner, took over the Kindergarten and continued to use it. In 1906 a new Liberal government in London granted self-government to the two Boer states. The Kindergarten spent the next four years in a successful effort to create a South African Federation. The task was not an easy one, even with such powerful backing as Selborne, Smuts (who was now the dominant political figure in the Transvaal, although Botha held the position of prime minister), and Jameson (who was th e prime minister of the Cape Colony in 1904-1908). The subject was broached through a prearranged public interchange of letters between Jameson and Selborne. Then Selborne published a memorandum, written by Philip Kerr (Lothian) and Lionel Curtis, calling for a union of the four colonies. Kerr founded a periodical ( The State, financed by Sir Abe Bailey) which advocated federation in every issue; Curtis and others scurried about organizing \"Closer Union\" societies; Robert H. (Lord) Brand and (Sir) Patrick Duncan laid the groundwork for the new constitution. At the Durban constitutional convention (where Duncan and B. K. Long were legal advisers) the Transvaal delegation was con- trolled by Smuts and the Kindergarten. This delegation, which waS heavily financed, tightly organized, and knew exactly what it wantedi dominated the convention, wrote the constitution for the Union of South Africa, and succeeded in having it ratified (1910).

In 1S they were mistaken, because, as men like Jameson (1917), Botha ( ,0I 9), Duncan (1943), Long (1943), and Smuts (1950) died off, they 'ere not replaced by men of equal loyalty and ability, with the result that le \" oe r extremists under D. F. Malan came to power in 1948. I he first Cabinet of the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910 by e South African Party, which was largely Boer, with Louis Botha as P mie minister. The real master of the government was Smuts, who held ree out of nine portfolios, all important ones, and completely dominated otha. Their policy of reconciliation with the English and of loval sup- ' rt r tne British connection was violently opposed by the Boer ationalists within the party led by J. B. M. Hertzog. Hertzog was eager get independence from Britain and to reserve political control in a uth African republic to Boers only. He obtained growing support y agitating on the language and educational issues, insisting that all ? Vern ment officials must speak Afrikaans and that it be a compulsory lan gua ge in schools, with English a voluntary, second language. he opposition parry, known as Unionist, was largely English and was °y Jameson supported by Duncan, Richard Feetham, Hugh Wynd- 'n. and Long. Financed by Milner's allies and the Rhodes Trust, its ers considered that their chief task was \"to support the prime minister feainst the extremists of his own party.\" Long, as the best speaker, was ered to attack Hertzog constantly. When Hertzog struck back with 0 Solent language in 1912, lie was dropped from the Cabinet and soon c eded from the South African Party, joining with the irreconcilable °er republicans like Christiaan De Wet to form the Nationalist Party. e new party adopted an extremist anti-English and anti-native platform. Jameson's party, under his successor. Sir Thomas Smartt (a paid agent ne Rhodes organization), had dissident elements because of the growth white labor unions which insisted on anti-native legislation. By 1914 s e formed a separate Labour Party under F. H. P. Creswell, and were , e to w in from Smuts a law excluding natives from most semiskilled or ed work or any high-paying positions (1911). The natives were pelled to work for wages, however low, by the need to obtain cash taxes and by the inadequacy of the native reserves to support them 01 tn cir own agricultural activities. By the Land Act of 1913 about Percent of the land area was reserved for future land purchases by 'ves and the other 93 percent for purchase by whites. At that time the ' Ve population exceeded the whites by at least fourfold. s a result of such discriminations, the wages of natives were about one-"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"140  TRAGEDY AND HOPE tenth those of whites. This discrepancy in remuneration permitted white workers to earn salaries comparable to those earned in North America, although national income was low and productivity per capita was very low (about $125 per year). The Botha-Smuts government of 1910-1924 did little to cope with the almost insoluble problems which faced South Africa. As it became weaker, and the Hertzog Nationalists grew stronger, it had to rely with increasing frequency on the support of the Unionist party. In 1920 a coalition was formed, and three members of the Unionist party, including Duncan, took seats in Smuts's Cabinet. In the next election in 1924 Cresswell's Labourites and Hertzog's Nationalists formed an agreement which dropped the republican-imperial issue and emphasized the importance of economic and native questions. This alliance defeated Smuts's party and formed a Cabinet which held office for nine years. It was replaced in March 1933 by a Smuts-Hertzog coalition formed to deal with the economic crisis arising from the world depression of 1929-1935. The defeat of the Smuts group in 1924 resulted from four factors, be- sides his own imperious personality. These were (1) his violence toward labor unions and strikers; (2) his strong support for the imperial connec- tion, especially during the war of 1914-1918; (3) his refusal to show any enthusiasm for an anti-native program, and (4) the economic hardships of the postwar depression and the droughts of 1919-192 3. A miners strike in 1913 was followed by a general strike in 1914; in both, Smuts used martial law and machine-gun bullets against the strikers and in the latter case illegally deported nine union leaders to England. This prob- lem had hardly subsided before the government entered the war against Germany and actively participated in the conquest of German Africa as well as in the fighting in France. Opposition from Boer extremists to this evidence of the English connection was so violent that it resulted in ope 11 revolt against the government and mutiny by various military con- tingents which sought to join the small German forces in Southwest Africa. The rebels were crushed, and thousands of their supporters lost their political rights for ten years. Botha and, even more, Smuts played major roles in the Imperial Wat Cabinet in London and at the Peace Conference of 1919. The fornix died as soon as he returned home, leaving Smuts, as prime minister, to face the acute postwar problems. The economic collapse of 1920-10*3 was especially heavy in South Africa as the ostrich-feather and diamond markets were wiped out, the gold and export markets were badly i°' jured, and years of drought were prevalent. Efforts to reduce costs in the mines by increased use of native labor led to strikes and eventually to a revolution on the Rand (1922). Over 200 rebels were killed.

These political shifts in South Africa's domestic affairs did little to relieve any of the acute economic and social problems which faced that country. On the contrary these grew worse year by year. In 1921 the Union had only 1.5 million whites, 4.7 million natives, 545 thousand mulattoes (\"coloured\"), and 166 thousand Indians. By 1936 the whites d increased by only half a million, while the number of natives had gone up almost two million. These natives lived on inadequate and eroded reserves or in horrible urban slums, and were drastically re- tricted in movements, residence, or economic opportunities, and had most no political or even civil rights.

Moreover, the cheapness of un- skilled labor, especially on the farms, meant that most work was left to blacks, and many whites fell into lazy habits.

The Cornish miners struck for higher pay, but the Blacks, who in doing the drudgery had learned how to work the drills, kept the min £S running at a lower cost.\" Accordingly, the Milner-Round Table group worked out a scheme to reserve the tropical portions of Africa north of the Zambezi River f° r natives under such attractive conditions that the blacks south of th* river would be enticed to migrate northward. As Curtis envisioned th' s plan, an international state or administrative body \"would take over tn British, French, Belgian, and Portuguese dependencies in trop lC ' ;1 Africa. ...

This tradition was a catJy strengthened by the actions of the Rhodes-Milner group, pecially after 1920. Rhodes aroused considerable ill-feeling among whites of South Africa when he announced that his program in- ded \"equal rights for all civilized men south of the Zambezi,\" and n t on to indicate that \"civilized men\" included ambitious, literate jjegroes. When Milner took over the Boer states in 1901, he tried to fol- v the same policy. The peace treaty of 1902 promised that the native n chise would not be forced on the defeated Boers, but Milner tried organize the governments of municipalities, beginning with Johan- Ur g, so that natives could vote. This was blocked by the Kinder- en (led by Curtis who was in charge of municipal reorganization in .!~'9 0 6) because they considered reconciliation with the Boers as a r uninary to a South African Union to be more urgent. Similarly, 0 ut s as the chief political figure in South Africa after 1910 had to / down native rights in order to win Boer and English labor support °r the rest of his program. ^ e Rhodes-Milner group, however, was in a better position to carry 'ts plans in the non-self-governing portions of Africa outside the . on - In South Africa the three native protectorates of Swaziland, 1 uanaland, and Basutoland were retained by the imperial authorities f f i reas xvner e native rights were paramount and where tribal forms ving could be maintained at least partially.

It also left the mines without any assured labor supply so that it became necessary to recruit contract labor farther and farther north. Efforts by the Union government to set northern limits beyond which labor recruiting was forbidden led to controversy with employers, fre- quent changes in regulations, and widespread evasions. As a conse- quence of an agreement made by Milner with Portuguese authorities, about a quarter of the natives working in South African mines came from Portuguese East Africa even as late as 1936. MAKIXG THE COMMONWEALTH, IQIO-IQ26 As soon as South Africa was united in 1910, the Kindergarten re- turned to London to try to federate the whole empire by the same methods. They were in a hurry to achieve this before the war with Germany which they believed to be approaching. With Abe Baile)' money they founded The Round Table under Kerr's (Lothian's) editor- ship, met in formal conclaves presided over by Milner to decide the fate of the empire, and recruited new members to their group, chiefly from New College, of which Milner was a fellow. The new recruits included a historian, F. S. Oliver, (Sir) Alfred Zimmern, (Sir) Reginald Coupland, Lord Lovat, and Waldorf (Lord) Astor. Curtis and others were sent around the world to organize Round Table groups in the chief British dependencies. For several years (1910-1916) the Round Table groups worked des- perately trying to find an acceptable formula for federating the empire^ Three books and many articles emerged from these discussions, but gradually it became clear that federation was not acceptable to the English-speaking dependencies. Gradually, it was decided to dissolve a\" formal bonds between these dependencies, except, perhaps, allegiance to the Crown, and depend on the common outlook of Englishmen to keep the empire together. This involved changing the name \"British Empire to \"Commonwealth of Nations,\" as in the title of Curtis's book of 19 1 \"' giving the chief dependencies, including India and Ireland, their com- plete independence (but gradually and by free gift rather than under duress), working to bring the United States more closely into this sam e orientation, and seeking to solidify the intangible links of sentiment by propaganda among financial, educational, and political leaders in eaci country. Efforts to bring the dependencies into a closer relationship with the mother country were by no means new in 1910, nor were they sup' ported only by the Rhodes-Milner group. Nevertheless, the actions ° this group were all-pervasive. The poor military performance of Brit' s forces during the Boer War led to the creation of a commission t0 investigate the South African War, with Lord Esher (Brett) as ch lir '"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"THE BUFFER FRINGE  145  man (1903). Among other items, this commission recommended creation °f a permanent Committee of Imperial Defence. Esher became (unoffi- ^ a ') chairman of this committee, holding the position for the rest of is lif e (1905-1930). He was able to establish an Imperial General Staff in '907 and to get a complete reorganization of the military forces of e w Zealand, Australia, and South Africa so that they could be incor- porated into the imperial forces in an emergency (1909-1912). On the committee itself he created an able secretariat which cooperated loyally vith the Rhodes-Milner group thereafter. These men included (Sir) ', au \" Ce (later Lord) Hankey and (Sir) Ernest Swinton (who invented e tank in 1915). When, in 1916-1917, Milner and Esher persuaded the .net to create a secretariat for the first time, the task was largely given to this secretariat from the Committee on Imperial Defence. Thus ankey was secretary to the committee for thirty years (1908-1938), to e Cabinet for twenty-two years (1916-1938), clerk to the Privy Coun- ter fifteen years (1923-1938), secretary-general of the five imperial Terences held between 1921 and 1937, secretary to the British delega- n to almost every important international conference held between c Versailles Conference of 1919 and the Lausanne Conference of 1932, °ne of the leading advisers to the Conservative governments after '939-      B      nn l 1907 the overseas portions of the Empire (except India) eom- iicated with the imperial government through the secretary of state colonies. To supplement this relationship, conferences of the prime ls ters of the self-governing colonies were held in London to discuss °mmon problems in 1887, 1897, 1902, 1907, 1911, 1917, and 1918. In 9°7 it was decided to hold such conferences every four years, to call e Se lf-governing colonies \"Dominions,\" and to by-pass the Colonial cretary by establishing a new Dominion Department. Ruskin's influ- ce > among others, could be seen in the emphasis of the Imperial onterence of 1911 that the Empire rested on a triple foundation of W rule of law, (2) local autonomy, and (3) trusteeship of the in- ff sts an d fortunes of those fellow subjects who had not yet attained Self -government. ln e Conference of 1915 could not be held because of the war, but soon as Milner became one of the four members of the War Cabinet '915 his influence began to be felt everywhere. We have mentioned at he established a Cabinet secretariat in 1916-1917 consisting of two P r °teges of Esher (Hankey and Swinton) and two of his own (his ^cretaries, Leopold Amery and W. G. A.

He created an Imperial War Cabinet by adding"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"H 6  TRAGEDY AND HOPE Dominion Prime Ministers (particularly Smuts) to the United Kingdom War Cabinet. He also called the Imperial Conferences of 1917 and 1918 and invited the dominions to establish Resident Ministers in London. As the war drew to a close in 1918, Milner took the office of Colonial Secretary, with Amery as his assistant, negotiated an agreement provid- ing independence for Egypt, set up a new self-government constitution in Malta, sent Curtis to India (where he drew up the chief provisions of the Government of India Act of 1919), appointed Curtis to the post of Adviser on Irish Affairs (where he plaved an important role in granting dominion status to southern Ireland in 1921), gave Canada permission to establish separate diplomatic relations with the United States (the first minister being the son-in-law of Milner's closest collaborator on the Rhodes Trust), and called the Imperial Conference of 1921. During this decade 1919-1929 the Rhodes-Milner group gave the chief impetus toward transforming the British Empire into the Commonwealth of Nations and launching India on the road to responsible self-govern- ment. The creation of the Round Table groups by Milner's Kinder- garten in 1909-1913 opened a new day in both these fields, although the whole group was so secretive that, even today, many close students of the subject are not aware of its significance. These men had formed their intellectual growth at Oxford on Pericle's funeral oration as de- scribed in a book by a member of the group, (Sir) Alfred Zimmerns The Greek Conmion-voealth (1911), on Edmund Burke's On Conciliation ivith America, on Sir J. B. Seelev's Groivth of British Policy, on A. V« Dicev's The Laiv and Custom of the Constitution, and on The Ne r ^ Testamenfs \"Sermon on the Mount.\" The last was especially influential on Lionel Curtis. He had a fanatical conviction that with the proper spirit and the proper organization (local self-government and federal- ism), the Kingdom of God could be established on earth. He was sure that if people were trusted just a bit beyond what they deserve they would respond by proving worthy of such trust. As he wrote in '1 W Problem of a Commonwealth (1916), \"if political power is granted to groups before they are fit thev will tend to rise to the need.\" This W s the spirit which Milner's group tried to use toward the Boers in 1902' 1910, toward India in 1910-1947, and, unfortunately, toward Hitler i n 1933-1939. This point of view was reflected in Curtis's three volumes on world history, published as Civitas Dei in 1938. In the case of Hitler, 9* least, these high ideals led to disaster; this seems also to be the case m South Africa; whether this group succeeded in transforming the BritisD Empire into a Commonwealth of Nations or merely succeeded in « e ' stroying the British Empire is not yet clear, but one seems as likely a the other. That these ideas were not solely those of Curtis but were held '») the group as a whole will be clear to all who study it. When Lor"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"THE BUFFER FRINGE  I47  Lothian died in Washington in 1940, Curtis published a volume of his speeches and included the obituary which Grigg had written for The Round Table. Of Lothian this said, \"He held that men should strive to uud the Kingdom of Heaven here upon this earth, and that the leader- Sll P in that task must fall first and foremost upon the English-speaking Peoples.\" Other attitudes of this influential group can be gathered from f ( ° nie quotations from four books published by Curtis in 1916-1920: _ e rule of law as contrasted with the rule of an individual is the fSunguishing mark of the Commonwealth. In despotisms government es >ts on the authority of the ruler or of the invisible and uncontrollable P°\\ver behind him. In a commonwealth rulers derive their authority r °ni the law, and the law from a public opinion which is competent to lange it . . . The idea that the principle of the Commonwealth implies .'Uversal suffrage betrays an ignorance of its real nature. That principle ni P'y means that government rests on the duty of the citizens to each . ler i and is to be vested in those who are capable of setting public erests before their own. . . . The task of preparing for freedom the Ces which cannot as yet govern themselves is the supreme duty of mose who can. It is the spiritual end for which the Commonwealth • ls ts, and material order is nothing except as a means to it. . . . The P e °ples of India and Egypt, no less than those of the British Isles and °minions, must be gradually schooled in the management of their agonal affairs. . . . The whole effect of the war [of 1914-1918] has en to bring movements long gathering to a sudden head. . . . Com- P' nionship in arms has fanned . . . long smouldering resentment against e presumption that Europeans are destined to dominate the rest of World. In every part of Asia and Africa it is bursting into flames. • Personally I regard this challenge to the long unquestioned claim \"p white man to dominate the world as inevitable and wholesome, Pecially to ourselves. . . . The world is in the throes which precede at 'on or death. Our whole race has outgrown the merely national . e and, as surely as day follows night or night the dav, will pass er to a Commonwealth of Nations or else to an empire of slaves, \"d the issue of these agonies rests with us.\" n this spirit the Rhodes-Milner group tried to draw plans for a federa- of the British Empire in 1909-1916. Gradually this project was P aced or postponed in favor of the commonwealth project of free Peration. Milner seems to have accepted the lesser aim after a meet- s' sponsored by the Empire Parliamentary Association, on July 28, 1 at which he outlined the project for federation with many refer- c s to the writings of Curtis, but found that not one Dominion mem- 1. P re sent would accept it. At the Imperial Conference of 1917, under e guidance, it was resolved that \"any readjustment of constitutional rela- • • • should be based on a full recognition of the Dominions as"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"148  TRAGEDY AND HOPE autonomous nations of an Imperial Commonwealth and of India as an important portion of the same, should recognize the right of the Domin- ions and India to an adequate voice in foreign policy and in foreign re- lations, and should provide effective arrangements for continuous consultation in all important matters of common Imperial concern.\" Another resolution called for full representation for India in future Im- perial Conferences. This was done in 1918. At this second wartime Imperial Conference it was resolved that Prime Ministers of Dominions could communicate directly with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and that each dominion (and India) could establish Resident Ministers in London who would have seats on the Imperial War Cabinet^ Milner was the chief motivating force in these developments. He hope\" that the Imperial War Cabinet would continue to meet annually after the war but this did not occur. During these years 1917-1918, a declaration was drawn up establish- ing complete independence for the dominions except for allegiance to the crown. This was not issued until 1926. Instead, on July 9, 1919 Milner issued an official statement which said, \"The United Kingdom and the Dominions are partner nations; not vet indeed of equal power, but fo f good and all of equal status. . . . The only possibility of a continuance of the British Empire is on a basis of absolute out-and-out equal partner- ship between the United Kingdom and the Dominions. I say that with- out any kind of reservation whatsoever.\" This point of view was re- stated in the so-called Balfour Declaration of 1926 and was enacted int° law as the Statute of Westminster in 1931. B. K. Long of the South African Round Table group (who was Colonial Editor of The Tin* in 1913-1921 and Editor of Rhodes's paper, The Cape Times, in South Africa in 1922-1935) tells us that the provisions of the declaration 0 1926 were agreed on in 1917 during the Imperial Conference convoke by Milner. They were formulated by John W. Dafoe, editor of ch Winnipeg Free Press for 43 years and the most influential journap in Canada for much of that period. Dafoe persuaded the Canada Prime Minister, Sir Robert Borden, to accept his ideas and then brougW in Long and Dawson (Editor of The Times). Dawson negotiated tn agreement with Milner, Smuts, and others. Although Australia an New Zealand were far from satisfied, the influence of Canada and South Africa carried the agreement. Nine years later it was iss 11 under Balfour's name at a conference convoked by Amery.

It dominated the Colonial Office in London, east for the decade 1010-1020. There Alilner was secretary of state in t '^o-ion and Amery in 1924-1929, while the post of parliamentary er-secretary was ^ e ^ ^y z ^ Tee members of the group for most of e decade. Publicity for their views on civilizing the natives and aining them for eventual self-government received wide dissemination, ° only by official sources but also by the academic, scholarly, and journalistic organizations thev dominated. As examples of this we might le ntion the writings of Coupland, Hailey, Curtis, Grigg, Amery, and °thian, all Round Tablers. In 1938 Lord Hailey edited a gigantic vol- e °* 1*837 pages called An African Survey. This work was first sug- ? ste ° by Smuts at Rhodes House, Oxford, in 1929, had a foreword by \" ot hian, and an editorial board of Lothian, Hailey, Coupland, Curtis, others. It remains the greatest single book on modern Africa. These P eo P'e, and others, through The Times, The Round Table, The Ob- • ver, Chatham House, and other conduits, became the chief source of , eas on colonial problems in the English-speaking world. Nevertheless, v were unable to achieve their program. n Ae course of the 192o's the Round Table program for East Africa paralyzed by a debate on the priority which should be given to the ee aspects of the group's project for a Negro Dominion north of the uibezi. The three parts were (1) native rights, (2) \"Closer Union,\" p v3) international trusteeship. Generally, the group gave priority to ser Union (federation of Kenya with Uganda and Tanganyika), but ambiguity of their ideas on native rights made it possible for Dr. . P\" H. Oldham, spokesman for the organized Nonconformist mis- ary groups, to organize a successful opposition movement to federa- j of East Africa. In this effort Oldham found a powerful ally in a Lugard, and considerable support from other informed persons, Eluding Margery Perham. n e Round Tablers, who had no firsthand knowledge of native life even of tropical Africa, were devoted supporters of the English way , \" e i and could see no greater benefit conferred on natives than to P them to move in that direction.

The opposition to Closer Union in East Africa was successful in hold- ing up this project in spite of the Round Table domination of the Colonial Office, chiefly because of Prime Minister Baldwin's refusal to move quickly- This delayed change until the Labour government took over in 1929; in this the pro-native, nonconformist (especially Quaker) influence was stronger. The trusteeship issue came into this controversy because Britain was bound, as a mandate Power, to maintain native rights in Tanganyika to the satisfaction of the Mandates Commission of the League of Nations This placed a major obstacle in the path of Round Table efforts to join Tanganyika with Kenya and Uganda into a Negro Dominion which would be under quite a different kind of trusteeship of the Aft 1 ' can colonial Powers. Father south, in the Rhodesias and Nyasaland, the Round Table obsession with federation did not meet this obstacle, and that area was eventually federated, over native protests, in 1953, but this creation, the Central African Federation, broke up again in 196+ Strangely enough, the League of Nations Mandate System which be- came such an obstacle to the Round Table plans was largely a creation of the Round Table itself. The Milner Group used the defeat of Germany in 1918 as an opportn' nity to impose an international obligation on certain Powers to trea the natives fairly in the regions taken from Germany. This opportunity was of great significance because just at that time the earlier impetus i° this direction arising from missionaries was beginning to weaken as 3 consequence of the general weakening of religious feeling in European culture. The chief problem in East Africa arose from the position of the wh» settlers of Kenya. Although this colony rests directly on the equator- its interior highlands, 4,000 to 10,000 feet up, were well adapted t white settlement and to European agricultural methods. The situatio was dangerous by 1920, and grew steadily worse as the years passe < until by 1950 Kenya had the most critical native problem in Africa, differed from South Africa in that it lacked self-government, rich min e ' or a divided white population, but it had many common problem' such as overcrowded native reserves, soil erosion, and discontented an detribalized blacks working for low wages on lands owned by white • It had about two million blacks and only 3,000 whites in 1910.

Many 0 f these farms were of more than 30,000 acres and had been ob- ained from the government, either by purchase or on very long (999- y ear ) leases for only nominal costs (rents about two cents per year per ac re). The native reserves amounted to about 50,000 square miles of gen- erally poorer land, or five times as much land for the blacks, although they a d at least 150 times as many people. The Indians, chiefly in commerce a nd crafts, were so industrious that they gradually came to own most °f the commercial areas both in the towns and in the native reserves. *he two great subjects of controversy in Kenya were concernec vith the supply of labor and the problem of self-government, although ess agitated problems, like agricultural technology, sanitation, and edu- a tion were of vital significance. The whites tried to increase the pressure 0n natives to work on white farms rather than to seek to make a living n their own lands within the reserves, by forcing them to pay taxes . Cas h, by curtailing the size or quality of the reserves, by restricting ^Ptovemcnts in native agricultural techniques, and by personal and Political pressure and compulsion. The effort to use political compulsion ea ched a peak in 1919 and was stopped by Milner, although his group, ce Rhodes in South Africa, was eager to make natives more industri- s a nd more ambitious by any kinds of social, educational, or economic P re ssures. The settlers encouraged natives to live off the reserves in ar ious ways: for example, by permitting them to settle as squatters on ute estates in return for at least 180 days of work a year at the usual »? W u ' a ge rates. To help both black and white farmers, not only in en .Va hut throughout the world, Milner created, as a research organi- atl °n, an Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture at Trinidad in 1919. ^Vs a consequence of various pressures which we have mentioned, no- ' . v the need to pay taxes which averaged, perhaps, one month's wages . /Car and, in the aggregate, took from the natives a larger sum than at realized from the sale of native products, the percentage of adult es working off the reservations increased from about 35 percent in 925 to over 80 percent in 1940.

Tk     - • ne real crux of controversv before the Mau Mau uprising of 1948- 955 Was the problem of self-government.

The efforts to estab- lish an elective element in the Legislative Council in 1919-1923 resulted in violent controversy. The draft drawn by the council itself provided for only European members elected by a European electorate. Milnet added two Indian members elected by a separate Indian electorate. 1° the resulting controversy the settlers sought to obtain their origin 3 ' plan, while London sought a single electoral roll restricted in size by educational and property qualifications but without mention of race- To resist this, the settlers organized a Vigilance Committee and planned to seize the colony, abduct the governor, and form a republic federated in some way with South Africa. From this controversy came eventually a compromise, the famous Kenya White Paper of 1923, and the appoint' ment of Sir Edward Grigg as governor for the period of 1925-193'' The compromise gave Kenya a Legislative Council containing repre' sentatives of the imperial government, the white settlers, the Indians, the Arabs, and a white missionary to represent the blacks. Except for the settlers and Indians, most of these were nominated rather than elected, but by 1949, as the membership was enlarged, election was extended, and only the official and Negro members (4 out of 41) were nominated- The Kenya White Paper of 1923 arose from a specific problem in a single colony, but remained the formal statement of imperial policy jn tropical Africa.

About the same time efforts were made to extend the use of ative courts, native advisory councils, and to train natives for an ad- miI ustrative service.

INDIA TO 1926 n the decade 1910-1920, the two greatest problems to be faced in eating a Commonwealth of Nations were India and Ireland. There °e no doubt that India provided a puzzle infinitely more complex, ' *• Was more remote and less clearly envisioned, than Ireland. When the ' ls h East India Company became the dominant power in India about e middle of the eighteenth century, the Mogul Empire was in the last , £ e s of disintegration.

For these two reasons the areas under company rule, although not contiguous, expanded steadily until by 1858 they covered three-fifths of the country. Outside the British areas were over five hundred princely domains, some no large 1 than a single village but others as extensive as some states of Europe. At this point, in 1857-1858, a sudden, violent insurrection of native forces, known as the Great Mutiny, resulted in the end of the Mogu' Empire and of the East India Company, the British government taking over their political activities. From this flowed a number of important consequences. Annexation of native principalities ceased, leaving 5° : outside British India, but under British protection and subject to British intervention to ensure good government; within British India itsetti good government became increasingly dominant and commercial profit decreasingly so for the whole period 185 8-1947; British political pt eS ' tige rose to new heights from 1858 to 1890 and then began to dwindle* falling precipitously in 1919-192 2. The task of good government in India was not an easy one. In this great subcontinent with a population amounting to almost one-fifth ot the human race were to be found an almost unbelievable diversity °' cultures, religions, languages, and attitudes. Even in 1950 modern loco- motives linked together great cities with advanced industrial production by passing through jungles inhabited by tigers, elephants, and primiti v ' e pagan tribes. The population, which increased from 284 million in 19 01 to 389 million in 1941 and reached 530 million in 1961, spoke more tha 11 a dozen major languages divided into hundreds of dialects, and vvet e members of dozens of antithetical religious beliefs. There were, in 194 1 ' 255 million Hindus, 92 million .Muslims, 6.3 million Christians, 5.7 milh° n Sikhs, 1.5 million Jains, and almost 26 million pagan animists of various kinds. In addition, the Hindus and even some of the non-Hindus we fe divided into four major hereditary castes subdivided into thousands °' subcastes, plus a lowest group of outcastes (\"untouchables\"), amount- ing to at least 30 million persons in 1900 and twice this number in 195 0 ' These thousands of groups were endogamous, practiced hereditary economic activities, frequently had distinctive marks or garb, and \\ve re usually forbidden to marry, eat or drink with, or even to associate wit\" 1 persons of different caste. Untouchables were generally forbidden to come in contact, even indirectly, with members of other groups an were, accordingly, forbidden to enter many temples or public build- ings, to draw water from the public wells, even to allow their shado^' to fall on any person of a different group, and were subject to otn e restrictions, all designed to avoid a personal pollution which could t,e removed only by religious rituals of varying degrees of elaborateness. Most subcastes were occupational groups covering all kinds of activit\"* so that there were hereditary groups of carrion collectors, thieves, high'"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"THE BUFFER FRINGE  I55  Wa y robbers, or murderers (thugs), as well as farmers, fishermen, store- keepers, drug mixers, or copper smelters. For most peoples of India, a ste was the most important fact of life, submerging their individuality 0 a group from which they could never escape, and regulating all ei r activities from birth to death. As a result, India, even as late as ; 9°o, was a society in which status was dominant, each individual hav- S a place in a group which, in turn, had a place in society. This P ac e, known to all and accepted by all, operated by established pro- cures in its relationships with other groups so that there was in spite diversity, a minimum of intergroup friction and a certain peaceful 0 erance so long as intergroup etiquette was known and accepted. ln e diversity of social groups and beliefs was naturally reflected in extraordinarily wide range of social behavior from the most de- 5 a ded and bestial activities based on crude superstitions to even more °unding levels of exalted spiritual self-sacrifice and cooperation. Al- °ugh the British refrained from interfering with religious practices, tn e course of the nineteenth century they abolished or greatly Uc ed the practice of thuggism (in which a secret caste strangled ' rar >gers in honor of the goddess Kali), suttee (in which the widow of . eceased Hindu was expected to destroy herself on his funeral pyre), anticide, temple prostitution, and child marriages. At the other ex- \" \"^i most Hindus abstained from all violence; many had such a P e ct for life that they would eat no meat, not even eggs, while a few rie d this belief so far that they would not molest a cobra about to pe, a mosquito about to sting, or even walk about at night, less they knowingly step on an ant or worm. Hindus, who considered cows so re d that the worse crime would be to cause the death of one (even y accident), who allowed millions of these beasts to have free run of c °untxy to the great detriment of cleanliness or standards of living, ° would not wear shoes of leather, and would rather die than taste r i ate pork and associated daily with Muslims who ate beef but con- e pigs to be polluting. In general, most Indians lived in abject 1 erty and want; only about one in a hundred could read in 1858, lle considerably less could understand the English language. The rwhelniing majority at that time were peasants, pressed down by rous taxes and rents, isolated in small villages unconnected by roads, decimated at irregular intervals by famine or disease, ntish rule in the period 1858-1947 tied India together by railroads, V«/ Zn ^ ^'egrap' 1 lines.

A certain degree of efficiency, and a certain ambitious, if dis- contented, energv directed toward change replaced the older abject resignation to inevitable fate. The modern postal, telegraphic, and railroad systems all began in 1854- The first grew to such dimensions that by the outbreak of war in 1939 it handled over a billion pieces of mail and forty million rupees in money orders each year. The railroad grew from 200 miles in 1855 to 9,000 in 1880, to 15,000 in 1901, and to 43,000 in 1939. This, the third largest railroad system in the world, carried 600 million passengers and 90 mil- lion tons of freight a year. About the same time, the dirt tracks of 1858 had been partly replaced by over 300,000 miles of highways, of which only about a quarter could be rated as first class. From 1925 onward, these highways were used increasingly by passenger buses, crowded and ramshackle in many cases, but steadily breaking down the isolation of the villages. Improved communications and public order served to merge the iso- lated village markets, smoothing out the earlier alternations of scarcity and glut with their accompanying phenomena of waste and of starvation in the midst of plenty. All this led to a great extension of cultivation into more remote areas and the growing of a greater variety of crops. Sparsely settled areas of forests and hills, especially in Assam and the Northwest Provinces, were occupied, without the devastation of deforestation (as m China or in non-Indian Nepal) because of a highly developed forestry conservation service. .Migration, permanent and seasonal, became rcgul ar features of Indian life, the earnings of the migrants being sent back to their families in the villages they had left. A magnificent system of canals. chiefly for irrigation, was constructed, populating desolate wastes, espe' cially in the northwestern parts of the country, and encouraging whole tribes which had previously been pastoral freebooters to settle down a s cultivators. By 1939 almost 60 million acres of land were irrigated. F° r this and other reasons, the sown area of India increased from 195 t0 228 million acres in about forty years (1900-1939). Increases in yicl* were much less satisfactory because of reluctance to change, lack ot knowledge or capital, and organizational problems. The tax on land traditionally had been the major part of public reve- nue in India, and remained near 50 percent as late as 1900. Under th e Moguls these land revenues had been collected by tax farmers. In many areas, notably Bengal, the British tended to regard these land revenues » s rents rather than taxes, and thus regarded the revenue collectors as the owners of the land.

Numerous legislative enactments sought, without great success, 0 improve these conditions. Such efforts were counterbalanced by the growth of population, the great rise in the value of land, the inability industry or commerce to drain surplus population from the land as st a s it increased, the tendency of the government to favor industry or ornmerce over agriculture by tariffs, taxation, and public expenditures, ! ^ growing frequency of famines (from droughts), of malaria (from ' rr igation projects), and of plague (from trade with the Far East) which P e d out in one year gains made in several years, the growing burden . P eas ant debt at onerous terms and at high interest rates, and the grow- g inability to supplement incomes from cultivation by incomes from sehold crafts because of the growing competition from cheap indus- al goods. Although slavery was abolished in 1843, many of the poor . re reduced to peonage by contracting debts at unfair terms and bind- g themselves and their heirs to work for their creditors until the debt s Paid. Such a debt could never be paid, in many cases, because the e at which it was reduced was left to the creditor and could rarely questioned by the illiterate debtor. ^11 of these misfortunes culminated in the period 1895-1901. There been a long period of declining prices in 1873-1896, which increased °urden on debtors and stagnated economic activities. In 1897 the nsoon rains failed, with a loss of 18 million tons of food crops and one million lives from famine. This disaster was repeated in 1899-1900. onic plague was introduced to Bombay from China in 1895 and killed ut two million persons in the next six years. r °m this low point in 1901, economic conditions improved fairly aa iiy, except for a brief period in 1919-1922 and the long burden of the \"d depression in 1929-1934. The rise in prices in 1900-1914 benefited ia more than others, as the prices of her exports rose more rapidly. e War of 1914-1918 gave India a great economic opportunity, espe- y by increasing the demand for her textiles. Tariffs were raised My after 1916, providing protection for industry, especially in metals, es > cement, and paper. The customs became the largest single source evenue, alleviating to some extent the pressure of taxation on cul- j. or s. However, the agrarian problem remained acute, for most of the ° f s listed above remained in force. In 1931 it was estimated that, in |. United Provinces, 30 percent of the cultivators could not make a \"g from their holdings even in good years, while 52 percent could c a living in good years but not in bad ones. R re was great economic advance in mining, industry, commerce, and |. c e in the period after 1900. Coal output went up from 6 to 21 mil- tons in 1900-1924, and petroleum output (chiefly from Burma) • U P from 37 to 294 million gallons. Production in the protected stales also improved in the same period until, by 1932, India could"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"I58  TRAGEDY AND HOPE produce three-quarters of her cotton cloth, three-quarters of her steel, and most of her cement, matches, and sugar. In one product, jute, India became the chief source for the world's supply, and this became the leading export after 1925. A notable feature of the growth of manufacturing in India after 1900 lies in the fact that Hindu capital largely replaced British capital, chiefly for political reasons. In spite of India's poverty, there was a considerable volume of saving, arising chiefly from the inequitable distribution of income to the landlord class and to the moneylenders (if these two groups can be separated in this way). Naturally, these groups preferred to invest their incomes back in the activities whence they had been derived, but, after 1919, nationalist agitation and especially Gandhi's influence inclined many Hindus to make contributions to their country's strength by i n \" vesting in industry. The growth of industry should not be exaggerated, and its influences were considerably less than one might believe at first glance. There w' aS little growth of an urban proletariat or of a permanent class of factory workers, although this did exist. Increases in output came largely from power production rather than from increases in the labor force. This labor force continued to be rural in its psychological and social orienta- tion, being generally temporary migrants from the villages, living under urban industrial conditions only for a few years, with every intention 01 returning to the village eventually, and generally sending savings back to their families and visiting them for weeks or even months each V eaf (generally at the harvest season). This class of industrial laborers did n ot adopt either an urban or a proletarian point of view, were almost wholl)' illiterate, formed labor organizations only reluctantly (because of re- fusal to pay dues), and rarely acquired industrial skills. After 1915 lab° f unions did appear, but membership remained small, and they were or- ganized and controlled bv nonlaboring persons, frequently middle-cla sS intellectuals. Moreover, industry remained a widely scattered activity found in a few cities but absent from the rest. Although India had 3' cities of over 100,000 population in 1921, most of these remained con 1 ' mercial and administrative centers and not manufacturing centers. Tha the chief emphasis remained on rural activities can be seen from the fa c that these 35 centers of population had a total of 8.2 million inhabitafl compared to 310.7 million outside their limits in 1921. In fact, only 3 million persons lived in the 1,623 centers of over 5,000 persons each, whi 289 million lived in centers smaller than 5,000 persons.  .  One of the chief ways in which the impact of Western culture reache India was by education. The charge has frequently been made that tn British neglected education in India or that they made an error in erf phasizing education in English for the upper classes rather than educati\""},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"THE BUFFER FRINGE  159  tn -e vernacular languages for the masses of the people. History does not stain the justice of these charges. In England itself the government urned little responsibility for education until 1902, and in general had \"lore advanced policy in this field in India than in England until well 0 the present century. Until 1835 the English did try to encourage J ve traditions of education, but their vernacular schools failed from 1 °f patronage; the Indians themselves objected to being excluded, as e y re garded it, from English education. Accordingly, from 1835 the 'sn offered English-language education on the higher levels in the , no Pe that Western science, technology, and political attitudes could . Produced without disrupting religious or social life and that these novations would \"infiltrate\" downward into the population. Because of expense, government-sponsored education had to be restricted to the 5\" e f levels, although encouragement for vernacular schools on the lower els began (without much financial obligation) in 1854. The \"infiltration inward\" theory was quite mistaken because those who acquired owledge of English used it as a passport to advancement in government Ic e or professional life and became renegades from, rather than mis- aries to, the lower classes of Indian society. In a sense the use of 5 Jsh on the university level of education did not lead to its spread in lan society but removed those who acquired it from that society, ln g them in a kind of barren ground which was neither Indian nor s tern but hovered uncomfortably between the two. The fact that Wedge of Engish and possession of a university degree could free rom the physical drudgery of Indian life by opening the door to ] c service or the professions created a veritable passion to obtain se keys (but only in a minority). e British had little choice but to use English as the language of rnment and higher education. In India the languages used in these ^ a ^ been foreign ones for centuries. The language of gov- j Cnt anc * °f ^ e court s was Persian until 1837. Advanced and middle- in A Ucat ' on na d always been foreign, in Sanskrit for the Hindus and H' A 1C ^° r t ' ie Muslims. Sanskrit, a \"dead\" language, was that of u re hgious literature, while Arabic was the language of the Koran, only writing the ordinary iMuslim would wish to read. In fact, the S^nce of the Muslims to the Koran and to Arabic was so intense sy ^ refused to participate in the new English-language educational Ur t , ano '' ' n consequence, had been excluded from government, the ssions, and much of the economic life of the country by 1900. abl ° vernaciHar language could have been used to teach the really valu- a . Con tributions of the West, such as science, technology, economics, Wi ra l science, or political science, because the necessary vocabulary acking in the vernaculars. When the university of the native state of"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"l6o  TRAGEDY AND HOPE Hyderabad tried to translate Western works into Urdu for teaching pur- poses after 1920, it was necessary to create about 40,000 new words. Moreover, the large number of vernacular languages would have made the choice of any one of them for the purpose of higher education in- vidious. And, finally, the natives themselves had no desire to learn to read their vernacular languages, at least during the nineteenth century; they wanted to learn English because it provided access to knowledge, to government positions, and to social advancement as no vernacular could- But it must be remembered that it was the exceptional Indian, not the average one, who wanted to learn to read at all. The average native was content to remain illiterate, at least until deep into the twentieth century- Only then did the desire to read spread under the stimulus of growing nationalism, political awareness, and growing concern with political and religious tensions. These fostered the desire to read, in order to read newspapers, but this had adverse effects: each political or religious group had its own press and presented its own biased version of world events so that, by 1940, these different groups had entirely different ideas of realitv. .Moreover, the new enthusiasm for the vernacular languages, the in- fluence of extreme Hindu nationalists like B. G. Tilak (1859-1920) or anti-Westerners like M. K. Gandhi (1869-1948), led to a wholesale rejec- tion of all that was best in British or in European culture. At the sam £ time, those who sought power, advancement, or knowledge continue\" to learn English as the key to these ambitions. Unfortunately, these semi' westernized Indians neglected much of the practical side of the Europe^ 0 way of life and tended to be intellectualist and doctrinaire and to despi se practical learning and physical labor. They lived, as we have said, in 3 middle world which was neither Indian nor Western, spoiled for the India way of life, but often unable to find a position in Indian society whic would allow them to live their own version of a Western way of iit e : At the university they studied literature, law, and political science, &> subjects which emphasized verbal accomplishments. Since India did no provide sufficient jobs for such accomplishments, there was a great de of \"academic unemployment,\" with resulting discontent and groWi'V radicalism. The career of Gandhi was a result of the efforts of ot ^ man to avoid this problem by fusing certain elements of Western teac ing with a purified Hinduism to create a nationalist Indian way of \" on a basically moral foundation. It is obvious that one of the chief effects of British educational poliw has been to increase the social tensions within India and to give them political orientation. This change is usually called the \"rise of InO\" nationalism,\" but it is considerably more complex than this simple nafl might imply. It began to rise about 1890, possibly under the influence the misfortunes at the end of the century, grew steadily until it reach"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"THE BUFFER FRINGE  161  cr isis stage after 1917, and finally emerged in the long-drawn crisis of '930-1947. n uia s outlook was fundamentally religious, iust as the British outlook fundamentally political. The average Indian derived from his religious °ok a profound conviction that the material world and physical com- were irrelevant and unimportant in contrast with such spiritual mat- s a s the proper preparation for the life to come after the body's death. , 'n his English education the average Indian student derived the con- 10n m at liberty and self-government were the highest goods of life must be sought by such resistance to authority as had been shown in ° iV %na Carta, the opposition to Charles I, the \"Glorious Revolution\" of 9. the writings of John Locke and of John Stuart Mill, and the • era * resistance to public authority found in nineteenth century liberal- and laissez-faire. These two points of view tended to merge in the ds of Indian intellectuals into a point of view in which it seemed ,. .English political ideals should be sought by Indian methods of gious fervor, self-sacrifice, and contempt for material welfare or ysical comforts. As a result, political and social tensions were acerbated Veen British and Indians, between Westernizers and Nationalists, be- en Hindus and Muslims, between Brahmins and lower castes, and ween caste members and outcastes. of • early part of the nineteenth century there had been a revival terest in Indian languages and literatures. This revival soon revealed . rnan ) r Hindu ideas and practices had no real support in the earliest • . enc e. Since these later innovations included some of the most ob- inf '? na features of Hindu life, such as suttee, child marriage, female 'ority, image worship, and extreme polytheism, a movement began sought to free Hinduism from these extraneous elements and to re- e it to its earlier \"purity\" by emphasizing ethics, monotheism, and an ract idea of deity. This tendency was reinforced by the influence of lstla nity and of Islam, so that the revived Hinduism was really a • le sis of these three religions. As a consequence of these influences, ° d, and basic, Hindu idea of Karma was played down. This idea main- tnat each individual soul reappeared again and again, throughout dift \"^' ' n a different physical form and in a different social status, each rence being a reward or punishment for the soul's conduct at its ous appearance.

How could castes be ended if these are God-given gradations for the rewards or punish- ments earned in an earlier existence? How could suttee be ended if ? wife is a wife through all eternity, and must pass from one life to an- other when her husband does? The influence of Christianity and of Islam, of Western ideas and ot British education, in changing Hindu society was largely a consequence of their ability to reduce the average Hindu's faith in Karma. One of die earliest figures in this growing synthesis of Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam was Ram Mohan Roy (1772-1833), founder of the Brahma Sarnaj Society in 1828. Another was Keshab Chandra Sen (1841-1884), who hoped to unite Asia and Europe into a common culture on the basis 01 a synthesis of the common elements of these three religions. The re were many reformers of this type. Their most notable feature was that they were universalist rather than nationalist and were Westernizers i° their basic inclinations. About 1870 a change began to appear, perhap 5 from the influence of Rama Krishna (1834-1886) and his disciple Swam 1 Vivekananda (1862-1902), founder of Vedanta. This new tendency em- phasized India's spiritual power as a higher value than the material power of the West. It advocated simplicity, asceticism, self-sacrific, coopers tion, and India's mission to spread these virtues to the world. One of the disciples of this movement was Gopal Krishna Gokhale (1866-1915)' founder of the Servants of India Society (1905). This was a small band of devoted persons who took vows of poverty and obedience, to regat 1 all Indians as brothers irrespective of caste or creed, and to engage in no personal quarrels. The members scattered among the most diverse group s of India to teach, to weld India into a single spiritual unit, and to see* social reform. In time these movements became increasingly nationalistic and anti- Western, tending to defend orthodox Hinduism rather than to purify J and to oppose Westerners rather than to copv them. This tendency cu' minated in Bal Gangathar Tilak (1859-1920), a Marathi journalist 0 Poona, who started his career in mathematics and law but slowly de- veloped a passionte love for Hinduism, even in its most degrading detail 5 ' and insisted that it must be defended against outsiders, even with violei 1( - e ' He was not opposed to reforms which appeared as spontaneous develop ments of Indian sentiment, but he was violently opposed to any attemp to legislate reform from above or to bring in foreign influences fr° European or Christian sources.

By 1897 ne was using his paper to incite to murder and riots a gainst government officials. A British official who foresaw this movement toward violent nationalism as eai \"ly as 1878 sought to divert it into more legal and more construc- lve channels by establishing the Indian National Congress in 1885. The official in question, Allan Octavian Hume (1829-1912), had the secret u Pport of the viceroy, Lord Dufferin. They hoped to assemble each year an unofficial congress of Indian leaders to discuss Indian political latters in the hope that this experience would provide training in the v orking of representative institutions and parliamentary government. For . Went y years the Congress agitated for extension of Indian participation the administration, and for the extension of representation and even- ally of parliamentary government within the British system. It is notable at this movement renounced violent methods, did not seek separation orn Britain, and aspired to form a government based on the British Pattern. Support for the movement grew very slowly at first, even among •ndus, and there was open opposition, led by Sir Saivid Ahmad Khan, anK) ng the .Muslims. As the movement gathered momentum, after 1890, an y British officials began to oppose it. At the same time, under pressure rr °m Tilak, the Congress itself advanced its demands and began to use \"ornic pressure to obtain these. As a result, after 1900, fewer Muslims ed the Congress: there were 156 Muslims out of 702 delegates in 9°> out only 17 out of 756 in 1905.

The constitutional development of India did not stand still during this tumult. In 1861 appointive councils with advisory powers had been created, both at the center to assist the viceroy and in the provinces. These had nonofficial as well as official members, and the provincial ones had certain legislative powers, but all these activities were under strict executive control and veto. In 1892 these powers were widened to allow discussion of administrative questions, and various nongovernmental groups (called \"communities\") were allowed to suggest individuals fo r the unofficial seats in the councils. A third act, of 1909, passed by the Liberal government with John (Lord) Morley as secretary of state and Lord Minto as viceroy, enlarged the councils, making a nonofficial majority in the provincial councils, al- lowed the councils to vote on all issues, and gave the right to elect the nonofficial members to various communal groups, including Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs, on a fixed ratio. This last provision was a disaster- By establishing separate electoral lists for various religious groups, it en- couraged religious extremism in all groups, made it likely that the nior e extremist candidates would be successful, and made religious differences the basic and irreconcilable fact of political life. By giving religion minorities more seats than their actual proportions of the electorate en- titled them to (a principle known as \"weightage\"), it made it political') advantageous to be a minoritv. By emphasizing minority rights (in whic\" they did believe) over majority rule (in which they did not believe) tM British made religion a permanentlv disruptive force in political life, and encouraged the resulting acerbated extremism to work out its rivalry outside the constitutional framework and the scope of legal action i° riots rather than at the polls or in political assemblies. Moreover, as sooi as the British had given the Muslims this special constitutional position i' 1909 they lost the support of the Muslim community in 1911-1919. TW loss of Muslim support was the result of several factors.

As a result the Muslim Leag u called for self-government for India for the first time in 1913, and f° years later formed an alliance with the Indian National Congress wn' c continued until 1924. In 1909, while Philip Kerr (Lothian), Lionel Curtis, and (Sir) Willi^ Marris were in Canada laving the foundations for the Round Table 0 ganization there, Marris persuaded Curtis that \"self-government, • •"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"THE BUFFER FRINGE  165  owever far distant was the only intelligible goal of British policy in ncIla • • . the existence of political unrest in India, so far from being a re ason for pessimism, was the surest sign that the British, with all their Manifest failings, had not shirked their primary duty of extending west- rn e ducation to India and so preparing Indians to govern themselves.\" our years later the Round Table group in London decided to investi- gate how this could be done. It formed a stud}' group of eight members, ,1 er Curtis, adding to the group three officials from the India Office. \" 1S group decided, in 1915, to issue a public declaration favoring \"the Progressive realization of responsible government in India.\" A declara- '°n to this effect was drawn up by Lord Milner and was issued on ugust 20, 1917, by Secretary of State for India Edwin S. Montagu, said that \"the policy of His Majesty's Government, with which the overnnient of India are in complete accord, is that of the increasing association of Indians in every branch of the administration and the gradual development of self-governing institutions with a view to the Progressive realisation of responsible government in India as an integral Part of the British Empire.\" I his declaration was revolutionary because, for the first time, it spe- cally enunciated British hopes for India's future and because it used, °r the first time, the words \"responsible government.\" The British had Poken vaguely for over a century about \"self-government\" for India; e y had spoken increasingly about \"representative government\"; but thev °- consistently avoided the expression \"responsible government.\" This ter term meant parliamentary government, which most English con- r vatives regarded as quite unsuited for Indian conditions, since it re- l 'red, they believed, an educated electorate and a homogeneous social •/stem, both of which were lacking in India. The conservatives had «ed for years about ultimate self-government for India on some in- genous Indian model, but had done nothing to find such a model. Then, 1 nout any clear conception of where they were going, they had intro- Ce d \"representative government,\" in which the executive consulted with T ' lc opinion through representatives of the people (either appointed, as l °°i, or elected, as in 1909), but with the executive still autocratic and „ n ° Wa V responsible to these representatives. The use of the expression Sponsible government\" in the declaration of 1917 went back to the *°und Table group and ultimately to the Marris-Curtis conversation in j Canadian Rockies in 1909. n the meantime, the Round Table study-group had worked for three \", ar f ('913-1916) on methods for carrying out this promise.

This approach to the problem was named \"dyarchy\" by Curtis. The Round Table draft was sent to the Governor of New South Wales, Lord Chelmsford, a Fellow of All Souls College, who believed that it came from an official committee of the India Office. After he accepted it in principle he was made Viceroy of India in 1916. Cuius went to India immediately to consult with local authorities there (including Meston, Marris, Hailev, and the retired Times Foreign Editor, Sir Valentine Chirol) as well as with Indians. From these conferences emerged a report, written bv Marris, which was issued as the Montagu- Chelmsford Report in 1917. The provisions of this report were drawn up as a bill, passed bv Parliament (after substantial revision by a Joint Com- mittee under Lord Selborne) and became the Government of India Act of 1919. The Act of 1919 was the most important law in Indian constitutional history before 1935. It divided governmental activities into \"central\" and \"provincial.\" The former included defense, foreign affairs, railways and communications, commerce, civil and criminal law and procedures and others; the latter included public order and police, irrigation, forests, edu- cation, public health, public works, and other activities. Furthermore, the provincial activities were divided into \"transferred\" departments and \"reserved\" departments, the former being entrusted to native ministers who were responsible to provincial assemblies. The central government remained in the hands of the governor-general and viceroy, who was responsible to Britain and not to the Indian Legislature. His Cabinet (Executive Council) usually had three Indian members after 1921. The legislature was bicameral, consisting of a Council of State and a Legis- tive Assembly. In both, some members were appointed officials, but the majority were elected on a very restricted suffrage. There were, on the electoral lists, no more than 900,000 voters for the lower chamber and only 1 6,000 for the upper chamber. The provincial unicameral legislatures had a wider, but still limited, franchise, with about a million on the list of voters in Bengal, half as many in Bombay. Moreover, certain seats, on the principle of \"weightage,\" were reserved to Muslims elected by a separate Muslim electoral list. Both legislatures had the power to enact laws, subject to rather extensive powers of veto and of decree in the hands of the governor-general and the appointed provincial governors. Only the \"transferred\" departments of the provincial governments wer e responsible to elective assemblies, the \"reserved\" activities on the pr°' vincial level and all activities in the central administration being respon- sible to the appointed governors and governor-general and ultimately t0 Britain. It was hoped that the Act of 1919 would provide opportunities i n parliamentarv procedures, responsible government, and administration to Indians so that self-government could be extended by successive step 5"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"THE BUFFER FRINGE  167  ater , but these hopes were destroyed in the disasters of 1919-1922. The violence of British reactionaries collided with the nonviolent refusal to ^ooperate of Mahatma Gandhi, crushing out the hopes of the Round able reformers between them. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (1869-1948), known as \"Mahatma,\" F Great Soul,\" was the son and grandson of prime ministers of a \"unute princely state in western India. Of the Vaisya caste (third of the ° Ur )> he grew up in a very religious and ascetic atmosphere of Hinduism. .Married at thirteen and a father at fifteen, Gandhi was sent 0 England to study law by his older brother when he was seventeen. en a voyage was forbidden bv the rules of his caste, and he was spelled from it for going. Before he left he gave a vow to his family ot to touch wine, women, or meat. After three years in England he P ssed the bar at Inner Temple. .Most of his time in Europe was passed dilettante fads, experimenting with vegetarian diets and self-adminis- f ed medicines or in religious or ethical discussions with English faddists mdiophiles. He was much troubled by religious scruples and feelings guilt. Back in India in 1891, he was a failure as a lawyer because of inarticulate lack of assurance and his real lack of interest in the law. ™ l8 93 a Muslim firm sent him to Natal, South Africa, on a case. There ^dhi found his vocation. ne population of Natal in 1896 consisted of 50,000 Europeans, mostly gish, 400,000 African natives, and 51,000 Indians, chiefly outcastes. e ast group had been imported from India, chiefly as indentured work- °n three or five-year contracts, to work the humid lowland plan- °ns where the Negroes refused to work. Most of the Indians stayed, r their contracts were fulfilled, and were so industrious and intelli- o' • t ' le ^ De g an to r ' se very rapidly in an economic sense, espe- y in the retail trades. The whites, who were often indolent, resented competition from dark-skinned persons and were generally indig- _ at Indian economic success. As Lionel Curtis told Gandhi in the nsvaal in 1903, \"It is not the vices of Indians that Europeans in this ountry fea r but their virtues.\" ne n Gandhi first arrived in Natal in 1893, he found that that country, most of South Africa, was rent with color hatred and group ani- lilo ies. All political rights were in the hands of whites, while the c • . lltes were subjected to various kinds of social and economic dis- iud linatlons an d segregations. When Gandhi first appeared in court, the G A or dered him to remove his turban (worn with European clothes); W , U usec ^ anc l left.

For the rest of his life lie"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"l68  TRAGEDY AND HOPE traveled only third class. In the Transvaal he was unable to get a room in a hotel because of his color. These episodes gave him his new vocation: to establish that Indians were citizens of the British Empire and there- fore entitled to equality under its laws. He was determined to use only peaceful methods of passive mass noncooperation to achieve his goal. His chief weapon would be love and submissiveness, even to those who treated him most brutally. His refusal to fear death or to avoid pain and his efforts to return love to those who tried to inflict injuries upon him made a powerful weapon, especially if it were practiced on a mass basis. Gandhi's methods were reallv derived from his own Hindu tradition, but certain elements in this tradition had been reinforced by reading Ruskin, Thoreau, Tolstoi, and the Sermon on the Mount. When he was brutally beaten bv whites in Natal in 1897, he refused to prosecute, saying that it was not their fault that they had been taught evil ideas. These methods gave the Indians of South Africa a temporary respite from the burden of intolerance under Gandhi's leadership in the period 1893-1914. When the Transvaal proposed an ordinance compelling all Indians to register, be fingerprinted, and carry identity cards at all times, Gandhi organized a mass, peaceful refusal to register. Hundreds went to jail. Smuts worked out a compromise with Gandhi: if the Indians would register \"voluntarily\" the Transvaal would repeal the ordinance. After Gandhi had persuaded his compatriots to register, Smuts failed to carry out his part of the agreement, and the Indians solemnly burned their registration cards at a mass meeting. Then, to test the Transvaal ban on Indian immigration, Gandhi organized mass marches of Indians into the Transvaal from Natal. Others went from the Transvaal to Natal and re- turned, being arrested for crossing the frontier. At one time 2,500 of the 13,000 Indians in the Transvaal were in jail and 6,000 were in exile. The struggle was intensified after the creation of the Union of South Africa in 1910 because the Transvaal restrictions on Indians, which for- bade them to own land, to live outside segregated districts, or to vote, were not repealed, and a Supreme Court decision of 1913 declared all non-Christian marriages to be legally invalid. This last decision deprived most nonwhite wives and children of all legal protection of their famib rights. Mass civil disobedience by Indians increased, including a march by 6,000 from Natal to the Transvaal. Finally, after much controversy, Gandhi and Smuts worked out an elaborate compromise agreement i' 1 1914. This revoked some of the discriminations against Indians in Soutn Africa, recognized Indian marriages, annulled a discriminatory £ 3 annua tax on Indians, and stopped all importation of indentured labor from In* a in 1920. Peace was restored in this civil controversy just in time w permit a united front in the external war with Germany. But in Sout Africa by 1914 Gandhi had worked out the techniques he would us against the British in India after 1919."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"THE BUFFER FRINGE  169  Until 1919 Gandhi was very loyal to the British connection. Both in °uth Africa and in India he had found that the English from England Were much more tolerant and understanding than most of the English- leaking whites of middle-cl ass origin in the overseas areas. In the Boer ar he was the active leader of an 1,100-man Indian ambulance corps lcn worked with inspiring courage even under fire on the field of at tle. During World War I, he worked constantly on recruiting cam- P ai gns for the British forces.

We should suffer to the most of our ability and even lay down our lives to defend the Empire, he Empire perishes, with it perishes our cherished aspiration.\" uring this period Gandhi's asceticism and his opposition to all kinds discrimination were winning him an outstanding moral position among e Indian people. He was opposed to all violence and bloodshed, to °hol, meat, and tobacco, even to the eating of milk and eggs, and to ; (even in marriage). More than this, he was opposed to Western indus- a usm, to Western science and medicine, and to the use of Western \"er than Indian languages. He demanded that his followers make fixed \" °tas of homespun cotton each day, wore a minimum of homespun otrung himself, spun on a small wheel throughout all his daily activities, took the small hand spinning wheel as the symbol of his movement— this in order to signify the honorable nature of handwork, the need Indian economic self-sufficiency, and his opposition to Western in- \"p tri f ^ e W0I \"ked for equality for the untouchables, calling them od s children\" (Harijans), associating with them whenever he could, n g them into his own home, even adopting one as his own daughter. 1 Worked to relieve economic oppression, organizing strikes against .

You cannot fast against a tyrant.\" Gandhi never seemed to recog- nize that his fasting and nonviolent civil disobedience were effective against the British in India and in South Africa only to the degree that the British had the qualities of humanity, decency, generosity, and fair play which he most admired, but that by attacking the British through these virtues he was weakening Britain and the class which possessed these virtues and making it more likely that they would be replaced by nations and by leaders who did not have these virtues. Certainly Hitler and the Germans who exterminated six million Jews in cold bood during World War II would not have shared the reluctance of Smuts to im- prison a few thousand Indians or Lord Halifax's reluctance to see Gandhi starve himself to death. This was the fatal weakness of Gandhi's aims and his methods, but these aims and methods were so dear to Indian hearts and so selflessly pursued by Gandhi that he rapidly became the spiritual leader of the Indian National Congress after Gokhale's death in 1915- In this position Gandhi by his spiritual power succeeded in something which no earlier Indian leader had achieved and few had hoped for: he spread political awareness and nationalist feeling from the educated class down into the great uneducated mass of the Indian people. This mass and Gandhi expected and demanded a greater degree of self- government after the end of World War I. The Act of 1919 provided that, and probably provided as much of it as the political experience of Indians entitled them to. Moreover, the Act anticipated expansion of the areas of self-government as Indian political experience increased. But the Act was largely a failure, because Gandhi had aroused political am- bitions in great masses of Indians who lacked experience in political activities, and these demands gave rise to intense opposition to Indian self-government in British circles which did not share the ideals of the Round Table group. Finally, the actions of this British opposition drove Gandhi from \"nonresistance\" through complete \"noncooperation,\" t0 \"civil disobedience,\" thus destroying the whole purpose of the Act 01 1919. Many British conservatives both at home and in India opposed the Act of 1919. Lord Ampthill, who had long experience in India and had valiantly supported Gandhi in South Africa, attacked the Act and Lionel Curtis for making it. In the House of Lords he said: \"The in- credible fact is that, but for the chance visit to India of a globe-trotting •  * 1 doctrinaire with a positive mania for constitution-mongering [Curtis]' nobody in the world would ever have thought of so peculiar a notion & Dyarchy.

Moreover, this self-paying manpower pool was beyond the scrutiny the British reformer as well as the British taxpayer. The older Tories, * tn tn eir strong army connections, and others, like Winston Churchill, rth an appreciation of military matters, did not see how England could Ce the military demands of the twentieth century without Indian mili- r y manpower, at least in colonial areas. instead of getting more freedom at the end of the war in 1918, the \"lans got less. The conservative group pushed through the Rowlatt Act IK arcn I0I 9- This continued most of the wartime restrictions on civil erties in India, to be used to control nationalist agitations. Gandhi called civil disobedience and a series of scattered local general strikes rtels) Jn protest. These actions led to violence, especially to Indian ac ks on the British.

At this point Gandhi committed a grave error of judgment. In order to solidify the alliance of Hindu and Muslim which had been in existence since 1917, he supported the Khilafat movement of Indian Muslims to obtain a lenient peace treaty for the Turkish sultan (and caliph) follow- ing World War I. Gandhi suggested that the Khilafat adopt \"noncoop- eration\" against Britain to enforce its demands. This would have in- volved a boycott of British goods, schools, law courts, offices, honors, and of all goods subject to British taxes (such as alcohol). This was an error of judgment because the sultan was soon overthrown by his own people organized in a Turkish Nationalist movement and seeking a secu- larized Turkish state, in spite of all Britain was already doing (both in public and in private) to support him. Thus, the Khilafat movement was seeking to force Britain to do something it already wanted to do and was not able to do. Moreover, by bringing up \"noncooperation\" as a weapon against the British, Gandhi had opened a number of doors he had no desire to open, with very bad consequences for India. At the Indian National Congress of December, 1919, Tilak and Gandhi were the leading figures. Both were willing to accept the Montagu- Chelmsford Reforms, Tilak because he believed this would be the best way to prove that they were not adequate. But on August 1, 192°' Gandhi proclaimed \"noncooperation\" in behalf of the Khilafat movement. On the same day Tilak died, leaving Gandhi as undisputed leader of the Congress. At the 1920 meeting he won unanimous approval for \"non- cooperation,\" and then moved a resolution for siaaraj (self-rule) either within or outside the British Empire. The Muslims in Congress, led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, refused to accept an independent India outside the British Empire because this would subject the Muslims to a Hindu majority without Britain's protecting restraint. As a result, from that point, many Muslims left the Congress. Noncooperation was a great public success. But it did not get self-m' e for India, and made the country less fitted for self-rule by making lC impossible for Indians to get experience in government under the Act of 1919. Thousands of Indians gave up medals and honors, gave up tn e practice of law in British courts, left the British schools, and burned British goods. Gandhi held great mass meetings at which thousands ° persons stripped themselves of their foreign clothing to throw it on rag' ing bonfires.

And finally the boycott had crippled the ontagu-Chelmsford Reforms, almost two-thirds of the eligible voters Slr >g to vote in the Councils elections of November, 1920. IRELAND TO 1939 hue the Indian crisis was at its height in 1919-1922, an even more ent crisis was raging in Ireland. Throughout the nineteenth century n °- na d been agitated by grievances of long standing. The three major terns were agrarian, religious, and political. The Cromwellian con- I A \"eland in the seventeenth century had transferred much Irish > as plunder of war, to absentee English landlords. In consequence . rents > insecure tenure, lack of improvements, and legalized economic F oitation, supported by English judges and English soldiers, gave rise ent agrarian unrest and rural atrocities against English lives and w ° lntlln g with Gladstone's Land Act of 1870, the agrarian problems Dr Ki v alleviated and, by 1914, were well in hand.

The Liberal government of 1906-1916 tried to enact a Home Rule bill with continued Irish representation in the House of Commons, but was repeatedly blocked by the opposition of the House of Lords; the bill did not become law until September, 1914. The chief opposition arose from the fact that Protestant Ulster (Northern Ireland) would be submerged in an overwhelmingly Catholic Ireland. The Ulster opposition, led by Sir Edward (later Lord) Carson. organized a private army, armed it with guns smuggled from Germany, and prepared to seize control of Belfast at a signal from London. Carson was on his way to the telegraph station to send this signal in 1914 when he received a message from the prime minister that war was about to break out with Germany. Accordingly, the Ulster revolt was canceled and the Home Rule Act was suspended until six months after the peace with Germany. As a consequence the revolt with German arms in Ire- land was made by the Irish Nationalists in 1916, instead of by their Ulster opponents in 1914. This so-called Easter Revolt of 1916 v' aS crushed and its leaders executed, but discontent continued to simmer in Ireland, with violence only slightly below the surface. In the parliamentary election of 1918, Ireland elected 6 Nationalist (who wanted Home Rule for all Ireland), 73 Sinn Fein (who wanted an Irish Republic free from England), and 23 Unionists (who wanted to remain part of Britain). Instead of going to Westminster, the Si' 111 Fein organized their own Parliament in Dublin. Efforts to arrest i tS members led to open civil war.

This was enacted into law eight months later as tn Government of Ireland Act of 1920, but was rejected by the Iris Republicans led by Eamon de Valera.

One of the chief leaders of the Irish Republicans was Erskine Childers, an old schoolboy friend of Curtis who had been with him in South iVfrica, but nothing could be done through him, since he had become fanatically anti-British. Accordingly, mut s was called in. He wrote a conciliatory speech for King George 0 deliver at the opening of the Ulster Parliament, and made a secret VlS) t to the rebel hiding place in Ireland to try to persuade the Irish Re- publican leaders to be reasonable. He contrasted the insecurity of the r ansvaal Republic before 1895 with its happy condition under domin- on sta tus since 1910, saying: \"Make no mistake about it, you have more privilege, more power, more peace, more security in such a sisterhood ec iual nations than in a small, nervous republic having all the time t0 rely on the good will and perhaps the assistance of foreigners.

This delay arose from the fact that European pressure on India was applied fairly steadily from the early sixteenth century, while in the Far East, in Japan even more completely than in China, this pressure was relaxed from the early seventeenth century for almost two hundred years, to 1794 in the case of China and to 1854 in the case of Japan.

It is customary, in studying this subject, t0 divide this hierarchy into three levels. Politically, these three levels con' sisted of the imperial authority at the top, an enormous hierarchy ° r imperial and provincial officials in the middle, and the myriad of semi' patriarchal, semidemocratic local villages at the bottom. Socially, this hierarchy was similarly divided into the ruling class, the gentry, and the peasants. And, economically, there was a parallel division, the upp er ' most group deriving its incomes as tribute and taxes from its possession of military and political power, while the middle group derived & incomes from economic sources, as interest on loans, rents from lands- and the profits of commercial enterprise, as well as from the salaried graft, and other emoluments arising from his middle group's control 01 the bureaucracy. At the bottom the peasantry, which was the only realty productive group in the society, derived its incomes from the sweat 0 its collective brows, and had to survive on what was left to it after 3 substantial fraction of its product had s[one to the two higher groups 1° the form of rents, taxes, interest, customary bribes (called \"squeeze h and excessive profits on such purchased \"necessities\" of life as salt, iro 11 ' or opium.

Each group knew 1 s established relationships with the others, and used those relationships 0 avoid any sudden or excessive pressures which might disrupt the established patterns of the society. The political and military force of le imperial regime rarely impinged directly on the peasantry, since tie bureaucracy intervened between them as a protecting buifer. This utter followed a pattern of deliberate amorphous inefficiency so that the military and political force from above had been diffused, dispersed, an d blunted by the time it reached down to the peasant villages. The Weaucracy followed this pattern because it recognized that the peas- ntr y Was the source of its incomes, and it had no desire to create such dis- sent as would jeopardize the productive process or the payments of ^ts, taxes, and interest on which it lived. Furthermore, the inefficiency the system was both customary and deliberate, since it allowed a ar ge portion of the wealth which was being drained from the peasantry 0 he diverted and diffused among the middle class of gentry before the mnants of it reached the imperial group at the top. A his imperial group, in its turn, had to accept this system of ineffi- Clen cy and diversion of incomes and its own basic remoteness from the peasantry because of the great size of China, the ineffectiveness of its / ems of transportation and communications, and the impossibility of epmg recor( j s 0 £ population, or of incomes and taxes except through indirect mediation of the bureaucracy. The semiautonomous position , tne bureaucracy depended, to a considerable extent, on the fact the Chinese system of writing was so cumbersome, so inefficient, \" so difficult to learn that the central government could not possibly e kept any records or have administered tax collection, public order, justice except through a bureaucracy of trained experts. This bu- cracy was recruited from the gentry because the complex systems Anting, of law, and of administrative traditions could be mastered ' by a group possessing leisure based on unearned incomes. To be , ' ln time, the training for this bureaucracy and for the examinations • lttln g to it became quite unrealistic, consisting largely of memoriz- 5 or ancient literary texts for examination purposes rather than for any r al or administrative ends.

The im- perial power itself had little desire for any increased efficiency in i ts bureaucracy, since this might have led to increased independence on the part of the bureaucracv. So long as the imperial superstructure of Chi- nese society obtained its share of the wealth flowing upward from the peasantry, it was satisfied. The share of this wealth which the imperial group obtained was very large, in absolute figures, although proportion- ately it was only a small part of the total amount which left the peasant class, the larger part being diverted by the gentry and bureaucracy on its' upward flow. The exploitative nature of this three-class social system was alleviated) as we have seen, by inefficiency, by traditional moderation and accepted ethical ideas, by a sense of social interdependence, and by the power 01 traditional law and custom which protected the ordinary peasant from ar- bitrary treatment or the direct impact of force.

The way ^ s open to the top in Chinese society, not for any individual peasant in hi s own lifetime, but to any individual peasant family over a period °' several generations.

'•i these higher levels of the social structure many families were able to Maintain a position for generations, but in general there was a steady, if s ow , \"circulation of the elite,\" most families remaining in a high social Position for only a couple of generations, after about three generations °' climb, to be followed by a couple of generations of decline. Thus, the 0 American saying that it took only three generations \"from shirt- eeves to shirtsleeves\" would, in the old China, have to be extended to °w about six or seven generations from the rice paddy's drudgery ack to the rice paddy again. But the hope of such a rise contributed u ch to increase individual diligence and family solidarity and to re- Uc e peasant discontent. Only in the late nineteenth and early twentieth ntury did peasants in China come to regard their positions as so hope- ss that violence became preferable to diligence or conformity. This an ge arose from the fact, as we shall see, that the impact of Western cure on China did, in fact, make the peasant's position economically n traditional Chinese society the bureaucrats recruited through ex- 'nations from the gentry class were called mandarins.

The society of the West which began to impinge on China about 1800 was powerful, efficient, and progressive. It had no respect for the corruption, the traditions, the property rights, the family solidarity, or the ethical moderation of traditional Chinese society. As the weapons of the West, along with its efficient methods of sanitation, of writing, of transportation and communications, of individual self-interest, and of corrosive intellectual rationalism came into contact with Chinese society> they began to dissolve it. On the one hand, Chinese society was too weak to defend itself against the West. When it tried to do so, as in the Opium Wars and other struggles of 1841-1861, or in the Boxer up- rising of 1900, such Chinese resistance to European penetration was crushed by the armaments of the Western Powers, and all kinds of con- cessions to these Powers were imposed on China. Until 1841 Canton was the only port allowed for foreign imports, and opium was illegal. As a consequence of Chinese destruction of illegal Indian opium and the commercial exactions of Cantonese authorities, Britain imposed on China the treaties of Nanking (1842) and of Tient- sin (1858). These forced China to cede Hong Kong to Britain and t° open sixteen ports to foreign trade, to impose a uniform import tarin of no more than 5 percent, to pay an indemnity of about $100 milh° n ' to permit foreign legations in Peking, to allow a British official to act as head of the Chinese customs service, and to legalize the import 01 opium. Other agreements were imposed by which China lost various fringe areas such as Burma (to Britain), Indochina (to France), For- mosa and the Pescadores (to Japan), and Macao (to Portugal), while other areas were taken on leases of various durations, from twenty-n v ' e to ninety-nine years. In this way Germany took Kiaochow, Russia took southern Liaotung (including Port Arthur), France took Kwangch 0 ' wan, and Britain took Kowloon and Weihaiwei. In this same perio various Powers imposed on China a system of extraterritorial courts under which foreigners, in judicial cases, could not be tried in Chinese courts or under Chinese law. The political impact of Western civilization on China, great as J was, was overshadowed by the economic impact. We have already i 11 \" * cated that China was a largely agrarian country. Years of cultivate and the slow growth of population had given rise to a relentless pressur on the soil and to a destructive exploitation of its vegetative resource' Most of the country was deforested, resulting in shortage of fuel, rap 1 runoff of precipitation, constant danger of floods, and large- scale erosio' 1 of the soil. Cultivation had been extended to remote valleys and up t\" 1 slopes of hills by population pressures, with a great increase in r1 same destructive consequences, in spite of the fact that many slop e-"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"THE BUFFER FRINGE  l8l  re rebuilt in terraces. The fact that the southern portion of the coun- ) depended on rice cultivation created many problems, since this °Pi of relatively low nutritive value, required great expenditure of , ° r (transplanting and weeding) under conditions which were destruc- 0r good health. Long periods of wading in rice paddies exposed . st peasants to various kinds of joint diseases, and to water-borne Actions such as malaria or parasitical flukes. he pressure on the soil was intensified by the fact that 60 percent of ina \\ vas over (5 000 f eet a bove sea level, too high for cultivation, »e more than half the land had inadequate rainfall (below twenty es a year). Moreover, the rainfall was provided by the erratic mon- n winds which frequently brought floods and occasionally failed P'etely, causing wholesale famine. In the United States 140 million P e were supported by the labor of 6.5 million farmers on 365 million s of cultivated land in 1945; China, about the same time, had almost million persons supported by the labor of 65 million farmers on y 2r 7 million acres of cultivated land. In China the average farm was ' a little over four acres (compared to 157 in the United States) but divided into five or six separate fields and had, on the average, 6.2 or »s living on it (compared to 4.2 persons on the immensely larger e ncan farm). As a result, in China there was only about half an °r land for each person living on the land, compared to the Ameri- gure of 15.7 acres per person. a consequence of this pressure on the land, the average Chinese es nt even * n ear li er times, no margin above the subsistence level, A 1 7 when we recall that a certain part of his income flowed up- ^ to the upper classes. Since, on his agricultural account alone, the va \" ^ C ' nese peasant was below the subsistence level, he had to use n r , s ln g e nious devices to get up to that level. All purchases of goods ced off the farm were kept at an absolute minimum. Every wisp . 5 ass, fallen leaf, or crop residue was collected to serve as fuel. All coll n Waste products, including those of the cities, were carefully ] a , ea - an d restored to the soil as fertilizer. For this reason, farm- a round cities, because of the greater supply of such wastes, were ] 0 , P r °ductive than more remote farms which were dependent on De u Pphes of such human wastes.

In a somewhat similar way the rice paddy was able to contribute to t» e farmer's supply of proteins by acting as a fishpond and an aquarium for minute freshwater shrimp. In China, as in Europe, the aims of agricultural efficiency were quite different from the aims of agricultural efficiency in new countries, such as the United States, Canada, Argentina, or Australia. In these newer countries there was a shortage of labor and a surplus of land, while u 1 Europe and Asia there was a shortage of land and a surplus of labor- Accordingly, the aim of agricultural efficiency in newer lands ^ aS high output of crops per unit of labor. It was for this reason tna American agriculture put such emphasis on labor-saving agriculture machinery and soil-exhausting agricultural practices, while Asiatic agr 1 ' culture put immense amounts of hand labor on small amounts of l» n in order to save the soil and to win the maximum crop from the limite amount of land. In America the farmer could afford to spend larg sums for farm machinery because the labor such machinery replace would have been expensive anyway and because the cost of that m ;1 ' chinery was spread over such a large acreage that its cost per acre w> relatively moderate. In Asia there was no capital for such expenditure on machinery because there was no margin of surplus above subsistcn c in the hands of the peasantry and because the average farm was so small that the cost of machinery per acre (either to buy or even operate) would have been prohibitive. The only surplus in Asia was of labor, and every effort was made, D ; putting more and more labor on the land, to make the limited amou of land more productive. One result of this investment of labor in l a in China can be seen in the fact that about half of the Chinese f ar ^ acreage was irrigated while about a quarter of it was terraced. Anow result of this excess concentration of labor on land was that such l aD was underemployed and semi-idle for about three-quarters of the y e V being fully busy only in the planting and harvest seasons. From ^ semi-idleness of the Asiatic rural population came the most import effort to supplement peasant incomes through rural handicrafts. Bei° we turn to this crucial point, we should glance at the relative succe of China's efforts to achieve high-unit yields in agriculture. In the United States, about 1940, each acre of wheat required '• man-days of work each year; in China an acre of wheat took 26 o 1 * days of labor. The rewards of such expenditures of labor were I 1 \" . different. In China the output of grain for each man-year of labor w 3,080 pounds; in the United States the output was 44,000 pounds p man-year of labor.

The birthrate was kept up, in traditional Chinese society as a conse- quence of a group of ideas which are usually known as \"ancestor wor- ship.\" Every Chinese family had, as its most powerful motivation, the conviction that the family line must be continued in order to have descendants to keep up the family shrines, to maintain the ancestra 1 graves, and to support the living members of the family after their productive years had ended. The expense of such shrines, graves, and old persons was a considerable burden on the average Chinese family and a cumulative burden as well, since the diligence of earlier generations frequently left a family with shrines and graves so elaborate that upke e P alone was a heavy expense to later generations. At the same time the urge to have sons kept the birth rate up and led to such undesirable social practices, in traditional Chinese society, as infanticide, abandon- ment, or sale of female offspring. Another consequence of these idea 5 was that more well-to-do families in China tended to have more childr e[1 than poor families. This was the exact opposite of the situation i ft Western civilization, where a rise in the economic scale resulted in tnC acquisition of a middle-class outlook which included restriction of tW family's offspring. The pressure of China's population on the level of subsistence V® relieved to some extent by wholesale Chinese emigration in the peri |H after 1800. This outward movement was toward the less settled areas ° Manchuria, Mongolia, and southwestern China, overseas to x^merica an Europe, and, above all, to the tropical areas of southeastern Asia ( eS \" pecially to Malaya and Indonesia). In these areas, the diligence, > { gality, and shrewdness of the Chinese provided them with a good livi 1 * and in some cases with considerable wealth. They generally acted as commercial middle class pushing inward between the native Malaysia\" or Indonesian peasants and the upper group of ruling whites. This m° v , ment, which began centuries ago, steadily accelerated after 1900 a gave rise to unfavorable reactions from the non-Chinese residents .  .  to  these areas. The Malav, Siamese, and Indonesians, for example, came regard the Chinese as economically oppressive and exploitative, wS the white rulers of these areas, especially in Australia and New Zealand regarded them with suspicion for political and racial reasons.

It would, perhaps, not be any a exa ggeration to say that peasant handicrafts were the factor which Prnutted the traditional form of society to continue, not only in na but in all of Asia. This society was based on an inefficient agri- tural system in which the political, military, legal, and economic Wis of the upper classes drained from the peasantry such a large pro- r J on of their agricultural produce that the peasant was kept pressed vn to the subsistence level (and, in much of China, below this level). > r by this process could Asia support its large urban populations and ar ge numbers of rulers, soldiers, bureaucrats, traders, priests, and °Iars (none of whom produced the food, clothing, or shelter they e consuming). In all Asiatic countries the peasants on the land were ^\"employed * n agricultural activities, because of the seasonal nature ,. eir work. In the course of time there had grown up a solution to s °cial-agrarian problem: in their spare time the peasantry occupied selves with handicrafts and other nonagricultural activities and then the products of their labor to the cities for money to be used to X nec essities. In real terms this meant that the agricultural products were flowing from the peasantry to the upper classes (and gen- 7 from rural areas to the cities) were replaced in part by handi- s > leaving a somewhat larger share of the peasants' agricultural • cts in the hands of peasants. It was this arrangement which made F ssible for the Chinese peasantry to raise their incomes up to the sub- Slste *ce level. e importance of this relationship should be obvious. If it were . ^yed, the peasant would be faced with a cruel alternative: either he perish by falling below the subsistence level or he could turn to hi n °? * n or< ^ er t( > reduce the claims which the upper classes had on ' gticultural products. In the long run every peasant group was n toward the second of these alternatives. As a result, all Asia by ^ Was in the grip of a profound political and social upheaval because, h„j era tion earlier the demand for the products of peasants' handicrafts ha ^en reduced.  *  P  . e destruction of this delicately balanced system occurred when bit A I y iacn i ne_ma de products of Western manufacture began to flow Pan at * c countries. Native products such as textiles, metal goods, 'n&I ' Wooc * carvings, pottery, hats, baskets, and such found it increas- t u / ai fficult to compete with Western manufactures in the markets of to kvT Vn CIt ^ es - As a result, the peasantry found it increasingly difficult 1 the legal and economic claims which the upper, urban, classes"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"I86  TRAGEDY AND HOPE held against them from agricultural products to handicraft products. And, as a consequence of this, the percentage of their agricultural products which was being taken from the peasantry by the claims of other classes began to rise. This destruction of the local market for native handicrafts could have been prevented if high customs duties had been imposed on European industrial goods. But one point on which the European Powers were agreed was that they would not allow \"backward\" countries to exclude their products with tariffs. In India, Indonesia, and some of the lesser states of southeastern Asia this was prevented by the European Powers taking over the government of the areas; in China, Egypt, Turkey, Pe f \" sia, and some Malay states the European Powers took over no more than the financial system or the customs service. As a result, countries like China, Japan, and Turkey had to sign treaties maintaining their tariffs at 5 or 8 percent and allowing Europeans to control these services. Sir Robert Hart was head of the Chinese customs from 1863 to i9°°> just as Sir Evelyn Baring (Lord Cromer) was head of the Egypti* 111 financial system from 1879 to 1907, and Sir Edgar Vincent (Lord D'Abernon) was the chief figure in the Turkish financial system fr onl 1882 to 1897. As a consequence of the factors we have described, the position 01 the Chinese peasant was desperate by 1900, and became steadily worse- A moderate estimate (published in 1940) showed that 10 percent of t\" e farm population owned 53 percent of the cultivated land, while the other 90 percent had only 47 percent of the land. The majority °' Chinese farmers had to rent at least some land, for which they paid, 3 s rent, from one-third to one-half of the crop. Since their incomes v\" ere not adequate, more than half of all Chinese farmers had to borrow each year. On borrowed grain the interest rate was 85 percent a year; °° money loans the interest rate was variable, being over 20 percent a y ear on nine-tenths of all loans made and over 50 percent a year on one-eight 11 of the loans made. Under such conditions of landownership, rental rates, and interest charges, the future was hopeless for the majority of Chi' iese farmers long before 1940. Yet the social revolution in China did not coifl e until after 1940. The slow growth of the social revolution in China was the result 0 many influences. Chinese population pressure was relieved to some ex- tent in the last half of the nineteenth century by the famines of 1877\" 1879 (which killed about 12 million people), by the political disturb' ances of the Tai-Ping and other rebellions in 1848-1875 (which dc populated large areas), and by the continued hi<jh death rate. The cofl' tinued influence of traditional ideas, especially Confucianism and respe c for ancestral ways, held the lid on this boiling pot until this influen c was destroyed in the period after 1900. Hope that some solution mig' 1"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"THE BUFFER FRINGE  187  e round by the republican regime after the collapse of the imperial regime in i 0 n had a similar effect. And, lastly, the distribution of Ur opean weapons in Chinese society was such as to hinder rather than 0 assist revolution until well into the twentieth century. Then this stribution turned in a direction quite different from that in Western lv uization. These last three points are sufficiently important to warrant a closer examination. We have already mentioned that effective weapons which are difficult Use or expensive to obtain encourage the development of authoritarian gmies in any society. In the late medieval period, in Asia, cavalry P ovided such a weapon. Since the most effective cavalry was that of e pastoral Ural-Altaic-speaking peoples of central Asia, these peoples re able to conquer the peasant peoples of Russia, of Anatolia, of dl a, and of China. In the course of time, the alien regimes of three these areas (not in Russia) were able to strengthen their authority by e acquisition of effective, and expensive, artillery. In Russia, the P \"ices of Moscow, having been the agents of the Mongols, replaced ern by becoming their imitators, and made the same transition to a Wcenary army, based on cavalry and artillery, as the backbone of the In g despotism. In Western civilization similar despotisms, but based mfantry and artillery, were controlled by figures like Louis XIV, e uerick the Great, or Gustavus Adolphus. In Western Civilization, *ever, the Agricultural Revolution after 1725 raised standards of liv- 51 while the Industrial Revolution after 1800 so lowered the cost of arnis that the ordinary citizen of western Europe and of North erica could acquire the most effective weapon existing (the musket). a result of this, and other factors, democracy came to these areas, § with mass armies of citizen-soldiers. In central and southern Eu- P e where the Agricultural and Industrial revolutions came late or at all, the victory of democracy was also late and incomplete. . generally, the revolution in weapons (meaning muskets and later s ) came before the Agricultural Revolution or the Industrial Revo- n - Indeed, most firearms were not locally made, but were imported ' being imported, came into the possession of the upper class of rulers, aucrats, and landlords and not into the hands of peasants or city , . eS- As a result, these ruling groups were generally able to maintain Position against their own masses even when they could not de- themselves against European Powers. As a consequence of this, any °f partial reform or of a successful revolution early enough to be °aerate revolution became quite unlikely.

In India, Malaya, and Indonesia the disarmed native peoples offered no threat of revolt to the ruling European Powers before 1940. In Japan the army, as we shall see, re- mained loyal to the regime and was able to dominate events so that no revolution was conceivable before 1940. But in China the trend of events was much more complex. In China the people could not get weapons because of their low standards of living and the high cost of imported arms. As a result, power remained in the hands of the army, except for small groups who were financed by emigrant Chinese with relatively high incomes over- seas. By 1911 the prestige of the imperial regime had fallen so low that it obtained support from almost no one, and the army refused to sustain it. As a result, the revolutionaries, supported by overseas money, were able to overthrow the imperial regime in an almost bloodless revolution, but were not able to control the army after they had technically come to power. The army, leaving the politicians to squabble over forms of government or areas of jurisdiction, became independent political pow- ers loyal to their own chiefs (\"warlords\"), and supported themselves and maintained their supply of imported arms by exploiting the peas- antry of the provinces. The result was a period of \"warlordism\" from 1920 to 1941. In this period the Republican government was in nominal control 01 the whole country but was actually in control only of the seacoast and river valleys, chiefly in the south, while various warlords, operating as bandits, were in control of the interior and most of the north. In order to restore its control to the whole country, the Republican regime needed money and imported arms. Accordingly, it tried two expedients in se- quence. The first expedient, in the period 1920-1927, sought to restore its power in China by obtaining financial and military support from foreig 11 countries (Western countries, Japan, or Soviet Russia). This expedient failed, either because these foreign Powers were unwilling to assist or ( in the case of Japan and Soviet Russia) were willing to help only on terms which would have ended China's independent political status. As a consc quence, after 1927, the Republican regime underwent a profound change- shifting from a democratic to an authoritarian organization, changing ltS name from Republican to Nationalist, and seeking the money and arms ^° restore its control over the country by making an alliance with the land' lord, commercial, and banking classes of the eastern Chinese cities.

They had acquired Western ideas which were completely incompatible with the older Chinese sys- tem. In general, such Western ideas were not traditionalist or authori- tarian, and were, thus, destructive to the Chinese patriarchal family, to ancestor worship, or to the imperial autocracy. The students brought back from abroad Western ideas of science, of democracy, of parha- mentarianism, of empiricism, of self-reliance, of liberalism, of individual- ism, and of pragmatism. Their possession of such ideas made it impos- sible for them to fit into their own country. As a result, they attempted to change it, developing a revolutionary fervor which merged with the antidynastic secret societies which had existed in China since the Man- chus took over the country in 1644. Japan's victory over China in 1894-1895 in a war arising from a dis- pute over Korea, and especially the Japanese victory over Russia in the war of 1904-1905, gave a great impetus to the revolutionary spirit m China because these events seemed to show that an Oriental country could adopt Western techniques successfully. The failure of the Boxer movement in 1900 to expel Westerners without using such Western techniques also increased the revolutionary fervor in China. As a con- sequence of such events, the supporters of the imperial regime began to lose faith in their own system and in their own ideology. Thev began to install piecemeal, hesitant, and ineffective reforms which disrupted the imperial system without in any way strengthening it. Marriag e between Manchu and Chinese was sanctioned for the first time (1902); Manchuria was opened to settlement by Chinese (1907); the system °* imperial examinations based on the old literary scholarship for adm' s \" sion to the civil service and the mandarinate were abolished and a M in ' istry of Education, copied from Japan, was established (1905); a drafted constitution was published providing for provincial assemblies and i future national parliament (1908); the law was codified (1910). These concessions did not strengthen the imperial regime, but merely intensified the revolutionary feeling. The death of the emperor andot Dowager Empress Tzu Hsi, who had been the real ruler of the country (1908), brought to the throne a two-year-old child, P'u-I.

The real basis of his P wer rested in the new westernized army which he had built up as governor-general of Chihli in 1901-1907. In this force there were five visions, well trained and completely loyal to Yuan. The officers of these . ts had been picked and trained by Yuan, and played principal roles ln C hinese politics after 1916. As president, Yuan opposed almost everything for which Dr. Sun dreamed. He expanded the army, bribed politicians, and eliminated se who could not be bribed. The chief support of his policies e from a ^25 million loan from Britain, France, Russia, and Japan '913.

THE RESURGENCE OF JAPAN TO 191 8 The history of Japan in the twentieth century is quite distinct from that of the other Asiatic peoples. Among the latter the impact of the West led to the disruption of the social and economic structure, the abandonment of the traditional ideologies, and the revelation of tne weakness of native political and military systems. In Japan these events either did not occur or occurred in a quite different fashion. Until 194? Japan's political and military systems were strengthened by Wester'- influences; the older Japanese ideology was retained, relatively intact. even by those who were most energetic copiers of Western ways; an\" the changes in the older social and economic structure were kept with' 11 manageable limits and were directed in a progressive direction. TW real reason for these differences probably rests in the ideological fa°' tor—that the Japanese, even the vigorous Westernizers, retained the oW Japanese point of view and, as a consequence, were allied with the ol\" er Japanese political, economic, and social structure rather than opp° s ^ to it (as, for example, Westernizers were in India, in China, or ' Turkey). The ability of the Japanese to westernize without going i nt ° opposition to the basic core of the older system gave a degree ° discipline and a sense of unquestioning direction to their lives wh' c allowed Japan to achieve a phenomenal amount of westernization vitn out weakening the older structure or without disrupting it. In a sen until about 1950, Japan took from Western culture only superficial an material details in an imitative way and amalgamated these newly a quired items around the older ideological, political, military, and sod structure to make it more powerful and effective. The essential rt e which the Japanese retained from their traditional society and did n adopt from Western civilization was the ideology. In time, as we sna see, this was very dangerous to both of the societies concerned, to Jap and to the West. Originally Japan came into contact with Western civilization in c sixteenth century, about as early as any other Asiatic peoples, but, wit a hundred years, Japan was able to eject the West, to exterminate rfl°"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"THE BUFFER FRINGE  193  lts Christian converts, and to slam its doors against the entrance of y Western influences. A very limited amount of trade was permitted . a restricted basis, but only with the Dutch and only through the Sln gle port of Nagasaki. Japan, thus isolated from the world, was dominated by the military atorship (or shogunate) of the Tokugawa family. The imperial u y had been retired to a largely religious seclusion whence it reigned did not rule. Beneath the shogun the country was organized in a reditary hierarchy, headed by local feudal lords. Beneath these lords e Were, in descending ranks, armed retainers (samurai), peasants, sans, and merchants. The whole system was, in theory at least, rigid unchanging, being based on the double justification of blood and religi on This was in obvious and sharp contrast with the social or- o nation of China, which was based, in theory, on virtue and on c ational training. In Japan virtue and ability were considered to be • , lt:ar y rather than acquired characteristics, and, accordingly, each \" Cla ' class had innate differences which had to be maintained bv ictjqns on intermarriage. The emperor was of the highest level, being ended from the supreme sun goddess, while the lesser lords were ended from lesser gods of varying degrees of remoteness from the goddess. Such a point of view discouraged all revolution or social ge and all \"circulation of the elites,\" with the result that China's mu ltipli l icity of dynasties and rise and fall of families was matched in r 1 by a single dynasty whose origins ran back into the remote tiet-K tne dominant individuals of Japanese public life in the twen- J cer itury were members of the same families and clans which were \"iinating J ap anese life centuries ago. m this basic idea flowed a number of beliefs which continued to be pted by most Japanese almost to the present.

This Japanese ideology was as antithetical to the outlook of the Christian West as any which the West encountered in its contacts with other civilizations. It was also an ideology which was peculiarly fitted to resist the intrusion of Western ideas. As a result, Japan was able to accept and to incorporate into its way of life all kinds of Western tech- niques and material culture without disorganizing its own outlook or its own basic social structure. The Tokugawa Shogunate was already long past its prime when, i° 1853, the \"black ships\" of Commodore Matthew Perry sailed into Toky 0 Bay. That these vessels could move against the wind, and carried g unS more powerful than any the Japanese had ever imagined, was a gr eat shock to the natives of Nippon. The feudal lords who had been growing restive under Tokugawa rule used this event as an excuse to end that rule. These lords, especially the representatives of four western clans* demanded that the emergency be met by abolishing the shogunate and restoring all authority to the hands of the emperor. For more than a decade the decision whether to open Japan to the West or to try t0 continue the policy of exclusion hung in the balance. In 186 3-1866 » series of naval demonstrations and bombardments of Japanese ports oy Western Powers forced the opening of Japan and imposed on the country a tariff agreement which restricted import duties to 5 percent until 1899* A new and vigorous emperor came to the throne and accepted th e resignation of the last shogun (1867). Japan at once embarked on policy of rapid Westernization.

Basically, the form and functioning of the constitution was of little significance, for the country continued to be run by the Meiji oligarchy through their domination of the army and navy, the bureaucracy, economic and social life, and the opinion-forming agencies such as education and religion- In political life this oligarchy was able to control the emperor, the Privy Council, the House of Peers, the judiciary, and the bureaucracy' This left only one possible organ of government, the Diet, through which the oligarchy might be challenged. Moreover, the Diet had only one means (its right to pass the annual budget) by which it could strike back at the oligarchy. This right was of little significance so long as the oligarchy did not want to increase the budget, since the budget ot the previous year would be repeated if the Diet rejected the budget of the following year. However, the oligarchy could not be satisfied with » repetition of an earlier budget, for the oligarchy's chief aim, after they had ensured their own wealth and power, was to westernize Jap atl rapidly enough to be able to defend it against the pressure of the Great Powers of the West. All these things required a constantly growing budget, and thus ga ye the Diet a more important role than it would otherwise have had. This role, however, was more of a nuisance than a serious restriction on the power of the Meiji oligarchy because the power of the Diet could be overcome in various ways. Originally, the oligarchy planned to g lV the Imperial Household such a large endowment of property that l\" income would be sufficient to support the army and navy outside tn national budget. This plan was abandoned as impractical, although the In 1 \" perial Household and all its rules were put outside the scope of the c°\" stitution. Accordingly, an alternative plan was adopted: to control tn elections to the Diet so that its membership would be docile to tn wishes of the Meiji oligarchy. As we shall see, controlling the e ' e tions to the Diet was possible, but ensuring its docility was quite different matter. The elections to the Diet could be controlled in three ways: D ). restricted suffrage, by campaign contributions, and by bureaucrat manipulation of the elections and the returns. The suffrage was r stricted for many years on a property basis, so that, in 1900, only ° person in a hundred had the right to vote. The close alliance betrvve e the Meiji oligarchy and the richest members of the expanding econon 1 system made it perfectly easy to control the flow of campaign cont butions. And if these two methods failed, the Meiji oligarchy control' both the police and the prefectural bureaucracy which supervised £ elections and counted the returns.

Inese methods were used from the beginning. In the first Diet of 1889, Songsters employed by the oligarchy prevented opposition members from Bering the Diet chamber, and at least twenty-eight other members Ve re bribed to shift their votes. In the elections of 1892 violence was se d, mostly in districts opposed to the government, so that 25 persons v ere killed and 388 were injured. The government still lost that election ut continued to control the Cabinet. It even dismissed eleven prefectural governors who had been stealing votes, as much for their failure to steal enough as for their action in stealing any. When the resulting Diet re- used to appropriate for an enlarged navy, it was sent home for eighteen a ys, and then reassembled to receive an imperial rescript which gave 1.8 _ion yen over a six-year period from the Imperial Household for the project and went on to order all public officials to contribute one-tenth 0 their salaries each year for the duration of the naval building program hich the Diet had refused to finance. In this fashion, the Diet's control mcreased appropriations was circumvented by the Meiji oligarchy's c °ntrol of the emperor. ' • *n view of the dominant position of the Meiji oligarchy in Japanese e from 1867 unt il after 1922, it would be a mistake to interpret such CCu rrences as unruly Diets, the growth of political parties, or even the scablishment of adult manhood suffrage (in 1925) as such events would e mterpreted in European history. In the West we are accustomed to ar rations about heroic struggles for civil rights and individual liberties, °r about the efforts of commercial and industrial capitalists to capture at eas t a share of political and social power from the hands of the landed a nstocracy, the feudal nobility, or the Church. We are acquainted with ftovements by the masses for political democracy, and with agitations v peasants and workers for economic advantages. All these movements, ich ^11 the pages of European history books, are either absent or have n entirely different significance in Japanese history. ln Japan history presents a basic solidarity of outlook and of pur- Pose, punctuated with brief conflicting outbursts which seem to be contradictory and inexplicable. The explanation of this is to be found ln the fact that there was, indeed, a solidarity of outlook but that this solidarity was considerably less solid than it appeared, for, beneath it, J a panese society was filled with fissures and discontents. The solidarity * outlook rested on the ideology which we have mentioned. This geology, sometimes called Shintoism, was propagated by the upper cesses, especially by the Meiji oligarchy but was more sincerely em- ra ced by the lower classes, especially by the rural masses, than it was y the oligarchy which propagated it. This ideology accepted an au- n °ritarian, hierarchical, patriarchal society, based on families, clans, and"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"198  TRAGEDY AND HOPE nation, culminating in respect and subordination to the emperor. In this system there was no place for individualism, self-interest, human liberties, or civil rights. In general, this system was accepted by the mass of the Japanese peo- ples. As a consequence, these masses allowed the oligarchy to pursue policies of selfish self-aggrandizement, of ruthless exploitation, and of revolutionary economic and social change with little resistance. The peasants were oppressed by universal military service, by high taxes and high interest rates, by low farm prices and high industrial prices, and by the destruction of the market for peasant handicrafts. They revolted briefly and locally in 1884-1885, but were crushed and never revolted again, although they continued to be exploited. All earlier legislation seeking to protect peasant proprietors or to prevent monopolization of the land was revoked in the 1870's. In the 1880's there was a drastic reduction in the number of landown- ers, through heavy taxes, high interest rates, and low prices for farm products. At the same time the growth of urban industry began to destroy the market for peasant handicrafts and the rural \"putting-out system\" of manufacture. In seven years, 1883-1890, about 360,000 peasant proprietors were dispossessed of 5 million yen worth of land because of total tax arrears of only 114,178 yen (or arrears of only one-third yen, that is, 17 American cents, per person). In the same period, owners were dispossessed of about one hundred times as much land by fore- closure of mortgages. This process continued at varying rates, until, by 1940, three-quarters of Japanese peasants were tenants or part-tenants paying rents of at least half of their annual crop. In spite of their acceptance of authority and Shinto ideology, the pressures on Japanese peasants would have reached the explosive point if safety valves had not been provided for them. Among these pressures we must take notice of that arising from population increase, a problem arising, as in most Asiatic countries, from the introduction of Western medicine and sanitation. Before the opening of Japan, its population had remained fairly stable at 28-30 million for several centuries. This stability arose from a high death rate supplemented by frequent famines and the practice of infanticide and abortion. By 1870 the population began to grow, rising from 30 million to 56 million in 1920, to 73 million in 194 0 ' and reaching 87 million in 1955. The safety valve in the Japanese peasant world resided in the fact that opportunities were opened, with increasing rapidity, in nonagricultura' activities in the period 1870-1920. These nonagricultural activities were made available from the fact that the exploiting oligarchy used its o^n growing income to create such activities by investment in shipping' railroads, industry, and services. These activities made it possible to drain the growing peasant population from the rural areas into the"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"THE BUFFER FRINGE  I99  cities. A law of 1873 which established primogeniture in the inheritance °t peasant property made it evident that the rural population which ^grated to the cities would be second and third sons rather than heads °r families. This had numerous social and psychological results, of which tn e chief was that the new urban population consisted of men detached rom the discipline of the patriarchal family and thus less under the uiiiuence of the general authoritarian Japanese psychology and more nder the influence of demoralizing urban forces. As a consequence, tnis group, after 1920, became a challenge to the stability of Japanese society. In the cities the working masses of Japanese society continued to be e *ploited, but now by low wages rather than by high rents, taxes, or interest rates. These urban masses, like the rural masses whence they had een drawn, submitted to such exploitation without resistance for a much °nger period than Europeans would have done because they continued 0 accept the authoritarian, submissive Shintoist ideology. They were deluded from participation in political life until the establishment of adult manhood suffrage in 1925. It was not until after this date that an y noticeable weakening of the authoritarian Japanese ideology began 0 appear among the urban masses. Resistance of the urban masses to exploitation through economic or social organizations was weakened by the restrictions on workers' or- ganizations of all kinds. The general restrictions on the press, on as- e rnblies, on freedom of speech, and on the establishment of \"secret\" °cieties were enforced quite strictly against all groups and doubly so a gainst laboring groups. There were minor socialistic and laborers' gitations in the twenty years 1890-1910. These were brought to a lolent end in 1910 by the execution of twelve persons for anarchistic Stations. The labor movement did not raise its head again until the ec onomic crisis of 1919-1922. *• he low-wage policy of the Japanese industrial system originated in e se lf-interest of the early capitalists, but came to be justified with e a rgument that the only commodity Japan had to offer the world, d the only one on which it would construct a status as a Great Power, as its large supply of cheap labor.

The only important resources it which could be used to provide export goods to exchange for im- V rted coal, iron, or oil were silk, forest products, and products of the"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"200  TRAGEDY AND HOPE sea. All these required a considerable expenditure of labor, and these products could be sold abroad only if prices were kept low by keeping wage rates down. Since these products did not command sufficient foreign exchange to allow Japan to pay for the imports of coal, iron, and oil which a Great Power must have, Japan had to find some method by which it could export its labor and obtain pay for it. This led to the growth of manufacturing industries based on imported raw materials and the development of such service activities as fishing and ocean shipping- At an early date Japan began to develop an industrial system in which raw materials such as coal, wrought iron, raw cotton, or wool were im- ported, fabricated into more expensive and complex forms, and exported again for a higher price in the form of machinery or finished tex- tiles. Other products which were exported included such forest prod- ucts as tea, carved woods, or raw silk, or such products of Japanese labor as finished silks, canned fish, or shipping services. The political and economic decisions which led to these developments and which exploited the rural and urban masses of Japan were made by the Meiji oligarchy and their supporters. The decision-making powers in this oligarchy were concentrated in a surprisingly small group of men, in all, no more than a dozen in number, and made up, chiefly, of the leaders of the four western clans which had led the movement against the shogun in 1867. These leaders came in time to form a formal, if extra- legal, group known as the Genro (or Council of Elder Statesmen). Of this group Robert Reischauer wrote in 1938: \"It is these men who have been the real power behind the Throne. It became customary for their opinion to be asked and, more important still, to be followed in all matters of great significance to the welfare of the state. No Premier was ever appointed except from the recommendation of these men who became known as Genro. Until 1922 no important domestic legislation, no important foreign treaty escaped their perusal and sanction before & was signed by the Emperor. These men, in their time, were the actual rulers of Japan.\" The importance of this group can be seen from the fact that the Genro had only eight members, yet the office of prime minister was held by a Genro from 1885 to 1916, and the important post of president of the Privy Council was held by a Genro from its creation in 1889 to i9 2: (except for the years 1890-1892 when Count Oki of the Hizen cla° held it for Okuma).

Yet, in spite of these fissures and rivalries, the oligarchy as a whole generally presented a united front against outside groups (such as peasants, workers, intellectuals, or Christians) in Japan itself or against non-Japanese. From 1882 to 1898 Ito was the dominant figure in the Meiji oligarchy, and the most powerful figure in Japan. As minister of the Imperial House- hold, he was charged with the task of drawing up the constitution of 1889; as president of the Privy Council, he guided the deliberations of the assembly which ratified this constitution; and as first prime minister of the new Japan, he established the foundations on which it would operate. In the process he entrenched the Sat-Cho oligarchy so firmly in power that the supporters of Tosa and Hizen began to agitate against the government, seeking to obtain what they regarded as their proper share of the plums of office. In order to build up opposition to the government, they organized the first real political parties, the Liberal Party of Itagaki ( 1881) and the Progressive Party of Okuma (1882). These parties adopted liberal and popular ideologies from bourgeois Europe, but, generally, these were not sincerely held or clearly understood. The real aim of these two groups was to make themselves so much of a nuisance to the pre' vailing oligarchy that they could obtain, as a price for relaxing their attacks, a share of the patronage of public office and of government con- tracts. Accordingly, the leaders of these parties, again and again, sold out their party followers in return for these concessions, generally dis- solving their parties, to re-create them at some later date when their dis- content with the prevailing oligarchy had risen once again. As a result, the opposition parties vanished and reappeared, and their leaders move\" into and out of public office in accordance with the whims of satisfied or discontented personal ambitions. Just as Mitsui became the greatest industrial monopoly of Japan on the basis of its political connections with the prevalent Sat-Cho oligarchy, so Mitsubishi became Japan's second greatest monopoly on the basis 01 its political connections with the opposition groups of Tosa-Hizen. ' n ' deed, iMitsubishi began its career as the commercial firm of the Toss clan, and Y. Iwasaki, who had managed it in the latter role, continue to manage it when it blossomed into .Mitsubishi.

As a esult business enterprise became organized in a few very large monopo- stl c structures, and these (in spite of their size) never acted as inde- pendent powers, even in economic matters, but cooperated in a docile asn 'on with those who controlled government expenditures and govern- ment contracts. Thus they cooperated with the Meiji oligarchy before 9 J i, with the political party leaders in 1922-1932, and with the militarists ter 1932. Taken together, these monopolistic industrial and financial r g a nizations were known as zaibatsu. There were eight important or- ganizations of this kind in the period after World War I, but three were powerful that they dominated the other five, as well as the whole eonornic system.

This victory was , y established before a rivalry appeared between Ito, supported by civil bureaucracy, and Yamagata, supported by the armed services. / 1900 Yamagata won a decisive victory over Ito and formed his sec- cabinet (1898-1900), from which the Ito group was, for the first • ' Cor npletely excluded.

Yamagata had already retired behind the scenes, but still dominated political life through his protege, Katsura. The period 1901-1913 saw an alternation of Katsura and Saionji gov- ernments, in which the former clearly controlled the government, while the latter, through the Liberal Party, won large and meaningless vic- tories at the polls. Both in 1908 and in 1912 Saionji's party won easy vic- tories in general elections held while he was in office, and in both cases Katsura forced him out of office in spite of his majority in the Diet- At this point Katsura's ruthless use of the emperor and the militarists to increase the size and power of the army brought a new factor in t0 Japanese political life by leading to a split with the navy. In 1912, when Saionji and Katsura had each headed two governments since 1901, tne former refused to increase the army by two divisions (for service 1\" Korea). Katsura at once threw the Saionji government out of office by having the minister of war resign.

The navy retaliated the following year by forming an alliance with the Liberals and other anti-Katsufli forces, on the grounds that his frequent use of imperial intervention »» behalf of the lowest partisan politics was an insult to the exalted sanc- tity of the imperial position. For the first and only time, in 1913* a imperial rescript was refused acceptance, by the Liberal Party; KatsiH' 3 had to resign, and a new Cabinet, under Admiral Yamamoto, v, ' a formed (1913-1914). This alliance of the navy, the Satsuma clan, and tn Liberal Party so enraged the Choshu clan that the military and civil' 3 \" 1 wings of that group came together on an anti-Satsuma basis.

By the Treaty of Ports- mouth (1905) Russia renounced her influence in Korea, yielded southern Sakhalin and the lease on Liaotung to Japan, and agreed to a joint renunciation of Manchuria (which was to be evacuated by both Powers and restored to China). Korea, which had been made a Japanese pro' tectorate in 1904, was annexed in 1910. The outbreak of war in 1914 provided a great opportunity for Japanese expansion. While all the Great Powers were busy elsewhere, the Far East was left to Japan. Declaring war on Germany on August 23' 1914, Nipponese troops seized the German holdings on the Shantung Peninsula and the German Pacific islands north of the equator (Marsha\" Islands, Marianas, and Carolines). This was followed, almost immediately (January 1915), by presentation of \"Twenty-one Demands\" on China- These demands at once revealed Japan's aggressive ambitions on the con- tinent of Asia, and led to a decisive change in world opinion about Japa n ' especially in the United States.

In commercial mat- ters the British found German salesmen and their agents offering better service, better terms, and lower prices on goods of at least equal quality, and in metric rather than Anglo-Saxon sizes and measurements. In the colonial field after 1884, Germany acquired African colonies which threatened to cut across the continent from east to west and thus check- mate the British ambitions to build a railway from the Cape of Good Hope to Cairo. These colonies included East Africa (Tanganyika), South-West Africa, Cameroons, and Togo. The German threat became greater as a result of German intrigues in the Portuguese colonies of Angola and Mozambique, and above all by the German encouragement of the Boers of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State before their war with Britain in 1899-1902. In the Pacific area Germany acquired by 1902 the Caroline, Marshall, and Marianas Islands, parts of New Guinea and Samoa, and a base of naval and commercial importance at KiaochaU on the Shantung Peninsula of China. In naval affairs Germany presented her greatest threat as a result of the German Naval bills of 1898, 1900, and 1902, which were designed to be an instrument of coercion against Britain. Fourteen German battleships were launched between 1900 and 1905. As a consequence of these activities Britain joined the anti-German coalition by 1907, the Powers of Europe became divided into two antago- nistic coalitions, and a series of crises began which led, step by step, to the catastrophe of 1914. International affairs in the period 1871-1914 can be examined under four headings: (1) the creation of the Triple Alliance, 1871-1890; (2) the creation of the Triple Entente, 1890-1907; (3) the efforts to bridge the gap between the two coalitions, 1890-1914; and (4) the series 01 international crises, 1905-1914. These are the headings under which we shall examine this subject. THE CREATION OF THE TRIPLE ALLIANCE, 1871-1890 The establishment of a German Empire dominated by the Kingdom oi Prussia left Bismarck politically satisfied. He had no desire to annex any additional Germans to the new empire, and the growing ambitions for colonies and a worldwide empire left him cold. As a satisfied diploma 1 he concentrated on keeping what he had, and realized that France, driven by fear and vengeance, was the chief threat to the situation. His in 1 ' mediate aim, accordingly, was to keep France isolated. This involve\" the more positive aim to keep Germany in friendly relations with Ru s ' sia and the Habsburg Empire and to keep Britain friendly by abstaining from colonial or naval adventures. As part of this policy Bismarck mad e two tripartite agreements with Russia and Austro-Hungary: (a) tne Three Emperors' League of 1873 and (b) the Three Emperors' Allian ce"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"THE FIRST WORLD WAR I 9 I 4-I 9 I 8  2 I 3 '881. Both of these were disrupted by the rivalry between Austria Russia in southeastern Europe, especially in Bulgaria.

The \"tee Emperors' Alliance of 1881 broke down in the \"Bulgarian crisis\" 1885. This crisis arose over the Bulgarian annexation of Eastern roeha, a union which was opposed by Russia but favored by Austria, Us reversing the attitude these Powers had displayed at Berlin in 1878. *• he rivalry between Russia and Austria in the Balkans made it clear to •srnarck that his efforts to form a diplomatic front of the three great pires were based on weak foundations. Accordingly, he made a sec- d string for his bow. It was this second string which became the n ple Alliance. Forced to choose between Austria and Russia, Bismarck °k the former because it was weaker and thus easier to control. He ad e an Austro-German alliance in 1879, following the disruption of A?.. ' lree Emperors' League, and in 1882 expanded it into a Triple lance of Germany, Austria, and Italy. This alliance, originally made r nve years, was renewed at intervals until 1915. After the disrup- on of the Three Emperors' Alliance in 1885, the Triple Alliance be- e the chief weapon in Germany's diplomatic armory, although Bis- rc k, in order to keep France isolated, refused to permit Russia to drift mpletely out of the German sphere, and tried to bind Germany and Sla together by a secret agreement of friendship and neutrality known \"e Reinsurance Treaty (1887). This treaty, which ran for three years, , as not renewed in 1890 after the new Emperor, William II, had dis- ^arged Bismarck. The K aiser argued that the Reinsurance Treaty with ussia was not compatible with the Triple Alliance with Austria and \\v' V - S ' nce Austria an d Russia were so unfriendly. By failing to renew, \"ham left Russia and France both isolated. From this condition they Rurally moved together to form the Dual Alliance of 1894.

Finally, Russia needed foreign loans for railroad building and industrial construction, and these could be obtained most readily in Paris. Accordingly, the agreement was closed during the New Year celebrations of 1894 m tne form of a military convention. This provided that Russia would attack Germany if France were attacked by Germany or bv Italy 7 supported by Germany, while France would attack Germany if Russia were attacked by Germany or by Austria supported by Germany. This Dual Alliance of France and Russia became the base of a triangle whose other sides were \"ententes,\" that is, friendly agreements between France and Britain (1904) and between Russia and Britain (1907). To us looking back on it, the Entente Cordiale between France and Britain seems inevitable, yet to contemporaries, as late as 1898, it must have appeared as a most unlikely event. For many years Britain had followed a policy of diplomatic isolation, maintaining a balance of power on the Continent by shifting her own weight to whatever side of Europe s disputes seemed the weaker. Because of her colonial rivalries with France in Africa and southwest Asia and her disputes with Russia in the Near, .Middle, and Far East, Britain was generally friendly to the Triple Alli- ance and estranged from the Dual Alliance as late as 1902. Her difficul- ties with the Boers in South Africa, the growing strength of Russia in the Near and Far East, and Germany's obvious sympathy with the Boers led Britain to conclude the Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902 in order to obtain support against Russia in China. About the same time, Britain became convinced of the need and the possibility of an agreement wit\" France. The need arose from Germany's direct threat to Britain's most sensitive spot by Tirpitz's naval-building program of 1898. The possibility of agreement with France emerged in the wake of the most acute Angl°' French crisis of modern times, the Fashoda crisis of 1898. At Fashoda on the Nile, a band of French under Colonel Jean Marchand, who had been crossing the Sahara from west to east, came face to face with 3 force of British under General Kitchener, who had been moving up tn e Nile from Egypt in order to subdue the tribes of the Sudan. Each or- dered the other to withdraw. Passions rose to fever heat w hile both sides consulted their capitals for instructions. As a consequence of these 1 11 ' structions the French withdrew.

The Rothschilds, close friends of Edward VII and of France, were linked to the French investment bank, Banque de Paris et des Pays Bas. This, in turn, was the chief influence in selling nine billion rubles of Russian bonds in France before 1914. The most influential of London bankers, Sir Ernest Cassel, a great and mysterious person (1852-191')' had come from Germany to England at the age of seventeen, built up an immense fortune, which he gave away with a lavish hand, was closely connected with Egypt, Sweden, New York, Paris, and Latin America, became one of King Edward's closest personal friends and employer of the greatest wire-puller of the period, that ubiquitous mole, Lord Esher. These generally anti-Prussian influences around King Edward played a significant part in building up the Triple Entente and in strengthening it when Germany foolishly challenged their projects in Morocco in the 1904-1912 period. EFFORTS TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THE TWO COALITIONS, 1890-I914 At the beginning, and even up to 1913, the two coalitions on the inter- national scene were not rigid or irreconcilably alienated. The links be- tween the members of each group were variable and ambiguous. The Triple Entente was called an entente just because two of its three Hi™ 5 were not alliances. The Triple Alliance was by no means solid, especially in respect to Italy, which had joined it originally to obtain supp ort against the Papacy over the Roman question but which soon tried to obtain support for an aggressive Italian policy in the Mediterranean an\" North Africa. Failure to obtain specific German support in these areas, and continued enmity with Austro-Hungary in the Adriatic, made the Italian link with the Central Powers rather tenuous. We shall mention at least a dozen efforts to bridge the gap whiC\" was slowly forming in the European \"concert of the Powers.\" First U 1 chronological order were the Mediterranean Agreements of 1887.

All four of these were associated with the declining r er of Turkey, and offered opportunities for the European Powers to \"port one another's ambitions at the expense of the Ottoman Empire. '098 Italy signed a commercial treatv with France, and followed U P> two years later, by a political agreement which promised French Pport for the Italian ambitions in Tripoli in return for Italian support the French designs in Morocco. The Italians further weakened the lri p!e Alliance in 1902 by promising France to remain neutral in the ent that France was attacked or had to fight \"in defense of her honor * * her security.\" , n a somewhat similar fashion Russia and Austria tried to reconcile former's desire to obtain an outlet through the Dardanelles into the gean with the latter's desire to control Slav nationalism in the Balkans reach the Aegean at Saloniki.

All this tentative goodwill evaporated in the heat of the Bosnian crisis of 1908, as we shall see in a moment. After 1905 the recurrent international crises and the growing solidar- ity of the coalitions (except for Italy) made the efforts to bridge the gap between the two coalitions less frequent and less fruitful. However, two episodes are worthy of attention. These are the Haldane Mission of 191 z and the Baghdad Railway agreement of 1914. In the former, Brit- ish Secretary of State for War Lord Haldane went to Berlin to try t0 restrain Tirpitz's naval program. Although the German Navy had been built in the hope that it would bring England to the conference table, and without any real intention of using it in a war with England, the Germans were not able to grasp the opportunity when it occurred. The Germans wanted a conditional promise of British neutrality in a con- tinental war as a price for suspension of the new naval bill. Since this might lead to German hegemony on the Continent, Haldane could not agree. He returned to London convinced that the Germany of Goethe and Hegel which he had learned to love in his student days was being swallowed up by the German militarists. The last bridge between Lon- don and Berlin seemed down, but in June, 1914, the two countries in- itialed the agreement by which Britain withdrew her opposition to the Baghdad Railway in return for a German promise to remain north 01 Basra and recognize Britain's preeminence on the Euphrates and Persian Gulf. This solution to a long-standing problem was lost in the outbreak of war six weeks later. THE INTERNATIONAL CRISES, 1905-1914 The decade from the Entente Cordiale to the outbreak of war Wit* nessed a series of political crises which brought Europe periodically t0 the brink of war and hastened the growth of armaments, popular hys- teria, nationalistic chauvinism, and solidity of alliances to a point wher* a relatively minor event in 1914 plunged the world into a war of u n ' precedented range and intensity. There were nine of these crises whicn must be mentioned here. In chronological order they are: 1905-1906 The First .Moroccan Crisis and the Algeciras Conference 1908 The Bosnian Crisis 1911 Agadir and the Second Moroccan Crisis 1911 The Tripolitan War 1912 The First Balkan War 1913 The Second Balkan War"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"THE FIRST WORLD WAR I 9 I 4-I 9 I 8  219  1 9' 3 The Albanian Crisis '9*3 The Liman von Sanders Affair '9'4 Sarajevo The first Moroccan crisis arose from German opposition to French designs on Morocco. This opposition was voiced by the Kaiser himself * n a speech in Tangier, after the French had won Italian, British, and Panish acquiescence by secret agreements with each of these countries. «ese agreements were based on French willingness to yield Tripoli to ta jy, Egypt to Britain, and the Moroccan coast to Spain. The Germans Sl sted on an international conference in the hope that their belligerence ou ld disrupt the Triple Entente and isolate France. Instead, when the . erence met at Algeciras, near Gilbraltar, in 1906, Germany found rse 'f supported onlv by Austria.

Fearful that the new Ottoman government might be able to gthen the empire, Austria determined to lose no time in annexing n 'a and Herzegovina, which had been under Austrian military occu- lt °n since the Congress of Berlin (1878). Since the annexation would F r manently cut Serbia off from the Adriatic Sea, Aehrenthal, the Aus- r> foreign minister, consulted with Serbia's protector, Russia. The s foreign minister, Izvolski, was agreeable to the Austrian plan if f! a Xvou ld yield to Izvolski's desire to open the Straits to Russian rs nip s , contrary to the Congress of Berlin.

The crisis became acute but subsided when the Germans gave up their opposition to French plans in Morocco in return for the cession of French territory in the Congo area (November 4, 1911). As soon as Italy saw the French success in Morocco, it seized neigh- boring Tripoli, leading to the Tripolitan war between Italy and Turkey (September 28, 1911). All the Great Powers had agreements with Italy not to oppose her acquisition of Tripoli, but they disapproved of her methods, and were alarmed to varying degrees by her conquest of the Dodecanese Islands in the Aegean and her bombardment of the Darda- nelles (April, 1912). The Balkan States decided to profit from the weakness of Turkey by driving her out of Europe completely- Accordingly, Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Montenegro attacked Turkey in the First Balkan War ana had considerable success (1912). The Triple Alliance opposed the Ser- bian advance to the Adriatic, and suggested the creation of a new state in Albania to keep Serbia from the sea. A brief war crisis died down when Russia again abandoned the Serbian territorial claims and Austria was able to force Serbia and Montenegro to withdraw from Durazzo and Scutari. By the Treaty of London (1913) Turkey gave up most of her territory in Europe. Serbia, embittered by her failure to obtain the Adri- atic coast, attempted to find compensation in Macedonia at the expense of Bulgaria's gains from Turkey. This led to the Second Balkan Wat' in which Serbia, Greece, Romania, and Turkey attacked Bulgaria. By the ensuing treaties of Bucharest and Constantinople (August-Septem- ber, 1913), Bulgaria lost most of Macedonia to Serbia and Greece, much of Dobruja to Romania, and parts of Thrace to Turkey. Embittered at the Slavs and their supporters, Bulgaria drifted rapidly toward the Trip' e Alliance. Ultimatums from Austria and from Austria and Italy jointly (Octo- ber, 1913), forced Serbia and Greece to evacuate Albania, and made it possible to organize that country within frontiers agreeable to the Con- ference of Ambassadors at London. This episode hardly had time to de- velop into a crisis when it was eclipsed by the Liman von Sanders Affair- Liman von Sanders was the head of a German military mission invited to the Ottoman Empire to reorganize the Turkish Army, an obvious necessity in view of its record in the Balkan Wars. When it became cleat that Liman was to be actual commander of the First Army Corps at Constantinople and practically chief of staff in Turkey, Russia and France protested violently.

The series of crises from April, 1911, to January, 1914, had been al- °st uninterrupted. The spring of 1914, on the contrary, was a period relative peace and calm, on the surface at least. But appearances were Pleading. Beneath the surface each power was working to consolidate own strength and its links with its allies in order to ensure that it ou ld have better, or at least no worse, success in the next crisis, which Ve ryone knew was bound to come. And come it did, with shattering suddenness, when the heir to the Habsburg throne, Archduke Francis er dinand, was assassinated by Serb extremists in the Bosnian city of arajevo on the 28th of June, 1914. There followed a terrible month of ear , indecision, and hysteria before the World War was begun by an Austrian attack on Serbia on July 28, 1914. .

As they advanced, hour by hour, and day bv day, these men assembled theu equipment and organized into larger and larger groups, at first in pi** toons, companies, and regiments, then in divisions and armies. As the)' assembled they were advancing along lines of strategic attack made long before and, as likely as not, the convergence into armies would not be accomplished until the advance had already penetrated deep into enemy territory. As formulated in theory, the final assembly into a comply fighting machine would take place only a brief period before the whole mass hurled itself on an, as yet, only partially assembled enemy force- The great drawback to this plan of mobilization was its inflexibility and its complexity, these two qualities being so preponderant that, once the original signal was given, it was almost impossible to stop the forward thrust of the whole assemblage anywhere short of its decisive impact on the enemy forces in their own country. This meant that an order t0 mobilize was almost equivalent to a declaration of war; that no count\") could allow its opponent to give the original signal much before it g'- lV ' e its own signal; and that the decisions of politicians were necessarily sub- ordinate to the decisions of generals. The alliance system worsened this situation in two ways. On the one hand, it meant that every local dispute was potentially a world war, be- cause the signal to mobilize given anywhere in Europe would start tn machines of war everywhere. On the other hand, it encouraged extrei 11 ' ism, because a country with allies would be bolder than a country wlt no allies, and because allies in the long run did not act to restrain ° n another, either because thev feared that lukewarm support to an a). in his dispute would lead to even cooler support from an ally in one own dispute later or because a restraining influence in an earlier di pute so weakened an alliance that it was necessary to give unrestrain c support in a later dispute in order to save the alliance for the futu\" ' There can be little doubt that Russia gave excessive support to Sen' 1, in a bad dispute in 1914 to compensate for the fact that she had Serbia down in the Albanian disputes of 1913; moreover, Germany g aV Austria a larger degree of support in 1914, although lacking symp at -. with the issue itself, to compensate for the restraint which Germany h a exercised on Austria during the Balkan Wars.

At the same time, the popular newspaper press, in order to s ell papers, played on the same motives and issues, arousing their peo- P'es, driving their own politicians to extremes, and alarming neighbor- m g states to the point where they hurried to adopt similar kinds of action in the name of self-defense. Moreover, democracy made it impos- s'ble to examine international disputes on their merits, but instead trans- °rrned everv petty argument into an affair of honor and national pres- age so that no dispute could be examined on its merits or settled as a mple compromise because such a sensible approach would at once be ed by one's democratic opposition as a loss of face and an unseemly c °mpromise of exalted moral principles. 1 he success of Bismarck's policy of \"blood and iron\" tended to justify e use of force and intimidation in international affairs, and to distort e role of diplomacy so that the old type of diplomacy began to dis- bar. Instead of a discussion between gentlemen to find a workable utl on, diplomacy became an effort to show the opposition how strong e was in order to deter him from taking advantage of one's obvious ea knesses. Metternich's old definition, that \"a diplomat was a man who v 'er permitted himself the pleasure of a triumph,\" became lost com- \" e y, although it was not until after 1930 that diplomacy became the J? tlce °f polishing one's guns in the presence of the enemy, ue mood of desperation among politicians served to make interna- al crises more acute in the period after 1904.

Another kind of nKi closely related to this is the feeling that war now is prefer- e to \\ Var later, since time is on the side of the enemy.

This is a subject which has given rise to much controversy since 1914 and has, in its crudest form, been presented as the theory that war was a result of the machina- tions of \"international bankers\" or of the international armaments mer- chants, or was an inevitable result of the fact that the European capital- ist economic system had reached maturity. All these theories will be examined in another place where it will be shown that they are, at worst, untrue, or, at best, incomplete. However, one fact seems to be beyond dispute. This is the fact that international economic competition was, in the period before 1914, requiring increasing political support British gold and diamond miners in South Africa, German railroad build- ers in the Near East, French tin miners in the southwest Pacific, Amer- ican oil prospectors in Mexico, British oil prospectors in the Near East* even Serbian pork merchants in the Habsburg domains sought and ex- pected to get political support from their home governments. It may ® c that things were always thus. But before 1914 the number of such for- eign entrepreneurs was greater than ever, their demands more urgent' their own politicians more attentive, with the result that international relations were exasperated. It was in an atmosphere such as this that Vienna received news of tn e assassination of the heir to the Habsburg throne on June 28, 1914. Tn e Austrians were convinced of the complicity of the Serbian government, although they had no real proof. We now know that high officials of r ' ie Serbian government knew of the plot and did little to prevent it. T<n s lack of activity was not caused by the fact that Francis Ferdinand ^' aS unfriendly to the Slavs within the Habsburg Empire but, on the con- trary, by the fact that he was associated with plans to appease these Slavs by concessions toward political autonomy within the Habsburg domains and had even considered a project for changing the Dual M° n ' archy of Austrian and Hungarian into a Triple Monarchy of Austria 0 ' Hungarian, and Slav.

On this irresponsible basis, Austria, aving received a promise of support from Germany, sent a forty-eight- °ur ultimatum to Belgrade. This document, delivered on July 23rd, was a r-reaching. It bound Serbia to suppress anti-Habsburg publications, °cietics, and teaching; to remove from Serbian official positions per- on s to be named later by Austria; to allow Hapsburg officials to co- perate with the Serbs inside Serbia in apprehending and trying those ^plicated in the Sarajevo plot; and to offer explanations of various anti- Au strian utterances by Serbian officials. Serbia, confident of Russian support, answered in a reply which was partly favorable, partly evasive, and in one particular at least (use of \"strian judges on Serbian tribunals) negative. Serbia mobilized before aking h cr reply; Austria mobilized against her as soon as it was re- !v ed, and, on July 28th, declared war. The Russian czar, under severe P r essure from his generals, issued, retracted, modified, and reissued an der for general mobilization. Since the German military timetable for ^o-front war provided that France must be defeated before Russian °t>ilization was completed, France and Germany both ordered mobili- >°n on August 1st, and Germany declared war on Russia. As the aer nian armies began to pour westward, Germany declared war n France (August 3rd) and Belgium (August 4th).

This discrepancy existed for many years before the war and began to disappear only in the course of IQI^ As a result of its existence, the first three years of the war witnessed the largest military casualties in human history. These occurred as a result of the efforts of military men to do things which were quite impossible to do. The German victories of 1866 and 1870 were the result of theoretical study, chiefly by the General Staff, and exhaustive detailed training re- suiting from that study. Thev were emphatically not based on experi- ence, for the army of 1866 had had no actual fighting experience for tv° generations, and was commanded by a leader, Helmuth von Moltke, who had never commanded a unit so large as a company previously. Moltke s great contribution was to be found in the fact that, by using the rail- road and the telegraph, he was able to merge mobilization and attack into a single operation so that the final concentration of his forces took place in the enemy country, practically on the battlefield itself, j uSt before contact with the main enemy forces took place. This contribution of Moltke's was accepted and expanded by Court- von Schlieffen, chief of the Great General Staff from 1891 to 19 0 '' Schlieffen considered it essential to overwhelm the enemy in one g re \" initial onslaught. He assumed that Germany would be outnumbered a\" J economically smothered in any fighting of extended duration, a n sought to prevent this bv a lightning war of an exclusively offense e character. He assumed that the next war would be a two-front w» against France and Russia simultaneously and that the former wou' have to be annihilated before the latter was completely mobilized. AboV all, he was determined to preserve the existing social structure of G er ' many, especially the superiority of the Junker class; accordingly! \" c rejected either an enormous mass army, in which the Junker control 0 the Officers' Corps would be lost by simple lack of numbers, or a long' drawn war of resources and attrition which would require a reorganize German economy. The German emphasis on attack was shared by the French Arm) command, but in a much more extreme and even mystical fashion, v n der the influence of Ardant Du Picq and Ferdinand Foch, the Frenc General Staff came to believe that victory depended only on attack a° that the success of any attack depended on morale and not on any ph>' ical factors. Du Picq went so far as to insist that victory did not depen at all on physical assault or on casualties, because the former never 0 curs and the latter occurs only during flight after the defeat.

Tech- ical problems of equipment or maneuvers are of little importance. Ihese ideas of Du Picq were accepted by an influential group in the re nch Army as the only possible explanation of the French defeat in 7°- This group, led by Foch, propagated throughout the army the °ctrine of morale and the offensive a oittrance. Foch became professor ttle Ecole Superieure de Guerre in 1894, and his teaching could be turned up in the four words, \"Attaquez! Attaquez! Toujours, atta- nis emphasis on the offensive a oittrance by both sides led to a con- ttration of attention on three factors which were obsolete by 1914. . le se three Mere (a) cavalry, (b) the bayonet, and (c) the headlong antry assault. These were obsolete in 1914 as the result of three tech- at innovations: (a) rapid-fire guns, especially machine guns; (b) ed-wife entanglements, and (c) trench warfare. The orthodox mili- • leaders generally paid no attention to the three innovations while centrating all their attention on the three obsolete factors. Foch, his studies of the Russo-Japanese War, decided that machine guns barbed wire were of no importance, and ignored completely the °r trenches. Although cavalry was obsolete for assault by the time th • ^ r ' mean War (a fact indicated in Tennyson's \"The Charge of ijl ght Brigade\"), and although this was clearly demonstrated to be n tne American Civil War (a fact explicitly recognized in The Army Navy Journal for October 31, 1868), cavalry and cavalry officers *nued to dominate armies and military preparations.

Yet casualties inflicted on the enemy by bayonet were so few that they hardly appear in the statistics dealing with the subject. The belief of military men that an assault made with high morale could roll through wire, machine guns, and trenches was made even more unrealistic by their insistence that such an offensive unit maintain a straight front. This meant that it was not to be permitted to move further in a soft spot, but was to hold back where advance was easy in order to break down the defensive strong points so that the whole front could precede at approximately the same rate. This was done, they explained, in order to avoid exposed flanks and enemy cross fire on advanced salients. There was some opposition to these unrealistic theories, especially in the German Army, and there were important civilians in all countries who fought with their own military leaders on these issues. Clemenceau in France, and, above all, Lord Esher and the members of the Committee on Imperial Defence in England should be mentioned here. At the outbreak of war in August 1914, both sides began to put into effect their complicated strategic plans made much earlier. On the Get- man side this plan, known as the SchliefFen Plan, was drawn up in io°5 and modified bv the younger Helmuth von Aloltke (nephew of r 'ie Moltke of 1870) after 1906. On the French side the plan was known as Plan XVII, and was drawn up bv Joffre in 1912. The original SchliefFen Plan proposed to hold the Russians, as best a s could be done, with ten divisions, and to face France with a stationary left wing of eight divisions and a great wheeling right and center °' fifty-three divisions going through Holland and Belgium and coming down on the flank and rear of the French armies by passing west 0* Paris. Moltke modified this by adding two divisions to the right wing (one from the Russian front and one new) and eight new divisions t° the left. He also cut out the passage through Holland, making it neces- sary for his right wing to pass through the Liege gap, between tne Maastricht appendix of Holland and the forested terrain of the Ardennes- The French Plan XVII proposed to stop an anticipated German attack into eastern France from Lorraine bv an assault of two enlarged Frenc\" armies on its center, thus driving victoriously into southern Germs' 1 } whose Catholic and separatist peoples were not expected to rally ^ vlt much enthusiasm to the Protestant, centralist cause of a Prussianize\" German Empire.

When Lanrezac slowed up Billow's ad- vance on August 29th, Kluck, who was already a dav's march ahead of Biilow, tried to close the gap between the two bv turning southeastward- This brought his line of advance east of Paris rather than west of that city as originally planned. Gallieni, bringing the Sixth Army from Paris in any vehicles he could commandeer, threw it at Kluck's exposed right flank. Kluck turned again to face Gallieni, moving northwestward in a brilliant maneuver in order to envelop him within the German arc be- fore resuming his advance southeastward. This operation was accom- panied bv considerable success except that it opened a gap thirty mi' eS wide between Kluck and Biilow. Opposite this gap was the B.E.F., which was withdrawing southward with even greater speed than the French- On September 5th the French retreat stopped; on the following dav they began a general counterattack, ordered by Joffre on the insistence o> Gallieni. Thus began the First Battle of the Marne. Kluck was meeting with considerable success over the Sixth French Army, although Biilow was being badly mauled by Lanrezac, when the B.E.F. began to move into the gap between the First and Second Get' man armies (September 9th). A German staff officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Hentsch, ordered the whole German right to fall back to the Aisne River where a front was formed on September 13th by the arrival o> some of the German forces which had been attacking the Belgian forts- The Germans were willing to fall back to the Aisne because they De ' lieved the advance could be resumed when they wished to do so.

An artillery barrage as a necessary preliminary to infantry assault was se d almost from the beginning. It was ineffectual. At first no army had \" e necessary quantity of munitions. Some armies insisted on ordering Grapnel rather than high-explosive shells for such barrages. This resulted ' n a violent controversy between Lloyd George and the generals, the °rrner trying to persuade the latter that shrapnel was not effective gainst defensive forces in ground trenches. In time it should have be- onie clear that high-explosive barrages were not effective either, al- ° u gh they were used in enormous quantities. They failed because: y) earth and concrete fortifications provided sufficient protection to e defensive forces to allow them to use their own firepower against e infantry assault which followed the barrage; (2) a barrage notified e defense where to expect the following infantry assault, so that re- aves could be brought up to strengthen that position; and (3) the doc- lri e of t i le continuous front made it impossible to penetrate the enemy positions on a wide-enough front to break through. The efforts to do ' however, resulted in enormous casualties. At Verdun in 1916 the f ench lost 350,000 and the Germans 300,000. On the Eastern Front the u ssian General Aleksei Brusilov lost a million men in an indecisive at- c k through Galicia (June-August, 1916).

At the terrible Battle of Passchendaele in July 1917, the Germans introduced mustard gas, a weapon which was copied by the British in July 1918. This was the most effective gas used in the war, but it served to strengthen the defense rather than the offense, and was espe- cially valuable to the Germans in their retreat in the autumn of 19'\"' serving to slow up the pursuit and making difficult any really decisive blow against them. The tank as an offensive weapon devised to overcome the defensive strength of machine-gun fire was invented by Ernest Swinton in i9'5- Only his personal contacts with the members of the Committee of Im- perial Defence succeeded in bringing his idea to some kind of realization- The suggestion was resisted by the generals. When continued resistance proved impossible, the new weapon was misused, orders for more were canceled, and all military supporters of the new weapon were removed from responsible positions and replaced by men who were distrustru or at least ignorant of the tanks. Swinton sent detailed instructions to Headquarters, emphasizing that they must be used for the first time i n large numbers, in a surprise assault, without any preliminary artillery barrage, and with close support by infantry reserves. Instead they wet used quite incorrectly. While Swinton was still training crews for the firs 1 150 tanks, fifty were taken to France, the commander who had been trained in their use was replaced bv an inexperienced man, and a mef* eighteen were sent against the Germans. This occurred on September »)' 1916, in the waning stages of the Battle of the Somme.

Although Ludendorff did not carry out this plan with sufficient conviction to give it full success, he did achieve amazing results. The great losses by the British and French in 1917, added to the increase in German strength from forces arriving from the defunct Russian and Romanian fronts, made it possible for Ludendorff to strike a series of sledgehammer blows along the Western Front between Dou3i and Verdun in March and April 1918. Finally, on May 27th, after a brief but overwhelming bombardment, the German flood burst over Chemin des Dames, poured across the Aisne, and moved relentlessly t0 ' ward Paris.

To resist this blockade, e nnany used a four-pronged instrument. On the home front every ort was made to control economic life so that all goods would be Se d in the most effective fashion possible and so that food, leather, an a other necessities would be distributed fairlv to all. The success of ls struggle on the home front was due to the ability\" of two German J^Ws. Haber, the chemist, devised a method for extracting nitrogen from e a ir, and thus obtained an adequate supply of the most necessary c °nstituent of all fertilizers and all explosives. Before 1914 the chief Ur ce of nitrogen had been in the guano deposits of Chile, and, but . r Haber, the British blockade would have compelled a German defeat '9*5 from lack of nitrates. Walter Rathenau, director of the German e ctric Company and of some five dozen other enterprises, organized e German economic system in a mobilization which made it possible r Germany to fight on with slowly dwindling resources. , j n the military side Germany made a threefold reply to the British c kade. It tried to open the blockade by defeating its enemies to the utn and east (Russia, Romania, and Italy). In 1917 this effort was gely successful, but it was too late. Simultaneously, Germany tried to ar down her Western foes by a policy of attrition in the trenches and orce Britain out of the war by a retaliatory submarine blockade cted at British shipping. The submarine attack, as a new method of al warfare, was applied with hesitation and ineffectiveness until 1917. en ll was applied with such ruthless efficiency that almost a million s of shipping was sunk in the month of April 1917, and Britain was en within three weeks of exhaustion of her food supply.

By August of 1918 Germany had given her best, and it had not been adequate. The blockade and the rising tide of American manpower gave the German leaders the choice of surrender or complex economic and social upheaval. Without exception, led by the Junker military commanders, they chose surrender. Diplomatic History, 1914-1918 The beginnings of military action in August 1914 did not mark the end of diplomatic action, even between the chief opponents. Diplomatic activity continued, and was aimed, very largely, at two goals: (a) t0 bring new countries into the military activities or, on the contrary, t0 keep them out, and (b) to attempt to make peace by negotiations. Closely related to the first of these aims were negotiations concerned with t ne disposition of enemy territories after the fighting ceased. Back of all the diplomatic activities of the period 1914-1918 was 8 fact which impressed itself on the belligerents relatively slowly. Tn' s was the changed character of modern warfare. With certain exceptio' 1 the wars of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries had been strug- gles of limited resources for limited objectives. The growth of politic 3 democracy, the rise of nationalism, and the industrialization of war 1 £ to total war with total mobilization and unlimited objectives. In t,lC eighteenth century, when rulers were relatively free from popular i n ' fluences, they could wage wars for limited objectives and could neg 0 ' tiate peace on a compromise basis when these were objectives were attaine or appeared unattainable. Using a mercenary army which fought for p a >' they could put that army into war or out of war, as seemed nccessat)' without vitallv affecting its morale or its fighting qualities. The arrival 0 democracy and of the mass army required that the great body of tn citizens give wholehearted support for any war effort, and made it ul possible to wage wars for limited objectives. Such popular support con* be won only in behalf of great moral goals or universal philosophic val lie or, at the very least, for survival. At the same time the growing induS' trialization and economic integration of modern society made it 1IT1 possible to mobilize for war except on a very extensive basis \\vh' c approached total mobilization. This mobilization could not be directe toward limited objectives. From these factors came total war with tot' mobilization and unlimited objectives, including the total destruction ° unconditional surrender of the enemy. Having adopted such grandi° s goals and such gigantic plans, it became almost impossible to a\"° s"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"THE FIRST WORLD WAR I 9 I 4-I 9 I 8  237  ne continued existence of noncombatants within the belligerent coun- ties or neutrals outside them. It became almost axiomatic that \"who is ot with me is against me.\" At the same time, it became almost impossible 0 compromise sufficiently to obtain the much more limited goals which Would permit a negotiated peace. As Charles Seymour put it: \"Each side a u promised itself a peace of victory. The very phrase 'negotiated peace' e came synonymous with treachery.\" Moreover, the popular basis of °dern war required a high morale which might easily be lowered if the e Ws leaked out that the government was negotiating peace in the middle the fighting. As a consequence of these conditions, efforts to negotiate P e ace during the First World War were generally verv secret and very unsuccessful. *ne change from limited wars with limited objectives fought with e rcenary troops to unlimited wars of economic attrition with unlimited jectives fought with national armies had far-reaching consequences, •je distinction between combatants and noncombatants and between ugerents and neutrals became blurred and ultimately undistinguishable. er national law, which had grown up in the period of limited dynastic af s, made a great deal of these distinctions. Noncombatants had ex- sive rights which sought to protect their ways of life as much as r ssible during periods of warfare; neutrals had similar rights. In return, * *ct duties to remain both noncombatant and neutral rested on these Aiders.\" All these distinctions broke down in 1914-1915, with the it: that both sides indulged in wholesale violations of existing inter- . IQ nal law. Probably on the whole these violations were more exten- (although less widely publicized) on the part of the Entente than ne part of the Central Powers. The reasons for this were that the rmans still maintained the older traditions of a professional army, and lr position, both as an invader and as a \"Central Power\" with limited power and economic resources, made it to their advantage to main- • tne distinctions between combatant and noncombatant and between 'g e rent and neutral. If they could have maintained the former dis- tort, they would have had to fight the enemy army and not the my civilian population, and, once the former was defeated, would 1 G l' tt ' e to f ear from the latter, which could have been controlled ? a minimum of troops.

This was possible be- coi u lnternat 'onal law made a distinction between war goods, which 0e declared contraband, and civilian goods (including food), which"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"238  TRAGEDY AND HOPE could not be so declared. Moreover, the German plans, as we have indi- cated, called for a short, decisive war against the enemy armed forces, and they neither expected nor desired a total economic mobilization or even a total military mobilization, since these might disrupt the existing social and political structure in Germany. For these reasons, German)' made no plans for industrial or economic mobilization, for a long war, or for withstanding a blockade, and hoped to mobilize a smaller propor- tion of its manpower than its immediate enemies. The failure of the Schlieffen plan showed the error of these ideas- Not only did the prospect of a long war make economic mobilization necessary, but the occupation of Belgium showed that national feeling was tending to make the distinction between combatant and nonconi- batant academic. When Belgian civilians shot at German soldiers, t' ie latter took civilian hostages and practiced reprisals on civilians. These German actions were publicized throughout the world by the Britisli propaganda machine as \"atrocities\" and violations of international Wg (which thev were), while the Belgian civilian snipers were excused aS loyal patriots (although their actions were even more clearly viola\" tions of international law and, as such, justified severe German reac- tions).

Turkey, which had been growing closer to Germany since before 1890, offered Germany an alliance on July 27, 1914, when the Sarajevo crisis was at its height. The document was signed secretly on August 1 st, and bound Turkey to enter the war against Russia if Russia attacked Germany or Austria. In the meantime, Turkey deceived the Entente Powers by conducting long negotiations with them regarding its atti- tude toward the war. On October 29th it removed its mask of neutrality by attacking Russia, thus cutting her off from her Western allies by die southern route. To relieve the pressure on Russia, the British made an m- effectual attack on Gallipoli at the Dardanelles (February-December, 1915). Only at the end of 1916 did any real attack on Turkey begiOi this time from Egypt into Mesopotamia, where Baghdad was captured i fl March 1917, and the way opened up the valley as well as across Pales- tine to Syria. Jerusalem fell to General Allenbv in December 19' 7' and the chief cities of Syria fell the following October (1918). Bulgaria, still smarting from the Second Balkan War (1913), in whicO it had lost territory to Romania, Serbia, Greece, and Turkey, was frofl 1 the outbreak of war in 1914 inclined toward Germany, and ^ v;lS strengthened in that inclination by the Turkish attack on Russia i n October. Both sides tried to buy Bulgaria's allegiance, a process ' n which the Entente Powers were hampered by the fact that Bulgaria s ambitions could be satisfied only at the expense of Greece, Romania, ot Serbia, whose support they also desired. Bulgaria wanted Thrace from the Maritsa River to the Vardar, including Kavalla and Saloniki (whicn were Greek), most of Macedonia (which was Greek or Serbian), and Dobruja (from Romania). The Entente Powers offered Thrace to the Vardar in November 1914, and added some of Macedonia in May 19^' compensating Serbia with an offer of Bosnia, Herzegovina, and th e Dalmatian coast. Germany, on the other hand, gave Bulgaria a strip of Turkish territory along the Maritsa River in July 1915, added to this a loan of 200,000,000 francs six weeks later, and, in September i9'5' accepted all Bulgaria's demands provided they were at the expense oI belligerent countries. Within a month Bulgaria entered the war by af ' tacking Serbia (October 11, 1915). It had considerable success, driving westward across Serbia into Albania, but exposed its left flank in this process to an attack from Entente forces which were already base\" on Saloniki. This attack came in September 1918, and within a mon^ forced Bulgaria to ask for an armistice (September ^oth). This marke 1 the first break in the united front of the Central Powers.

At that ^ Romania consisted of three parts (Moldavia, Wallachia, and Do- ru ) a ) and had ambitions to acquire Bessarabia from Russia and Transyl- ania from Hungary. It did not seem possible that Romania could get oth of these, yet that is exactly what happened, because Russia was ef eated by Germany and ostracized by the Entente Powers after its . v °Iution in 1917, while Hungary was defeated by the Entente Powers 1918. The Romanians were strongly anti-Russian after 1878, but ls feeling decreased in the course of time, while animosities against e Central Powers rose, because of the Hungarian mistreatment of the °manian minority in Transylvania. As a result, Romania remained utral in 1914. Efforts by the Entente Powers to win her to their e were vain until after the death of King Carol in October 1914. e Romanians asked, as the price of their intervention on the Entente e i Transylvania, parts of Bukovina and the Banat of Temesvar, 500,000 e nte troops in the Balkans, 200,000 Russian troops in Bessarabia, and 4 Ua l status with the Great Powers at the Peace Conference. For this they H mised to attack the Central Powers and not to make a separate peace. ty the heavy casualties suffered by the Entente Powers in 1916 Drought them to the point of accepting these terms. They did so in jgust of that year, and Romania entered the war ten days later. The tral Powers at once overran the country, capturing Bucharest in c ernber. The Romanians refused to make peace until the German ad- Ce to the Marne in the spring of 1918 convinced them that the J Powers were going to win. Accordingly, they signed the Treaty Bucharest w j tn G erman y (M a y £ 1918) by which they gave Dobruja ulgaria, but obtained a claim to Bessarabia, which Germany had v iously taken from Russia. Germany also obtained a ninety-year lease the Romanian oil wells. hough the Entente efforts to set Greece into the war were the protracted and most unscrupulous of the period, they were un- eessful so long as King Constantine remained on the throne (to ^ e I 9 I 7). Greece was offered Smyrna in Turkey if it would give v alla to Bulgaria and support Serbia.

When German and Bulgarian forces began to occupy portions of Greek .Macedonia, the Entente Powers blockaded Greece and sent an ultimatum asking for demobiliza- tion of the Greek Army and a responsible government in Athens (June, 1916). The Greeks at once accepted, since demobilization made it less likely they could be forced to make war on Bulgaria, and the demand for responsible-government could be met without bringing Venizelos back to office. Thus frustrated, the Entente Powers established a ne* provisional Greek government under Venizelos at their base at Salonika There he declared war on the Central Powers (November 1916). i ne Entente then demanded that the envoys of the Central Powers be ex- pelled from Athens and that war materials within control of the Athenian government be surrendered. These demands were rejected (November 3°> 1916). Entente forces landed at the port of Athens (Piraeus) on the same day, but stayed only overnight, being replaced by an Entente block- ade of Greece. The Venizelos government was recognized by Britain (December 1916), but the situation dragged on unchanged. In Ju ,ie 1917, a new ultimatum was sent to Athens demanding the abdication of King Constantine. It was backed up by a seizure of Thessaly and Corinth, and was accepted at once. Venizelos became premier of tne Athens government, and declared war on the Central Powers the ne* day (June 27, 1917). This gave the Entente a sufficient base to drive up the Vardar Valley, under French General Louis Franchet d'EspereV' and force Bulgaria out of the war. At the outbreak of war in 1914, Italy declared its neutrality on the grounds that the Triple Alliance of 1882, as renewed in 1912, bound it to support the Central Powers only in case of a defensive war an that the Austrian action against Serbia did not fall in this category. T° the Italians, the Triple Alliance was still in full force and thus they were entitled, as provided in Article VII, to compensation for any Austria territorial gains in the Balkans. As a guarantee of this provision, tn Ital'ans occupied the Valona district of Albania in November 19'^' Efforts of the Central Powers to bribe Italy into the war were difficu because the Italian demands were largely at the expense of Austria. TheS demands included the South Tyrol, Gorizia, the Dalmatian Islands, a' 1 Valona, with Trieste a free city. A great public controversy took p' !lC in Italy between those who supported intervention in the war on tfl Entente side and those who wished to remain neutral.

This last factor made it possible for Russia to organize a \"Czech Legion\" of over 100,000 men. German reinforcements to the Austria 11 front in Galicia in 1915 made possible a great Austro-German offensive which crossed Galicia and bv September had taken all of Poland and Lithuania. In these operations the Russians lost about a million men- Thev lost a million more in the \"Brusilov\" counterattack in 1916 which reached the Carpathians before it was stopped by the arrival of German reinforcements from France. By this time the prestige of the czarist government had fallen so low that it was easily replaced by a parliamen- tarv government under Kerensky in March 1917. The new government tried to carry on the war, but misjudged the temper of the Russian pe°\" pie. As a result the extreme Communist group, known as Bolsheviks, were able to seize the government in November 1917, and hold it by promiS' ing the weary Russian people both peace and land. The German de- mands, dictated bv the German General Staff, were so severe that the Bolsheviks refused to sign a formal peace, but on March 3, 1918, wet e forced to accept the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. By this treaty Russia lost Finland, Lithuania, the Baltic Provinces, Poland, the Ukraine and Trans- caucasia. German efforts to exploit these areas in an economic sense dur- ing the war were not successful. The Japanese intervention in the war on August 23, 1914, was de- termined completely bv its ambitions in the Far East and the Pacing area. It intended to use the opportunity arising from the Great Powers concern with Europe to win concessions from China and Russia and to replace Germany, not onlv in its colonial possessions in the East hu also to take over its commercial position so far as possible. The German island colonies north of the equator were seized at once, and the German concession at Kiaochow was captured after a brief siege. In January 1915, \"Twenty-one Demands\" were presented to China in the form ° an ultimatum, and largelv accepted. These demands covered accessio to the German position in Shantung, extension of Japanese leases l!1 Manchuria, with complete commercial libertv for the Japanese in tha area, extensive rights in certain existing iron and steel enterprises ° North China, and the closing of China's coast to anv future foreig n concessions. A demand for the use of Japanese advisers in Chinese pol' 0 ' cal, military, and financial matters was rejected, and withdrawn. ^ July 3, 1916, Japan won Russian recognition of its new position in Chin- in return for her recognition of the Russian penetration into Oute Mongolia. New concessions were won from China in February I 9 , ' ? and accepted by the United States in November in the so-called Lansing Ishii Notes.

With the support of Great Britain and the United States, thev n ued at Vladivostok in April 1918, and began to move westward along e route of the Trans-Siberian Railway. The Czech Legion on the Rus- ; *\" front had already rebelled against Bolshevik rule and was fighting s Way eastward along the same railroad. The Czechs were eventually ac uated to Europe, while the Japanese continued to hold the eastern «d of the railroad, and gave support to the anti-Bolshevik factions in the *U War. After a year or more of confused fighting, it became clear that c anti-Bolshevik factions would be defeated and that the Japanese ould expect no further concessions from the Bolsheviks. Accordingly, they evacuated Vladivostok in October 1922. Undoubtedly, the most numerous diplomatic agreements of the war- me period were concerned with the disposition of the Ottoman Em- P re - As early as February 1915, Russia and France signed an agreement v which Russia was given a free hand in the East in return for giving r anee a free hand in the West. This meant that Russia could annex \"nstantinople and block the movement for an independent Poland, 11, e France could take Alsace-Lorraine from Germany and set up a vv \\ independent state under French influence in the Rhineland. A ( >nth later, in March 1915, Britain and France agreed to allow Russia annex the Straits and Constantinople. The immediate activities of the tente Powers, however, were devoted to plans to encourage the Arabs rebel against the sultan's authority or at least abstain from supporting War efforts. The chances of success in these activities were increased v we fact that the Arabian portions of the Ottoman Empire, while °minally subject to the sultan, were already breaking up into numer- s petty spheres of authority, some virtually independent. The Arabs, 0 were a completely separate people from the Turks, speaking a e nntic rather than a Ural-Altaic language and who had remained largely oniadic in their mode of life while the Turks had become almost com- P Wely a peasant people, were united to the Ottoman peoples by little °re than their common allegiance to the Muslim religion. This connec- 1 0f i had been weakened by the efforts to secularize the Ottoman state ^u by the growth of Turkish nationalism which called forth a spirit Arabic nationalism as a reaction to it. ln 1915-1916 the British high commissioner in Egypt, Sir Henry c Mahon, entered into correspondence with the Sherif Hussein of e cca. While no binding agreement was signed, the gist of their dis- ussions was that Britain would recognize the independence of the ^abs if they revolted against Turkey. The area covered by the agree- ment included those parts of the Ottoman Empire south of the 37th e gtee of latitude except Adana, Alexandretta, and \"those portions of"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"24-6   TRAGEDY AND HOPE Syria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Horns, Hama, and Aleppo, [which] cannot be said to be purely Arab.\" In addition, Aden was excepted, while Baghdad and Basra were to have a \"special admin- istration.\" The rights of France in the whole area were reserved, the existing British agreements with various local sultans along the shores of the Persian Gulf were to be maintained, and Hussein was to use British advisers exclusively after the war. Extended controversy has risen from this division of areas, the chief point at issue being whether the statement as worded included Palestine in the area which was granted to the Arabs or in the area which was reserved. The interpretation of these terms to exclude Palestine from Arab hands was subsequently made by McMahoU on several occasions after 1922 and most explicitly in 1937. While McMahon was negotiating with Hussein, the Government 01 India, through Percy Cox, was negotiating with Ibn-Saud of Nejd, ana, in an agreement of December 26, 1915, recognized his independence m return for a promise of neutrality in the war. Shortly afterward, on May 16, 1916, an agreement, known as the Sykes-Picot agreement from the names of the chief negotiators, was signed between Russia, France, and Britain. Early in 1917 Italy was added to the settlement. It parti- tioned the Ottoman Empire in such a way that little was left to the Turks except the area within 200 or 250 miles of Ankara. Russia W3 5 to get Constantinople and the Straits, as well as northeastern Anatolia, including the Black Sea coast; Italy was to get the southwestern coast of Anatolia from Smyrna to Adalia; France was to get most of eastern Anatolia, including Mersin, Adana, and Cilicia, as well as Kurdistan, Alexandretta, Syria, and northern Mesopotamia, including Mosul; Britai 11 was to get the Levant from Gaza south to the Red Sea, Trans Jordan, most of the Syrian Desert, all of Mesopotamia south of Kirkuk (includ' ing Baghdad and Basra), and most of the Persian Gulf coast of Arabia. ^ was also envisaged that western Anatolia around Smyrna would go to Greece. The Holy Land itself was to be internationalized. The next document concerned with the disposition of the Ottoman Empire was the famous \"Balfour Declaration\" of November 1917. Prob- ably no document of the wartime period, except Wilson's Fourteen Points, has given rise to more disputes than this brief statement of l e * than eleven lines. Much of the controversy arises from the belief that i c promised something to somebody and that this promise was in conflict with other promises, notably with the \"McMahon Pledge\" to She rl Hussein. The Balfour Declaration took the form of a letter froi 11 British Foreign Secretary Arthur James Balfour to Lord Rothschild, on e of the leading figures in the British Zionist movement.

Ussein was so distressed when he heard of it that he asked for an ex- planation, and was assured by D. G. Hogarth, on behalf of the British government, that \"Jewish settlement in Palestine would only be allowed so far as would be consistent with the political and economic freedom the Arab population.\" This reassurance apparently was acceptable to Ussein, but doubts continued among other Arab leaders. In answer to re quest from seven such leaders, on June 16, 1918, Britain gave a Public answer which divided the Arab territories into three parts: (A) e Arabian peninsula from Aden to Akabah (at the head of the Red ea ), where the \"complete and sovereign independence of the Arabs\" was rec ognized; (/;) the area under British military occupation, covering A uthern Palestine and southern Mesopotamia, where Britain accepted e principle that government should be based \"on the consent of the 5 'verned\"; and (c) the area still under Turkish control, including Syria . northern Mesopotamia, where Britain assumed the obligation to t've for \"freedom and independence.\" Somewhat similar in tone was joint Anglo-French Declaration of November 7, 1918, just four days . ore hostilities ended in the war. It promised \"the complete and final Nation of the peoples who have for so long been oppressed by the Urk and the setting up of national governments and administrations lat shall derive their authority from the free exercise of the initiative a choice of the indigenous populations.\" *here have been extended discussions of the compatibility of the r 'ous agreements and statements made by the Great Powers regarding e disposition of the Ottoman Empire after the war. This is a difficult r oblem in view of the inaccuracy and ambiguity of the wording of °st of these documents. On the other hand, certain facts are quite evi- bt. There is a sharp contrast between the imperialist avarice to be Und in the secret agreements like Svkes-Picot and the altruistic tone of e publicly issued statements; there is also a sharp contrast between the uor of the British negotiations with the Jews and those with the r abs regarding the disposition of Palestine, with the result that Jews a Arabs were each justified in believing that Britain would promote"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"248  TRAGEDY AND HOPE their conflicting political ambitions in that area; these beliefs, whether based on misunderstanding or deliberate deception, subsequently served to reduce the stature of Britain in the eves of both groups, although both had previously held a higher opinion of British fairness and gen- erosity than of any other Power; lastly, the raising of false Arab hopes and the failure to reach any clear and honest understanding regarding Svria led to a long period of conflict between the Syrians and the French government, which held the area as a mandate of the League of Nations after 1923. As a result of his understanding of the negotiations with McMahon, Hussein began an Arab revolt against Turkey on June 5, 1916. From that point on, he received a subsidy of £ 225,000 a month from Britain. The famous T. E. Lawrence, known as \"Lawrence of Arabia,\" who had been an archaeologist in the Near East in 1914, had nothing to do with the negotiations with Hussein, and did not join the revolt until October 1916- When Hussein did not obtain the concessions he expected at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, Lawrence sickened of the whole affair and eventually changed his name to Shaw and tried to vanish from public view. The Arab territories remained under military occupation until the legal establishment of peace with Turkey in 1923. Arabia itself was under a number of sheiks, of which the chief were Hussein in Hejaz and Ibn-Saud in Nejd. Palestine and Mesopotamia (now called Iraq) were under British military occupation. The coast of Svria was under French military occupation, while the interior of Syria (including the Alepp 0 ' Damascus railway line) and Transjordan were under an Arab force led by Emir Feisal, third son of Hussein of Mecca. Although an Ameri- can commission of inquiry, known as the King-Crane Commission (1919), and a \"General Syrian Congress\" of Arabs from the whole Fer- tile Crescent recommended that France be excluded from the area, that Syria-Palestine be joined to form a single state with Feisal as king, that the Zionists be excluded from Palestine in any political role, as well as other points, a meeting of the Great Powers at San Remo in April 19 20 set up two French and two British mandates. Svria and Lebanon went to France, while Iraq and Palestine (including Transjordan) went to Britain' There were Arab uprisings and great local unrest following these de- cisions. The resistance in Syria was crushed by the French, who then advanced to occupy the interior of Svria and sent Feisal into exile. The British, who by this time were engaged in a rivalry (over petroleum resources and other issues) with the French, set Feisal up as king )0 Iraq under British protection (1921) and placed his brother Abdullah in a similar position as King of Transjordan (1923).

His kingdom of Hejaz was annexed by Ibn-Saud in '9^6. After 1932 this whole area was known as Saudi Arabia. The most important diplomatic event of the latter part of the First vv orld War was the intervention of the United States on the side of the entente Powers in April 1917. The causes of this event have been analyzed at great length. In general there have been four chief reasons 8 ly en for the intervention from four quite different points of view. *hese might be summarized as follows: (1) The German submarine at- acks on neutral shipping made it necessary for the United States to go to ^ar to secure \"freedom of the seas\"; (2) the United States was influenced y subtle British propaganda conducted in drawing rooms, universities, and ne press of the eastern part of the country where Anglophilism was ra nipant among the more influential social groups; (3) the United States Was inveigled into the war by a conspiracy of international bankers and munitions manufacturers eager to protect their loans to the Entente owers or their wartime profits from sales to these Powers; and (4) balance of Power principles made it impossible for the United States 0 allow Great Britain to be defeated by Germany. Whatever the weight °* these four in the final decision, it is quite clear that neither the govern- ment nor the people of the United States were prepared to accept a eieat of the Entente at the hands of the Central Powers. Indeed, in spite 1 the government's efforts to act with a certain semblance of neutrality, 1 'Was clear in 1914 that this was the view of the chief leaders in the government with the single exception of Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan. Without analyzing the four factors mentioned above, ^ ls quite clear that the United States could not allow Britain to be seated by any other Power. Separated from all other Great Powers by ne Atlantic and Pacific oceans, the security of America required either at the control of those oceans be in its own hands or in the hands of friendly Power. For almost a century before 1917 the United States ad been willing to allow British control of the sea to go unchallenged, ec ause it was clear that British control of the sea provided no threat 0 the United States, but on the contrary, provided security for the nit ed States at a smaller cost in wealth and responsibility than security °uld have been obtained by any other method. The presence of Canada as a British territory adjacent to the United States, and exposed to ^ y asion by land from the United States, constituted a hostage for titish naval behavior acceptable to the United States. The German sub- marine assault on Britain early in 1917 drove Britain close to the door starvation by i ts ruthless sinking of the merchant shipping upon v nich Britain's existence depended.

The fact that the German submarines were acting in retaliation for the illegal British blockade of the continent of Europe and British violations of international law and neutral rights on the high seas, the fact that the Anglo-Saxon heritage of the United States and the Anglophilism of its influential classes made it impossible for the average American to see world events except through the spectacles made by British propaganda; the fact that Americans had lent the Entente billions of dollars which would be jeopardized by a German victory, the fact that the enormous Entente purchases of war materiel had created a boom of prosperity and inflation which would collapse the very day that the Entente collapsed— all these factors were able to bring weight to bear on the American dcci- sion only because the balance-of-power issue laid a foundation on which they could work. The important fact was that Britain was close to defeat in April 1917, and on that basis the United States entered the war. The unconscious assumption by American leaders that an Entente victory was both necessary and inevitable was at the bottom of their failure to enforce the same rules of neutrality and international law against Britain as against Germany. Thev constantly assumed that British violations of these rules could be compensated with monetary damages, while German violations of these rules must be resisted, by force i» necessary. Since they could not admit this unconscious assumption or publicly defend the legitimate basis of international power politics on which it rested, they finally went to war on an excuse which was legally weak, although emotionally satisfying. As John Bassett Moore, America's most famous international lawyer, put it, \"What most decisively contributed to the involvement of the United States in the war was the assertion of a right to protect belligerent ships on which Americans saw fit to travel and the treatment of armed belligerent merchantmen as peaceful vessels. Both assumptions were contrary to reason and to settled law, and no other professed neutral advanced them.\" The Germans at first tried to use the established rules of international law regarding destruction of merchant vessels. This proved so dan- gerous, because of the peculiar character of the submarine itself, British control of the high seas, the British instructions to merchant ships to at- tack submarines, and the difficulty of distinguishing between British ships and neutral ships, that most German submarines tended to attack without warning. American protests reached a peak when the Litsit&W was sunk in this way nine miles off the English coast on May 7, io'5- The Lusitama was a British merchant vessel \"constructed with Govern- ment funds as [an] auxiliary cruiser, . . . expressly included in the navy list published by the British Admiralty,\" with \"bases laid for mounting guns of six-inch caliber,\" carrying a cargo of 2,400 cases of rifle car- tridges and 1,250 cases of shrapnel, and with orders to attack German"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"THE FIRST WORLD WAR I 9 I 4-I 9 I 8 251  submarines whenever possible. Seven hundred and eighty-five of 1,257 Passengers, including 128 of 197 Americans, lost their lives. The incom- petence of the acting captain contributed to the heavy loss, as did also p mysterious \"second explosion\" after the German torpedo struck. The vessel, which had been declared \"unsinkable,\" went down in eighteen minutes. The captain was on a course he had orders to avoid; he was running at reduced speed; he had an inexperienced crew; the portholes \"ad been left open; the lifeboats had not been swung out; and no lifeboat dr iHs had been held. The propaganda agencies of the Entente Powers made full use of the °ccasion. The Times of London announced that \"four-fifths of her pas- sengers were citizens of the United States\" (the actual proportion was '5-6 percent); the British manufactured and distributed a medal which le y pretended had been awarded to the submarine crew by the Ger- man government; a French paper published a picture of the crowds in erhn at the outbreak of war in 1914 as a picture of Germans \"rejoic- In g at news of the sinking of the Liisitaiua. 1 he United States protested violently against the submarine warfare nUe brushing aside German arguments based on the British blockade. Was so irreconcilable in these protests that Germany sent Wilson a ot e on May 4, 1916, in which it promised that \"in the future merchant essels within and without the war zone shall not be sunk without wani- ng and without safeguarding human lives, unless these ships attempt 0 escape or offer resistance.\" In return the German government hoped 1a t the United States would put pressure on Britain to follow the es- ahlished rules of international law in regard to blockade and freedom of le sea. Wilson refused to do so. Accordingly, it became clear to the errnans that they would be starved into defeat unless they could defeat •tain first by unrestricted submarine warfare. Since thev were aware la t resort to this method would probably bring the United States into e war against them, thev made another effort to negotiate peace before esorting to it. When their offer to negotiate, made on December 12, 910, was rejected bv the Entente Powers on December 27th, the group the German government which had been advocating ruthless sub- line warfare came into a position to control affairs, and ordered the resumption of unrestricted submarine attacks on February 1, 1917. Wil- 0,1 was notified of this decision on January 31st. He broke off diplo- latic relations with Germany on February 3rd, and, after two months indecision, asked the Congress for a declaration of war April 3, 1917. he final decision was influenced by the constant pressure of his closest •ssociates, the realization that Britain was reaching the end of her re- •°urces of men, money, and ships, and the knowledge that Germany was P aiming to seek an alliance with Mexico if war began. While the diplomacy of neutrality and intervention was moving along"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"252  TRAGEDY AND HOPE the lines we have described, a parallel diplomatic effort was being di- rected toward efforts to negotiate peace. These efforts were a failure but are, nonetheless, of considerable significance because they reveal the motivations and war aims of the belligerents. They were a failure because anv negotiated peace requires a willingness on both sides to make those concessions which will permit the continued survival of the enemy. In 1914-1918, however, in order to win public support for total mobilization, each country's propaganda had been directed toward a total victory for itself and total defeat for the enemy. In time, both sides became so enmeshed in their own propaganda that it became impossible to admit publicly one's readiness to accept such lesser aims as any ne- gotiated peace would require. Moreover, as the tide of battle waxed and waned, giving alternate periods of elation and discouragement to both sides, the side which was temporarily elated became increasingly at- tached to the fetish of total victory and unwilling to accept the lesser aim of a negotiated peace. Accordingly, peace became possible only when war weariness had reached the point where one side concluded that even defeat was preferable to continuation of the war. This point was reached in Russia in 1917 and in Germany and Austria in 1918. In Germany this point of view was greatly reinforced by the realization that military defeat and political change were preferable to the eco- nomic revolution and social upheaval which would accompany any ef- fort to continue the war in pursuit of an increasingly unattainable vic- tory. From the various efforts to negotiate peace it is clear that Britain was unwilling to accept any peace which would not include the restoration of Belgium or which would leave Germany supreme on the Continent or in a position to resume the commercial, naval, and colonial rivalry which had existed before 1914; France was unwilling to accept any solu- tion which did not restore Alsace-Lorraine to her; the German High Command and the German industrialists were determined not to give up all the occupied territory in the west, but were hoping to retain Lor- raine, part of Alsace, Luxembourg, part of Belgium, and Longwy in France because of the mineral and industrial resources of these areas. The fact that Germany had an excellent supply of coking coal with an inadequate supply of iron ore, while the occupied areas had plenty of the latter but an inadequate supply of the former, had a great deal to do with the German objections to a negotiated peace and the ambiguous terms in which their war aims were discussed. Austria was, until the death of Emperor Francis Joseph in 1916, unwilling to accept any peace which would leave the Slavs, especially the Serbs, free to continue their nationalistic agitations for the disintegration of the Habsburg Empire- On the other hand, Italy was determined to exclude the Habsburg Em- pire from the shores of the Adriatic Sea, while the Serbs were even"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"THE FIRST WORLD WAR I 9 I 4-I 9 I 8  253  more determined to reach those shores by the acquisition of Habsburg- r uied Slav areas in the western Balkans. After the Russian revolutions of lQI 7> many of these obstacles to a negotiated peace became weaker. *TM \\ r • *    or    in e Vatican, working through Cardinal Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII) sought a negotiated peace which would prevent the destruction of the iabsburg Empire, the last Catholic Great Power in Europe. Prominent men m all countries, like Lord Lansdowne (British foreign secretary be- ore 1914), became so alarmed at the spread of Socialism that they were ling to make almost any concessions to stop the destruction of civi- ized ways of life by continued warfare. Humanitarians like Henry Ford r domain Rolland became increasingly alarmed at the continued slaugh- cr - But, for the reasons we have already mentioned, peace remained elu- Iv e Until the great German offensives of 1918 had been broken. After what Ludendorff called \"the black day of the German Army\" ^August 8, 1918), a German Crown Council, meeting at Spa, decided ictory was no longer possible, and decided to negotiate for an armistice. us was not done because of a controversy between the crown prince Ludendorff in which the former advised an immediate retreat to e Hindenburg Line\" twenty miles to the rear, while the latter wished m ake a slow withdrawal so that the Entente could not organize an ac k on the Hindenburg Line before winter. Two Entente victories, baint-Quentin (August 31st) and in Flanders (September 2nd) made s dispute moot. The Germans began an involuntary retreat, drenching e ground they evacuated with \"mustard gas\" in order to slow up the utente pursuit, especially the tanks. The German High Command re- oved the chancellor, Herding, and put in the more democratic Prince ax of Baden with orders to make an immediate armistice or face mili- tar y disaster (September 29-October 1, 1918). On October 5th a Ger- an note to President Wilson asked for an armistice on the basis of the ourteen Points of January 8, 1918, and his subsequent principles of . e ptember 27, 1918. These statements of Wilson had captured the paginations of idealistic persons and subject peoples everywhere. The ourteen Points promised the end of secret diplomacy; freedom of the as ; freedom of commerce; disarmament; a fair settlement of colonial auris, with the interests of the native peoples receiving equal weight ! tn tn e titles of imperialist Powers; the evacuation of Russia; the evacu- l0 n and restoration of Belgium; the evacuation of France and the res- ration to her of Alsace-Lorraine as in 1870; the readjustment of the a ian frontiers on nationality lines; free and autonomous development r the peoples of the Habsburg Empire; the evacuation, restoration, and ° aran tee of Romania, Montenegro, and Serbia, with the last-named se- r 'ng free access to the sea; international guarantees to keep the Straits , rin anently opened to the ships and commerce of all nations; freedom the autonomous development of the non-Turkish nationalities of the"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"254  TRAGEDY AND HOPE Ottoman Empire, along with a secure sovereignty for the Turks them- selves; an independent Polish state with free access to the sea and with international guarantees; a League of Nations to afford \"mutual guaran- tees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike\"; and no destruction of Germany or even any alteration of her institutions except those necessary to make it clear when her spokes- men spoke for the Reichstag majority and when they \"speak for the military party and the men whose creed is imperial domination.\" In a series of notes between Germany and the United States, Wilson made it clear that he would grant an armistice only if Germany would withdraw from all occupied territory, make an end to submarine at- tacks, accept the Fourteen Points, establish a responsible government, and accept terms which would preserve the existing Entente military su- periority. He was most insistent on the responsible government, warning that if he had to deal \"with military masters or monarchical autocrats' he would demand \"not negotiations but surrender.\" The German consti- tution was changed to give all powers to the Reichstag; Ludendorff was fired; the German Navy at Kiel mutinied, and the Kaiser fled from Ber- lin (October 29th). In the meantime, the Entente Supreme War Council refused to accept the Fourteen Points as the basis for peace until Colonel House threatened that the United States would makes a separate peace with Germany. They then demanded and received a definition of the meaning of each term, made a reservation on \"the freedom of the seas, and expanded the meaning of \"restoration of invaded territory\" to in* elude compensation to the civilian population for their war losses. O' 1 this basis an armistice commission met German negotiators on November 7th. The German Revolution was spreading, and the Kaiser abdicated on November 9th. The German negotiators received the Entente m»\" itarv terms and asked for an immediate ending of hostilities and of th c economic blockade and a reduction in the Entente demand for machi ,lC guns from 30,000 to 25,000 on the grounds that the difference of 5,0°° was needed to suppress the German Revolution. The last point was con\" ceded, but the other two refused. The armistice was signed on Novem- ber 11, 1918, at 5:00 A.M. to take effect at 11:00 A.M.

Tiiis last poinr was of considerable importance, as the Germans la d systematically looted or destroyed the areas they evacuated in the ast f e ^' months of the war. 1 he negotiations with Wilson leading up to the Armistice of 1918 are °r great significance, since they formed one of the chief factors in subsequent German resentment at the Treaty of Versailles. In these ne gotiations Wilson had clearly promised that the peace treaty with yWrnany would be negotiated and would be based on the Fourteen 0, nts; as we shall see, the Treaty of Versailles was imposed without e gotiation, and the Fourteen Points fared very poorly in its provisions. n a dditionaI factor connected with these events lies in the subsequent a mi of the German militarists that the German Army was never de- bated but was \"stabbed in the back\" by the home front through a com- •nation of international Catholics, international Jews, and international °cialists. There is no merit whatever in these contentions. The German - r my was clearly beaten in the field; the negotiations for an armistice ere commenced by the civilian government at the insistence of the Hl gh Coram and, and the Treaty of Versailles itself was subsequently . gned, rather than rejected, at the insistence of the same High Command order to avoid a military occupation of Germany. By these tactics e German Army was able to escape the military occupation of Ger- ' an V which they so dreaded. Although the last enemy forces did not Ve German soil until 1931, no portions of Germany were occupied y°nd those signified in the armistice itself (the Rhineland and the ree bridgeheads on the right bank of the Rhine) except for a brief (,Cc «pation of the Ruhr district in 1923. The Home Front, 1914-1918 e First World War was a catastrophe of such magnitude that, even a .V, the imagination has some difficulty grasping it. In the year 1916, VVo battles (Verdun and the Somme) casualties of over 1,700,000 c surtered by both sides. In the artillery barrage which opened the n ch attack on Chemin des Dames in April 1017, 11,000,000 shells c \"red on a 30-mile front in 10 days. Three months later, on an 11- e front at Passchendaele, the British fired 4,250,000 shells costing -2,000,000 in a preliminary barrage, and lost 400,000 men in the ensu- ed infantry assault. In the German attack of March 1918, 62 divisions 4'5°o heavy guns and 1,000 planes were hurled on a front only mi ' es wide.

It has been es- timated by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace that the war destroyed over $400,000,000,000 of property at a time when the value of every object in France and Belgium was not worth over $75'\" 000,000,000. Obviously, expenditures of men and wealth at rates like these require\" a tremendous mobilization of resources throughout the world, and could not fail to have far-reaching effects on the patterns of thought and modes of action of people forced to undergo such a strain. Some states were destroyed or permanently crippled. There were profound modifications in finance, in economic life, in social relations, in intellectual outlook, and in emotional patterns. Nevertheless, two facts should be recognized. The war brought nothing really new into the world; rather it sped up processes of change which had been going on for a considerable period and would have continued anyway, with the result that changes which would have taken place over a period of thirty or even fifty years m peacetime were brought about in five years during the war. Also, the changes were much greater in objective facts and in the organization c society than they were in men's ideas of these facts or organization. & was as if the changes were too rapid for men's minds to accept them, ° r > what is more likely, that men, seeing the great changes which were oc- curring on all sides, recognized them, but assumed that they were merely temporar\\' wartime aberrations, and that, when peace came, they would pass away and everyone could go back to the slow, pleasant world 01 1913. This point of view, which dominated the thinking of the 1920 s ' was widespread and very dangerous. In their efforts to go back to iQ'3' men refused to recognize that the wartime changes were more or l eSS permanent, and, instead of trying to solve the problems arising f rorn these changes, set up a false facade of pretense, painted to look like 19'3' to cover up the great changes which had taken place. Then, by acting as if this facade were reality, and by neglecting the maladjusted really which was moving beneath it, the people of the 1920's drifted in a hec«c world of unreality until the world depression of 1920-1935, and the i fl \" ternational crises which followed, tore away the facade and showed tn horrible, long-neglected reality beneath it. The magnitude of the war and the fact that it might last for mor^ than six months were quite unexpected for both sides and were impresse upon them only gradually. It first became clear in regard to consump' tion of supplies, especially ammunition, and in the problem of how l pay for these supplies. In July 1914, the military men were confide\" that a decision would be reached in six months because their mili tar / plans and the examples of 1866 and 1870 indicated an immediate de c1 ' sion. This belief was supported by the financial experts who, w^ 1 greatly underestimating the cost of fighting, were confident that * n"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"THE FIRST WORLD WAR I 9 I 4-I 9 I 8  257  financial resources of all states would be exhausted in six months. By nnancial resources\" they meant the gold reserves of the various nations. 1 ncse were clearly limited; all the Great Powers were on the gold stand- ar d under which bank notes and paper money could be converted into gold on demand. However, each country suspended the gold standard at the outbreak of war. This removed the automatic limitation on the supply of paper money. Then each country proceeded to pay for the War by borrowing from the banks. The banks created the money which ne y lent by merely giving the government a deposit of any size against which the government could draw checks. The banks were no longer united in the amount of credit they could create because they no longer a u to pay out gold for checks on demand. Thus the creation of money in the form of credit by the banks was limited only by the demands of lts borrowers. Naturally, as governments borrowed to pay for their n eeds, private businesses borrowed in order to be able to fill the govern- ment's orders. The gold which could no longer be demanded merely rested in the vaults, except where some of it was exported to pay for u Pplies from neutral countries or from fellow belligerents. As a result, he percentage of outstanding bank notes covered by gold reserves stead- v fell, and the percentage of bank credit covered by either gold or ba nk notes fell even further. JNaturally, when the supply of money was increased in this fashion ast er than the supply of goods, prices rose because a larger supply of oney was competing for a smaller supply of goods. This effect was a de worse by the fact that the supply of goods tended to be reduced X 'Wartime destruction. People received money for making capital 6°ods, consumers' goods, and munitions, but they could spend their on ey only to buy consumers' goods, since capital goods and munitions er e not offered for sale. Since governments tried to reduce the supply consumers' goods while increasing the supply of the other two prod- cts , the problem of rising prices (inflation) became acute. At the same me the problem of public debt became steadily worse because govern- ents were financing such a large part of their activities by bank credit. ese tWo problems, inflation and public debt, continued to grow, even er the fighting stopped, because of the continued disruption of eco- °hiic Hf e and the need to pay for past activities. Only in the period 9 2 o-i 02 y did these two stop increasing in most countries, and they re niained problems long after that. inflation indicates not only an increase in the prices of goods but also . Urease in the value of money (since it will buy less goods).

Since the middle classes of European society', with their bank savings, checking deposits, mort- gages, insurance, and bond holdings, were the creditor class, they were injured and even ruined bv the wartime inflation. In Germany, Poland, Hungary, and Russia, where the inflation went so far that the monetary unit became completely valueless bv 1924, the middle classes were largely destroyed, and their members were driven to desperation or at least to an almost psychopathic hatred of the form of government or the social class that they believed to be responsible for their plight. Since the last stages of inflation which dealt the fatal blow to the middle classes occurred after the war rather than during it (in 1923 in Germany), the hatred was directed against the parliamentary governments which were functioning after 1918 rather than against the monarchical governments which functioned in 1914-1918. In France and Italy, where the inflation went so far that the franc or lire was reduced permanently to one-hfth of its prewar value, the hatred of the injured middle classes was directed against the parliamentary regime which had functioned both during and after the war and against the working class which they felt had profited by their misfortunes. These things were not true in Britain or the United States, where the inflation was brought under control and the monetary unit restored to most of its prewar value. Even in these countries, prices rose by 200 to 300 percent, while public debts rose about 1,000 percent- The economic effects of the war were more complicated. Resources of all kinds, including land, labor, and raw materials, had to be diverted from peacetime purposes to wartime production; or, in some cases, re- sources previously not used at all had to be brought into the productive system. Before the war, the allotment of resources to production hw been made by the automatic processes of the price system; labor aflv raw materials going, for example, to manufacture those goods whicn were most profitable rather than to those goods which were most service' able or socially beneficial, or in best taste. In wartime, however, govern- ments had to have certain specific goods for military purposes; the) tried to get these goods produced by making them more profitable than nonmilitary goods using the same resources, but they were not always successful. The excess of purchasing power in the hands of consumer 5 caused a great rise in demand for goods of a semiluxury nature, like white cotton shirts for laborers. This frequently made it more profit' able for manufacturers to use cotton for making shirts to sell at lug 1 prices than to use it to make explosives. Situations such as these made it necessary for governments to inter' vene directly in the economic process to secure those results whicn could not be obtained by the free price system or to reduce those e vl effects which emerged from wartime disruption. They appealed to t\" patriotism of manufacturers to make things that were needed rather tha'"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"THE FIRST WORLD WAR 1914-1918  259  things which were profitable, or to the patriotism of consumers to put their money into government bonds rather than into goods in short sup- Py • They began to build government-owned plants for war production, either using them for such purposes themselves or leasing them out to private manufacturers at attractive terms. Thev began to ration con- sumers' goods which were in short supply, like articles of food. They De gan to monopolize essential raw materials and allot them to manufac- urers who had war contracts rather than allow them to flow where Pnces were highest. The materials so treated were generally fuels, steel, rubber, copper, wool, cotton, nitrates, and such, although they varied torn country to country, depending upon the supply. Governments be- gan to regulate imports and exports in order to ensure that necessary materials stayed in the country and, above all, did not go to enemy states, h's led to the British blockade of Europe, the rationing of exports to eutrals, and complicated negotiations to see that goods in neutral coun- les w ere not reexported to enemv countries.

There no guarantee that the wages of essential workers would go up faster n the wages of nonessential workers. Certainly the wages of soldiers, 0 Were the most essential of all, went up very little. Thus there was guarantee that labor, if left solely to the influence of wage levels, as usual before 1914, would flow to the occupations where it was most gently needed.

Because of the large number of enterprises involved and the small size of many of them, direct regulation by the government was less likely in the field of agriculture. Here conditions were generally more com- petitive than in industry, with the result that farm prices had shown a growing tendency to fluctuate more widely than industrial prices. This continued during the war, as agricultural regulation was left more com- pletely to the influence of price changes than other parts of the economy- As farm prices soared, farmers became more prosperous than they had been in decades, and sought madly to increase their share of the rain of money by bringing larger and larger amounts of land under cultiva- tion. This was not possible in Europe because of the lack of men, equip' ment, and fertilizers; but in Canada, the United States, Australia, and South America land was brought under the plow which, because of lack of rainfall or its inaccessibility to peacetime markets, should never have been brought under cultivation. In Canada the increase in wheat acreag e was from 9.9 million in the years 1909-1913 to 22.1 million in the years 1921-25. In the United States the increase in wheat acreage was from 47.0 million to 58.1 million in the same period. Canada increased her share of the world's wheat crop from 14 percent to 39 percent in this decade. Farmers went into debt to obtain these lands, and by 1920 v>' cxe buried under a mountain of mortgages which would have been con- sidered unbearable before 1914 but which in the boom of wartime pr° s ' perity and high prices was hardly given a second thought. In Europe such expansion of acreage was not possible, although grass- lands were plowed up in Britain and some other countries. In Europ e as a whole, acreage under cultivation declined, by 15 percent for cereals in 1913-1919. Livestock numbers were also reduced (swine bv 22 p er ' cent and cattle by 7 percent in 1913-1920). Woodlands were cut i° r fuel when importation of coal was stopped from England, Germany'* ° Poland. Since most of Europe was cut off from Chile, which had been the chief prewar source of nitrates, or from North Africa and Germany* which had produced much of the prewar supply of phosphates, the us of these and other fertilizers was reduced.

The declining fertility of the soil and the act that new lands of lesser natural fertility were brought under culti- Wn led to drastic declines in agricultural output per acre (in cereals °ut 15 percent in 1914-1919). ihese adverse influences were most evident in Germany, where the umber of hogs fell from 25.3 million in 1914 to 5.7 million in 1918; e average weight of slaughtered cattle fell from 250 kilos in 1913 to 3o m 191S; the acreage in sugar beets fell from 592,843 hectares in 1914 306,505 in 1919, while the yield of sugar beets per hectare fell from 1 00 kilos in 1914 to 16,350 kilos in 1920.

The blockade of the Central Powers tore the heart °r the prewar integration. When the war ended, it was impossible e place this, because there were many new political boundaries; these idaries were marked by constantly rising tariff restrictions, and the European world had increased both its agricultural and industrial P u t to a point where it was much less dependent on Europe. T e heavy casualties, the growing shortages, the slow decline in qual- • 0r goods, and the gradual growth of the use of substitutes, as well as , .

The in- adequacies of the preparations to deal with the heavy casualties or to provide munitions for the needs of modern war, as well as the shortage or disruption of the supply of civilian goods, led to public agitation. Committees were formed, but proved relatively ineffective, and in most activities in most countries were replaced by single-headed agencies equipped with extensive controls. The use of voluntary or semivoluntary methods of control generally vanished with the committees and were replaced by compulsion, however covert. In governments as wholes a somewhat similar shifting of personnel took place until each Cabinet came to be dominated bv a single man, endowed with greater energ)'* or a greater willingness to make quick decisions on scanty information than his fellows. In this way Lloyd George replaced Asquith in England; Clemenceau replaced a series of lesser leaders in France; Wilson strength- ened his control on his own government in the United States; and, in a distinctly German way, Ludendorff came to dominate the government o* his country. In order to build up the morale of their own peoples and to lower that of their enemies, countries engaged in a variety of activities designed to regulate the flow of information to these peoples. This i n \" volved censorship, propaganda, and curtailment of civil liberties. Thcs were established in all countries, without a hitch in the Central Po\\ve r and Russia where there were long traditions of extensive police author- ity, but no less effectively in France and Britain. In France a State o Siege was proclaimed on August 2, 1914. This gave the government tn right to rule by decree, established censorship, and placed the p°' lC under military control. In general, French censorship was not so sever as the German nor so skillful as the British, while their propaganda V far better than the German but could not compare with the British. T\" e complexities of French political life and the slow movement of its t )U reaucracy allowed all kinds of delays and evasions of control, especial) by influential persons. When Clemenceau was in opposition to the g° eminent in the early days of the war, his paper, L'homme libre, was sus- pended; he continued to publish it with impunity under the nan 1 L'homme enchaine. The British censorship was established on 5, 1914, and at once intercepted all cables and private mail which could reach, including that of neutral countries. These at once became a important source of military and economic intelligence. A Defence the Realm Act (familiarly known as DORA) was passed giving the g° v ernment the power to censor all information. A Press Censorship C\" mittee was set up in 1914 and was replaced by the Press Bureau « n Frederick E. Smith (later Lord Birkenhead)' in 1916.

Parallel with the censor- Up Was the War Propaganda Bureau under Sir Charles Masterman, 'hich had an American Bureau of Information under Sir Gilbert Parker Wellington House. This last agency was able to control almost all . \"nnation going to the American press, and by 1916 was acting as an err »ational news service itself, distributing European news to about 35 American papers which had no foreign reporters of their own. _*he Censorship and the Propaganda bureaus worked together in r 'tain as well as elsewhere. The former concealed all stories of Entente Nations of the laws of war or of the rules of humanity, and reports tn eir own military mistakes or their own war plans and less altruistic ar amis, while the Propaganda Bureau widely publicized the violations , d crudities of the Central Powers, their prewar schemes for mobiliza- n i and their agreements regarding war aims. The German violation of g'an neutrality was constantly bewailed, while nothing was said of e Entente violation of Greek neutrality. A great deal was made of Austrian ultimatum to Serbia, while the Russian mobilization which a precipitated the war was hardly mentioned. In the Central Powers a 0 at deal was made of the Entente \"encirclement,\" while nothing was °f the Kaiser's demands for \"a place in the sun\" or the High Com- arsd s refusal to renounce annexation of any part of Belgium. In gen- > manufacture of outright lies by propaganda agencies was infre- \" ent , and the desired picture of the enemy was built up by a process selection and distortion of evidence until, by 1918, many in the West garded the Germans as bloodthirsty and sadistic militarists, while the r mans regarded the Russians as \"subhuman monsters.\" A great deal made, especially by the British, of \"atrocity\" propaganda; stories of 1 riTlan mutilation of bodies, violation of women, cutting off of children's us, desecration of churches and shrines, and crucifixions of Belgians re widely believed in the West by 1916. Lord Bryce headed a com- e e which produced a volume of such stories in 1915, and it is quite er >t that this well-educated man, \"the greatest English authority on United States,\" was completely taken in by his own stories.

On the whole, the relative innocence and credulity of the average person, who was not yet immunized to propaganda assaults through mediums of mass communication in 1914, made the use of such stories relatively e '~ fective.

These ideals had been given concrete form in Wilsons Fourteen Points. Whether the defeated Powers felt the same enthusiasm for these high ideals is subject to dispute, but they had been promised, on November 5, 1918, that the peace settlements would be negotiated and would be based on the Fourteen Points. When it became clear that the settlements were to be imposed rather than negotiated, that the Four- teen Points had been lost in the confusion, and that the terms of the settlements had been reached by a process of secret negotiations from which the small nations had been excluded and in which power politic played a much larger role than the safety of democracy, there was a revulsion of feeling against the treaties. In Britain and in Germany, propaganda barrages were aimed agaifl* these settlements until, by 1929, most of the Western World had fee'\" ings of smilt and shame whenever thev thought of the Treaty of ^ er ' sallies. There was a good deal of sincerity in these feelings, especially i\" England and in the United States, but there was also a great deal of i n ' sinccrity behind them in all countries.

Certainly there were grounds for criticism, and, equally certainly, the terms of the peace set' tlements were far from perfect; but criticism should have been dirccte rather at the hypocrisy and lack of realism in the ideals of the wartifl 1 propaganda and at the lack of honesty of the chief negotiators in carry ing on the pretense that these ideals were still in effect while they vl0 ' lated them daily, and necessarily violated them.

The failure of the chief negotiators ( a least the Anglo-Americans) to admit this is regrettable, but behind the' reluctance to admit it is the even more regrettable fact that the lack ° political experience and political education of the American and E™J lish electorates made it dangerous for the negotiators to admit the fa c of life in international political relationships.

It was tacitly assumed in October and November, 1918, that ls method was to be used to end the existing war. But this congress ethod could not be used in 1919 for several reasons. The members of e victorious coalition were so numerous (thirty-two Allied and s °ciated Powers) that they could have agreed on terms only slowly after considerable preliminary organization.

In such circumstances, what guarantee would there be even of ulti- mate success?

As a second choice, France wanted \"League with teeth,\" that is, a League of Nations with an internatibna police force empowered to take automatic and immediate action aga\" 15 an aggressor; this was blocked bv the Anglo-Americans. As compe°~v tion for the loss of these first two choices, France accepted, as a th' r choice, an Anglo-American treatv of guarantee, but this was lost in '9'9 by the refusal of the United States Senate to ratify the agreement a n the refusal of Britain to assume the burden alone.

The Locarno Pacts of 19:5 were the first concrete achieverne 0 of this British point of view, as we shall see. To the French argume^ that Germany would get stronger and thus more able to strike westwal' if allowed to grow eastward the British usually replied that the German were equally likely to become satisfied or get mired down in the gr e;1 open spaces of the East. France believed that Germany could be made to keep the peace I') duress, while Britain believed that Germany could be persuaded to k ce r the peace by concessions. The French, especially the political Rigbt 1 France, could see no difference between the Germans of the empire 80 the Germans of the Weimar Republic: \"Scratch a German and you %vl find a Hun,\" they said. The British, especially the political Left, r garded the Germans of the Weimar Republic as totally different fr° the Germans of the empire, purified by suffering and freed from l tyranny of the imperial autocracy; they were prepared to clasp t\" e new Germans to their hearts and to make any concession to encourag them to proceed on the path of democracy and liberalism. When British began to talk in this fashion, appealing to high principles of in te national cooperation and conciliation, the French tended to regard tb as hypocrites, pointing out that the British appeal to principles did fl appear until British interests had been satisfied and until these p r ' nC1 P. could be used as obstacles to the satisfaction of French interests. British tended to reply to the French remarks about the dangers of k n & lish hypocrisy with a few remarks of their own about the dangers French militarism. In this sad fashion, the core of the coalition which beaten Germany dissolved in a confusion of misunderstandings and criminations.     .

We have called the foreign policy of the Left, and a secret policy in of k t ' 1 °^ acte d in support of what we have called the foreign policy e Right. Thus the stated policy of the government and the policy le British people were based on support of the League of Nations, r . ln ternational cooperation, and of disarmament. Yet the real policy was e different. Lord Curzon, who was foreign secretary for four years • °~ ! 9 2 3) called the League of Nations \"a good joke\"; Britain re- e a every effort of France and Czechoslovakia to strengthen the sys- °r collective security; while openly supporting the Naval Disarma- f t onfer ence at Geneva (1927) and the World Disarmament Con- Wi' u 6 9 2(5 -i935), Britain signed a secret agreement with France and • c k e c! disarmament on land as well as on the sea (July 1928) n '!> n ed an agreement with Germany which released her from her Pol' rrnam ent (1935).

Consequently, differences of opinion, however noisy an intense, were really rather slight. One thing all Frenchmen agreed upo n ' \"It must not happen again.\" Never again must the Hun be permitted to t> c ' come strong enough to assault France as in 1870 and in 1914. To preven this, the Right and the Left agreed, there were two methods: by tr,e collective action of all nations and bv France's own military power. Tn e two sides differed in the order in which these two should be used, tne Left wanting to use collective action first and France's own power a s a supplement or a substitute, the Right wanting to use France's own pow* first, with support from the League or other allies as a supplement. in addition, the Left tried to distinguish between the old imperial Gernw 11 ) and the new republican Germany, hoping to placate the latter a nd turn its mind away from revisionism by cooperative friendship and collect^' action. The Right, on the other hand, found it impossible to distingu^ 1 one Germany from another or even one German from another, beli eV \" ing that all were equally incapable of understanding any policy but force- Accordingly, the Right wanted to use force to compel Germany to riB* fill the Treaty of Versailles, even if France had to act alone. The policy of the Right was the policy of Poincare and Barthou; f policy of the Left was the policy of Briand.

Accordingly, France turned to a policy of the Left ( IQj 4„ 1929). In this period, which is known as the \"Period of Fulfillme 11 ' Briand, as foreign minister of France, and Stresemann, as foreign mi\" lS of Germany, cooperated in friendly terms. This period ended in i° : \"' not, as is usually said, because Stresemann died and Briand fell rr ° office, but because of a growing realization that the whole policy of * u fillment (1924-1929) had been based on a misunderstanding.

It was a relationship of cross-purposes, because the crucial issue (revision of Versailles) Briand stood adamant, like m Frenchmen, and Stresemann was irreconcilable, like most Germans. In France, as a result of the failure of the policy of the Right in '9* and of the policy of the Left in 1929, it became clear that France cou not act alone toward Germany. It became clear that France did not l lfl freedom of action in foreign affairs and was dependent on Britain f° r security.

This distinction w* so important that the history of the disarmament of land and air f° rceS can be divided into four periods: (a) a period of direct action, 1919-19 22 ' (b) a period of indirect action, 1922-1926; (c) a new period of dire ct action, 1926-1934; and (d) a period of rearmament, 1934—1939. The first period of direct action was based on the belief that the vic- tories of 1918 and the ensuing peace treaties provided security for th e victorious Powers. Accordingly, the task of reaching a disarmam eIlt agreement was turned over to a purely technical group, the Permanent Advisor) r Commission on Disarmament of the League of Nations. T\" lS group, which consisted exclusively of officers of the various arm 0 ' services, was unable to reach agreement on any important issues: lC could not find any method of measuring armaments or even of den 11 ' ing them; it could not distinguish actual from potential armaments 0 defensive from offensive. It gave answers to some of these questions, bu they did not win general assent. For example, it decided that rifles in {l1 possession of troops were war materials and so, also, were wood or st e capable of being used to make such rifles, but rifles already made and • storage were not war materials but \"inoffensive objects of peace.\" As a result of the failure of the Permanent Advisory Commissio\"' the Assembly of the League set up a Temporary Mixed Commas 1 dn which only six of twenty-eight members were officers of the arm services.

Before we turn to the background of these other problems, we shoo say a few words about the question of how much was paid in reps tions or if any reparations were ever paid at all. The question arose cause of a dispute regarding the value of the reparations paid before Dawes Plan of 1924. From 1924 to 1931 the Germans paid about 10.5 lion marks. For the period before 1924 the German estimate of rep- tions paid is 56,577 billion marks, while the Allied estimate is l0 *. billion. Since the German estimate covers everything that could p oSS1 •. be put in, including the value of the naval vessels they themselves scut in 1918, it cannot be accepted; a fair estimate would be about 30 b 1 marks for the period before 1924 or about 40 billion marks for reparaO as a whole. It is sometimes argued that the Germans really paid nothing reparations, since thev borrowed abroad just as much as thev e ver r. on reparations and that these loans were never paid. This is not q true, since the total of foreign loans was less than 19 billion fflW,, while the Allies' own estimate of total reparations paid was over :' , lion marks. However, it is quite true that after 19:4 Germany borro more than it paid in reparations, and thus the real payments on t obligations were all made before 1924. Moreover, the foreign loans w Germany borrowed could never have been made but for the exist e of the reparations system. Since these loans greatly strengthened many by rebuilding its industrial plant, the burden of reparations whole on Germany's economic system was very slight."},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"VII FINANCE, COMMERCIAL POLICY, AND BUSINESS ACTIVITY, 1897-1947"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"Reflation and Inflation, 1897-1925 The Period of Stabilization, 1922-1930 The Period of Deflation, 1927-1936 Reflation and Inflation, 1933-1947"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"Reflation and Inflation, 1897-1925 W E have already seen that valiant efforts were made in the period I 9 1 9~i929 to build up an international political order quite dif- ferent from that which had existed in the nineteenth century. n the basis of the old order of sovereignty and international law, men tempted, without complete conviction of purpose, to build a new in- e rnational order of collective security.

The Period of Stabilization, 1922-1930 their As soon as the war was finished, governments began to turn attention to the problem of restoring the prewar financial sy» he ta biliZ* old Since the essential element in that system was believed to be the g standard with its stable exchanges, this movement was called \"si* tion.\" Because of their eagerness to restore the prewar financial » tion, the \"experts\" closed their eyes to the tremendous changes * had resulted from the war. These changes were so great in produe in commerce, and in financial habits that any effort to restore prewar conditions or even stabilize on the gold standard was \"\"r sible and inadvisable. Instead of seeking a financial system adapts the new economic and commercial world which had emerged the war, the experts tried to ignore this world, and established a cial system which looked, superficially, as much like the prewa 1 \" tern as possible. This system, however, was not the prewar sj Neither was it adapted to the new economic conditions. When experts began to have vague glimmerings of this last fact, they dl 1 begin to modify their goals, but insisted on the same goals, and v * incantations and exhortations against the existing conditions made the attainment of their goals impossible.   f .  These changed economic conditions could not be controlled or * cised by incantations.

The basic economic organization of the world was modified in othe ways. As a result of the war, the old organization of relatively iree commerce among countries specializing in different types of produ c \" tion was replaced by a situation in which a larger number of country sought economic self-sufficiency by placing restrictions on commerc • In addition, productive capacity in both agriculture and industry ^ been increased by the artificial demand of the war period to a degr far beyond the ability of normal domestic demand to buy the produ of that capacity. And, finally, the more backward areas of Europe a the world had been industrialized to a great degree and were unwii J e to fall back to a position in which they would obtain industrial p r0 ucts from Britain, Germany, or the United States in return for f raw materials and food. This refusal was made more painful for sides by the fact that these backward areas had increased their outp 11 hlV of raw materials and food so greatly that the total could hardly been sold even if they had been willing to buy all their industrial p u A 1''' ucts from their prewar sources.

The result was a situation where all coun were eager to sell and reluctant to buy, and sought to achieve mutually irreconcilable ends by setting up subsidies and bountif exports, tariffs, and restrictions on imports, with disastrous resul world trade.

But none o these studies made any effort to assess the fundamental changes i\" economic, commercial, and political life since 1914. And none gave 3°) indication of a realization that a financial system must adapt itself t0 such changes. Instead, they all implied that if men w ould only g> ve up their evil ways and impose the financial system of 1914 on tn world, the changes would be compelled to reverse their direction a n go back to the conditions of 1914. Accordingly, the financial efforts of the period after 1918 became concentrated on a very simple (and superficial) goal—to get ^ aC the gold standard—not \"a\" gold standard but \"the\" gold standard, \"J which was meant the identical exchange ratios and gold contents t monetary units had had in 1914. Restoration of the gold standard was not something which could done by a mere act of government. It was admitted even by the ni ardent advocates of the gold standard that certain financial relaO 0 ships would require adjustment before the gold standard could restored. There were three chief relationships involved. These ^ v (1) the problem of inflation, or the relationship between money a goods; (2) the problem of public debts, or the relationship bet* governmental income and expenditure; and (3) the problem of P, parities, or the relationship between price levels of different countr That these three problems existed was evidence of a fundamental equilibrium between real wealth and claims on wealth, caused D> relative decrease in the former and increase in the latter. The problem of public debts arose from the fact that as m\". • (credit) was created during the war period, it was usually mad such a way that it was not in the control of the state or the comm u •, but was in the control of private financial institutions which derna n real wealth at some future date for the creation of claims on * e . in the present. The problem of public debt could have been met . one or more of several fashions: (a) by increasing the amount 01 wealth in the community so that its price would fall and the va , of money would rise. This would restore the old equilibrium v ^ price level) between real wealth and claims on wealth and, at same time, would permit payment of the public debt with no i ncr t in the tax rates; (b) by devaluation—that is, reduce the gold contend the monetary unit so that the government's holdings of gold woU |d worth a greatly increased number of monetary units. These » could be applied to the public debt; (c) by repudiation—that > s ' simple cancellation of the public debt by a refusal to pay it; (\"' ' g taxation—that is, bv increasing the tax rate to a level hi\"h cnoug , yield enough income to pav off the public debt; (e) bv the issuan 1 \" fiat money and the payment of the debt bv such money."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"FINANCE, COMMERCIAL POLICY, BUSINESS ACTIVITY 329 ihese methods were not mutually exclusive, and in some cases °jerlapped. It might, for example, be argued that devaluation or use \"at money were forms of partial repudiation. Nor were all these etn °ds equallv practical. For example, the first (increase real wealth) *as by f ar the soundest method to achieve a restabilization, but no ne saw how to accomplish it. The fourth (taxation) would have put burden on the economic system so great as to be self-defeating. In r itain, the public debt could have been paid only by a tax of 25 Percent for about three hundred years. Such heavy taxes might have . su ch a depressing effect on production of real wealth that national come would decline faster than tax rates rose, making payment by Ration impossible. Nor were all these alternative methods of paying e public debt of equal practicality in respect to their effects on the 0 other financial problems occupying the minds of experts and atesrnen. These other two problems were inflation and price parities. ese problems were just as urgent as the public debt, and the effects P°n them of the different methods for paying the public debt could Ve oeen completely different. Efforts to pay the public debt by at money would have made the inflation problem and perhaps the P lc 'e-parity problem worse. Taxation and increasing real wealth, m the other hand, would have reduced the inflation problem the same time as they reduced the public debt, since both would J^e increased the value of money (that is, they were deflationary). eir effects on the problem of price parity would differ from case inally, these methods of paying the public debt were not of equal Ue in theory. Orthodox theory rejected repudiation, devaluation, and money as solutions to the problem, and, since it showed no way ln creasing the production of real wealth, only taxation was left as a Possible method of paying public debts. But the theorists, as we have ° Wn . could call taxation a possible way only if they neglected the 0n omic consequences. These consequences in most countries were ° disastrous that taxation, if tried, soon had to be supplemented by t , r ' unorthodox, methods. Great Britain and the United States were e only Great Powers which continued to use taxation as the chief ethod of paying the public debt. 1 »e second problem which had to be faced before stabilization was Possible was the problem of inflation. This was caused by the great .^crease i n claims on wealth (money), and showed itself in a drastic cr ease in prices. There were three possible solutions: (a) to increase 0 e P r °duction of real wealth; (b) to decrease the quantity of money; ( c ) to devaluate, or make each unit of money equal to a smaller ^ount of wealth (specifically gold). The first two would have forced P ric es back to the lower prewar level but would have done it in en- re y different ways, one resulting in prosperity and a great rise in"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"33°  TRAGEDY AND HOPE standards of living, the second resulting in depression and a great fa\" in standards of living. The third method (devaluation) was essentially a recognition and acceptance of the existing situation, and would have left prices at the higher postwar level permanently. This would have involved a permanent reduction in the value of money, and also would have given different parities in foreign exchanges (unless there was i n ' ternational agreement that countries devaluate by the same ratio). B ut it would have made possible prosperitv and a rising standard of living and would have accepted as permanent the redistribution of wealth from creditors to debtors brought about by the wartime inflation. Since the third method (devaluation) was rejected by orthodo* theorists, and no one could see how to get the first (increase of re? wealth), onlv the second (deflation) was left as a possible method i° r dealing with the problem of inflation. To many people it seenie axiomatic that the cure for inflation was deflation, especially a nC bankers regarded deflation as a good thing in itself. Moreover, detia tion as a method for dealing with the problem of inflation went hand 1 hand with taxation as a method for dealing with the problem of P u J, debts. Theorists did not stop to think what the effects of both won be on the production of real wealth and on the prosperity of t world. The third financial problem which had to be solved before stabiW tion became practical was the problem of price parities. This differ^ because it was primarily an international question while the other n problems were primarily domestic. By suspending the gold standa and establishing artificial control of foreign exchanges at the outbre of war, the belligerent countries made it possible for prices to rise different rates in different countries. This can be seen in the fact t » prices in Britain rose 200 percent in seven years (1913-1920), M .... the United States they rose only 100 percent. The resulting disequii rium had to be rectified before the two countries went back on the gold standard, or the currencies would be valued in law in a ratio q u ™\" — —  — e -_, b — B —• „  .  ratios, one ounce of fine gold would, by law, become equal to 120.07 . !•' different from their value in goods.

Such Equilibrium of price parities could be adjusted either by a fall of r c es in the country whose currency was overvalued or by a rise in r c es m the country whose currency was undervalued (or by both). ctl an adjustment would be largely automatic, but at the cost of onsiderable flow of gold from the country whose currency was 0Ve rvalued. ecause the problem of price parities would either adjust itself or require international agreement for its adjustment, no real ntion was paid to it when governments turned their attention to task of stabilization.

At the same Dili. the policy was intended to drive British prices down to the level o world prices. The currency notes which had been used to suppl enieI bank notes were retired, and credit was curtailed by raising the « count rate to panic level. The results were horrible.

The outcome was a great wave of SPW and industrial unrest. The British government could measure the success of their dcflati only by comparing their price level with world price levels. This w* done by means of the exchange ratio between the pound and dollar. At that time the dollar was the only important currency gold. It was expected that the forcing down of prices in Britain wou be reflected in an increase in the value of the pound in terms of dol on the foreign exchange market. Thus as the pound rose gradua upward toward the pre-war rate of $4.86, this rise would measure fall in British prices downward to the American (or the world) p rl level. In general terms, this was true, but it failed to take into c° sideration the speculators who, knowing that the value of the p oU was rising, sold dollars to buy pounds, thus pushing the dollar do and the pound upward faster than was justified in terms of the C\" 8 * 1 ^ in price levels in the two countries.

In that six-year H 10 d it had reached as high as 142 (in 1925) and fallen as low as 134 1926). This stability in prices was accompanied by stability in n omic conditions.

By the midd the stage of financial capitalism, however, the organization of fina capitalism had evolved to a highly sophisticated level of security p r . tion and speculation which did not require any productive invest as a basis.

The result of this was that larger and larger aggregates of wealth fell into tn e control of smaller and smaller groups of men. While financial capitalism was thus weaving the intricate pattern ° modern corporation law and practice on one side, it was establish\"* monopolies and cartels on the other. Both helped to dig the grave ° financial capitalism and pass the reins of economic control on to t newer monopoly capitalism. On one side, the financiers freed the co trollers of business from the owners of business, but, on the other si > this concentration gave rise to monopoly conditions which freed controllers from the banks.    «    The date at which any country shifted to financial capitalism • later shifted to monopoly capitalism depended on the supply of cap available to business.

' countries sought to resist these factors, both old and new, by adopt'» political interference with economic life in the form of tariffs, Mip quotas, export subsidies, and so on. The financial maladjustments served to create an insufficiency of g , and a maldistribution of gold. The inadequacy of the supply 01 % , arose from several causes. It has been estimated that the world's stoc gold money needed to increase by 3.1 percent per year in the 1920 s , support the world's economic development with stable prices on the g standard. The production of new gold after 1920 was below this Moreover, as a result of the activities of the League of Nations financial advisers like Professor E. W. Kemmerer of Princeton versify, every country was encouraged to get on the gold stall This led to a \"gold rush\" as each country tried to obtain a supp') gold large enough to provide adequate reserves. Because there more countries on gold in 1928 than in 1914 and because prices m g eral were higher, more gold was needed in reserves.  j  The efforts to get around this by using a gold exchange stan rather than a gold standard were helpful in dealing with the p r ° , of inadequate supplies of gold but increased the difficulty of the p*^ lem of maldistribution of gold, since the gold exchange standar not respond to the flow of gold as readily and thus did not sei* v well to stem such flows of gold. The need for gold was made p ' , s by the existence of large floating balances of political or panic ^ which might well move from one market to another independen ^ economic conditions. The need was increased by the fact that m there were three major financial centers which had to make pa}' 1 ^ by shipments of gold in contrast to the single financial center or ^ where payments could be made by bookkeeping transactions. To r ^ this problem to some degree, the Bank for International Settleme n .. created in 1929 but never functioned as its founders had hoped. ^1 • the need for gold was increased by the enormous growth in i ,j indebtedness, much of it of a political nature such as the war deo reparations.     ^     On top of this insufficiency of gold was superimposed a drasn distribution of gold. This was conclusive proof that the financial sy 1 of 1914 had broken down, for the old system would have °P"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"FINANCE, COMMERCIAL POLICY, BUSINESS ACTIVITY 341 omatically to distribute gold evenly. This maldistribution resulted 1X1 the fact that when gold flowed into certain countries the auto- lc results of such a flow (such as rising prices or falling interest s ) which would have restored equilibrium in 1914 were prevented 1? act * n g in 1928. In this period, about four-fifths of the world's I su Pply was in five countries, and over half was in two, the United s an d France. The gold had been brought to these two for quite e .rent reasons—to the United States because it was the world's greatest itor and to France because of its devaluation of the franc. Britain, , le other hand, had floating balances of about ,£8oo million, and e d each year ,£20,000 million in transactions with a gold reserve ot only £ 150 million. Such a situation made it possible for France to use ° a s a political weapon against Britain. s a result of these conditions and the deflationary economic condi- s described in Chapter 11, prices began to fall, at first slowly and • Wltn increasing rapidity.

Early in 1929, the board of governors of the Federal Reserve SysB became alarmed at the stock-market speculation, especially at its drai ing credit from industrial production. To curtail this, in April 1929- Federal Reserve authorities called upon the member banks to red u A in their loans on stock-exchange collateral. At the same time, it engage 0 open-market operations which reduced its holdings of bankers' accep ances from about $300 million to about $150 million. The steriliz* 0 of gold was made more drastic. It was hoped in this way to re , the amount of credit available for speculation. Instead, the ava» fl credit went more and more to speculation and decreasingly to pr oCl tive business.

Various physical and extralegal restrictions were placed on export of gold (su c \" as issuing gold bars of a low purity unacceptable to the Bank of France)' The outflow of gold could not be stopped. It amounted to £ 2 in two months. On September 18th New York and Paris refused further credits to the British Treasury, and three days later the gold standard was suspended. The bank rate still stood at 4'/ 2 percent. To many ex- perts the most significant aspect of the event was not that Britain went off gold, but that she did so with the bank rate at 4/2 percent. It \"3 always been said in Britain that a 10 percent bank rate would pull go' out of the earth.

The pound sterling appreciated in respect to the do ' from 3.27 on December 1, 1931, to 3.80 on March 31, 1932.

It 1S a futile task. From the point of view of narrow self-interest in the short run, all countries were correct in their actions. From the wider p oin of view of the world as a whole or of the long-run results, all countries were worthy of blame. By 1933, the day in which any country coul follow a policy of short-run self-interest and remain under liberal capi- talism was past.

In the Netherlands and in the countries eastern Europe, the chief problem was \"segmentation of prices\" (that > hat prices of food and raw materials, which they sold, fell faster than r lc es of manufactured goods which they bought). . a result of the crisis, regardless of the nature of its primary impact, countries began to pursue policies of economic nationalism.

The blow which forced the change was the British tariff on iron and established on March 26, 1935.

In some cases, in order reduce outstanding debts, it made agreements to curtail exports tr° Britain or to reduce quotas on such goods (Anglo-Italian agreements April 1936, of November 1936, and of March 1938, as amended M afC 1939).

Even with clearings and stricted exports Britain had great difficulty in bringing into existence unfavorable balance of trade with debtor countries.

As a r es ' payments continued to lag behind (two and a half years in respe c Turkev), and it was necessary to rewrite the commercial agreei' 1 embodying the new bilateralism (in the case of Italy, four agreements^ three years).

Price controls and rationing were better applied and more strictly enforced. Surpluses of money were taken up by new techniques of compulsory or voluntary savings. The financing of the war was more skillful so that a much larger increase m production was obtained from a similar degree of inflation. .Much of the improvement in financing World War II in comparison with World War I arose from the fact that attention was concentrated on real resources rather than on monev. This was reflected both in the way in which each country managed its domestic economy and in the rela- tionships between countries. The latter can be seen in the use of Lena- Lease rather than commercial exchange as in World War I to provide America's allies with combat supplies. The use of commercial exchange and orthodox financing in the First World War had left a terrible burden of intergovernmental debts and ill-feeling in the postwar period. In World War II the United States provided Great Britain under Lend' Lease with $27,000 million in supplies, received $6,000 million in return, and wrote off the account with a payment of about $800 million in t\" postwar settlement. In domestic economies even more revolutionary techniques were veloped under the general category of centralized planning. This wen much further in Great Britain than in the United States or German}. and was chiefly remarkable for the fac<: that it applied to real resource and not to monev flows. The chief of these controls were over ma power and materials. Both of these were allotted where they seenie to be needed, and were not permitted, as in World War I, to be dra w here and there in response to rising wages or prices. Rises in prices we controlled by sopping up excess purchasing power by compulsory semicompulsory saving and by rationing of specific necessities. A\" 0 ^ all, price rises in such necessities were prevented by subsidies to produ ers, which gave them more payment for production without any mere in the final selling price. As a result, in Britain the cost of living rose fro ^ 100 in 1939 to 126 in 1941, but rose no more than to 129 by the wa end in 1945. In the United States wholesale prices of all commodities ro only 26 percent from 1940 to 1945. but were twice as high as in io4° , 1947.

The simplest way to destroy the state, they felt, would be to ass assinate the chief of the state; this would act as a spark to ignite a v holesale uprising of oppressed humanity against all forms of coercive power. These views led to numerous assassinations of various political waders, including a king of Italy and a president of the United States, in tlle period 1895-1905. Syndicalism was a somewhat more realistic and later version of n archism. It was equally determined to abolish all public authority, but did not rely on the innate goodness of individuals for the continuance social life. Rather it aimed to replace public authority by volun- ty associations of individuals to supply the companionship and man- gerrierit of social life which, according to these thinkers, the state had signally failed to provide. The chief of such voluntary associations P'acing the state would be labor unions. According to the syndicalists, e state was to be destroyed, not by the assassination of individual heads states, but by a general strike of the workers organized in labor 1Q ns. Such a strike would give the workers a powerful esprit de corps on a sense of their power and solidarity. By making all forms of • rcior i impossible, the general strike would destroy the state and replace y a flexible federation of free associations of workers (syndicates). narchism's most vigorous proponent was the Russian exile Michael ir if 0111 ('^H - '^). His doctrines had considerable appeal in Russia 1 but in western Europe they were widely accepted only in Spain, P cially Barcelona, and in parts of Italy where economic and psvcho- & cal conditions were somewhat similar to those in Russia.

The rivalries of the two groups ultimately disrupted the Second International as well as the labor movement as a whole, so that antilabor regimes were able to come to power in much of Europe in the period 1918-1939- This disruption and failure of the working-class movement is one of the cruet factors in European history in the twentieth century and, accordingly! requires at least a brief survey of its nature and background. The ideas of Karl Marx (181S-1883) and of his associate Friedricn Engels (1820-1895) were published in the Communist Manifesto or 1848 and in their three-volume opus, Das Kapital (1867-1894). Although they were aroused by the deplorable conditions of the European working classes under industrialism, the chief sources of the ideas themselves wei • to be found in the idealism of Hegel, the materialism of the ancient Gree atomists (especially Democritus), and the theories of the English classi- cal economists (especially Ricardo). Marx derived from Hegel what ha come to be known as the \"historical dialectic.\" This theory maintaine that all historical events were the result of a struggle between opposi' g forces which ultimately merged to create a situation which was difrere from either. Any existing organization of society or of ideas (tbest/ calls forth, in time, an opposition (antithesis). These two struggle vW each other and give rise to the events of history, until finally the two tu into a new organization (synthesis). This synthesis in turn becomes esta lished as a new thesis to a new opposition or antithesis, and the strugg continues, as history continues.    ,    A chief element in Marxist theory was the economic interpretation history. According to this view, the economic organization of any soci J was the basic aspect of that society, since all other aspects, such as p° cal, social, intellectual, or religious, reflected the organization and p oV of the economic level. From Ricardo, Marx derived the theory that the value of ec ° n0lt !- s goods was based on the amount of labor put into them. Applying idea to industrial society where labor obtains wages which reflect 0 part of the value of the product thev are making, Marx decided labor was being exploited. Such exploitation was possible, he belie ; because the working classes did not own the \"instruments of product)' (that is, factories, land, and tools) but had allowed these, by e &' chicanery, to fall into the hands of the possessing classes. In this ^ '• the capitalistic system of production had divided society into two a thetical classes: the bourgeoisie who owned the instruments of produc and the proletariat who lived from selling their labor. The proletflr however, were robbed of part of their product by the fact that wages represented only a portion of the value of their labor, the su y value\" of which thev were deprived going to the bourgeoisie as p r , The bourgeoisie were able to maintain this exploitative system \" e"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"INTERNATIONAL SOCIALISM  379  th e economic, social, intellectual, and religious portions of society re- flected the exploitative nature of the economic system. The money which tfl e bourgeoisie took from the proletariat in the economic system made it Possible for them to dominate the political system (including the police an Q the army), the social system (including family life and education), as Well as the religious system and the intellectual aspects of society (in- udbg the arts, literature, philosophy, and all the avenues of pub- llci ty for these). Prom these three concepts of the historical dialectic, economic de- terminism, and the labor theory of value, Marx built up a complicated theory 0 f past and future history. He believed that \"all history is the history 0 f c j ass struggles.\" Just as in antiquity, history was concerned ) Vlt h the struggles of free men and slaves or of plebians and patricians, so, ln tri e Middle Ages, it was concerned with the struggles of serfs and lords, ^ n o> in modern times, with the struggles of proletariat and bourgeoisie, tach privileged group arises from opposition to an earlier privileged S r °up, plays its necessary role in historical progress, and is, in time, successfully challenged by those it has been exploiting. Thus the ourgeoisie rose from exploited serfs to challenge successfully the older privileged group of feudal lords and moved into a period of bourgeois su premacy in which it contributed to history a fully capitalized industrial society but will be challenged, in its turn, by the rising power of the 'Coring masses.

Marx had missed the real essence of the Industrial Revo- 1Q n.

The rea ] essence of industrialism was to be found !e application of nonhuman energy, such as that from coal, oil, or erpower, to production. This process increased man's ability to \" e goods, and did so to an amazing degree. But mass production exist only if it were followed by mass consumption and rising ards of living. Moreover, it must lead, in the long run, to a de- asing demand for hand labor and an increasing demand for highly • nec * technicians who are managers rather than laborers. And, in longer run, this process would give rise to a productive system of a high level of technical complexity that it could no longer be D y the owners but would have to be run by technically trained agers.

The influence of these last two groups on the state in an advanced industrial country also served to increase their ability to obtain what they wished from society as a whole. As a consequence of all these influences, the revolutionary spirit did not continue to advance with the advance of industrialism, as Marx had expected, but began to decrease, with the result that the more advanced industrial countries became less and less revolutionary. Moreover, wha revolutionary spirit did exist in advanced industrial countries was no to be found, as Marx had expected, among the laboring population but among the lower middle class (so-called \"petty bourgeoisie )• The average bank clerk, architect's draftsman, or schoolteacher wa unorganized, found himself oppressed by organized labor, monopolize industry, and the growing power of the state, and found himself caught in the spiral of rising costs resulting from the efforts of his three opp reS \" sors to push the costs of social welfare and steady profits on to tn unorganized consumer.

All of these things made planning of •\"easing significance in the productive process. Such planning made necessary to reduce the number of uncontrolled factors in the pro- ctive process to a minimum while seeking to control as manv of ese factors as possible. An industry which had hundreds of millions , dollars (or even billions) in equipment and plant, as did the steel ustry, automobiles, chemicals, or electrical utilities, had to be able plan, in advance, the rate and the amount of usage that equipment a receive. This need led to monopoly, which was, essentially, an , ort t0 control both prices and sales by removing competition from Market.

But if Wagner is correct, the situation was achieved only briefly. The shift of world trade from Mediterranean and Baltic to the Atlantic destroyed the trans-Germanic commercial basis of German municipal guild life—a fact which Thomas Mann still mourned in our own day. Almost immediately the spiritual unity of the Germans w' aS shattered bv the Protestant Reformation. When it became clear that no degree of violence could restore the old religious unity, the Germans in the settlement of Augsburg (1555), came up w ith a typically German solution: individuals would be saved from the painful need to make decision in religious belief by leaving the choice to the prince in eac principality. This solution and the almost contemporary reception of w Roman Law were significant indications of the process by which I German municipalism of the late medieval period was replaced by tn Germanv of principalities (Lander) of modern times. As a result of the loss of religious unity, the Germanies became divide into a Protestant northeast, increasingly dominated by the Hohenzolle rn of Brandenburg-Prussia, and a Catholic southwest, increasingly domino* by the Habsburgs of Austria.

Certainly they are not sufficie . binding to deserve the name of constitution. This is not to say tna constitution cannot be unwritten. It is perfectly possible to have unwritten constitution, but no constitution exists unless its unwfl practices are fairly clearly envisaged and are more binding than oral ; law. In Britain neither of these is true. There is no agreement even fairly clear-cut issues.

In practice, it has become a guarantee of little value. T\" e government can refuse to answer any question on the grounds of \"p uD \" he interest.\" To this decision there is no appeal. In addition, when ques- tions are not refused, they are frequently answered in an evasive fashion which provides no enlightenment whatever. This was the regular pro- cedure in answering questions on foreign policy in the period i935~ I0 4 0 ' In that period, questions were even answered by outright falsehoods w ltn \" out any possible redress available to the questioners. Violation and distortion of the \"conventions of the constitution\" nav steadily increased in the twentieth century. In 1921 a convention 0 over five hundred years' duration and another of over one hundre years' duration were set aside without a murmur. The former provide that the Convocations of the Church of England be simultaneous wi the sessions of Parliament. The latter provided that the Royal Adore be approved in council. Even more serious were the distortions of c0 ventions. In 1931 the convention that the leader of the opposition asked to form a government when the Cabinet resigns was serious y modified. In 1935 the rule regarding Cabinet solidarity was made me ingless. In 1937 the Conservative government even violated a consti tional convention with impunity by having George VI take the coronati oath in a form different from that provided by law. This process of the weakening and dissolution of the so-called \"cons tution\" went so far in the twentieth century that, by 1932, Sir Aus Chamberlain and Stanley (Lord) Baldwin were agreed that \" 'uncons national' is a term applied in politics to the other fellow who does so thing that you do not like.\" This statement is too sweeping by i ar ' , more accurate estimation of the situation would, perhaps, be w° r thus: \" 'Unconstitutional' is any action likely to lead to public disor in the immediate future or likely to affect adversely the governme chances at the polls in any future election.\"   ,  The kind of act which could lead to such a result would be, in first place, any open act of repression. More important, it woul in the second place, any open act of \"unfairness.\" This idea of u ness,\" or, on its positive side, \"fair play,\" is a concept which is largely Anglo-Saxon and which is largely based on the class stru of England as it existed up to the early twentieth century. This structure was clearly envisioned in the minds of Englishmen ana so completely accepted that it was assumed without need to be exp stated. In this structure, Britain was regarded as divided into two g , the \"classes\" and the \"masses.\" The \"classes\" were the ones who leisure. This meant that they had property and income.

These were (a) education must not be voca- n al—that is, aimed at assisting one to make living; (b) education is aimed directly at creating or training the intelligence; and (c) edu- 10r > is not aimed at finding the \"Truth.\" On its positive side, the Y em of education of the \"classes\" displayed its real nature on the 00 ' ev el rather than on the university level. It aimed at developing or al outlook, a respect for traditions, qualities of leadership and Peration, and above all, perhaps, that ability for cooperation in com- P etm on summed up in the English idea of \"sport\" and \"playing the 8 ie.

As we have seen, this influence of the Bank of England r the government was an almost unmitigated disaster for Britain. e power of the bank in business circles was never as complete as as in government, because British businesses remained self-financing a greater extent than those of other countries. This self-financing r e r of business in Britain depended on the advantage which it held ause of the early arrival of industrialism in England. As other coun- tries h - occaine industrialized, reducing Britain's advantage and her extraor- r y profits, British business was forced to seek outside financial aid or educe its creation of capital plant. Both methods were used, with result that financial capitalism grew at the same time as considerable ions of Britain's capital plant became obsolete, e control of the Bank of England over business was exercised in- V through the joint-stock banks. These banks became increasingly grated and increasingly powerful in the twentieth century. The lg er °f such banks decreased through amalgamation from 109 in • R to 35 in 1919 and to 33 in 1933. This growth of a \"money trust\" ntain led to an investigation by a Treasury Committee on Bank gamations.

A bill was th K \"^ t0 P revent further concentration but was withdrawn when for f ers ma de a \"gentlemen's agreement\" to ask Treasury permission ture amalgamations.

Although monopoly capitalism began to grow in Britain as far back as the British Salt Union of 1888 (which controlled 91 percent of the British supply), the victory of monopoly capitalism over finance capitalism did not arrive until 1931. By that year the structure of m°' nopoly capitalism was well organized. The Board of Trade report* in 1918 that Britain had 500 restrictive trade associations. In that sam year the Federation of British Industries (FBI) had as members i*9 trade associations and 704 firms. It announced that its goals would the regulation of prices, the curtailment of competition, and the foste ing of cooperation in technical matters, in politics, and in publicity- / 1935 it had extended this scope to include (a) elimination of cSC , productive capacity, (b) restrictions on entry of new firms into a nc ' and (c) increasing duress on both members and outsiders to obey m mum-price regulations and production quotas. This last ability w steadily strengthened in the period 1931-1940. Probably the g reat , achievement in this direction was a decision of the House of ^° ' acting as a Supreme Court, which permitted the use of duress ag*\" outsiders in order to enforce restrictive economic agreements (the of Thorne v. Motor Trade Association decided June 4, 1937)- The year 1931 represented for Britain the turning point from « , cial to monopoly capitalism. In that year financial capitalism, * , had held the British economy in semidepression for a decade, acW its last great victory when the financiers led by Montagu Norman J. P.

Monopoly had aire grown to such a degree that it aspired to make the banking syste servant instead of its master. The deflationary financial policy ° •_ bankers had alienated politicians and industrialists and driven nopolist trade unions to form a united front against the bankers. This was clearly evident in the Conference on Industrial Reorga tion and Relationships of April 1928. This meeting contained r sentatives of the Trade Union Congress and the Employers' Feden and issued a Memorandum to the chancellor of the Exchequer sg by Sir Alfred Mond of Imperial Chemicals and Ben Turner o trade unions. Similar declarations were issued by other rnon /i: st s groups, but the split of monopolist capitalists and of financial cap ' could not become overt until the latter were able to get rid or bour government.

X( le 0 j^ niono p 0 ]ies and cartels increased in strength and new 0ncs xv ere formed, usually with the blessing of the government. These S ro \"ps enforced restrictive practices on their members and on outsiders ^ cn to the extent of buying up and destroying productive capacity in leir 0w n lines. In some cases, as in agricultural products and in coal, lese e fforts were based on statute law, but in most cases they were F rely private ventures.

In 1942 a capable ob- tver, Hermann Levy, wrote, \"Today Britain is the only highly in- strialized country in the world where no attempt has yet been made restrict the domination of quasi-monopolist associations in industry trade.\" It is true that the government did not accept the suggestions Lord Melchett and of the Federation of British Industries that cartels trade associations be made compulsory, but it gave such free rein lese groups in the use of their economic power that the compulsory i Ir- ecame largely unnecessary.

In spite of the g r()Win » international crisis, these restrictive actions continued unabated un May 1940, but the drive toward total mobilization by the Church' government brought a fuller utilization of resources in Britain than 1 any other country. This wartime experience with full employment made it impossible return to the semistagnation and partial use of resources which ha prevailed under financial capitalism in the 1930's. However, the ec nomic future of Britain in the postwar period was much hampered the fact that the two opposing political parties represented entrencne economic interests and were not a rather amorphous groupings diverse interests as in the United States. The Labour Party, wl11 held office from 1945 to 1951 under Clement Attlee, represents the 1 terests of labor unions and, in a more remote fashion, of consume The Conservative Party, which held office under Churchill, Eden, * la millan, and Douglas-Home after 1951 represents the propertied class . and still continues to show strong banking influence. This has created a kind of balance in which a welfare state has been established, bu the cost of slow inflation and slack use of resources. Consumption and enjovment of leisure rather than production na been the marks of the British economy even under the Conserva Party, which has shown more concern for the value of the P oun ,, the foreign exchanges than it has for productive investment.

They are satisfied with an adequate return ° their money, but the possibility of such control exists. Another source of funds from lower-class sources is the Postal Saving system. This has expanded because the lower classes in England reg a banks as alien, upper-class institutions, and prefer to put their savi 0 somewhere else. As a result, Postal Savings at over £6,000 millions a' about the same size as the deposits of all the eleven joint-stock ban Somewhat similar in character are the investments of pension i UI ' which reached a total of about £ 2,000 million at the end of 196° a are increasing at about /150 million a year.

Unlike the situation in America, stocks bought on margin were considered to be the propert} of the bank (acting as stockbrokers) until the whole price has l> een paid. The importance of the stock-brokerage business to Cernia banks mav be seen in the fact that in the twenty-four years 1885-'°° one-quarter of the gross profits of the large credit banks came n\" 011 commissions. This is all the more remarkable when we consider t the brokerage commissions charged by German banks were very $3 (sometimes as low as one-half per thousand). Bv methods such as these, a highly centralized financial capital's' 1 was built up in Germany. The period begins with the founding or t Darmstadter Bank in 1853. This was the first bank to establish a perma- nent, systematic control of the corporations it floated. It also was t first to use promotion syndicates (in 1859). Other banks followed n example, and the outburst of promotion reached a peak of activity a\" corruption in the four years 1870-1874. In these four years, 857 stoc companies with 3,306,810,000 marks of assets were floated, compare to 295 companies with 2,405,000,000 in assets in the preceeding nine teen years (1851-1870). Of these 857 companies founded in I870~I 8 74> 123 were in the process of liquidation and 37 were bankrupt as eary as September 1874. These excesses of financial capitalist promotion led to a governinen investigation which resulted in a strict law regulating promotion in '° '' This law made it impossible for German bankers to make fortunes out promotion and made it necessary for them to seek the same ends -. consolidating their control of industrial corporations on a long-t er basis. This was quite different from the United States, where the a sense of any legal regulation of promotion previous to the SEC Act 1933 made it more likely that investment bankers would seek to ma from the control of industrial companies.

The weak- es s of the former was based on the fact that the other banks rarely anie to the Reichsbank for rediscounts, and usually had a discount rate °w that of the Reichsbank. A law of 1899 tried to overcome this eakness by forcing the other banks to adjust their discount rates to at of the Reichsbank, but it was never a very effective instrument of itrol. Open-market control was also weak because of an official rman reluctance \"to speculate\" in government securities and be- s e the other banks were more responsive to the condition of their r Wolios of commercial paper and securities than they were to the e of their gold reserves. In this thev were like French rather than 'sn banks. Only in 1909 did the Reichsbank begin a deliberate policy control through open-market operations, and it was never effective. M 'as ended completely from 1914 to 1929 by the war, the inflation, and the restrictions of the Dawes Plan. ecause of these weaknesses of the Reichsbank, the control of Ger- nnancial capitalism rested in the credit banks.

The attempt (and failure) of Stinnes to turn this structure 01 financial controls into an integrated monopoly marks the end of finan- cial capitalism in Germany. To be sure, the great need for capital on the part of German industry in the period after 1924 (since so much of German savings was wip e out by the inflation) gave a false afterglow to the setting sun of «e man financial capitalism. In five years, billions of marks were supp 1 ^ to German industry through financial channels from loans made outsi Germany- But the depression of 1929 to 1934 revealed the falsity this appearance. As a result of the depression, all the Great Banks one had to be rescued by the German government, which took oS their capital stock in return. In 1937 these banks that had come un government ownership were \"reprivatized,\" but by that time indus J had largely escaped from financial control. The beginnings of monopoly capitalism in Germany goes back least a generation before the First World War. As early as ^7°' . financial capitalists, using direct financial pressure as well as t system of interlocking directors, were working to integrate enterpn and reduce competition. In the older lines of activity, such as c ' iron, and steel, they tended to use cartels. In the newer lines, electrical supplies and chemicals, they tended to use great monopo 1 firms for this purpose. There are no official figures on cartels pe 1905 but it is believed that there were 250 cartels in 1896, of wnic were in iron and steel. The official investigation of cartels made by Rv.chstag in 1905 revealed 385, of which 92 were in coal and me Shortly after this, the government began to help these cartels, the famous example of this being a law of 1910 which forced potash rn facturers to become members of the potash cartel.  _ c In 1923 there were 1,500 cartels, according to the Federatio German Industrialists. They were, as we have seen, given a sp legal status and a special court the following year. By the time o financial collapse of 1931 there were 2,500 cartels, and mon y capitalism had grown to such an extent that it was prepared to over complete control of the German economic system. As the fell under government control, private control of the economic sy ,^ was assured by releasing it from its subservience to the banks, was achieved by legislation such as that curtailing interlocking air - c ates and the new corporation law of 1937, but above all by the eco fact that the growth of large enterprises and of cartels had put i n , in a position where it was able to finance itself without seeking from the banks.    . • j^ This new privately managed monopoly capitalism was organ 1 an intricate hierarchy whose details could be unraveled only by ^ time of study.

In addi- n > there was a very considerable amount of interlocking directorates a ownership by one corporation of the capital stock of another. al V, cartels working between corporations fixed prices, markets, and Put quotas for all important industrial products. An example of this— D y any means the worst—could be found in the German coal in- r y m 1937. There were 260 mining companies. Of the total output, companies had 90 percent, 5 had 50 percent, and 1 had 14 percent. ese mines were organized into five cartels of which 1 controlled 81 r cent of the output, and 2 controlled 94 percent.

This difference in attitude between German and other capitalists be- came increasingly evident in the 1930's. In that decade the German found his economic and his patriotic motives impelling him in the same direction (to build up the power and wealth of Germany against Russia and the West). The capitalists of France, Britain, and the United States, on the other hand, frequently experienced conflicting motives. Bolshevism presented itself as an economic threat to themselves at the same time tna Nazism presented itself as a political threat to their countries. Many persons were willing to neglect or even increase the latter threat 1 order to use it against the former danger. This difference in attitude between German and other capitalists aro from many causes. Among these were (a) the contrast between the C»e man tradition of a national economy and the Western tradition 0 laissez-faire, (b) the fact that world depression caused the threat social revolution to appear before Nazism rose as a political danger to t West, (c) the fact that cosmopolitan financial capitalism was replay more rapidly by nationalist monopoly capitalism in Germany than in West, and (d) the fact that many wealthy and influential persons » Montagu Norman, Ivar Kreuger, Basil Zaharoff, and Henri Deterdmg directed public attention to the danger of Bolshevism while maintaini g a neutral, or favorable, attitude toward Nazism. The impact of the war on Germany was quite different from 1\" effects on most other countries. In France, Britain, and the United ota the war played a significant role in demonstrating conclusively that e nomic stagnation and underemployment of resources were not necess y and could be avoided if the financial system were subordinated to economic system. In Germany this was not necessary, since the ^ a had already made this discovery in the 1930's. On the other hand, destruction of the war left Germany with a large task to do, the building of the German industrial plant.

It was the advent of the railroad ln th e period 1830-1870 which changed this situation. The railroads ^quired capital far beyond the ability of any private banker to supply r °m his own resources.

Control of savings banks and insurance con 1 panies was also shared, especially where they had been founded beto the two blocs achieved their modern form.

This cooperation between the two blocs in regard to the lower Ie v of the banking system (and the Bank of France itself) did not usua extend to industrial or commercial activity. There, competition outs the market was severe, and became a struggle to the death in '93- 1940. In some activities, spheres of interest were drawn between two groups, and thus competition was reduced.

Bv the twentieth century, Comite des Forges consisted of representatives of over 200 companies « nominal capital of about 8 billion francs, but whose securities were wo almost 100 billion francs in 1939.

Eleven corporations with 506 million francs of C»P tal were in the Paribas bloc. Eight firms with 749 million francs or c p tal were in neither bloc or doubtful.   ,   A somewhat similar development is to be found in the French industry. This, perhaps, is not surprising, as the coal industry was larg - dominated by the same groups as the steel industry. By 1938, 77 P cent of French coal production came from 14 companies. Three or t companies were owned by Wendel, who thus controlled 15.3 percen French coal output directly, and considerably more indirectly- \" ar to the Comite des Forges in steel, and controlled by the same group, the Comite-centrale des Houilleres in coal. This was supported by r > • on collieries based on output. Voting power within the organization based on this financial contribution, so that 13 companies controlled three-fourths of the votes and Wendel over one-sixth.

This Lille-Lyons Axis was built up about four economic activit' electrical utilities, chemicals, artificial textiles, and light metals, A\" four were monopolistic and interrelated, chiefly for technological r sons. They were monopolistic either by nature (public utilities; because they were based on narrowly controlled natural resou (utilities and chemicals), or because they required large-scale opera utilizing by-products and affiliated activities for profitable opera (utilities, chemicals, artificial textiles, and light metals), or because . required use of closely held patents (chemicals, artificial textiles, light metals).     , ,- c These activities were interrelated for various reasons. The p l utilities of the north were based on coal, while those of the souti were based on waterpower. The manufacture of light metals con trated in the southeast because of the available water power. . metals, chiefly aluminum, were made by electrolysis, which pro^ chemical by-products.

At- the same time, the Lille-Lyons Axis strengthened itself. The retlCn chemical industry, already largely monopolized by Etablisse- ^ nts Kuhlmann, was forced into a single corporation (Societe Fran- color) controlled by the Lille-Lyons Axis and I. G. Farben. The light- e tals industry, already largely monopolized by Alais, Froges, et reargue, was centralized almost completely in this firm. The artificial xtl| e industry, already largely monopolized by the Gillet clique, was tralized under a single corporation, France-Rayonne, under joint et-German control. The automobile industry was subjected to a ,6 e control—the Comite d'organization d'automobiles—and set up a manufacturing company—Societe generate franchise de construe- in au tomobiles.

' ' r °m the beginning, the United States had a shortage of labor in the lah 3n un P rece dented richness of resources. As a result, it sought -saving devices and high output per man-day of work, even in uiture. This means that the amount of capital equipment per man unusually high throughout American history, even in the earliest ' an d this undoubtedly presented a problem in an undeveloped r y where private savings were, for many generations, scarce.

Morgan and Rockefeller together it quentlv dominated the national Republican Party, while Morgan 0 casionallv had extensive influence in the national Democratic lar. (three of the Morgan partners were usually Democrats). These n were also powerful on the state level, especially Morgan in New i° and Rockefeller in Ohio. Mellon was a power in Pennsylvania an du Pont was obviously a political power in Delaware. In the 1920's this system of economic and political power forme hierarchy headed by the Morgan interests and played a principal both in political and business life. Morgan, operating on the inter tional level in cooperation with his allies abroad, especially in Eng a • influenced the events of history to a degree which cannot be sped in detail but which certainly was tremendous. Nevertheless, the s developments of business life which we have mentioned were ma e investment bankers like Morgan obsolete, and the deflationary nna policies on which these bankers insisted were laying the foundations the economic collapse which ended their rule in general social disa by 1940. In the United States, however, the demise of financial capitalism much more protracted than in most foreign countries, and was followed by a clearlv established system of monopoly capitalism- blurring of the stages was caused by a number of events of which t the centralized condition of the United States itself, especially the political system; and (3) the long-sustained political and legal tradi of antimonopoly going back at least to the Sherman Antitrust Act 1890. As a consequence, the United States did not reach a clearly n nopolistic economy, and was unable to adopt a fully unorthodox »n cial policy capable of providing full use of resources.

The deflationary policies of the niters were acceptable to heavy industrv chieflv because the mass or of heavy industry in the United States, notably in steel and auto- 0 \"e manufacturing, was not unionized, and the slowly declining r ces of the products of heavy industry could continue to be pro- ced profitably if costs could be reduced by large-scale elimination of or by installing more heavy equipment. Much of this new equip- t> which led to assembly-line techniques such as the continuous- 'P steel mill, were financed bv the bankers. With unorganized labor, employers of mass labor could rearrange, curtail, or terminate labor lout notice on a daily basis and could thus reduce labor costs to et falls in prices from bankers' deflation. The fact that reductions in 5 es or large layoffs in mass-employment industries also reduced the me of purchasing power in the economy as a whole, to the injury ner groups selling consumers' goods, was ignored by the makers of eav > r producers' goods. In this way, farmers, light industry, real estate, tl ^ ercia l g rou ps, and other segments of the society 7 were injured by eflationary policies of the bankers and by the employment poli- or neavy industry, closely allied to the bankers. When these policies arne unbearable in the depression of 1929—1933, these other interest cs , who had been traditionally Republican (or at least, like the la 1°* mers ' had refused to vote Democratic and had engaged in vvh 1^ ^ Ut ^ e tmr ^\"P art y movements), deserted the Republican Party, en remained subservient to high finance and heavy industry. tal l ' S S °^ t ' ie f arm hloc, light industry, commercial interests (no- sk-'Il P artm ent stores), real estate, professional people, and mass, un- of p tahor to the Democratic Party in 1932 resulted in the election franklin D.

The whole- sale manipulation of labor by heavy industry was curtailed by ^ National Labor Relations Act of 1933, which sought to protect labors rights of collective bargaining. At the same time, with the blessings ° the new administration, a drive was made by labor groups allied Wtf it to unionize the masses of unskilled labor employed by heavy industry to prevent the latter from adopting any policy of mass layoffs or sharp and sudden wage reductions in any future period of decreasing de ' mand. To this end a Committee for Industrial Organization was si up under the leadership of the one head of a mass labor union in f country, John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers, and a drive * 3 put on to organize the workers of the steel, automobile, electrical, an other industries which had no unions. All this served to create more highly organized and more self- c0 scious interest blocs in American life, especially among farmers a labor, but it did not represent any victory for unorthodox financing' the real key to either monopoly capitalism or to a managed pl ura economy. The reason for this was that the New Deal, because President Roosevelt, was fundamentally orthodox in its ideas on t nature of money. Roosevelt was quite willing to unbalance the buug and to spend in a depression in an unorthodox fashion because lie grasped the idea that lack of purchasing power was the cause 01 lack of demand which made unsold goods and unemployment, but had no idea of the causes of the depression and had quite ortho ideas on the nature of money. As a result, his administration trea the symptoms rather than the causes of the depression and, w spending unorthodoxly to treat these symptoms, did so with mo $ borrowed from the banks in the accepted fashion. The New Dea lowed the bankers to create the money, borrowed it from the banks, spent it. This meant that the New Deal ran up the national debt to credit of the banks, and spent money in such a limited fashion tha drastic reemployment of idle resources was possible. One of the most significant facts about the New Deal was its or doxy on money. For the whole twelve years he was in the vv House, Roosevelt had statutory power to issue fiat money in the r ( •• of greenbacks printed by the government without recourse to banks. This authority was never used. As a result of such orthou •..' the depression's symptoms of idle resources were overcome only _ the emergency of the war in 1942 made it possible to justify a l' 1111 increase in the national debt by limitless borrowing from private p e • and the banks.

This failure can be Seen in Roosevelt's theory of \"pump priming.\" He sincerely believed, as d 'd his secretary of the Treasury, that there was nothing structurally rotig W ith the economy, that it was simply temporarily stalled, and *ould keep going of its own powers if it could be restarted. In order to ^start it, a n that was neet } e d, in New Deal theory, was a relatively erate amount of government spending on a temporary basis. This • ^ create purchasing power (demand) for consumers' goods, which, turn, would increase the confidence of investors who would begin release large unused savings into investment. This would, again, create tional purchasing power and demand, and the economic system °uld take off of its own power.

A rise in the general or average standard of living in moder times is obvious and, with intermittent breaks, goes back for a t' 10 sand years. Such progress is welcome, but it obviously brings witn certain accompanying factors which must be understood and accep ted. olve A rising standard of living, except in its earliest stages, does not inv° any increase in consumption of necessities but instead involves an crease in the consumption of luxuries even to the point of replacing D ^ s necessities by luxuries. As average incomes rise, people do not, a a certain level, eat more and more black bread, potatoes, and cabbag 1 or wear more and more clothing. Instead, they replace black brea with wheaten bread and add meat to their diet and replace coar , clothing by finer apparel; they shift their emphasis from energy i°° to protective foods. This process can be continued indefinitely. A number of stude have divided goods from this point of view into three levels: (a) neC sities, (b) industrial products, and (c) luxuries and services. The would include food and clothing; the second would include railroa automobiles, and radios; the third would include movies, books, aniu ments, yachts, leisure, music, philosophy, and so on. Naturally* dividing lines between the three groups are very vague, and the posit 1 of any particular item will vary from society to society and even tto person to person.    ,     As standards of living rise, decreasing proportions of attention a resources are devoted to primary or secondary types of products, a increasing proportions to secondary and tertiary types of produc This has very important economic consequences. It means that luxur tend to become relatively more important than necessities. It a . means that attention is constantly being shifted from products for WW the demand is relatively inelastic to products for which the demand relatively elastic (that is, expansible). There are exceptions to tins, r example, housing, which is obviously a necessity, is a product which demand is fairly elastic and might continue to be so until n 1 persons lived in palaces, but, on the whole, the demand for necessiti is less elastic than the demand for luxuries."},{"pageNumber":552,"pageContent":"CHANGING ECONOMIC PATTERNS  537  A rising standard of living also means an increase in savings (or c cumulation of surplus) out of all proportion to the rise in incomes. | s a fairly general rule both for societies and for individuals that avings go up faster than incomes as the latter rise, if for no other f ason than the fact that a person with an adequate supply of neces- ies will take time to make up his mind on which luxuries he will pend any increase in income, inally, a shift from primary to secondary production usually en- s a ver V great increase in capital investment, while a shift from sec- . ar y to tertiary production may not result in any increase in capital estment proportionately as great.

The so- ed Industrial Revolution began when the energy from coal, re- sed through a nonliving machine—the steam engine—became an Portant element in the productive process.

It was this increase in output per man-hour whid permitted the rise in standards of living and the increases in investmen associated with the process of industrialization. The Industrial Revolution did not reach all parts of Europe, or even all pans of any single country, at the same moment. In general, ' began in England late in the eighteenth century (about 177 6 ) an spread slowly eastward and southward across Europe, reaching Franc after 1830, Germany after 1850, Italy and Russia after 1890. This east- ward movement of industrialism had many significant results, amo o them the belief on the part of the newer countries that they were a < disadvantage in comparison with England because of the latter's nea start. This was untrue, for, from a strictly temporal point of V» •> these newer countries had an advantage over England, since tn newer industrial installations were less obsolescent and less hamper by vested interests. Whatever advantage England had arose from b et natural resources, more plentiful supply of capital, and skilled ' a ' ' 3. The growth of size of enterprise was a natural result of the pr<> c of industrialism. This process required very considerable outlays fixed capital, especiallv in the activities most closely associated wiW early stages of industrialism, such as railroads, iron foundries, and tile mills. Such great outlays required a new legal structure for e prise. This was found in the corporation or limited-liability joint-s company. In this company large capital installations could be structed and run, with ownership divided into small fractions anio g large number of persons.    ~.    This increase in size of units was apparent in all countries, but CjU J in the United States, Britain, and Germany. The statistics on this incomplete and tricky to use, but, in general, they indicate that, . the number of corporations has been increasing, and the average si of all corporations has been falling, the absolute size of the la g corporations has been increasing rapidly in the twentieth century the share of total assets or of total output held by the largest corp tions has been rising.

As a result, by 1930 these 200 largest corporations had 49.2 Percent of all corporate assets (or $81 billion out of $165 billion); they hacJ 38 percent of all business wealth (or $81 billion out of $212 billion); tl | e y held 22 percent of all wealth in the country (or $81 billion out of $367 bill; on). In fact, in 1930, a single corporation (American Tele- Phone and Telegraph) had greater assets than the total wealth in 21 at es. No such figures are available for European countries, but there n he no doubt that similar growth was taking place in most of them dur 'ng this period. 4- Dispersal of ownership of enterprise was a natural result of the & owth of size of enterprise, and was made possible by the corporate • oc * of organization. As corporations increased in size, it became an d less possible for any individual or small group to own any Portant fractions of their stocks. In most countries the number of ', Uri ty holders increased faster than the number of outstanding securi- • in the United States the former increased in numbers seven times ast a s the latter from 1900 to 1928. This was a greater spread than er countries, but elsewhere there was also a considerable spreading or corporate ownership. This was exactly contrary to the predic- j °t Karl Marx that the owners of industry would get fewer and Cr as well as richer and richer. 5- I he separation of ownership from control has already been 'oned. It was an inevitable counterpart of the advent of the cor- ' e form of business organization; indeed, the corporate form was L  t ' 1 ' s ver X purpose—that is, to mobilize the capital owned ha ^ P erso 'is into a single enterprise controlled by a few.

In the United States, for example, according to the National Industr Conference Board, the richest one-fifth of the population rece» 46.2 percent of the national income in 1910, 51.3 percent in ia 20 > 48.5 percent in 1937. In the same three years, the share of the poor one-fifth of the population fell from 8.3 percent to 5.4 percent to 3v percent. Thus the ratios between the portion obtained by the ric one-fifth and that obtained by the poorest one-fifth increased in 1 \" three years from 5.6 to 9.3 to 13.5. If, instead of one-fifths, we exarni the ratios between the percentage obtained by the richest one-te and that obtained by the poorest one-tenth, we find that in 19 10 . ratio was 10; in 1929 it was 21.7; and in 1937 it was 34.4. This me that the rich in the United States were getting richer relatively a probably absolutely while the poor were getting poorer both relati / and absolutely. This last is caused by the fact that the increase in real national income in the period 1910-1937 was not great enoug compensate for the decrease in percentage going to the poor or the increase in number of persons in that class."},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"CHANGING ECONOMIC PATTERNS  54I  As a result of such an increase in disparity in the distribution of tonal income, there will be a tendency for savings to rise and for isiimers' purchasing power to decline relative to each other. This is cause the savings of a community are largely made by the richer F sons in it, and savings increase out of all proportion as incomes rise. the other hand, the incomes of the poor class are devoted primarily , ex penditurcs for consumption. Thus, if it is correct that there is an reasing disparity in the distribution of the national income of a coun- • \"'' tner e will be a tendency for savings to rise and consumer purchas- fa power to decline relative to each other.

Thus, we see that the controversy which has rage\" in both Europe and America since 1932 between progressives and conserva- tives in regard to the causes of the lack of investment is an artificial one- The progressives, who insisted that the lack of investment was cause by lack of consumer purchasing power, were correct. But the c° servatives, who insisted that the lack of investment was caused by lack of confidence, were also correct. Each was looking at the oppo slte side of what is a single continuous cycle. This cycle runs roughly as follows: (a) purchasing power crca demand for goods; {b) demand for goods creates confidence in minds of investors; (c) confidence creates new investment; and ( / new investment creates purchasing power, which then creates denw > and so on. To cut this cycle at any point and to insist that the c) begins at that point is to falsify the situation. In the 1930's the prog sives concentrated attention on stage (a), while the conservatives c centrated attention on stage (c). The progressives, who sought to incre. purchasing power by some redistribution of the national income, doubtedly did increase purchasing power under stage (a), but t . lost purchasing power under stage (c) by reducing confidence or P tential investors. This decrease of confidence was especially notices in countries (like France and the United States) which were still deep'.v involved in the stage of financial capitalism.  ,.  It would appear that the economic factors alone affected the tribution of incomes in the direction of increasing disparity. *\" major country, however, Mere the economic factors alone allo\\ ve determine the issue.

This was revealed in the \"larket (the central mechanism of the economic system) as a result of a Native increase in savings in respect to investment.

Here, again, the reasons are numerous. In the rst P'ace, the shift in advanced industrial countries from secondary to ertiary production reduces the demand for heavy capital investment. In e second place, declining rates of population increase, and geographic expansion may adversely affect the demand for investment. In the third P ac e, the increasing disparity in the distribution of incomes, whether it is interacted by government action or not, has a tendency to reduce the ernand for investment capital. In the fourth place, the decrease in com- petition has served to reduce the amount of investment by making it Possible for the controllers of existing capital to maintain its value by \"rtaihng the investment of new capital which would make the existing a prtal less valuable. This last point may require additional explanation. n the past, investment was not only capital-creating but also capital- estro ying-that is, it made some existing capital worthless by making it . So ' e te. The creation by investment, for example, of shipyards for mak- g iron-hull steam vessels not only created this new capital but at the arne tirr ie destroyed the value of the existing yards equipped to make '°oden-hull sailing ships. In the past, new investment was made in only on e of two cases: (a) if an old investor believed that the new capital would yield sufficient profit to pay for itself and for the old investment now made 0 solete, or (b) if the new investor was completely free of the old one, 0 that the latter could do nothing to prevent the destruction of his fisting capital holdings by the new investor. Both of these two alterna- tes, in the twentieth century tended to become less likely (until 1950), le former by the decline in consumer purchasing power and the latter y the decrease in competition. . the way in which the relative decline of investment in respect to sav- ^gs results in economic crisis is not difficult to see. In the modern eco- 0lTllc community, the sum total of goods and services appearing in the"},{"pageNumber":561,"pageContent":"54 6  TRAGEDY AND HOPE market is at one and the same time the income of the community and aggregate cost of producing the goods and services in question, * sums expended by the entrepreneur on wages, rents, salaries, raw m ate \" rials, interest, lawyers' fees, and so on, represent costs to him and incom to those who receive them. His own profits also enter the picture, sw c they are his income and the cost of persuading him to produce the wea in question. The goods are offered for sale at a price which is equa 1 the sum of all costs (including profits). In the community as a who - aggregate costs, aggregate incomes, and aggregate prices are the same, sn they are merely opposite sides of the identical expenditures. The purchasing power available in the community is equal to ir> c01 minus savings. If there are anv savings, the available purchasing P° v will be less than the aggregate prices being asked for the products sale and by the amount of the savings.

Left to itself, the °noniic system under modern conditions would adopt the former P ocedure. This would work roughly as follows: The existence of the ationary gap (that is, available purchasing power less than aggregate I ces °» available goods and services) will result in falling prices, declin- 5 economic activity, and rising unemployment. All this will result in in national income, and this in turn will result in an even more P decline in the volume of savings. This decline continues until the me of savings reaches the level of investment, at which point the fall rested and the economy becomes stabilized at a low level. As t . matter of fact, this process did not work itself out in any indus- country during tne g reat depression of 1929-1934, because the P nty i n tne distribution of the national income was so great that a . erable portion of the population would have been driven to zero es and absolute want before the savings of the richer segment of the P ation fell to the level of investment.

Outright destruction of goods already produced is not common, and occurred for the first time as a method of combating depression in the years 1930-1934. During this period, stores of coffee, sugar, and bananas were destroyed, corn was plowed under, and young livestock was slaughtered to reduce the supply on the market. The de- struction of goods in warfare is another example of this method 0 overcoming deflationary conditions in the economic system. The second method of filling the deflationary gap, namely, by p r °' ducing goods which do not enter the market, accomplishes its purpose o) providing purchasing power in the market, since the costs of productio of such goods do enter the market as purchasing power, while the go° themselves do not drain funds from the system if they are not oftere for sale. New investment was the usual way in which this was accon plished in the normal business cycle, but it is not the normal way filling the gap under modern conditions of depression. We have B ready seen the growing reluctance to invest and the unlikely chance t the purchasing power necessary for prosperity will be provided by constant stream of private investment. If this is so, the funds for p ducing goods which do not enter the market must be sought in a pr«g r of public spending.    ,     Any program of public spending at once runs into the problems inflation and public debt. These are the same two problems which w mentioned in an earlier chapter in connection with the efforts of g ernments to pay for the First World War. The methods of paying i° a depression are exactly the same as the methods of paying for a N ' ' except that the combination of methods used may be somewhat dirrc shod Id because the goals are somewhat different. In financing a war, WC seek to achieve a method which will provide a maximum of output a minimum of inflation and public debt. In dealing with a depression, » a chief aim is to close the deflationary gap, the goal will be to proyi maximum of output with a necessary degree of inflation and a mm 11 ^ of public debt. Thus, the use of fiat money 7 is more justifiable in finan r a depression than in financing a war. Moreover, the selling of bon private persons in wartime might well be aimed at the lower-in groups in order to reduce consumption and release facilities ror . production, while in a depression (where low consumption is the problem) such sales of bonds to finance public spending would t» be aimed at the savings of the upper-income sjroups. These ideas on the role of government spending in combating o r sion have been formally organized into the \"theory of the compensa economy.\" This theory advocates that government spending an , policies be organized so that they work exactly contrary to the 01 • cycle, with lower taxes and larger spending in a deflationary perio higher taxes with reduced spending in a boom period, the fiscal"},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"a CHANGING ECONOMIC PATTERNS  549  the down cycle being counterbalanced in the national budget by the surpluses of the up cycle. this compensatory economy has not been applied with much success an V European country except Sweden. In a democratic country, it ould take the control of taxing and spending away from the elected presentatives of the people and place this precious \"power of the r rs e at the control of the automatic processes of the business cycle as erpreted by bureaucratic (and unrepresentative) experts. Moreover, these programs of deficit spending are in jeopardy in a country with private banking system. In such a system, the creation of money (or e uit) is usually reserved for the private banking institutions, and is precated as a government action. The argument that the creation of ids by the government is bad while creation of funds by the banks is t-aiy is very pcrsusasive in a system based on traditional laissez faire W which the usual avenues of communications (such as newspapers radio) are under private, or even banker, control. folic spending as a method of counteracting depression can vary r> greatly in character, depending on the purposes of the spending. pending fo r destruction of goods or for restriction of output, as under early New Deal agricultural program, cannot be justified easily in a ocratic country with freedom of communications, because it obvi- y results in a decline in national income and living standards. Spend- in^ f 6 or nonproductive monuments is somewhat easier to justify but is y a long-run solution. Spending for investment in productive equip- nt (like the TVA) is obviously the best solution, since it leads to increase in national wealth and standards of living and is a long-run ton, but it marks a permanent departure from a system of private P'tahsm, and can be easily attacked in a country with a capitalistic °gy and a private banking system. Spending on armaments and 'onal defense is the last method of fighting depression and is the one st readily and most widely adopted in the twentieth century. th ? ro S ram °f public expenditure on armaments is a method for filling enationary gap and overcoming depression because it adds purchas- arm ° Wer t0 r ^ e mar ^ et \"without drawing it out again later (since the anients, once produced, are not put up for sale).

Heavy industry is the"},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"55°  TRAGEDY AND HOPE segment of the economy which suffers earliest and most drastically in a depression, which absorbs manpower most readily (thus reducing unem- ployment) and which is politically influential in most countries. Such a program is also easily justified to the public on grounds of national de- fense, especially if other countries are dealing with their economic crises by the same method of treatment. The adoption of rearmament as a method of combating depression does not have to be conscious. The country which adopts it may honestly < ce that it is adopting the policy for good reasons, that it is threatened o\\ aggression, and that a program of rearmament is necessary for politic* 1 protection. It is very rare for a country consciously to adopt a progran of aggression, for, in most wars, both sides are convinced that their action are defensive. It is almost equally rare for a country to adopt a poliCJ of rearmament as a solution for depression. But, unconsciously, the dange from a neighbor and the advantages to be derived from rearming m l face of such a danger are always more convincing to a country wn ° economic system is functioning below capacity than it is to a counti. which is riding a boom. Moreover, if a country adopts rearmament becau of fear of another country's arms, and these last are the result of erroi to fill a deflationary gap, it can also be said that the rearmament or t former has a basic economic cause. As we have mentioned, Fascism is the adoption by the vested intere in a society of an authoritarian form of government in order to maiflt their vested interests and prevent the reform of the society. In the tw tieth century in Europe, the vested interests usually sought to prevent reform of the economic system (a reform whose need was made evic by the long-drawn-out depression) by adopting an economic pr°g ra whose chief element was the effort to fill the deflationary gap by re- armament.

Ibis almost simultaneous failure of laissez faire, of economic Fascism, n <J of Communism to satisfy the growing popular demand both for rising andards of living and for spiritual liberty has forced the mid-twentieth entury to seek some new economic organization. This demand has been ensified by the arrival on the scene of new peoples, new nations, and w tribes who by their demands for these same goods have shown their g owing awareness of the problems, and their determination to do some- lf ig about them.

Unlike the northern War lords, this party had ideals and a program, although it must be con- e ssed that both of these were embodied in words rather than in deeds. *he Kuomintang ideals were a mixture of Western, native Chinese, and Bolshevik Russian factors. They sought to achieve a unified, inde- pendent China w ith a democratic government and a mixed, cooperative, °cialistic, individualistic economic system. In general, Dr. Sun went to ma's own traditions for his cultural ideas, to Western (largely Anglo- American) traditions for his political ideas, and to a mixture, with strong ocialist elements, for his economic ideas. His program envisaged the mevement of these ideals through three successive stages of develop- ment of which the first would be a period of military domination to c ure unity and independence, the second would be a period of Kuomin- tan g dictatorship to secure the necessary political education of the masses, °nly the third would be one of constitutional democracy. This pro- s am was followed as far as Stage Two. This presumably was reached in '927 with the announcement that the Kuomintang would henceforth be e sole legal political party. This had been preceded by eleven years military domination in which Chiang Kai-shek emerged as the military r of most of China in the name of the Kuomintang. n e Kuomintang, under Dr. Sun's influence, accepted the support and e of the ideas of the Communist International, especially in the period 4-1927.

Soong and Kung between them dominated the Kuomintang government, the former becoming minister of finance while the latter was minister of industry, commerce, and labor. In 1927 the Communist collaboration was ended by the Kuomintang, the Russians were expelled from China, and the Kuomintang became the only legal party. The native Chinese Communists, under Moscow- trained leaders like Mao Tse-tung, concentrated their strength in the southern rural areas where they established themselves by agrarian re- forms, expropriating landlords, reducing rents, taxes, and interest rates, and building a Communist rural militia manned by the peasants. As soon as the Nationalist forces under Chiang Kai-shek completed the conquest 01 northern China with the capture of Peking in June 1928, they shifted their attack southward in an effort to destroy the Communist center VX Kiangsi.

All ese discussions neglect the vital point that the Japanese army in Man- r, a was not under the control of the Japanese civil government, 11 which negotiations were being conducted, and that these civil lonties, who opposed the Manchurian attack, could not give effective 1Ce to this opposition without risking assassination. Premier Yuko atnaguchi had been killed as recently as November 1930 for approving e London Naval Agreement to which the militarists objected, and crnier Ki Inukai was dealt with in the same way in May 1932. u 'oughout, the League discussions were not conducted with the \"ght party. P «-Xcept for its violation of nationalist feelings and the completely jectionable means by which it was achieved, the acquisition of Man- Una by Japan possessed many strategic and economic advantages. It °' ve Japan industrial resources which it vitally needed, and could, in Tlc i have strengthened the Japanese economy.

Above all, it could have served as a counterpoise soviet power in the Far East and provided a fulcrum to restrain Vlet actions in Europe after the collapse of Germany.

As they were pre- paring their new assault, Chiang Kai-shek was busy preparing a sixth campaign against the Communists, still lurking in the remote north- western part of China. Neither the growing threat from Japan nor the appeals from the Chinese Communists to form a united Chinese front against Nippon deterred Chiang from his purpose to crush the Com- munists until, in December 1936, he was suddenly kidnapped by his own northern commander, Chang Hsueh-liang, at Sian, and was forced, under a threat of death, to promise to fight Japan. A Kuomintang-Com- munist united front was formed in which Chiang promised to ngh Japan rather than the Communists and to relax the Kuomintang re- strictions on civil liberties, while the Communists promised to abolis their Chinese Soviet Government, become a regional government of tne Republic of China, end the expropriation of the landlords, cease their attacks on the Kuomintang, and incorporate their armed forces mt° the National Army of Chiang Kai-shek on a regional basis. This agreement had hardly been made, and had not yet been p uD ' lished, when the Japanese opened their attack on North China 1937). They were generally successful against a tenacious defense by the National government, driving it successively from Nanking to Han- kow (November 1937) and from Hankow to Chungking on the remote upper reaches of the Yangtze River (October 1938). The Japanese, with quite inadequate forces of only seventeen divisions totaling l esS than 250,000 men in all areas, tried to destroy the Nationalist and Com- munist armies in China, to cut China off from all foreign su pplies by controlling all railroads, ports, and rivers, and to maintain order i° Manchuria and occupied China. This was an impossible task. The occu- pied areas soon took the form of an open lattice in which Japanes troops patroled the rivers and railroads, but the country between w a largely in the control of Communist guerrillas. The retreat of the N*\" tionalist government to remote Chungking and its inability to retain the allegiance of the Chinese peasants, especially those behind tD Japanese lines, because of its close alliance with the oligarchy of land- lords, merchants, and bankers, steadily weakened the Kuomintang an strengthened the Communists. The rivalry between the Chinese Communists and the Kuomintang broke out intermittently in 1938-1941, but Japan was unable to pr Ql1 from it in any decisive way because of its economic weakness.

By 1938 the products of heavy in- dustry accounted for 53 percent of Japan's industrial output. This ln creased Japan's need for imports while reducing her ability to provide e exports (previously textiles) to pay for such imports. By 1937 J a Pan's unfavorable balance of trade with the \"non-yen\" area amounted 0 925 million yen, or almost four times the average of the years before '937. Income from shipping was reduced by military demands as well, tyith the result that Japan's unfavorable balance of trade was reflected m a heavy outflow of gold (1,685 million yen in 1937-1938). \"V the end of 1938, it was clear that Japan was losing its financial ncl commercial ability to buy necessary materials of foreign origin, he steps taken by the United States, Australia, and others to restrict x Port of strategic or military materials to Japan made this problem ^ e n more acute. The attack on China had been intended to remedy is situation by removing the Chinese boycott on Japanese goods, by ringing a supply of necessary materials, especially raw cotton, under Japan's direct control, and by creating an extension of the yen area \"ere the use of foreign exchange would not be needed for trading P Ur poses. On the whole, these purposes were not achieved. Guerrilla ivities and Japanese inability to control the rural areas made the levement of a yen area impossible, made trade difficult, and reduced . e production of cotton drastically (by about one-third). Export of 0 ore from China to Japan fell from 2.3 million tons in 1937 to 0.3 'on in 1938, although coal exports rose slightly. n an effort to increase production, Japan began to pour capital in- ment into the still-unpacified areas of North China at a rate which ed the rate of investment in Manchuria. The Four-Year Plan of y 3 called for 1,420 million yen of such investment by 1942. This of \\ CCt ' ac ^ ec * to l ' ie neec * for Japan to feed and clothe the inhabitants orth China, made that area a drain on the whole Japanese economy, lat Japanese exports to that area rose from 179 billion yen in 1937 3'2 million in 1938.

The two most vital needs were in petroleum products and rubber. To the militarists, who controlled Japan both politically and eco- nomically after 1939, it seemed that the occupation of the Dutch Indies and Malaya could do much to alleviate these shortages. The occupation of the Netherlands itself by Hitler's hordes in 1940 and the involvement of England in the European war since 1939 seemed to offer a golden opportunity for Japan to seize these southern regions. To do so wouW require long lines of communications from Japan to Indonesia. These lines would be exposed to attack from the American bases in the Philip\" pines or from the British base at Singapore. Judging the American psV\" chology as similar to their own, the Japanese militarists were sure that in such circumstances America would not hesitate to attack these vulnerable lines of communication. Thus, it seemed to them that • Japanese attack on the Dutch Indies would inevitably lead to an Amefl' can war on Japan. Facing this problem, the Japanese militarists reache what seemed to their minds to be an inescapable decision. They decide to attack the United States first. From this decision came the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.

This significant event revealed that Italy was the only major Power prepared to fight for Austria's independence and that Mussolini's seven years of work for the revisionist cause had been a mistake. It was, however, a mistake from which the Duce learned noth- ing. Instead, he condoned an assassination plot by extreme revisionist elements, including the Bulgarian IMRO, Creation separatists, ana Hungarian extremists. This resulted in the murder of Alexander, the centralist Serb King of Yugoslavia, and Jean Louis Barthou, the foreign minister of France, at Marseilles in October 1934. Hitler's ascension to office in Germany in January 1933 found French foreign policy paralyzed by British opposition to any efforts to support collective security or to enforce German observation of its treaty ob- ligations by force. As a result, a suggestion from Poland in April 1933 for joint armed intervention in Germany to remove Hitler from office was rejected by France. Poland at once made a nonaggression pact with Germany and extended a previous nonaggression pact with the Sovie Union (January-May, 1934). This inaugurated a policy of balancing between these two Great Powers which left Poland ripe for the Fourth Partition, which came in 1939. After the advent to office in France of a new conservative coalition government with Jean Louis Bathou as foreign minister in February 1934, France began to adopt a more active policy against Hitler. This policy sought to encircle Germany by bringing the Soviet Union ana Italy into a revived alignment of France, Poland, the Little Entente, Greece, and Turkey. A Balkan Pact of Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey was concluded as early as February 1934; French rela- tions with the Little Entente were tightened as a consequence of visits by Barthou to the various capitals. Russia was brought into the League of Nations in September 1934; a French-Italian agreement was signe in January 1935; a common front against German rearmament (whic had been announced in March) was made by France, Italy, and Bntai at the Stresa Conference in April 1935, and Germany's action was de- nounced by the League of Nations the same w eek; a French-Soviet alliance and a Czech-Soviet alliance were made in May 1935, the latter to be binding on Russia only after the earlier French-Czech allianc went into effect. In the course of building this united front agains Germany, but before Italy had been brought into it, Barthou and Ri n & Alexander were assassinated at Marseilles, as we have indicated (t-> c ' tober 1934).

Accordingly, Laval gave Mussolini seven percent °* the stock of the Djibouti-Addis Ababa Railway (which ran from 'tench Somaliland on the Red Sea to the capital of Ethiopia), a stretch °f desert 114,000 square miles in extent but containing only a few hun- dred persons (sixty-two, according to Mussolini himself) on the border °f Libya, a small wedge of territory between French Somaliland and Italian Eritrea, a settlement of the citizenship and education status of Italian immigrants in French Tunisia, and \"the right to ask for con- cessions throughout Ethiopia.\" I his last point was an important one because, while Laval insisted tot he had made no agreement which jeopardized Ethiopia's independ- ence or territorial integrity, he made it equally clear that Italian support gainst Germany was more important than the integrity of Ethiopia in nis eyes. France had been Ethiopia's only real friend for many years, t had engineered a Triparite agreement of Britain, Italy, and France to permit no change in Ethiopia's status without Tripartite consent in r 9°6, and had brought Ethiopia into the League of Nations over British °]ections in 1923. Italy, on the other hand, had been prevented from °nquering Ethiopia in 1896 only by a decisive defeat of her invading °rce at the hands of the Ethiopians themselves, while in 1925 Britain d Italy had cut Ethiopia up into economic spheres by an agreement ni ch was annulled by a French appeal to the League of Nations. La- s renunciation of France's traditional support of Ethiopian independ- val ce and integrity was thus of great importance, and brought the three \"oven us is Thi: & v ernments concerned (Italy, Britain, and France) into agreement on th « issue. , nis point of view, however, was not shared by public opinion in Se three countries.

Baldwin, who in November, 1934, had declared that a \"collec- tive peace system\" was \"perfectly impracticable,\" assured the organizers of the ballot that \"the foreign policy of the Government is founded upon the League of Nations,\" when the results were revealed in J^v 1935. On this basis was erected one of the most astonishing examples 01 British \"dual\" policy in the appeasement period. While publicly sup- porting collective security and sanctions against Italian aggression, the government privately negotiated to destroy the League and to y' e ' d Ethiopia to Italy. They were completely successful in this secret policy The Italian aggression against Ethiopia began with an incursion i nt0 Ethiopian territory at Wal Wal in December 1934, and broke into full- scale invasion in October 1935. That Italy had no real fear of British mili- tary sanctions against them was evident when they put a major part of tnei military forces, transports, and naval strength in the Red Sea, separate from home by the British-controlled Suez Canal and the massed Britis fleet at Alexandria. Their use of the Suez Canal to transport munitions and troops naturally revealed their aggressive intentions to Britain at a early stage. The British government's position on Ethiopia was clear V stated in a secret report of an Interdepartmental Committee under I\" John Maffey. The report, presented to the foreign secretary on June ' ' 1935, declared that Italian control of Ethiopia would be a \"matter c indifference\" to Britain. This report was mysteriously and surrep' tiously conveyed to the Italians and undiplomatically published by the later. There can be no doubt that it represented the opinion of British government and that this opinion was shared by the Fren government. Unfortunately, public opinion in both countries and through 0 most of the world was insisting on collective sanctions against the at, gressor.

Ethiopia's appeal for neutral ob- rvers on June 19th was never acknowledged, and her appeal to the mted States for support under the Kellogg-Briand Pact on July 3rd as at once rejected, but Eden found time to offer .Mussolini a portion Ethiopia as part of a deal which would avoid an open Italian ag- gression (June 24th). The Duce was determined, however, to commit n open aggression as the only method for achieving that modicum of Ionian glory for which he thirsted. Hoare's speech in support of collective security at Geneva in Septem- er evoked such applause from the British public that Baldwin decided 0 hold a general election on that issue. Accordingly, with a ringing P ea ge to support collective action and collective security and to \"take 0 action in isolation,\" the National government offered itself at the r° » on November 14, 1935, and won an amazing victory. The govern- ents margin of 431 seats out of 615 kept it in power until the next e neral Election ten years later (July 1945).

To save his government, Baldwin had to sacrifice Hoare, who resigned on December 19th, but returned to the Cabinet on June 5, 1936, as soon as Ethiopia was decently buried. Laval, in France, survived the first parliamentary assault but fell from office in January 1936; he was succeeded at the Quai d'Orsay by Pierre Flandin, who pursued the same policy. Ethiopia was conquered on May 2, 1936 and annexed to Italy a week later. Sanctions were removed by the various cooperating states and by the League itself in the next two months, just as they were beginning to take effect. The consequences of the Ethiopian fiasco were of the greatest im- portance. Mussolini was much strengthened in Italy by his appare n success in acquiring an empire in the face of the economic barrag of fifty-two nations. The Conservative Party in England was entrenche in office for a decade, during which it carried out its policy of ap- peasement and waged the resulting war. The United States was drive by panic to pass a \"Neutrality Act\" which encouraged aggression DJ its provision that the outbreak of a war would cut off supplies of Ameri- can munitions to both sides, to the aggressor who had armed at hi leisure and to the victim yet unarmed. Above all, the Ethiopian crisi destroyed French efforts to encircle Germany. Britain had opp° se these efforts from the beginning, and was able to block them with tn aid of a number of other factors for which Britain was not primarily responsible. This point is sufficiently important to demand detailed an- alysis.

In that case, Mussolini argued, Africa would have been re- moved from the sphere of League action as North America had been in r 9'9 (by the Monroe Doctrine amendment to the Covenant) and Asia ha Q been in 1931 (by the failure to take action against Japan). This v ould have left the League as a purely European organization, accord- m g to Mussolini. This view was regarded with favor in France where the chief, if not ^ sole, role of the League was to provide security against Germany. his view was completely unacceptable to Britain, which wanted no delusively European political organization and could not join one her- e 1 because of her imperial obligations and her preference for an At- antic organization (including the Dominions and the United States). hus, Britain insisted on sanctions against Italy. But the British govern- ent never wanted collective security to be a success. As a result, the tench desire for no sanctions combined with the British desire for \"effective sanctions to provide ineffective sanctions. Because there were sa nctions, France lost Italian support against Germany; because they ere ineffective, France lost the League system of collective security gainst Germany as well. Thus France had neither bread nor cake. °rse than that, the Italian involvement in Africa withdrew Italian \"° ltlCa l power from central Europe and thus removed the chief force , ead y t0 resist the German penetration of Austria. Still worse, the hub- of the Ethiopian crisis gave Hitler an opportunity to declare the armament of Germany and the reestablishment of the German air yce m March 1935 and to remilitarize the Rhineland on March 7, 1936. A he remilitarization of the Rhineland in violation of the Versailles eaty anc j ^ L ocarno pacts was the most important result of the 'opian crisis and the most important event of the period of appease- , nt \" \" greatly reduced France's own security and reduced even more security of France's allies to the east of Germany because, once zone was fortified, it could decrease greatly France's ability to come e aid of eastern Europe. The remilitarization of the Rhineland was essential military prerequisite for any movement of Germany east- against Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, or the Soviet Union. That a movement was the chief aim of Hitler's policy had been clearly explicitly stated by him throughout his public life. rrnan rearmament had proceeded so slowly that Germany had only y-nve \"paper\" divisions in 1936, and the German generals de- ed and obtained written orders to retreat if France made any move h H | V t ' le Rh' n eland.

In a violent scene with Flandin on March 12th, Neville Chamberlain rejected sanctions, and refused to accept Flandin's argument that \"if a firm front is maintained by France and England, Germany' will yi c '\" without war.\" Chamberlain's refusal to enforce the Locarno pacts when they fell due was not his personal policy or anything new. It was the policy of the Conservative Partv, and had been for years; as early as July 13, 1934, Sir Austen Chamberlain had stated publicly that Britain would not use troops to enforce the Rhineland clauses and would use its veto power in the Council of the League to prevent this by others under the Locarno pacts. The remilitarization of the Rhineland also detached Belgium from the anti-German circle. Alarmed by the return of German troops to i £S border and by the failure of the British-Italian guarantee of Locarno, Belgium in October 1936 denounced its alliance with France and adopted a policy of strict neutrality. This made it impossible f° r France to extend its fortification system, the Maginot Line, which was being built on the French-German border, along the Belgian-German border. Moreover, since France was convinced that Belgium would on its side in any future war with Germany, the line was not extende along the French-Belgian border either. It was across this unfortine border that Germany attacked France in 1940. Thus Barthou's efforts to encircle Germany were largely but not com- pletely destroyed in the period 1934-1936 by four events: (1) the loss 0 Poland in January 1934; (2) the loss of Italy by January 1936; (3) u rearmament of Germany and the remilitarization of the Rhineland p March 1936; and (4) the loss of Belgium by October 1936. The cnie items left in the Barthou system were the French and Soviet alliance with Czechoslovakia and with each other. In order to destroy t\" eS alliances Britain and Germany sought, on parallel paths, to enciic France and the Soviet Union in order to dissuade France from honon g its alliances with either Czechoslovakia or the Soviet Union. To hon these alliances France required two things as an absolute minimum: { •) that military cooperation against Germany be provided by Bn a from the first moment of any French action against Germany and ( that France have military security on her non-German frontiers. \"O of these essentials were destroyed bv Britain in the period 1935-1936' a in consequence, France, finding itself encircled, dishonored its alua with Czechoslovakia, when it came due in September 1938.

This distinction * as the motivation of the Locarno pacts, and explains the refusal of ntain to engage in military conversations with France until the sum- me r of 1938, The British attitude toward eastern Europe was made per- e ctly clear on many occasions.

We have already discussed all ese except the last, and have indicated the vital role which Britain P a yed in all of them except Belgium. Taken together, they changed e French military position so drastically that France, by 1938, found erself in a position where she could hardly expect to fulfill her military ligations to Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. This was exactly le position in which the British government wished France to be, a ct made completely clear by the recently published secret documents, n May of 1935 France could have acted against Germany with all r 'orces, because the Rhineland was unfortified, and there was no eed to worry about the Italian, Spanish, or Belgian frontiers or the P antic coastline. By the end of 1938, and even more by 1939, the ^ineland was protected by the new German fortified Siegfried Line, P ar ts of the French Army had to be left on the unfriendly Italian and P a nish frontiers and along the lengthy neutral Belgian frontier, and Atlantic coastline could not be protected against the new German neet unless Britain cooperated with France. This need for British co- peration on the sea arose from two facts: (a) the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of June 1935 allowed Germany to build a navy up to 35 f r ~ ent °f the British Navy, while France was restricted to 33 percent stain's strength in the chief categories of vessels; and (b) the Italian c cupatio n of the Balearic Islands and parts of Spain itself after the pening 0 f the Spanish War in July 1936 required much of the French to stay in the Mediterranean in order to keep open the transporta- 01 troops and food from North Africa to metropolitan France e details of the Spanish War will be discussed in the next chapter, a t this point it must be realized that the shift in the control of Spain"},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"580  TRAGEDY AND HOPE from pro-French to anti-French hands was of vital importance to Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union as a factor in determining whether the French alliances with these two would be fulfilled when the German attack came. Parallel with the encirclement of France went the encirclement 01 the Soviet Union and, to a lesser extent, of Czechoslovakia. The encircle- ment of the Soviet Union was known as the Anti-Comintern Pact. This was a union of Germany and Japan against Communism and the Thir International. It was signed in November 1936 and was joined by Italy a year later. Manchukuo and Hungary joined in February 1939. w \" Spain came in a month after that. The last countercircle was that against Czechoslovakia. Hungary ° n the Czechoslovak southern frontier and Germany on its northwestern frontier were both opposed to Czechoslovakia as an \"artificial\" creatio of the Versailles Conference. The German annexation of Austria i n March 1938 closed the gap in the anti-Czech circle on the west, while the aggressive designs of Poland after 1932 completed the circle every- where except on the insignificant Romanian frontier in the extrem east. Although the Czechs offered the Poles a treaty and even a militat} alliance on three occasions, in 1932-1933, they were ignored, and tn Polish-German agreement of January 1934 opened a campaign of vl11 ' fication of Czechoslovakia by Poland which continued, parallel to tn similar German campaign, until the Polish invasion of Czechoslovakia 1 October 1938. Of these three countercircles to Barthou's efforts to encircle GC' many, the most significant by far was the encirclement of France whic alone made the other two possible.

Accordingly, we must say a w° r about the motivations of Britain and the reactions of France.

This Round Table Group formed the core of the ree-bloc-world supporters, and differed from the anti-Bolsheviks like ^bernon in that they sought to contain the Soviet Union between German-dominated Europe and an English-speaking bloc rather than f Wo estroy it as the anti-Bolsheviks wanted.

The more moderate Round Table group, including Lionel Cur 1 Leopold Amery (who was the shadow of Lord Milner), Lord Lothian* Lord Brand, and Lord Astor, sought to weaken the League of Nations an destroy all possibility of collective security in order to strengthen O e many in respect to both France and the Soviet Union, and above a to free Britain from Europe in order to build up an \"Atlantic b\\oC Great Britain, the British Dominions, and the United States. They p r pared the way for this \"Union\" through the Rhodes Scholarship organ ization (of which Lord Milner was the head in 1905-1925 and L° Lothian was secretary in 1925-1940), through the Round Table g roU \" (which had been set up in the United States, India, and the Bn ' Dominions in 1910-1917), through the Chatham House organiz-tio which set up Roval Institutes of International Affairs in all the domW J '    u \"L^n* and a Council on Foreign Relations in New York, as well as througn official Commonwealth Relations Conferences\" held irregularly, and Institutes of Pacific Relations set up in various countries as autonom branches of the Royal Institutes of International Affairs.

These were both used by e two inner groups to command public support for their quite differ- , nt policies. Of the two the appeasers were much more important than peace at any price\" people. The appeasers swallowed the steady £opaganda (much of it emanating from Chatham House, The Times, e Round Table groups, or Rhodes circles) that the Germans had been c ^ivcd and brutally treated in 1919. For example, it was under pres- e from seven persons, including General Smuts and H. A. L. Fisher, Well as Lord Milner himself, that Lloyd George made his belated land on June 2, 1919, that the German reparations be reduced and Rhineland occupation be cut from fifteen years to two. The mem- fauiTi from which Lloyd George read these demands was apparently a\\vn up by Philip Kerr (Lord Lothian), while the minutes of the ^uncil of Four, from which we get the record of those demands, e taken down by Sir Maurice Hankey (as secretary to the Supreme , Unc ''i a position obtained through Lord Esher).

On this feeling, which , \"so much to the British idea of sportsmanlike conduct toward a en opponent, was built the movement for appeasement.

The trouble with this argument was tna once Germany reached this point, it would be very difficult to preven Germany from going further (such as taking the Sudetenland and t Polish Corridor). Accordingly, many of the appeasers, when this p° in was reached in March 1938 went over to the anti-Bolshevik or \"three- bloc\" point of view, while some even went into the \"peace at a n ; price\" group. It is likelv that Chamberlain, Sir John Simon, and N Samuel Hoare went by this road from appeasement to anti-Bolshevisn.

The uprising, however, was already beginning in England and in Italy, and broke out in Morocco on July 18th. One of the chief figures in the conspiracy in England was Douglas Jerrold, a well-known editor, who has revealed some details in his auto- biography. At the end of May 1936, he obtained \"50 machine guns and a half million rounds of S.A. ammunition\" for the cause. In June he per- suaded Major Hugh Pollard to fly to the Canary Islands in order to transport General Franco by plane to Morocco. Pollard took off on July >ith with his nineteen-year-old daughter Diana and her friend Dorothy Watson. Louis Bolin, who was Jerrold's chief contact with the con- spirators, went at once to Rome. On July 15th orders were issued by the Julian Air Force to certain units to prepare to fly to Spanish Morocco, he Italian insignia on these planes were roughly painted over on July 2 °th and thereafter, but otherwise they were fully equipped. These planes ^ Ve nt into action in support of the revolt as early as July 27th; on July 30th °ur such planes, still carrying their orders of July 15th, landed in French A1 gcri a , and were interned. German intervention was less carefully planned. It would appear that an jurjo went to Berlin on February 4, 1936, but could get no commit- ent beyond a promise to provide the necessary transport planes to 0v e the Moroccan forces to Spain if the Spanish fleet made transport by a ° an gerous by remaining loyal to the government. As soon as Franco a cned Morocco from the Canaries on July 18th, he appealed for these anes through a personal emissary to Hitler and through the German n sul at Tetuan. The former met Hitler on July 24th, and was promised 'stance. The plans to intervene were drawn up the same night by Hit- ' Coring, and General Werner von Blomberg. Thirty planes with r man crews were sent to Spain by August 8th, and the first one was Ptured by the Loyalist government the next day. the meantime, the revolt was a failure. The navy remained loval be- e the crews overthrew their officers; the air force generally re- fed loyal; the army revolted, along with much of the police, but, pt in isolated areas, these rebellious units were overcome.

They had the unlimited support of Italy and Portugal, as well as un- limited sympathy and tentative support from Germany. But the rebel position was desperate by the end of July. On July 25th the German ambassador informed his government that the revolt could not succeed \"unless something unforeseen happens.\" By August 25th the acting state secretary of foreign affairs in Germany, Hans Dieckhoff, wrote, \"it 1S not to be expected that the Franco Government can hold out for long* even after outward successes, without large-scale support from out- side.\" In the meantime, Italian and Portuguese aid kept the rebellion going- The French and British, whose only desire at first was to avoid an ope n clash arising from the Great Powers' supplying arms and men to opp 0 ' site sides in the conflict were prepared to sacrifice any interests of their countries to avoid this. Impelled by pacifist sentiments, and a desire to avoid war at any cost, French Premier Leon Blum and French Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos suggested on August 1, 1936, that an agreement not to intervene in Spain should be signed by the chief Powers concerned. This idea was eagerly taken up by Britain and was acceptable to the Popular Front government of France, since it was clear that if there was no intervention, the Spanish government could suppress the rebels. Grea Britain accepted the French offer at once, but efforts to get Portuga > Italy, Germany, and Russia into the agreement were difficult becaus of the delays made by Portugal and Italy, both of which were helping t rebels. By August 24th all six Powers had agreed, and by August 2° the agreement went into effect.

In u gust 1036, when a Loyalist cruiser intercepted a British freighter c j|rrying supplies to Morocco, the British battle cruiser Repulse went ter the Spanish cruiser cleared for action. On the other hand, the Wish refusal to recognize the rebel government, or to grant it belliger- nt status, placed interference with shipping bv these forces in the cate- gory of piracy; yet Britain did almost nothing when in one year (June °37-June 1938) 10 British ships were sunk, 10 were captured and held, i0 more were seriously damaged, and at least 12 others were damaged ° v the rebels out of a total of 140 British ships which went to Spain in year. By the beginning of 1937 Britain was clearly seeking a rebel victory, and, instead of trying to enforce nonintervention or to protect British rights on the seas, was actively supporting the rebel blockade °f Loyalist Spain. This was clearly evident when the British Navy after ^ a y 1937 began to intercept British ships headed for Loyalist ports and on some pretext, or simply by force, made them go elsewhere, such as Bordeaux or Gibraltar. These tactics were admitted by the First Lord °f the Admiralty in the House of Commons on June 29, 1938. The rebel forces were fewer in numbers than the Loyalists, and fought with less vigor and under poor leadership, according to German secret reports from Spain at the time, but were eventually successful De caus e of their great superiority in artillery, aviation, and tanks, as a ^ s «lt of the one-sided enforcement of the nonintervention agreement.

This was given a monopoly on the export of goods to Spain, and orders were issued to the German Navy to protect these goods in transit. The failure of the Franco forces to capture Madrid led to a join Italian-German meeting in Berlin on October 20, 1936. There it w aS decided to embark on a policy of extensive support for Franco. As par of this policy both Powers recognized the Franco government ano withdraw their recognition from Madrid on November 18, 1936, an Italy signed a secret alliance with the rebel government ten days later- Japan recognized the Franco regime early in December, following the signature of the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact of Novem- ber 25, 1936. As a result of all these actions, Franco received the full support o the aggressor states, while the Loyalist government was obstructed m every way by the \"peace-loving\" Powers. While the Axis assistance to the rebels was chiefly in the form of supplies and technical assistance, it was also necessary to send a large number of men to work some 0 this equipment or even to fight as infantry.

After the Battle of Teruel, at which such \"foreign Reds\" were supposed to be very active, Franco had to report to Germany that he had found \"very few\" among the 14,500 captives taken; this fact had to be kept \"strictly confidential,\" he said (December 1937). As a matter of fact, intervention in Spain by the Soviet Union was not only limited in quantity; it was also of brief duration, chiefly between October 1936 and January' 1937. The road to Spain was, f° r the Soviet Union, a difficult one, as the Italian submarine fleet was wait- ing for Russian shipping in the Mediterranean, and did not hesitate to sink it. This was done in the last few months of 1936. Moreover, the Anti-Comintern Pact of November 1936 and the Japanese attack oft North China in 1937 made it seem that all Russian supplies were neede at home. Furthermore, the Soviet Union was more concerned with J#- opening supplies to Loyalist Spain from France, Britain, or elsewhere, because, in a competition of supplies and troops in Spain, the Sovie Union could not match Italy alone and certainly not Italy, Germa n >' and Portugal together. Finally, the German government in 1936 g a \\ the Czechoslovak leader Edward Benes documents indicating that vari- ous Soviet Army officers were in contact with German Army officer' When Benes sent these documents on to Stalin, they gave rise to series of purges and treason trials in the Soviet Union, which large, eclipsed the Spanish Civil War and served to put a stop to the m a l° part of the Soviet contribution to the Loyalist government. Efforts compensate for this decrease in Soviet support by an increase in supp 0 by the Third International were not effective, since the latter orga zation could get men to go to Spain but could not obtain military sl r plies, which were what the Loyalist government needed for t 1 own manpower.

That fear of war was a powerful motive is clear, but such fear was more prevalent outside the government than inside. On December 18, 1936, Eden admitted at the government had exaggerated the danger of war four months ar uer to get the nonintervention agreement accepted, and when Britain anted to use force to achieve its aims, as it did against the piracy of all an submarines in the Mediterranean in the autumn of 1937, it did so 'thout risk of war. The nonintervention agreement, as practiced, was either an aid to peace nor an example of neutrality, but was clearly forced in such a way as to give aid to the rebels and place all possible stacles in the way of the Loyalist government suppressing the rebellion. irus attitude of the British government could not be admitted pub- . vi and every effort was made to picture the actions of the Non- ervention Committee as one of evenhanded neutrality.

The Social Democrats, although very radical and Marxist in word, were very democratic and moderate in deed. In control of the whole country from 1918 to 1920, they were able to make peace, to crush out the threat of Bolshevism from Hungary to the east or from Bavaria to the north, to establish an effective democratic constitution with con- siderable autonomy for the local states (formerly provinces), and to give the new country a good impetus toward becoming a twentieth-century welfare state. The measure of their success may be seen in the fact that the Communists never were able to get established after 1919 or to elect a member to Parliament. On the other hand, the Social Democrats were unable to reconcile their desire for union with Germany (called Ans- chluss) with the need for financial aid from the Entente Powers who opposed this. An agreement between the Pan-Germans and the Christian Socialists to put Anschluss on the shelf and concentrate on getting financial aid from the victorious Entente made it possible to overthrow the coalition Cabinet of Michael Mayr in June 1921, and replace it by a Pan-German' Christian Socialist alliance under the Pan-German Johann Schober. 1° May 1922, this alliance was reversed when the Christian Socialist leader, Monsignor Ignaz Seipel, a Catholic priest, became chancellor. Seip el dominated the federal government of Austria until his death in August 1932, and his policies were carried on after that by his disciples, Dolli usS and Schuschnigg. Seipel was able to achieve a certain amount of finan- cial reconstruction by wringing international loans from the victoriou- Powers of 1918. He achieved this, in spite of Austria's poor credit status, by insisting that he would be unable to prevent Anschluss if Austria reached a stage of financial collapse.

Into this situation the Social Democrats came in 1918. By 1933 they had built almost 60,000 dwellings, mostly in huge apartment houses. Jhese were constructed with hardwood floors, outside windows, gas, el ectricity, and sanitary facilities. In these large apartment buildings more than half the ground space was left free for parks and playgrounds, and central laundries, kindergartens, libraries, clinics, post offices, and other conveniences were provided.

The diver- Sl0n °f public funds to banks and industries controlled by Seipel's sup- Porters was revealed by parliamentary investigations in spite of the government's efforts to conceal the facts. When the federal government ruck back with its own investigation of the finances of the city of tenna, it had to report that thev were in admirable condition. All lls served to increase the appeal of the Social Democrats throughout Ust ria, in spite of their antireligious and materialist orientation. This an be seen from the fact that the Socialist electoral vote increased eaddy, rising from 35 percent of the total vote in 1920 to 39.6 percent . l02 3 to 42 percent in 1927. At the same time, the number of Chris- 'an Socialist seats in Parliament fell from 85 in 1920 to 82 in 1923 to 73 in 1927 to 66 in 1930. in 1927 Monsignor Seipel formed a \"Unity List\" of all the anti-Social- groups he could muster, but he could not turn the tide. The election & av e his party onlv 73 seats compared to 71 for the Social Democrats, 2 tor the Pan-Germans, and 9 for the Agrarian League. x\\ccordinglv, 5ei Pel embarked on a very dangerous project.

This project failed in 1929, when Seipel's constitutional changes were largely rejected bv the Parliament. As a result, it became neces- sary to use illegal methods, a task which was carried out by Seipel's successor, Engelbert Dollfuss, in 1932-1934. The Heimwehr first appeared in 1918-1919 as bands of armed peasants and soldiers formed on the fringes of Austrian territory to resist in- cursions of Italians, South Slavs, and Bolsheviks. After this danger passed, it continued in existence as a loose organization of armed reactionary bands, financed at first by the same German Army groups which were financing the Nazis in Bavaria at the same time (i9 10 ~ 1924). Later these bands were financed by industrialists and bankers as a weapon against the trade unions, and after 1927 by Mussolini as part of his projects of revisionism in the Danube area. At first, these Heimwehr units were fairly independent with their own leaders in different provinces. After 1927 thev tended to coalesce, although rivalry between leaders remained bitter. These leaders were members of the Christian Socialist or Pan-German parties and sometimes had Habsburg sympathies. The leaders were Anton Rintelen and Walter Pfrimer in Styria, Richard Steidle in Tyrol, Prince Ernst Rudiger von Starhemberg in Upper Austria, and Emil Fev in Vienna. The \"chief of the general staff\" of the movement as it became unified was a multi- murderer fugitive from German justice, Waldemar Pabst, who had been involved in numerous political murders ordered by the national- ists in Germanv in the period 1919-1923. These organizations openlv drilled in military formations, made weekly provocative marches into industrial areas of the cities, openly declared their determination to destroy democracy, labor unions, an the Socialists and to change the constitution by force, and assaulte and murdered their critics. Seipel's efforts to amend the constitution by using Heimwehr pr eS \" sure against the Social Democrats failed in 1929, although he did suc- ceed in increasing the powers of the Christian Democratic Presiden Wilhelm Miklas somewhat. About the same time, Seipel rejected a offer from the Social Democrats to disarm and disband both tn Heimwehr and the Social Democratic militia, the Schutzbund. Seipel's tactics alienated his supporters in the Pan-German an Agrarian League so that his party no longer commanded a majority ' the chamber. It resigned in September 1930.

This was done in spite of we fact that the Heimwehr had just introduced into its organization a n oath which bound its members to reject parliamentary democracy in avor of the one-party, cooperative, \"leadership\" state. From this point on i the constitution was steadily violated by the Christian Socialists. New elections were called for November 1930. Starhemberg prom- •sed Pfrimer that they would carry out a Putsch to prevent the elec- l0 ns, and Starhemberg publicly announced, \"Now we are here, and we will not drop the reins, whatever the result of the elections.\" ^ancellor Karl Vaugoin, however, was convinced his group would win the elections; accordingly- he vetoed the Putsch. Minister of Justice *^uber confiscated the papers of the Pan-Germans, the Agrarians, and issident Christian Socialists, as well as of the Social Democrats, during he campaign on the ground that thev were \"Bolshevik.\" In this con- cern of cross-purposes the election was held, the last election held in P r e\\var Austria. The Christian Socialists lost 7 seats, while the Social ernocrats gained 1. The former had 66, the latter 72, the Heimwehr ad 8, and the Pan-German-Agrarian bloc had 19. The minority Seipel |°vernment tamely resigned, replaced by a more moderate Christian Socialist government under Otto Ender with Pan-German-Agrarian sup- Port. m June 1931, though Seipel tried again to form a government, he could not obtain sufficient support, and the weak coalitions of moderate hristian Socialists and Pan-Germans continued in spite of a Heimwehr revolt led by Pfrimer in September 1931. Pfrimer and his followers Vere brought to trial for treason, and acquitted. No effort was made 0 collect their arms, and it soon became clear that the Christian Social- coalition, moved by their own sympathies and fear of Heimwehr ence, we re opening an attack on the Social Democrats and the aoor unions. These attacks were intensified after May 1932, when a e w Cabinet, with Dollfuss as chancellor and Kurt Schuschnigg as mister of justice, took office. This Cabinet had only a one-vote tejority in the Parliament, 83 for and 82 against, and was completely e pendent on the 8 Heimwehr deputies which provided its majority, would not call an election, because the Christian Socialists knew e y would be overwhelmed.

Un March 4, 1933, the Dollfuss government was beaten in Parliament l) > one vote, 81-80. It threw out one vote on a technicality and used the resulting uproar as an excuse to prevent by force any more meetmg s of parliament. Dollfuss ruled by decree, using a law of the Habsburg Empire <> 1917. This law allowed the government to issue emergency econotW- decrees during the war if thev were approved by parliament within a stated period subsequentlv. The Habsburg Empire and the war were both finished, and the decrees of Dollfuss were not concerned win economic matters nor were thev accepted by Parliament within tne stated period, but the government used this method to rule for years- The first decrees ended all meetings, censored the press, suspense local elections, created concentration camps, wrecked the finances ° the city of Vienna bv arbitrarv interference with tax collections a n expenditures, wrecked the supreme constitutional court to prevent 1 from reviewing the government's acts, and reestablished the \" eat penalty. These decrees were generally enforced only against the Soctf Democrats and not against either the Nazis or the Heimwehr, wn were reducing the country to chaos. When the Socialist mayor ° Vienna disbanded the Heimwehr unit of that city, he was at one overruled by Dollfuss. In May the Christian Socialist Party conference failed to elect D° \" fuss as head of the party. He at once announced that parliament won never be restored and that all political parties would be absorbe gradually into a single new partv, the \"Fatherland Front.\" From tins time on, Dollfuss and his successor Schuschnigg worked little by I'\" e to build up a personal dictatorship. This was not easy, as the error was opposed by the Social Democrats (who insisted on a rcstoratio of the constitution), by the Pan-Germans and their Nazi successor (who wanted union with Hitler's Germany), and by the Heimwehr (who were supported by Italy and wanted a Fascist state to domina the Danube area). While Dollfuss continued his attacks on the workers, the Na zl began to attack him and the Heimwehr. The Nazi movement in Aus- tria was under direct orders from Germany and was financed fr° n there. It engaged in wholesale attacks, parades, bombings, and murde - ous assaults on the government's supporters.

On June 19 Dollfuss outlawed the Nazis, arrested their leaders, and deponed Hitler's \"Inspector General for Austria.\" The Nazi Party went underground but continued its outrages, especially hundreds of bombings and thousands of acts of vandalism. In June 1933 they tried to murder Steidle and Rintelen, and in October tlle y succeeded in wounding Dollfuss. In the face of these Nazi atrocities, Dollfuss continued his methodical e struction of the Socialists. Since 1930, and probably since 1927, Mus- s °uni had been arming Hungary and the Heimwehr in Austria. The ° c ial Democrats, supported by Czechoslovakia and France, opposed uis. In January 1933, the Socialist railway union revealed that a, train- id of 50,000 rifles and 200 machine guns was en route from Mussolini 0 the Heimwehr and to Hungary. In the resulting controversy a joint nglo-French note protesting this violation of the peace treaties and fuering the arms to be either returned to Italy or destroyed was re- acted by Dollfuss. Instead, Dollfuss made an agreement with Mussolini ,° r support against the Nazis through the Heimwehr and for destroy- ing the Socialists in Austria. In March 1933, Dollfuss outlawed the e publican Defense Corps, the militia of the Socialist party, took the eumvehr into his Cabinet, and ended Parliament. J) ecause the continued agitations of the Nazis in 1933 made necessary ore support for Dollfuss from Mussolini and the Heimwehr, the gov- unient began to take steps to abolish the Socialist movement com- F e tely.

A new constitution was declared, under the emergency econoffl decree power of 1917, on April 24, 1934. It changed Austria fr 0,T1 \"democratic republic\" to a \"Christian, German, corporative, redely state.\" This constitution was both fraudulent and illegal, and Dolli us efforts to make it more legal, if not less fraudulent, had the oppo sl result. Dollfuss had signed a concordant with the Vatican in June i933' Since the Holv See wanted this agreement to be approved by P arl ment, DolJfuss decided to kill several birds with one stone by convo ing a rump of the old Parliament to accept this document, to terrnin 3 the disrupted sesssion of March 4, 1933, and to accept the 471 deer he had issued since that date. Among these decrees was the new co stitution of 1934. Since the government insisted that the old constitute had never been suspended or even violated, the new one had to accepted either by a plebiscite or by a two-thirds vote of the old \"ar ' ment with at least half its members present. This was done on A P 30, 1934, the various acts being accepted by a fraction of the Parliament. Because the Socialists were prevented from attending, a the Pan-Germans refused to attend, only 76 out of 165 were pr ese and some of these voted against the acts proposed. The new constitution was of no importance because the govc£' con- :'S ment continued to rule by decree, and violated it as it pleased- example, a decree of June 19, 1934, deprived the courts of their stitutional power to rule on the constitutionality of all the governm acts before July 1, 1934.    ,    The corporative aspect of the new constitution was a complete » In many activities no corporations were set up; where they were se r members were appointed and not elected as provided in law; an 0 any case, they did nothing.

This left most of the loss unexplained. It remained unex- Pained to the end. Legal proceedings were begun against twenty-seven Persons, but the Schuschnigg government never brought any of them to trial. mis corruption spread through the government until finally a point as reached where, as Starhemberg put it, \"No one knew whom he u 'd trust, and there was justification for habouring the most amazing ' s picions.\" Outrages by the Nazis increased in Mav and June 1934, to point where bombings were averaging fifteen a day.

In this way the violent Tavs Plan of the Austrian Naz> s was replaced by the Keppler Plan of peaceful and gradual penetration through Papen and the Austrian politician Artur von Seyss-Inquart. The invasion of Austria as early as March 12, 1938, and the immediate annexation of Austria were a pleasant surprise, even for the Nazi leaders in Germany, and arose from several unexpectedly favorable circum- stances. Accordingly, the decision to invade was not made before March 10, 1938, and even then was conditional, while the decision to annex was not made until noon on March 12 th by Hitler personally and was unknown to both Ribbentrop and Goring as late as 10:30 P- iV '• on March 12th. The circumstances which brought this unexpecte speedup in the German plans were based on two facts: (1) the inter- national situation and (2) the events in Austria. We shall discuss thes in order. As far as obvious political events are concerned, 1937 was the only quiet year after 1933. But the capture and release of various seer documents now make it clear that 1937 was a critical turning P 01 because in that year the German government and the British govern ment made secret decisions which sealed the fate of Austria and Czecn Slovakia and dominated the history of the next three years. The decision made bv the German government (that is, by Hit / was to prepare for open military aggression against Czechoslova and Austria and to carry this out before 1943-1945, probably in '93 This decision was announced by Hitler to a secret meeting of se v persons on November 5, 1937. Among those present, besides Hi and his aide, Colonel Hossback, were the minister of war (We von Blomberg), the commanders in chief of the army (Werner Fritsch), the navy (Erich Raeder), and the air force (Hermann ing), and the foreign minister (Konstantin von Neurath). It is eV1 from some of Hitler's statements that he had already received cer information about the secret decisions being made by Chamberlai the British side; for example, he said flatly that Britain wante satisfy the colonial ambitions of Germany by giving it non-Britisn Clia\" 1 \" like Portuguese Angola, something which we now know was in berlain's mind. Hitler further assured his listeners that \"almost cert Britain, and probably France as well, had already tacitly writte ^ the Czechs and were reconciled to the fact that this question wou cleared up in due course bv Germany. ... An attack by France out British support, and with the prospect of the offensive being or s to a standstill on our western fortifications, was hardly probable, was a French march through Belgium and Holland without support to be expected.\"    , c na jn, Hitler thought that, by reducing German support for Franco W P the war there could be extended, and, by encouraging Italy t0"},{"pageNumber":634,"pageContent":"THE DISRUPTION OF EUROPE, 1937-1939 619 n Spain, especially in the Balearic Islands, the French African troops °Wd be kept from crossing the Mediterranean Sea for use in Europe, M A*** S enera l t ' iat France and Britain would be so tied down in the editerranean by Italy that they would take no action against Germany e r Czechoslovakia and Austria. In fact, Hitler was so sure of an Anglo- euch war against Italy in 1938 that he was confident Czechoslovakia Austria could be conquered by Germany in that year. *hese ideas were completely unacceptable to Blomberg, Fritsch, and eurath. They objected that German rearmament was so backward at they did not have a single motorized division capable of move- . en t, that there was no reason to expect an Anglo-French-Italian war J938, that Italy, in such a war, could tie down only twenty French Visions, leaving more than enough to attack Germany, and that such attack would be very dangerous because Germany's fortifications on er Western frontier were \"insignificant.\" Hitler brushed these objec- ts aside. He \"repeated his previous statements that he was convinced Britain's non-participation, and, therefore, he did not believe in the P obability of belligerent action by France against Germany.\" . A s a result of the opposition from Blomberg, Fritsch, and Neurath wis conference of November 1937, Hitler replaced these three by 0r e amenable subordinates in a sudden coup on February 4, 1938. . er himself took the posts of minister of war and commander in r 11 ^ with General Wilhelm Keitel as chief of staff for all the armed , rces °f the Reich. Neurath was replaced in the Foreign Ministry by e fanatical Ribbentrop. The very able Dirksen was sent to London as oassador, but his ability was wasted, as Ribbentrop paid no attention us reports and his well-founded warnings. n the meantime the British government, especially the small group trolling foreign policy, had reached a seven-point decision regard- g their attitude toward Germany: • Hitler Germany was the front-line bulwark against the spread of ^mmunism in Europe. cl A ^ 0ur ~P° wer pact of Britain, France, Italy, and Germany to ex- . e all Russian influence from Europe was the ultimate aim; accord- 8 > r i Britain had no desire to weaken the Rome-Berlin Axis, but garded it and the Anglo-French Entente as the foundation of a stable Europe. 3- Britain had no objection to German acquisition of Austria, Czecho- Slov akia, and Danzig. t L.

Britain would use pressure on Czechoslovakia and Poland to nego tiate with Germany and to be conciliatory to Germany's desires. To these seven points we should add an eighth: Britain must rear in order to maintain its position in a \"three-bloc world\" and to d e Germany from using force in creating its bloc in Europe. This p 01 was supported bv Chamberlain, who built up the air force which say Britain in 1940, and by the Round Table Group led by Lord Lothian. Edward Grigg, and Leopold Amery, who put on a campaign to estaWi compulsory military service. The first seven points were reiterated to Germany by various spoK men from 1937 onward.

Bv the spring of 1938 this com pletely erroneous view of the situation was being propagated bv the government itself- For years before June 1938, the government insisted that British FC\" arming was progressing in a satisfactory fashion. Churchill and others questioned this, and produced figures on German rearmament to prove that Britain's own progress in this field was inadequate. These figures (which were not correct) were denied by the government, and theU\" own rearmament defended. As late as March 1938, Chamberlain SiV that British armament were such as to make Britain an \"almost terrify\" 1 ^ power ... on the opinion of the world.\" But, as the year went on, me government adopted a quite different attitude. In order to persuade pu )_ lie opinion that it was necessarv to yield to Germany, the governmen and its supporters pretended that its armaments were quite inadequate in comparison with Germanv. We now know, thanks to the captured papers of the German Mm ,s ' try of War, that this was a gross exaggeration. From 1936 to the ou break of war in 1939, German aircraft production was not raised, averaged 425 planes a month of all types (including commercial)- tank production was low, and even in 1939 was less than Britain's, m r first nine months of 1939 Germanv produced only 50 tanks a month; the last four months of 1939, in wartime, Germanv produced 247 ta and self-propelled guns,\" compared to British production of 3'4 ta in the same period. At the time of the Munich Crisis in 1938, Germa had 35 infantry and 4 motorized divisions none of them fully man' or equipped. At that time Czechoslovakia could mobilize at least 33 d1 sions. Moreover, the Czech Army was better trained, had far be . equipment, and had better morale and better fortifications. At that Germany's tanks were all below 10 tons and were armed with mac guns, except for a handful of 18-ton tanks (Mark III) armed wi 37-mm. gun. The Czechs had hundreds of 38-ton tanks armed with 7) mm. cannon. In March 1939, when Germany overran Czechoslova ^ • ^ captured 469 of these superior tanks along with 1,500 planes, 43, 000 chine guns, and over 1 million rifles.

In contrast with this, the British air program March 1934, which emphasized fighter planes, was to provide a first- torce of 900 planes. This was stepped up, under the urging of Cham- r a m, and the program of May 1938 was planned to provide a first-line Ce °f 2 >37° planes. This was raised again in 1939. Under it, Britain P °uuced almost 3,000 \"military\" planes in 1938 and about 8,000 in 1939 Spared to 3,350 \"combat\" planes produced in Germany in 1938 and ^•'733 in 1939. Moreover, the quality of British planes was superior to M of Gennany's. It was this margin which made it possible for Brit- to defeat Germany in the Battle of Britain in September 1940. rorn these facts it is quite clear that Britain did not yield to superior ce m 1938, as was stated at the time and has been stated since by many lt: ers, including Winston Churchill, whose war memoirs were written ° years after the Reichswehr archives were captured. We have evi- c e that the Chamberlain government knew these facts but consist- y gave a contrary impression and that Lord Halifax went so far in ls direction as to call forth protests from the British military attaches in ^ ra gue and Paris. n e Chamberlain government made it clear to Germany both publicly privately that they would not oppose Germany's projects.

It is worthy to note that no public demand was made by either Henlein or Germany to detach the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia until after Se Ptemb'er 12, 1938, although influential persons in the British govern- ment were advocating this, both in public and private, for months be- fof e this date. The Czech strength rested on its army of approximately thirty-three ^'visions, which was the best in Europe in quality, the excellent forti- fication system, and its alliances with France, the Soviet Union, and the -ittle Entente. The annexation of Austria surrounded Bohemia with German territory on three sides, but its position, from a military point of v iew, was still strong. A line drawn from Berlin to Vienna would Pass by Prague, but the German Army could not safely invade Bohemia across its weakly fortified southern frontier with Austria because of the danger of a Czech counterattack from its fortified base into Bavaria. . Witbj n two weeks of Hitler's annexation of Austria, Britain was mov- \"^ ^ w as decided to put pressure on the Czechs to make concessions to tlle Germans; to encourage France and eventually Germany to do the Si)n 'e; to insist that Germany must not use force to reach a decision, but '° have patience enough to allow negotiations to achieve the same result; and to exclude Russia' although it was allied to Czechoslovakia, from the Negotiations completely. All this was justified by the arguments that ^echoslovakia, in a war with Germany, would be smashed immediately, ^at Russia was of no military value whatever and would not honor its fiance with the Czechs anyway, and that Germany would be satisfied lf lf obtained the Sudetenland and the Polish Corridor.

The Counting horror of the relentless German mobilization was built up day } r day, while Britain and France ordered the Czechs not to mobilize in order \"not to provoke Germany.\" The word was assiduously spread on a '| sides that Russia was worthless and would not fight, that Britain cer- tainly would not go to war to prevent the Sudetens from exercising the e mocratic right of self-determination, that Germany could overwhelm le Czechs in a few days and could wipe out Prague, Paris, and London r °ni the air in the first day, that these air attacks would be accompanied . v gas attacks on the civilian population from the air, and that, even if ennany could be defeated after years of war, Czechoslovakia would ev er be reconstructed because it was an artificial monstrosity, an aberra- tl0n of i 9I0 .

Although General Maurice Gamelm< French commander in chief, gave a very encouraging report o Czech Army, and was quoted to this effect by Chamberlain in a <-> a meeting of September 26th, Halifax the next day quoted him as s V : that the Czech resistance would be of extremely brief duration. 1 ne itary attache in Prague protested about the statement in referen Czech morale, pointing out that it was made in reference to the rr . police, which were not military.

In general, every report or rumor which could add to the panic nd defeatism was played up, and everything that might contribute to a rong or a united resistance to Germany was played down.

They met on ptember 15th at Berchtesgaden. Chamberlain tried to reopen at once discussions toward a general Anglo-German settlement which Hali- had opened in November 1937, but which had been broken off since Vl 'e Henderson's conference with Hitler on March 3rd.

The way in which Chamberlain applied \"consultation with the Czechs before partition was imposed is an interesting example of his mind a work. The British, French, and Czechs were agreed in opposition to the use of a plebiscite in this dispute, although the Entente suggested it to put pressure on the Czechs. Chamberlain said: \"The idea of territorial cession would be likely to have a more favorable reception from the British public if it could be represented as the choice of the Czechoslovak Government themselves and it could be made clear that they had been offered the choice of a plebiscite or of territorial cession and had pre- ferred the latter. This would dispose of anv idea that we were ourselves carving up Czechoslovak territory.\" He felt it particularly important to show that the Czechoslovak government preferred cession because they were so definitely opposed to a plebiscite that they would fight rather than accept a plebiscite. This Anglo-French decision was presented to the Czechoslovak g oV \" ernment at 2:00 A.M. on September 19th, to be accepted at once. The terms leaked to the press in Paris the same day. After vigorous protests, the Czechoslovaks rejected the Anglo-French solution and appealed to the procedures of the German-Czechoslovak Arbitration Treaty of 19 26 ' The Czechs argued that they had not been consulted, that their consti- tution required that their Parliament be consulted, that partition would be ineffective in maintaining peace because the minorities would rise again, and that the balance of power in Europe would be destroyed- Benes refused to believe that new guarantees could be more effective, when Czechoslovakia would be weaker, than those which were now proving inadequate. London and Paris rejected the Czech refusal. Pres- sure was increased on the Czechs. The French threatened to revoke the French-Czechoslovak alliance and to abandon the whole country to Ger- many if the Anglo-French solution was not accepted. The British added that the Sudetenland would not be returned to Czechoslovakia even after a successful war against Germany. The British minister in Prague threat- ened to order all British subjects from the country if he did not receive an immediate acceptance. The Czechoslovak government accepted at 5:00 P.M. on September 21st. Lord Halifax at once ordered the Czec police to be withdrawn from the Sudeten districts, and expressed b» wish that the German troops move in at once.

After that, if the Czechs challenged his choice of a frontier, he would hold a plebiscite and prove how wrong they were. An international commission could supervise the vote. At any rate, he must nave the German areas before October 1st, for on that day the German lQ rces would move in, war or no war. At Chamberlain's request he em- bodied his demands in a memorandum which proved to be an ultimatum. I his ultimatum was at once carried to Prague to be presented to the Czechs by the British military attache. Back in London, the Cabinet agreed to reject the Godesberg Demands an d to support France if it had to go to war as a result. The French Cabinet also rejected these demands. So did a new Czech Cabinet under General Jan Svrovv. The Soviet Union explicitly recognized its com- \"utrnents to Czechoslovakia, and even promised to come to the aid of the Cc hs without the necessary preliminary action by France if the case ^ v ere submitted to the League of Nations (this was to prevent Britain a nd France from charging Russia with aggression in any action it might ^ke in behalf of Czechoslovakia). On the same day (September 23rd) Russia warned Poland that it would denounce their Nonaggression reaty if Poland attacked Czechoslovakia. Apparently a united front had been formed against Hitler's aggres- °n—but only apparently. Mr. Chamberlain was already beginning to n dermine the unity and resolution of this front, and he now received °nsiderable assistance from Bonnet in Paris. This culminated on Sep- mber 27th when he made a speech on the radio in which he said, \"How rnble, fantastic, incredible it is that we should be digging trenches trying on gas masks here because of a quarrel in a far-away country tWeen people of whom we know nothing ... a quarrel that has al- ay been settled in principle. . . .\" The same day he sent a telegram to f i? eS . t * lat 'f ne did not accept the German demands by 2:00 P.M. the owing day (September 28th) Czechoslovakia would be overrun by German Army, and nothing could save it.

The conference lasted from 12:30 P.M. on September 29th to 2:30 A.M. when the agreement of the four Powers was handed to the Czech minister m Berlin, who had been waiting outside the door for over ten hours. The agreement reached Prague only eighteen hours before the German occu- pation was to begin. The Munich agreement provided that certain designated areas 01 Czechoslovakia would be occupied by the German Army in four stages from October 1st to October 7th. A fifth area, to be designated by an international commission, would be occupied by October 10th. No prop- erty was to be withdrawn from these areas. The international commis- sion would order plebiscites which must be held before the end of No- vember, the areas designated being occupied by an international force during the interval. The same international commission was to supervise the occupation and draw the final frontier. For six months the popula- tions concerned would have the right of option into and out of the area transferred under the supervision of a German-Czechoslovak commissio' 1 - The rump of Czechoslovakia was to be guaranteed by France and Br'- ain.

The Munich agreement was violated on everv point in favor or \" many, so that ultimately the German Army merely occupied the p' a it wanted. As a result, the Czech economic system was destroyed, a every important railroad or highway was cut or crippled.

This reluctance for war against Poland did not arise °m any affection for peace but from the fact that he had not made up s rnind whether to attack France or Poland. He was inclined at first attack westward, and did not change his mind and decide to deal first ' Poland until April 1, 1939. The plans to attack France and the Low u ntries soon were reported to London and Paris and had a good deal 0 with building up the war spirit in those areas. n addition, Italian demands for territorial concessions from France in °vember 1938 aroused the fighting spirit of that country from the el to which it had sagged in September.

The fight- ing spirits of the French people were revived by being threatened by such a weak Power as Italy, and Bonnet was driven to a new appease- ment of Germany. On December 6th Ribbentrop came to Paris, signed a treaty of friendship and neutrality, and opened a series of economic discussions. On this occasion the German foreign minister received from bonnet the impression that France would give Germany a free hand in eastern Europe. French fears that Britain would seek to detach Mussolini irom Hitler by making concessions to Italy at the expense of France did not end until February i 939 , an d reached their peak in January, when Chamberlain and Halifax made a formal visit to Rome to recognize the King of Italy as Emperor of Ethiopia.

He and Ribbentrop were outraged that they had been cheated out of a war in September, and immediately made up their minds to wipe the rest of Czechoslovakia off the map as soon as possible and proceed to a war. The next time, said Hitler, he hoped no \"dirty pig\" would suggest a conference. Orders to plan an invasion of the rump of Czechoslovakia were is- sued on October zist, as we have said. Keitel's plans, presented on De- cember i 7 th, provided that the task would be done by the peacetime army without mobilization. Any possibility of opposition from Britain or Prance was effectively disposed of by Lord Halifax's insistence that the guarantee to Czechoslovakia be worded so as to be binding on all tour of the Munich Powers jointly (or at least on three of them) and would not be accepted by Britain if worded in such a way as to bind the signers individually. This made any guarantee meaningless, and this distasteful project was indefinitely postponed by a German\"note to Lord Halifax on March 3, I939 .

They hoped in this way to block Germany's movement to tllc east and to keep Russian influence out of central Europe. Within tlle two autonomous provinces, Slovakia and Ruthenia, and to a much Jesser degree in Bohemia-Moravia, there was turmoil as various reac- 'onary and semi-Fascist groups angled for power and German favor. The degree of political maturity in Slovakia may be judged from the ta ct that the members of Monsignor Tiso's Cabinet personally took bombs from the Nazis to stir up trouble in their own province. Their e ttorts to break away from Prague completely were hampered by the financial insolvency of Slovakia. When they appealed to Prague for financial assistance on March 9, 1939, President Hacha deposed the vak premier and three of his ministers. Seyss-Inquart, accompanied by ev eral German generals, forced the Slovak Cabinet to issue a declara- >°n of independence from Prague. Tiso, summoned to Hitler's presence Berlin on March 13th, was \"persuaded\" to approve this action. The e claration was received with profound apathy by the Slovak people, nough the German radio filled the air with stories of riots and dis- tances, and various Nazi bands within both Slovakia and Bohemia ld their best to make the facts fit this description. u n March 14th, Hacha, the president of Czechoslovakia, was forced go to Berlin.

Thus, from March onward, it became almost impossible to sell appeasement to the public, especially' to the British public, who were sufficiently sturdy and sensible to know when they had had enough. But the British public and the British government were two different things, and it is quite untrue to sav that the latter learned Hitler's real ambitions in March 1939 and determined to oppose them. Above all, lC is completely wrong to sav this of Chamberlain, who, more and more, was running foreign policy as his own personal business. Hitler's real ambitions were quite clear to most men in the government even before Munich, and were made evident to the rest during that crisis, especially by the way in which the German High Command seized hundreds oj villages in Czechoslovakia with overwhelming Czech populations and only small German minorities, and did so for strategic and economic reasons in the period October 1-10, 1938. But for the members of the government, the real turning point took place in January 1939, when British diplomatic agents in Europe began to bombard London Wit rumors of a forthcoming attack on the Netherlands and France. At that moment, appeasement in the strict sense ceased. To the government tn seizure of Czechoslovakia in March was of little significance except for the shock it gave to British opinion. The government had already writ- ten off the rump of Czechoslovakia completely, a fact which is clear a. much from their direct statements as by their refusal to guarantee tfta rump, and the attention given to other matters even when the seizur was known (as it was after March nth). For example, Lord Hal* 1 * sent President Roosevelt a long letter analyzing the international situa- tion on January 24th; it is completely realistic about Hitler's outlook a projects, but Czechoslovakia is not mentioned; neither is appeasement. Nevertheless, concessions to Germany continued. But now para with concessions went a real effort to build up a strong front again Hitler for the day when concessions would break down. Moreover, c° cessions were different after March 17th because now they had to secret. They had to be secret because public opinion refused any l° n & to accept any actions resembling appeasement, but they were continu for several reasons. In the first place British rearmament was slow, a concessions were given to win time. In the second place the projects the anti-Bolsheviks and \"three-bloc-world\" supporters demanded c tinued concessions. In the third place, Chamberlain continued to w to achieve his seven-point settlement with Hitler in the hope that could suddenly present it to the British electorate as a prelude triumphant General Election which he planned for the winter of i93°\"~ 1940.

The projects of the anti-Bolsheviks and the \"three-bloc-world\" sup- porters were too dangerous to admit publiclv. but thev were sufficiently well known in Berlin to lead to the belief, even in moderate circles, that \"Wain would never go to war for Poland. For example, Weizsacker, 'he German secretary of state, chided Nevile Henderson in June 1939 *°r abandoning his often-repeated statement that ''England desired to re- tain the sea; the European Continent could be left to Germany.\" How- ler, these two groups, although still active in 1939, and even in 1940, \"ad not originally envisaged the complete destruction of Czechoslovakia or Poland. Thev had expected that Hitler would get the Sudentenland, 'Janzig^ ana ; p erna ps the Polish Corridor and that he would then be stabilized between the \"oceanic bloc\" and the Soviet Union, with contact With the latter across the Baltic States. It was expected that a rump Czechoslovakia and a rump Poland would be able to survive between Germany and Russia, as Holland or Switzerland could survive between tn e oceanic bloc and Germany. Moreover, the \"three-bloc-world\" sup- Porters never wanted Hitler to drive southward either to the Adriatic or to the Aegean. Accordingly, although divided in respect to Romania and the Black Sea, they were determined to support Turkey and Greece a gainst both Germany' and Italy. As a consequence of these hidden and conflicting forces, the history of ln ternational relations from September 1938 to September 1939 or even at er is neither simple nor consistent. In general, the key to everything Was the position of Britain, for the aims of the other countries concerned Were relatively simple. As a result of the dualistic or, as Lord Halifax's Dlo grapher calls it, \"dvarchic\" policy of Britain, there were not only Wo policies but two groups carrying them out. The Foreign Office un- der Lord Halifax tried to satisfy the public demand for an end to ap- peasement and the construction of a united front against Germany. Chamberlain with his own personal group, including Sir Horace Wilson, lr John Simon, and Sir Samuel Hoare, sought to make secret conces- sions to Hitler in order to achieve a general Anglo-German settlement on the basis of the seven points. The one policy was public; the other M 'as secret. Since the Foreign Office knew of both, it tried to build up le \"peace front\" against Germany so that it would look sufficiently lrn posing to satisfv public opinion in England and to drive Hitler to See k his desires by negotiation rather than by force so that public opinion h England would not force the government to declare a war that they •d not want in order to remain in office.

Above all, these involved maneuvers drov e the Soviet Union into the arms of Hitler. This complex scheme meant that the British government accept the events of March 15th except for feeble protests. These were &\" rected less against the deed itself than against the risk of agitating publie opinion by the deed. On .March 15th Chamberlain told the Commons that he accepted the seizure of Czechoslovakia, and refused to accus Hitler of bad faith. But two days later, when the howls of rage u° m the British public showed that he had misjudged the electorate, went to his constituency in Birmingham on March 17th and denounce the seizure. However, nothing was done except to recall Henucrso from Berlin \"for consultations\" and cancel a visit to Berlin by r president of the Board of Trade planned for March 17-20. The seizui was declared illegal but was recognized in fact at once, and erro were made to recognize it in law by establishing a British consul* general accredited to Germany at Prague. Moreover, .£6,000,000 1 Czech gold reserves in London were turned over to Germany wl the puny, and untrue, excuse that the British government could no give orders to the Bank of England (May 1939). The German acquisition of the Czech gold in London was but 0 episode in an extensive, and largely secret, plan for economic conce sions to Germany. For Chamberlain and his friends, the Czechoslova crisis of March 1939 was merely an annoying interruption to the efforts to make a general agreement with Germany in terms or seven points we have already mentioned. These efforts had been int rupted after March 3, 1938 by the Czechoslovak crisis of that y e ' but they remained the chief item in Chamberlain's plans, and he tr to get Hitler to discuss these projects when the two leaders came ra to face on September 15th at Berchtesgaden. Hitler interrupted, a turned the discussion at once to the crisis. Again, after the Muni agreement was signed on September 30th, Chamberlain tried to g Der Fiihrer to discuss a general settlement, but he was evaded, process was continued for a year, Chamberlain and his friends prop ing concessions and Hitler either evading or ignoring them. There y a slight change, however, after September 1938: Chamberlain's proj eC was widened to include economic concessions, and the efforts achieve it became increasingly secret, especially after the events March 1939. After September, 1938, the seven-point project was broadencu ; adding an eighth point: economic support for Germany, especially exploiting eastern Europe.

Goring, as commissioner of the Four- ea r Economic Plan, presented these facts at a secret conference on etober 14, 19^8. In the course of his speech he spoke roughly as follows; I am faced with unheard-of difficulties. The Treasury is empty; in- ustrial capacity is crammed with orders for many years.

On the contrary, the 1Sn government, through the Federation of British Industries, began negotiate with Germany to create a complete system of industrial peration, with cartels dividing the world's markets and fixing prices ( oy er fifty industrial groups.

This, he felt, \"implies though it does not necessitate, some lim> ta ' tion of the armaments race; secondly, it means that Germany must loo* towards the United Kingdom for assistance or cooperation in the eco- nomic sphere.\" He listed the concessions that the Germans wante . and concluded, \"We should not ignore the possibilities of a more peace- ful development; and we should not put Hitler in a position to say that once again he made an offer of cooperation to England and tna that offer was pushed aside.\" Accordingly, the discussions continue and the British government announced that the president of the Boar of Trade, Oliver Stanley, would go to Berlin on March 17th.

He said: \"Certain consultations are now proceeding with on governments.

The British government su 1918 had resolutely refused any bilateral agreement guaranteeing a J state in western Europe. Now thev were making a unilateral declarati in which they obtained nothing but in which they guaranteed a sW ^ in eastern Europe, and thev were giving that state the responsible. of deciding when that guarantee would take effect, something <l u unprecedented. A little thought will show that all these strange ieatn really stultify the guarantee, and the net result was to leave the situati exactly where it had been before, except that a very severe warm 1 b had been conveyed in this fashion to Germany to use negotiation a not force. If Germany used force against Poland, public opinion V Britain would force Britain to declare war whether there was a guar 3 tee or not.     ,     The fact that Chamberlain's guarantee was temporary and unilate left the British free to cancel it when necessary. The fact that it g ua anteed Poland's \"independence\" and not its territorial integrity left_ way open for Germany to get Danzig or the Corridor by negotiat 10 ' and the fact that it came into effect when Poland wished made impossible for Britain or British public opinion to refuse to accept a y change which Poland worked out in negotiation with Hitler.

He also announced the terms he had offered Poland which had been rejected. As a result, negotiations broke °ff between the two Powers and were never really resumed. Instead, \" e crisis was intensified by provocative acts on both sides. On May 22 a German-Italian alliance was signed, the \"Pact of ^teel,\" as Mussolini called it. Here, again, the wording was important. ' was a clearly aggressive alliance, since the parties promised to sup- Port each other, not against \"unprovoked attack,\" as was customary, Dut in all cases. At the signing, Germany was told flatly that Italy could not make war before 1943 and that the approaching war would e a \"war of exhaustion.\" The very next day, May 23, 1939, Hitler d a secret conference with his generals. In the course of a lengthy s Peech he said: uanzig is not the subject of this dispute at all. It is a question of •panding our living space in the East and of securing our food sup- P le s, and the settlement of the Baltic problems. Food supplies can be pected only from thinly populated areas. Over and above the natural ttuity, thoroughgoing German exploitation will increase production ° rrr >ously. There is no other possibility in Europe. Beware of gifts of onial territory. These do not solve the food problem. Remember— ockade.

There will be th 'A •* ^ ls to ' so ' ate Poland. The success of this isolation will be ecisive factor. Therefore, the Fiihrer must reserve the decision to V h a * orc ^ er to att ack.

Worse than this, no military agreements were made as to how' Britain and Poland would cooperate in war. A British military mission did manage to get to Warsaw on Julv 19th, but it did nothing. Further- more, economic support to rearm Poland was given late, in inadequate amounts, and in an unworkable form. There was talk of a British loan to Poland of ^100 million in May; on August 1st Poland finally got a credit for $8,163,300 at a time when all London was buzzing about a secret loan of /1,000,000,000 from Britain to Germany. The effects of such actions on Germany can be seen in the minutes of a secret conference between Hitler and his generals held on August 22nd. The Fiihrer said: \"The following is characteristic of England- Poland wanted a loan from England for rearmament. England, how- ever, gave only a credit to make sure that Poland buys in England although England cannot deliver. This means that England does not really want to support Poland.\" Perhaps even more surprising is the fact that France, which na had an alliance with Poland since 1921, had no military conversations with Poland after 1925, except that in August 1936 Poland was g iven 2,000,000,000 francs as a rearmament loan (Rambouillet Agreenien )< and on May 19, 1939, the Polish minister of war signed an agreement 1 Paris by which Franee promised full air support to Poland on the n dav of war, local skirmishing by the third day, and a full-scale offensiv on the sixteenth day. On August 23rd General Gamelin informed 1 government that no military support could be given to Poland in event of war until the spring of 1940 and that a full-scale offensive coU not be made by France before 1941—1942. Poland was never inform of this change, and seems to have entered the war on September in the belief that a full-scale offensive would be made against Genua y in the west during September.    j    The failure to support Poland by binding political, economic, a military obligations in the period before August 23rd was probably liberate, in the hope that this would force Poland to negotiate u Hitler. If so, it was a complete failure. Poland was so encouraged by British guarantee that it not only refused to make concessions but prevented the reopening of negotiations by one excuse after ano until the last day of peace. This was quite agreeable to Hitler ' Ribbentrop. When Count Ciano, the Italian foreign minister, ^ had been kept completely in the dark by the Germans, visited R> } trop on August 1 ith he asked his host: \"What do you want? The Cor"},{"pageNumber":666,"pageContent":"THE DISRUPTION OF EUROPE, I937-I939 651 or Danzig? . . . 'Not any longer.' And he fixed on me those cold . . . e yes of his. 'We want war.'\" Ciano was shocked, and spent two days /ymg, quite vainly, to persuade Ribbentrop and Hitler that war was \"\"possible for several vears. In the light of these facts the British efforts to reach a settlement With Hitler, and their reluctance to make an alliance with Russia, were Ve ry unrealistic. Nevertheless, thev continued to exhort the Poles to eo pen negotiations with Hitler, and continued to inform the German government that the justice of their claims to Danzig and the Corridor Were recognized but that these claims must be fulfilled by peaceful e ans and that force would be inevitably be met by force. On the her hand, they argued, a German agreement to use negotiation would timately bring them the possibility of a disarmament agreement, onial acquisitions, and economic concessions in a settlement with England. *he same point of view had been clearly put by Lord Halifax at natham House on June 29th. The key was \"no use of force, but gotiations,\" then a chance to settle \"the colonial problem, the questions raw materials, trade barriers, Lebensrauvi, the limitations of arma- ent s, and other issues. This emphasis on methods, with the accom- panying neglect of the balance of power, the rights of small nations, or e danger of German hegemony in Europe, was maintained throughout, oreover, the British continued to emphasize that the controversy was er Danzig, when everyone else knew that Danzig was merely a detail, an almost indefensible detail. The real issue was Germany's plan to troy Poland as one more step on the way to the complete domination of Europe. Uanzig was no issue on which to right a world war, but it was an e on which negotiation was almost mandatory. This mav have en why Britain insisted that it was the chief issue. But because it , as not the chief issue, Poland refused to negotiate because it feared a « negotiation began it would lead to another Munich in which the Powers would join together to partition Poland. Danzig was a r r issue for a war because it was a free city under the supervision of League of Nations, and, while it was within the Polish customs under Polish economic control, it was alreadv controlled politically • le l°cal Nazi Partv under a German Gauleiter, and would at any °nient vote to join Germany if Hitler consented. 11 tne midst of all these confusions, the British opened negotiations pt Russia to join the \"Peace Front.\" Although the documents r uably never will be published on the Soviet side, the course of the cussions is fairly clear. Both sides thoroughly distrusted each other, it is highly doubtful if either wanted an agreement except on s which were unacceptable to the other. Chamberlain was very"},{"pageNumber":667,"pageContent":"6?2  TRAGEDY AND HOPE anti-Bolshevik, and the Russians, who had seen him perform in regal\" to Ethiopia, Spain, and Czechoslovakia, were not convinced that had finally decided to stand up to Hitler. In fact, he had not. A f e words on this last point are relevant here. We have mentioned that the economic discussions between Bntai and Germany, which were publicly broken off on March 28th, we secretly reopened five days later. We do not know what became these, but, about July 20th, Helmuth Wohlthat, Reich commissioner for the Four-Year Plan, who was in London at an international W\" a ing conference, was approached with an amazing proposition by R ' Hudson, secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade. Altnoug Wohlthat had no powers, he listened to Hudson and later to Sir Hora Wilson, Chamberlain's personal representative, but rejected their sug gestion that he meet Chamberlain. Wilson offered (1) a nonaggressio pact with Germany, (2) a delimitation of spheres of interest, (3) colon concessions in Africa along the lines already mentioned, (4) an econo agreement, and (5) a disarmament agreement. One sentence of Din^ report on this matter is significant. It says, \"Sir Horace Wilson de itelv told Herr W r ohlthat that the conclusion of a nonaggression p> H would enable Britain to rid herself of her commitments vis-a-vis Polan • That Chamberlain wanted a nonaggression pact with Germany stated by him publicly on May 3rd, only five days after Hitler denounc his nonaggression pact with Poland. Dirksen's report of July 21st continued: \"Sir Horace Wilson fu rt said that it was contemplated holding new elections in Britain this tumn. From the point of view of purely domestic political tactic , was all one to the Government whether the elections were held undd the cry 'Be Ready for a Coming War!' or under the cry 'A LastlI !j Understanding with Germany in Prospect and Achievable!' I 1 c0 obtain the backing of the electors for either of these cries and assxiT v rule for another five years. Naturally, it preferred the peaceful cry- News of these negotiations leaked out, apparently from the r f who wished to break them off, but the rumor was that the discussi were concerned with Chamberlain's efforts to give Germany a loa ;£ 1,000,000,000. This is not supported by the documents. This ou ) however, made it difficult to carry on the discussions, especially as 1 and Ribbentrop were not interested. But Chamberlain kept Lord K man busy training to be the chief economic negotiator in the g rea . s tlement he envisaged. On July 29th, Kordt, the German charge d'arrai in London, had a long talk with Charles Roden Buxton, acting, » e lieved, on behalf of Chamberlain. It was along the same lines. These 0 were repeated in a highly secret conversation between Dirksen an\" son in the latter's residence on August 3rd.

Dirksen's record of this conversa- tion then reads: \"After recapitulating his conversation with Wohlthat, Sir Horace Wil- son expatiated at length on the great risk Chamberlain would incur by starting confidential negotiations with the German government. If any- tni ng about them were to leak out, there would be a grand scandal and ^amberlain would probably be forced to resign.\" Dirksen did not see 10 W any binding agreement could be reached under conditions such as t ni s, \"for example, owing to Hudson's indiscretion, another visit of Herr Wohlthat to London was out of the question.\" To this, Wilson suggested nat \"the two emissaries could meet in Switzerland or elsewhere.\" It ' as pointed out by Wilson that if Britain could get a nonaggression pact ith Germany, it would adopt a nonintervention policy in respect to reater Germany. This would embrace the Danzig question, for ex- ample. « is clear that these negotiations were not a purely personal policy Chamberlain's but were known to the Foreign Office. For example, t* August 9th Lord Halifax repeated much of the political portion of e se conversations. After Munich, he said, he had looked forward to . ty years of peace, with \"Germany the dominant power on the con- e nt, with predominant rights in southeastern Europe, particularly in e held of commercial policy; Britain would engage only in moderate °- e in that area; in Western Europe, Britain and France protected from lets with Germany by the lines of fortification on both sides and eavoring to retain and develop their possessions by defensive means; ndship with America; friendship with Portugal; Spain for the time ein g an indefinite factor which for the next few years at least would have to hold aloof from all combinations of powers; Russia out-of-the-way, vast and scarcely surveyable territory; Britain bent ' e § Uar ding her Mediterranean communications with the dominions the Far East.\" This was \"three-bloc-world\" talk straight from All b0 *ls College or Cliveden. Was almost impossible to keep negotiations such as these, or rather Posed negotiations, secret. There can be no doubt that rumors about eie reac ' le d the Russians in July 1939 and, by strengthening their an- ^• , suspicions of Britain, made them decide to avoid any agreement -j, ntain and to take instead the nonaggression pact offered by Hitler.

Obviously, such an alliance could be aimed only at Russia. The relevant portion of his report to Lord Halifax reads: \"At the end Herr von Ribbentrop asked me whether I could gu« ir \" antee that the Prime Minister could carry the country with him i° 3 policy of friendship with Germany. I said there was no possible doubt whatever that he could and would, provided Germany cooperated WJH| him. Herr Hitler asked whether England would be willing to accept an alliance with Germany.

Even now, after hundreds of volumes and thousands of documents have been published, many points are not clear, and interpretations of ni erous events are hotly disputed. The magnitude of the war itself P,°uld contribute to such disputes. It lasted exactly six years, from the e rrnan invasion of Poland on September i, 1939 to the Japanese sur- fer on September 2, 1945. During that period it was fought on every nt 'nent and on every sea, in the heights of the atmosphere and be- 1 the surface of the ocean, and fought with such destruction of prop- yl and lives as had never been witnessed before. i he total nature of the Second World War can be seen from the fact at deaths of civilians exceeded deaths of combatants and that many of Were killed without any military justification, as victims of sheer ls m and brutality, largely through cold-blooded savagery by Ger- ns > and, to a lesser extent, by Japanese and Russians, although British ... American attacks from the air on civilian populations and on non- 1 itary targets contributed to the total. The distinctions between civil- s and military personnel and between neutrals and combatants, which . a been blurred in the First World War, were almost completely lost 1... second. This is clear from a few figures. The number of civilians e d reached 17 millions, of which 5,400,000 were Polish; while Poland 'ess than 100,000 soldiers killed or missing in the Battle of Poland in 939, Polish civilians to the number of 3,900,000 were executed, or mur- e ^d in the ghetto, subsequently. ne armies which began to move in September 1939 had no new a Pons which had not been possessed by the armies of 1918.

These defensive weapons 661"},{"pageNumber":677,"pageContent":"662  TRAGEDY AND HOPE included antitank guns, antiaircraft guns with controlled fire, minefields, mobile artillery on caterpillar tracks, trenches, and defense in depth. Germany used the offensive weapons we have mentioned in the new fashion, while Poland in 1939, Norway, the Low Countries, and France in 1940, the Balkan countries and the Soviet Union in 1941 did not use the available defensive tactics properly. As a result, Hitler advanced from one astounding victory to another. In the course of 1942 and 1943* neW weapons created by democratic science and new tactics learned in R us \" sia, in North Africa, and on the oceans of the world made it possible to stop the authoritarian advance and to reverse the direction of the tide. In 1944 and 1945 the returning tide of Anglo-American and Soviet power overwhelmed Italy, Germany, and Japan with the superior quality an the superior quantities of their equipment and men. Thus the war di- vides itself, quite naturally, into three parts: (1) the Axis advance cov- ering 1939, '94°< an d 1941; (2) the balance of forces in 1942; and (3) tn Axis retreat in 1943, 1944, and 1945. The Germans were able to advance in the period 1939-1941 becaus they had sufficient military resources, and used them in an effective way- The chief reason they had sufficient military resources was not based, is so often believed, on the fact that Germany was highly mobilized t war, but on other factors. In the first place, Hitler's economic revo s tion in Germany had reduced financial considerations to a point wn they played no role in economic or political decisions. When decisio were made, on other grounds, money was provided, through comple ; ^ Fn2f- unorthodox methods of finance, to carry them out. In France ana c.• a land, on the other hand, orthodox financial principles, especially anced budgets and stable exchange rates, played a major role in al cisions and was one of the chief reasons why these countries di mobilize in March 1936 or in September 1938 or why, having m °P in 1939 and 1940, they had totally inadequate numbers of airp tanks, antitank guns, and motorized transportation. There was another reason for the military inadequacy of the W e Powers in 1939. This, of even greater significance than the influenc orthodox finance, arose from conflicts of military theories in the p 1919-1939. Several violently conflicting theories held the stage ^ the twenty years of armistice, and paralyzed the minds of military m ^ the point where thev were unable to provide consistent advice on politicians could base their decisions.

This ie\\v of the tactical function of tanks continued to be held in high mili- ar V circles in France and England until too late in 1940. It was sharplv c wllenged, even a decade earlier, by those who insisted that tanks should e organized in distinct units (armored brigades or divisions) and should used, without close infantry support, moving as perpendicular col- mns rather than in parallel lines against the defensive formations, and °uld seek to penetrate through these formations at high speed and Knout consolidating the ground covered, in order to fan out on the • ar of the defensive formations to disrupt their supplies, communica- 0ns > and reserves. According to these new ideas, the breakthrough made / such an armored column could be exploited and the ground consoli- e \" by motorized infantry, following the armored division in trucks dismounting to occupy areas where this would be most useful. m France, the new theory of armored warfare was advocated most porously by Colonel Charles de Gaulle. It was generally rejected by ' s su perior officers, so that De Gaulle was still a colonel in 1940. This eory was, however, accepted in the German Army, notably by Heinz derian in 1934, and was used very effectively against the Poles in 939 and against the Western Front in 1940. At full strength a German panzer (armored) division had two regi- es of tanks and two regiments of motorized infantry plus various P cialized companies. This gave it a total of 14,000 men with 250 tanks about 3,000 motorized vehicles. In September 1939, Germany had °f these panzer divisions with a total of 1,650 tanks of which one- third were 18-ton models with a 37-mm. gun (Mark III), while two- s were 10-ton models (Mark II). By May 1940, when the attack s made in the west, there were 10 armored divisions with a total of ' Oo tanks, some of which were the new Mark IV model, a 23-ton v eyance carrying a 75-mm. gun. No major increase occurred in the , y ear » but the number of armored divisions was doubled by splitting tetl which existed in May 1940. Thus in June 1941, when Germany c ked Russia, it had 20 armored divisions with a total of 3,000 tanks, *nich several hundred were Mark IV but 1,000 were still Mark II. In I Position to these, Poland had only a handful of tanks in 1939, France over 3,000 in May 1940, and the Soviet Union had, in June 1941, ut '5>ooo scattered tanks, almost all light or obsolescent models. second theory which paralyzed the Western Powers in the years re World War II was concerned with the superiority of defensive g offensive tactics.

It was argued, on the basis of the experience of World War I, that machine guns could hold up advancing infantry indefinitely and that artillery fire, carefully placed and ranged so that it could cover the field, coul prevent tanks from silencing the defensive machine guns to allow i n \" fantry to advance. The Maginot Line was based on these theories. As such, it was no a defense in depth (which would seek to break up offensive columns &> allowing them to penetrate to varying depths, thus separating tanks, infantry, and artillery so that each could be dealt with by proper weapon as impetus was dispersed), but was a rigid line (which sought to stop the offensive lines in front of it, as a whole). The theory of defensive superiority left the military forces of \" Western states with inadequate offensive training, poor offensive mora 1 and unable to come to the help of distant allies (like Poland); it P ut premium on a passive, indecisive, inactive military outlook (such shown by Petain or Gamelin in the years leading up to 1940) and ie them unable to handle any real offensive when it came against them. * theory of continuous defensive lines, which must be kept intact or stantly reestablished whenever they are breached, created a psycholog which was incapable of dealing with an assault which came at it m C umns and inevitably must breach any defensive line at the point or 1 pact.

No one paid •nuch attention to the fact that, in both of these cases, the targets were totally undefended. 1 he military advocates of such air bombardment, most of them con- siderably more moderate than General Douhet, concentrated their at- tention on what was called \"strategic bombing,\" that is, on the construc- t] on of bn g-range bombing planes for use against industrial targets and her civilian objectives and on very fast fighter planes for defense a gainst such bombers. They generally belittled the effectiveness of anti- lr craft artillery and were generally warm advocates of an air force sep- rately organized and commanded and thus not under the direct control army or naval commanders. These advocates were very influential in Br 'tain and in the United States. * he upholders of strategic bombing received little encouragement in e rniany, in Russia, or even in France, because of the dominant posi- ' on held by traditional army officers in all three of these countries. In ra nce, all kinds of air power were generally neglected, while in the fer two countries strategic bombing against civilian objectives was c °nipletely subordinated in favor of tactical bombing of military objec- ts immediately on the fighting front. Such tactical bombing demanded Panes of a more flexible character, with shorter range than strategic °nibers and less speed than defensive fighters, and under the closest ?. nt i\"ol by the local commanders of ground forces so that their bombing °rts could be directed, like a kind of mobile and long-range artillery, n ose points of resistance, of supply, or of reserves which would help e ground offensive most effectively. Such \"dive-bombers,\" or Stukas, r a ved a major role in the early German victories of 1939-1941. Here, 5 air >, this superiority was based on quality and method of usage and on numbers.

So long as he remained in office, Chamber a was convinced that no military decision could be reached and that iJ e many could be beaten only by economic measures. Even after the of France, the British chiefs of staff declared, \"Upon the economic W ^ tor depends our only hope of bringing about the downfall of Germany- Early in October, Hitler made a tentative offer to negotiate peace Wj the Western Powers, on the grounds that the cause of the fighting land, no longer existed. This offer was rejected by the Western P°\"' \\ with the public declaration that they were determined to destroy Hit regime. This meant that the war must continue. The British answer Hitler's offer, and possibly the French answer as well, was not base much on a desire to continue with the war as it was on the belief Hitler's rule in Germany was insecure and that the best way to r ^ peace would be to encourage some anti-Hitler movement within many itself.

He hoped that a long eco- nomic blockade would give rise to such discontent inside Germany that Hitler would be removed and peace made. GERMAN MOBILIZATION AND THE ALLIED ECONOMICAL BLOCKADE Germany was extremely vulnerable to a blockade, but its effects were •ndecisive. In spite of some casual threats by Hitler that Germany was prepared for a war of any duration, no plans had been made for a long Wa r, and there was no real effort toward economic mobilization by Ger- irian y before 1943. The country's industrial plant for making armaments Was increased only slightly in the five years 1937-1942, so that, contrary 0 general opinion, Germany was neither armed to the teeth nor fully Mobilized in this period. m each of the four years 1939-1942, Britain's production of tanks, self- P r °pelled guns, and planes was higher than Germany's. In the first four months of the war (September-December 1939), for example, England Produced 314 tanks, while Germany produced 247. The Germans ex- pected each military campaign to be of such brief duration that no real conomic mobilization would be necessary. This policy was successful nt \" Hitler bogged down in Russia in 1941, but, even there, the Fiihrer's c °nviction that Russia would coll apse after just one more attack delayed ec °nomic mobilization for months. As late as September 1941, Hitler issued an order for a substantial Auction in armaments production, and the counterorder calling for full m °bilization of the German economic system was not issued until the *7 day of that year. Even then the mobilization was never total or any- Un g like it. The captured records of the German War Ministry for the . ar 1944, the year of the big effort, show that only about 33 percent Germany's output in that year went for direct war purposes com- pared to 40 percent in the United States, and almost 45 percent in Brit- • I he results of this effort in airplane production can be seen in the ct that Germany produced almost 40,000 aircraft of all kinds in that ) ar 19^^ w hil c England produced almost 30,000 and the United States P oduced over 96,000 military aircraft in the same year: Germany's economic mobilization which began in 1942 was to have en carried out by Fritz Todt, the engineer who had been in charge of e construction of the Westwall. Todt, however, was killed in an air- P a ne crash on February 12. 1942. His successor, Albert Speer, was an ganizer of great ability, but he had to share his functions with several er offices, including Goring's Four-Year-Plan organization, and he .Pent most of his time negotiating agreements to obtain needed resources °m these. A Central Planning Board, on which Speer was one of four"},{"pageNumber":685,"pageContent":"6-JO  TRAGEDY AND HOPE men, had powers of top allocation of material resources, but no coiitro over labor. On September 2, 1943, Speer's office was amalgamated wit the raw-materials department of the Ministry of Economics to form a Ministry of Armaments and War Production. This new organization 0 - tained control of more and more of the production program witho u ever obtaining important parts of it. It took eighteen months to get c0 trol of naval construction, including submarines and guns (July '943 December 1944), while Speer took over production of fighter pl ;ine only in March 1944, and of all other planes except \"jets\" in June 1044- At the same time, more and more war production was getting into hands of the S.S. because its control of concentration camps gave it largest available supply of labor. As a result, Speer's office never »a anything like complete control of economic mobilization. It is amaz\" g that Germany could have carried on such a great war effort with su a ramshackle organization of its economic life.  , , When Germany began the war in September 1939, less than a tW of its oil, rubber, and iron ore were of domestic origin; it had only tw months' supply of gasoline at the peacetime rate of consumption 9 about three months' suppiv of aviation fuel. Germany expended less tn< 100,000 tons of gasoline and oil in Poland and less than 500,000 tons the conquest of Denmark, Norwav, the Low Countries, and France the period April-June 1940, but captured in the process about two fl> lion tons, mostlv in France. At first the British economic warfare against German)' was quanti tive rather than qualitative, seeking to reduce the supply of all war teriel rather than concentrating attention, as was done later, on in rupting the supply of a few vital commodities such as ball bearings aviation fuel. The blockade, with little real effort, was able to cut immediately over half of Germany's supply of petroleum products almost half of its iron ore, but, in general, the blockade was estabns slowly. There was verv poor Anglo-French coordination for the 1* period before the fall of France in June 1940, and there was a g cn agreement not to use aerial bombardment, preemptive buying, eX P control of enemy products, or rationing of neutral purchases. 1 special techniques of economic warfare began to be applied only ' n spring of 1940, just before they were disrupted by the fall of Franc • The earlv British efforts to control contraband and to obtain a q 11 tative restriction on German imports placed a burden on the navy « it was unable to bear, particularly because of the demand for nava sels for convoy duty.

(about 80 \"'lies west of Ireland), so that the British Navy did not have to convoy farther west than this line. As far as the U-boats were concerned, there was no improvement in . Nation until the latter half of 1941. The number of U-boat sink- ln gs reached seven a month, and Germany's replacement capacity for ding these weapons reached 15 a month (compared to 25 a month in le rirst World War). This production margin made it possible to raise e number of German submarines at sea, by steadv steps, from 15 in P r « 1941 to 60 at the end of the year. This improvement, from the errnan point of view, was counterbalanced by an improvement in the t'tish antisubmarine defense tactics, as we shall see, but the struggle eeame so severe that it is deservedly known as the Battle of the Atlantic. Ur present concern with this subject lies in the fact that the inade- 4 a cy of the German submarine attack in 1939-1941 made it considerably asier for the British Navy to cope with the blockade problem. n contraband control work, suspicious merchant vessels were forced put into a control harbor for search of their cargoes. Control points er e placed in Canada, in the Mediterranean, in the north of Scotland, d elsewhere, but the United States would not permit one in the Carib- ea n Sea area. When vessels being detained began to clog up these ports, °'e categories of vessels Mere exempt from control. This applied, for arnple, to American ships after January 1940. In order to reduce con- gestion and delay, vessels which certified that they had no contraband gave detailed reports of their lading were issued commercial pass- im tts, called navicerts, bv British representatives in their ports of de- r tture and were generally exempt from search or delay. This use of v icerts, voluntary at first, was made compulsory in July 1940. At the ue time, the use of British credit, repair facilities, insurance, refueling a ions, charts, and all kinds of shipping aids were denied to vessels lc n did not have a British \"ship-warrant.\" This system, with the un- Cl al support of the United States, gradually made it possible to control °st of the shipping of the world. The United States and other coun- ts also cooperated from 1940 in rerouting passengers and mails through P mts like Bermuda or Gibraltar where they could be searched by the 'tish. This gave Britain control of information and enemy funds for \"'ockade purposes. n order to reduce the enemy's ability to buy abroad, financial con- ec tions were cut, his funds abroad were frozen, and his exports were"},{"pageNumber":687,"pageContent":"6 7 2  TRAGEDY AND HOPE blocked. The United States cooperated in these efforts as well, freezing the financial assets of various nations as thev were conquered by the ag- gressor Powers and finally the assets of the aggressors themselves in June- July i 94 ,. One of the chief steps in this effort was the interruption of the export of German coal by sea from the Baltic to Italy on March 5, 1940, three months before Italy itself became a belligerent. This dis- rupted the Italian economy. Efforts to supply only half of Italy's needs from Germany by rail almost disrupted the German transportation sys- tem (since it required the use of 15,000 railroad cars). At the same time, curtailment of Italian exports and the need to buy British coal reduced the Italian gold reserve, almost at once, from 2.3 to 1.3 billion lire. Because the British Navy lacked ships to enforce any complete con- trol of contraband by stopping vessels for search, various devices were adopted. Beginning in December 1939, agreements were signed with neu- trals by which these latter agreed not to reexport their imports to Brit- ain s enemies. Compulsory rationing of neutral imports was established at the end of July 1940. At the same time, preemptive buying of vital commodities at their source to prevent Germany and its allies from ob- taining them began. Because of limited British funds, most of this task of preemptive buying was taken over by the United States, almost com- pletely so by February 1941. After 1941, the blockade became increasingly effective especially by the elimination of neutrals (like the Soviet Union, Japan, and the United States) and by the shift from quantitative to qualitative controls. Under this new system the blockade concentrated on a few vital materials and commodities, trying to increase the rate of German usage of these or to reduce their stocks by bombardment or sabotage, and seeking out such materials (like industrial diamonds) at their sources frequently in re- mote regions of the earth, then following them by economic-intelligence information to a point where Britain could get them by seizure or by preemptive purchase. The blockade was enforced by Britain with little regard for interna- tional law or for neutral rights, but there was relatively little protest from the neutrals, because the most influential neutrals were already so deeply committed to one side or to the other that they could hardly be regarded as neutrals and were not prepared to defend'such a status The United States openly favored Britain, while Italy and Japan equally openly fa- vored Germany. The Soviet Union favored neither side but was very fearful of attack from both; until April i 94 o, it was more fearful of Britain and France, while after the fall of Norway and France it became increasingly fearful of Germany. Both of these fears, through geographic and political circumstances, inclined it to a wholehearted economic sup- port of Germany. This continued to the day of the German attack on the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941."},{"pageNumber":688,"pageContent":"WORLD WAR II: TIDE OF AGGRESSION, I939-I94.I 673 The Nazi-Soviet Trade Agreement of August 19, 1939, promised that Germany would provide 200 million marks' credit to be used for ma- chinery and industrial installations for Russia in return for Russian raw materials to the value of 180 million marks. On February it, 1940, a new agreement increased these exchanges to 750 million marks' value and Provided that Russian deli\\ 'eries should be made in 18 months and be paid for bv German deliveries covering 27 months, the accounts to be hi.' oalanced in this 2:3 ratio at six-month intervals. At the same time, Rus- S1 a promised to facilitate transshipment of goods to Germany from Iran, Afghanistan, and the Far East, across Siberia. This Trans-Siberian leak in the blockade of Germany could have been 01 great significance because it allowed Germany to keep contact with allied Japan and provided a route to the tin, rubber, and oil of the Netherlands Indies and southeast Asia. However, transportation diffi- culties, lack of full cooperation by the Russians and Japanese, as well as Payment problems, kept the 1940 total for Trans-Siberian freightage to Germany down to about 166,000 tons, of which 58,000 were soybeans an d 45,000 were whale oil. In the five months of 1941, before the out- break of war in Russia, this transit of goods to Germanv reached 212,000 oris with soybeans and whale oil accounting for 142,000 tons of the total, ouch essential items as rubber, tin, copper, wool, or lubricating oils amounted to only a small fraction of the total. Germany did much better in obtaining goods from the Soviet Union 1 s df, for the total on this score reached 4,541,202 tons over the 22 months from September 1, 1939 to June 22, 1941. The largest items in his fig ure were 1,594,530 tons of grain, 777,691 tons of wood and tim- er, 641,604 tons of petroleum products, 165.157 tons of manganese ore, nd '39,460 tons of cotton, but, once again, there were relatively small arn ounts or \" Vlt '^ defense materials which Germany urgently needed. On . other hand, the items Germanv did obtain were very profitable to it K      * . oecause Germany was far behind on its repayments to Russia, a situa- lQ ri which became worse as June 1941 approached. The materials Ger- many had promised in payment were industrial products of great value 0 the Soviet defense, and Germany delayed in its shipments as much as Possible because of Hitler's plans to attack eastward. The Soviet demands at the Germans should catch up on their arrears of payment became ne of the irritants which hastened the Nazi attack on Russia in 1941. , On the whole, the blockade had no decisive effect on Germany's abil- } to wage war until 1945. After examining the evidence on this prob- e m, the chiefs of the blockade of the Foreign Economic Administration \" ashington wrote, \"Germany's war production and military opera- °ns were never seriously hampered by a shortage of any essential raw laterials or industrial products, with the single exception of petroleum— a even that shortage resulted from the combined effect of the Soviet"},{"pageNumber":689,"pageContent":"674  TRAGEDY AND HOPE Army's capture of Romanian oil fields and the concentrated bombing of Germany's synthetic production rather than directly from economic warfare.\" The same writers point out that Germany's food supply, in calories per capita, was at the prewar level until the very last months of the war. The ability of the Germans to cope with the blockade was largely due to their high level of engineering skill and their ruthless exploitation of conquered Europe, especially of the manpower of dominated areas- German engineering ability made it possible to get around material short- ages or to repair industrial plants damaged by air raids, but these efforts required more and more manpower, which Germany lacked. An increase in the labor supply was obtained by enslaving the captured peoples 01 Poland, Czechoslovakia, Russia, and other countries. In the same way, the German food supply was kept up by starving these enslaved peoples- In the early part of the war, the blockade was not effective because of the low level of German mobilization, the slow and faulty fashion m which the blockade was (perhaps necessarily) applied, the large number of neutral and nonbelligerent countries, the leaks to Germany across Soviet Russia and Vichv France, the ineffectiveness of quantitative con- trols under a limited naval patrol, and the succession of German con- quests which brought such valuable assets as the Norwegian iron-ore route, the French iron mines and aluminum industry, the Romanian 01 wells, or the Yugoslav copper mines under direct German control.

At the fifth meeting, V enlo on November 9th, the negotiators, Mho were reallv members or the Security Police of the S.S., shot Lieutenant Klop, and escaped into erniany with his body, the two British agents, a Dutch chauffeur, and 1e automobile in which they had been traveling. The incident aroused gieat notoriety at the time and, in some circles, was taken to indicate ™t Britain was really eager to find some way out of the conflict, in P'tc of its proclaimed determination to fight to a finish. file Venlo incident was but one, and on the whole a rather unim- portant one, of a number of unsuccessful efforts to make peace between le Western Powers and Germany in the six months following the de- u eat °f Poland. These efforts combined with the lack of fighting in the phony war\" to convince the leaders of the Soviet Union that the West- rn Powers had little heart in fighting Germany and would prefer to be gnting Russia. As we shall see, this was probably true of Chamberlain . \"' s close associates and of Daladier and his successor as prime min- er of France, Paul Revnaud. To avoid or at least postpone an attack, torn either the Western Powers or Germany, became the chief aim of oviet policy, and every effort was made to strengthen Russia's military, strategic, and political position. It was felt in the Kremlin, in the period rorn September to May, that the danger of attack was greater from the estern Powers than it was from Germany, since Germany was in such fa e at need of Russian raw materials that it would probably keep the Peace if the Soviet Union made serious efforts to fulfill the economic gfeenients it had signed with Germany. Moreover, the political agree- nts °f August 23 rd and September 28th, by giving the Soviet Union re e hand east of a specified line, made it possible for Russia to engthen its defenses against Germany by advancing its frontiers and 1 itary bases up to that line. Furthermore, the Soviet leaders believed at full economic cooperation with Germany might persuade Hitler to pressure on Japan to reduce its pressure on the Soviet Far Eastern frontier. he Japanese pressure on the Soviet Far East reached its peak in the • ar s 1938 and 1939 with two attacks by the Japanese Army on Soviet itory. The second of these attacks, at Nomonhan on the Manchurian- n golian frontier, resulted in a major Japanese defeat in which Nippon ered 52,000 casualties; it was ended by a truce signed on September ' lQ 39> only one day before Russian forces began to move into Po-"},{"pageNumber":691,"pageContent":"676  TRAGEDY AND HOPE land. From the diplomatic point of view the Soviet Far Eastern policy was a success, for Hitler, in the years 1939-1941, put pressure on Jap» n to relax its efforts to expand on the northern part of the Asiastic main- land and to replace this with a movement against British Malaya an the Netherlands East Indies. The Japanese defeat at Nomonhan and the fact that the raw materials which Japan needed were to be found in tn south rather than in Mongolia, Siberia, or even northern China, p er \" suadcd Japan to accept the change of direction. A Soviet ambassado returned to Tokyo in November 1939, for the first time since June .938. During the period 1929 to October 1941, the Soviet Union had ex- cellent information about Japanese affairs from its \"master spy\" i n tn Far East, Richard Sorge. Sorge, a member of the Nazi Party from i°33' representative of many German newspapers in Tokyo from the sam year, and press attache in the German Embassy in Tokyo in 1939— 1 94 1 ' had an excellent knowledge of the most secret matters in the Far £ a because of his own intimate relations with the German ambassador an because of his secret agents (including Saionji, adopted son of the W Genro,\" and Ozaki, adviser to Prince Konoye) in Japanese governing circles. By reporting to Moscow on the condition of the Japanese mi - tary forces and the gradual triumph, within the Japanese government, o the anti-British over the anti-Russian influence, Sorge made it p ossl for the Soviet Union to weaken its defenses in the Far East in order strengthen them in Europe. In Europe, after the occupation of Poland (which shielded the Ku sian center), the Soviet leaders were worried about two areas. In south, including the Balkans, the Dardanelles, or the Caspian oil he they were very fearful of an Anglo-French attack, while in the Ba they were fearful of both the Western Powers and Germany. The Soviet fears of the Western Powers in the south appear q ul unfounded to us, but seemed very real to them in 1939. The inform 30 which has been released since 1945 shows that there was some basis this fear but that the Anglo-French threat to Russia was much gr ea in the Baltic than it was in the south. In the latter area the Kremlin V suspicious of the French Army of the Orient in Syria. The Russians lieved that General Maxime Weygand had a force of several hundr thousand men which he wished to use across Iran or Turkey in an tack on the Russian oil fields in the Caspian region. In January >94 ' Germany obtained reports from Paris that Weygand proposed to a the Soviet Union from Romania. As a matter of fact, Weygand had o three poorly equipped divisions totaling about 40,000 men, and his p were largely defensive.

Turkey, Greece, Romania, and Yugo- slavia were joined in a Balkan Entente aimed at preventing any Bulgarian Agression. Since these four states could mobilize over a hundred divi- sions, although lacking all modern or heavy equipment, thev could keep Bulgaria quiet. Unfortunately, the Balkan Entente was not designed for protection against Italy or Germany, where the real danger lay. Italy had various projects to attack Greece from the Albanian terri- tory it had seized in April 1939. It also had fully matured plans to dis- rupt Yugoslavia by subsidizing and supporting a Croat revolt, under Ante Pavelic, against the dominant Serb majority in that state. During tne \"phony war\" the Italians hoped that the Western Powers would a 'low Italy to carry out its project against Yugoslavia in order to block an .V German movement into that area. Such permission seemed possible trom the fact that the democratic states had not guaranteed Yugoslavia a s they h a d t he other three states of the Balkan Entente. Italy's project Wa s set for early June 1940, but was interrupted by Hitler's attack in the West, which was made, without notifying his Italian partner, on May 10th. Another element of instability in southeastern Europe was the posi- >on of Hungary, which aspired to detach Transylvania from Romania. m ce Hungary could not take this area by its own power, it sought support from Italy rather than from Germany (which the Hungarians Iea red). With Italian support, Hungary refused to allow German troops 0 cross its territory to attack Poland in September 1939, and began to e gotiate an agreement with Italy by which the Duke of Aosta would offered the crown of Hungary, as an anti-German solution to Hun- gary s ambiguous constitutional position.

This was signed with France and England on October 19, 1939 in the form of a mutual- assistance pact, except that Turkey could not be compelled to take up arms against Russia. This last clause was inserted on Turkish insistence but was kept secret and, in consequence, the Soviet Union was not re- assured by the agreement. In the meantime the Soviet Union took steps to defend itself against any attack from the Baltic. In the period September 29-Octobcr 10, 193°- three of the Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, were forced to sign military-assistance pacts with Russia. Estonia and Latvia provided naval and air bases for Russian forces, while the citv of Vilna was given to Lithuania by Russia. About 25,000 Russian troops were stationed in each of the three countries. Appeals from these countries to Germany for support against Russia were summarily rejected, and they were ad- vised to yield to the Soviet demands. As' part of the reorganization of this area, Hitler on September 27th ordered that the so-called \"Baits\" (German-speaking residents of the Baltic states) should be moved W Germany as quickly as possible. This was done within a month. From the Soviet point of view Finland provided a much more im- portant problem than any of the Baltic states. The city of Leningrad, one of Russia's greatest industrial centers with a population of 3,191.°°° persons, was joined to the Baltic Sea by the Gulf of Finland. This gulf- about 150 miles long and 50 miles wide', ran west to east, with its north- ern and eastern shores occupied by Finland and its southern shore largely Estonian. Leningrad, at the extreme southeastern corner of the gulf, waS at the southern end of the Karelian Isthmus, a neck of land running north and south between the gulf and Lake Ladoga, some 20 miles farther east. The Finnish frontier crossed this isthmus from the gulf to Lake Ladoga only 20 miles north of Leningrad. On October 14th the Soviet Union demanded that the Finnish fron- tier north of Leningrad be pushed back along the shore of the gulf s ° that the frontier would run westward from Lake Ladoga instead of southward as formerly. This would put the Finnish frontier about 5° miles from Leningrad, leaving Finland about half of the Karelian Isthmus- In addition, the Bolsheviks demanded a 30-vear lease on the Finnish naval base at Hangd at the entrance to the Gulf of Finland, a strip about i°° miles long and 10 miles wide in central Finland (where the Finnish fron- tier came closest to the railroad line between Leningrad and Russia's ice-free port of Murmansk on the Arctic Sea), and a small area of about 25 square miles where the Finnish frontier reached the Arctic Ocean west of Murmansk. In return for these concessions Moscow of- fered a nonaggression pact, about 2,100 square miles of wooded area in central Finland, and permission to Finland to fortify the Aaland Islands between Finland and Sweden, something which had been forbidden since 1921."},{"pageNumber":694,"pageContent":"WORLD WAR II: TIDE OF AGGRESSION, I939-1 941 679 h is not yet clear why Finland rejected the Russian demands of Octo- er '939. The Germans and Russians believed that it was done under ntish influence, but the evidence is not available. At any rate, the Finns asked for German support and were rebuffed as early as October 6-7, '939 (before the Russian demands were received); they ordered mobili- ation of their armed forces against the Soviet Union on October 9th, and were reported by the German minister to be \"completely mobi- ized ten days later.

That Russia was an unprovoked aggressor is beyond question, but there was at least a surface inconsistency between the violence of t ne Anglo-French reaction against Russian aggression in 1939 and the com- placency with which they had viewed other aggressions in 1931—'939- This last act of the League of Nations was its most efficient. Although the League's consideration of the Japanese aggression in China had re- quired fifteen months and resulted in no punishment, Russia was con- demned in eleven days in December 1939. The German aggressions 0 1936-1939 had not even been submitted to the League of Nations, and tne Italian seizure of Albania had been recognized by Britain with unseemly haste earlier in 1939, but the Anglo-French leaders now prepared to attac the Soviet Union both from Finland and from Syria. In the north, every effort was made by France and Britain to turn tn Soviet attack on Finland into a general war against Russia. On DecernM 19, 1939, the Supreme War Council decided to provide Finland with a indirect assistance in their power\" and to use diplomatic pressure on i^ 0 \" way and Sweden to aid Finland against Russia. The Scandinavian coun- tries were informed of this on December 27th. On February 5, I0 4 0 ' the Supreme War Council decided to send to Finland an expeditionary force of 100,000 heavilv armed troops to fight the Soviet hordes. *J e \" many at once warned Norwav and Sweden that it would take actio against them if the two Scandinavian countries permitted passage of tM force. Germany and Russia were both eager to end the Finnisii fighting before any Anglo-French intervention could begin, the former becaus it feared that Anglo-French forces in Scandinavia would be able to stop shipments of Swedish iron ore across Norway to Germany through t seaport of Narvik, the Russians because they were convinced of an Ang 1 French desire to attack them. The evidence supports both of the fears. Because of its very high quality, Swedish iron ore was essential to t perman steel industry. In 1938 Germany imported almost 22 million to of ore, of which almost nine million tons came from Sweden and over fi million came from France. A German-Swedish trade agreement of v cember 22, 1939, promised that Sweden would ship ten million tons ore in 1940, of which two or three million would go bv way of Narvi As early as September 1939, the British were discussing a project interrupt the Narvik shipments either by an invasion of Norway ° r '• mining Norwegian territorial waters.

Accordingly, Germany began to prepare its own plans to seize Norway first. As a matter of fact, the Anglo-French expeditionary force was really !? ten ded to attack Russia, but it was unable to arrive on time, although ntain and France did all they could to force Finland to continue to fight ntil they could arrive on the scene. In February word was sent that if inland made peace the two Western Powers would not be bound to support Finnish independence after the great war ended. On January 3rd the British ambassador was withdrawn from Moscow. On February 2 °tn Lord Halifax rejected a Soviet request that Britain convey its peace erms to Finland; they had to be sent through Sweden instead. On March 4\" Daladier and Lord Ironsides formally promised Finland an ex- peditionary force of 57,000 men. The Scandinavian countries put pres- Ttfe on Finland not to ask for troops, and informed Britain that they °uld tear up their railroad tracks if the expeditionary force tried to cross. When the request from the Finns did not arrive, Daladier, on March ' sent them a threatening message which said: \"I assure you once 0re ' We are ready to give our help immediately. The airplanes are ready ake off. The operational force is ready. If Finland does not now make er appeal to the Western Powers, it is obvious that at the end of the at the Western Powers cannot assume the slightest responsibility for ne final settlement regarding Finnish territory.\" According to the Finnish foreign minister, V. Tanner, Daladier at this e told the Finnish military attache in Paris that if Finland stopped ° ing Russia, the Western Powers would make peace with Germany. cc ording to the same authority, Anglo-French agents did all they could, P to the final moment, to prevent or to disrupt the Soviet-Finnish peace B°tiations, and had made plans to cross Scandinavia, even without r mission, and to use any Finnish appeal for an expeditionary force as a a pon to arouse the Scandinavian people to overthrow their own gov- rnents. The Swedish prime minister, in return, threatened to fight on e side of Russia against any Entente effort to force a transit. When the \" m sh request did not come, Britain, on March 12th, informed Norway VVe den that it had arrived, and made a formal request for transit ss tne two countries.

To resist this steady pressure, Finland began, in August 1940, secret military con- versations with Germany. The failure of the Anglo-French expeditionary force to reach Finland does not mean that no aid reached the Finns. Germany refused all aid, and intercepted most of Italy's aid, releasing it again once peace had been made. The Western Powers, however, encouraged volunteers to go and sent much valuable equipment. Earlv in March, Chamberlain wrote to his sister about Finnish aid as follows: \"Thev began by asking for fighter planes, and we sent all the surplus we could lay hands on. They aske for AA guns, and again we stripped our own imperfectly-armed home defences to help them. Thev asked for small arms ammunition, and we gave them priority over our own army.

Thev said that men were no good now, but that they woul want 30,000 in the spring.\" The Soviet-Finnish treatv of March 12th did not put an end to trie Anglo-French projects to attack Russia or to cross Scandinavia. Anger against both the Soviet Union and the Scandinavian countries remaine high in Paris and London. The Finnish expeditionary force was kep together in England, where its existence gave a powerful incentive to 11 German project to invade Norway before Britain did so. On April 5 > only four days before the German attack on Norway, Lord Halifax sent note to Norway and Sweden threatenting these countries with dire, unstated, consequences at the hands of Britain if they refused to coopera with the Western Powers in sending aid to Finland \"in whatever mann they mav see fit\" in anv future Soviet attack on Finland.  ,  Six days later, two days after Germany's aggression against Dennia and Norway, General Wevgand was ordered to attack the Soviet Un from Svria.

These p • were submitted on February 22nd but were held up in favor of the nish project; on April nth, a month after the Soviet-Finnish peace, new French premier, Revnaud, ordered General Weygand to carry the raid on the Soviet oil wells of the Caucasus as soon as possible.

Each of these order was reported to the West through the Dutch military attache in Berlin, but, as no attack eventuated, it is probable that faith in this in- formant declined. information also came from other sources. One order to attack was re ported to the West by Count Ciano, the Italian foreign minister, but he Italians were dependent on their own spies, since thev could get no ^formation from Hitler, and did not know of the date which was finally Us ed on May 10th. In January a German plane with operational orders for he attack made an emergency' landing in Belgium; the orders were cap- Ur ed before they could be destroyed completely. This caused great arm in the West, but no one could be sure if the captured docu- ments were authentic or part of a Nazi false alarm. 1° the meantime, from December 1939, onward, plans to invade Nor- a y were prepared at the insistence of the German admirals.

The French plan of campaign was dominated by two factors: the Maginot Line and Plan D. The Maginot Line, an elaborate and expensive system of permanent fortifications, ran from Switzerland to Montmedy. behind this line, where they could not be used in the great battle draw- ln g near, were stationed 62 of 102 French divisions on this frontier. From '\"ontmedy to the sea, France had 40 divisions, plus the British Expedi- tionary Force of 10 divisions. According to Plan D, the anticipated German attack on the Low Countries was to be met by the Allied forces n orth of Montmedy advancing as rapidly as possible to meet the enemy, the Belgian Army of 20 divisions were successful in holding up the German advance, it was hoped that a new Belgian-British-French line could be formed along the Dyle River or even forty miles farther north along the Albert Canal; if the Belgian defense were less successful, the new lne vy as to be formed along the Scheldt River, fifty miles behind the Dyle. 1 0 carry out this rapid movement as soon as the German attack was an- nounced, the French placed their best and fastest divisions on the extreme e *t (in Henri Giraud's Seventh Army) and their poorest divisions close 0 the end of the Maginot Line (in Andre Corap's Ninth Army), where hey were expected to make a relatively short advance to take a position e t\\veen Sedan and Namur along the Meuse River. Once this Plan D avance into the Low Countries had been achieved, it was expected that e new line, from the sea to Longwy (deep in the Maginot Line), would sta nd as follows: Netherlands forces—10 divisions fraud's Seventh Army—7 divisions Belgian forces-20 divisions Lord Gort's British Expeditionary Force—10 divisions Jean Blanchard's First Army—6 divisions Corap's Ninth Army-9 divisions Charles Huntziger's Second Army—7 divisions f'ginally the German plans were, as the French anticipated, a modi- version of the Schliefen Plan of 1905, involving a wide sweep through Low Countries. The false alarms of a German attack in the winter of 939-1940 revealed to the Germans, however, that the Allies would meet attack by a rapid advance into Belgium. Accordingly, at the sugges- ot General Erich von Manstein, the Germans modified their plans to ourage the Allied advance into Belgium while the Germans planned"},{"pageNumber":701,"pageContent":"686  TRAGEDY AND HOPE to strike with their greatest strength at Sedan, the pivot of the Allied turning movement. Such an assault at Sedan made it necessary for the German forces to pass over the narrow, winding roads of the Ardennes Forest, then to cross the deep and swift Meuse River, and to break between Corap's and Huntziger's forces, but, if this could be done and Sedan taken, excellent roads and a railroad ran from Sedan westward across France to the sea. Under the \"Manstein Plan\" the German attack from the North Sea to Sedan was organized in four armies. In the north, the Netherlands was attacked by the German Eighteenth Army (one panzer and four infantry divisions); in the middle, Belgium was attacked by the German Sixth Army (two panzer and 15 infantry divisions) and the German Fourth Army (two panzer and 12 infantry divisions); farther south, in the Ardennes area, France was attacked by the German Twelfth Army (fi ve panzer and four other divisions); from Sedan to Switzerland, although Germany had about 30 divisions, all were infantry formations and no major offensive was made. The \"Manstein Plan\" was a total surprise to the French. They were so convinced that the Ardennes were impassable for large forces, especially for tanks, that everything was done to make the German task easier. Corap and Huntziger placed their poorest forces (six Series B divisions, undermanned, with little training) on either side of Sedan and their bes forces on their fronts most remote from the Ardennes (that is, fr° Sedan). In Huntziger's case these better divisions were behind ti Maginot Line itself. Because of the Ardennes, Corap gave his four p 00 divisions near Sedan no antitank guns, no antiaircraft guns, and no W support (reserving these for his high-qualitv divisions forty miles farm north), and expected them to defend a front of ten miles per divisi (while the French Third Army, deep behind the Maginot Line, ha front of 1.8 miles per division). Moreover, Corap's poor divisions we not stationed on the Meuse, but two days' march to the west of it, a the were required, once the German attack began, to race the Germans to intervening river. The German attack began at 5:35 on May 10th.

The defenders on the Albert Canal were attacked from the rear °y parachutists and glider forces which had been landed behind them. 1 ne powerful fort of Eben Emael, covering the canal bridges, was cap- tured by airborne volunteers who landed on its roof and destroyed its gun apertures with explosives. Belgium's forces fell backward toward the u yle as the French and British units, according to Plan D, wheeled north- eastward, on Sedan as a pivot, to meet them. As the Belgian forces with- drew northwest, while the German attack swung southwest, the main urden of the German assault now fell on the French First Army, to pin \"own and thus prevent it from reinforcing Corap farther south. In ni s the Germans were successful; on May 15th, as news of the break- trough at Sedan became known, Gamelin ordered all forces in Belgium t0 fall backward from the Dyle Line toward the Scheldt. 1 he attack through the Ardennes on Corap's Ninth Army was made by a special German force of five panzer and three motorized divisions under eneral Paul von Kleist. These passed through the forest and crossed the euse to fling themselves on the right side of Corap's inexperienced .'visions. By the evening of May 15th, Corap's army had been \"vola- 1Ze d,' and the German spearhead was racing forward thirty-five miles est of Sedan. The misplaced French Sixth Army, in reserve 300 miles utn near Lyon, began to move toward the breach, while General •raud, with three divisions from the Seventh Army, was ordered from e extreme northwest, and seven other divisions were taken from the orces behind the Maginot Line. All these arrived too late, because von C1St s advance units crossed France and reached the sea at Abbeville on a y 20th, having covered 220 miles in eleven days. No coordinated ack was ever made on this thin extended line, although orders were ssued for it to be attacked both from the north and the south. 1 he Allied forces retreating southward from Belgium were greatly nipered by masses of refugees clogging the roads, were constantly rassed by Stukas, and had lost communication between units. There s almost no contact or cooperation between the French, British, and gians in the north, or between these and the French forces south of eist s breakthrough. Panic swept Paris.

Petain was recalled from the ambassadorship in Madrid to oe vice-premier in the new Cabinet. Certain French politicians, including Pierre Laval, hoped that Petain might play a role in French domestic politics such as Hindenburg had played in Germany: to protect the organized vested interests of industry and business from changes by the Left in a period of defeat. Weygand spent five days (May zotlwjth) in an unsuccessful effort to get a coordinated attack on Kleist's salient. On May 25th-26th, Kleist. moving up the coast from the Somme, on the rear of the northern AMied forces, captured Boulogne and Calais, leaving Dunkerque as the only major port on the Allied rear. Withdrawal to this port was threatened by a German break through the Belgian Army toward Ypres. On M aV 27th, King Leopold of Belgium made an unconditional surrender of his armies to the Germans, over the objections of the Belgian civil govern- ment and without making certain that the Allied Command had been informed. The British Expeditionary Force at once began to evacuate the Continent through Dunkerque. In seven days, using 887 water craft of all tvpes and sizes, 3 3 7-. r 3 T mt were taken off the beaches at Dunkerque under relentless air bombar - ment (May 2 8th-June 4th). By Hitler's direct order, no intensive groun attack was made on the Allied forces within the Dunkerque perimeter, a Hitler was convinced that Britain would make peace as soon as Frant was defeated, and wished to save his dwindling armored forces and mun tions for the attack on the rest of France. In the interval before this BC attack, Weygand tried to form a new line along the Somme and Ais rivers from the sea to the Maginot Line and to eliminate three briug heads the Germans already held south of the Somme. The Battle of France began on June 5th with German attacks on t western and eastern ends of the \"Wevgand Line.\" By June 8th western end had been broken, and German forces began to move the rear of the Somme defenses. As the line collapsed and the mnita 3 forces fell back, they disintegrated among packed masses of c jvl refugees, hurried onward bv German dive-bombers.

They also flatly rejected any military capitulation, for they wanted to end the fighting with an armistice which would allow France to maintain a French Army as a guarantee against any economic or social changes in France. There was also considerable pressure behind the scenes from anti- democratic French industrialists in monopolistic lines such as chemicals, light metals, synthetic fibers, and electrical utilities. These industrialists, to gcther with politicians like Laval and private or commercial banks, like t»e Banque Worms, or the Banque de l'lndochine, had been negotiating cartel and other agreements with Germany for ten years, and felt an a rmistice would offer a splendid opportunity to complete and enforce these agreements. As the military collapse continued, piteous appeals for help were sent to London and to Washington. Reynaud sent eighteen messages to _ urc hill asking for more air support, but could obtain none, as the \"Htish War Cabinet wished to save all the planes it still had for the defense of Britain after the French collapse. Appeals to Roosevelt were n ° more successful; 150 planes and 2,000 75-mm. cannons were sent, but hey sailed from Halifax only on June 17th and were at sea when the fighting ceased. A he chief concern in London and Washington was over the fate of the tench fleet and of French North and West Africa, especially Dakar. If Hitler obtained the French fleet or any considerable portion of it, British ar »d American security would be in acute jeopardy. The French fleet was of high quality and included two new battleships (Richelieu and Jean art ) which had just been built but were not yet in service. Such a ^ a yy, in combination with the German and Italian navies, might destroy Britain's sea defenses and force a British surrender. This would place America in great danger, as American security in the Atlantic had been preserved by the British fleet since 1818 and, by 1940, the whole American at tle fleet had to be kept in the Pacific to face Japan. Unly less immediate than these dangers was the threat to both British an d American security from a German occupation of French North and West Africa. This would close the British route through the Mediter- ranean immediately and allow the Italian forces in Libva to invade Egypt rth relative impunity. The possession of Dakar by German forces would provide a base from which submarines could attack the British route to \" e East by way of South Africa and might permit an attack on Brazil, 0n lv 1,700 miles west of Dakar. With these considerations in mind, Washington and London did all they could to dissuade Mussolini from attacking France and to persuade the rench to avoid any armistice which might vield either French Africa or oe French fleet to Hitler.

This was rejected by"},{"pageNumber":705,"pageContent":"690  TRAGEDY AND HOPE the French military and naval authorities. As a final effort, Churchill, ° n June 16th, offered France a political union with Britain, involving join 1 Anglo-French citizenship and a joint Cabinet. This was never considered by the French. As the military debacle continued to grow and Reynaud would no make a separate peace and could not get a Cabinet agreement to with- draw overseas, he resigned (June 16th) and was replaced by a new gov- ernment headed by Marshal Petain. The old man, surrounded by defeatists and appeasers who had been intriguing for deals with the Nazis for years, at once asked for an armistice, and issued an ambigu° us public statement which led some French units to cease fighting imme- diately. On June 10th Italy had declared war, but was unable to make any important military advances against French resistance. On June i4 c the Germans entered Paris, the French government having moved to Tours on June nth and continuing to Bordeaux on June 15th. The armistice negotiations were conducted in the same railway carriage at Compiegne in the forest of Rethondes where Germany had sur \" rendered in 1918; they took three days, and went into effect on June Hitler was so convinced that Britain would also make peace that he g» ve surprisingly lenient terms to France. In spite of Mussolini's demand , France did not have to give up any overseas territory or any ports 0 the Mediterranean, no naval vessels or any airplanes or armaments to used against England. Northern France and all the western coast to t Pyrenees came under occupation, but the rest was left unoccupied, rule by a government free from direct German control and policed by Frenc armed forces. The chief burden of the surrender came from three pro- visions: (1) the division of the country into two zones, with about two thirds of French productive capacity in the occupied zone; (2) all Fren . prisoners of war, amounting to almost two million men, were to remai in German hands until the final peace treaty, while German prisone were to be released at once; and (3) all the expenses of the German 0 cupation were to be paid by unoccupied France. The two zones we sealed off so completely that even postal communication was reduc to a minimum; this crippled the economy of the unoccupied part. 1 expenses of the army of occupation were set at the outrageous sum ° 400 million francs a day. Moreover, by fixing the exchange rate at 0 reichsmark for 20 francs, in place of the prewar rate of one for eleven francs, it becaame possible for the occupying forces to buy goods ve , cheaply in France, thus draining wealth to Germany. The governmental system of Vichy France was a kind of burea cratic tyranny. Pierre Laval pushed through a series of constitutional Ja\\ which ended the Third Republic and the parliamentary system, com ing in the hands of Marshal Petain the joint functions of head of the sta (formerly held by the president) and head of the government (forme y"},{"pageNumber":706,"pageContent":"WORLD WAR ii: TIDE OF AGGRESSION, 1939-1941 691 held by the prime minister), with the right to legislate by decree. Laval Was designated as Petain's successor in holding these powers, and the parliamentary chambers were dismissed. m spite of this appearance of centralized authority, the government as a whole operated on the basis of whim and intrigue, the various ministers following mutually inconsistent policies and seeking to extend these by ln creasing their influence over Petain. The procrastinations, suspicions, ambiguities, and secrecies of the marshal himself make it difficult to de- ernune what his own policy was, or even if he had one. It seems likely nat he followed various policies simultaneously, allowing his legal powers 0 be exercised by quite dissimilar subordinates in an effort to achieve a e\\y clearly defined aims. These aims seem to have been four in number, n decreasing importance: (1) to maintain, at all costs, the independence « unoccupied France; (2) to secure the release, as rapidly as possible, of e prisoners of war; (3) to reduce the financial charges of the occupa- 10 n forces; and (4) to reduce, bit by bit, the barriers between the occu- P J ed and unoccupied zones. I he ideology of Vichy was a typical Fascist melange of nationalism, 0c ial-solidarity, anti-Semitism, antidemocracy, anti-Communism, oppo- ion to class conflicts, to liberalism, or to secularism, with resounding asts on the virtues of discipline, self-sacrifice, authority, and repen- nc e; but all these things meant very little either to the rulers or the ule d of the new regime. In general, corruption and intrigue, idealism self-sacrifice were about as prevalent under Vichy as they had been . er tne Third Republic, but secrecy was more successful, civil liber- ies were absent, the distance between propaganda and behavior was, anything, wider, and hypocrisy replaced cynicism as the chief vice of Politicians. The two strongest characteristics of the regime, which made sufficiently solid to continue to function, were negative ones: hatred of e Third Republic and hatred of England. But these ideas were too gative and too remote from the problems of day-to-day existence to P ovide very satisfactory guides to Vichy policy. As a result, there was c °mplete confusion of policy. Some leaders, and these the less influential, like Weygand, were reso- . v an ri-German, and were patiently awaiting the day when Vichy . ** ® tur n against the German conquerors. Others, and these the more .ential, like Laval or Admiral Darlan, had faith in a final German tory over Britain, and felt that France must accept the inevitable gcrnony of Germany but try to secure for itself a privileged r sition as \"favorite satellite.\" While Petain's personal views were prob- / closer to those of Weygand, his pessimistic and defeatist personality , him to embrace the other point of view as a necessary evil.

In this situation Darlan had an advantage over Laval, in view of Petain's personal inclinations, for Laval was a wholehearted and frank advocate of collaboration with hW\" ler, while Darlan was a much more devious and ambiguous personality, and thus closer to Petain's own character and policy.

If Germany had concentrated on building submarines, t ne newly acquired U-boat bases in Norway, in the Low Countries, and f\" France might have made it possible to blockade Britain into surrender, but Hitler rejected this plan. Instead he ordered an invasion of Britain (Operation Sealion), a project in which no German, not even Hitler himself, had much confidence. At the same time, Britain's refusal to make peace revealed to the full 1 1 inadequacies of the French armistice. Hitler sought to remedy these by a project to capture Gibraltar (Operation Felix). Sealion and Felix re- quired Hitler's active attention from July to November 1940. In the nr half of December, Hitler put Sealion and Felix aside and replaced the with two new projects. The new projects sought to conquer all the r» kans (Operation Marita) and to attack the Soviet Union (Operatic Barbarossa). These went into operation in April-June 1941. Hitler's change of plans in December 1940 was a consequence or to influences: (1) it was, by that time, clear that Sealion could not be ca ried out; (2) Franco's refusal to cooperate had made Felix impractic . (3) Mussolini's foolish attempts to conquer Egypt and Greece opened a hornets' nest in the eastern Mediterranean; and (4) there w growing tension, much of it in Hitler's own mind, between Germany a the Soviet Union.

Following this, the invasion w require a large flotilla of invasion craft to carry men and supplies ac a lengthy stretch of water and to assemble these forces in combat to tion in England.

These new devices were so help that over 100 bombers were shot down by night fighters in the win of 1940-1941, and an equal number bv radar antiaircraft guns.

In 1941 new navigational techniques, using intersecting ra beams from three stations in England, were used to provide greater a curacy in navigation for more planes.

On May 29, 1940, at a Romanian r o\\vn Council, King Carol insisted that protection must be sought sewhere and that only an alignment with Germany would permit ornania to resist any possible Soviet pressure. It was felt that Germany's ee d for Romanian oil would make it very unwilling to allow the war 0 spread to that area. Accordingly, Romania abandoned its policy of eutrality and aligned itself with Germany, the foreign minister, Grigore arencu, resigning in protest at the new policy. Romania did not obtain the benefits it had hoped from its change in policy. On June 26, 1940, having previously notified Germany, the Soviet n 'on demanded Bessarabia and northern Bukovina from Romania within e \"ty-four hours. Germany protested against the demand for Bukovina, ' Ce this had not been granted to Russia in the Nazi-Soviet Agreement August 1939. Otherwise Germany made no objection, although Hitler as personally disturbed and had to be reassured by Ribbentrop that he had actually agreed to give Bessarabia to the Soviet Union. ne loss of Bessarabia was a severe blow to the more moderate leaders Romania.

Shortly thereafter German military units began to move into Romania, while Soviet units began to seize the uninhabited islands in the mouths of the Danube. At the same time a German military occupation of Finland began under the pretext that the forces in question were en route to Norway (September 19th). The confusion following the defeat of France spread quickly to the Mediterranean area. This was dominated by -two factors: (1) Mus- solini's jealous determination to obtain some glorious conquest in the Mediterranean to match Hitler's impressive victories in the north, and (2) the complete inadequacy, from Germany's point of view, of the terms of the French armistice. By these terms neither Germany nor Italy ob- tained any units of the French fleet, anv naval bases in the Mediter- ranean, or any parts of the French overseas territories. On June 24 t j 1 ' when the armistice was made, Hitler had been so convinced that Britain would make peace that he had neglected these items and had rebuffed Mussolini's efforts to include them. Within a month, Hitler recognized his error and demanded from France extensive military and naval base and transport facilities in North Africa (July 15, 1940). These demands were rejected by Petain at once. Hitler had little real interest in the Mediterranean area at any time, and simply hoped that it would remain quiet. His personal belief- a soon as the invasion of Britain became remote, was that Britain wishc to hold out until the Soviet Union became strong enough to attac Germany from the east.

In the meantime, Ribbentrop was engaged in involved diplomatic Maneuvers. The Tripartite Pact of September 1940, in spite of Russia's suspicions, was really intended to frighten the United States to abstain r °m interference in the tumults of Eurasia. To strengthen this threat, Ribbentrop sought to obtain Russia's adherence to the Tripartite Pact an d a Soviet-Japanese nonaggression pact which would free Japan in Asia to allow it to strike southward against Singapore. These maneuvers Ver e a disaster for Germany. Futile efforts to obtain Soviet adherence 0 the Tripartite Pact merely succeeded in revealing the bitter German- ooviet rivalry in Bulgaria and Finland, while the successful Soviet-Jap- anese Nonaggression Pact of April 13, 1941 made it possible to with- ra w Soviet troops from the Far East in sufficient numbers to save Moscow from Hitler's attack on that city in November. During Molotov's visit to Berlin on November 12-15, 1940, Germany ottered the Soviet Union a worldwide division of spheres of influence among the aggressor states: Italy would take North and East Africa; Ger- many would take western Europe, western and central Africa; Japan c °uld have Malaya and Indonesia; while the Soviet Union could have •tan and India; Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union would pursue a c ooperative policy in the Near East to free Turkey from its British con- actions and obtain for Russia freer access to the .Mediterranean through ne Dardanelles. Hitler offered Molotov a picture of a brilliant, if re- \"^te, future: After the conquest of England the British Empire would be appor- 'oned as a gigantic world-wide estate in bankruptcy of 40 million square k 'lometers. In this bankrupt estate there would be for Russia access to he ice-free and really open ocean. Thus far, a minority of 45 million f-uglishmen had ruled 600 million inhabitants of the British Empire.

Instead he wanted detailed answers to specific questions: Why were German troops stationed in Finland? Could not an accurate demarcation between Soviet and Nazi interests be drawn in Finland? Why could not the Nazi guarantee of Romania be balanced by a Soviet guarantee of Bulgaria, or, failing in this, the Romanian guarantee be can- celed? What were the exact limits of Germany's New Order in Europe and of Japan's East Asian Sphere? After hours of discussion, during which the Germans evaded Molo- tov's questions about Finland and Bulgaria, Ribbentrop offered Russia a protocol covering five points: (i) the Soviet Union would join the Tripartite Pact; (2) the four Powers would \"respect each other's nat- ural spheres of influence\"; (3) they would \"undertake to join no combination of Powers and to support no combination of Powers which is directed against one of the Four Powers\"; (4) the four respective spheres of influence would follow the vague German suggestions; and (5) the three European Powers would seek to detach Turkey from British influence and to open the Dardanelles to the free passage of Soviet warships. Molotov immediately presented Germany with additional proposals drawn up in a formal draft protocol. These added to the German sug- gestions five other points: (1) that German troops be withdrawn from Finland immediately, (2) that Bulgaria sign a mutual-assistance pact with the Soviet Union and hand over to it a base from which Russian naval and air forces could defend the Dardanelles, (3) that the area from Batum and Baku to the Persian Gulf be recognized as \"a center of Soviet aspirations,\" (4) that Japan yield to the Soviet Union its oil and coal concessions in northern Sakhalin, and (5) that the prospective agreement with Turkey be expanded to include a Soviet military and naval base \"on the Bosporus and Dardanelles\" and a guarantee of Tu fk ' ish independence and territorial integrity by all three Powers. Molotov's conditions for joining the Tripartite Pact enraged Hitler- Four weeks later he issued orders for Operation Barbarossa, a joi nt Finnish-German-Romanian attack on the Soviet Union. Before this could be carried out, however, the ambiguous situation on the German right flank, in the Balkans, had to be cleared up by Operation Marita- The chief aims of this operation were to drive from the area British forces which had entered Greece in consequence of the Italian attack, and to prevent them from bombing the Romanian oil fields while Ger- many was occupied with Russia.

For almost six weeks, because strong opposition in the country and in the Cabinet, Regent Prince ul resisted the German demands. When Yugoslavia accepted and S n ed the Tripartite Pact at Vienna on March 25th, it was able to tain promises of substantial concessions in return: freedom from any ae rrnan military occupation, release from any promise of military sup- r rt to Germany under the pact, and a promise of German support or Jugoslavia's desire for an outlet on the Aegean at Salonika. soviet opposition to these German advances was somewhat indirect. . e re were vigorous protests against the movement of German troops 0 Romania and Bulgaria.

In Iraq, on April 3rd, a group of army officers led by Rashid A el-Gailani overthrew the government and seized power; a month la te this new regime made an attack on British treatv installations in M eS0 potamia.

In buying supplies, chiefly from the United ates, Britain had used up, by June 1941, almost two-thirds of its 0l 'ar assets, gold stocks, and marketable United States securities. American Neutrality and Aid to Britain When the European war began in September 1939, American public pinion was united in its determination to stay out. The isolationist re- ion following American intervention in the First World War and the is Peace Conference in 1917-1919 had, if anything, become stronger t he 1930's. Historians and publicists were writing extensively to w that Germany had not been solely guilty of beginning the war in \" 4 and that the Entente Powers had made more than their share of ret treaties seeking selfish territorial aims, both before the war and dun ng the fighting. n 1934 a committee of the United States Senate investigated the e played by foreign loans and munition sales to belligerents in getting United States involved in World War I. Through the carelessness \" e Roosevelt Administration, this committee fell under the control ^olationists led by the chairman, Republican Senator Gerald P. Nye ^orth Dakota. As a result, the evidence before the committee was Hized to show that American intervention in World War I had pushed by bankers and munitions manufacturers (\"merchants of ueath\"\\ * . l ) to protect their profits and their interests in an Entente Victory *c early years of the war. Under these influences American public r ion in the late 1930's had an uncomfortable feeling that American 1 . \" a d been sent to die in 1917—1918 for selfish purposes concealed I lnd propaganda slogans about \"the rights of small nations,\" \"free- of the seas,\" or \"making the world safe for democracy.\" These ngs were reinforced in the late 1930's by growing disillusionment the cynicism of authoritarian aggression and the weakness of appeasement. All this helped to create a widespread determination K eep out of Europe's constant quarrels in the future and, above all, v °id any repetition of what was regarded as the \"error of 1917.\""},{"pageNumber":723,"pageContent":"708  TRAGEDY AND HOPE The isolationist point of view had been enacted into American statute law, not onlv in the 1920's bv restrictions on contact with tw League of Nations and other international organizations but also later, UJ the Roosevelt administrations, in the so-called Neutrality Acts. These misnamed laws sought to avoid any repetition of the events of i9'4\" 1917 bv curtailing loans and munition sales to belligerent countries. Originallv enacted in 1935, and revised in the next two years, these laws provided that export of arms and munitions to belligerents wOUJ cease whenever the President proclaimed a state to be a participant 1 a war outside the Americas. Anv materials, including munitions, name by the President had to be sold on a \"cash-and-carry\" basis, with W payment and transfer of title before leaving the United States, and ha ^ to be transported on foreign ships. The \"cash\" but not the \"earn provision also applied to all other trade with belligerents. In addition, loans to belligerents were forbidden, and American citizens could warned not to travel on belligerents' ships. An earlv statute, the Johnson Act of 1934, prevented loans to mo s European Powers bv forbidding such loans to countries whose p a >' ments were in arrears on their war debts of World War I. Moreover, b \" a so-called \"moral embargo\" the Roosevelt Administration sought restrict export of war materials on ethical or humanitarian groun where no legal basis existed for doing so. Under this provision, i° example, airplane manufacturers were asked not to sell planes to cou tries which had bombed civilians, as Italy had done in Ethiopia, japan had done in China, or the Soviet Union had done in Finland.

For this reason, the Roosevelt Administration tried to get the Congress to repeal the embargo provision of the Neutrality Acts but was unable to overcome isolationist opposition led by Senator William E. Borah of Idaho (July 1939). As soon as the war began in Europe, Roosevelt called a special ses- S1 °n of Congress to revise the neutrality laws so that the Entente Pow- ers could obtain supplies in the United States. Under the resulting revi- sion of these acts, in November 1939, the embargo on munitions was repealed and all purchases by belligerents were placed on a \"cash-and- carry\" basis; loans to belligerent Powers were forbidden, Americans Were excluded from travel on belligerent ships, and American ships w ere not to be armed, to carry munitions, or to go to any areas the \"resident had proclaimed as combat areas. Under this last provision, all European ports on the Baltic or the Atlantic from Bergen south to the Pyrenees were closed to American ships. As the war spread, these areas were extended by proclamation. The collapse of France in June 1940, combined with the arrogant Japanese demands on the Netherlands East Indies and French Indo- china (August-September 1940) and the signing of the Tripartite Pact, gave rise to a severe crisis in American foreign affairs. We have already indicated the danger to American security which could arise from the trench fleet or Dakar falling into German hands or from a successful ^azi invasion of Britain. This danger raised the controversy over Ameri- can foreign policy to a feverish pitch and widened the extremes of public opinion. These extremes ranged from the advocates of immedi- ate intervention into the war on the side of Britain on the one hand to e defenders of extreme isolationism on the other. The extreme inter- ventionists insisted that Britain could be saved only by an immediate mencan declaration of war on Germany, not because of America's ability to fight at once, which was recognized to be small, but because ntish morale needed such a declaration to provide it with the strength 0 S° on fighting. The isolationists, on the other hand, argued that it 'as no concern of the United States whether Britain collapsed or sur- ged, since Hitler had no desire to attack America, and, even if he .' tne Western Hemisphere could withdraw into itself and survive 'rth security and prosperity. Most American opinion, in the summer 1940, was undecided or confused but tended to incline to a point of le w somewhere between the two extremes. in order to unify America's political front, Roosevelt took two out- anding leaders of the Republican Party (both interventionists) into lls Cabinet as secretaries of war and of the navy.

In combination with the secretary of the treasury (Henry Morgenthau), the secretary of state (Cordell Hull), and the secretary of the interior (Harold Ickes), this gave Roosevelt a preponderantly interventionist Cabinet. Roosevelt hinisclr was sympathetic to this point of view, but his strong sense of political realism made him aware of the powerful currents of isolationism i n American public opinion, especially in the Midwest. As a consequence, Roosevelt, who seemed to the outside public to be an advanced inter- ventionist, was definitely a restraining influence inside the Administra- tion. In his own mind his role clearlv was to act as a brake on his Cabinet colleagues while he used the prestige and publicity of his office to educate American public opinion in the belief that America could not stand alone, isolated, in the world and could not allow Britain to be defeated if any acts of ours could prevent it. Outside the Administration, American public opinion was being bom- barded by paid and volunteer agitators of all shades of opinion from inside the country and from abroad. iMany of these were organize\" into lobbying and pressure groups of which the most notable were, on the interventionist side, the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies and, on the isolationst side, the America First movement- The controversy reached its peak during the presidential campaign ot 1940 and subsequently, as Congress enacted into law the vital defensive measures desired by the third Roosevelt Administration. The international crisis led Roosevelt to violate the constitutiona precedent against a third term. In spite of the fact that the Republican candidate, Wendell Willkie, was in general agreement with Roosevelt position on foreign affairs, his desire to win the election had led him to indulge in what he subsequently called \"campaign oratory\" and to make violent accusations against his opponent. Among others, he as- sured the American people that Roosevelt's reelection meant that ^ v will be at war.\" To counteract these charges and to win back aiitiwa voters who might have been attracted by the generally isolation^ outlook of the Republican Party, especially of its senior congressiona leaders, Roosevelt replied with some campaign oratory of his own- Some of his assurances were thrown back in his face later: in ^ e ^ York he said, \"We will not send our army, navy or air forces to ng in foreign lands outside of the Americas, except in case of attack\"; an in Boston he said most emphatically, \"I have said this before, but shall say it again and again and again: Your boys are not going to sent into any foreign wars.\" This \"campaign oratory\" on both sides was based on the genefl recognition that the overwhelming majority of Americans were deter- mined to stay out of war, but the confusion in the minds of this ma-"},{"pageNumber":726,"pageContent":"WORLD WAR II: TIDE OF AGGRESSION*, I93Q-IQ4I 7II jority was revealed on numerous occasions, as on October 5, 1940, when a Gallup Poll of public opinion showed that 70 percent of Americans telt it was more important to defeat Hitler than to keep out of war. I his poll was close enough to Roosevelt's own sentiments for him to feel justified in taking any actions which would increase the chances °f a Hitler defeat and improve the ability of America to defend itself. The fall of France raised the problem of American defense in an acute form. The American armv and air force were pathetically weak, while the navy was adequate to its tasks only in the Pacific. To remedy these deficiencies it was agreed, in July 1940, to seek an army of 1,400,000 Wen and an air force of 18,000 planes by April 1942, and a \"two-ocean\" navy increased by 1,325,000 tons of ships as soon as possible. These objectives could not be achieved, in view of the slowness of American mobilization, both economic and military, and were made even more unattainable by the constant demands of Britain, China, Greece, and others for military equipment as soon as it came off the production une. Two months after these goals had been set, an official memo- randum estimated that the United States had no more than 55,000 men ln its army and 189 planes in its air force ready for immediate action (September 25, 1940). As the military forces of the country slowly grew, a series of strategic plans were drawn up to fix the way in which these forces would be u sed. All these plans decided that Germany was the major danger, With Japan of secondary importance, and, accordingly, that every effort, deluding actual warfare, should be used to defeat Germany and that, until this goal was achieved, every effort must be made to postpone any showdown of strength with Japan. The priority of a German defeat over a Japanese defeat was so firmly entrenched in American strategic thinking that, as early as November, 1940, it was seriously considered that it might be necessary, if Japan attacked the United States, for the United States to make war on Germany in order to r etain this order of priority. As events turned out, Germany's declara- fl on of war on the United States four days after the Japanese attack saved the United States from the need to attempt something which American public opinion would never have condoned—an attack on Germany after we had been attacked by Japan. Although $17.7 billion had been appropriated by the American gov- ernment for rearmaments by October 1940, the actual production of armaments remained insignificant until 1942. There were several reasons r °r this slow progress. In the first place, the governmental side of the rearmament effort was not centralized because of Roosevelt's ingrained uistaste for all unified, centralized administration. Instead, similar and conflicting powers were scattered about among various administrators 0r Were granted to unwieldy committees made up of conflicting per-"},{"pageNumber":727,"pageContent":"712  TRAGEDY AND HOPE sonalities, while the reallv vital powers of duress over labor, industry. or material priorities were largely nonexistent. In the second place, industry was very reluctant, in view of the recent economic depression with its great volume of unused capital equipment, to build new plant or new equipment for defense manufacture, unless the government gave them such concessions in regard to prices, taxes, or plant depreciation that the new equipment would cost the corporation little or nothing- Even then the more monopolistic corporations (which formed the overwhelming majority of the corporations with defense contracts) were reluctant to expand production facilities, since this would jeop- ardize price and market relationships in the postwar period. Accordingly, most industrialists, especially the largest ones, who were in closest contact with the government, rejected the Administra- tion's plans for defense production as grandiose and impossible. T his was most emphatic following Roosevelt's statement in May 194° t ' iat America's goal was to produce 50,000 planes a year. Although the industry was almost unanimous in calling this a \"fantastic\" figure, is- sued only as a \"New Deal propagandist trick,\" America's plane produc- tion in the next five years was about six times this figure, and reached 96,000 in 1944. These results were achieved because the governmen paid for nine-tenths of the new factories and compelled modern mass-production methods to be adopted by what was still, even in 194 1 ' a handicraft industry. nrl In addition to the reluctance to expand capacity, both industry • anu labor were reluctant to convert existing equipment from peacetime production to war production at a time when government spending was creating a level of peacetime demand and peacetime profits sue 1 as had not been known in many years. Businessmen accepted war con- tracts but continued to allocate capacity, materials, and labor forces to civilian products because these were more profitable, satisfied 01 customers who were expected to remain customers in the postwa period, and required no conversion of capacity or disruption of d lS \" triburion facilities. This was particularly true of the automobile industry, which re- fused to convert or even to give up the unnecessary luxury of annua model changeovers until, in January 1942, the government ende pleasure-car manufacture for the duration of the war. But as a rcsu of reluctance to do this earlier, about two years of wartime productio by the automobile industry was lost and more pleasure cars ^' c manufactured in 1941 than in almost any year in history. In Decenine 1940, Walter P. Reuther, head of the United Automobile W-orKCi-' suggested that the unused capacity of the automobile industry (wn lC he estimated at 50 percent) be used to produce airplanes; this was B jected by both airplane and automobile manufacturers. The latter «"},{"pageNumber":728,"pageContent":"WORLD WAR II; TIDE OF AGGRESSION, 1939-1941 713 sisted that only 10 or 15 percent of their machine tools could be used m the manufacture of munitions. After the forced conversion of 1942, percent of these machine tools were used in this way, and the automobile industry eventually built two-thirds of all the combat air- plane engines produced in the United States between July 1940 and Au gust I945 . m most industries the government had little or no authority to com- P defense contracts to be carried out before civilian contracts, with e result that the latter were generally given preference until 1942. Ve n in such a vital product as machine tools, no effective system of •npulsory priorities for defense was set up until May 1942. This was 0 typical of the war mobilization that it can be said with assurance at no real mobilization was established until after June 1942. A year er ' D y July 1943, there had been an astonishing increase. We pro- ved only 16 light tanks in March 1941, and these were too light for ervice in Europe; our first medium tank (the General Grant) was rushed in April 1941, but thirty months later, late in 1943, we were urning out 3,000 tanks a month. In July 1940, the United States pro- ved 350 combat planes, and in March 1941, could do no better than such planes, but by December 1942, we produced 5,400 planes a nt h, and in August 1943, reached 7,500. A similar situation existed m shipbuilding. In all of 1939 the United States built only 28 ships ahng 342,000 tons, and in 1940 could raise this to no more than 53 P s of 641,000 tons. In September 1941, when the German U-boats re aiming to sink 700,000 tons a month, the United States completed ) r 7 ships of 64,450 tons. But among those seven ships of Septem- '94 1 was the first \"Liberty ship,\" a mass-production model largely e u on a British design. Two years later, in September 1943, the United e s launched 155 ships, aggregating 1,700,000 tons, and was in a posi- . to continue at this rate of five ships a day, or 10 million tons a year, \"definitely. m ust always be remembered that these impressive figures were c ned almost two years after the attack on Pearl Harbor at the end l0 4', and that for two years after the fall of France the United States f ilk a cr ' t ' ca ' diplomatic crisis with almost no military resources to ack on or to meet the piteous appeals for aid which came from am, China, Greece, Turkey, Sweden, and dozens of other countries. 5**pt for Britain, most of these appeals received little satisfaction. n a, for example, received only 48 planes in the first eight months of V4° and only $ 0 million worth of all kinds of arms and munitions in M'hole year 1940.

In September 194 0 ' in spite of the adverse effect it might have on Roosevelt's chances in the November election, the Administration persuaded the Congress to enact a Selective Service Act to build up the manpower of the armed forces through compulsion.

The Arsenal of Democracy idea meant that America would do it could to supply armaments and essential supplies to countries resistn g aggressors, especially to Britain. The British side of this idea was fleeted in a public statement of Winston Churchill's: \"Give us tools and we'll finish the job.\" These statements are of historical sigm cance because, even as thev were being made, the military experts both America and Britain were trying to persuade the political lew that material contributions from the United States to Britain, no mat how large, would not be sufficient: American fighting men would a be needed. The Arsenal of Democracy project, even if not adequate to de Hitler bv itself, faced the tremendous obstacles of Britain's inability pav and Britain's inability to ensure that war materials from the U nl States could be delivered in England.

The bill finally passed by a largely party-line vote; in the Hou of Representatives this vote was 260-161, with only 25 Democrats votin c against it and only 24 Republicans voting for it.

Behind this ^hole effort toward economic mobilization was a secret decision of Roosevelt's military advisers, made in the summer of 1941, that the war eould not be won unless the United States planned eventually to raise le n umber of men in its armed forces to 8,000,000. An 8,000,000-man army looked very remote in the summer 0^1941 s the 900,000 draftees provided by the Selective Sendee Act of 1940 approached the end of their year of training and eagerly began to prepare 0 disperse to their civilian activities again. To have permitted this would ndoubtedly have inflicted a dangerous blow to the preparedness pro- gram. Accordingly, the Roosevelt Administration asked the Congress to xtend the terms of sen-ice of these men. At once the isolationists were n u \" cry, and this time they found a greater response in American pub- c opinion. It seemed to many to be very unfair to keep in service for evera ' years men who, when they reported for service, had been as- fed that they need sen'e for only one year. The supporters of the ex- nsion argued that America's preparedness and security must take prec- ence over any such mistaken assurances. An Act extending the period selective-service training by an additional eighteen months passed the ongress on August 12, 1941, by the narrow margin of one vote, 203-202. nc e again, the Republicans were solidly opposed to the Act, only 21 oting for it, while 133 voted against it. s the voting on the extension of selective service was being counted, e historic Atlantic Conference of Roosevelt and Churchill was being d on the battleship Prince of Wales in a small harbor in Newfound- • After four days of conferences (August 9-12, 1941), the chiefs of government of the United States and Britain issued the so-called Atlantic arter as their first formal enunciation of war aims.

A second difference, which was soon pushed into the background, rested in the contrast between Churchill's desire for some statement of preference for a long-range postwar plan for an international organization to replace the League of Nations, and Roose- velt's preference for an immediate postwar system based on police action by the few Great Powers, or even bv a simple Anglo-American partner- ship. At any rate, Roosevelt was too reluctant to rouse the unsleeping dogs of isolationism to allow the Atlantic Conference to issue any public statement on international organization. The Atlantic Charter was issued to the world as soon as the conference ended; at least equal in importance were the simultaneous military an strategic conversations which were kept secret. Once again, these de- cided that the defeat of Germany must have priority over the defeat o Japan, but there was a wide difference of opinion on how Germ an ) could be defeated. The British had no plans or expectations for making any large-scale invasion of Europe with ground forces. Instead, tnev hoped that Germany could be worn down to defeat, after a very l° n e war, by blockade, aerial bombardment, subversive activity, and pr°P a ganda. Thev wanted large numbers of heavy bombers, and hoped American intervention in the war, as soon as possible, largely fo r propaganda value against German morale. Apparently, no one p ( >' n out that a German defeat by British methods would leave the Sovi armies supreme in all Europe, with no Axis, Anglo-American, or U> forces to oppose them. On military grounds alone, the Americans at the Atlantic Conrcre rejected the British theories. Thev rejected any immediate American tervention into the war on the grounds that the United States was sufficiently armed to be effective. The only immediate contribu which the United States could add by intervention, they felt, would in escorting convoys of British supply vessels to Europe. The Amen military experts rejected the idea that Germany could be defeated J blockade, propaganda, air attacks, or by anything less than a large- 5 ' invasion by ground forces. For this purpose the War Department Washington was planning an army of 8,000,000 men. An additional difference of opinion between the British and Amen emerged from the discussions regarding Japanese aggression. The r> rl wanted a joint or parallel message to Japan, accompanied, if possible- threatening naval movements, to demand a cessation of aggressive J7 anese actions. The Americans were reluctant, fearing to take any s \" which might speed up Japanese aggression and thus distract atten from the German problem; Roosevelt even said that continued with Japan was so essential that \"he would turn a deaf ear if Jap iU1 x"},{"pageNumber":734,"pageContent":"WORLD WAR II: TIDE OF AGGRESSION, 1939-1941 719 ! nt0 Thailand, bur not if they went into the Dutch East Indies.\" In the ' ter case he envisaged nothing more than economic warfare for a con- siderable period, immediately following the Atlantic Conference, Roosevelt was con- crned with two major European problems, leaving the rising tension \"31 Japan in Hull's hands. The two problems were naval escort of nvoys to Britain and military supplies for the Soviet Union. urm g the spring, summer, and autumn of 1941, Roosevelt was under nstant pressure from manv of his Cabinet to grab the bull by the horns ' d establish American naval escort of supply ships to Britain. At first he - lclde d to this pressure, but by July he became convinced that American r folic opinion would not accept convoy escort all the way to Britain, d substituted for this escort to the meridian of Iceland, with the argu- , en t that this was still within the Western Hemisphere. Orders to organ- e convoy escorts all the way to Britain had been issued on February tn - 1 o protect these, an Atlantic Fleet, under Admiral King, had been •\"Bated on February 1st. This was reinforced by three battleships, an 1 rcraft carrier, four cruisers, and numerous destroyers, transferred from e Pacific in May. In March, Roosevelt ordered two destroyer bases two seaplane bases to be constructed with Lend-Lease funds in ttnern Ireland and Scotland. At the same time, he gave Britain ten ^ as t Guard cutters to be based in Iceland, and seized possession of ' Kty-nve Axis and Danish ships anchored in American harbors. A month 1 er ' Greenland was declared to be in the Western Hemisphere, and United States took over its protection and began to construct bases. ne Red Sea was declared not to be a combat area, thus reopening it Tk Cr ' Can mercnant ships carrying supplies to Egypt (April 10, 1941). e \"nancial assets of the Axis Powers and of all occupied and belligerent ntr 'es in Europe were frozen, and Axis consulates in the United States ^ e closed (June 14-16, 1941).

This gave the Canadians and British routes of about 650 miles to cover on either end. By this time, Axis submarines had moved from the waters off the British Isles to the mid-Atlantic, where they were operating by a \"wolf-pack\" technique. Under this method, as soon as a convoy was discovered, a dozen or more submarines would assemble in its path and attack on the surface at night. This proved to be a very effective method, especially against inexperienced American escorts, which maintained too rigid stations too close to their convoy- But this method had the great weakness that it required extensive radio communication with Germany for orders; this revealed the locations 0 the U-boats, and eventually became a fatal weakness. American naval escort of British convoys could not fail to lead to a \"shooting war\" with Germany. The Roosevelt Administration did no shrink from this probability. The growing tension with Japan combine with the American strategic decision that Germany must be defeated o e \" fore Japan to compel an increasingly active policy in the Atlantic 1 order to avoid a situation where we would be at war in the Pacific vvni still at peace with Germany.

During this period, from June to December 1941, Roosevelt was also kept occupied by the problem of military aid for the Soviet Union. The Wazi forces which flung themselves on Russia, on June 22, 1941, were at we peak of their powers, and the Soviet Union was soon in grave need of an y aid it could get. Churchill, although filled with suspicions of the Soviet regime, or the good faith of its leaders, was willing to accept any- ° n e, \"even the devil,\" as he put it himself, as an ally against the Nazi Menace, and to extend whatever aid was available to such an ally. Roose- velt shared these ideas to a considerable extent, but the American people Were suspicious of Bolshevism, and American military experts were gen- erally agreed that the Soviet Union could not hold out against Hitler on g enough for any aid to be effective. Accordingly, it was several months before Roosevelt was in a position to make Lend-Lease supplies bailable to the Kremlin. The Nazi Attack on Soviet Russia, 1941-1942 n planning his attack on Soviet Russia, Hitler used the customary mtan strategic concepts; these gave priority to the destruction of en- / armies over the seizure and occupation of enemy territory and re- rces. This destruction was to be achieved (and quickly achieved, ording to Hitler), in a series of gigantic pincers movements of the le-arm type which had worked so well against Poland in 1939. In e operations a huge outer pincers of armored-division spearheads and 'muitaneous but smaller inner pincers of infantry-division columns u enclose a mass of enemy troops, the armored pincers cutting a ge segment of these off from their supplies and communications while inrantry columns would slice up the enclosed mass of enemy forces smaller masses willing to surrender.

Because of these German strategic ideas, no geographical objectives were given primary priority in the German plans. Secondary priority was given, at Hitler's insistence, to the capture of Leningrad in the north and to the capture of Kiev and the Caucasus to the south. These geographical objectives were set in order to link up with the Finns and cut the Mur- mansk railway in the north, and to capture, or at least cut off from Rus- sian armies, the Soviet oil centers in the south. The capture of Moscow was, by Hitler's direct orders, given only tertiary priority in the German strategic plans. The German generals disagreed with Hitler's geographic conceptions, and insisted that Moscow be made the chief geographic goal of the Ger- man advance because it was the vital railroad center of European Russia; it was also an important industrial center, and contained the heart and brain of the whole Soviet autocracy. Its capture would, according to the generals, cripple Russia's ability to shift troops and supplies north and south and would thus make it possible to isolate, for easier conquest, the Leningrad or the Kiev fronts. Moreover, its capture would paralyze the overcentralized system of Soviet tyranny, and strike such a blow to Bol- shevik prestige that it would probably be unable to survive. In the first three months of the campaign of 1941 and for all of the campaign of 1942, Hitler resisted the pressure from his generals and in- sisted that the maximum German effort should be devoted to the two areas originally set in the north and the south. Only in September 194'' when it was too late for a successful assault on Moscow, did Hitler rec- ognize that his own geographic objectives could not be achieved, with the result that he fell back on his generals' advice for an attack on Moscow This dispersal and shifting of geographic objectives, combined witi German inability to destroy the Soviet armies completely, brought Ger- many to the point which Hitler had always insisted must be avoiox above all else: a two-front war of attrition by a Germany which wa nowhere near total economic mobilization. German authorities estimated that Russia had over 200 divisions (° which 30 to J5 Mere in the Far East), with 8,000 aircraft of diverse quality, and 15,000 tanks, mostly light or obsolescent.

The \\ ole German front, from north to south, had seven infantry armies and ^°ur panzer armies organized in this alternating fashion, with two in- antry armies forming each end of the line, and the satellite forces on the xtreme flanks (Finns to the north, the others to the south). he Soviet Union was warned of the impending Nazi attack from ashington and London, as well as by its own spies, and had the exact at e of the assault almost as soon as it was set in Berlin.

Moscow made no effort to escape the Nazi pincers bv with- awing its forces from their exposed frontier positions, but continued 0 ^ope that its abject economic collaboration with Hitler would lead to cancel the attack orders, in recognition of the fact that he could ain more, in an economic sense, from collaborating in peace than from nquest in war. This hope was futile, because Hitler had such a gigantic respect for Russia's fighting powers that he expected a complete Ger- th ^ lctor . y in about six weeks. So convinced was Hitler on this point a he flatly rejected, in June, again in July, and once again in August, ggestions from the chief of the Great General Staff that any prepara- ns be made for fighting in winter. For this refusal Germany was to su ner bitterly. itler's estimates about the weakness of the Soviet armies and the vity of the approaching campaign were generally shared by military G «I throughout the world.

This resulted from the fact that Hitlers generals did not share the Fuhrer's strategic ideas, and had disposed the German forces so that, in effect, thev overruled his directives and g;\" c preponderance to their own goal, the capture of Moscow. For this rea- son they had given two of their four panzer armies to Field Marshal Fedor von Bock's Army Group Center, and one to each of the other army groups. Since the Russians had massed their strength in the south, Ger- man Army Group South, under Gerd von Rundstedt, had only 800 tanks, while his Soviet opponent, .Marshal S. M. Budennv had 2,000. The brilliant success of the German Armv Group Center led the Ger- man General Staff and Hitler to change their minds, but in opposite directions. The weakness of the Soviet defense persuaded Bock to adopt a plan, advanced by Guderian, that Armv Group Center abandon furth er efforts at pincers encirclements and send its armored units on a straight all-out drive to Moscow, one hundred miles away. About the same time, Hitler decided to strengthen the advance of Army Groups North and South, by directing the efforts of the two panzer armies of Army Group Center awav from their own front and onto the fronts of the two flank- ing army groups. This would have left Army Group Center with infantry forces only, thus slowing its advance and restricting its operations to tactical mopping-up activities, but it would have increased the ability 0 the flanking army groups to close pincer envelopments by giving eac ° them the use of two panzer armies. By Directive No. 33, on July i9 r ' Hitler issued orders for this change. Although the generals resisted an stalled in carrying out these instructions, the advance on Moscow w broken.     ,     General Franz Haider wrote in his diary on July 26th: \"The Fuhrer analysis, which at many points is unjustly critical of the Field Comman 1 indicates a complete break with the strategy of large operational concep tions. You cannot beat the Russians with operational successes, he argu - because they simply do not know when thev are defeated. On that a count it will be necessary to destroy them bit by bit, in small encircling actions of a purely tactical character.\" Against these ideas of Hitie his generals argued for weeks, in vain. On August 21st, Hitler issu Directive No. 34. It began: \"The proposals of the Army High Comman for the continuance of the operations in the east, dated August i«S not conform to my intentions. . . . The principal object is not the cap ture of Moscow.\" In place of this, it set the following objectives: seize the Crimea and the Dombas coal mines, to cut off the Caucasian supplies, to isolate Leningrad, and to make direct contact with the rtn As a consequence of the shift of emphasis to the south, German Ar , Group South completed a colossal envelopment east of Kiev (August 24 September 21).

Most 01 these were Ukrainians, and the majority were eager to fight with the Nazis against the Stalinist regime of the Soviet Union. If the Nazis had een willing to cooperate with this movement, and to treat these de- serters in a decent fashion, it is extremely likely that the flood of Russian eserters would have become an overwhelming torrent and the Moscow re gime would have collapsed. Instead, the Nazis, led by Hitler, resolutely refused to adopt the role of \"Liberator of the Slavs,\" and instead insisted on Paying the role of \"Annihilator of the Slavs.\" The arrogance, sadism, racism of the Nazi system soon presented itself in a form as hateful t0 tlle average Slav as Stalinism itself.

Prisoners of war and civilians ef e rounded up bv the millions and deported to German slave-labor camps where they were starved, frozen, and beaten into subhuman dere- ct s at the very time that thev were expected to work, fifteen or more 0Urs a day, on Nazi war production. Those inhabitants of conquered teas who escaped deportation or imprisonment generally were deprived niost of their possessions, especially of their food stores and livestock, industrial equipment which had not been removed by the retreating ov 'et armies was stolen or destroyed by the Nazis. The deserters who fished to fight with the Nazis against Stalin would have been welcomed \\ many German Army officers, but their use in this fashion was gener- y discouraged and frequently forbidden by the Nazi political leaders c h as Hitler or Himmler. In spite of this, some Russian units in the azi armies were formed, although generally they were used only for guard or garrison duties. The size of this movement of anti-Stalinist de- ert ers can be judged from the fact that, in spite of the obstacles we have Mentioned, the number of such deserters serving in the Nazi armed Wees reached 900,000 in June 1944. These were nominally under the sadership of a renegade Soviet general, A. A. Vlasov, who had served as w °viet military adviser to Chiang Kai-shek in China in 1938, with the an K of major general, and had been captured by the Nazis when serving ^ \" e puty commander of the Volkhov front, in June 1942.

It should be recognized by Americans today, as it was recognized by the Japanese leaders at the time, that the Japanese aggressions of 1941 which cul- minated in the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7th were based on fear and weakness and not on arrogance and strength. To be sure, the earlier aggressions which began in .Manchuria in 1931 and in North China in 1937 had been arrogant enough. The Japanese had been supremely confident of their ability to conquer all China, if necessary, even as late as 1939. As a consequence, their advance had been accompanied by brutality against the Chinese, by various actions to drive all Europeans and all European economic enterprises out of China, and by insults and humiliations to Europeans found in China, especially in Shanghai. By 1939 all of this was beginning to change. The attack on China had bogged down completely. The Japanese economy was beginning to tot- ter under a combination of circumstances, including the exhausting et \" fort to strangle China and to administer a fatal blow to the retreating r 1 n's Chinese government by octopus tactics, the reorganization of Japan home industry from a light basis to a heavy industrial plant (for whJc Japan lacked the necessary resources), the gigantic capital investment m Manchuria and North China, the growing restrictions on Japanese trade imposed by Western countries, and, finally, the combination of a rap- idly growing population with acute material shortages. Problems sue as these might have driven many nations, even in the West, to desperate action. In Japan the situation was made more critical by the large-sea diversion of manpower and resources from consumption to capita - formation at a very high rate. And, finally, all this was taking place 1 a country which placed a high esteem on military arrogance. In theory, of course, Japan might have sought to remedy its maten shortages in a peaceful way, by seeking to increase Japan's foreign trad , exporting increasing amounts of Japanese goods to pay for rising Jap anese imports. In fact, such a policy had obvious weaknesses. The wor depression after 1929 and the growth of economic autarchy in all cou tries, including the United States, made it very difficult to increase Jap\" anese exports. The excessively high American Smoot-Hawley tariff ° 1930, although not so intended, seemed to the Japanese to be an aggre sive restriction on their ability to live. The \"imperial preference\" r e g lations of the British Commonwealth had a similar consequence. Sin Japan could not defend itself against such economic measures, it sorted to political measures.

And, in such a war, in view of its economic weak- ness, Japan could hardly hope to win. These stages were confused an u delayed over a full decade of years (1931-1941), by indecision and divided counsels in both Japan and the Western Powers. In the process J a pan found a considerable advantage in the parallel aggressions of Italy a nd Germany. It also found a considerable disadvantage in the fact that Japan's imports were vital necessities to her, while her exports were vital necessities to no one. This meant that Japan's trade could be cut off or reduced by anyone, to Japan's great injury, but at much smaller cost to tn e other nation. 1 he steps leading to open war between Japan and the Western Powers JJ'ere delayed by the long-drawn indecision of the Sino-Japanese War. 0r years Japan hoped to find a solution for its economic and social Problems in a decisive victory over China, while in the same years the estern Powers hoped for an end to Japanese aggression bv a Japanese eteat in China. Instead, the struggle in that area dragged on without a ecision. The Western Powers were too divided at home and among eniselves, too filled with pacifism and mistaken political and economic eas to do anything decisive about China, especially when open war was •^possible and anything less than war would injure China as well as J a pan. Thus, no sanctions were imposed on Japan for its aggression on anchuria in 1931 or for its attack on North China in 1937. The Amer- ^ a n Neutrality Act was not applied to this conflict because President oosevelt adopted the simple legalistic expedient of failing to \"find\" a ar in the Far East. But the mere existence of laws which might have posed economic sanctions or economic retaliation on Japan revealed that country the basic weakness of its own position. '937 Japan received a series of lessons in the precarious state of its fategic-economic position. In the first half of that year, as background r its growing military pressure on China, Japan bought a record amount American scrap iron and steel, 1.3 million metric tons in six months. grtation to curtail this supply, either by applying the Neutrality Act the Sino-Japanese conflict or by some lesser action, was growing in e United States. Early in October 1937, President Roosevelt caused a ntroversy by a speech suggesting a \"quarantine\" of aggressor nations. ationist sentiment in the United States, especially in the Midwest, was strong to allow the administration to take any important steps to- . ard su ch a \"quarantine.\" Nevertheless, Stimson, who had been Amer- n secretary of state at the time of the Manchurian crisis in 1931, made a publi ic appeal for an embargo on the shipment of war materials to Pan.

There was considerable talk of economic sanctions, but no Great Power was willing to light the fuse on that stick of dyna- mite, so the occasion lapsed, and nothing was done. But the lesson was not wasted on Japan; it intensified its efforts to build up Japanese power to a position where it could use political action to defend itself against any economic reprisals. Naturally, the political actions it took in this direction served only to hasten economic reprisals against itself, especially by the United States, the world's most devoted defender of the statu* quo in the Far East and the onlv Great Power in any position, especially after Hitler's attacks, to adopt an active policy against Japan. Japan could have achieved little toward a political solution of its prob- lems if it had not been for the aggressions of Italy and Germany on the other side of the world. A full year before the Brussels Conference, on November 25, 1936, Japan had joined the league of aggressors known as the Anti-Comintern Pact. Discussions seeking to strengthen this ar- rangement into a full German-Japanese alliance went on for years, but were not concluded until September 1940. Hitler was not sure whether he wanted Japanese support against the Western democracies or against the Soviet Union, and, accordingly! sought an agreement which could be swung either way, while Japan was interested in a German alliance only if it ran against the Sovie Union. At the same time, Germany objected to the Japanese war on China, since this prevented Japan's strength from being directed agains either of Germany's possible foes, and jeopardized German econonu interests in China. All these difficulties continued, although Ribbentrops advent to the post of foreign minister in Berlin in February 1938 in- augurated a period of wholehearted cooperation with Japan in Chin.', replacing Neurath's earlier efforts to maintain some kind of neutral ba - ance in the Sino-Japanese War. The German military advisers wit Chiang Kai-shek were withdrawn, although some of them had been i their positions for ten years and were likely to be replaced by Sovic advisers; the German ambassador was withdrawn from China, and t protection of German interests was generally left to lesser officials, using Japanese officials in areas under Japanese occupation; the Japanese regim in Manchukuo was explicitly- recognized (20 February 1938); all ship ments of German war materials to China (which reached a value almost 83 million marks in 1937) were ended, and incompleted contra totaling 282 million marks were canceled; the Japanese claim that the attack on Nationalist China was really an anti-Communist action, though recognized as a fraud in Berlin, was tacitly accepted; and earlier German efforts to mediate peace between China and Japan cease In spite of these concessions, Japan continued its efforts to cui German economic enterprises in China, along with those of other vV£ ern nations.

This was regarded in Tokyo as such a blow to the prestige of the Japanese government that the prime minister resigned. In the meantime the American government began to tighten the eco- nomic pincers on Japan just as Japan was seeking to tighten its military P'ucers on China. In the course of 1939 Japan was able to close all the r °utes from the outside into China except through Hong Kong, across r ench Indochina, and along the rocky and undeveloped route from Ur nia to Chungking. The American government retaliated with eco- n °nuc warfare. In June 1938 it established a \"moral embargo\" on the shipment of aircraft or their parts and bombs to Japan by simply re- questing American citizens to refuse to sell these articles. Earlv in 1939 ar ge American and British loans to China sought to strengthen that °untry's collapsing financial system. In September 1939 Washington ° ave the necessarv six-month notice to cancel the 1911 commercial treaty ltn Japan; this opened the door to all kinds of economic pressure a gainst Japan. At the same time, the \"moral embargo\" was extended to even named raw materials which were vital to Japan's war machine. n Ueceniber this embargo was extended to cover light metals and all achmery or plans for making aviation gasoline. hi general, there was considerable pressure in the United States, both Sl ue the administration and elsewhere, to increase American economic nctl °ns against Japan. Such a policy was opposed by the isolationists me country, bv our diplomatic agents in Tokyo, and by our quasi- ' les > Britain, France, and the Netherlands. These diverse opinions agreed at economic sanctions could be enforced, in the long run, only by war. 0 put it bluntly, if Japan could not get petroleum, bauxite, rubber, and n hy trade, it could be prevented from seizing areas producing these products only by force.

There was a steady increase in America's economic pressure on Japan by exten- sions of the \"moral embargo,\" by the growth of financial obstacles, and by increasing purchasing difficulties, presumably based on America's re- armament program. Japan continued to advance in China with brusque disregard of West- ern interests, citizens, or property. By the end of 1939, Japan controlled all the chief cities, river valleys, and railroad lines of eastern China, but faced constant guerrilla opposition in rural areas and had no control over the deep interior of China, which remained loyal to Chiang Kai-sheks government in far-off Chungking on the Upper Yangtze in southwestern China. In March 1940 the Japanese set up a puppet Chinese governmen at Nanking, but the reality of its power deceived no one. In the winter of 1939-1940, Japan began to make vigorous commercia demands on the Netherlands East Indies. These demands, chiefly con ' cerned with petroleum and bauxite, were increased after the German victories in France and the Low Countries. From these victories and from Hull's doctrinaire refusal to encourage any Japanese hope that they could win worthwhile American concessions from a more moderat policy, the advocates of extremism in Japan gained influence. A Japanese demand was made on France, following the latter's defeat by Germany, to allow Japanese troops to enter northern Indochina, in order to cu off supplies going to China. This was conceded at once by the Vichy government. At the same time (June 1940), Britain received a deman to withdraw its troops from Shanghai and close the Burma Road t Chinese imports. When Hull refused to cooperate with Britain, either in forcing Japan to desist or in any policy aiming to win better Japan eS behavior by concessions, Britain withdrew from Shanghai and close the Burma Road for three months. Just at that moment a powerful new weapon against Japan was adde to the American arsenal, by an amendment to the National Defense A c giving the President authority to embargo the export of supplies w' nlC he judged to be necessary to the defense of the United States. The m presidential order under this new authority required licenses for many goods which Japan needed, including aluminum, airplane parts, all arm or munitions, optical supplies, and various \"strategic\" materials, but le petroleum and scrap iron unhindered.

The real error in the American negotiations with Japan in 1940-1941 Was a double one. On the one hand, there was no correlation between ° u r demands on Japan and our actual power in the Pacific, since our demands were vastly more extensive than our strength. On the other \" a nd, there was no correlation between our strategic plans and our dip- °rnatic activity, with the consequence that there was no correlation between our German policy and our Japanese policy. The American «»tegic plans were based on the premise that Germanv must be defeated efore Japan. From this perfectly correct premise followed several corol- anes which were not fully grasped by American leaders, especially y the nonmilitary leaders. One of these corollaries provided that Amer- 1Ca m ust not get into war with Japan before it got into war with Ger- ^ny, for, if it did so, it would either have to abandon its strategic plans and proceed to fight Japan or declare war on Germany itself. The . cn greater danger from Germany, and especially from a German victory over either Britain or the Soviet Union, made the first of these nacceptable, while American public opinion would never have accepted n American declaration of war against Germany when we were already a state of war with Japan. A second corollarv from all these condi- 10ns was that American diplomatic pressure on Japan must be timed terms of American-German relations and not in terms of American- Japanese relations in order to avoid pushing Japan into desperate action etore American-German relations had passed the breaking point. As we shall see, American diplomatic pressure on Japan was increased n the basis of moral outrage, high-flown principles, incidental retalia- ° n > and an unrealistic conception of international legality, without any tempt to coordinate this pressure either with our relations to Germany r> what was even worse, with our actual power in the Pacific. Hull was le to do this because his attitudes were generally shared by the civilian ea ds of the two service departments, by Stimson as secretary of war, a nd by Knox as secretary of the naw; thus the more realistic views of e military and naval leaders, and their better appreciation of the impli- wns of America's strategic plans, did not have their proper weight on ^erica's policy-making on the Cabinet level or even at the White se.

Moreover, it w as impossible to reach anv agreement with the Chinese Nationalist govern- ment which would allow Japan to retain its \"face\" by covering a real withdrawal from China with an apparent diplomatic triumph of some sort. The advocates of an aggressive policy in Japan were divided among the insignificant group who still believed that an all-out assault on China could be brought to a successful conclusion and the more influential groups who would have sought to redeem the stalemate in China by shifting the offensive against either Soviet Siberia or the rich Anglo - Dutch possessions of .Malaysia and Indonesia. In the long run, the group which advocated a drive to the south was bound to prevail, because Malaysia and Indonesia were obviously weak and rich, while Soviet Siberia lacked those items (such as petroleum, rubber, or tin) which Japan most urgently needed, and it had demonstrated its power in tn e battles of 1938-1939. Germany, which originally encouraged the Jap\" anese to move southward against British Malaysia and then, when it ^as too late, sought to redirect the Japanese blow against Siberia, played an insignificant role in Japan's policy. The decision to move southwar , where the defense was weaker and the prizes so much greater, was mad in an ambiguous and halfhearted way in the summer of 1941. The critical turning point was probably during the last week in July. During the six-week period, March 12-April 22, Matsuoka, the nr eating foreign minister, was absent from Tokyo on a visit to Berlin ai to Moscow. In the German capital he was advised to make no politic agreements with the Soviet Union, because of the imminent approac of war between that country and Germany. Matsuoka at once went Moscow, where he signed a Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact on Ap 13, 1941. In the meantime, in March, Japanese diplomats won speci economic concessions in Siam, while in June the nine-month-old era discussions with the Netherlands East Indies broke down without J>'P pon obtaining anv of the concessions it desired.

On July 21, 1941, Japan's threats won from Vichv France the right to move troops into southern Indochina. This was a threat to British Malaya rather than to the Burma Road in China. Within a week, on July 26, 1941, the United States froze all Japanese financial assets in the United States, virtually ending trade between the two countries. The numbers of the British Commonwealth issued similar orders, while the ^etherlands Indies established special licenses for all exports to Japan. ^° licenses were issued for vital commodities like oil or bauxite. In the ante week, an American military mission went to China, and the Philip- P lr >e Army was incorporated into the American Army. , As a result of these pressures, Japan found itself in a position where s oil reserves would be exhausted in two vears, its aluminum reserves ] n seven months. The chief of the General Staff of the Japanese Navy O'd the emperor that if Japan resorted to a war to break this blockade lf Would be verv doubtful that it could win. The president of the Jap- nese Planning Board confirmed this gloomy opinion. The armed forces sisted that Japan had a choice between a slow decline to extinction nder economic pressure or war which might allow it to break out of !t s predicament. The navy had little hope of victory in such a war, but greed with this analvsis. It w r as also agreed that war, if it came, must e gin before the middle of December, when weather conditions would ecome too adverse to permit amphibious belligerent operations; it was ear that economic pressure was too damaging to allow Japan to post- Pone such operations until the resumption of good weather in 1942. ccordingly, the decision was made to make war in 1941, but to con- •nue negotiations with the United States until late October. If an agree- e nt could be reached by that date, the preparations for war could be s pended; otherwise the negotiations would be ended and the advance • open war continued. Matsuoka, the foreign minister, who was opposed continuing the negotiations with the United States, was dropped from e _Cabinet on Julv 16th; from that date on, the civilian portion of the met desperately sought to reach an agreement in Washington, while military portion calmly prepared for war. n the course of 1941, Japan's preparations for war were gradually • panded from a project to close the southern routes into China by an ack on Malaya, to an attack on the United States.

Having given the attack on Malaya and Indonesia the preference ove any possible attack on Siberia, the Japanese leaders accepted the fact tna this would mean war with Britain and the United States.

Here, once again, the Japanese misjudged American psychology. The negotiations in Washington between Kichisaburo Nomura and Secretary Hull were among the strangest diplomatic discussions ever carried on. Although Nomura probably was not informed of the Jap- anese plans to make war, he could not have failed to infer them because ne had received instructions that he must reach an agreement by late \"October if peace were to be preserved. He found it impossible to reach SUcn an agreement because Hull's demands were extreme, and his own superiors in Tokyo were unwilling to make any political concessions to win a relaxation of economic restrictions. I he Americans had a clear view of the situation because they had token the secret Japanese codes and generally had Nomura's instructions r om Tokyo before he did. Thus the Americans knew that Nomura had no powers to yield on any vital political issue, that he had been given a deadline in October, and that war would begin if he failed to obtain relaxation of the economic embargo before that deadline. They did not, ovvever, have any details on the Japanese military plans, since these were °t communicated by radio, and thev did not realize that these plans eluded an attack on Pearl Harbor. In the course of November Amer- can Naval Intelligence knew that Japanese armed forces were mobiliz- n g and moving southward; by November 20th it became clear that a S K force of the navy, including four of the largest Japanese aircraft atriers, had vanished. At the end of November intercepted Japanese essages showed clearly that the negotiations were no longer of signif- cance. In early December these showed that the Japanese Embassy in ashington had been ordered to destroy all its codes and to prepare its staff for departure. Tl in e negotiations between Hull and Nomura were lengthy, technical, nd hopeless. In essence they boiled down to the conclusion that Amer- 3 Would not relax its economic restrictions on Japan unless (1) Japan promised to refrain from acts of force in the southwest Pacific area; (2) Japan agreed to violate its treaty with Germany to permit the United ates to support Britain even to the point of war with Germany with- any Japanese intervention on the side of Germany; and (3) that Pan would agree to withdraw its armed forces from Indochina and 0ni China and restore equality of economic opportunity in the latter °untry on a schedule to be worked out later.

Y   Lying north of Australia in a great curve from Singapore to New Guinea was the Malay Barrier, originally intended to form the south- ern perimeter of the Japanese defense area. Like beads on a necklace across a distance of 3 500 miles were stretched dozens of islands: Sumatra, Java, a 1, Lumbok, r lores, Timor, New Guinea, and others. These were taken so rapidly by the Japanese octopus that the straits between the various islands were closed before some Allied ships could escape through to the south. Five Allied cruisers and many destroyers were caught in this way and sunk in the week of February 2 6, \\ 942; Sumatra Java, and Timor surrendered by March 9 th ; and Netherlands forces were wiped out, British forces withdrew to Ceylon, and the few surviving American vessels limped home for repairs. Rangoon, the Burmese capital, sur- rendered on March 8th, and exactly a month later the triumphant Japa- nese naval forces swept westward to strike at Ceylon. In the first week of April, Holy Week of , 942 , Japanese Admiral Chuichi Nagumo, who had led the attack on Pearl Harbor, made a similar attack on Ceylon, sinking the British earner Hermes, two heavy cruisers, and many'lesser vessels (including 136,000 tons of merchant ships). At this dark moment, mid-April of ,942, the tide of battle in the Pacific began to turn The three American aircraft carriers which had been spared at Pearl Harbor {Lexington, Enterprise, and Saratoga) were joined by one of the two carriers from the Atlantic (Yorktoivn). These, with cruisers, destroyers submarines, and supply ships, became nuclei for task forces which relentlessly prowled the Pacific. On April 2, itf* the new earner Hornet, with sixteen United States Army Mitchell bombers (B-25 s) wedged on its deck, sailed from San Francisco with a message for Tokyo. Escorted by the Enterprise Task Force to a point 850 miles from the Japanese capital (and thus 2,100 miles from their assigned landing fields in China) the sixteen B- 2S 's were taken off the Plunging deck of the carrier by their army crews\" of eighty men led by Lieutenant Colonel James H.

Some of this came from °ur control over the Japanese codes, but much of the most critical in- dulgence came from other sources which have never been revealed, \"rough these channels, while Admiral William Halsey was still en °ute back from the Tokyo raid with two carriers, American naval au- °nties learned of two Japanese projects. The first of these planned to * n d an invasion force from Rabaul in New Britain, north of New uinea, to capture Port Moresby on the southern shore of New Guinea. \"t second plan hoped to extend the Japanese defense perimeter eastw- ard by seizing the Aleutian Islands and Midway Island in the northern scific.

On May \"1 as the Japanese invasion force for Port Moresby came into this area °m the northwest, it was intercepted by an American task force, in- udmg the carriers Lexington and Yorktown.

Needless to say, long and bitter exertions were needed to push the three aggressor states back from their points of farthest advance. The Battle of Midway arose from a Japanese trap which was suppose\" to destroy the rest of the Pacific Fleet but resulted quite differently- Whatever illusions the Japanese Army may have had, the Japanese Navy fully recognized that it could not possibly win in the Pacific unti the American fleet was totally destroyed. To achieve this, a trap was se to draw the fleet out from Pearl Harbor by the threat of a Japanese amphibious invasion of Midway Island from the southwest. When the Americans hurried out to attack this invasion fleet at Midway, they were to have been destroyed by the planes from four Japanese carriers lyi n & in ambush 200 miles northwest of Midway. The ambush was reversed be- cause Admiral Chester Nimitz at Pearl Harbor had a clear picture 0 the Japanese plans and sent his own carriers out to spring on the Japanes carriers from a point 200 miles northeast of their position. The American counterambush worked because of a most extraordinary series of fortunate chances. The four Japanese carriers expected the American counterattack to come from Pearl Harbor after several days delay, and accordingly felt free to use their own carrier planes to born- bard the Midway defenses, softening them up for the benefit of the inva ing force coming up on Midway from the southwest. These bombardmen planes had returned from Midway to their carriers and were still fev- erishly refueling on the flight decks when the American carrier \"strike came in: 116 planes from Enterprise and Hornet were followed short, after by 35 planes from Yorktoivn. Caught in a horrible tactical position, the Japanese defended so ski fully that 37 out of 41 American torpedo-bombers were lost, but, as wa after wage of dive-bombers continued to come in, the Japanese deren was \"saturated,\" and soon all four carriers were sinking in flames. Belo the fourth Japanese carrier went down, it sent off 40 planes which t pedoed the Yorktovn. The American carrier was incapacitated a mistakenly abandoned, so that it was easily sunk by a Japanese subniari two days later. This loss, even in combination with the loss of the Lexti b ton in the Coral Sea a month earlier, was a cheap price to pay f° r f destruction of five Japanese carriers in these two areas in the space five weeks, since the United States had the industrial capacity to repia its losses, while Japan did not.    ,    Two events of November 1942, the British victory at El Alamein an the Anglo-American invasion of French North Africa, provided tactic lessons and strategic reversals fully as great as those provided m"},{"pageNumber":762,"pageContent":"WORLD WAR II: EBB OF AGGRESSION, 1941-1945 747 Pacific five months earlier.

In addition, a difficult problem arose about the question of political cooperation with the French authorities in North An\" lC:L The British had placed most of their faith in General de Gaulle, but it soon became clear that he had verv little support in North Africa, and was too difficult and uncooperative personally to be made part of the inva- sion plans.

Hitler's Russian campaign 1942 was very similar to that of 1941 except that his original plan restricted to a single aim: to capture the oil fields of the Caucasus. German forces, consisting of 44 infantry, 10 armored, and 6 motori divisions, along with 43 satellite divisions and 700 planes, were to along the north shore of the Black Sea, pass through a congested tleneck at Rostov, and capture the Soviet oil fields (the chief of which, Baku, was 700 miles beyond Rostov). To protect the long northern »' of this drive, other German attacks were ordered farther north tow- Voronezh and toward Stalingrad on the Volga River. The German fensive did reach the Caucasus, advancing almost as far as Grozny 14 miles beyond Rostov), but did not capture the chief oil fields. A the 1941 offensive, scores of Soviet divisions were destroyed and l dreds of thousands of Soviet prisoners were captured, but no vital lO) •* was inflicted on the Soviet Union.   1   Suddenly, on July 18th, after seven weeks of advance, Hitler ord e the capture of Stalingrad.

While this was going on at Stalingrad from December 1942 through January 1943, another Soviet offensive, striking down from the north- asc toward Rostov, was trving to cut off the whole German force in le Caucasus by capturing the citv of Rostov and thus closing the bot- e 'ieck north of the Sea of Azov.

A week later itler promoted him to field marshal, and two days later he surrendered. 2 7°.ooo Germans originally surrounded, over 100,000 were dead, H,ooo had been evacuated by air, and 93,000 surrendered. Ten days after aulus's surrender, the Germans abandoned Rostov. For the next two ee ks it looked as if a new Soviet offensive from Voronezh might cut n the whole of German Army Group South, but Field Marshal von Man- ln succeeded in reestablishing a stable defensive line by April 1st, just °ut at the line where the German offensive of 1942 had begun eleven Months earlier.

In contrast with this, the German armor divisions were kept idle for lack of fuel for weeks at a time as early 1942, and both operational and training flights of the Luftwaffe were dr tically curtailed from 1942 onward. The lack of fuel was so acute t Hitler decided, late in 1942, to decommission most of the surface vess of the German Navy. When Grand Admiral Raeder protested too vig ously, he was removed from his position as head of the navy, and rep' a by the U-boat specialist Admiral Karl Doenitz, in January, 1943- All these events should have made it clear that Germany could possibly win the war, but for the next two years Hitler and his mediate associates became increasingly fanatical, increasingly merci < and increasingly remote from reality.

But the role of this / ea r as a turning point in the conflict with Germany was much greater nan this, for, behind the scenes, the military successes of the year forced Visions on strategic plans and postwar projects whose implications are \"l being worked out today. And still very much behind the scenes, these strategic and postwar plans revealed deep fissures and rivalries among th e three Allied Powers. Rivalries among the members of a coalition are always to be expected nd are usually, and necessarily, kept secret during the war itself. In the econd World War they were most significant in the year 1943. In e years before 1943 these disputes were more concerned with strategic Visions than with postwar planning, while in the later years, when rategy had been set, postwar plans were the chief causes of disputes. The • ear '943- however, had its full share of both, since the major strategic c 'sions were made in that year, and these decisions, in themselves, Pla\\ cd a major role in determining the nature of the postwar world. n the years 1941-1943 the chief strategic questions were concerned ltn two problems: (1) Should the European war against Germany \"itniuc to receive priority over the Pacific war against Japan? and ) should Germany he attacked, indirectly, by aerial bombardment, • \" cl<a ue, and guerrilla forces or should Europe be invaded with large aat ry forces, either from England directly across the Channel to e stern Europe or from the Mediterranean through southern Europe? le an swers given to these strategic questions, especially the last one, r yw a major role in establishing the postwar political settlement in turopc. the earlier years a certain direction was given to postwar planning .

Most of the secret discussions leading up to the publication of tnl declaration on January 1, 1942 were concerned with verbal or p r0 \" cedural issues, but some of these were symbolic of future problems. There was considerable discussion as to the order in w hich the signatures should be affixed to the document; the decision to rank them in V\" groups, with the four \"Great Powers\" of the United States, the Unite Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China followed by twenty-two lesser states in alphabetical order, was an early indication of the similar divisio which still exists in the United Nations today. The inclusion of China, in spite of its obvious weakness, among the Great Powers was a co cession made to the United States by the other Powers. The Americ leaders, from Roosevelt down, insisted that China was, or at least sho be, a Great Power, although the onlv evidence they could find to s p port this argument was its larger population. The Americans seenieo hope that by encouragement and reiteration, or perhaps even by i nv cation, China could be made into a Great Power, able to dominate Far East after the defeat of Japan.   .   Other notable features of this United Nations Declaration were: I i the fact that De Gaullist France was excluded from the signers in or not to recognize it as a government, (2) the fact that the Un States was ranked first among the Great Powers, and (3) the diftic in wording the declaration so that Japan, with which the Soviet V was not at war, should not specifically be included among the enemy |( yet, at the same time, should not be excluded from the \"brutal fo r which were condemned.    . .

In general, the British found themselves Jn a difficult position between the high and proclaimed principles of the Americans and the low and secret interests of the Russians. Because of American pressure, Eden avoided any territorial commitments, and per- vaded Stalin to accept a twenty-year treaty of alliance with Britain. *his Anglo-Soviet Treaty of May 26, 1942 had no territorial provisions, a,1 u included a statement that the signers would \"act in accordance with lle two principles of not seeking territorial aggrandizement for them- selves and of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States.\" Although the Soviet Union accepted the terms of the British alliance, In 1942 their suspicions of the West were still high, and their relations *lth Britain became increasingly unfriendly, reaching a critical stage by '943- In Moscow there was fear that the West wished to protract the ^ar in order to bleed both Germany and the Soviet Union to death. It w as feared that this end could be obtained if American supplies to Rus- Sla We re placed at a level sufficiently high to keep Russia fighting but in- sufficiently high to allow her to defeat Hitler. To avoid this, Moscow continued to insist, with unreasonable repetition, on the need to increase -end-Lease supplies to it and, above all, on the need to open a second font on the Continent by an immediate Anglo-American invasion of urope from England. Judging, perhaps, that American psychology v ould work along the same lines of \"power politics\" as their own, a istakc which the Japanese, with considerably greater reason, had made the months before Pearl Harbor, the Russians could not conceive that e United States would grant sufficient aid to Russia to permit a speedy .at °f Hitler, since such a policy, almost inevitably, would leave the etorious Soviet armies supreme in eastern, and probably also in central, Europe. . As a matter of fact, while some Americans unquestionably did think ter ms of \"power politics\" and may, in a few cases, have gone so far to prefer a Hitler victory over Stalin to a Stalin victory over Hitler, 11 people were very remote from the centers of power in the American t> v ernment.

Immediately after the signing of die Anglo-Soviet alliance, Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov came to Wash- ington to urge the need for an immediate second front in Europe- Although such a project would have been unwise, if not impossible, m 1942, the White House communique of June 11, 1942 sought to satisfy the Russians and to frighten the Germans by saving that \"full under- standing was reached with regard to the urgent tasks of creating a second front in Europe in 1942.\" In the early summer of 1942 Soviet messages to Washington and to London continued to insist on the need for an immediate second front Jfl Western Europe in order to reduce the Nazi military pressure on the Soviet forces. Recognizing the impossibility of such a venture in 1942, the Anglo-Americans sought to relieve the pressure on Russia by landing at a place where the German defense would not be so strong. It was this desire which resulted in the decision of July 25, 1942 to invade Noiw Africa in November. Having made the decision to substitute this project for any possible cross-Channel attack in 1942, it was necessary to conve} the news to the Soviet Union. Churchill undertook this delicate task on his first meeting with Stalin in .Moscow in August 1942. The result was' most unpleasant explosion by Stalin. The Soviet leader charged that Alolo- toy had obtained a definite promise for a second front in 1942, that failuic to carry out this promise would jeopardize Soviet military plans, and tna Churchill was opposed to such a venture from cowardice! The strategic disputes among the three Allied Powers were sharp a ,u based on very different outlooks, but in no case did cowardice play a' 1 ) role. The Soviet insistence on an immediate, all-out cross-Channel attac to relieve Nazi pressure on Russia was perfectly understandable, a though insistence on such an attack in 1942 was unrealistic. Equally u derstandable was Russia's fear that the Anglo-Americans might dive their power from Germany in order to avoid a Soviet- dominated post- . *'  . .  f the war Europe, although this fear showed no realistic appreciation or American outlook.

The British, on !e other hand, were much concerned with political issues and the way m which the postwar situation would be influenced by strategic and \"ulitary actions earlier. The Soviet leaders, to some extent, represented a Cor nbination of the two other points of view and could do so because \"ere was no such divergence between their military and political or be- u een their wartime and postwar aims. The more deeply the Anglo- meneans could be involved in the struggle with Germany, the sooner Germany could be defeated, and such a defeat, especially if it arose from a cr oss-Channel attack, would deliver all of eastern Europe into the Power of the Red armies, which would find no rivals in that area. Churchill and other British leaders could not forget the terrible cas- tles Britain had suffered in the trench warfare of 1916. They felt that lese casualties had injured Britain permanently by wiping out a whole s deration of Britain's young people, especially among the better-educated ass , and they were determined not to repeat this error in 1944. These eaders wanted a Balkan or Aegean offensive which, they believed, would, lr -h fewer casualties, leave the English-speaking Powers dominant in the ' editerranean and in the Near East, would make it possible to balance k oviet power in eastern Europe, and would cut the Soviet Union off from . e Balkans and some of central Europe. The possibility of Britain obtain- m g American consent to such an Aegean offensive was so remote that lit- effort was made to get it by direct persuasion. On the contrary, 0r ts to move toward it, step by step, were persistent. These efforts ght to postpone, or to reduce the emphasis on, the cross-Channel in- < s ion, since this would, inevitably, have compelled the end of Britain's •editerranean projects. But here, again, American insistence on the cross- annel invasion was so emphatic that the British could not challenge s directly, just as they could not advocate an Aegean invasion directly, stead, while accepting the cross-Channel invasion explicitly, the British ered, one after another, alternative projects which would postpone or i\" a ct from the cross-Channel invasion. he North African invasion was the first of these distractions, followed ¥ we Sicilian campaign, and then by the Italian invasion.

The only success Churchill had in these efforts was to persuade the Americans to engage in an amphibious attack on Italy at Anzio after the Americans had canceled plans for such an attack and had decided to choke on the Italian offensive in order to concentrate on the cross-Channel attack. In the long run Churchill had to accept the American strategic pla nS because America would provide most of the supplies and even a majority of the men for any direct attack on Europe. The American ability to compel British acquiescence in strategic decisions was a very real ele- ment in the conduct of the war. It arose from the great British need for American manpower and supplies, and it functioned through the mecha- nism of the Combined Chiefs of Staff. When Churchill came to the Arcadia Conference in Washington a the end of 1941, his chief aim was to retain the established priority 01 \"Germany first.\" He obtained this very easily on its own intrinsic merits, but at the same time he had to accept something he did not waflt-** Combined Chiefs of Staff organization to control strategy on a won wide basis. This new committee developed more power than Churchill* 0 anyone else, expected, because it had control of the supply of weapon • This power was decisive. Since no military operation could conducted without weapons or supplies, control over these gave the Com- bined Chiefs of Staff control over all operations and, thus, over the stra- tegic conduct of the war and over all local commanders. The Combine Chiefs of Staff operated through weekly meetings within the framewor of the general policy decisions made by Roosevelt and Churchill at thei periodic conferences. In this way Britain's dependence on the U nit States for its implements of war gave the United States control of B rltl strategic decisions and military operations, even in those areas (such southeast Asia or the Near East) where a British commander w nominally in charge. In the same way, the United States had indire control over much of Britain's postwar planning. In spite of the fact that the Anglo-Americans had agreed in anibig ous terms with Molotov's insistence on the need for a direct attack Hitler in Europe in 1942, it was perfectly clear that no such assault cou be made that early in the war, so the attack on North Africa was one as a substitute. In the course of the North African fighting it beca clear that the cross-Channel attack could not be mounted before spring of 1944. Accordingly, when the Germans in North Africa su rendered in .May 1943, it was necessary to open a new front against n ler quickly, since it would have been very dangerous to leave Hitler to throw most of his forces against Russia for a full year.

As Secretary of State Hull Put it in his memoirs, the atmosphere in Anglo-Russian relations became reminiscent of what it had been exactly four years earlier, just before the Nazi-Soviet Treaty of August 1939. It was at this time, apparently, that two fateful, and mutually incompatible, decisions were made on the highest levels of authority in Washington and Moscow. The decision made in Washington is one we have already mentioned— the decision to try to win Soviet cooperation in the postwar world by doing everything possible to win her trust and cooperation in the war- time period. This decision was probably based on the belief that it was n ot possible to control Russia's postwar behavior by any policy of force a gainst her during the war itself, since such an effort would benefit Hitler •without winning any enforceable agreements from Stalin. At this time, it would appear, Stalin made his decision to seek Russian security in the postwar world, not through any scheme for friendly co- deration in some idealistic international organization, as Roosevelt n °ped, but by setting up, on the Soviet Union's western frontiers, a buf- er area of satellite states under governments friendly to Moscow. Such governments, probably in Communist control, would replace the Cordon s «nitaire which the Western Pow ers had created to isolate Russia fol- ding the First World War, with what might be called a Cordon Msanitmre\" which could serve to isolate the Soviet Union from the out- Sl de world following World War II. Washington was informed of this Possibility by the American ambassador in Moscow on April 28, 1943, u t paid little attention to the warning, probably because of the near- topossibility of finding any alternative policy toward the Soviet Union. in spite of Soviet scorn, the military operations in Africa and the Mediterranean W ere major efforts for the inexperienced forces of unmili- atized nations, although they obviously could not compare to the Nazi- oviet deathlock involving hundreds of divisions on the plains and in the °rests of eastern Europe. The victory in North Africa was completed May 1943. Two months later came the invasion of Sicily. The attack n this strategic island was the greatest landing-assault of the war, eight 'Visions coming ashore simultaneously side by side. The island is almost tight-angle triangle, with its right angle in the extreme northeast, sepa- at ed from the Italian mainland by the Strait of Messina, only three miles iue.

Once ashore, however, the campaign was ineptly carried on because occupation of territory was given precedence over destruction of enemy forces: Pat- ton drove northwestward to seize Palermo (July 22nd), and then fol- lowed the enemy forces eastward to Messina along the northern coast; Montgomery, moving slowly northward parallel to the eastern coast, made a detour to the west of Mount Etna. No efforts were made to close the Straits of Messina; as a result, the Germans were able to send almost two divisions as reinforcements from Italy and, later, when the island had to be abandoned, they were equally free to evacuate it, carrying almost 40,000 troops with 9,650 vehicles and 17,000 tons of stores over the Straits of Messina to Italy in seven days without loss of a man. At the same time, in a separate operation, 62,000 Italian troops also escaped to the mainland. By August 17th Sicily had been conquered, but the evacuated enemy forces were reorganizing to defend Italy itself. The Italians had no taste for the defense of Italy. They had been dragged into the war by Mussolini's action and against their own desires, in June 1940, and by 1943 thev were heartily sick of the whole thing- This discontent was fully developed long before the attack on Sicily ' n June. In February the Duce had dismissed Count Ciano, his son-in-law, and Count Dino Grandi from their posts as ministers of foreign affairs and of justice because of their defeatism and opposition. But these qua'\" ties continued to spread, even in the innermost circles of the govern- ment. The invasion of Sicily gave the final spurt to this development. t> July 24th the Fascist Grand Council passed a motion calling for t restoration of the constitutional functions of all agencies of the goveri - ment and the restoration to the king of full command of the arm forces. This motion, carried 18-8, was essentially a vote of no-confident^ in Mussolini. The following morning the king demanded the Due resignation and, as he was leaving the palace, had him arrested.

The history of Italy in 1943 is a history of lost opportunities, perhaps necessarily lost, bur, nevertheless, a disappointment to evervone con- c 'erned. If events had turned out favorablv, Italy might have got out of the war in the summer of that year and the Germans might have been ejected from the peninsula shortly afterward. Instead, Italy was torn to P'eces; its peoples and the invading Allied troops suffered great hardships; and the country got out of the war so slowly that Germans were still hghting on Italian soil at the final surrender in 1945. These general misfortunes of Italy were the result of a number of torces working together. One was the military weakness of Italy in respect to Germany; this made it impossible for Italy to end the war, °r even to surrender to the Allies, because any effort to do so would e ad to an immediate German seizure of the whole country and of its e aders, the exploitation and devastation of the one and the massacre °t the others. Italy was far too weak to hold the Germans back long enough to permit an Allied occupation of Italy. A second factor was the Weakness of the Allies because of the diversion of their power to Britain ln preparation for Overlord: this meant that the Allies lacked the strength to move quickly into Italy to protect it from complete German °ccupacion, even if Italy could surrender secretly to the Allies and cooperate with their entrance. A third factor was the complete mistrust °t the Italians both by the Germans and by the Allies. This mistrust, for which the political conduct of the Italians, both foreign and domestic, over at least two generations, was responsible, provided the key to the Whole situation. The only way in which the fighting in Italy could ave been ended quickly would have been for Italy to surrender secretly 0 the Allies and cooperate with them in an immediate large-scale inva- S1 °n of northern Italy, but the Allies were too distrustful of the Italians 0 cooperate with them in a project such as this or even to accept a secret surrender. And, finally, a fourth obstacle was the wooden and flexible Allied insistence on unconditional surrender which, meaning- ess as it might have been, nevertheless made it impossible for the Bado- S 'o government either to cooperate with the Allies as co-belligerents gainst the Germans (as it wished to do) or to keep the surrender secret om the Germans long enough to forestall their violent reactions. Not n «y did unconditional surrender exclude both co-belligerency and ccrecv; it also left the Italians helpless to resist the Germans. Above all, 1e se four factors made it impossible to prevent a German seizure of 0111c, which was, in some ways, the center of the whole problem.

When the Badoglio government made contact with the Allies through Madrid on August 16th and offered to join them in fighting Germany, all it could ohtain was a demand for unconditional surrender. After days of discussion, an armistice accepting the Allied terms was signed on September 3rd, with the understanding that it would be kept secret until the Allies had troops ready to land in force on the mainland. Three days later, the Italian government discovered that the Allied landing operation, already in progress, was only a small force and was heade for Salerno, south of Naples, where it would be no help to the Italians in resisting any German efforts to take over most of Italy. They in- sisted that the publication of the armistice and a tentative Allied para- trooper \"drop\" in Rome must be put off until sufficient Allied forces were within striking distance of Rome to protect the city from m e German troops near it. Eisenhower refused, and published the Italian surrender on September 8th, one day before the American Seventh Army landed at Salerno. The Germans reacted to the news of the Italian \"betrayal\" and of the Allied invasion of southern Italv with characteristic speed. While the available forces in central Italy converged on the Salerno beachhead, an armored division fought its way into Rome, Italian troops were disarme or intimidated everywhere, and the Badoglio government, with King Victor Emmanuel, had to flee to the British-controlled area aroun Brindisi. Much of the Italian fleet escaped to Allied control in the Mediterranean, but numerous vessels were sunk by the Germans or wer scuttled to escape falling into their hands. In most of Italy, there wa political paralysis and confusion; at some places Italians fought one an- other, or simply murdered one another, while opinion ranged the who gamut from complete indifference on one extreme to violent fanaticism on the other. In order to have some legal excuse for controlling Italy, the German sent parachutists to rescue Mussolini from his \"prison\" in a summe hotel in the mountains of the Gran Sasso, escaping with him by air northern Italy where he was presented with a German-picked govern- ment of \"neo-Fascists\" under the name Italian Social Republic (Septem- ber 13-15, 1943). Broken and weary, the ex-Duce of Fascism became pliant tool of German ruthlessness and of the corrupt and criminal ne Fascists who surrounded him. In this group the most influential we the family of Mussolini's mistress, Clara Petacci, which Count Cian called \"that circle of prostitutes and white slavers which for some yea have plagued Italian political life.\" In Allied hands, the king and Badoglio were forced, on September *9< 1943, to sign another, much longer, armistice; by its provisions Italian Government were bound hand and foot, and made complete J"},{"pageNumber":780,"pageContent":"WORLD WAR II: EBB OF AGGRESSION, IQ4I-IQ45 765 subject to the will of the Allied Governments as expressed through the Allied Commander-in-Chief.\" In conformity to this will, on October 1 3 t h the king's government declared war against Germany. As the Allied forces slowly recovered Italian territory from the tena- cious grasp of the Germans, the roval government remained subservient to its conquerors. Civilian affairs immediately behind the advancing battle lines were completely in military hands under an organization known as Allied Military Government of Occupied Territory, or AM- COT; farther back, civilian affairs were under an Allied Control Commission. The creation of these organizations, on a purely Anglo- American basis, to rule the first Axis territory to be \"liberated\" became a Ve ry important precedent for Soviet behavior when their armies began to occupy enemy territory in eastern Europe: The Russians were able to argue that thev could exclude the Anglo-Americans from active participation in military government in the east since they had earlier °een excluded from such participation in the west. While these political events were taking place, the military advance Was moving like a snail. The Allied invasion of Italy, at American insist- ence, w as given very limited resources for a very large task. This unutation of resources in Italy sought to prevent the British from using t he Italian campaign as an excuse for delaying or postponing the cross- channel attack on Europe scheduled for the spring of 1944. It was only u nder such limitations of resources, explicitly stated, that the Americans °- accepted the British suggestion for any invasion of mainland Italy at all. I n ]yj a y 1043, at a plenary meeting in Washington, the Combined ^niefs of Staff had set May 1944 as target date for a cross-Channel Evasion of Europe with 29 divisions, had ordered a full-scale aerial offensive on Germany with 2,700 heavy and 800 medium bombers, had S lv en the American Joint Chiefs of Staff complete control over the acinc war against Japan, and had asked General Eisenhower to draw U P plans for an invasion of Italy using no forces beyond what he had n hand. This last limitation was repeated on July 26th when the general Was ordered to carry out his plans. *he invasion of Italy was a two-pronged effort. On September 3rd u . r ^ sri divisions under General Montgomery crossed the Straits of essina and began to moye northward against little opposition. Six days er a British airborne division from Bizerte was landed at Taranto and ^gan to move up the Adriatic coast. On the same day, September 9th, e **ifth Army of two American and two British divisions under Lieu- e nant General Mark W. Clark landed at Salerno. The landing site was . tne n ^xt bay south of the famous Bay of Naples, and separated from V the rugged Sorrento Peninsula.

Within three days, six German divisions, four of them motorized, were around the Salerno beachhead, with six hundred tanks. In fierce fighting, the area was slowly expanded, although at one point the German counterattacks almost broke through to the beach. Naval gunfire against the German tanks was the decisive factor in a seesaw struggle. On September 13 th the American 82 nd Airborne Division w as dropped behind the beachhead. About the same time, Rommel, W command in northern Italy, refused to release reinforcements to Kessel- ring in the south. On September 16th the latter commander authorized a withdrawal from the area in order to get beyond the range of n ava gunfire. On the same day, Montgomery's Eighth Army made contact with Clark's Fifth Army, and an Allied line was stretched across Italy to the Adriatic. This line moved slowly northward, capturing Nap es on the first day of October 1943. The city was a shambles, filled wit wreckage and heavilv boobv-trapped; the water supply had been delib- erately polluted, and all food stores and government records had been destroyed; the harbor area, completely in flames, was filled with sunkei ships, locomotives, and other large objects to make it unusable. I' 11 wa$ the kind of situation where American energy, humanitarianism, alK ingenuity excelled; sanitation and order were restored at once, f° ot was provided for the hungrv Italians, and the harbor was cleaned up s< successfully that it was handling tonnage beyond its prewar rated t a \" pacitv within three months. By October 7th the Allied advance had been stopped on the Voltum\" River line twenty miles north of Naples. Two months later, when <-« eI eral Eisenhower was transferred to take over the Supreme Commas for the approaching invasion of western Europe, the Allied lines n moved northward no farther than the German Gustav Line. This \" n eighty miles south of Rome and following, roughly, the Rapido Kiv in the west and the lower Garigliano in the east, took every advantag of the rugged terrain, and allowed the enemy to inflict heavy casual 1 on the attackers, especially by artillery fire from the greatly f ea German 88-mm. euns. To outflank this position, an amphibious law' t> was ordered bevond the German rear at Anzio, just north of the Foi Marshes, thirty miles south of Rome. Originally the landing was to ha v been made in one operation, leaving the Allied forces on a beach « supplies for eight days and no provision for any reinforcements or plenishment from the sea. This was based on the expectation that main Allied forces would come up from the south in time to re 1 the new beachhead. When it became clear that the Allied forces c not advance up the peninsula, the plan was canceled on December -- Three davs later, at a hurriedly summoned conference at Tunis, Cnu ill was able to have the plan reinstated, offering a British division to g with the single American division originally planned."},{"pageNumber":782,"pageContent":"WORLD WAR II: EBB OF AGGRESSION, I 94 I - I 945 767 On January 20, 1944, General Clark tried to cross the flooded Rapido River at the foot of the great hill on which stood the ancient Benedic- \"ne Monaster) 7 of Monte Cassino. His aim was to advance northward toward Anzio. After two days of bloody fighting, the crossing had to he abandoned; that same day (January 22nd) the two Allied divisions landed at Anzio, hoping to cut the German communications going southward toward Monte Cassino. The landing was easy, but within a w 'eek Marsha] Kesselring was able to shift sufficient forces from the subsiding Rapido front to seal off the Anzio beachhead. Although the Allies committed four more divisions to the Anzio operation, giving six m all, they could not break out of the German vise. The result was a st alemate in which the Germans could hold both the Rapido line and the Anzio line bv shifting forces rapidly from one to the other as seemed necessary. As is usual in a stalemate, there was much of criticism of these opera- tions, especially from the Allied side. It was suggested that the German success in holding the Rapido was due to the accuracy of their artillery nr e and that this was being spotted from the ancient monastery (founded °. v St. Benedict in A.D. 529) on the top of Monte Cassino. It was further suggested that General Clark should have obliterated the monastery with aerial bombardment but had failed to do so because he was a Catholic. After February 15, 1944, General Clark did destroy the site completely ) )' Air Force bombs without helping the situation a bit. We now know n at the Germans had not been using the monastery; but, once it was estroyed by us, they dug into the rubble to make a stronger defense. The stalemate on the Gustav Line was broken in the latter half of M ia y 1944. By that time French, Polish, and Italian units were fighting ° n the Allied side, giving twenty-seven Allied divisions against twenty German. On May 16th a French corps crossed the Garigliano River, and three days later, after terrible casualties, a Polish division captured 1 lonte Cassino. Kesselring sullenly withdrew northward, followed by he Allied forces. The latter were greeted with hysterical enthusiasm >* the liberated Italians. On May 25th contact was made with the Anzio orces, and, on June 4, 1944, the American 88th Division, an all-selective- service unit, entered Rome. As the liberating forces came in and the Germans hurriedly withdrew, onie was little short of a madhouse. Hundreds of prisoners held by the crnians and neo-Fascist secret police were murdered in their cells, and e 'pless civilians were murdered as hostages or in reprisal by the re- lating German forces. Guerrilla bands behind the German lines per- orrned good services to the Allied cause, harassing communications, •ssisting Allied intelligence, and helping escaping prisoners. Many of lese guerrillas were fighting for social revolution as well as for the 'Deration of Italy, and there was a good deal of rivalry and even of lQ ient conflict among them. The dominant influence was that of the"},{"pageNumber":783,"pageContent":"768  TRAGEDY AND HOPE Communists, who were more highly disciplined and more closely con- trolled than the non-Communist units. The fall of Mussolini gave a considerable impetus to postwar planning within the Allied camps. There had been a certain amount of this during the dark days from 1939 to 1943, but on the whole the Allied leaders were reluctant to commit themselves to any projects which might re- strict their freedom of action in conducting the war or in manipulating its diplomatic and propagandist background. The collapse of one of the enemy states, however, made it necessary to devote some serious at- tention to postwar plans. At the same time, experiences in Italy showed that the problems of the postwar era would be much broader than merely political or diplomatic, and would include social, economic, and ideological problems on a scale never experienced previously. It xvaS clear that the poverty, confusion, and human suffering found by our advancing armies in Italy would be increased tenfold when the much more bitter resistance of Germany had been overcome. In order to avoid any repetition of the widespread Allied \"deals\" with Darlan and other \"Vichykes,\" the occupied areas of Italy were subjected to a completely military Allied government, although, to obtain leg 3 continuity and legal justification for this government, the various agree- ments were signed bv Badoglio. Even this small amount of contact wit ex-Fascist leaders aroused adverse comment in certain circles in the United States, although at the same time and, usually, in the same circles, there was objection to the use of a purely military administration as a alternative. The only other possibility 7 would have been to turn tn newly liberated areas over to the local anti-Fascist native groups. I hi last solution was out of the question, for these groups were general ) so determined on social and economic revolution that they would ha created conflicts and disturbances which would have jeopardized t position of our armies of occupation and would certainly have increase the social and economic problems which most Americans were eager reduce. These social and economic problems were mostly of a ve y practical nature and were concerned with starvation, disease, pd D order, and the care of displaced persons. All these problems were drastically increased by the ruthless destru tiveness of the German forces as they withdrew toward Germany itse • Food supplies were taken away or were destroyed; millions were homeless, many of them far from their homes and in pitiful conditio of semistarvation and disease. These conditions, which became stead ) w r orse as the war drew to its close, made a great appeal to the huffla tarian feelings of Americans, and presented problems with which An 1 ican generosity and organizational efficiency were well able to deal. the other hand, Americans had weak political interests and narro ideological training and were eager to avoid problems such as forms"},{"pageNumber":784,"pageContent":"WORLD WAR II: EBB OF AGGRESSION, 1941-1945 769 government, patterns of property distribution, or nationalistic disputes. 1C is, then, not surprising that American postwar planning and the be- havior of American administrators neglected the latter kinds of prob- lems to devote their energies to the more practical tasks of material survival. On the political, legal, or ideological problems the American liberators\" had little to offer beyond rather vague and idealistic praise °f democracy, private ownership, and freedom. While the military efforts of the Anglo-Americans were, in full public view, passing from victory to victory in the early months of J 943i a very ominous situation had arisen behind the scenes in respect to their relations with the Soviet Union. We have already mentioned the evidence that quite incompatible decisions about the postwar world had been made in Washington and Moscow at this time. The decision m Washington seems to have been that every effort would be made, through wartime concessions to the Soviet Union, to obtain Russian cooperation in a postwar international organization and that all territorial problems should be left to the postwar period. The decision in Moscow seems to have been that the Anglo-American Powers could not be trusted and that the Soviet Union must seek to ensure its postwar security by creation of a series of satellite and buffer states on its western frontier. * he incompatibility of these points of view gave rise to the Polish crisis of May i 943 . After the Nazi-Soviet division of Poland in September 1939, a Polish government-in-exile was established in France and later in London, with General Wladyslaw Sikorski as prime minister. This government, al- though recognized as the successor to the defeated Polish government \"y most of the world, was not recognized by the Axis Powers or by the Soviet Union. These pretended that Poland had ceased to exist. Russia, which had received half of Poland, with 13.2 million of Poland's 35 million inhabitants, incorporated these areas into the Soviet Union, miposing Soviet citizenship on the inhabitants, and forced over a million °f them to go to other parts of Russia to work in mines, in factories, or 011 farms. Most educated or professional persons among the Poles were arrested and put into concentration camps with the captured officers of me Polish armies. In the meantime the portions of Poland taken by Germany had been divided into two parts, of which the western (with l0 -5 million inhabitants) was incorporated into Germany, and the rest (With 11.5 million inhabitants, and including Warsaw) was organized as the government-general of Poland under German administration. The •Nazis sought to force all ethnic Poles into the government-general; to ^terminate, either directly or through the exhaustion and malnutrition °f slave labor, all the educated elements among the Polish people; and to murder without compunction the country's large Jewish population. The German attack on the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941 led to a"},{"pageNumber":785,"pageContent":"77»  TRAGEDY AND HOPE brief reversal of the Kremlin's attitude toward Poland. In an apparent effort to obtain Polish support in the struggle with Germany, the Soviet Union reestablished diplomatic relations with the Polish government-in- exile in London, and signed an agreement on July 30, 1941 by which the Soviet-German partition treaties of 1939 were canceled, a general am- nesty was granted Polish citizens imprisoned in the Soviet Union, and General Wladvslaw Anders was allowed to organize a new Polish army from the Poles in the Soviet Union. Efforts to create this army were hampered bv the fact that about 10,000 Polish officers along with about 5,000 Polish intellectuals and professional persons, all of whom had been held in three camps in western Russia, could not be found. In addition at least 100,000 Polish prisoners of war, out of the 230,000 captured by Soviet forces in September 1939, had been exterminated in Soviet labor camps from starvation and overwork, and over a mill' 011 Polish civilians were being similarly treated. Constant obstacles were offered by the Soviet authorities to the efforts of General Anders to reconstruct a Polish army in the east. When rations were cut to 26,000 to feed a force of 70,000 soldiers and many thousands of Polish civilian refugees, Anders obtained permission t evacuate his force to Iran (March 1942). It was this group which fought so well the following years in Italy and in western Europe. As soon as Anders's forces left Russia, the Soviet leaders began to organize a group of Polish and Russian Communists into a so-calle Union of Polish Patriots which sponsored a Polish-language radio station and a new Communist-controlled Polish army in Russia. In January 1943, Moscow informed the Sikorski government in London that a Poles originating from the provinces occupied by Soviet forces 1 September 1939 would be regarded as Soviet subjects. While Soviet-Polish relations were deteriorating, the German radio suddenly announced, on April 13, 1943, that German forces in occupie Russia had discovered, at Katyn near Smolensk, Russia, mass gr ave containing the bodies of 5,000 Polish officers who had been murdere by the Soviet authorities in the spring of 1940. Moscow called this Nazi propaganda trick and declared that the Polish officers had been murdered and buried bv the Nazis themselves when they captured tn officers and the locality by overrunning this Soviet territory and 1 • concentration camps in August 1941. When the Polish government 1 London requested an investigation of this crime at the site by the Inte - national Red Cross, the Soviet government broke off diplomatic relation with the Sikorski government on the grounds that it had fallen victim Nazi propaganda because of anti-Soviet feeling.

This evidence, which clearly indicates Soviet guilt, includes the following points: (1) the ^'ctirns were wearing the uniforms and boots issued to them at the out- )r cak of war in 1939, and these were in good condition, showing a mini- muni of wear as might be the case in April 1940, but could not have )c cn true in August 1941; (;) all letters, journals, or documents on the )0 dies had dates previous, to Mav 1940, and in no case later; (3) the Vlc tims were arranged in the graves in groups in the same order in which Mtey had been removed from the Soviet concentration camp at Kozielski In March and April 1940; (4) the victims wrote letters to their families at home up to April 1940, but not later; (5) letters to victims from their amilies were delivered by Soviet authorities up to April 1940, but were returned to the senders as undeliverable after that date; (6) in private conversations various Soviet authorities at various times admitted the murders. There is much other evidence showing Soviet guilt in this a nair, but it must not be forgotten that both Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany were determined to exterminate all Polish leaders and the Polish nation bv reducing the leaderless Poles to the status of slave 1 1  *  ©  J at>orers and that Germany also would have killed these Polish officers if l1e y had captured them, since the Germans did exterminate 4,000,000 roles in this way during the war. Although the number of bodies at •vatyn was less than 5,000, the number of officers murdered was almost twice this figure, the rest, apparently, having been drowned in the White Sea. The crisis in Soviet-Polish relations in the spring of 1943 marks a turning point in the relations of the three Great Powers fighting Ger- many, although every effort was made to conceal this fact at that time. rorr > March 1943 onward, the Soviet authorities did all they could to D mld up the Union of Polish Patriots as the center of aspirations of the Poles still suffering in their own country, while, at the same time, Washington began to pay the Polish government-in-exile an annual sub- .V of Si2.5 million to finance its underground organizations in Poland and its diplomatic relations with Latin-American countries. Within oland itself, the London government soon had a secret army and a se cret underground government, including a parliament, schools, and a system of courts. This government met in secret, made decisions, and executed sentences on disloyal Poles, especially on collaborators with the Nazis.  •  F  Nazi plans aimed at the eventual extermination of the Poles and the olish nation. In the winter of 1939-1940, all Poles were deported, street \\V street with only a few hours' notice, from the western areas annexed 0 Germany into the government-general. In the latter areas, under rll c rule of Hans Frank and Arthur Scvss-Inquart, all wealth which could"},{"pageNumber":787,"pageContent":"77 2  TRAGEDY AND HOPE be used by Germany was confiscated and removed; all Polish institutions of higher learning or culture were abolished, so that only elementary schools (and these conducted in the German language) were allowed; all outstanding persons were murdered; millions were deported west- ward to work as slave laborers in German factories; the food con- sumption of those who remained was reduced by German seizure of food supplies to a quarter of the daily need (to 600 calories); and various measures, such as separation of the sexes, were taken to prevent the reproduction of Poles. Under these circumstances it is remarkable that Polish spirit could not be broken, that hundreds of thousands of Poles continued to resist in guerrilla bands, in the underground \"Home Army\" under Generals \"Grot\" (Stefan Rowecki) and \"Bor\" (Thaddeus Ko- morowski), and that sabotage, propaganda, spying, and communication with the Polish government in London continued to flourish. At the time these events were taking place, the people of the English- speaking world were almost totally ignorant of the diplomatic contro- versies behind the scenes and almost equally ignorant of the conditions of hfe in German-occupied Europe. On the other hand, they were full)' aware of the victory in North Africa, of the conquest of Sicily, and of the invasion of Italy. The strategic decisions involved in these campaigns and, above all, the decision of September 1943 to reject Churchill's plans for a Balkan campaign in order to concentrate on the cross-Channel offensive for 1944, were of vital importance in setting the form that postwar Europe would take. If the strategic decision of 1943 had been made differently, to postpone the cross-Channel attack and, instead, to concentrate on an assault from the Aegean across Bulgaria and Romania toward Poland and Slovakia, the postwar situation would have been quite different. This we can say with assurance even though we cannot say with any certainty what the difference would have been. In the course of 1943, while Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin were still devoting their chief attention to the conduct of the war, their foreign ministers, Cordell Hull, Anthony Eden, and Vyachislav Molo- tov, were giving increasing attention to planning for postwar problems- The chief of these problems which were discussed were: (1) the eco- nomic demobilization of the victor Powers, (2) the relief and rehabili- tation of the defeated countries and of the liberated areas, (3) problems involving refugees and displaced persons, (4) problems of finance and of international monetary exchanges, (5) the punishment of \"war crimi- nals\" in the defeated states, (6) the forms of government of these states and of the liberated states, (7) territorial questions such as the boundaries of Germany, of Hungary, or of Poland, (8) the disposition of the colonial possessions, or, as they were called, the \"dependent areas,\" of both vic- tors and vanquished, (9) the problem of the postwar political relation- ships of the victorious states and of the world as a whole."},{"pageNumber":788,"pageContent":"WORLD WAR II: EBB OF AGGRESSION, I94.I-IQ45 773 It is evident that many of these problems were of an explosive nature and could lead to disputes among the Allies and possibly even to a Weakening of their joint anti-German efforts. As a consequence, the foreign ministers' discussions of manv of these problems were tentative and hesitant and were frequendv interrupted to confer with the three neads of governments. Even on this higher level, agreement could not be re ached in some cases, and these problems were generally put aside lest efforts to reach an agreement alienate the Allies to the detriment of their ar efforts against Germany. This was most emphatically true of ques- jons involving the possible postwar situation in eastern Europe where e frontiers of Germany, of Poland, and of the Soviet Union or the atus of Poland and of the Baltic states were far too controversial to e raised except in a most tentative way. It has frequentlv been argued in recent vears that failure to reach >' agreement on the territorial and governmental settlement of eastern Uro pe while the war was still in progress meant that these questions 'ould tend to be settled by the military situation in existence at the end the war with little consideration for questions of legalitv, humanity, e edom, nationalism, the rights of small states, or other factors which ere mentioned so frequentlv in the Allied wartime propaganda.

These arguments usually assume that the Soviet Union was ctant to make an early agreement on this subject and that it could been forced to do so because of its need for American supplies E the fighting. This assumption implies that America should have So r - atenec * t0 reduce or to cut off Lend-Lease supplies going to the Ct n ' on unless we could obtain Soviet agreement to the kind of p /\" European settlement we wanted.

Moreover, the Anglo-American leaders were fearful that, if Russia's ability to fight Germany was reduced by any curtailing of supplies, the Soviet leader might make a separate peace with Hitler, allowing the Nazis to turn tne full brunt of their fury westward. Rumors of possible Soviet-Nazi dis- cussions looking toward a separate peace were circulating in Londo and Washington at various times, particularly in the latter part of 1943' and the Anglo-American leaders were too clearly aware of the sudae Nazi-Soviet agreement of August 1939 to push the Russians so ha that they might make another, more fateful, agreement of a sinn character.

Winston Churchill, in June 194 1 ' ' gainst Hitler with the statement that readV to welcomed the Russians as allies against Hitler with the statement tha would be ready to allv with the devil in hell if the devil was fight Hitler. Naturally, this point of view became less extreme as defeat of Hitler became less remote, but the Germans fought so y ' up to the very end of the war, that it never became possible to anv Soviet concessions in regard to the postwar political settleme eastern Europe. Instead, the tactic was adopted, wholeheartedly by ident Roosevelt, more reluctantly by Prime Minister Churchill, of tr) to win the Soviet leaders, especially Stalin, to a less suspicious and n conciliatory mood bv full-scale cooperation in the war and by f ne concessions to Soviet sensibilities on wider issues. This alternative p was by no means an easy one, for Soviet suspicions were so clos y the surface and Soviet sensibilities were so touchy that cooperation these people proved to be a very delicate and unpleasant business, however, a business at which Roosevelt was personally adept, ai ^ worked, adequately enough, until the war with Germany and Roosev life drew to their close together in the spring of 1945.  ^  The various postwar problems we have mentioned were disc ^ at a series of high-level conferences during the war years.

Roosevelt felt that n .V the four Great Powers would need to be armed in the postwar or 'd and could keep the peace for all other states if they could agree among themselves. Other states, relieved of the burden of armaments, u u devote all their resources to economic reconstruction. The four reat Powers would be helped in the task of keeping the peace for all 7 their joint possession of various strategic points throughout the * lc >, like Dakar or Formosa, and could work together to instruct the \" llc opinion of the world by a joint sponsorship of informational enters scattered about the globe. In such a svstem, in which lesser states , n0t to defend themselves, there could be no objection, in Roose- s thinking, to separating peoples, like the Serbs and Croats, who d not agree, or in providing independence for dependent areas, such Hong Kong, Most of this made little sense to Eden, who was not r cpared to give up Hong Kong or other portions of the British colonial P ^sessions or to see the Soviet Union on the borders of a Europe in lc h all other states were disarmed. The chief areas of agreement at ls conference were that Germany should be dismembered after the w ar and that Poland could obtain East Prussia. wo months later, at the so-called \"Trident\" Conference in Washing- > Churchill and Roosevelt went over the same matters (May 1943). e , Cr °ss-Channel attack, Overlord, was set for May 1944, and an in- • Slfl ed aerial bombardment of Germany ordered as a preliminary. No Portant decisions could be made on postwar problems, although the s P' le re was brightened by a Soviet announcement of the abolition t \"e Communist International and an Anglo-American announcement Enouncing extraterritorial rights in China. /he next conference, held in May and June 1943 at Hot Springs, ginia, was of a technical nature, and discussed postwar food and 8 'cultural problems. From this conference there emerged a United ions Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), an advisory body collect and disseminate agricultural information, as had been done r eviously by the League of Nations affiliate, the International Institute Agriculture in Rome. Uosely related to FAO, but of a temporary rather than permanent •tacter and possessing administrative rather than simply advisory (T\\ erS ' Was t ' ie United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration 'NRRA).

Herbert Lehman, former governor e w York, was elected director-general of the new organization. n the meantime, in August 1943 at Quebec, in what is sometimes"},{"pageNumber":791,"pageContent":"776  TRAGEDY AND HOPE called the \"Quadrant\" Conference, Churchill and Roosevelt found some time for discussion of postwar policy, although their chief concern was with Italy, with Overlord, and with a new supplement to Overlord con- sisting of an invasion of southern France from the Mediterranean -> e and up the Rhone Valley. This new invasion, known as Anvil, was to launched in the summer of 1944. At Quebec, Churchill accepted Roosevelt's postwar projects wi considerable reluctance. The prime minister felt strongly that the Uni States and the Soviet Union would be the two giants of the postw world and that Britain's best interests lay in building some kind of o nu sphere of influence in Europe and in Asia as a balance against these t\\ giants. He wished to see two regional associations for these two arc ' with Britain in both, the two forming part, if necessary, of some larger, worldwide association. It soon became clear that the United States *° accept no regional associations of this character, and insisted on a wor wide association of individual countries. The American insistence on spheres of influence and no settlement of frontiers while the war was . like the American insistence that China was a Great Power, was garded by the other two Allies as childishly unrealistic and even n)r ocritical, especially as both Britain and Russia were convinced that United States was aiming to create American spheres of interest, \" regional associations, in its areas of chief concern, Latin America < the Far East. Churchill had to accept Roosevelt's projects for a postwar i° national organization for fear that resistance to these might lead revival of American isolationism following the Second World War, had happened after 1919. This, above all, Churchill had to prevent, s it would leave Britain facing the Soviet Union with no Great r° companionship. Accordingly, at Quebec in August 1943, Churchil cepted Hull's draft for a postwar United Nations Organization, c sisting of four Great Powers and associated lesser Powers ° worldwide basis. This meant that Britain was committed to seek supp against the Soviet Union from the United States within the U Nations organization rather than through some tripartite balanc power system with spheres of influence. One important consequence of this British commitment to the An ican point of view appeared in 1943 with respect to the explosive pr° of the Polish frontiers. Britain and Russia reached a tentative agree ^ to move the whole Polish state westward by wholesale transre population, drawing its eastern boundary along the Curzon L in compensating for this loss of territory in the east by moving its w boundary to the Oder and Neisse rivers. Churchill sincerely f el . this shift would greatly strengthen Poland, since the areas lost 1 east to Russia were largely swamps and pine barrens, while the"},{"pageNumber":792,"pageContent":"WORLD WAR II: EBB OF AGGRESSION, 194I-1945 777 0 be acquired from Germany in the west were rich in agricultural and Mineral resources. This project had to be abandoned, however, when it u 'as rejected by both the United States and Poland. The only agreement ich could be reached was an informal one that Poland should obtain East Prussia. /n P re P arat i° n for the forthcoming first meeting of the Big Three (Koosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin) in Teheran, their foreign ministers le t in Moscow in October 1943. Russian suggestions to force Turkey the war or to demand air bases in Sweden were rejected, and it was generally agreed not to dismember Germany after the war but to force e imans to pay reparations for damages and to undergo punishment for Crimes against humanity or international law. It was agreed that a dis- armed Germany should be ruled jointly under an Inter-Allied Commis- °n and that Austria should be reestablished as an independent country. A he chief achievement of the conference was the signature of a Four- ation Declaration on the United Nations. This document stated that e signers would continue to cooperate after the war \"for the organ- ation and maintenance of peace and security.\" It further promised to e ate \"a general international organization based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all peace-loving states and open to membership by such states.\" The four Powers also promised not to use their armies t he postwar period in the territories of other states \"except for the P r poses envisaged in this declaration and after joint consultation\" and cooperate together to regulate postwar armaments. This declaration as significant because of the American promise not to relapse into ation again and because of the American success in having China ac cepted, admittedly with reluctance, as a Great Power. n re porting to a joint session of Congress on the significance of this Element, Secretary of State Hull voiced that kind of naive idealism * llcn made Churchill squirm. He said, \"As the provisions of the Four- ation Declaration are carried into effect, there will no longer be need r spheres of influence, for alliances, for balancing of power, or any er kind of special arrangements through which, in the unhappy past, e nations strove to safeguard their security or to promote their in- terests.\" He went on to point out, as a desirable fact, that questions of oundarics had been left in abeyance until the end of hostilities, as the Uni ted States had desired. Just at this time considerable efforts were being made in the United . ates t0 obtain popular commitments against any postwar return to jatiorusm. On September 7, 1943, a conference of leaders of the Re- F >lican Party at Mackinac Island, Michigan, endorsed the hopes for a i' stwar international organization. Two weeks later, the Fulbright solution favoring such an organization passed the House of Represen-"},{"pageNumber":793,"pageContent":"778  TRAGEDY AND HOPE tatives by a vote of 360 to 29, and in November a similar expression, the Connaliv Resolution, was accepted in the United States Senate by a v° K of 85 to 5. The Moscow Conference of Foreign .Ministers was followed, with 1 \" a month, bv the first meeting of the Big Three, held at Teheran from -     -ith     November 28 to December 1, 1943. Since Russia was not at war WJ Japan, there were no Chinese representatives at Teheran, and the Ang'°\" Americans met with these at two separate conferences in Cairo heror and after the sessions in Teheran (November 22-26 and December y j 1943). Although the war against China was being fought quite ino e pendently from the war against Germanv, the Cairo discussions forme a background for the Teheran negotiations, and undoubtedly influenc them. Once again, this influence was exerted through strategic disco sions. Originally, American strategy against Japan had, under General ma Arthur's influence, given a major role to the armv with supporting ro for the navv and air force. This earlier strategy had taken a i° r known as \"island-hopping\" and had envisaged a major role for China a the Chinese Army. This strategy intended to approach Japan from Au tralia, island by island, landing on each and wiping out the Japanese g risons on each before going on to the next. Eventually this method v'° have brought the American Armv into contact with China, both acr Burma into the southwestern provinces and also along the southeas coast at the traditional points of entry to China, at Hong Kong an Canton. Once contact with China had been made in this way, the assault on Japan would be made by using Chinese forces and Crii bases as major elements in this final assault. Just as the Teheran Conference was meeting, this Far East strategy being modified as a result of three factors. In the first place, the so of the United States Navy with carrier-based planes and with amphi n landing operations was showing that an attack on Japan could be 1 directly from the open Pacific without any need to recapture man Japan's island bases beyond those which were needed as bases for own air-force attacks on Japan and that this could be done wi any preliminary contact with the Chinese mainland. At the same •     f Chiang it was becoming increasingly clear that the Chinese regime or Kai-shek was hopelessly corrupt and noncombative and could cont little or nothing to the final assault on Japan's home islands or even • 1 -l It ^\" elimination of the large Japanese forces on the Asfastic mainland. just at this moment that Stalin indicated his willingness to interv the war on Japan and to provide Soviet forces for the elimination Japanese troops in Asia as soon as the war with Germany was n ^ As American faith in China's ability to overcome the Japanese tor the Asiastic mainland steadily dwindled and their faith in America"},{"pageNumber":794,"pageContent":"WORLD WAR II: EBB OF AGGRESSION, 194I-I945 779 !vy to strike a fatal blow at Japan itself from the open Pacific grew, it became increasingly a part of America's aims to obtain a Soviet commit- ment to enter the war against Japan in order to overcome the Japanese troops in Asia. This desire, forced on Roosevelt by his military leaders, greatly weakened the President in his negotiations with Stalin, since ft Roosevelt could not be adamant on Russia's position in eastern Europe, 01 even in eastern Asia, if lie was seeking to obtain a Soviet commitment t0 go to war with Japan. At Teheran, Stalin was chiefly motivated by an intense fear of Ger- many and a desire to strengthen the Soviet Union along its western >order as protection against Germany. Apparentlv, this fear was so great la t Stalin did not want Germany to go Communist after the war, pos- S1 >' from fear that such a change would strengthen it. Instead, he de- manded, and obtained, Polish frontiers on the Curzon Line and the Oder- ^ eisse Line and won acquiescence for his rather moderate plans for inland. The latter included the 1940 frontier, a Soviet naval base at 9ngo or Petsamo, reparations to Russia, and a complete break with Germany. I he British were generally unsuccessful in obtaining their desires at c neran. They hoped to postpone Overlord and the projected campaign \" reopen the Burma Road, shifting the Burma equipment instead to the e gean, but were forced to accept a May 1944 target date for Overlord, ' e Stalin emphatically vetoed any Turkish, Aegean, or Balkan proj- / :ts - Stalin and Roosevelt did authorize Churchill to negotiate with urkey in an effort to persuade that country to go to war on Germany, ut »o one had much hope that these efforts would be successful, and osevelt and Stalin generally opposed them for fear they might delay Overlord. Roosevelt was mostly concerned with military questions at Teheran. 'Wing fixed a date for Overlord, he announced his decision to give the prenie command of that operation to Eisenhower. On the same day, as result of Stalin's announcement that the Soviet Union would go to war 1 Japan as soon as Germany was beaten, he made the decisive shift 'ar East strategv from the Chinese approach to the Pacific approach Japan, leaving the Japanese Asiastic forces to Russia rather than to e Chinese, and decided to allow the Burma campaign to languish. At e same time, lie asked Stalin for the use of heavy-bomber bases in Eu- pean Russia and in the Siberian Maritime Provinces. The Siberian ses were to be used against Japan, but never came into action because a m was reluctant and because the rapid American advance across the -p'fific \" avc the L T nired States substitute bases, especially on Okinawa. e \"ases in European Russia were to have been used for a \"shuttle- robing\" technique bv which American heavv bombers would flv from g and to Russia, and return, bombing Germanv on both trips. The a"},{"pageNumber":795,"pageContent":"780  TRAGEDY AND HOPE technique was used several times but could not be continued because the Russians did not provide sufficient antiaircraft protection for the eastern bases, with the result that the German Air Force bombed American planes on the ground with relative impunity and heavy losses. The Teheran Conference reached important conclusions regarding Iran and Yugoslavia. A joint declaration was signed and issued by which the three Powers agreed to maintain the independence, sovereignty, and ter- ritorial integrity of Iran. This was regarded as a victory for the Anglo- American cause, since Russian intrigues in Persia had been threatening i ts independence and integrity since the days of the czars and had been particularly objectionable since the Anglo-Soviet military occupation 0 the country in August 1041. This occupation had been undertaken to force the expulsion of about seven hundred German agents and tech- nicians, and was justified under the Soviet-Persian Treaty of 192 '• T' ia treaty permitted Russia to send troops into Persia if it were ever threat- ened by other forces. As the Russians occupied the northern portion 0 the country, the British occupied the south. Iranian public opinion W* sullenly submissive. The assembly accepted an Allied demand that the German, Italian, Romanian, and Hungarian legations be expelled, and week later the shah abdicated in favor of his son, Muhammad Riza \" a lavi. On January 29, 1942, Britain, the Soviet Union, and Iran signed a alliance by which the first two promised to respect and protect Iran integrity, sovereignty, and independence, while Iran gave the two \" 0% ers military control over the trans-Iranian trade route until six mon after the war ended, and promised as well to sever diplomatic relatio with all countries which had broken with the other two signers. Reorganization and reequipment of the trans-Iranian route under Am ican guidance made it possible to ship to the Soviet Union over route 5.5 million tons of supplies during the war. These efforts car a considerable disruption of Iranian life, especially by price inflation < acute food shortages, but the chief disturbance arose from Soviet po» ' actions in northern Iran. The Russians excluded most Iranian ornci and encouraged local separatist and revolutionary forces. On severa casions the United States secretary of state sent inquiries to Moscow a these activities, but never received a satisfactory reply. Thus, the Dec < tion of Teheran of December 1, 1943 was a diplomatic victory r° r West, for in it Stalin joined with Roosevelt and Churchill in guaran ing Iran's independence and integrity.    t    The Teheran agreement about Yugoslavia was even more sigm than the one about Iran, and could not, in any honesty, be called a torv for the West. The South Slav state had been suffering under a Axis occupation since the spring of 1941 and was also split by a war between two underground movements which spent more e e. fighting each other than they used to fight the Axis. The earlier or undergrounds, that of the Chetniks, supported the Yugoslav leg 111"},{"pageNumber":796,"pageContent":"WORLD WAR II: EBB OF AGGRESSION, I94I-I945 781 government now in exile in London; it was led by General Draza Mi- hajlovic, minister of war in the exiled government. The second under- ground movement, known as the Partisans, was Leftish and republican m lts sympathies and was dominated by the Communists led by Moscow- trained Josip Broz, known as Tito. Ihe contrast between these two underground movements was a sharp one , but to Churchill and Roosevelt these differences were largely ig- nored in favor of the more immediate question of which was more will- ln g to fight the Axis. The answer to that question, in Churchill's opinion Wa s Tito. For this reason Churchill at Teheran made the fateful' sugges- •on that the Allied supplies going to Yugoslavia be shifted from Mihajlo- Vlc to Tito and that Russia should send a military mission to Tito to join he British military mission already there. These suggestions were ac- Ce pted by the Big Three apparently without any clear idea of what this change in policy meant, but it was a change filled with significance since 11 meant that the Communists would control Yugoslavia in the postwar Period. This outcome was certainly not intended by at least two of the Kl g Three, but they were willing to overlook obvious facts in their ea gerness to defeat Germany. Among these obvious items was the fact that Mihajlovic represented the forces of royalism, of Serb centralism, an d of social conservatism, while the Partisans represented the forces of republicanism, of South Slav federalism, and of social revolution. Mihajlovic's reluctance to continue guerrilla attacks on the Axis forces °st him British support but was, from his point of view, the only possible ac tic. Every guerrilla attack on the Germans was answered by German epnsals on the Serbs in which thousands were massacred, undefended \"'ages were destroyed, and hundreds of peasants had to flee to the moun- ts where they were recruited into Partisan bands. Tito, who had no es ire to maintain the previous social, economic, or ideological structure Jugoslavia, had no desire to avoid German reprisals which simulta- neously destroyed the old social structure and provided recruits for his ar tisan forces. Accordingly, Tito was more willing to fight Germans, an d thus won the right to Allied support at Teheran. But Tito's willing- ess to fight Germans Mas only slightly more eager than that of Mihaj- Vl c, since the chief aim of each was to keep his forces strong enough to e ov er Yugoslavia when the Axis was driven out. Moreover, neither group, even w j t h Allied supplies, was sufficiently strong to drive the Xls ou t of the country or to take over control of any significant parts the country. The Italian forces in Yugoslavia were defeated by the nglo-American victory in Italy itself, while the German forces were irnately expelled by the advance of Soviet and Bulgarian forces from e east in the winter of 1944-1945. Nevertheless, the Teheran decision shift Allied supplies from the Chetniks to the Partisans was of major gnihcance in forming postwar Europe. * he Allied leaders parted after the Cairo and Teheran conferences"},{"pageNumber":797,"pageContent":"782  TRAGEDY AND HOPE in hopeful moods and proceeded to direct their full energies to military matters. Thus, there was no other important meeting until the Second Quebec Conference in September 1944, and no other meeting of the big Three until Yalta in February 1945. The nine months following Teheran were devoted to military matters of which the chief was Overlord, bc- gun on D-Day, June 6, 1944. The preparations for Overlord were among the most elaborate in mil* itary history. The planning, under British General Frederick E. Morgan, occupied almost a year before Eisenhower came to England to take com- mand in January 1944. The preparatory work involved the accumulation of enormous manpower and supplies in England, extensive intellig elice work and retraining of troops, detailed planning on a very large scale, the accumulation of much special equipment, including over 5,000 escort vessels and landing craft, two artificial floating harbors, numerous bloc ships and caissons for emergency piers, and strenuous exertions to over- come the German Air Force and submarine fleet before the project began- The Eighth American Air Force had been established in England m August 1942, but had not delivered the full impact of its attack because of constant diversion of men and planes to North Africa and the Mediter- ranean. At Casablanca in January 1943, the divergent British and Amer- ican ideas on aerial bombardment were reconciled in what was callc the \"Combined Bomber Offensive.\" The Americans believed that C> er \" many could be crippled to the point of paralysis by precision dayhg bombing on strategically chosen plants of German industry; the l\" 1 \" ish, who felt that daylight bombing would be too costly, placed the hopes in nighttime saturation bombing of whole areas, thus destroying civilian morale and exhausting German manpower as well as destroying military facilities. The Combined Bomber Offensive sought \"round-tn clock\" bombing of Germany by allowing each Ally to concentrate o its special type of attack. Gradually the very heavy casualties suffer by the Americans in daylight raids, along with recognition that \"pre c sion bombing\" was far too inaccurate to fulfill the goals set for it, p technical advances such as radar and radio-locating which improved precision of night bombing brought the Americans to some extent the British point of view.    ,    The Combined Bomber Offensive shifted its targets several times, a at the beginning of 1944 concentrated on the elimination of Gern fighting planes. This was achieved by killing off German pilots fas than they could be trained, a goal which was greatly assisted by the that fuel supplies in Germany were not sufficient to permit acieqi' training flights. In spite of Allied bombing on factories, German proa tion of fighter planes rose steadily in 1944 and was at 2,500 a month ] before D-Day. But pilot training, from lack of gasoline, had been from 260 to 100 hours and even in some cases to 50 hours. As a re"},{"pageNumber":798,"pageContent":"WORLD WAR II: EBB OF AGGRESSION, 1941-1945 783 °sses of planes from accidents were almost as high as losses from Allied action and, in February 1944, reached the extraordinarily high figure of ''3°o planes, half of the month's production of new planes. In the mean- im e, losses of American bombing planes on raids over Germany were Pproaching 10 percent, and in one case, over the ball-bearing factory at Miweinfurt, reached 25 percent of the planes sent. In the early onths of 1944 a series of raids on Berlin was launched with the delib- erate purpose of provoking the German fighter forces into combat so at they could be destroyed. This was a complete success. On the last these raids the Allied bombers were not attacked by German fighters a \", and by June the Allies had won complete aerial supremacy over Germany. , similar result, somewhat earlier and not so conclusive, was reached the antisubmarine warfare. In this effort, thanks to radar and com- 'fed air and sea attacks, the U-boats were driven completely from the °rth Atlantic. The turning point occured in .May 1943, when 30 per- nt of the German submarines which put to sea failed to return. The Umber of Allied ships torpedoed fell from 141 in March 1943 to 19 in , ne ! 944 and only 3 in August 1944. At the same time the Allied ship- iluing program was growing so rapidly that even in 1943, after losses been subtracted, it increased by almost 11 million tons. 1 he Germans were poorly prepared to cope with any Allied landing in le West. Two-thirds of their forces were fighting in Russia and eastern Uro pe, and the rest had to be spread from the Aegean to the Pyrenees thence north to Norway and Finland. The drain on German man- 1 o\\ver and vital materials was so great that the country grew steadily e aker. Still it fought on, the leaders becoming more and more ruthless _ more and more remote from reality until finally they were living in insane frenzy of hatred, suspicion, and frustration. Lack of manpower. Particularly of trained hands, and lack of materials, even of such ordi- ar y commodities as concrete or steel, made it impossible to strengthen e German defenses to the necessary degree. Above all, lack of gasoline ac te it impossible even to withdraw equipment before the advancing 'ssians. In the last two months of 1943, the German armies lost almost housand tanks and half as many self-propelled guns to Soviet forces. pairs became as difficult to achieve as new construction. In June 1943 e Germans had 2,569 operational tanks and 463 under repair; in Febru- J >944 the corresponding figures were 1,519 and 1,534. n the west the German defenses had, necessarily, been allowed to run (n vn in order to strengthen the Russian front. While there were a few ? ,() \" divisions in the west, the majoritv of the German forces there were Un its not prepared for combat, and totally lacking in mobility. The en were over-age or very young, physically unfit or convalescing, pre- \" r ed to serve as occupation police and beach-watchers but quite unfit"},{"pageNumber":799,"pageContent":"784  TRAGEDY AND HOPE for real fighting. There was even one division made up almost entirely 0 men with digestive disorders. Most divisions in the west were only tW regiments, and, because they were totally lacking in transport, they wet classified as \"static\" (not fullv combatant) units. Although Hitler had ordered the coast to be fortified, this was done almost nowhere, for lack of concrete and manpower. Allied aerial bom- bardment increased these lacks; almost a million men were engaged 1 air defense in Germany itself. Disruption of railway transportation mad it difficult to get the supplies that were available to the shore area. May, for example, with a daily need of 240 carloads of cement for on area, the arrival was 16 a day. When Rommel took over the active de- fense in the west, he ordered a continuous belt of land mines to laid, requiring, at a minimum, 50 million mines. Only 6 million were lai • Similarly, sea mines were ordered laid off the coast, plus a renewal 0 the mid-Channel mines which had been put down in 1943 and were no too old to function properly. The last could not be done at all, wru the coastal mines were put down in the wrong area. The chief German defensive forces were the Fifteenth Army defen - ing the Pas-de-Calais and the Seventh Army farther southwest in Not' mandy and Brittany. The Germans expected the attack to come in t Pas-de-Calais, since it was closer to England. They continued to belief this, even after D-Day, since they thought that the Normandy landing were merely a diversion preliminary to the main attack farther nort Moreover, the Germans were convinced that the attacks would com just before high tide in order to minimize the width of beach to cro and, accordingly, constructed their obstacles and laid mines down the half-tide mark only. Although the Allied cross-Channel attack was not a large one, being only five attack divisions preceded by parts of three airborne divisio < it was beautifully planned, competently carried out, and encountere number of very lucky chances, especially from the weather. The desired landing conditions were low tide, just after dawn, foll°^ ing a moonlit night. These occurred only once a month and lasted only three days.

Tactical surprise was achieved at all points, so completely, ln fact, that at Omaha Beach the strongest German coastal battery in the west was found unmanned and unguarded. Except at Omaha Beach, Where high bluffs had to be scaled under fire, the landings were immedi- at ely successful. At Omaha the issue hung on the balance into the second day. As a result, 2,000 casualties were suffered at Omaha compared to 2 °° at Utah Beach. As soon as the landings were established, men and equipment were Poured into the beachheads. A great gale of June 19th-2 3rd stopped all un- fading for two days and destroyed the American artificial harbor at tJmaha, but, by the time the gale began, there had been put ashore 62 9.ooo men, 95,000 vehicles, and 218,000 tons of supplies. The millionth m an landed on July 6th, just a month after the first. hi spite of this success, the Allied forces were hemmed in in Normandy f °r two months. On the left, the British forces under the cautious Mont- gomery were unable to take Caen; the American forces under General Bradley were stopped in the center before Saint-L6. Only on the right Was movement possible, to cross the peninsula (June 18th) and turn westward to storm and capture Cherbourg. This great seaport, taken With its 40,000 German troops on June 27th, was so devastated that it could not be brought into service until late in August, and Allied sup- P es continued to come in over the Normandy beaches. In the first 18 days of July, Caen and Saint-L6 were taken after severe ghting initiated by a terrific aerial bombardment by over 2,200 planes ich dropped 7,000 tons of explosives on one town and 4,000 on the 0 her.

On the whole these weapons, while frightening, used up large German resources and energies but achieved no military results. Equally spectacular was the attempt to assassinate Hitler by exploding a bomb concealed in a briefcase beside his chair at his headquarters in East Prussia. This was the last of several attempts of this kind, made by the same group which had tried in vain to negotiate with Chamberlain, Halifax, and Churchill in September i 9 ,8. The conspirators, mostly from the conservative upper classes, consisted chiefly of army officers, with a minority of civilian and diplomatic leaders. The chief \"military figures were Generals Ludwig Beck, Georg Thomas, Erwin von Witzleben, Karl von Stuelpnagel, and others; the chief civilian leader Mas Carl Goerdeler, one-time mayor of Leipzig; the chief intellectual figure was Count Helmut von Moltke, son of the German commander in chief of 1914; the leading diplomatic figures were the brothers Kordt, Theodor and Erich, the first in the London Embassy, while the second headed Ribbentrop's office in the Foreign Ministry; among those linked with the conspiracies in an ambiguous fashion were Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, chief of Military Counterintelligence, and Paul Schmidt, Hitler's personal interpreter. This group for years discussed ways of getting rid of Hitler and what should be done with Germany afterward. Sporadically they made at- tempts to kill the Fiihrer. All of these were unsuccessful because of a combination of bad luck, lack of resolution, and Hitler's extraordinary intuition. On July zo, 1944, however, success seemed near when Colonel Count Klaus Schenk von Stauffenberg, chief of staff of the Home Army, made his daily report to Hitler, and left the conference without picking up his briefcase, which rested against the leg of Der Fiihrer's chair. In the briefcase was an English-made bomb with a ten-minute fuse. When the bomb exploded, Stauffenberg gave the signal for the military units ifl Berlin, Paris, and elsewhere to seize control of these areas from\"the fanat- ical Nazi SS units. Unfortunately, Hitler's conference on July 20th, because of the heat, was held in a wooden shed instead of the usual concrete bunker. This allowed the explosion to dissipate itself. Moreover, a few seconds before the bomb went off, Hitler left his chair to go to a map on the most dis- tant wall of the conference room. As a result, some in the room were killed or badly injured, but Hitler escaped relatively unscathed. This was broadcast on the radio at once by the Nazis, and, by contradicting Stauf- fenberg's signal, threw the conspirators into sufficient confusion and ir- resolution to enable the SS and loyal Nazis to disrupt the plot.

A few, like Field Marshal Rommel, were allowed to commit suicide, as a special reward or their past services to the Nazis. iVs a consequence of this fiasco, the anti-Hitler opposition was destroyed, the most fanatical and least sane azis increased their power within Germany, any chance of negotiating peace—admittedly a remote possibility at all times—became impossible, j^u the inner administration of the Nazi regime became a complete mad- house.

As the latter slowly Cn ed southward toward Calais, a newly formed American Third Army, tostly armored, under General George S. Patton, drove southward from aint-L6 to Avranches (July 18-August 1). While some units turned es tward from Avranches into Brittany in an effort to capture addi- °nal seaports at Saint-.Malo, Brest, and Saint-Nazaire, the armored units Wung eastward to Le Mans (August nth) and then northward to Ar- ts Man, leaving only a narrow gap (Calais-Argentan) between American (l British forces, as an escape route through which eight shattered Gcr- , atl \"'visions might escape eastward (August 19-12, 1944)- Many broke rough, but 25,000 men were captured in this pocket, and the German ensue forces in France were completely disrupted.

This advance had to cross a series of famous river 1 the Seine, the Somme, the Aisne, and the Meuse. All were crossed wi»° difficulty because of weak German resistance.

This failure doomed the hopes for one v 'tal thrust across the Rhine to the Ruhr. By mid-December the Allied armies were struggling eastward toward the Rhine, in fog and rain, with short days and long nights. Conditions were particularly bad in the thick forests of the Ardennes. There the Germans determined to make their last counteroffensiv r e. Secretly con- centrating 25 divisions in weather too bad for air reconnaissance, the Germans struck westward, chiefly with armored forces, into General mar Bradley's Twelfth Army Group, splitting it wide open and threat- ening to break through over the Meuse. Although the First and Third mencan armies were separated by a German advance of over 60 miles, 0 vital points were reached largely because of the stubborn American distance, ev e n when surrounded, as at Bastogne. By December 26th le German drive had stopped, and three weeks later most of the lost ground had been recovered. In the attack the Germans inflicted casualties about 76,000 on the Americans, but suffered casualties of about 90,000 lemselves and used up irreplaceable supplies and equipment.

The Nazi leaders were too much absorbed in their own irrationalities to adopt such tactics as these, however, although the Soviet leaders continued to dread the possibility and convinced themselves, in spite of the contradictory evidence, that it was likelv. Accordingly, the Soviet advance became a race with the Western Powers, even though these Powers, by Eisenhower's orders, held back their advance at many points (such as Prague) to allow the Russians to occupy areas the Americans could easily have taken first. From midsummer of 1943 until the war's end in May 1945, the Soviet offensive in the east was almost continuous. In January 1944, Russian forces crossed the old border into Poland; in February they pushed the Germans back from besieged Leningrad, and, in the following month, they began a southern offensive which crossed the Prut into Romania. ' n July 1944, the Soviet armies reached the Vistula River, across from War- saw, and began an offensive to overrun Romania. These events raised in acute form the problem of who would rule over the liberated areas 0 eastern Europe. In general, the Anglo-Americans recognized the Russian need to security along their western frontier, but felt that this could be ob- tained if independent states with constitutional governments (in whic the Communist Party played a role) could be established in Polan . Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, and Yugoslavia. They saw no hope of libera ing the Baltic states from Russia, and paid little attention to Finland, was generally felt that Russian security in eastern Europe could be a sured if the victorious Powers, including Russia, could retain their urn, in the postwar period and operate together in a United Nations organic tion in peacetime as they had done in war. While the Western Powe recognized that the Russians had a justifiable suspicion of iriternatio organizations based on their unhappy experiences with the League Nations, it was felt that this could be overcome by the English-speaking Powers giving evidence of their new spirit of cooperation and by existence of regional arrangements, such as the Anglo-Soviet twenty-) alliance of May 26, 1942, or the French-Soviet agreement of Decern 10, 1944. All efforts to achieve some arrangement with Russia over lesser states was deeply involved with the indecisive negotiations a the fate of Germany.    .

The apparent conflict between the desire to reduce Germany's industrial level and the es ire to obtain reparations from her was glossed over temporarily by a P'an to dismantle German industrial plants as reparations for Russia. Inese agreements about Germany left unsettled at least three major questions and, in consequence, left Stalin with a strong feeling of insecu- v about Germany's future: there was no agreement whether Germany ould be dismembered or be treated as a unity, even under military oc- u pation; there was no agreement about the nature of the future German government; and there was no agreement about methods for permanent irorcenient of German disarmament and restricted industrial develop- ment. v *e need not narrate the continuous series of negotiations, temporary greements, misunderstandings, and reinterpretations which went on for ' ears among the Allied Powers regarding the fate of Germany and of le \"berated countries. The idea that the Soviet Union and the Anglo- f^erican Powers could continue to cooperate in peace as they had done vv 'ar, either by diplomacy and conference of their leaders or within n ie structure of international organization, was naive. Such a possi- 1 'ty was foreclosed by two factors: the fundamental underlying sus- P cions on both sides, even in wartime, and the very nature of the political Power of modern states. *or these two reasons, both sides, in the midst of reassuring public dements about their solidarity of outlook and plans for postwar co- operation, began to work toward another, more realistic arrangement of ^Pieres of interest and power balances. This alternative, and ultimately e vitable, path was adopted earlier by Stalin and Churchill than by Roosevelt, not because the latter was naive or ill but because he wanted smother the naked opposition of power balances by a chaotic blanket ; ie gal restrictions, conflicting public opinion, and alternative institu- na l arrangements which would hamper the outright operation of power \"nicts and which would allow men like himself to divert and post- P °c crises from day to day, while they improvised better economic social arrangements for their peoples in the successive intervals of H ace won from the postponement of forcible solutions to power con- c 'ts.

It is unlikely that Roosevelt had any alternative plan based on power politics to faJ back upon if his stated aims of postwar cooperation and United Nations failed. Churchill, on the other hand, while sincerely pursuing coopera- tive goals, had a secondarv outline based on power balance and spheres of interest. Stalin reversed Churchill's priorities, giving primary position to spheres of power and secondary, rather ironic, acceptance of coopera- tion and international organizations. So far as eastern Europe was concerned, the Stalin priorities made quite impossible anv mechanism of cooperation or international agree- ment. There can be little doubt that Stalin was determined to achieve security on the Soviet western frontier by establishing a buffer of states under complete Communist control. This covered Poland, Romania, an Bulgaria necessarily and any others he might get incidentally. He wa not concerned with Greece, Albania, or Austria, had little hope of g e \" ting Czechoslovakia, hoped to retain Yugoslavia, and had considerable, but unspecified, fears over Iran. The technique to be used to get Com- munist control over these states was similar to that used by Hitler i Austria: (i) to establish a coalition government containing Communis > (2) to get in Communist hands the ministries of Defense (the arm> r /> Interior (the police), and, if possible, Justice (the courts); (3) t0 u administrative decrees to take over education and the press and to crip- ple opposition political parties; and (4) to establish, finally, a complete ) Communist regime, under the protection of Soviet military forces necessary. The success of these steps in Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania was a sured, while the war was still going on, by the Western Powers a ceptance of coalition governments containing Communists as a necessa Y price for Soviet security locally and for Soviet cooperation elsewne (especially the Far East) and by the fact that Russian armies were occupation of the areas concerned. One of the first evidences of Churchill's alternative policy based 0 spheres of power was Eden's suggestion to the Soviet ambassador in k° don on May 5, 1944 that Britain would permit Russia to take the le in policv about Romania in return for Russian support for Britain s p ^ icies in Greece. This was defended as being based on \"military realitie , was opposed by Secretarv of State Hull, but was accepted by Roose\\ \"for a three months' trial.\" It led to an agreement between Churchill a Stalin, at the Moscow Conference of October 9-18, 1944, that Ang Soviet interests in the Balkans might be divided on a percentage ba with Russia predominant in Romania and Bulgaria, with England p dominant in Greece, and with Hungary and Yugoslavia divided n , fifty.

This agreement had little influence on Churchill's actions. He con- •nued to work for cooperative constitutional arrangements in eastern Europe and elsewhere. When Belgian Foreign Minister Paul Henri Spaak, , n the summer of 1944, sought to obtain a Western defense bloc, extend- *J|j from Norway to the Iberian Peninsula and including Britain, ^-hurchill and Eden both rebuffed the plan on the grounds that it would 1Vl de Europe into two blocs, Western and Soviet, which would outbid ac \" other for German support in the postwar world. The British chiefs staff, however, in the autumn of 1944, sought to establish, as an al- rnative policy, the dismemberment of Germany and the incorporation industrialized west Germany into Western defense plans in the event Kussian hostility in postwar eastern or central Europe. The British \" v \" Naders, led by Eden, in September and again in October, rejected ese General Staff suggestions and reiterated their determination to P u rsue a policy of unity and cooperation within the United Nations and renounce any efforts to form any anti-Soviet bloc, least of all with eririany. The chiefs of staff yielded, unconvinced, and warned of the e \" to prepare an alternative policy if the United Nations broke down ln g to differences with Russia and the need then arose to face a united ae rniany dominated by, or in collaboration with, Russia. n the meantime the Soviet Union, in 1944, under cover of the con- Ue d violence of war and the negotiations to establish a united postwar ia organization, took steps to establish its western buffer of Com- munized satellite states. n August 1944, Finland, Romania, and Bulgaria sought to get out of 'War. King Michael of Romania overthrew the pro-Nazi government General Antonescu and sent a delegation, led by a Communist, to scow to sign a formal armistice. The surrender, signed on September \"1 Was to the United Nations, but its enforcement was left to the le t High Command, with the Anglo-British members of the Allied f ol Commission relegated to the status of observers.

Growing evidence that the p r Serb Chetniks under royalist General Mihajlovic were collaborating with the Germans inclined the British to shift their support to Tito, b it proved as difficult to get the royal Yugoslav government-in-exile London to accept Tito as it was to get the latter to accept the roya government. A successful German attack on Tito, which forced him flee to the Adriatic islands, brought both sides to terms, and, in Octo 1944, royal Prime Minister Ivan Subasic agreed to join a Tito g over ment in which the Partisans would hold an overwhelming majority or c posts.

The number of women mobilized war production in the first four years of the conflict was 2.25 mill' 011 Britain compared to 182,000 in Germany. This relative ease of the Germans in the midst of history's most structive war was possible because of the convergence of a number factors of which the most significant were the slowness of industr, mobilization, the ruthless looting of occupied areas, and the working t° death of millions of enslaved peoples. As one consequence of this si tion, recognition that the war was lost came to the Germans, as it Pjj to Hitler, relatively late and with surprising suddenness, but the lea of the armed forces recognized their hopeless position a year, or even years, before the end. Fear of Hitler's terror prevented them from ta 5 any steps to end the war or even from mentioning it to Hitler, from of his rage; and their efforts to kill Hitler, though persistent, were p thetically incompetent. Thus Hitler's fanatical devotion to destruction made surrender imp sible and drove the war on to its bitter end. This bitterness was cain the majority of Germans bv the Combined Bomber Offensive, app by the Combined Chiefs of Staff on June 10, 1943.

These ideas were almost wholly fc> °red in the Soviet Union and were largely rejected in Germany; they e ated great controversy in France; and were accepted to a large extent ' 'nong airmen in Britain and the United States.

Relentless daily bombardmen, with heavy fighter escort, day after day, in spite of losses, with absoW refusal to be distracted to area or citv bombing because of losses or shtf ing ideas might have made a weighty contribution to the defeat or « many and shortened the war substantially. As it was, the contribution ) strategic bombing to the defeat of Germany was relatively incidental, spite of the terrible losses suffered in the effort. The shift to city bombing was more or less accidental. In spite 01 erroneous ideas of Chamberlain, Baldwin, Churchill, and the rest, t war opened and continued for months with no city bombing at all, the simple reason that the Germans had no intentions, no plans, an equipment for strategic bombing. The British, who had the intentions still lacked the plans and equipment, also held back. After the fall France, where almost all German bombardment was tactical or psy*-\" logical with the major exception of the attack on Rotterdam, the ria of Britain was fought and lost by tactical bombing on shipping and oc sional airdromes or airplane factories. The attack on cities began by accident when a group of German pia which were lost dumped their bomb loads, contrary to orders, on Lon on August 24, 1940.

This was a terrible shock to the Ger- mans, but had little impact on their ability to wage war. Since the British bomber Command had about 450 first-line bombers, a raid as large as that °n Cologne required use of all reserves and training planes, with instructors flying about a quarter of the planes. Of 1,046 planes sent off, 898 reached the target and dropped 1,455 tons °f bombs, with 40 planes lost in action and 12 more damaged beyond repair. In the city 474 persons were killed, S65 hospitalized, over 5,000 injured, 45,000 made homeless, and hundreds °f factories destroyed, yet the life of the city was back to normal in two weeks, with war production in the city back to normal in about six Weeks. The next thousand-plane raid (really 956), on Essen two days atter the attack on Cologne, was so ineffective, partly from cloudy leather, that the German air defense did not even report an attack on t-ssen that night, while reporting attacks on three other Ruhr cities. Improvements in finding their targets, heavier attacks, and the arrival of the American Eighth Air Force (which inaugurated \"round-the-clock ombing\" in 1943) increased the damage from strategic bombing of Germany, without reducing the scale of the German war effort. This ailure resulted from a number of factors which should be understood. !he chief one was that the Western governments had, from 1933 on, entirely misconceived the nature and amount of German munitions pro- duction. It was overestimated by a wide margin (twofold or threefold) in '933-1943, and was underestimated by an equal margin in 1943-1945. The ntl sh assumed that there was full industrial mobilization for war in Germany as early as 1938; but this was never achieved and was not even ^tempted until December 1943. Consequently, Germany, until the winter of 1944-1945, had a cushion °t immobilized resources which allowed an astonishingly rapid repair of °nib damage and an even more astonishing increase in production of war goods as late as January 1945. failure by the Western Powers to analyze the German war economy ed to changeable and misguided efforts to attack it.

Much effort was expended on bombing a most wholly unrewarding targets, such as airfields, submarine pens, ports, road yards, tank factories, and others.

Bv April 1944, with production of German fighter planes increasing rapidly, this effort had failed, and the Bomber Offensive at last turned, in May 1944, toward a vulnerable target: air- plane-fuel production. To this was added, in October 1944, an attack on the general rail and canal transport svstem. The fuel attack incidentally disrupted the chemical industry, and this combination, along With trans- portation, brought the German economic base for war to its knees W February 1945. The delay was partly caused by the lack of determination in concentrating on the targets selected and the constant attraction 0 the mirage of citv bombing. Even after May 1944, when the chief targe was fuel factories, onlv 16 percent of the bombs dropped were aimed a these, and 27 percent were still being thrown away on bombing civilia residences in cities. The importance of choosing the correct target strategic bombing mav be seen from one incidental, and probably ac- cidental, success. The Germans had only one factory producing c Maybach heavy HL engine used in their Tiger and Panther tanks. I was destroyed by an aerial bomb in 1944. This immobilized hundreds o these heavy tanks on the Russian front and contributed substantially a successful Russian breakthrough. The British effort to break German civilian morale by area night bom ing was an almost complete failure. In fact, one of the inspiring and ania ing events of the war was the unflinching spirit under unbearable atta shown by ordinary working people in industrial cities. This was as tru Russia (in Moscow and above all in Leningrad) as it was in Germany Britain (above all in the dock areas of East London). Attacks on tn peoples had a greater influence on the morale of their soldiers ngn l 0 on the front than it did on the suffering peoples themselves. The most extraordinary example of this suffering occurred H> British fire raids on Hamburg in 1943. For more than a week, begin 1 b on Julv 24th, Hamburg was attacked with a mixture of high-exp' oS1 and incendiary bombs so heavily and persistently that entirely new CO tforis of destruction known as \"fire storms\" appeared.

Nevertheless, the supply of ox .Vgen could not keep up with the combustion, and great layers of carbon monoxide settled in the shelters and basements, killing the people uddled there. Those who tried to escape through the streets were en- veloped in flames as if they were walking through the searing jet of a low-torch. Some who wrapped themselves in blankets dipped in water rom a canal were scalded as the water turned suddenly to steam. Hun- dreds were cremated, and their ashes dispersed by the winds.

This was the greatest destruction by air attacks on a city until he fire raid on Tokyo of March 9, 1945, which still stands today as the \"tost devastating air attack in human history. r he arrival of the American strategic air forces and the beginning of le Combined Bomber Offensive in the summer of 1943 gave a new turn o the air attack on Germany. The first great American effort, against chweinfurt, a city which produced 80 percent of German ball bearings, owed the difficulty of the American aim of precision daylight bombing ° f military targets (October 14, 1943). A force of 228 heavy bombers r «pped 450 tons of explosives on the target, but 62 planes and 599 men a ued to return. Such losses could not be sustained, and resulted from the ac t that escorting fighter planes were of such short range that they had turn back at the German border. As a result, Schweinfurt was not °mbed again for four months, during which most of its ball-bearing Production was dispersed to five small nearby towns. A series of well- •med attacks after February 21, 1944, cut production about a quarter in le next eight weeks, but this had little influence on Germany's fighting Power.     ,55     *ne figures on German munitions production are revealing.

Some of this, of course, can be attributed to the fact that the United States was taking over production of some items, but the chief cause was the un- believable economic mobilization of Germany in the year from December 1943 to December 1944. The relative costs of the strategic bombing effort may be shown in figures. The Americans and British together lost 40,000 planes and 158,906 airmen, almost equally divided between them. The Ger- mans suffered about 330,000 civilians killed, almost 1,000,000 injured, and about 8,000,000 made homeless; for the last year and a half of the war over 1,000,000 Germans were employed clearing and repairing bomb damage. All these things contributed indirectly to hamper the German war effort. The direct contribution of strategic bombing to the war effort came chiefly after September 1944, an d was to be found mainly in the disruption of fuel and transportation. Even this could have been' avoided if Hitler had been willing to take the advice of his subordinates and adopt proper defensive measures against the Western air attacks. Hitler himself in- sisted on priority of flak (antiaircraft guns) over fighter planes and of retaliatory bombing of England over defense by German fighter planes, both mistaken decisions. If the men and materials which Germany de- voted to its efforts to bomb England had been entirely used for defensive fighter planes, the influence of Allied strategic bombing on the outcome of the war would have been insignificant."},{"pageNumber":820,"pageContent":"WORLD WAR II: EBB OF AGGRESSION, IQ41-IQ45 805 Germany would still have been defeated, because in the long run its position was hopeless, once Hitler attacked Russia while Britain was still \"defeated.

In the late summer of 1944, two-thirds of eiT nany's fighting men were resisting the Russians in the east (2,000,000 all), with 300,000 in Italy and 700,000 elsewhere in the west.

In P'te of Hitler's verbal attacks on Communism, his real hatred was di- eted at the values and traditions of Western Civilization and at Christian , middle-class ways of life.

It had started the war with 6 million tons, added 3-5 *\" lion tons during the war from building and capture of foreign vesse - but had 8.2 million tons sunk during the war and finally surrendered w» only 231 vessels of 860,936 tons still able to operate. Of the loss, 5-' IT11 lion tons were sunk bv submarines, 2.3 million by aircraft, and 0.3 m , by mines. By the spring of 1945 Japanese merchant shipping was alrea ; below its minimum civilian-survival level. Immediately after Midway, the vital issue for the United States beca the need to stop the Japanese advance against Australia in the southwe ern Pacific. At that time the southern edge of the Japanese deren perimeter ran east and west through New Guinea just north of Austra • Its advanced base was Rabaul on New Britain Island, taken from Austra in January 1942.

Just before Midway the Japanese extended t» e threat 600 miles farther south from Rabaul, southwest to New Gum (thus threatening Australia) and southeast to Guadalcanal, the souther most of the Solomon Islands (2,375 IT >il es north of Wellington, r* Zealand).

The eastern American thrust, under naval control, sought to go northward through the Solomon Islands, then bypass Rabaul and Truk far to the east through the Marshall Islands, returning to the Tokvo road by attacking the Marianas from the Marshall Islands (700 miles east of Truk). This double movement is usu- ally referred to as a \"ladder\" in which alternative advances on either side D y the Americans led to Japanese counterattacks from Rabaul and Truk between the two legs. At first much of the fighting was piecemeal, with inadequate supplies »°r both sides, but American supplies continued to come, while Japanese support was much more intermittent. This eventually became the story °f the Pacific war, as American supplies, delivered from 6,000 or more miles away, buried the Japanese beneath water and earth. This struggle northward from Australia and New Zealand was to have been accom- panied by a third thrust, under General Joseph W. Stilwell and Lord Louis Mountbatten from India, across Burma, to reestablish connections With southwestern China. For some time it was expected that MacArthur and Stilwell, converging on China from the Philippines and Burma, would establish a mainland base from which the final assault on Japan could be made. The Burma Campaign, held up by the difficulties of the terrain and c °nstant diversion of men and supplies to other theaters, did not reach ^nina, over the hand-built Burma Road, until February 1945. MacArthur Was held up for two years (1942-1944) in the New Guinea area. Thus We must focus our attention on the eastern drive from New Zealand northward through the Solomons. \"pi.  o  mis eastern drive began on August 7, 1942, when Guadalcanal was nyaded by naval and marine forces from Wellington, New Zealand, 2,375 ues farther south. By February 8, 1943, after six months of horrible J ngj e combat, often without either air or sea support, the Solomons were conquered. Six dm\\ r n naval battles during the struggle greatly weakened e enemy surface forces, while his air forces were crippled. In the same P nod, Japanese advance bases were expelled from the Aleutian Islands, at least 135,000 enemy ground forces were left isolated in New Guinea and Rabaul. , y the autumn of 1943, the Allied forces had reached the great bar- r of the Japanese Mandated Islands in the central Pacific. These were r sed m a series of amphibious operations called \"island hopping.\" The of these, Tarawa, in the Gilbert archipelago, was a small operation comparison with subsequent \"landings,\" but its name still brings horror ose who remember it.

In February 1943, this experience was applied at Kwajalein, the worlds largest atoll, 560 miles north of Tarawa, and at Eniwetok, 340 miles west of Kwajalein, in the .Marshall Islands. In these landings Americans ha their first large-scale experience of the irrationalities of fighting Japanese. Officers of the .Mikado attacked tanks with ornamental swords, while privates sometimes killed themselves when they had Americans at their mercy. But usually they fought skillfully and tenaciously until the out- come was hopeless, when the}- made suicidal \"Banzai!\"' charges. These two landings cost 695 American dead to kill 11,556 Japanese. During these operations Admiral Raymond Spruance led a carrier task force in a strike on Truk which destroyed over 200 Japanese planes and a dozen naval ves- sels at a cost of 17 American aircraft. In the course of 1943 the American advance up the right leg of t Pacific \"ladder\" to Tokyo got so far ahead of schedule that sever* projected landings were eliminated, all future landings were advanced 1 date by a couple of months, and the whole weight of the advance vva shifted from its original project of a final assault on Japan from Fornio or the Asiatic mainland to an undated and unspecified amphibious attac from Pacific bases. This left three major problems: (1) the need for a island close enough to Japan for preliminary bombardment by land-base planes; (2) the possibility of very large American casualties when t Japanese invasion came off (possibly in 1946); and (3) what could done about the millions of Japanese ground forces in northern CJU and in .Manchuria. The last two of these problems led to efforts to obta Soviet intervention in the war against Japan; they meant, almost c tainly, that considerable concessions must be made to the Russians m r Far East and that the final assault on Japan must be left until sever months after the final defeat of Germany, to allow Soviet forces to shifted from Europe to the Far East. In the meantime, the need for air base for land-based bombers within range of Japan resulted in conquest of the Marianas Islands.   .   The Marianas were 700 miles north of Truk, over 1,000 miles no west of Eniwetok, and almost 1,600 miles from Tokyo.

Over 24,000 Japanese and 2,214 Americans were killed on the other two islands. Efforts by the Japanese fleet to disrupt the Marianas attack led to the attle of the Philippine Sea (June 19-20, 1944). This was another naval\" battle in which no surface vessels fired upon, or even saw, e ach other, since it was fought entirely in the air and under the sur- ace. On the opening day the Japanese lost 402 planes, while destroying American planes, and two of their carriers were sunk by American °niarines.

This engagement shattered the Japanese naval lr su Pport and left the Philippines open to American assault. *n September 1944, another amphibious attack landed in the Palau group of the western Caroline Islands, 1,175 miles directly west of r uk and only 610 miles directly east of Mindanao, the large southern and of the Philippines.

With over 1,000 American planes in the air at a time, this force destroyed 915 enemv planes and hundreds of naval ves- sels. Since Japanese naval planes had been critically reduced in the Battle of the Philippine Sea and since most of these destroyed in Halsey's sweep were land-based, the Japanese were critically short of trained pilots after October 17th, and began to adopt kamikaze (suicide) tactics. In these tactics half-trained pilots dived their planes, loaded with bombs, onto the decks of American ships. These new tactics inflicted severe losses on the Americans in the next few months. In the week of October 17-24, Halsey's Third Fleet was back on Leyte to cover the invasion force of 732 ships. In five days 132,400 me and 200,000 tons of supplies were landed against only moderate opp°\" sition. To destroy this landing the Japanese gave orders which r e \" suited in the Battle of Leyte, the largest naval conflict in history The eastern shore of the Philippines may be regarded as two very large islands, Luzon on the north and Mindanao to the south, separate by a cluster of smaller islands (the Visayas) which include almos contiguous Samar and Leyte on the eastern shore. Between Luzon an Samar was San Bernardino Strait, while, farther south, Leyte ant Mindanao are separated by Surigao Strait. The Japanese plan was send a small force as bait from Japan to entice Halsey's Third Fleet nort east from Luzon, while three other Japanese forces (one from Japan an two from Sinpapore) would secretly approach from the west, wi the Center Force under Admiral Takao Kurita passing through ^a Bernardino Strait, and the Southern Force under Admirals Kiyohi Shima and Shoji Nishimura passing through Surigao Strait to convert? on Admiral Frederick C.

All these major vessels were faster and heavier than comparable American sh ips but had little air cover, poor fire control, and inferior morale. On October 23rd the American submarines Darter and Dace torpedoed three ot Kurita's heavy cruisers, sinking two (including Kurita's flagship). While Kurita was being rescued from the water and dried out, Halsey, Warned by Darter, sent an air strike over the top of the Philippines and sank the 68,000-ton battleship Musashi with 19 torpedoes and 17 bomb nit s, and also knocked out a heavy cruiser. Hours earlier, Japanese land planes from Luzon made a strike at Halsey and were mostly destroyed, \" u t a single bomb, exploding in the carrier Princeton's bakery, set a fire Which ignited its torpedoes and aviation gasoline and blew it apart, in- nicting heavy casualties on the cruiser Birmingham which had come 0 the rescue.

Surprise was complete on both sides, at 6:47 A.M., when a patrol plane discovered Kurita's presence. The news had hardly registered, when the Japanese big guns opened fire. Fortunately, Kurita was completely disconcerted by the encounter, and believed he had run into Halsey's fleet. Sprague, under cover of smokescreens and rain squalls, tried to escape the heavy Japanese gunfire, while holding the enemy out of Leyte Gult by vigorous air strikes from his \"baby flat-tops\" and torpedo attacks from his destroyers. The Japanese shells, of 5- to 16-inch caliber, were al armor-piercing and went through the thin plates of Sprague's ves- sels without exploding; but, with up to forty holes each, these ships were soon leaking freely. They attacked so vigorously, however, using their 5-inch guns when all torpedoes were gone, that Kurita's fleet was scat- tered, and he decided to withdraw to regroup his forces. He had sun two American destroyers, an escort carrier, and a destroyer escort, bu lost three heavy cruisers in return. By this time (9:15 A.M.) air at- tacks were beginning to come in from all over the Philippines, and Run had received news that only one destroyer had survived the Souther Force's defeat at Surigao. He began to withdraw through San .Bernardino Strait. Sprague's escort carriers were much cut up, and still under heav) pounding from the earliest kamikaze attacks.

With a loss of only 3 F a nes, 16 square miles of central Tokyo were burned out; 250,000 uses were destroyed, over a million persons were made homeless and 4-793 were killed. This was more destructive than the first atomic omb over Hiroshima five months later. ihe conquest of Okinawa was a much bigger task than Iwo Jima; 760 1 es west of Iwo, it was only 360 miles from the Chinese mainland, and most the same distance from both Formosa and Japan.

The degree and kind of resistance from the Japanese at Okinawa raise grave questions regarding the final defeat of Japan. By May iQ45' * major part of the Japanese population was completely disillusioned wit the war and eager to find a way out of it. These sentiments were share by most of the civilian leaders and by a good portion of the naval leaders. Some of the army, however, still believed that thev could make the costs of an American invasion of Japan too high to be acceptable to America opinion. Somewhat similar ideas occurred to some of the America leaders. These Japanese fanatics believed that they could get a tnajo part of Japan's fighter-plane construction dispersed and placed under- ground by mid-September 1945. If these facilities were used to bui cheap, uninstrumented kamikaze planes manned by untrained soici e volunteers (who were available in large numbers) and supplemented t>> human torpedoes, it might be possible to inflict unbearable losses on any American invasion of Japan itself. As part of this project the Japanese had perfected a manned g> lde bomb, called Baka (foolish) bv the Americans, which carried a man an 2,645 pounds of trinitroanisol in a 20-foot fuselage with 16.5-foot wing span.

V. Soong, about June '0, 1945. u uring this period, the Great Powers were thoroughly disillusioned ir h China. A generation of almost constant warfare under a govern- ent lacking in energy or principles had brought the whole organization the verge of dissolution. Trade had reached a point of semicollapse; ation was rampant; capital of the most fundamental kinds, such as arm tools, roads, and communications, Mas worn out; 90 percent of e railroads were out of operation; and the chief concern of almost all mese was survival. The existing political divisions offered little hope remedying any of China's ills even after Japan had been defeated. e dominant Kuomintang Party was shot through with corruption and complacency and seemed to have few concerns except remaining in omee. Its chief aim seemed to be to maintain its armed blockade of the ommunist forces operating out of Yenan in northwestern China. There the highly disciplined Communist armies had taken over the area and Ppeared to have gained some degree of local support. American hopes of fusing the two parties into a common and energetic unese government, however, broke down on the refusals of the Kuo- Wmtang and the remoteness of the Communists. The Russians seemed to Ve '\"tie interest in these matters, and Stalin made it clear, in his con- tsations with his Western colleagues, that he had little concern with situation beyond his rigid determination to secure the specific and stnc tly li m i te d goals established by his vision of Russian national in- ests. He had little sympathy for the Chinese Communists or for the inese in general, regarded Chiang Kai-shek as the best of a poor lot, ' ri SCemec ^ f^Jfy prepared to allow the United States to try its own e pendent hand in working out any agreements it wished in respect 0 the governing of China. s became clear even in 1944, however, the United States was not o g to get its wishes in China even when it could decide what those ,. s es w ere.

The making of the first atomic bombs is surelv the most amazing story of World War II. It is a long, complex, and technical study whi?P most historians would like to omit, but it is not possible to understan the history of the mid-twentieth century without some understanding of how this almost unbelievable weapon was achieved and especially wy the Western Powers were able to achieve it and the Fascist Pow'£ r were not. The gist of this story will be told in the next chapter. He* e we need only record that the United States obtained its first three atom bombs over a three-week period from Julv 15 to August 10, J 945- The theory on which the nuclear explosions were based was known the scientists of all countries before April 1939, and the direction 1 which practical efforts to achieve a bomb must go were established a equally known before worldwide secrecy descended a year later, April 1940, just before the fall of France. Scientific ignorance, howeve 1 was so universal among political and military leaders throughout t world that the use of the existing scientific knowledge would not nav been achieved anywhere but for two factors: (1) many of the WQfl greatest nuclear scientists had fled as refugees from Fascism to Engla and the United States, and (2) Franklin Roosevelt was quite willing listen to unconventional suggestions if his attention could be obtain^- In the years 1939-1941 the refugee scientists in the United States w so fearful that Hitler would obtain the atomic bomb that they were a to prevail upon the best known among them, Einstein, to allow his na to be used to catch Roosevelt's attention. Once this had been done, urging of these same scientists and the growing urgency of the war 1 made it possible for the administrative talents of American scientists utilize the enormous resources made available to them to reach the g they sought. After September 1942, Brigadier General Leslie R. Gro ' U.S.A., was in charge of the whole project and, in an atmosphere fanatical secrecy, brought it to a successful conclusion with an exp ture of about $2 billion and the work of about 150,000 persons. In this, as in other matters, the sudden death of President Rooseve April 12, 1945 had a great and incalculable effect. Vice-President man knew nothing of the atomic-research program until he was ^o it by Secretary of War Henry Stimson, briefly on April 12th an _ greater length two weeks later.

The new secretary of state, however, had been serving as \"Assistant President\" largely concerned with domes- lc questions, and he was almost as unfamiliar with the main problems °* ^reign policy as Truman himself. The problems which Truman, Byrnes, and their advisers faced in reestablishing the peace of the world were greatly intensified by the structionism of the Soviet government and by the fact that Winston nurchill had set an election in England, the first in ten years, for July '' '945' to renew his government's mandate. The result was not clear nt 'l July 27, 1945, because of the need to count absentee ballots from 'fliers overseas, but these eventually showed a smashing two-to-one Victory 0 f crie Labour Party over Churchill's Conservatives. 1 bus Byrnes became secretary of state only on June 30th.

The tran- •on was made somewhere easier by the fact that Attlee had been deputy F 'me minister since 1942 and had been on the British delegation to °tsdam from the opening of the conference. Nevertheless, the fact that ^ alin Was the sole survivor of the Big Three heads of government who conferred so often during the war undoubtedly weakened the West \"1 this last, \"Terminal,\" conference. n general, the American delegation seemed to regard as its chief aims seek to continue the Big Three cooperation into the postwar world \"in the structure of the United Nations whose charter had been °pted at San Francisco on June 25th.

This somewhat modi version of the Morgenthau scheme (which had sought the conip ruralization of German economic life to an agrarian basis) was modi almost at once by a number of factors. The first modifying factor was the desire for reparations. The A icans insisted that reparations must be taken, as far as possible, existing stocks and plants rather than from future production (a plete reversal of the American position of 1919) in order to avoi error of the 1919-1933 period, the overbuilding of German capita 1 en V ment and American financing of German reparation payments in indefinite future.

This and the millions of Germans streaming westward to seek refuge beyond the reach of vengeful Russians, Poles, and Czechs played a great role in arousing sympathy for Germans in the west and in estab- ishing a common front of cooperative work and mutual dependence in f hat area. On July 26, 1945, Truman, Attlee, and Chiang Kai-shek issued an a mbiguous ultimatum to Japan, warning the latter that it must accept •nimediate unconditional surrender or suffer complete and utter de- duction. This was regarded bv the three leaders as a threat of atomic uolocaust unless Japan laid down its arms, but the atomic threat was unspecified and, to the Japanese, meaningless, while their chief concern, Whether \"unconditional surrender\" meant removal of the emperor, was equally unspecified. The Japanese premier. Admiral Kantaro Suzuki, * ho had been put into office to find a way out of the war, was caught n a trap.

The age which began in 1945 was a new age 0r n almost every point of view. Looking back, it is now clear that e nrst generation of the twentieth century, from about 1895 to 1939, as a long period of transition from the nineteenth-century world 0 a totally different world of the twentieth century. Some of these an ges are obvious: a shift from a period of democracy to an age experts; from a world dominated by Europe, and even by Britain, 0 a World divided into three great blocs; from a world in which man \"l lived, as he had for a million years, surrounded bv nature, to a Nation where nature is dominated, transformed and, in a sense, totally estroyed by man; from a system where man's greatest problems were e material ones of man's helplessness in the face of the natural threats disease, starvation, and the unpredictability of natural catastrophes to ^ e totally different system of the 1960's and 1970's where the greatest re at to man is man himself, and where his greatest problems are the Cla l (and nonmaterial) ones of what his true goals of existence are and at u se he should make of his immense power over the universe, in- udin g his fellow 'men. °r thousands of years, some men had viewed themselves as creatures a ie lower than the angels, or even God, and a little higher than the asts. Now, in the twentieth century, man has acquired almost divine \" w ers, and it has become increasingly clear that he can no longer re g a rd himself as an animal (as the leading thinkers of the nineteenth ntury did), but must regard himself as at least a man (if he cannot ln g himself to break so completely with his nineteenth-century pred- 83."},{"pageNumber":847,"pageContent":"832  TRAGEDY AND HOPE ecessors as to come to regard himself as obligated to act like an angel or even a god). The whole trend of the nineteenth century had been to emphasize man's animal nature, and in doing so, to seek to increase his supply 01 material necessities, his indulgence in creature comforts, his experiences of food, movement, sex, and emotion. This effort had resulted in the sharp curtailment or almost total neglect of the conventions of mans earlier history, conventions which had been, on the whole, based on a conception of man as a dualistic creature in which an eternal spin tual soul was encased, temporarily, in an ephemeral, material body. This older conception had been embodied, in the form in which the nineteenth century challenged it, largely in the seventeenth century, and had been reflected in that earlier period in the widespread influence of Puritanism, of Jansenism, and of other, basically pessimistic, inhibiting, masochistic, and self-disciplining ideologies. The eighteenth century had been a long age of struggle to get free of this older, seventeenth-century outlook, air- had been so prolonged largely because those who turned away f rorn the seventeenth century\" could neither envisage, nor agree upon, the newer ideology they wanted to put in the place of the older one they wished to reject. This newer ideology was found in the nineteenth century, and may be regarded as one which emphasized man's freedom to indulge his mor animal-like aspects: to obtain freedom, for his body, from disease, deat 1, hunger, discomfort, and drudgery. This movement eventually g ave u modern surgery and medical science, modern technology, mass p r0 \" duction of food and other consumers' goods, central heating, indoo plumbing, domestic lighting, air conditioning, and the plethora of so- called labor-saving devices. The outlook behind these achievements may be symbolized by Charles Darwin, whose writings came to stand to proof of the animal nature of man, and of Sigmund Freud, whose wri - ings were taken to show that sex was the dominant, if not the so . human motivation and that inhibitions were the great bane of hunia life. This latter point of view came to be accepted on the most pervasn level of human experience in the attacks on inhibitions and discip\" which we call \"progressive\" education as represented in the outpouring of such semipopular thinkers as Rousseau in the earliest stage of movement (in E?ftile) or John Dewey in the latest stage. We who enter the twentieth century must not assume, as earlier ag so often did, that our immediate predecessors were wrong and that w should seek a point of view which appears true largely because it opposed to them. This mistaken method of human progress has led m in the past to oscillate over the centuries from one extreme point view to its opposite, and then, a few generations later, back again. 1» ' the humanism of the sixteenth century had reacted against the scho a"},{"pageNumber":848,"pageContent":"THE NEW AGE  833   icism of the medieval period and was reacted against in turn by the Puritanism of the seventeenth century, the materialism of the nineteenth Ce ntury, and the reaction against this latest outlook by the \"flight from jeedom\" and blind mass discipline of reactionary totalitarianism in the 'ascist and Nazi aberrations. It should be evident by now that truth is a remote goal which man a Pproaches by walking, a process in which one foot is always behind ne other foot. The true and final goal of man as we know him must e a synthesis of varied elements, because man is so obviously a creature ot varied nature. And our imperfect vision, both of man's nature and ot the universe in which he operates, must be a consensus of divergent P°ints of view, since man's obviously limited vision permits each indi- 'dual, group, or age to see the truth in a partial fashion only. Any °nsensus, however temporary, must be a reconciliation of such diver- K en t and partial views to provide a more adequate (but still temporary) total view. ihis can be seen most essentially in the fact that the great achieve- en ts of the nineteenth century and the great crisis of the twentieth cntury are both related to the Puritan tradition of the seventeenth century. The Puritan point of view regarded the body and the material orl d as sinful and dangerous and, as such, something which must be ernly controlled by the individual's will. God's grace, it was felt, would 6 lv e the individual the strength to curb both his body and his feelings, c °ntrol their tendencies toward laziness, the distractions of pleasure, the diversions of enjoyment, and make it possible for the individual, J total application to work, to demonstrate that he was among the chosen recipients of God's grace. his Puritan outlook, rejected outwardly in the nineteenth century's . 10n °f the truth, was, nevertheless, still an influential element in the eteenth century's behavior, especially among those who contributed st to the nineteenth century's achievement of its own goals. The 'tan point of view contributed elements of self-discipline, self-denial, ochism, glorification of work, emphasis on the restrictions of enjoy- ,. of consumption, and subordination both of the present to the r e and of oneself to a larger whole.

These methods appeared in a number of essential ways, notably in an emphasis on self-discipline for future benefits, on restricted consumption and on saving, which provided the capital accumulation of the nineteenth century's industrial development; in a devotion to work, and in a post\" ponement of enjoyment to a future which never arrived. A typical ex- ample might be John D. Rockefeller: great saver, great worker, and great postponer of any self-centered action, even death. To such people, and to the prevalent middle-class ideology of the nineteenth century, the most adverse comments which could be made about a \"failure,\" to dis- tinguish him from a \"successful\" man, were that he was a \"wastrel, a \"loafer,\" a \"sensualist,\" and \"self-indulgent.\" These terms reflected the value that the middle classes placed on work, saving, self-denial, an social conformity. All these values were carried over from seventeentn- century Puritanism, and were found most frequently among the religi° u groups rooted in that century, the Quakers, Presbyterians, Nonconfor- mists (so called in England), and Jansenist survivals, and were lc evident among religious groups with older orientations, such as Roman Catholics, High Anglicans, or orthodox Christians. These older crce were more prevalent among the lower and the upper classes and 1 southern and eastern Europe rather than in northern or western Europe- This explains why the energy, self-discipline, and saving which made t world of 1900 was middle class, Protestant, and northwestern European- As we shall see later, in discussion of the American crisis of the twentie century, these outlooks, values, and groups are now being supersede by quite different outlooks, values, and groups.

Both of these together (future preference and expansible material demands) were basic features in nineeteenth-century middle-class society, and indispensable foundations for its great material achievements. They are inevitably lacking in backward, tribal, under- developed peasant societies and groups, not only in Africa and Asia but also in many peripheral areas and groups of Western Civilization, includ- ln g much of the Mediterranean, Latin America, central France, or in the \"lennonite communities of southern Pennsylvania and elsewhere. The 'ack of future preference and expansible material demands in other areas, and the weakening of them in middle-class Western Civilization, are essential features of the twentieth-century crisis. Though this crisis, which has appeared as a breakdown, disruption, and rejection of the nineteenth century's way of doing things, was fully evident by the year 1900, it was brought to an acute stage by the two World wars and the world depression. If we may be permitted to over- sirnplify^ two antithetical ways of dealing with this crisis appeared. One Wa y, going back to men like Georges Sorel {Reflections on Violence, •9o8), sought a solution of this crisis in irrationalism, in action for its <nv n sake, in submergence of the individual into the mass of his tribe, immunity, or nation, in simple, intense concrete feelings and acts. The other tendency, based on nineteenth century's science, sought a solution °* the crisis in rationalization, science, universality, cosmopolitanism, and the continued pursuit of eternal—if rapidly retreating—truth. While ne great mass of people in Western Civilization either ignored the prob- eni and the antithetical character of the two proffered solutions, drifting Ur >consciously toward the one or struggling confusedly toward the other, w o smaller groups were quite aware of the antithesis and rivalry of the |Vo. From the crisis itself and the myriad individual events which led \"rough it, came World War II. Although few were consciously aware °* ir > this war became a struggle between the forces of irrationality, ^presented by F ascism, and the forces of Western science and rationaliza- tlo n, represented by the Allied nations. 1 he Allied nations won this fearful struggle because they represented he forces of the ancient traditions of the West which had made Western •vilization the most powerful and most prosperous civilization that had er existed in the past six thousand years of experience of this form of u man organization. This ability to use the Western tradition appeared n a capacity to use rationalization, science, diversity, freedom, and vol- ntary cooperation—all long-existent attributes of Western Civilization."},{"pageNumber":851,"pageContent":"836  TRAGEDY AND HOPE Rationalization and Science The application of rationalization and science to World War II is ° n of the basic reasons (although not necessarily the most important rea- son) for the victory of the West in the war. As a consequence of t» a victory, these two methods survived the challenge from reactionary, to talitarian, authoritarian Fascism, and expanded from the limited areas human experience where they had previously operated to become do inant factors in the twentieth-century world. The two are obviously n identical; and neither is equivalent to rationalism (although both use P tionalism as a prominent element in their operations). Rationalism, stric ) speaking, is a rather unconvincing ideology. It assumes that reality is tional and logical, and, accordingly, is comprehensible to mans co scious mental processes, and can be grasped by human reason and log alone. It assumes that what is rational and logical is real, that what not rational and logical is dubious, unknowable, and unimportant, and Hi the observations of the human senses are unreliable or even illusory- Rationalization and science differ from rationalism in two chief way • (1) they are more empirical, in that they are willing to use sense obse tions, and (2) they are more practical, in that they are more concern with getting things done in the temporal world than they are with covering the nature of ultimate truth. They do not necessarily deny existence of such an ultimate truth, but they agree that any conclusi reached about its nature, using their methods, are proximate rather ultimate. Both methods, thus, are analytical, tentative, proximate, mo and relatively practical. The chief difference between them is that sci is a somewhat narrower subdivision of rationalization, because it 1 more rigid and self-conscious methodology. 1 Western Taken together, these two have played significant roles in v> c Civilization for centuries, but have always remained somewhat perip to the experience of ordinary' men.

It was reserved largely for academic people, and for a small minority of these, and it touched the lives of most men only indirectly, by its influence on tech- nology, especially on medical practice, transportation, and communica- tions. There was very clearly, before 1930, what Sir Charles Snow has called \"Two Societies\" in our one civilization. This meant that most men ived in an ignorance of science almost as great as that of a Hottentot a nd almost equally great among highly educated professors of literature at Harvard, Oxford, and Princeton. It also meant that scientists were Suite out of touch with the major realities of the world in which they ly ed, and were smitten by the impacts of war, depression, and political 'sturbances under conditions of ignorance, naivete, and general baf- flement at least as great as that of the uneducated ordinary man. World v ar II brought science into government, and especially into war, and rought politics, economics, and social responsibility into science in a *ay which must be beneficial to both but which was almost unimaginably s locking to both. Reading, for example, the interchange of questions and ' nswers which go on between scientists and politicians before congres- !onal committees concerned with outer space, atomic energy, or medical Search is a revelation of the almost total lack of communication which akes place behind that prolific interchange of words. Ihe impact of rationalization is almost as great, although much less ^cognized. It had alw 'ays existed in an incidental and minor way in men's x periences, but hardly justified a special name until it became a con- cious and deliberate technique. It is a method of dealing with problems and processes in an established sequence of steps, thus: (1) isolate the problem; (2) separate it into its most obvious stages or areas; (3) enu- erate the factors which determine the outcome desired in each stage or rea ; (4) vary the factors in a conscious, systematic, and (if possible) 4 antitative way to maximize the outcome desired in the stage or area ftcerned; and (?) reassemble the stages or areas and check to see if the oie problem or process has been acceptably improved in the direction ouch rationalization is analytical and quantitative (even numerical). %Va s first used on an extensive scale at the end of the nineteenth cen- rv to solve problems of mass production, and led, step by step, to a ssembly-ii ne techn iques in which regulated quantities of materials ^parts), power, labor, and supervision were delivered in a rational ar- gernent of space and time to produce a continuous outflow of some product.

Naturally, such a process serves to dehumanize the pro-"},{"pageNumber":853,"pageContent":"838  TRAGEDY AND HOPE ductive process and, since it also seeks to reduce every element in c \" process to a repetitive action, it leads eventually to an automation 1 which even supervision is electronic and mechanical. From the basically engineering problem of production, rationalizatio gradually spread into the more dominant problem of business. From maximizing production, it shifted to maximizing profits. This gave rise \"efficiency experts\" such as Frederick Winslow Taylor (whose 1 • Principles of Scientific Management appeared in 1911) and, eventual y, to management consultants, like Arthur D. Little, Inc. This point had been reached by 1939, when rationalization was s • remote from ordinary life and very remote from politics and war. in so many other innovations, the introduction of rationalization in war was begun by the British and then taken over, on an enormous sea . by the Americans. Its origin is usually attributed to the efforts of Prore sor P. M. S. Blackett (Nobel Prize, 1948) to apply radar to antiaircraft guns. From there Blackett took the technique into antisubmarine defense, whence it spread, under the name \"Operational Research\" (OP), in many aspects of the war effort. In its original form, the Anti-Aircra Command Research Group, known as \"Blackett's circus,\" included tnre physiologists, two mathematical physicists, one astrophysicist, a survey > a general physicist, two mathematicians, and an army officer. It \"' aS mixed-team approach to operational problems, emphasizing an objectiv ' analytical, and quantitative method. As Blackett wrote in 194', , scientist can encourage numerical thinking on operational matters, a so can help to avoid running the war on gusts of emotion.\" Operational research, unlike science, made its greatest contribution regard to the use of existing equipment rather than to the effort to vent new equipment. It often gave specific recommendations, reac through the techniques of mathematical probability, which directly c° tradicted the established military procedures. A simple case concern the problem of air attack on enemy submarines: For what depth sho the bomb fuse be set? In 1940 the RAF Coastal Command set its f uS at 100 feet. This was based on estimates of three factors: (1) the ti interval between the moments the submarine sighted the plane and t plane sighted the submarine; (2) the speed of approach of the plane; a (3) the speed of submergence of the submarine. One fixed factor that 'the submarine was unlikely to be sunk if the bomb exploded mo than 20 feet away. Operational Research added an additional factor: H near was the bomber to judging the exact spot where the submarine we down? Since this error increased rapidly with the distance of the ong 1 sighting, a submarine which had time to submerge deeply would aim inevitably be missed by the bomb in position if not in depth; but, J* 100-foot fuses, submarines which had little time to submerge were mi because the fuse was too deep even when the position was correct."},{"pageNumber":854,"pageContent":"THE NEW AGE  839  rec onimended setting fuses at 25 feet to sink the near sightings, and Practically conceded the escape of all the distant sightings. When fuses ' e re set at 35 feet, successful attacks on submarines increased 400 per- Cent with the same equipment. I he British applied OP to manv similar problems: (1) With an inade- quate number of A.A. guns, is it better to concentrate them to protect P ar t of a city thoroughly or to disperse them to protect all of the city '\"adequately? (The former is better.) (2) Repainting night bombers r ° m black to white when used on submarine patrol increased sightings submarines 30 percent. (3) Are small convoys safer for merchant 'P s than large ones? (No, by a large margin.) (4) With an inadequate mber of patrol planes, was it better to search the whole patrol area 0nie days (as was the practice) or to search part of it every day with atever planes were available? (Calculations of a mathematician, S. D. °'sson, who died in 1840, showed that the latter was better.) ^onie of OP's improvements were very simple. For example, a statistical d . v °f sightings of German submarines by patrol planes showed that lc e as many were seen on the left side of the plane as on the right e ' Investigation showed this was because the plane flew on automatic P 1 °t, allowing the pilot (on the left side) almost full time to watch the 1 while the copilot on the right side was busy much of the time. As- 5 n ment of another crewman to the right side when the copilot was busy creased sightings about 30 percent. Until late 1941 the RAF bombed e mian cities as thev were able. Then OP, using the German bombing Britain as a base, calculated the number of people killed per ton of nibs dropped, and applied this to Germany to show that the casual- mnicted on Germany were about 400 civilians killed per month- ut half the German automobile-accident death rate—while 200 RAF rc wnieri ould ne *at the wmen were killed per month in doing the bombing. Such bombing d never influence the outcome of the war. Later it was discovered raids were really killing only 200 German civilians (almost all non combantants contributing little to the war effort) at the cost of the KAP fighting men each month, and thus were a contribution to a tnian victory! These estimates made it advisable to shift planes from . ln g Germany to U-boat patrol, so that the German submarine war, cn was really strangling Britain, could be brought under control. A \"toer, in its average life of 30 missions, dropped 100 tons of bombs Germany, killing 20 Germans and destroying a few houses. The same . e m thirty missions of submarine patrol saved, on the average, 6 ed merchant vessels and their crews from submarines. As might be pected, this discovery was violently resisted by the head of the RAF omber Command, Chief .Marshal Sir Arthur (\"Bomber\") Harris. osely linked with this was the question whether it was better to use ain s shipbuilding capacity to construct escort vessels or merchant"},{"pageNumber":855,"pageContent":"040  TRAGEDY AND HOPE ships. This involved the choice between saving existing merchant ships or outbuilding the losses from submarines. It required a statistical study of the effectiveness of escort vessels. At the time, the Admiralty regarded small convoys as safer and large ones as dangerous, and had forbidden convovs of over sixty ships. Thev assigned escort vessels to each convoy at the rate of three plus one-tenth of the number of ships protected. ^ r was able to show that this assignment rule was inconsistent with the pre)\" udice against large convoys. Studying past losses, they showed that con- voys of under 40 ships (averaging 32 each) suffered losses of 2.5 percen . while large convoys of over 40 ships (averaging 54 ships each) wer twice as safe, with losses of only 1.1 percent. Using information from res- cued German U-boat crews, OP was able to show that U-boat success depended on the densitv of escort vessels around the perimeter of t' 1 convoy and that the percentage of ships sunk was inversely proportions to the size of the convov. Bv 1944 a convoy of 187 ships arrived witnoi loss. If the shift to large convovs had been made in the spring of 194\" rather than in the spring of 1943, a million tons of merchant shipp in s (or 200 ships) could have been saved. The combination of larger coi voys, and the shift of some planes from bombing Germany to subnian patrol, turned the corner on the U-boat menace in the summer of r 943 and helped save many ships which were used in the Allied amphibio landings, especially on D-Dav in 1944. The shock of the fall of France in June 1940 marked a turning p 01 in the relations between universities and government in the United btfi • At that time, the chief contacts between the two were the Nation Academy of Sciences, founded in 1863, and the National Advisory Co mittee for Aeronautics (NACA), founded in 1915.

Rationalization of behavior, as represented in Operations Research and the application of science to new weapons, as practiced by tne English-speaking countries, were in sharp contrast with the methods 0 waging war used by the Tripartite aggressors. Hitler fought the war b} basing his hopes on inspiration (his own) and willpower (usually, refusa to retreat an inch); Mussolini tried to fight his war on rhetoric and slo- gans; the Japanese tried to gain victory by self-sacrifice and vvilling ne to die.

By the end of the war, the tech- nique had spread extensively through the American war effort, and, W the arrival of peace, became an established civilian profession. The bes known example of this is the Rand Corporation, a private research a development firm, under contract to the United States Air Force, numerous lesser organizations and enterprises are now concerned *> rationalization techniques in political life, the study of war and strateg, > in economic analysis, and elsewhere.

A great impetus has been given to the rationalization of society i' 1 postwar world by the application of mathematical methods to society an unprecedented degree. Much of this used the tremendous adva in mathematics of the nineteenth century, but a good deal came from developments.

These, and related techniques, are now trans- °rming methods of operation and behavior in all aspects of life and 'nging on a large-scale rationalization of human life which is becoming ne of the most significant characteristics of Western Civilization in the twentieth century. Uosely related to all this, both in the war and in the postwar period, ^ve been advances in science. Here, also, the great impetus came from e stru ggle for victory in the war and the subsequent permeation of all Pects of life by attitudes and methods (in this case science) which had en peripheral to the experience of most people in the prewar period. le consequences of this revolution now surround us on all sides and e obvious, even to the most uncomprehending, in television and elec- onics, in biology and medical science, in space exploration, in automa- ° n of credit, billing, payroll, and personnel practices, in atomic energy, a above all in the constant threat of nuclear incineration which now J ces all of us.

Une of the chief advances here was Watson-Watt's use of a cathode Vacu um tu be (such as we now use in television) to watch the returning 10 signal. This signal^ sent out from a radio vacuum tube in pulses, turned through a crystal detector to appear as a \"blip,\" or spot, on the c athode tube's fluorescent screen.

A rocket avoids the first two of these prob- lems because it directs the recoil forward to push the rocket, and needs no container barrel at all. The Russians, who had greatly developed the use of rockets, used them in large numbers against the Germans in I94 1, Since rockets need no barrel to shoot through but merely require a holde until they can fully ignite, rockets allow an infantryman to supply hi own artillery support, especially against tanks. By the end of the \\ va > American rockets were delivered for use in individual, disposable pl aSt launchers which were thrown away after the rocket inside had nee fired. The great disadvantages of rockets were their inaccuracy and sho range, both of which came from the weak and uneven burning or propellant. Great improvements were made in the study of propella 0 by the Germans, especially from the work of Hermann Oberth, W*J Dornberger, and Werner von Braun at Peenemunde Rocket Resear Institute on the Baltic Sea. These men, working on the basis of ear 1 studies by the American professor, Robert H. Goddard (A Method Reaching Extreme Altitudes, 1929), and by a Polish high school teaci in Russia, K. E. Ziolkovsky (1857-1935), greatly advanced rocketry during the war and developed the V-2, which devastated London a Antwerp from September 8, 1944 until the war's end. The English been expecting this attack, since a German test rocket had gone as in June 1944, and had exploded over Sweden. The pieces from it, v were handed over to the Allies, made it possible to reconstruct characteristics of the rocket, but left them in dread that it was being n back until the Germans could perfect an atomic-bomb warhead, r this point of view, the first V-2 on England at 6:43 P.M., Septenibe 1944, followed by another, sixteen seconds later, was a relief: they ried warheads of conventional explosives. But that warhead or i> . pounds came in on a 46-foot rocket traveling at three times the spee sound, coming down from an altitude of 60 miles from a launching 200 miles away. More than 1,100 of these rockets killed 3,000 Bntis fore they were stopped. Just as a rocket reversed the recoil of a gun, directing it forwar 1 a shaped charge reversed the shape of the projectile. An artillery P r0 ' „ tile is bullet-shaped, with its forward end pointed or convex. In ' C. E. Munroe had shown that if the explosive charge were made cave, with the cavitv at its forward end against the target, the expi° force would be directed forward toward the target (as rays of S ^ forward from a concave headlight cavity) instead of backward. American bazooka of 1942 combined this shaped charge with a ro to provide an infantry weapon with which a single man could knoc a tank. A relatively small charge carried to a tank with an impeW greater than a well-hit baseball exploded most of its power forward 1"},{"pageNumber":862,"pageContent":"THE NEW AGE   847   narrow pencil of expl osive force which sometimes penetrated six inches Qi armor or six feet of masonry. A hole less than an inch wide on a tank could destroy its crew by spraying them with molten metal forced mward from the shaped charge. In a few cases, this occurred through ei ght-iiich armor without the armor being fully penetrated. Thus the tank, triumphant in 1940, was brought under control, and by 1945 was used largely as mobile artillerv. An even more remarkable advance was the proximity fuse. This was a Us e containing a tiny radar set which measured the distance to the target and could be adjusted to explode at a fixed distance. First used to ex plode A.A. shells within lethal distance of enemy planes, it soon was adapted to explode just over the heads of ground forces. The latter use, owever, was not permitted for more than two years, for fear the enemy Would obtain a dud and be able to copy it.

At that time (1940) all scientists knew that some of the heavier elements naturally disintegrated and were reduced to somewhat lighter elements by radioactive emission of nega- tively charged electrons or of positively charged alpha particles (helium nuclei, consisting of two positively charged protons with two uncharged neutrons). As early as 1934, in Rome, Enrico Fermi (Nobel Prize, 1938) and tmilio Segre (Nobel Prize, 1959), without realizing what they had done, had split uranium atoms into lighter elements (chiefly barium a nd krypton) by shooting neutrons into the uranium nucleus. (Such neu- rons had been isolated and identified in 1932, by Sir James Chadwick, Nobel Prize winner in 1935.) Although Ida Noddack at once suggested that Fermi had split the atom, the suggestion was generally ignored un- til Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, and Fritz Strassmann in Germany, in 1937- '939* repeated Fermi's experiments and sought to identify the bewilder- ln g assortment of lighter radioactive elements which emerged when uranium was bombarded with a stream of neutrons. \"y February 1939, it was established that the heaviest element, 92 uranium, could be split in various ways into lighter elements nearer the middle of the atomic table and that large amounts of energy were re- eased in the process. For example, 92 uranium might be split into 56 atium and 36 krypton. The reason for the release of energy was that the uclear particles (protons and neutrons) had smaller masses in the nucleus °r elements near the middle of the atomic table than they had in the nuclei of elements nearer the top or the bottom of the table or than le particles had alone outside any nucleus. This meant that the nuclear Particles had the least mass in the elements near 26 iron and that energy v °uld be released if heavier elements could be broken into lighter ones nearer iron or if lighter elements could be built up into heavier elements earer iron. Now that scientists can do both of these things, at least at \"*e very top (hydrogen) and the very bottom (uranium) of the table, w e call the splitting process \"fission\" and the building-up process \"fu- 10 n of nuclei. As explosive forces, they are now represented by the atomic\" bomb and the \"hydrogen,\" thermonuclear, bomb. The amount 0 energy released by either process can be calculated by Einstein's equa- lQ n, E =r mc-, where c is the speed of light (30 billion centimeters, or al) out 186,000 miles a second). Bv this equation, if only an ounce of mat- er is destroyed, 5,600,000 kilowatt hours of energy would be released. 11 J 939' of course, no one could conceive how lighter elements could be Used into heavier ones, as scientists had just revealed uranium could be nssured. To the historian of these events, the months of January and February '939 are of crucial significance. On January 2nd, Fermi, self-exiled from"},{"pageNumber":865,"pageContent":"850  TRAGEDY AND HOPE Mussolini's Italy, reached New York with his wife and children, from Stockholm, where he had just received the Nobel Prize. Four days later the Hahn-Strassmann report on uranium fission was published in Germany, and Otto Frisch, sent by his aunt, Lise Meitner, from Sweden (where they were both refugees from Hitler's Germany), dashed to Copenhagen to confer with Bohr on the real meaning of Hahn's report. Bohr left the next day, January 7th, to join Einstein at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, while Frisch and Meitner, in Sweden, repeated Hahn's fis- sure of uranium and reported on the results in quantitative terms, in the English journal Nature on February t,i and 18, 1939. These reports, which first used the word \"fission,\" introduced the \"Atomic Age,\" and showed that, weight for weight, uranium fission would be twenty nn • lion times more explosive than TNT. Such a burst of energy would, of course, not be noticed in nature 1 only a few atoms of uranium split; moreover, no large number woul split unless the uranium was so pure that its atoms were massed together and unless the stream of splitting neutrons continued to hit their nuclei- Immediately, in February 1939, a number of scientists thought that these two conditions, which do not exist in nature, might be created in tn laboratory. It took only a few minutes to realize that this process WO 1 \" become an almost instantaneous chain reaction if extra neutrons, to sen as fission bullets, were issued by the splitting process. Since the uraniui nucleus has 146 neutrons, while barium and krypton together have on 3 82 plus 47, or 129, it is obvious that each split uranium atom must re lease 17 neutrons capable of splitting other uranium atoms if they their nuclei with the right momentum. This idea was tested at once by Frederic Joliot-Curie (Nobel Pnz ' 1935) in Paris, and by Fermi and another refugee, Leo Szilard, with tne associates, at Columbia University, New York. The three teams submitte their reports to publication in March 1939. Bohr and others had alrea ) suggested that large-scale uranium fission does not occur in nature becau natural uranium was widely dispersed atomically by being overwhelming. diluted in chemical combination and mixture w ith other substances » its ores; they pointed out also that even pure natural uranium WP probably not explode because it was a mixture of three different km BE isotopes, of uranium, all with the same atomic number 92 ( a!1 \" c . , with the same chemical reactions, since these are based on the electr > charge of the nucleus as a whole) but with quite different ato weights of 234, 235, and 238. These isotopes could not be separated ; chemical means, since their identical atomic numbers (or nuclear elect cal charges) meant that thev had the same chemical reactions in join g to form different compounds. They could be separated only by phy methods based on their slightly different mass weights.  ,1  As uranium is extracted only with great difficulty, and m s"},{"pageNumber":866,"pageContent":"THE NEW AGE  85 I amounts, from its ores, 99.28 percent of it is U-238, 0.71 percent of it is 2 35> and only a trace is U-234. Thus, natural uranium has 140 times as m uch U-238 as U-235. It was soon discovered that U-235 was split by s o\\v or very fast neutrons, but, when it split, it emitted very energetic eutrons traveling at high speeds. These fast neutrons would have to be s owed down to split any more U-235, but since U-238 gobbles up all e utrons which come by at intermediate speeds, chain-reaction fission in ranium cannot occur in nature, where each atom of U-235 ls surrounded y atoms of U-238 as well as by other neutron-absorbing impurities. . rom this it was clear that a chain reaction could be continued in er °f two cases: (1) if very pure natural uranium could be mixed with substance (called a \"moderator\") which would slow down neutrons •tnout absorbing them or (2) if a mass of U-235 alone could be ob- med so large that the fast neutrons emitted by fission would slow down splitting speed before they escaped from the mass. The former reac- on could probably be controlled, but the latter mass of U-235 would 0st certainly explode spontaneously, since there are always a few slow utrons floating around in space to start the chain reaction. Even in 939 scientists guessed that ordinary water, heavy water (made of hydro- o n With a nucleus of a neutron and a proton instead of onlv one pro- ton \\     '     )i or carbon would make good moderators for a controlled reaction. e V also knew at least four ways in which, by physical methods, U-235 could be separated from U-238. ^t the very end of 1939, scientists had worked out what happened en U-238 gobbled up intermediate speed neutrons.

This would give a new transuraniac element number 94 n mass of 239. This second transuraniac element was called plutonium, 1 symbol 94 Pu-239. At the very end of 1939 theory seemed to indi- e that this plutonium, like U-235, would be fissured by slow neutrons, , ' sufficiently large lump of it could be made.

At that time, in the space of the months April to June, several things happened: (1) the Iw» overran Denmark and Norwav, capturing Bohr in one country and the world's only heavv-water factorv in the other country; (2) news reached America that the Nazis had forbidden all further sales of Czechoslovakia s uranium ores and had taken over the greater part of Germany's major physical research laboratory, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, f° r uranium research; (3) a blanket of secrecy was dropped throughout the world on scientific research on nuclear fission; and (4) the Nazis over- ran the Netherlands, Belgium, and France, capturing, among otheis, Joliot-Curie. At that time uranium was a largely worthless commodity of which a few tons a year was used for coloring ceramics; it was p r0 \" duced only incidentally as a byproduct of efforts to produce othe minerals such as cobalt or radium. Just before war began, Edgar Sengiet- managing director of Union Miniere of Katanga, Belgian Congo, learne from Joliot-Curie his discoverv of chain fission of Uranium-235. Accord- ingly, after the fall of France. Sengier ordered all available uranium ore, 1.250 tons of it, shipped to New York. This ore was 65 percent uranium oxide, compared to marketable North American ores of 0.2 percent, an the full-scale postwar exploitation of South African ores of .03 percen • For more than two years Sengier could find no one in the United State interested in his ores, which lay in a warehouse on Staten Island unt the end of 1942. Just before the curtain of secrecy on atomic research fell in the spring of 1940, astounding information on the subject was published in Sovie Russia, but, like most Russian-language publications, was ignored in t outer world. In 1939 the Soviet Academy of Sciences set up, under t chairmanship of V. I. Vernadsky, director and founder (1922) of the Len ingrad Radium Institute, an \"Isotopes Committee\" to work on tj separation of uranium isotopes and the production of heavy water, first cyclotron in Europe, an atom smasher of four million electron vo (4 MeV) which had been operational since 1937, went into full exp er mental use in April 1940, and, at the same time, the Academy of S cien £ ordered immediate construction of a cyclotron of 11 MeV, compara to the world's largest, the 60-inch cyclotron at the University of ^ a fornia, operated by Ernest O. Lawrence, the inventor of these macnin (Nobel Prize, 1939). In this same fatal spring of 1940, a conference on isotope separation Moscow publicly discussed the problem of separation of U-235; sU quently, Y. B. Khariton and Y. B.

No one, unfortunately, did wish to see. About the same time, Edwin A. McMillan (Nobel Prize, '95') and Philip H. Abelson, using E. O. Lawrence's great cyclotron at Berkeley, California, had studied the results arising from neutron bom- ardment of Uranium-238, and indicated the nature of 93 neptunium and \" e fissionable possibilities of 94 plutonium (Physical Review, June 15, '94°)• Bohr, as well as Louis A. Turner of Princeton, had already indi- cated some of the characteristics, including fissionability, of plutonium. I he Soviet position in atomic research in 1940 is astonishing in view the depredations inflicted on Soviet scientists by Stalin in the purges ° '937-1939- In June 1940, Soviet science in this subject was about on a evel with that of the German scientists who remained in Nazi Germany, though both were far behind the refugee scientists who were still malc- § their ways westward to the English-speaking world. The Soviet dentists were, apparently, interested in atomic research only for indus- la l power purposes, and were not much concerned with achieving °mic explosives. Accordingly, they concentrated on atomic piles of \"iixed uranium isotopes, rather than on uranium separation, and most of e 'r work was suspended after the Nazi invasion in 1941. In a similar ' a V the remaining German scientists, although seeking the bomb, de- Wed in February 1942 that large-scale separation of isotopes was too pensive to be practical, and spent the rest of the war years on the °peless task of trying to devise an atomic pile which could be used as bomb. The great German error was their failure to reach the concep- l0 n of \"critical mass,\" the point which had been published in Russia ln 1940. in the United States and Britain the impact of the events of 1940 was , Uc h more intense among the refugee scientists than among the Amer- 3ns.

Only on December 6, 1941, the day before"},{"pageNumber":869,"pageContent":"854  TRAGEDY AND HOPE Pearl Harbor, was the decision taken to make an all-out effort to unlock atomic energy. When the curtain of secrecy fell in June 1940, all the theory needed for the task was known by all capable physicists; what was not known was (1) that their theories would work, and (2) how the immense re- sources needed for the task could be mobilized. As late as 1939, less t' ian an ounce of uranium metal had ever been made in the United States. Now it was necessary to make tons of it in extremely refined form- 10 build an atomic pile for a controlled nuclear reaction, hundreds of ton of heavy water or of graphite refined to a degree hitherto unknown wtf also needed. This task, entrusted to the direction of Arthur H. Compt° n (Nobel Prize, 1927), with Fermi doing the actual work, was set up 3t the University of Chicago. The pile of purified graphite with lumps 0 uranium all through it was built in a squash court under the West Stan of Stagg Field, where football had been discontinued. The pile of gr a P \" ite, shaped as a roughly flattened sphere about 24 feet in diameter, ha 12,400 pounds of uranium in small scattered lumps distributed in a cu at its center. Neutron counters, thermometers, and other instrumen kept track of the fission rate going on inside it. Before the top l a V e could be added, these indicators began to rise increasingly rapidly danger levels; therefore rods of cadmium steel were inserted through t graphite lattice. Cadmium, which absorbs large quantities of neutro without being changed, could be used to hold back the fission proce until the pile was finished. On December 2, 1942, before a team of scie tists, these cadmium rods were slowly withdrawn to the point where chain nuclear reaction took off. It could be damped down or speeded up to explosive level simply by pushing the rods in or pulling them oU ' This first sustained nuclear reactor was a great success, but it contribute little toward an atom bomb. Within it, at full operation, plutonium wa made at a rate which would require 70,000 years to obtain enough to bomb. This pile operated on purified natural uranium in which the V--i was 140 times the U-235. To separate U-235 from U-238 by physical methods, four techmqu were attempted on parallel paths. Two of these ceased to be signirica after the end of 1943. The two survivors were gas diffusion and electr magnetic separation. In the latter, gaseous compounds of uranium w r e electrically charged so that they would move along a vacuum tube a pass through a powerful magnet which made them swerve. The heav U-238 compounds would swerve less than the slightly lighter U- 2 3:> compounds, and the two could be separated. Using the gigantic n cyclotron magnet at the University of California, which was 184 1IlC across, Ernest O. Lawrence and Emilio Segre showed that it would quire about 45,000 such units to separate a pound of U-235 a •' ^ 1, The electromagnetic separator plant (called Y-12) as set up at"},{"pageNumber":870,"pageContent":"THE NEW AGE  855  Ridge in 1943 covered 825 acres and was housed in 8 large buildings (two 01 which were 543 feet by 312 feet). Several thousand magnets, most ot which were 20 feet by 20 feet by 2 feet, consumed astronomical quantities of electricity in separating uranium isotopes into gigantic tanks. \" e se tanks, weighing fourteen tons each, were pulled out of line by as Uc h as three inches by the magnetic attractions created, straining the P'pes carrying uranium compound, and eventually they had to be as tened to the floor. Since copper for electrical connections was in such lor t supply, 14,000 tons of silver from the Treasury reserve of Ameri- an paper money was secretly taken from the Treasury vaults (although \"l carried publiclv on the Treasury balance sheets) and made into 'Wing for the Y-12 plant. From this plant came much of the U-235 used m the Hiroshima A-bomb. 1 he gaseous-diffusion method, which had been carried fairly far by e British before America took it over, took advantage of the fact that 0rr is of lighter U-235 g as move more rapidly than the heavier U-238 u thus pass more rapidly through a porous barrier.

B y the end of April 1943, in three adjacent valleys near Oak Ridge, e nnessee, three plants were under construction for gaseous diffusion \" e lectromagnetic separation of U-235 and for a large uranium pile to a ke plutonium out of U-238. By the end of the war, Oak Ridge, cov- ing 70 square miles, had a population of 78,000 persons and was the fifth r g e st community in Tennessee. Because the plutonium plant was so dan- b tous, owing to its enormous generation of heat and radioactivity, a lar ger and more isolated plant was begun on a tract of 670 square miles ear Hanford, Washington. A construction camp of 60,000 workers was , U P there in April 1943; construction of the first fission pile was begun June; and it began to operate in January 1945.

This obsession was based on belief that the project involved fundamental scientific secrets (t\" e were no such secrets). His efforts were quite in vain, as the only r secrets, the technological ones regarding isotope separation, criti mass, and trigger mechanisms of the bombs, were revealed to the 50 Union, almost as soon as they were achieved, by British scientists, secrecy, thus, was secrecy for the American public rather than for Germans or the Russians (neither of whom were actually seeking information, since, like General Groves himself, they had little fait\" the feasibility of the project).   ,    For security reasons General Groves \"compartmentalized\" the wo and allowed only about a dozen persons to see the project as a wn Consequently, the vast majority of those working on the project w not allowed to know what they were really doing or why, and this < of perspective greatly delayed the solution of problems.

These activities significantly delayed American achievemen the atom bomb without achieving their ostensible purpose, since ther no evidence either that the three enemy Powers could have made bomb or that Russia's making of the bomb was significantly delaye General Groves's extreme degree of secrecy.

I myself heard General Groves make these statements in °45- On the other hand, General Groves was a tireless and driving man- ger and an expert manipulator of the personal, political, and military arrangements which made the bomb possible, in the last two years of the project (July 1943-July 1945), it passed rough crisis after crisis in a frenzied sequence which made it appear, er 7 alternative month, that it would be a $2 billion fiasco. In January 944> when the enormous gaseous-diffusion plant at Oak Ridge was un- er full construction but without the diffusion barriers, since no effective es could be made, it became necessary to junk the barriers on which s had been made for almost two years and to turn to mass production rnulions of square feet of a new barrier which had scarcely been ed. When this plant began to operate, section by section, at the end the year, it worked so ineffectively that it seemed almost impossible at the concentration of U-235 could ever be raised over 15 or 20 per- ^t without the construction of miles of additional barrier which would a > r the bomb by months and use up fantastic quantities of uranium x anuoride gas just to fill the chambers. Similarly, the electromagnetic parator plants suffered breakdown after breakdown, and operated at ev el which made it seem impossible to raise the U-235 content over 50 Percent. v April 1944, ^ seemed clear that 95 percent U-235 could not be ained before 1946 even if the gas-diffusion and electromagnetic plants re run in series instead of parallel, with the latter starting off with 20 c ent U-235 from the former instead of both trying to process natural anium from scratch. At that point, Oppenheimer discovered that Philip son (who had originally discovered how to make uranium hexa- j, ^ a ^ Deen working for the navy, trying to make enriched U-235 e used to propel a nuclear submarine. He was using thermal separa- n i one of the two methods (the other was centrifuge) that the Man- an District had rejected in 1942. Thermal separation was based on the that a liquid mixture in a container with a hot wall and an opposite wall will tend to separate; the heavier liquid will tend to accumulate r the cold wall, will cool, and sink, while the lighter liquid will tend gather near the hot wall, get warmer, and rise. Abelson, who knew ln g of the work of the iManhattan District, or of the successful ear pile at Chicago, was working at the Philadelphia Navy Yard ,. ne had 102 vertical, double concentric pipes, each 48 feet long, in lc h the inner pipe was heated by steam, the outer pipe was kept cool,"},{"pageNumber":873,"pageContent":"858  TRAGEDY AND HOPE and the ring-shaped space between the two was filled with a urani liquid mixture whose two isotopes tended to separate from each ot From the top of these pipes he hoped to be able to draw one-fifth ou a day of 5 percent U-235 by July 1, 1944. Groves grasped at this straw, and on June 27, 1944 signed a contr for a thermal-diffusion plant at Oak Ridge to be ready in ninety da\\ • The new plant, which eventually cost over $15 million, was 522 long, 82 feet wide, and 75 feet high, and was to contain twenty-one exa copies of Abelson's plant (2,142 tubes in all); it would yield U-235 riched to a few percentage points to be fed into the inadequate g diffusion plant. It began to produce in March 1945. By placing the t separation methods in sequence and working night and day to imp the efficiency of all three, it began to look as if U-235 for one might be available in the second half of 1945. These disappointments with U-235 naturally turned men's hopes the plutonium being made at Hanford. When the first giant pile \"critical\" there on September 27, 1944, it shut itself down after a J and then restarted itself again after another day. Frenzied study consultation with the smaller piles at Oak Ridge and at Chicago J revealed the unexpected production, within the pile, of a neutron-a s ing isotope, Xenon 135, with a half-life of 9 hours; the pile started 1 again when this decayed, and thus stopped draining neutrons from uranium fission process. This problem was eventually solved by g r increasing the uranium tubes in the pile.   , . £ All through this worry, Los Alamos was having problems wit 1 trigger mechanisms. Experiment and calculations eventually showe ^ the critical mass of U-235 was less than 11 pounds, about the size small grapefruit, if it were properly compressed and in spherical s Y To achieve this, two mechanisms were conceived, known as the g and \"implosion.\" The \"gun\" was designed to create a critical *f*A shooting a lump of U-235 at high velocity into a subcritical mass so the combination would be over the critical mass. The resulting s Y however, was so unspherical that it was calculated that the amount of U-235 necessary for the gun trigger bomb would be a twice the ideal critical mass. This increase from about 11 to abo pounds of U-235 per bomb would extend the date on which the was ready by weeks, since the output of U-235 was so small. The second trigger, called \"implosion,\" planned to make a sphere of U-235 or plutonium which was critical in total arnou ^ kept subcritical by the hole in the center. This metallic sphere 'v be crushed together into the space in its center to make a critica there by the explosion of twenty or more crescent-shaped pieces o which surrounded the sphere. The difficulty was that all the surrou TNT had to explode at the same instant in order to ram the n"},{"pageNumber":874,"pageContent":"THE NEW AGE   859   Material together at the center; anv lag would simply bulge the nuclear Material erratically and prevent the achievement of critical mass. All he ordnance experts, including Captain Parsons, of the United States av y, in charge of this part of the work at Los Alamos, were con- '^ced that such accurate timing of TNT explosion, with two dozen pieces exploded within a millionth of a second, would be impossible. 1 his brought up another crisis because Glenn Seaborg (Nobel Prize, '95i) and Segre predicted and then demonstrated that the Plutonium-238 . c h they were seeking from the Hanford piles spontaneously changed ^\"J at a slow rate, into its isotope Plutonium-240. Since Pu-240 was a spontaneous fissioner, this impurity would prematurely explode the r get mass of plutonium in the gun-type trigger, since the inefficiency the gun mechanism made it necessary to have the target mass so large .'perfectly safe with U-235, but suicide with Pu-238 if there was Pu-240 •t also). The plutonium, therefore, had to be used with an implosion 'gger, and, if that could not be devised, the $400 million cost of the ar \"ord plant had been practicallv thrown away. ortunately, George Kistiakowskv, chemistry professor from Harvard a a great authority on explosives, came to Los Alamos, and by the P rin g of 1945 had worked out an ignition by which all the TNT °uld explode within a few millionths of a second. This saved the pluto- um scheme, but it was clear that this material would hardly be avail- e m a bomb amount until late summer of 1945 and that there would ot be enough to test the implosion trigger on it, if it were to be used in the w ar B .V July 1945, everyone concerned with the bomb was working around T\" 1 \" l0( -% and a few had begun to fear that the war would be over be- e the bomb would be ready. On the other hand, a group of the scien- .'' ec * by Szilard who had instigated the project, were beginning to s ate that the bomb should not be used against Japan. Their motives e been questioned since, but were both simple and honorable. They pressed for the atom bomb in 1939 because they feared that Ger- _ > r was working on one and might get it first. Once the defeat of niany ended that danger, many scientists regarded continued work e bomb as immoral and no longer defensive (since there was no tli CE °^ J a P an ' s developing one).

These stories have been spread largely by partisan conservative and Right-wing neo-isolationists, by the periodical press and other ente - tainment media who make money out of sensationalism, and by f publicity agencies of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (whose cri1 purpose, for more than a quarter-century, has been to depict J- tag' Hoover as the chief, if not the sole, defense of our country against su version). An early and fairly typical example of these efforts was a semidoc - mentary film called the House on p2?id Street, which was made by L° u de Rochemont, in collaboration with the FBI, and was widely and favo ably viewed by the American people in 1946. It showed that the before the war, had infiltrated the Nazi espionage network in this cou try and successfully frustrated its large-scale efforts to communicate Germany atomic secrets which it had obtained from an employee in atomic plant under military control. At the end of the picture the co. mentator's voice announced that the efforts of the FBI had successtu frustrated all efforts by foreign agents to penetrate our atomic sec during the war, and would continue to do so.

Harding, and by various government agencies, such as the FBI and the air force, who could use such stories to obtain mcreased appropriations from the Congress. Some of the details of these str uggles will be mentioned later. When we speak of atomic secrets and spying, we must distinguish ntee quite different types of information: (i) scientific principles, (2) questions of general production tactics (such as, which methods are Workable or unworkable), and (3) detailed information of engineering instruction. No secrets of Group 1 existed; and secrets of Group 3 v °uld usually have required elaborate blueprints and formulas which °uld not be passed by spying methods of communication. There re- air \"s information of Group 2, which could be extremely helpful in v mg wasted time and effort. In most cases information of this type '°uld have little meaning to anyone without a minimum of scientific fining. This kind of information, so far as present information allows judgment, would seem to have been passed to the Russians from two n ghsh scientists, Alan Nunn May and Klaus Fuchs, and an American rmy enlisted man, David Greenglass, in the period to September 1945. u 'in May had little directly to do with the A-bomb, but he had worked me heavy-water nuclear pile in Canada and had visited the graphite r e in Chicago several times. He gave Soviet agents Lieutenant Angelov d Colonel Zabotin, in Canada, considerable information about atomic r e s, as well as the daily output of U-235 and plutonium at Oak Ridge Woo and 800 grams, respectively), and handed over a trace of the Ur aniu m isotope U-233. Ihe information from Fuchs, which was much more valuable, cul- nated about the same period (June 1945) and gave information on o seous diffusion, the two trigger devices, and the fact that work had e n done without much success toward a fusion H-bomb. Greenglass, at same time, gave the same Russian contact, Harry Gold, a rough etch of part of the \"implosion trigger\" for the A-bomb. There may , * Dee n other spying episodes of which we are not now aware, but information passed to the Russians of which we are now aware prob- y did not contribute much significant aid to their achievement of the °mb. The H-bomb will be considered later. Statements frequently e that the Russians could not have made the A-bomb without infor- i°n obtained from espionage, or statements that such information t~ e oed up their acquisition of the bomb by years (or even by eighteen nths) are most unlikely, although here again we cannot be sure. They l have been saved from trying some unremunerative lines of en- ~ 0r i but the real problems in making the bomb were engineering and ai problems, which Russia could overcome, on a crash basis, once it known that we had such a bomb. This knowledge was given to the nd by the destruction of Hiroshima."},{"pageNumber":877,"pageContent":"862 TRAGEDY AND HOPE The Twentieth-Century Pattern The decision to use the bomb against Japan marks one of the cri i turning points in the history of our times. We cannot now say that world would have been better, but we can surely say that it would been different. We can also say, with complete assurance, that no involved in the decision had a complete or adequate picture of the uation. The scientists who were consulted had no information on status of the war itself, had no idea how close to the end Japan alrea j was, and had no experience to make judgments on this matter. The p° cians and military men had no real conception of the nature of the weapon or of the drastic revolution it offered to human life. To the was simply a \"bigger bomb,\" even a \"much bigger bomb,\" and, by fact alone, they welcomed it.   .    Some people, like General Groves, wanted it to be used to justn) $2 billion they had spent. A large group sided with him because Democratic leaders in the Congress had authorized these expend' outside proper congressional procedures and had cooperated in keep them from almost all members of both houses by concealing them u misleading appropriation headings. Majority Leader John W. ^' c ^ mack (later Speaker) once told me, half joking, that if the bomb not worked he expected to face penal charges. Some Republicans, ably Congressman Albert J. Engel of Michigan, had already shown s g of a desire to use congressional investigations and newspaper p uD to raise questions about misuse of public funds. During one War Dep< ment discussion of this problem, a skilled engineer, Jack Madigan, s \"If the project succeeds, there won't be any investigation.

But General Norstad declared at Washington that this ockading action was a cowardly proceeding unworthy of the Air or ce. It was therefore discontinued.\" tven now it is impossible to make any final and impartial judgment of e merits of this decision. The degree to which it has since been dis- f ted for partisan purposes mav be seen from the contradictory charges at the efforts to get a bomb slowed down after the defeat of Germany nd the opposite charge that they speeded up in that period. The former ar ge, aimed at the scientists, especially the refugees at Chicago who . ad given America the bomb by providing the original impetus toward ' M ' as that these scientists, led by Szilard, were anti-Nazi, pro-Soviet, _ 0 un-American, and worked desperately for the bomb so long as 'tier was a threat, but on his demise opposed all further work for fear Would make the United States too strong against the Soviet Union. He opposite charge was that the Manhattan District worked with in- easing frenzy after Germany's defeat, because General Groves was •-Soviet. A variant of this last charge is that Groves was a racist and as willing to use the bomb on nonwhites like the Japanese but un- 1 ling to use it against the Germans. It is true that Groves in his report A P r il 23, 1945, which was presented to President Truman by Secre- !*y Stimson two days later, said that Japan had always been the target. . e Word \"always\" here probably goes back only to the date on which w as realized that the bomb would be so heavy that it could not be ndled by any American plane in the European theater and, if used er e, would have to be dropped from a British Lancaster, while in the Pacific the B-29 could handle it. t seems clear that no one involved in making the decision in 1945 a u any adequate picture of the situation. The original decision to make . e bomb had been a correct one based on fear that Germany would get it f\\        .        nrs t. On this basis the project might have been stopped as soon as it as clear that Germany was defeated without it. By that time other rc es had come into the situation, forces too powerful to stop the reject. It is equally clear that the defeat of Japan did not require the •bomb, just as it did not require Russian entry into the war or an . mer ican invasion of the Japanese home islands. But, again, other factors v 'olving interests and nonrational considerations were too powerful, j^owever, if the United States had not finished the bomb project or ad not used it, it seems most unlikely that the Soviet Union would a ^ made its postwar efforts to get the bomb. There are several reasons for this: (1) the bomb's true significance ,' as ev en more remote from Soviet political and military leaders than r °m our own, and would have been too remote to make the effort to get"},{"pageNumber":879,"pageContent":"864  TRAGEDY AND HOPE it worthwhile if the bomb had never been demonstrated; (2) Soviet strategy had no interest in strategic bombing, and their final decision to make the bomb, based on our possession of it, involved changes in strate- gic ideas, and the effort, almost from scratch, to obtain a strategic bombing plane (the T11-4) able to carry it; and (3) the strain on Soviet economic resources from making the bomb was very large, in view 0 the Russian war damage. Without the knowledge of the actual boniD which the Russian leaders obtained from our demonstration of its power, they would almost certainly not have made the effort to get the bom if we had not used it on Japan. On the other hand, if we had not used the bomb on Japan, we wbtll have been quite incapable of preventing the Soviet ground forces rr° n expanding wherever they were ordered in Eurasia in 1946 and later. VV do not know where they might have been ordered because we do n know if the Kremlin is insatiable for conquest, as some \"experts\" claw 1 * or is only seeking buffer security zones, as other \"experts\" believe, o it is clear that Soviet orders to advance were prevented by Ame riC * possession of the A-bomb after 1945. It does seem clear that ultimate) Soviet forces would have taken all of Germany, much of the Balkan, probably Manchuria, and possibly other fringe areas across central Asi< - including Iran. Such an advance of Soviet power to the Rhine, t Adriatic, and the Aegean would have been totally unacceptable to t United States, but, without the atom bomb, we could hardly naV stopped it. Moreover, such an advance would have led to Commtfni- or Communist-dominated coalition governments in Italy and France. the Soviet forces had advanced to the Persian Gulf across Iran, t 1 might have led to such Communist-elected governments in India ai much of Africa. From these considerations it seems likely that American suspense of the atomic project after the defeat of Germany or failure to the bomb against Japan would have led eventually to American posse sion of the bomb in an otherwise intolerable position of inferiority Russia or even to war in order to avoid such a position (but with lit hope, from war, to avoid such inferiority). This would have occur even if we assume the more optimistic of two assumptions about Russ • (1) that they would not themselves proceed to make the bomb and K z > that they are not themselves insatiably expansionist. On the whole, tn it seems that the stalemate of mutual nuclear terror without war in wni the world now exists is preferable to what might have occurred 1* United States had made the decision either to suspend the atomic pr°l after the defeat of Germany or to refuse to use it on Japan.

But it must be clearly recognized that the particular stalemate of nuclear terror in which the world now lives derives directly from the two decisions made in 1945 to continue the project after the defeat of Germany and to use the bomb on Japan. This nuclear stalemate, in turn, leads to pervasive consequences in all aspects of the world in the twentieth century. It gives rise to a frenzied r ace between the two super-Powers to outstrip each other in the appli- cation of science and rationality to life, beginning with weapons. This effort provides such expensive equipment and requires such skill from the operators of this equipment that it makes obsolete the army of temporarily drafted citizen-soldiers of the nineteenth century and of the armed hordes\" of World War I and even of World War II, and requires the use of highly trained, professional, mercenary fighting men. The growth of the army of specialists, foretold by General de Gaulle ln '934 an d foreseen by others, destrovs one of the three basic foundations °t political democracy. These three bases are (1) that men are relatively equal in factual power; (2) that men have relatively equal access to the \"formation needed to make a government's decisions; and (3) that men »ave a psychological readiness to accept majority rule in return for hose civil rights which will allow any minority to work to build itself U P to become a majority. Just as weapons development has destroyed the first of these bases, 0 secrecy, security considerations, and the growing complexity of the lss ues have served to undermine the second of these. The third, which Was always the weakest of the three, is still in the stage of relative vitality and relative acceptability that it had in the nineteenth century, ut is in much greater danger from the threat of outside forces, notably ne changes in the other two bases, plus the greater danger today from • ternal war or from domestic economic breakdown. One great danger in regard to the second of these basic foundations \\availability of information necessary for decision-making) is the impact u P°n it of the expansion of rationalization. While this has led to auto- at ic and mechanical storage and retrieval of information, it has also led efforts to establish automatic electronic decision-making on the basis the growing volume and complexity of such information. This renun- ation of the basic \"feature of being human—judgment and decision- aking—i s ver y dangerous and is a renunciation of the very faculty llc h gave man his success in the evolutionary struggle with other living eatures. If this whole process of human evolution is now to be aban- ne d in favor of some other, unconscious and mechanical, method of ecision-making, in which the individual's flexibility and awareness are °e subordinated to a rigid group process, then man must yield to those orr ns of life, such as the social insects, which have already carried this ethod to a high degree of perfection."},{"pageNumber":881,"pageContent":"866  TRAGEDY AND HOPE This whole process has been made the central focus of a recent novel, Fail-Safe, by Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler. The reduction of men to automatons in a complicated nexus of expensive machines is well shown in that book. To its picture must be added two points: (i) It does not require a blown condenser, as in the book, to unleash the full dan- gers of the situation; it is a situation which is dangerous in itself even u it functions perfectly; and (2) the avoidance of the ultimate total catas- trophe in the book, because a few men, at and near the top, were able to resume the human functions of decision, self-sacrifice, love of their fellowmen, and hope for the future, should not conceal the fact that the whole world in that story came within minutes of handing its resources over to the insects. Regardless of the outcome of the situation, it is increasingly clear that, in the twentieth century, the expert will replace the industrial tycoon in control of the economic system even as he will replace the democratic voter in control of the political system. This is because pl an \" ning will inevitably replace laissez faire in the relationships between the two systems. This planning may not be single or unified, but it win be planning, in which the main framework and operational forces of the system will be established and limited by the experts on the govern- mental side; then the experts within the big units on the economic side will do their planning within these established limitations.

But, in general, his freedom and choice will be controlled within very narrow alternatives by the fact that he will be numbered from but and followed, as a number, through his educational training, his require military or other public service, his tax contributions, his health an medical requirements, and his final retirement and death benefits. Eventually, in two or three generations, as the ordinary individual wh is not an expert or a skilled professional soldier or a prominent industria executive becomes of less personal concern to the government, his co tacts with the government will become less direct and will take p'a increasingly through intermediaries. Some movement in this directio may be seen already in those cases where taxpayers whose incomes a entirely from wages or salaries find that their whole tax is already p^ by their employer or in the decreasing need for the military draftee to called to serve by a letter from the President. The development of suen situation, a kind of neofeudalism, in which the relationships of ot nary people to government cease to be direct and are increasing; through intermediaries (who are private rather than public autno ties), is a long way in the future."},{"pageNumber":882,"pageContent":"THE NEW AGE   867   One consequence of the nuclear rivalry has been the almost total destruction of international law and the international community as they existed from the middle of the seventeenth century to the end of the nineteenth. That old international law was based on a number of sharp rational distinctions which no longer exist; these include the distinction etween war and peace, the rights of neutrals, the distinction between combatants and noncombatants, the nature of the state, and the distinction between public and private authority. These are now either destroyed or ln great confusion. We have already seen the obliteration of the distinc- 'ons between combatants and noncombatants and between neutrals and belligerents brought on by British actions in World War I. These began with the blockade of neutrals, like the Netherlands, and the use of oating mines in navigational waters. The Germans retaliated with acts gainst Belgian civilians and with indiscriminate submarine warfare, nese kinds of actions continued in World War II with the British •ght-bombing effort aimed at destroying civilian morale by the de- action of workers' housing (Lord Cherwell's favorite tactic) and the American fire raids against Tokyo. It is generally stated in American accounts of the use of the first atom bomb that target planning was ased on selection of military targets, and it is not generally known Ven today that the official orders from Cabinet level on this matter Pecifically said \"military objectives surrounded by workers' housing.\" ne postwar balance of terror reached its peak of total disregard both noncombatants and of neutrals in the policies of John Foster Dulles, Vn o combined sanctimonious religion with \"massive retaliation wherever n< l whenever we judge fit\" to the complete destruction of any non- combatant or neutral status. Most other aspects of traditional international law have also been de- stro yed. The Cold War has left little to the old distinction between war and peace in which wars had to be formally declared and formally concluded. Hitler's attacks without warning; the Korean War, which Wa s not a \"war\" in international law or in American constitutional law (since it was not \"declared\" by Congress); and the fact that no peace tre aty has been signed with Germany to end World War II, while we are ready engaged in all kinds of undeclared warlike activities against the °viet Union, have combined to wipe out manv of the distinctions be- ^een war and peace which were so painfully established in the five ^ndred years before Grotius died (in 1645). Most of these losses are obvious but there are others, equally signifi- ant but not yet widely recognized. The growth of international law n me late medieval and Renaissance periods not only sought to make ne distinctions we have indicated, as a reaction against \"feudal dis- order\"; it also sought to make a sharp distinction between public and Private authority (in order to get rid of the feudal doctrine of doininia)"},{"pageNumber":883,"pageContent":"868  TRAGEDY AND HOPE and to set up sharp criteria of public authority involving the new doc- trine of sovereignty. One of the chief criteria of such sovereignty was ability to maintain the peace and to enforce both law and order over a definite territory; one of its greatest achievements was the elimination of arbitrary nonsovereign private powers such as robber barons on land or piracy on the sea. Under this conception, ability to maintain law and order became the chief evidence of sovereignty, and the possession of sovereignty became the sole mark of public authority and the existence of a state. All this has now been destroyed. The Stimson Doctrine of 1931, now carried to its extreme conclusion in the American refusal to recognize Red China, shifted recognition from the objective criterion of ability to maintain order to the subjective criterion of approval of the form of government or liking of a government's domestic behavior. The destruction of international law, like the destruction of inter- national order, has gone much further than this. As long as the chief criterion for a state's sovereignty, and hence of recognition, was ability to maintain order, states in international law were regarded as equal- This concept is still recognized in theory in such organizations as the Assembly of the United Nations. But the achievement of nuclear weap- ons, by creating two super-Powers in a Cold War, destroyed the fact of the equality of states. This had the obvious result of creating Powers on two levels: ordinary and super; but it had the less obvious, and more significant, consequence of permitting the existence of states of lower levels of power, far below the level of ordinary Powers. This arose be- cause the nuclear stalemate of the two super-Powers created an umbrella of fear of precipitating nuclear war which falsified their abilities to act at all. As a result, all kinds of groups and individuals could do all kinds of actions to destroy law and order without suffering the consequences or forcible retaliation by ordinary powers or by the super-Powers, a nd could become recognized as states when they were still totally lacking in the traditional attributes of statehood. For example, the Leopoldsviu e group were recognized as the real government of the whole Congo in spite of the fact that they were incapable of maintaining law a' 1 order over the area (or even in Leopoldsville itself). In a similar way a gang of rebels in Yemen in 1962 were instantly recognized before they gave any evidence whatever of ability to maintain control or of readiness to assume the existing international obligations of the Yemen state, a n before it was established that their claims to have killed the king w er *j true.

They can do this either by securing the intervention v sually secret) of some outside Power or even by preventing the'inter- e ntion of a recognized Power fearful of precipitating nuclear or lesser onrlict. In this way areas with a few states (such as southeast Asia) were attered into many; states went out of existence or appeared (as Syria ld m 1958 and 1961); and so-called new states came into existence by ores without reference to any traditional realities of political power or the established procedures of international law. the number of separate states registered as members in the United ations rose steadily from 51 in 1945 to 82 in 1958 to 104 in 1961, and °ntiriued to rise. The difference in power between the strongest and the e akest became astronomical, and the whole mechanism of international ations, outside the UN organization as well as within it, became more a more remote from power considerations or even from reality, and c ame enmeshed in subjective considerations of symbols, prestige, per- na ' pride, and petty spites. By 1963 single tribes in Africa were looking ^vard recognition of statehood through membership -in the UN even en they lacked the financial resources to support a delegation at UN a °,uarters in New York City or in the capitals of any major country were, indeed, incapable of controlling police forces to maintain f oer in their own tribal areas. n this way the existence of nuclear stalemate within the Cold War Tied on the total destruction of traditional international law and the s auual loss of meaning of the established concepts of state and public orit y, and opened the door to a feudalization of authority some- at similar to that which the founders of the modern state system and mternational law had sought to overcome in the period from the tth century to the seventeenth."},{"pageNumber":886,"pageContent":"XVII NUCLEAR RIVALRY AND THE COLD WAR: AMERICAN ATOMIC SUPREMACY, 1945-1950"},{"pageNumber":887,"pageContent":"The Factors The Origins of the Cold War, 1945-1949 The Crisis in China, 1945-1950 American Confusions, 1945-1950"},{"pageNumber":888,"pageContent":"The Factors H ISTORICALLY, the period 1945 to early 1963 forms a unity. During this period a number of factors interacted upon one an- other to present a very complicated and extraordinarily danger- Us series of events. That mankind and civilized life got through the period of almost two decades may be attributed to a number of lucky nances rather than to any particular skill among the two opposing polit- 1Ca ' blocs or among the neutrals. 1 he period as a whole is so complex that no successful effort has been ade by any historian to present it as a unity. Instead, it is usually eated as a series of separate, relatively isolated, developments, such as ,. ents in the Far East, United States domestic history, Soviet domestic st °ry, developments in science and technology, the rise of the neutrals, . d other developments. Such a presentation is not adequate because falsifies the historical fact that these (and other) developments oc- ri *ed simultaneously, and constantly reacted upon one another. More- er > the central fact of the whole period, and the one which dominated > . ot hers, was the scientific and technological rivalry between the •\"ted States and the Soviet Union, because this rivalry formed the r y foundation and core of the Cold War, which was recognized by ^ r >'one to be the dominant political factor of the period. ^fortunately, the Cold War is almost always described in terms lc h put minor emphasis on, or which may even neglect, the role of ^t-American technological rivalry. This is done because most his- !a ns do not feel competent to discuss it; but chiefly it is done because cn of the evidence is secret. Because of such secrecy, the story of this let -American technological rivalry falls into two quite distinct, and en contradictory, parts: (1) what the real situation was and (2) what eva 'ent public opinion believed the situation to be. For example, in 954-1955 the Soviet Union had a thermonuclear so-called H-bomb many • nt ' ls before we did, when public opinion believed the opposite; again, at e 1960 there was a widespread belief throughout the world in a so- 'missile gap,\" or American inferiority in nuclear missile weapons, e n no such inferiority existed; and finally, for a period of several 873"},{"pageNumber":889,"pageContent":"874  TRAGEDY AND HOPE years, from 1957 to about i960, the Russians were in advance of the United States and the free world generally in missile technology and in missile-guidance mechanisms, although this was not reflected, then or later, in any superiority in nuclear missile weapons, because of their simultaneous inferiority in nuclear warheads for missiles, an inferiority by a wide margin both in numbers and in variety of such explosive weapons. In dealing with this central factor of the world situation, the historian is prevented by secrecy on both sides from making any assured or final judgments, and must simply make a judicious estimate of the situation on the basis of available information. Unfortunately, the influence of this factor is so central, and thus so all-pervasive, that inability to be sure or the facts on this matter brings a fair amount of uncertainty into many other areas, such as, for example, the foreign policy of John Foster Dulles or the real significance of the so-called \"atomic espionage cases. Such uncertainty, however, is always present in historical analysis or the recent past, and most historians, knowing that the documents and thus the facts are unavailable for contemporary history (say, the last twenty years), usually leave the most recent past to others, to political scientists, journalists, or biographers. In the history of the period 1945-1963 there are six chief factors: the Cold War and the nuclear balance; (2) demobilization and reniobi- lization, with special emphasis on interservice rivalries and the pressures from industrial complexes; (3) partisan political struggles in the United States, centering on the rise and decline of unilateralism; (4) persona' political struggles in the Soviet Union, centering on the succession to Stalin; (5) intrabloc discords, centering on the relations between the United States and its allies on one side and the relations between the Soviet Union and its satellites on the other side; and (6) the role or neutralism, revolving around backward nationalisms and anticolonialisrn- The history of the period can be understood only in terms of the inter- play of these six factors, in all their complexities, treated simultaneously! but before we attempt to do this we must make a brief examination or each factor separately in order to define our terms and to estabhsn secondary chronological sequences. The Cold War, as we shall see in the next chapter, was an inevitable consequence of the defeats of Germany, Japan, France, and Italy, itt< \\ the collapse of Nationalist China, but it was raised to an acute and sustained crisis by the existence of nuclear weapons and the develop- ment of rocket missiles. The combination threatened the survival of man as a civilized being, although it probably did not threaten his continue existence, after a nuclear holocaust, on a degraded social level as a distm c species of living being.

The annihilation of man, as shown in such works, is technically possible, but will certainly not re- sult from the weapons which would be used in total thermonuclear war. However, there is always a remote possibility that a madman such as Hitler might decide to destroy the human race as revenge for the frus- tration of his insane ambitions. This could be done in a number of ways, 01 which the simplest would be to encase a large number of thermo- nuclear bombs in thick layers of cobalt; the ensuing fallout of radioac- tive cobalt 60 could extinguish all animal life on earth (excluding most Plants, insects, and other invertebrates). No sane policy would use such a °omb, since cobalt 60 is 320 times as radioactive as radium, and it would require at least four hundred such bombs, each at least one ton in weight, 0 release enough radioactivity to extinguish all animal life on earth. However, even without a cobalt bomb, any extensive nuclear war v °uld kill hundreds of millions of human beings and would release Urncient radioactivity to inflict such extensive genetic damage that sub- eo .uent generations of human beings would produce a substantial per- entage of monsters; this fact, added to the genetic damage to birdlife, 'Rht create a situation where men would be unable to compete success- 'y With insects (who are much more immune to genetic damage from radioactivity). * he balance of nuclear weapons is a central factor in the Cold War, nc e no agreement on cessation of nuclear testing, nuclear disarmament, °nventional disarmament, or relaxation of tension can occur until both es recognize that a nuclear balance of equilibrium (the so-called \"nu- ea r stalemate\") has been achieved. This came close to achievement r| V in 1950, when both sides had atomic weapons, but was destroyed hat time by President Truman's order to proceed with the develop- nt of the hydrogen bomb. It was not achieved again until the end of 9<J2, because when both sides had achieved the H-bomb by 1956, that ance Was disturbed by the missile race, which reached its widest dis- Suilibrium with the Soviet success with \"Sputnik\" in October 1957.

As a matter of fact, the ance was not equal, since the American total capability in nuclear war as tar superior to that of the Soviet Union in 1963, but weapons devel- Pfient had reached approximately the same point; the United States s more vulnerable to Russia's fewer weapons because a larger part of its Pulation was industrial and urban, and the Soviet Union had growing L ° D ' e nis in other areas, notably its alienation from Communist China.

About the same time, the Cuban Crisis of October 1962, somewhat like the Fashoda Crisis of 1898, by bringing the United States and the Soviet Union to the edge of a war that neither wanted, revealed to both the mutual balance of error and the need to do something about it. All this marked the end of the historical period which began in 1945. The chief subdivisions of the history of nuclear balance over the period 1945-1963 are as follows: 1. The American Atomic Monopoly from Alamogordo in June 1945 to the first Soviet atom bomb (\"Joe I\") in August 1949. 2. A brief nuclear balance from 1949 to 1950. 3. The Race for the Hydrogen Bomb from January 1950 through the first American hydrogen fusion at Eniwetok in November 1952 an<i the first Soviet H-bomb explosion of August 1953 to the American achievement of a practical thermonuclear weapon in March 1954- This contest continued for two more years as each side tried to perfect the new weapon as an aerial bomb. The United States made its first successful air drop of a fusion bomb on May 21, 1956—almost certainly later than the comparable Soviet test. 4. The Race for the ICBM from 1956 to 1962 has been widely misunder- stood because propaganda falsehoods from both sides sought to con- ceal the true situation and often confused even themselves. Basically the problem was, at the beginning, how to combine the American Nagasaki bomb, which weighed 9,000 pounds, with the German > -? rocket, which carried a warhead of 1,700 pounds only 200 miles. ™ Soviet government sought to close the gap between rocket power an nuclear payload by working toward a more powerful rocket, whi' e the Americans, over the opposition of the air force and the aviatio industry, sought to close the gap by getting smaller bombs. The resu of the race was that the Soviet government acquired a series of very powerful rocket boosters ranging in thrust from 800,000 pounds 1.5 million pounds, and capable of hurling capsules from one to ov seven tons in weight. These were demonstrated to an astonish^ world from October 1957 onward. These Soviet successes in space made the American effort in rocK e boosters look very second-rate, but this impression was rather misleading' It was perfectly true that the United States in 1957-1960 had no po\\ve f ' ful rocket boosters capable of hurling large space vehicles into orbit past the moon (as was done with the 3,245-pound Soviet Lunik 1 January 1959), but the United States in this period had a large nurnb e of fission and fusion warheads in a great variety of sizes, and was rapid y"},{"pageNumber":892,"pageContent":"NUCLEAR RIVALRY AND THE COLD WAR: 1945-1950 877 developing moderately powerful rockets able to carry these great dis- tances. In fact, the first American ICBA1 was fired from Cape Canaveral in December 1957, two months after Sputnik I, and went full range in November 1958. % 1961 the United States had a varied assortment of missiles, both solid- and liquid-fueled, some able to be fired in minutes, and capable of carrying nuclear warheads, whose explosive power was equivalent to as •ttle as 750,000 tons of TNT (thus forty-three times the force of the Hiroshima A-bomb) to 5,000,000 or more tons of TNT. These could be delivered distances from 1,000 to over 6,000 miles and with such accu- rac y that at least half could be landed in a circle within 3 miles of a target. These developments left the Soviet Union with a much smaller number °r giant rockets able to carry 20-megaton (20,000,000 tons of TNT) Warheads, but so large that their locations were soon spied out by Amer- lcan high-flying U-2 photographic planes. To remedy this overemphasis ° n size, the Soviet Union, in October 1961, broke the moratorium on nuclear explosive testing which had existed since October 1958, and ex ploded a great variety of small bombs from 1 to 5 megatons, as well s a gigantic one of 25 megatons and a colossal one of 58 megatons; the att er, the largest bomb ever exploded, was equal to one-third the total of a \" previous nuclear explosions from 1945 to the end of previous testing m December 1958. kven before these final tests, in i960 elaborate calculations on the giant electronic computers in the Pentagon were estimating the conse- quences of a hypothetical total nuclear war in June 1963. Two answers *ere: (1) if the Soviet Union struck first and the United States re- lated, the war would be over in a single day with a Russian victory in v hich they lost 40 million of their 220 million population dead and 40 Percent of their industrial capacity, while America would have 150 Million of its 195 million people dead and 60 percent of its industry de- st royed, ( 2 ) If the United States struck first with a nuclear attack, in * e Pty to a Soviet advance of ground troops into Germany, 75 million Russians and 110 million Americans would be killed, half the industry of ot h would be destroyed, and neither could win. On this basis, some ela xation of tension became imperative, as soon as the Soviets could.be atisfied they had achieved stalemate by their 1961-1962 nuclear tests. Closely related to this four-stage sequence of nuclear capability is the l u ite different four-stage sequence of strategic planning. This is con- erned with what we plan to do as distinct from what we are able to do. r °m the American side it has four stages, as follows: '• 'Great Power Cooperation\" within the United Nations Organization, l0 45-i94<5-"},{"pageNumber":893,"pageContent":"878  TRAGEDY AND HOPE 2. \"Containment of\" Soviet expansion by all means available, including economic aid to others (the Marshall Plan), conventional forces (as in NATO), and nuclear weapons, 1946-1953. 3. \"Liberation,\" \"Massive Retaliation,\" and the \"New Look,\" IO53-IO 6 °- This period, associated with the influence of Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, sought to deal with foreign crisis by the use of slogans and quite unrealistic policies which could never have been used. Our allies, the neutrals, and even the Russians were ignored and often despised, while the State Department engaged in what Dulles himself called, in January 1956, \"going to the brink\" of war. This policy sought to reduce government spending and balance the budget by reducing expenditures for all local or conventional wars and to base our strategy and our foreign policy on the threat that any Soviet advance of any kind anywhere of which we disapproved would be stopped by our \"massive retaliation\" with all-out nuclear attack any- where we judged appropriate, on a unilateral (without consultation with our allies) and on a \"first-strike\" basis (that is, we would do this even if the Soviet Union had not attacked us and had not used nuclear weapons). This policy was hopelessly irresponsible and not only alienated allies (such as France) and neutrals (such as India), but could not be used, since we would never adopt such suicidal and ineffective tactics to reply to a Communist local advance in Korea, southeast Asia, Tibet, Afghanistan, Iran, Egypt, Yugoslavia, or most other places on the periphery of the Soviet bloc. This policy aban- doned NATO, in fact if not in theory, and meant that we had publicly adopted a policy we would never carry out; because even » we were willing to accept the full consequences of the Soviet nuclear counterblow to our \"massive retaliation\" we could not ever win in such a war, since Soviet ground forces, with their 125 divisions in Europe, could easily overrun NATO's 25 divisions and would occupy all Europe except Britain and Spain. The Kremlin leaders, moving t0 Paris or Rome (perhaps in the Vatican) would be beyond our reach and could hold London under nuclear threat, while both the United States and the Soviet Union were devastated. The Dulles doctrine was not a doctrine of action but solely a doctrine of threats, since it expected that the threat alone would stop Soviet advances and that it would never be necessary to carrv out the threat. The policy worked, in the sense that the world and the United States lived through it, only because the Soviet Union, at the same time, was in the \"inter- regnum\" between the death of Stalin (March 5, 1952) and the acces- sion to full power of Khrushchev (July 4, 1957 to March 27, i95 8 )' The last two years were occupied by the Eisenhower administration s efforts to get back to a more workable defense policy based on a variety of responses to Soviet actions and to do so without either repudiating Dulles or excessively unbalancing the budget."},{"pageNumber":894,"pageContent":"NUCLEAR RIVALRY AND THE COLD WAR: 1945-IQ5O 879 4- 'Graduated deterrence,\" from i960 onward, was really an effort to get back to the polices of 1950 as advocated by the National Security Council paper NSC 58 of March 1950, and generally to the advice given by Robert Oppenheimer before his public career had been de- stroyed by the \"massive retaliation\" advocates in 1953. This revived doctrine called for a graduated and varied strategic response to Soviet aggression combined with cooperation with our allies, recog- nition of the rights of neutrals to be neutral, increased economic and cultural aid to both groups, and relaxation of tension with the Soviet Union by cultural and scientific cooperation. This broad and varied program had at its core development of at least four levels of possible war: (1) war with conventional weapons; (2) addition of tactical nuclear weapons; (3) strategic nuclear attack on a \"no cities\" basis (with attacks aimed only at Soviet military bases and installa- tions); and (4) the \"total-devastation response.\" Each of these had subgradations and gave rise to unsolved problems such as \"escalation,\" that is, the possibility that one level would develop gradually into a more intense level in the heat of combat. Moreover, such complex responses required immense outlays of money, even if the achievement °f the whole was spread over many years. But this cost, it was felt, would be worthwhile, since nuclear warfare on a \"no cities\" basis would save about 100 million American lives in the first week of war M comparison with war on the \"total-devastation\" level. One element ln this whole strategic shift was the shift of the emphasis of our response from Strategic Air Command (SAC) nuclear bombing to conventional army forces and to the navv's nuclear submarines with Polaris missiles. The former would reduce the temptation to the Soviet Union to instigate local \"brush-fire\" wars, while the latter would be even more successful in preventing any Soviet nuclear \"first strike,\" s, nce such an attack would be much less able to find and destroy Polaris submarines than it would be to wipe out fixed SAC bases. Ihe next great aspect of postwar history was the partisan political str uggles within the United States, centering on the rise and decline of bilateralism and neo-isolationism. As we shall see in a later chapter, the Party struggle in the United States took the form of a struggle between e party of the middle classes, the Republicans, and the party of the m ges, the Democrats. This lineup, with its multitude of exceptional ases, found the intellectuals (including the scientists), the internation- lst s, the minorities, and the cosmopolitans in the Democratic Party, . Jt \" the businessmen, bankers, and clerks in the Republican Party. The °'ationism of the latter, combined with their inability to cope with the , d depression or with the international crisis arising from Hitler, kept e Democrats in the White House for twenty years (1933-1953)- The e eat of Dewey by Truman in 1948 was a particularly bitter pill, and"},{"pageNumber":895,"pageContent":"880  TRAGEDY AND HOPE the Republican partisans after that event were ready to adopt any weapon which could be used to discredit the Democratic administration. They found such a weapon ready at hand in the neo-isolationist forces within the Republican Party which were entrenched in the Congress by the seniority system of committee controls which operated there. Since either party in the United States wins a presidential election on a national (and not on a local) basis and by appealing to the moderate middle- group people who are willing to shift their vote and to consider the issues presented, a partv which is long out of the White House will be reduced to the control of its local, narrow, ignorant, and extremist core which is unwilling to consider issues or the national welfare, or to shift their party stand and votes. For these reasons, the Republican Party had fallen into congressional control (represented by Senate figures such as Senators Robert Taft, Kenneth Wherry, Styles Bridges, and William Jenner) of those who were most ignorant of the real issues and were most remote from any conceptions of national political responsibility. This group, to whom we often give the name \"neo-isolationist,\" knew nothing of the world outside the United States, and generally despised it- Thus, they gave no consideration to our allies or neutrals, and saw no reason to know or to study Russia, since it could be hated completely without need for accurate knowledge. All foreigners were regarded as unprincipled, weak, poor, ignorant, and evil, with only one aim in hie- namely, to prey on the United States. These neo-isolationists and uni- lateralists were equally filled with suspicion or hatred of any American intellectuals, including scientists, because they had no conception of any man who placed objective truth higher than subjective interests, since such an attitude was a comolete challenge to the American businessman assumption that all men are and should be concerned with the pursuit o self-interest and profit. At the end of the war, it was but natural that many Americans shou seek to return from foreign and incomprehensible matters, including countries, peoples, and problems which were a standing refutation or t American neo-isolationist's ideas of human nature, of social structur , and of proper motivations. Neo-isolationism had a series of assumptions which explain t» e statements and actions and which could not possibly be held by any 0 who had anv knowledge of the world outside American lower-midd class business circles. These beliefs were at least seven in number: i. Unilateralism: the belief that the United States should and could ac by itself without need to consider allies, neutrals, or the Soviet Uni° ' 2.

This assumes that American power permits it to do what it wishes and that demonstration of this power to troublemaking foreigners will make them leave the United States alone and secure forever. This idea was reflected in its crudest form m the belief that America's power could be applied to the world in one final smash after which everything would be settled forever. Upholders of this view refused to accept that America's security in the nineteenth century had been an untypical and temporary condition and that constant danger and constant problems were a perpet- ual condition of human life except in brief and unusual circum- stances. This kind of impatience with foreign problems and danger Was clearly stated by Dulles in his article \"A Policy of Boldness\" in *~ l U magazine, May 19, 1952. There he insisted that the Truman policy of containment must be replaced by a policy of \"liberation,\" since the former was based on \"treadmill policies which at best might Perhaps keep us in the same place until we drop exhausted.\" These Policies, he argued, would lead to financial collapse and loss of civil \"berries, were \"not designed to win victory conclusively,\" and did n °t seek to solve the problem of the Soviet Union but to live with it, presumably forever.\" His solution was to refuse to recognize Commu- nist control either in the European satellites or in China, to deny the existence of the Iron Curtain, and to free millions enslaved by Com- munism. Although the onlv way these millions could be freed was by ^ar, Dulles refused to advocate preventive war, and established no method of achieving his goals except his belief that, if he refused to face reality, reality would change. However, he did accept preventive War in the form of massive retaliation if the Communists made any further advances, and he established the argument that the Truman policy of containing the Communists was a policy of refusing to \"ereat them, from softness or fear or sympathy. This became the basis or future partisan Republican charges that Democratic administra- wns were \"soft on Communism\" and pursued \"no-win\" policies. *• the neo-isolationist belief in American omnipotence and foreign in- eriority led, almost at once, to the conclusion that continuance of the oviet threat arose from internal treason within America and that the Russian nuclear successes must be based on treason and espionage and c ould not possibly be based on foreign science or Soviet industrial capability. The neo-isolationists were convinced that the only threat 0 America came from internal subversion, from Communist sym- pathizers and \"fellow travelers,\" since no foreign threat could harm ou r omnipotence.

Henry Wallace an Mrs. Roosevelt, who were the special targets of these isolationists, were accused of conspiring to give away America's wealth (in orde to weaken it): \"a quart of milk to every Hottentot.\" 5. Since the chief \"high moral principle\" which motivated the neo- isolationists was their own economic self-interest, they were especial) agitated bv high taxes, and insisted that Soviet Russia and the Dem°' crats were engaged in a joint tacit conspiracy to destroy America ) high taxes bv using Cold War crisis to tax America into bankruptcy • 6. Since the neo-isolationists rejected all partial solutions or limited goa - and were unwilling to pav to increase America's military power (sm c they insisted it was alreadv overwhelmingly powerful), there was H' tie they could do in foreign affairs except to talk loudly and sig anti-Communist pacts and manifestos. This explains Dulles's vert) bluster and \"missile rattling\" and his pactomania which kept him rU ning about the world signing documents which bound people to purs anti-Communist policies. 7. The unrealistic and unhistoric nature of neo-isolationism meant tn it could not actually be pursued as a policy. It was pursued by J° Foster Dulles, with permanent injury to our allies, the neutrals, an the personnel of American government, but it was not followed in v Pentagon and was followed only halfheartedly by Eisenhower 10 the ddle White House. The President sought to keep the moderate mi group of voters in his camp by radiating his personal charm around the country, but the Pentagon refused to follow Dulles's tactics of ap- peasing the neo-isolationists by refusing to defend their departmental employees. When Senator McCarthy turned his extravagant charges or subversion and treason from the State Department to the army, the employees of the latter were defended by Secretary Robert Stevens, and AicCarthy's downfall began. The neo-isolationist forces, although defeated at the ballot box in i960 and 1962, still continue in an in- creasingly irresponsible form under a variety of names, including J° nn Birch Society members, or, more generally, as the \"Radical Right- Much less obvious to the public eye than neo-isolationism, but equally influential in creating the history of 1945-1963, was the struggle within the American defense sen-ices as to what use would be made of'the nuclear weapon.

Morever, the range and in- e nsity of its destruction gave rise to immediate claims from the advo- cates of air power that massed ground forces, slow-moving armored ec l Ul pment, and all naval vessels, especially the expensive carriers and Ca Pital ships, were made obsolete bv the new weapon. These extravagant aims were made more critical in their impact by the Strategic Bomb- ln g Surveys of World War II and the demobilization problems at the w ar's end. I he advocates of air power from at least 1908 had made extravagant air ns, usually based on future rather than on presently available equip- en t, that the airplane provided the final supreme weapon which made other methods of warfare unnecessary.

Douhet as early as 1921 preached that the next war would be y e d in the first twenty-four hours bv the total destruction of all enemy es from the air; Mitchell in the mid-1920's raised a great furor with his mis that land-based planes had made battleships and lesser naval ves- ^ s obsolete; and Seversky, before, during, and after World War II, 'nied that air power had made other arms needless. We have seen how cse claims had a considerable and pernicious influence on men's actions ore and during World War II. Many airmen who did not believe these \"11s nevertheless felt that they had to support them in order to obtain ar ge slice of their country's defense funds from civilian politicians who J^ c HI no position to judge the merits of such claims. I he experience of World War II did not, at first glance, support the ms of the advocates of air power. On November 3, 1944, the United e s Secretary of War, on order of the President, set up a committee Welve to conduct a Strategic Bombing Survey to examine the con- ation of strategic bombing to final victory by evaluating bomb dam- I ' asse ssing captured German and Japanese documents, and interview- 6 the leaders of the defeated countries. The German survey, which e out in 208 parts over several years, beginning in 1945, did not, on Whole, support the claims of the air enthusiasts, but rather showed the air-force contribution was much less than had been anticipated oped and had become substantial, chiefly in transportation and in ln e supplies, only after October 1944, when Germany was already en (with tactical air-force help) on the ground, lese conclusions were very unwelcome to the army air-force officers . e d to strategic bombing, and especiallv to the airplane-manufactur- 6 mdustry, which had reached the multibillion-dollar size and hoped etain at least some of its market after the war's end.

Loss of faith in strategic bombing Mould expose air-force officers and the air-force industry to a grim and poverty-stricken postwar world. Accordingly, it became nec- essary to both groups to persuade the country that Japan had been de- feated by strategic air power. The Strategic Bombing Survey of Jap an did not support this contention, although by concentrating on strategic bombing it helped to cover up the vital role played by submarines in t' 1 ^ destruction of the Japanese merchant marine, the equally vital role plaV e by the early Marine Corps work in amphibious warfare, and, above a > in the magnificent job done by naval supply forces for all arms, inclu ing the strategic bombing bases themselves. The protection and supp) of these bases in the Marianas was in sharp contrast with the loss of o-z° bases in continental China to Japanese ground forces, and showed to a ) unbiased outsider the need for a balanced distribution of all arms in a J effective defense system. In such a balanced system the role of strategic bombing and of large long-range planes in general (as contrasted Wi tactical planes and fighters) would obviously be less than either the ai force officers or the airplane industrialists considered satisfactory. Accordingly, it became urgent for these two groups and their sup porters to convince the country (1) that the atom bomb was not ) another\" weapon but was the finaL, \"absolute,\" weapon; (2) that atom bomb had been the decisive factor in the Japanese surrender; a (3) that nuclear weapons were fitted only for air-force use and co not be, or should not be, adapted for naval or ground-force use. The ft two of these points were fairly well established in American p u opinion in 1945-1947, but the third, because of atomic secrecy, largely to be argued out behind the scenes. All three points were lafg • untrue (or true only if hedged about with reservations which wo largely destroy their value as air-force propaganda), but those who u them were defending interests, not truth, even when they insisted the interests they were defending were those of the United States not merely those of the air force. In this controversy, the scientists, of whom were naively defending truth, were bound to be crushed- the other hand, any dissident scientist could obtain access to money support by making an alliance with the air force.  . r At the center of this problem was the struggle for control of n uC reactions within the United States, but the ultimate objective of the str g gle was the right to exercise influence on the subdividing of the na defense budget.

His social and, to a greater extent, his political education did not begin until about 1935, when e was thirty-one and already a full professor at California Institute of e chnology and at the University of California. His political naivete continued until after the war. He had always been a persuasive talker, got along very well with a wide diversity of people, and during the war e discovered he was an excellent administrator. By 1947 he was the chief cientific adviser to most of the important agencies of the government, formally, if not formally, since other scientists frequently consulted Vlt _ Wm before giving their decisions on problems. From 1947 on, he was cn; urman of the GAC, as well as a member of the Atomic Energy Com- mittee of the Defense Department's Research and Development Board; of National Science Foundation; of the President's Scientific Advisory oard; chairman of the board of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists; and onsultant on atomic energy to the CIA, to the State Department, to the ational Security Council, to the American delegation to the United ations, and to the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy \\ le congressional watchdog over the AEC)— in all, he was on a total thirty-five government committees. ln spite of Oppenheimer's exalted positions in 1947-195 3, which in- p.ed the directorship of the great Institute for Advanced Study in ln ceton (American copy of All Souls College at Oxford), there was Udow on Oppenheimer's past.

It was an essential element in the massiv retaliation, neo-isolationist, McCarthyite, Dulles interregnum of 1953\" 1957, which ran almost exactly parallel to the post-Stalin interregn u in the Soviet Union during the same years. The last significant factor in this postwar period of eighteen years w provided by the events in the Far East. In this factor also there a three subperiods, of which the most significant was the middle one rr \"the loss of China\" to the Communists late in 1949 to the Geneva 'Sum mit Conference\" of July 1955. In this period the Far East was in con sion over the Chinese victory in mainland China; the outbreak or w> in Korea in June 1950; the Korean armistice of July 1953; tne , Chinese war and armistice in 195 3-1954; and the threatened Chin Communist attack on Quemoy, if not on Formosa, in the winter of I95-+ 1955. The earlier period of Far Eastern history saw the slow decay the Nationalist Chinese regime of Chiang Kai-shek and the reviva Japan, while the later, third, period centered upon the growing streng and dangerous pugnacity of \"Red\" China.

The Origins of the Cold War, 1945-1949 Ihe surrender of Japan left much of the world balanced between the as s armies of the Soviet Union and the American nuclear monopoly. Was an unequal balance, because the United States would not have se d its atomic weapon against the Russians for anything Russia was * e 'y to do. Stalin realized this, and largely ignored the atom bomb, al- ° u gh his designer, Andrei Tupolev, successfully copied four B-29's aptured by the Russians in the Far East in 1944 and brought these to P oduction (as Tu-4's) in 1947. Otherwise, the Kremlin's assessment of e situation was quite mistaken. Stalin assumed that the United States would soon relapse into isola- 10r »sm, as it had done after World War I, and would be fully occupied \"i a postwar economic collapse like that of 1921. Accordingly, he re- 6 tded Britain as the chief obstacle to his plans, and, seeing that it was J n small and weak, with most unpromising economic prospects, he r °ceeded to carry out his designs with relatively little attention to the c tions of either English-speaking Power. These plans involved the ation of a Soviet-controlled buffer fringe of satellite states on the So- rrontiers in all areas occupied by Soviet armies, and Communist Nation governments beyond these areas. In both cases the local Com- nists would be controlled by leaders of their own nationality who had etl trained under Comintern auspices in the Soviet Union. In some es > these Communist leaders had been exiles in Russia for more than twenty years. he chief error in Stalin's postwar strategy was his total misjudgment \"resident Truman and, on a wider stage, of the American people as .hole. Some of this error undoubtedly arose from Stalin's ignorance he world outside Russia and from the fact that his terrorist tactics in • Ssia m the 1930's had made it difficult for him to get reliable foreign °rmation from his diplomatic corps, which was shielded from contact \" foreigners and was more concerned with sending Stalin the informa- j he expected than with that derived from independent observations. any Case ^ Kremlin misjudged both Truman and the American People.  ' B"},{"pageNumber":903,"pageContent":"TRAGEDY AND HOPE Truman, in spite of a natural suspicion of the Russians, ended the war with every intention of trying to carry out Roosevelt's original plans for postwar cooperation with the Soviet Union. In addition, having learned much from the 1920*5, he intended to make every effort to avoid either a postwar economic depression or a relapse into isolationism. His success in avoiding these events made it possible to reverse his inherited policy of cooperation with Russia when Stalin's actions in 1946-1947 made it clear that cooperation was the last thing the Kremlin wanted. These ac- tions appeared most clearly in regard to Germany. We have already noted the Soviet subversion of Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria by native Communists returning from Russia under the protec- tion of the Soviet armies. The same thing occurred, but more gradually, in eastern Germany. There the Communists at first pretended to co- operate with any \"anti-Fascist\" groups, but their unwillingness to coop- erate with the Western Powers in the administration of Germany ap- peared almost at once. They gradually closed off their occupation zone and refused to carry out the earlier agreements to treat Germany as a single administrative and economic unit. This meant that the usual eco- nomic exchange within Germany of food from the agricultural eastern portion of the country for the industrial products of western Germany was broken. Instead, East German food was drained to the Soviet Lnion- To prevent starvation of the West Germans, the United States and Brit- ain had to send in hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of food an other supplies. On May 3, 1946, General Lucius D. Clay, head of r ne American Military Government in Germany, informed the Russians tna no future agreements would be made to ship West German industrr equipment as reparations to Russia until the Russians agreed to treat Crf - many as an economic unit and to give some accounting of their repar tions plundering of East Germany. Both points referred to open violatio of the Potsdam Agreement regarding the treatment of Germany. The Soviet Union justified these and other violations of earlier agre ments on the urgent need for their own economic rehabilitation. l ne can be no doubt that the Soviet Union had suffered great econom damage from the war, possibly the loss of a quarter of its prewar wea * more than all the other victor countries combined, but the Kremlin cou have obtained much more by continued cooperation with the Lw States than it did from its postwar policy of studied enmity. This ennu was based on a number of factors: In the first place, Stalin was nlis by the false ideology of Marx and Lenin w hich spoke of the inevitable struggle of capitalism and Communism, of the inevitable economic brea & down of the capitalist system, and of the capitalist endeavor to avo such a breakdown by militarist aggression. On this basis, Stalin could n believe that the United States was prepared to be generous and cooper tive toward the Soviet Union."},{"pageNumber":904,"pageContent":"NUCLEAR RIVALRY AND THE COLD WAR: I 945-I 950 889 Moreover, Stalin was worried by the weakness in depth of the Soviet s\\stem from economic damage and from ideological dissent. The war ad been fought on an ideology of patriotism and nationalism, not as a omrnunist ideological struggle, and the Kremlin by 1946 was eager to pt back to its Communist ideology, partly as justification of the new la rdships of reconstruction under the fourth Five-Year Plan (March 13, '94<5) and partly to overcome the Russian soldiers' admiration for what e V had seen of the West. These soldiers, for example, were amazed 0 discover that the \"exploited\" German workers of whom they had ear d so much had standards of living several times higher than those of e ordinary Russian. The discovery that ordinary Germans had watches, Ven wristwatches, was an astounding revelation to the Russian soldiers, \"o proceeded to seize these wherever they saw them. ^ third factor guiding Soviet behavior was the discovery that there as no mass support for Russia or for Communist ideology in eastern n d central Europe, especially among the peasants, and that the buffer °* Communist states along Russia's western border would have to be uilt on force and not on consent. The governments of these states could e recruited from men of the respective nations who had been living in ^ e Soviet Union for vears under endless Communist indoctrination, but e unindoctrinated masses in each country would have to be held in °ndage by Soviet military forces, at least until local Communist par- es and local secret-police organizations subservient to Moscow's orders ° u Id be built up. The urgent need for this, from the Kremlin's point view, was shown, when Austria and Hungary, although under Soviet Uitary occupation, were permitted relatively free elections in Novem- er 1945. Both resulted in sharp defeats for the local Communist parties. e cause such an outcome could not be permitted in the buffer satellites art her east, elections there had to be postponed until the local govern- ents were sufficiently communized and entrenched to be able to guar- nt ee a favorable outcome to any election. \" was this situation which made it impossible, in Russia's view, to Car ry out the promises made at Yalta and elsewhere about free elections \"oland or other countries neighboring on Russia.

These disputes over Germany and eastern Europe, which were re- garded in the West as Soviet violations of their earlier agreements a Yalta and Potsdam, were regarded in Moscow as evidence for Stalm conviction of the secret aggressive designs of the West. By the winter 1045-1946, the Russian peoples were being warned of the dangers fron the West. This began in 1945 with attacks on \"cosmopolitanism\" an prohibitions of Soviet soldiers \"fraternizing\" with aliens, especially so- diers of the United States or Britain, in the course of their occupatio duties. Earlv in November 1945, Molotov warned the Moscow Sovie that Fascism and imperialist aggression were still loose in the won Similar speeches were made by other Soviet leaders, including Stalin, o) the spring of 1946, xenophobia, one of the oldest of Russian culture traits, was rampant again. In September 1946, and again in September '947' Andrei Zhdanov, the Kremlin's leader of the international Communis movement, made speeches which were simply declarations of ideologic' war on the West. Thev presented the Soviet Union as the last best hope of man, surrounded by prowling, capitalist beasts of prey seeking to c stroy it. On this basis the Soviet Union found it impossible to cooperate wi the West or to accept the American economic assistance in reconstru tion which was offered. The American Congress in the last renewal 0 the Lend-Lease Act in 1945 had forbidden use of these funds for p oS ' war rehabilitation, but other funds were made available. For the trans tional period these amounted to about $9 billion. These transitional tun were made available on a humanitarian and economic basis and not political or ideological grounds. Accordingly, they were available to the Soviet Union and other areas under Communist control in accordan with the provisions of each fund. For example, the United Nations Re\" and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), was an international or- ganization which handled goods worth 13,683 million, of which 65 pcrce was provided from the United States, 15 percent from Britain, and y. percent from Canada. Its grants went to 17 countries with China ($518 million), Poland next ($478 million), Italy with $418 million, Yugo- slavia with $416 million, and the Ukraine, seventh, with $188 million- Bevond the primary, humanitarian aim of most United States assista was the desire to get local economies functioning, and efforts to fur America's basic conviction of the value of a high level of internatio trade on a multilateral basis. The United States was opposed to a' strictive trade measures such as autarchy, bilateralism, or quotas, and as its ultimate aim the restoration of multilateral trade at the highest p sible level, with freely convertible international monetary exchanges- was convinced that such a system would be advantageous for all people"},{"pageNumber":906,"pageContent":"NUCLEAR RIVALRY AND THE COLD WAR: 1945-1950 89I and did not see that it was anathema to the Soviet system, which had restrictions and quotas on economic life, even within the country, so Jnat, while most Russians lived in poverty, a privileged minority, buying ln s pecial stores with special funds and special ration cards, had access to 'Usuries undreamed of by the ordinary person. m the American plans for economic recovery, Great Britain, as the World's greatest trader, had a special role. The United Kingdom could not exist without very large imports, but it could not pay for these with- out large exports. Such exports had to be much larger than before the Vv ar, even to pay for the prewar level of imports, because many of Brit- ain s prewar sources of overseas incomes from investments, shipping, in- surance, and so on, had been drastically reduced by the war. In 1945 \" e British balance-of-pavments deficit was about 875 million pounds sterling, and in 1946 it was still 344 million pounds. To tide over this deficit until British exports could recover, the United States in July '946 provided Britain with a credit of $3,750 million, with interest at * percent and repayment in fifty annual installments to begin on De- cember 31, IQIJI. The interest was to be waived whenever the British ra de balance would not pay for imports on her 1936-1938 level. In re- urn f ( , r this, Britain gave rather indefinite promises to work to reduce s bilateralism in trade, especially imperial preference, and to release, as soon as feasible, its blocked sterling accounts. •-end-Lease was ended in September 1945, with the Japanese sur- endcr, and all claims were settled with Britain under an agreement of ecember 1945. This canceled the American grants under Lend-Lease of Vcr $30,000 million and gave Britain permanent establishments on British •O\", with supplies in Britain or en route, for a settlement of $650 million Payable on the same terms as the British loan just mentioned. Assistance similar to these was available to the Soviet Union but was generally rebuffed. Even in 1945, efforts to establish international emer- gency committees for coal, transportation, and economic recovery in -urope were boycotted by the Soviet Union, with the exception of the nc on transportation, which Mas necessary to supply the Russian troops, 'ttlc cooperation could be obtained from Soviet authorities for handling aiding refugees, except for their demands for the return, to concen- \"ition ca mps or slave labor, of those who had fled from eastern Europe. n October 15, 1945, Moscow signed an agreement similar to Britain's > which they agreed to pay, after July 1954, for the quarter-billion dol- rs Wortli of goods on their final Lend-Lease demands yet unfilled when -end-Lease ended; but they refused to discuss any general Lend-Lease \"Orient and they refused to negotiate for a general loan, similar to that at 'e to Britain, although Stalin had asked for one of $6 billion as early January 1945.

The offer was renewed"},{"pageNumber":907,"pageContent":"892  TRAGEDY AND HOPE in April and again in September 1946, but the American aims of multi- lateral trade free of artificial restraints except tariffs, like the American insistence on free elections, were regarded in A'loscow as clear evidence of America's aggressive aims. One significant, but perhaps not essential, factor in the deterioration of the relations of the Big Three in 1945 and 1946 lies in the provincial ignorance of the three foreign ministers, Byrnes, Bevan, and Molotov, who conducted the negotiations. All three were men of limited back- ground and narrow outlook who saw the world from a narrow national- istic point of view and were incapable of appreciating the outlook 01 different cultures or the different values and verbal meanings to be found in alien minds. Nevertheless, it does seem clear that the postwar break- down of cooperation was inevitable in view of the conceptions of public authority, state power, and political security to be found in all three countries. On the whole, if blame must be allotted, it may well be placed at the door of Stalin's office in the Kremlin. American willingness to cooperate continued until 1947, as is evident from the fact that the Marshall Plan offer of American aid for a cooperative European recovery effort w aS opened to the Soviet Union, but it now seems clear that Stalin had de- cided to close the door on cooperation and adopted a unilateral policy ° limited aggression about February or March of 1946. The beginning 0 the Cold War may be placed at the date of this inferred decision or ma> r be placed at the later and more obvious date of the Soviet refusal t accept Marshall Plan aid in July 1947. The significance of the latter date is revealed by the fact that Czechoslovakia, which accepted on July 7 r ' was forced by Stalin's direct order to Prime Minister Gottwald to re- verse this decision on July 10th. One significant encouragement to Soviet aggression came from tn almost total demobilization of the American war effort. Pressure fro\" 1 special-interest groups such as business, labor unions, and cattlerne > aroused public opinion for the ending of price controls and rationing an obtained cooperation from an anti-New Deal coalition in Congress t end most of the nation's economic controls in 1946. At the same tim came almost total military demobilization. In spite of Ambassador Ha \" riman's explicit warnings from Moscow in April 1945, and Stalin's decia ration of cold warfare in February 1946, the American government ca - ried out the demobilization plan of September 1943, which was based 0 individual rather than on unit discharges. This destroyed the combat e - fectiveness of all units by the end of 1945, when almost half the nie had been demobilized, and every unit, as a result, was at 50 percent. 1 army's 8 million men in August 1945 was at 4% million by the end 0 the year and reached 1.9 million by July 1946.

The most critical example of the Soviet refusal to cooperate and of 1,: s insistence on relapsing into isolation, secrecy, and terrorism is to be round in its refusal to join in American efforts to harness the dangerous powers of nuclear fission. Long before the test at Alamogordo, some of ne nuclear scientists, spurred on once again by Szilard, were trying to warn American political leaders of the unique character of the dangers r °ni this source. Centered in the Chicago Argonne Laboratories, this group wished to prevent the use of the bomb on Japan, slow up bomb \\°ut not general nuclear) research, establish some kind of international c ontrol of the bomb, and reduce secrecy to a minimum. Early in April l0 45* Szilard wrote to President Roosevelt to this effect, and, on the lat- er s death, sought out Byrnes and repeated his views verbally. The fu- Uf e secretary of state found difficulty in grasping Szilard's arguments, specially as they were delivered in a Hungarian accent, but the new resident Truman soon set up an \"Interim\" Committee to give advice °n nuclear problems. This committee, led by Secretary of War Stimson, ^ a s dependent on its scientific members, Bush, Conant, and Karl T. orn pton, for relevant facts or could call on its \"scientific panel\" of u Ppenheimer, Fermi, Arthur H. Compton, and E. O. Lawrence for ad- ice. All these scientists except Fermi were \"official\" scientists, deeply Solved in governmental administrative problems involving large budgets anc * possible grants to their pet projects and universities, and were re- garded with some suspicion by the agitated, largely refugee, scientists jj the Manhattan District laboratories. These suspicions deepened as the official\" scientists recommended use of the bomb on Japan \"near work- ef s' houses.\" At Chicago seven of the agitated scientists, led by James Franck of ^ottingen (Nobel Prize, 1925) and including Szilard and Eugene Ra- 'nowitch, sent another warning letter to Washington. They forecast ue terror of a nuclear arms race which would follow use of the bomb gainst Japan. Later, in July 1945, they presented a petition seeking an n temational demonstration an d international control of the new weapon. zilard obtained sixty-seven signatures to this petition before it was °cked by General Groves and Arthur Compton, using military secrecy an excuse. After Hiroshima this group formed the Association of tomic Scientists, later reorganized as the Federation of Atomic Scien- lst s, whose Bulletin (BAS) has been the greatest influence and source ^formation on all matters concerned with the political and social lm pact of nuclear weapons. The editor of this amazing new periodical Wa s Eugene Rabinowitch. Th , *ne energetic lobbying of this group of atomic scientists had a con- lQ -erable influence on subsequent atomic history. When the \"official"},{"pageNumber":909,"pageContent":"894  TRAGEDY AND HOPE scientists,\" late in 1945, supported the administration's May-Johnson bil 1 which would have shared domestic control of atomic matters with the armed services, the BAS group mobilized public opinion behind the junior senator from Connecticut, Brian McMahon, and pushed through the McMahon bill to presidential signature in August 1946. The McMalW bill set up an Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) of five full-time civi - ian commissioners, named by the President, with David Lilienthal, forme TVA czar, as chairman. This commission, from August 1946, had own- ership and control of all fissionable materials (uranium and thorium; from the mine to the final disposal of atomic wastes, including contro of all plants and process patents, with the right to license private nuclea enterprises free of danger to society. The AEC as it functioned was a disappointment to the BAS scientists. They had sought freedom from military influence and reduced emphasis on the military uses of nuclear fission, free dissemination of theoretics research, and a diminution of the influence of the official scientists. 1 ne y failed on all these points, as the AEC operated largely in terms of weap- ons research and production, remained extravagantly secretive even on purely theoretical matters, and was, because of the scientific ignorance 0 most of the commissioners, inevitably dominated by its scientific advisory committee of \"official\" scientists led by Oppenheimer. To the BAS group and to a wider circle of nonscientists, the A& was a more or less temporary organization within the United States, whose work would be taken over eventually by a somewhat similar inter- national organization. As a first step in this direction, the United J>a- tions, at the suggestion of Bush and Conant and on the joint invitatio of three heads of English-speaking governments (President Truman. Prime Minister Attlee, and Prime Minister Mackenzie King of Canada), set up a United Nations Atomic Energy Commission (UNAEC) of a members of the Security Council plus Canada (January 1946). A Stat Department committee led by Undersecretary Dean Acheson and Davi Lilienthal and a second committee of citizens led by Bernard Baruch spent much of 1946 in the monstrous task of trying to work out some system international control of nuclear energy. The task of educating the non- scientists generally fell on Oppenheimer, who gave dozens of his brilli an 1 extemporaneous, chalk-dusted lectures on nuclear physics. The final p' a < presented to the UN bv Baruch on June 14, 1946, provided an interna tional control body similar to the AEC. It would own, control, or licens all uranium from the mine through processing and use, with operation its own nuclear facilities throughout the world, inspection of all other sue facilities, absolute prohibition of nuclear bombs or diversion of nuclear materials to nonpeaceful purposes, and punishment for evasion or violaOO of its regulations free from the Great Power veto which normally ope \" ated in the Security Council of UN.

This extraordinary offer, an offer to give up the American nuclear Nionopoly, technical secrets, and weapons to an international agency, in return for a possiblv ineffective system of international inspection, was brusquely rejected by Andrei Gromvko on behalf of the Soviet Union within five davs. The Soviet spokesman demanded instead a reverse se- quence of stages covering (1) immediate outlawing and destruction of all nuclear weapons, with prohibition of their manufacture, possession, 0r us e; (2) a subsequent agreement for exchange of information, peace- u l use of atomic energy, and enforcement of regulations; and (3) no tarn pering whatever with the Great Power veto in the UN. Since only tn e United States had the atom bomb at the time, the adoption of this sequence could require the United States to give up the bomb without an >* assurance that anyone else would do anything, least of all adopt any su '>sequent control methods, methods which might allow the Soviet Ur >ion to make its own bombs in secret after the United States had es troyed its in public. The nature of this Soviet suggestion shows clearly \"at the Soviet Union had no real desire for international control, prob- .

Ihe Soviet refusal of the American efforts at international nuclear °ntrol, like their refusal of American loans and economic cooperation, Provides some of the evidence of the Kremlin's state of mind in 1946. This yidence became overwhelming in 1947 and 1948, when Soviet aggres- '°n appeared alone: the whole crescent from Germany, across Asia, to ** Far East. * • in Germany, as we have seen, the area under Soviet occupation was ucreasingly isolated from the West and increasingly communized in- ernally. The Soviet military forces encouraged the formation of a dom- n ant German Socialist Unity Party (SED) under Communist control. °cal provincial elections in the winter of 1946-1947 gave victory to the SED in the Soviet zone and to democratic parties, the Christian erriocrats and Social Democrats, in the provinces of the three Western Zones. Austria was also divided into four areas of military occupation, except at it had a single central government of its own under the old Social e niocrat leader, Karl Renner, who had also been chancellor in 1919. hile the Anglo-Americans supported the Austrians against starvation }' the use of UNRRA assistance, the Soviet zone was systematically ran- *ed.

Only in May ,955, two years after Stal- in s death, was it possible to get Soviet consent to a peace treaty and withdrawal of all four occupying forces (October 1955). Even the friends of Russia suffered from Stalin's pressure and his in- sistence that the Kremlin must remain the center for Communist deci- sions throughout the world. In Yugoslavia, where Tito was originally as anti-Western as Stalin himself, Moscow's efforts to dominate Yugo- slavia alienated Tito completely by a combination of economic, diplo- matic, and propaganda pressure. The rivalry between the two Slavs came to a head at the end of i 947 when Tito tried to build up a non- Russian Communist bloc by signing friendship treaties with Bulgaria. Hungary, and Romania. By March 1948, a complete break between Bel- gradeand Moscow was reached. Tito took his place next to Trotsky in Stalin's list of the damned, and the next few years were filled with efforts to overthrow Tito, and the purging of Tito'sympathizers by Stalin's co- operative jackals in the other Communist satellites. Farther east, strong Soviet pressure had been put on Greece, Turkey, and Iran since i 945 . On Greece this pressure came through the Com- munist regimes in Albania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria, but in Turkey and Iran it came from the Soviet Union directly. These pressures were prob- ably designed to bring into power in the three countries governments relatively favorably inclined toward the Soviet Union to the extent that the latter could obtain a veto power over any collaboration of the three with the Western Powers, especially with Great Britain. This was an ef- fort in which Stalin had few good cards and which showed his ignorance of political conditions in countries outside his own. In these three, as in other countries, most people desired two things: political independence and economic aid. Neither of these could be or would be obtainable from Stalin, the first because it violated his imperious nature and the second because of economic scarcity in the Soviet Union itself. Nevertheless, the effort was made. In Greece the election of March 31, 1946 gave the Popular Party (which supported the king) 23' ° ut of 354 seats in the Chamber. The following September a plebiscite on the return of the monarchy gave 69 percent favorable votes. The Communist groups refused to accept these results and by 1946 were carrying on guerrilla warfare in the mountains, using the three adjacent Communist states as bases for supplies, training, and rest areas. A commission of the Security Council of the UN studied the situation in the early months of 1947 and condemned Greece's three northern neighbors, but a Soviet veto stopped any further action by the UN. Instead, the guerrilla leader \"General Markos\" set up a Greek Provi- sional government in the mountains, but alienated much support among Greece's impoverished peasants by the banditry of his guerrillas and es- pecially by their kidnapping of thousands of peasant children who were"},{"pageNumber":912,"pageContent":"NUCLEAR RIVALRY AND THE COLD WAR: 1945-1950 897 juggled into the three Communist countries for Communist indoctrina- ion. Many of these children did not return for eight or ten years, and \"Undreds vanished forever. Large groups returned from Albania as late as 1963. The Soviet pressure on Turkey was uncalled for and totally unre- niunerative. We have already noted that the Soviet-German accords of 1 940-1941 showed Soviet ambitions for bases \"on the Bosporus and the Dardanelles\" and for a sphere of political influence \"south of Batum and paku in the general direction of the Persian Gulf.\" Thus in this area, as ln tne Far East, Stalin resumed the expansionist aims of czarist Russia. At Potsdam, Stalin had looked even farther afield by asking for a trustee- ^'P in the former Italian colony of Libya and a less definite influence in ^ntrea on the western shore of the Red Sea. These aims were formally demanded by Moscow in September 1945 and in April 1946 (Conference °f Foreign .Ministers in Paris). As early as March 19, 194$, Russia denounced its treaty of friendship with Turl cev and within a few months made demands, both official and unofficial, for Kars, Trebizond, and other areas of northeastern Turkey. ^nu-Turkish agitation was encouraged among the Kurds (a non-Turkish People living at the base of the Anatolian peninsula and divided among lurkey, Iran, and Iraq), and the Georgia Socialist Soviet Republic de- manded eight Turkish provinces covering much of the Black Sea coast an d Kurdistan. On August 8, 1946, Molotov demanded a joint Soviet- Turkish defense of the Straits. Only after Stalin's death, on May 30, 1953, j-\"d the Kremlin renounce the earlier territorial demands on Turkey, but y that time the alienation was complete: Turkey had been driven into ne Western camp, soon allied with Greece and Yugoslavia in a defensive all gnment against the north Balkan Soviet satellites (August 1954), and be came the eastern pillar of NATO. The Soviet aggressions on Iran began in 1945 when Soviet-sponsored Communists, under the protection of the Russian armies occupying Northern Iran, set up \"independent\" Communist governments at Tabriz ari d in Iranian Kurdistan. These were apparently intended to be in- c °rporated into Soviet Azerbaidzhan with the Kurdish areas to be taken torn Turkey, but the failure of the latter scheme made this impossible.

Accordingly, in February 1947, it threatened to withdraw completely from Greece and Turkey by April 1st. On March 12th the American President enunciated the \"Truman Doctrine\" to a joint session of Congress. This stated that \"it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by arrne minorities or by outside pressures.\" He asked for financial assistance to \"free peoples to work out their own destinies in their own way.\" His re- quest for $400 million for aid to Greece and Turkey was granted, after considerable debate, in May 1947. Two weeks later, at Harvard's com- mencement, Secretary of State General George C. Marshall enunciate the \"Marshall Plan,\" which offered American economic support for European Recovery Program which would include the Soviet Union an other Communist states. Once again Stalin's ignorance committed him to an unrewarding path. He rejected this offer, and forced Czecho- slovakia, which had previously accepted, to do the same. The path Stalin was following took a more aggressive turn in '947 and 1948. This involved complete Soviet domination of the area already under Communist control, the shift of Communist parties from coalitm' to opposition in other areas, the instigation of Communist outbreaks 1 \"colonial\" areas (especially in the Far East), and the expulsion of «\" Western Powers from their enclave in Berlin. All this was to be achieve while avoiding an open clash with the United States. As part of thi process, which was badly bungled everywhere except in Czechoslovak'' 1 ' the Communists withdrew from the \"bourgeois\" coalition governnien which they had joined in 1944-1945: in Belgium in March 1947, in Franc and Italy in May, and in Austria in the autumn. At the same time, agitation from Communist-dominated trade unions was increased, an the first postwar large-scale strikes began at the end of the year. As p ar of this same harassment, the Soviet Union in the UN vetoed applications for membership by Italy and Finland. In the states already under Communist control, the Soviet influen c was intensified by efforts to establish a system in w hich the local par- ties and secret police were controlled by Soviet agents in the Russia embassies. As part of this effort, the Third International, or Cominter , which had been dissolved in theory by Stalin in December 1943 (but n continued to operate secretly out of Moscow), was reestablished uf fl the new name \"Cominform.\" This was done under Zhdanov's directio at a meeting of representatives of the Communist parties of France, ' ta /' Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Czechoslovak- held in Poland in September 1947.

The Soviet effort to obtain operational control of the party in Yugo- slavia was vigorously resisted by Tito. As a final effort in this direction, Stalin in February 1948 tried to force Yugoslavia into a federation with more docile Bulgaria. Tito flatly refused. As a result, Yugoslavia was ex- pelled from the Cominform in June 1948, and all-out economic, propa- ganda, ideological, and political warfare was begun by the Soviet bloc a gainst Tito. The conflict was used by Stalin as an excuse to purge all °Ppositionist Communists within the bloc as \"Titoists.\" As part of this strugg]^ Tito closed the Yugoslav border to the Greek guerrillas, with the result that they, with General Markos, ended their disturbances in '949> and Tito became a recipient of American economic aid which eventually reached $700 million. This process reached its climax with the achievement of a Greek-Yugoslav alliance in 1954. A parallel effort by Stalin to take Czechoslovakia completely into the Communist camp was more successful, and was, in fact, the most suc- cessful of his numerous efforts to increase his power in the last six years °' his life. In Czechoslovakia the Russian-trained Communist Klement ^ottwald had become prime minister in a coalition government in July '946. In February 1948, the Communist minister of the interior replaced e 'ght Prague police officials by Communists, was overruled by the Cab- lnet , but refused to back down, calling out into the streets the workers' rn \"itia, armed factory workers, and the police (all three under Commu- nis t control) to sustain his refusal. When the non-Communist ministers protested and some threatened to resign, Gottwald threatened the ill \"resident Benes with civil war if he did not dismiss twelve non-Commu- nis t ministers. Benes, who had been determined to seek support from Russia and not from the Western Powers since his unhappy disillusion- ment with the latter at Munich in September 1938, yielded to Gottwald's demands on February 25, 1948; he himself resigned on May 4th and died in September 1948. His friend, Foreign Minister Jan Masaryk, son of the \"under of Czechoslovakia, and the chief Czech advocate of a pro- vestern policy, died mysteriously by a fall from a window on May 10th. \"e Communist control of Czechoslovakia was then complete. Stalin's victory in Czechoslovakia was followed by an even more dra- matic defeat, in an effort to eject the United States, France, and Britain r °ni their sectors in West Berlin. Apparently he believed that the United ktatcs was considering a withdrawal from Berlin and that a Soviet push v °uld hasten that event. The former belief may have been based on good evidence, but the latter inference from it was quite mistaken.

Two decisions left unsolved were whether Germany would be broken up and how reparations mig nt: be obtained from her without building the country up economically to provide these. Efforts by the State Department to settle these questions were blocked by other departments, notably by the Civil Affairs Division of the War Department, which wanted them left unsettled, and by the Treasurv Department, which had totallv different aims from State. In a farsighted message from London in August 1944, Ambassador John Winant warned that lack of an agreed reparations policy would in- evitably lead to a breakdown of joint Allied control of Germany and to a struggle with Russia for control of Germany. These wise words were ignored, and President Roosevelt, to stop the bickering, postponed all decisions. Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau took advantage 01 this lacuna and of his close personal friendship with Roosevelt to pus' 1 forward his own pet scheme to reduce Germany to a purely agricul- tural state by almost total destruction of her industry, the millions or surplus population to be, if necessary, deported to Africa! The secretary* supported by his assistant secretary, Harry Dexter White, was deeply disturbed by Germany's history of aggression and by her efforts to an- nihilate other \"races,\" and was fairly certain that an American relapse into isolationism would make it possible for Germany to try again. T ne only way to prevent such an attempt, he felt, was to reduce Germany industry, and thus her warmaking capacity, as close to nothing as p oS \" sible. The resulting chaos, inflation, and misery would be but slight re- payment for the horrors Germany had inflicted on others over many years. By personal influence Morgenthau obtained acceptance of a some- what modified version of this plan by both Roosevelt and Churchill a the Quebec Conference of September 1944. There is little doubt tna Churchill's approval had been won by his scientific adviser, Lord Cher- well, who had personal animosities against Germany and had been w chief civilian advocate of indiscriminate bombing of German cities. The error at Quebec was quickly repudiated, but no real planning w a done, and the Morgenthau Plan played a considerable role in JCS io°7> the directive set up to guide the American military occupation of Ger- many.

Much of the coun- r .V wa s still in ruins, housing was lacking, production of food and,coal ere in almost total collapse, unemployment was very high, inflation was a mpant, crime (especially from bands of displaced persons, ex-Nazis, n \" juvenile delinquents) was widespread, and the black market, using ] g a tettes as a monetary standard, was flourishing.

By the end of 1947, the Ameri- ans and British were thoroughly tired of paying astronomical sums each / e ar to keep food flowing to western Germany. All efforts to make an °nomic reunion with eastern Germany failed because of Soviet in- stence that such a reestablishment of interchange of food for industrial P °ducts between the two halves of Germany must be tied in with rec °gnition of renewed Soviet claims for $10 billion in reparation pay- en ts to be taken from current production, two points which had been settled by the wartime agreements. , ° revive German industry so that it could pay for imports of food, e Anglo-Americans devised a reform of the German currency.

The Soviet Union used the monetary reform in West Germany as an excuse for its blockade of Berlin which lasted in extreme form fr orn June 24, 1948, to May 12, 1949 (although it had begun, on a partial basis, on March 31st). It began in an atmosphere of rapidly rising EaSt-W es tension. In December 1947, the King of Romania was forced into abdica- tion and exile. Shortly after the new year, the SED in East Germany waS purged of any leaders likely to show independence toward Stalin. 1 n Czech takeover in February 1948 was preceded by Soviet invitations Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Finland to sign military alliances W Russia.

The new constitution of January 1948, required a new election during which the fate of newlv democratic Italy hung in the balance. The results were a great defeat for the Con munists, who obtained only 182 seats in their Popular Front alliance w the Left-wing Socialists, compared to 307 Christian Democrat mem» in the Assembly of 570 seats.

Rail, canal, road, and air traffic to the west were un- ^er Soviet control and were constantly harassed by shifting regulations, \"clays, and open obstacles. By the early months of 1948, rail and road r °utes were tied in knots, and air traffic along the recognized corridor ^ Vi) s jeopardized by trespassing Soviet fighter planes, intruding barrage Walloons, and unannounced aircraft gunfire.

The West German elections 0 August 14, 1949, gave the Christian Democrats 31 percent of the vote, with 139 seats in the Parliament. The chief opposition party, the Socia Democratic, had 29 percent, with 131 seats.

In fact, the victory of Mao Tse-tung in China was not encouraged, ex pected, or notably assisted by Moscow. Stalin was like a shrewd old wolf of the north Siberian forest. Under- standing nothing outside his own experience, he never forgot what had a Ppened to himself. Stalin had been involved once before, in 1927, in ^n effort to communize China, and had failed disastrously in the attempt. ^° w : in the wake of World War II, he had no desire to repeat that asco. What he wanted in the Far East is not clear, but it seems evident fat he wanted a weak China surrounded bv small states in which Amer- Ca n influence was minimal. Such a weak China could be guaranteed by °ntinued rule under the Nationalist government, possibly with the Com- munists playing a role in a coalition, as the United States seemed to wish, nrough such a weak and divided China, Stalin could anticipate no re at to himself either from American efforts or from China itself. To educe the danger of either of these alternatives, Stalin would have wel- ^ed Communist or largely Communist regimes in Japan, Korea, south- ast Asia, and Indonesia, with an autonomous or independent Communist inese regime in control of northwestern China, and possibly even Man- 1 uria, as a buffer to the Soviet Union's own territory. At the end of the war in the Far East in 1945, it was clear to most ob- tvers that Roosevelt's pretense that Nationalist China was a great Power, e his equally confused pretense that France was not a significant Ower, was mistaken. China's war effort against Japan weakened fairlv eadily from Pearl Harbor to the end. This decline resulted, verv largely, ° m t he almost total corruption of the regime, which left the Chinese r asant in sullen discontent and roused open disfavor among manv urban o °ups, notably students.

In the two years following the defeat of Japan, IM3 million in American assistance to China vanished in one way or anotn and at the end the Chinese Army and the Chiang regime was weaker tna ever. In spite of this weakness and waste, the Nationalist government f e fused to obev American advice either to reform or simply to consolida itself in the parts of China it still controlled. It was determined to destroy the Communist regime, especially when Mao began to take steps to co solidate the buffer area which he and Stalin wished to establish in nort western and northern China. This determination became a panic to pr vent the Russian forces in Manchuria from turning over that rich area the Communist units. The Soviet forces there, after looting the area u der the guise of reparations from Japan, began to withdraw early in I0 4 ' By a simple process of informing Mao and not informing Chiang their withdrawal schedules, they ensured that the abandoned areas shou be occupied immediately by Communist forces.

Unfortunately, this was just the period in which the Communists were expanding their forces with captured Japanese arms obtained from the Russians and with large acquisition of earlier American arms shipments to the Nationalists which were corruptly allowed to go to the Reds. To stop this and to stop the Wastage of Nationalist troops by incompetent leadership, it would ave been necessary to allot at least 10,000 American officers to Chiang's forces, attached to every unit down to company level. Neither side Wanted to do this, as the problems of language translation, of inability to enforce recommendations, or to overcome personal Chinese resentment . a gainst such interference by foreigners were almost insuperable. Marshall, in 1946, became convinced that the Nationalist regime was opeless and that it could overcome the Communists only if the United tates took actual control by American personnel and fought the Com- munists with American troops.

For this e ason, the first announcement came from Winston Churchill in his P e ech in Fulton, Missouri, in June 1946.

It was also British initiative over Greece and Turkey at the nd of the year which led to the \"Truman Doctrine\" of March 1947. ir uman could not get any constructive help from the leaders of the me d forces in establishing a new strategy (they were much too busy gnting each other in protection of the vested interests surviving from °nd War II), so he was forced to fall back on other forms of re- . ance, particularly economic, diplomatic, and ideological. The result- S strategy is known as \"containment.\" It lasted from early 1947 to 953, and was resumed gradually after 1958.

As early as August 1945, Truman asked the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JGS) draw up recommendations for America's postwar security needs.

The navy in 1945 was much larger than all other navies of the won combined—\"a five-ocean navv to fight a no-ocean opponent,\" said n air force—but its future had been placed in great jeopardy by the atom- .bomb tests staged at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific in 1946. These tests show* that a fleet would suffer verv great damage, unless widely dispersed, n° atomic explosions in the air, while a blast under water would dref> c it with almost irradicable radioactivity.

The armv, almost eclipsed by the plans of its more glamorous riva \"' wanted Universal Military Training (UMT) leading to highly trair> e reserve units, in spite of the air force's insistence that World War would be over before ground forces could be mobilized. These disagreements between services made it impossible for the J to achieve any agreement on strategv or on weapons needs in answer Truman's request of 1945. Accordingly, in June 1946, they informed t President that a unified strategy could be reached only after achievcm of a unification of the three services into a single organization. For t reason, it was not until April 1950, that the United States obtained strategic military policv to underlie Truman's policy of containnic which was then three years old. The new strategic policy was enibodi in NSC 68, which, despite its code identification, did not come from l National Security Council, but was the child of the Policy Planning Staff of the State Department, led by Paul Nitze.

In this reorganization there were at least three major parts: (1) unification of the armed services; ' 2 ) creation of the National Security Council as an advisory board to the President; and (3) reorganization of the whole system of intel- 'gence and spying, through the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and tf ie code-breaking National Security Agency (NSA). Basically, rivalry among the American armed services was a rivalry °r congressional appropriations, a struggle over slicing the annual budget. h this struggle each service sought to convince congressmen that its Particular weapons provided the best defense for the United States. The air force, which in 1946 was still a branch of the armv, touted the claims or the manned bomber; the navy, only recently disillusioned with its old ov e, the battleship, had now shifted its affections to the aircraft carrier; ' e army had to stick with the humble foot soldier but almost concealed llrn from view with its insistence on trucks, tanks, and cannon. As a \"latter of f act , the manned bomber, the aircraft carrier, and the tank er e all obsolescent in 1946, but their supporters were unwilling to 0l icede this, since such a concession would, they thought, shift appro- bations to the other services. The manned bomber was threatened }' rockets with homing devices which would bring such rockets, at Peeds higher than manned bombers could ever reach, in for the kill by eking out the plane's engine exhaust heat or by use of radar and elec- °nic-eye devices. The aircraft carrier was threatened by atomic bombs, nc e it W as too vulnerable to these to justify its cost of over $100 Wion. The tank was threatened bv shaped charges, and, in general, the \"O'e tactical outlook of ground forces, with their traditional emphasis \" mass and concentration, was challenged by nuclear, biological, and e mical weapons which put great value on dispersal. ln these struggles between the sen-ices, the clashes are particularly bit- in a period of demobilization, and this bitterness is accentuated bv the ct that each service has alliances with the industrial complexes which SU Pply their equipment. These complexes not only supply funds, such advertising, for each service to carry its message to the Congress and . People, but also exert everv influence to retain equipment and tac- s in obsolescent modes and types (but newer models) by dangling, 0r e the high officers who can influence contracts, offers of future well- j~ >mg consultant positions with the industrial firms concerned. .Most \"'gri officers of the American armed forces in the war and postwar period •red before the fixed age of sixty-two, often on a disability basis (which"},{"pageNumber":927,"pageContent":"9 r 2  TRAGEDY AND HOPE exempted retirement pay from income taxes), and then took consultant jobs with industrial firms whose chief business was in war contracts. Thus, four-star general Brehon B. Somervell, chief of Army Service Forces in World War II, retired on a disability salary of $16,000 a year at the age of fifty-four to join a number of industrial firms, including Koppers, which paid him $125,000 a year; three-star general L. H. Camp- bell, chief of ordnance in World War II,-retired on disability at $9,000 a year at age fifty-nine and became an executive, at $50,000 a year, <& firms from whom he had previously purchased $3 billion in armaments. Four-star General Clay retired at fifty-two on $16,000 a year, but signed up at once with General Motors and Continental Can at over $100,000 a year. Three-star air-force General Ira C. Eaker left the service at age fifty with $9,000 a year and joined Hughes Tool Company at $50,000. Another three-star air-force general, Harold C. George, went with Eaker to Hughes, at $40,000. General Joseph T. McNarney, in 1952, took his four stars, and $16,000 a year, to join Consolidated Vultee at $100,000. These are but a few of more than a hundred general officers whose postretirement alliances with industrial firms encouraged their successors, still on active service, to remain on friendly terms with such appreciative business corporations. These connections undoubtedly inhibit officers o the armed services in their efforts to obtain fresh ideas, fresh tactics, an fresh equipment for America's defense. In this struggle there occurs rivalry between the services to secure larger shares of existing budgets, but there also occurs cooperation increase the total joint budget. The best way to do the latter is by wa scares, which undoubtedly increase appropriations for all services. A spectacular increase in the joint defense budget of the United States fro about $14 billion in the late i94o's to about $60 billion in the ear, 1960's is partly caused by a real Soviet threat to the United States, but 1 is also partly caused by a scare engendered by the armed services, the Soviet Union has been deterred from aggression by those expen Cures, the money was well spent, but, since the Soviet Union never had any intention of engaging the United States in open war, > r legitimate to believe that many of the billions spent could have oe used to fight the Soviet Union in more remunerative ways than by purchase of manned bombers, aircraft carriers, or tanks.

The air force was interested only in strategic bombing, and had 'We interest in tactical work under command of ground forces which, e flyers insisted, hampered their special genius. To get free of the army and become a separate service, coequal with the navy and army, the army air f° r ces in 1946 put their full pressure behind legislation to \"unify\" the armed services. \"Unify\" here really meant change two into three. This 'as done by reducing the two Cabinet posts for war and navy to a n g le post for defense, with three equal secretaries for army, navy, and \"\" outside the Cabinet. The \"unity\" presumably was to be obtained from e secretary of defense's control over the three service secretaries, but ls Was impossible since they were named by the President, not by the ec retary of defense, and they had little influence over their services, each ot which looked to its chief commander on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. * ft e fact that the Joint Chiefs had operational command of their de- partments meant that they had to defend the diverse interests of these, and °uid contribute little to unity or to any general ideas, even strategic ones; \"ile if they had been separated from their actual commands in order to e *ree to reach a general consensus on strategic ideas they would have gained no control over their services. The only real lines of authority in e whole system were those in the hands of the President himself and 0s e lines of command going downward from the Joint Chiefs to their *n services. There were only very weak fines between the secretary of e »ense and the Joint Chiefs or to his service secretaries, or between the ter and the services for which they were responsible. As a result, very le unification was achieved, even after amendments to the Act, and in 949 the interservice rivalries reached their most intense peak. By the of that year UMT, the supercarrier, and the 70-group air force were oead, killed off by interservice rivalries, in spite of the fact that all r ohc-opinion polls showed strong support for all of them. James Forrestal, who had been secretary of the navy since 1944, and \"°> on behalf of the navy, had emasculated the unification bill, was a oe first secretary of defense, and was called upon to administer it in 947- Within a year he had reversed his opinions and was demanding me ndments to strengthen the Act, especially the powers of his own \" st ; His mind collapsed under the strain, and he resigned in 1949, com- itting suicide shortly afterward.

Al- though the supercarrier had been authorized and appropriated for, and although construction had begun under Forrestal, Johnson used a vote of two to one in JCS against it (Admiral Louis Denfeld in the minority) as excuse for canceling the contract. The subsequent \"Admirals' Revolt took the form of anonymous letters to Congress charging corruption 0 the B-36 contract, as well as public charges, which were quite correct, that the plane was already obsolete. The whole scandal received a i ul \" scale congressional investigation, the \"B-36 affair,\" as a result of whici the B-36 was discredited, Admiral Denfeld was removed from the JCS, and Johnson, having alienated everyone by his efforts to save money, * a replaced by General Marshall (1950). The Unification Act had excluded retired officers from the post 0 secretary of defense, but this clause was made unapplicable to Genera Marshall so that he could succeed Johnson in 1950. Thus, the supporter of each of the three services held the position successively in less than two-year period. Marshall said that he took the job to get UMT, but tn act, as passed in 1951, was in a form which allowed the Administration prevent its execution, and it never went into effect. In its place, troop were raised for the services, chiefly the army, by successive extensions 0 the wholly unsatisfactory Selective Service Acts. The interservice battles of 1945-1950 were largely a victory for the ai force, which got rid of the supercarrier and UMT, and thus obtained 11 biggest bite from the budget. Much of this bite went to SAC, which na been created in March 1946, and was taken over from General George Kenney by General Curtis E. LeMay in October 1948. At the time, SAC was really SAD. Starting in 1946 with only a single group able deliver the atom bomb, for most of this period it struggled along wi n the 300-mph B-29. \"It lacked planes, bases, equipment, and trained men- Above all, it still operated on the old premise that the outbreak of * would be preceded by negotiations and mobilization.

This was done bv setting up a structure of officers and Uxiliary activities which absorbed almost the total budget of the depart- ment in noncombat lines and filled the combat units with a small number short-term draftees of very little combat value. In January 1952, for • Xa mple, the Department of Defense had 5 million employees, of which >7 million were in uniform and 1.3 million were civilians. Those in uni- orni used up $37 billion for pay, food, housing, and clothing—that is, . IO '°°o per head—in a total defense budget of $46 billion. The 1.3 million lv 'ilians cost $5.2 billion, or $4,000 a year each, leaving only $3 billion the total defense budget for equipment, research, and other costs which °ntribute directly to defense. The army's share of the 3.7 million uni- ted personnel was 2 million, but that provided only 12 divisions, at ost 150,000 men, for combat. ln spite of these enormous expeditures, the puny combat effectiveness the \"standing army\" was shown in the Korean War when nine-tenths the officers in combat were Reserves who had to be called from their r acetinie activities to fight. The army solution to the disappointments Korea was more of the same; in June 1951, the Selective Service Act of 94° was amended to drop the draft age from 19 to 18 and raise the horized limit on the men in active service from over 2 million to 5 ' \"On.

In Feb- ruary 1952, Greece and Turkey joined the pact, and in May 1955 the Wes German Federal Republic became a member. The agreement was largely anchored on Germany: it flowed out of the threat provided by the Berlin blockade, and directly implied the merging of West Germany into tn Western camp. As the chief step in this process, the three western zones of Germany were merged into one, and, in September 1949, the military rule of Germany* was replaced by the Adenauer regime. Throughout this period, fear of communism was growing within tn United States. The real threat, if any, behind this fear is still uncertain- The Soviet and Communist hatred of the American way of life is *^j established, and the existence of the American Communist Party as a Wl ing tool of an international Communist conspiracy directed from Mosco\"- is also beyond dispute. Such Communists were undoubtedly engaged 1 subversion and espionage, and were assisted in these efforts by \"feU° travelers\" and other sympathizers. Moreover, some Communists and felloe travelers were undoubtedly present in government and, to a gre at degree, in some other areas, notably certain labor unions, higher educatio , and especially in the more creative end of the entertainment field, sue as the theater, writing, and Hollywood scenario production. On the otne hand, the number of Communists in the United States, according to t FBI, was only about 75,000 in 1945 and fell steadily to 50,000 in i°5 and to 3,000 in i960.    ,    It is still impossible to make any real assessment of the influence Communists, either in government or out of it, in the period of 1949\" 1950 with which we are now concerned; this is equally true of the ear 1 years, going back to 1933, with which most of the charges and counte charges made in 1949 were concerned. The chief reason for this is 1 secrecy, which still prevails, was used by both sides to portray, by seie five publicity, a false picture. Falsehood, manipulation, selection, and o' cially tortion of evidence were prevalent on both sides, and were used especi by the anti-Communists, not because they were less addicted to the tr urn ho than Communists, but because they, on the offensive, were the ones Vf were raising the issues, and exposing the evidence.

Com- unist insistence that something be done about these things won \\vide- Pread sympathy, even in circles which were totallv non-Communist. ^ Communists themselves took full advantage of this atmosphere by ^abashing Communist front and fellow-traveler organizations of all \"ids, and the distinction between party members and fellow travelers came very free, confused, and blurred. The Communist command > s tem, however, remained fully aware of who were devoted to their P finanent goals and who were not, and retained general control, under 0Ve r, of all organizations thev regarded as important. . . * \"is ambiguous situation of Left-wing fellowship began to break down '938-1040 as the complete dominance of Soviet national selfishness tru u Communist parties everywhere became evident, at first in Spain, '' er m the Nazi-Soviet Pact of August 1939, and in the Soviet-Finnish a* the following winter. or the American Communist Party the chief turning point here was e enactment of the Foreign Agents Registration Act in 1940. The 'nted States Communist Party broke its affiliation with the Comintern \"istcad established a secret link between the Comintern and the n 'ted States party, chiefly through Gerhart Eisler (who was finally Ported in 1049 and became an official of the East German Communist S'tne). { n IQ ^ the Comintern itself was officially dissolved by the soviet Go vernment, although secretly it continued to exist. As part of . same process, in a sort of wartime common front, the United States |~ v itself was dissolved in 1944 an ^ reappeared at once as the Corn- rust Political Association. Earl Browder, who personified the Popular . nt tactic of the IQJO'S, continued as the head of the Political Asso- eiaK °n and the common-front tactic until July 1945, when he was re- \\Vi • as a tra ' ror to tne Marxist-Leninist ideology and replaced by ' llar n Z.

At the same time, the Communist Partv of the United es Was reestablished to pursue a more aggressive and narrower policy."},{"pageNumber":933,"pageContent":"918  TRAGEDY AND HOPE The abandonment of the United Front approach in 1945 was a gr osS tactical error which almost totally destroyed the party in the next fifteen years. It had been ordered from Moscow through the French Communis leader, Jacques Duclos, and was, like other mistakes of the Kremlin at the same time, based on a totally mistaken conception of what the postwa world would be like. This misconception was firmly rooted in the greate misconceptions of Marxist-Leninist doctrine, and assumed (1) that ther would be a postwar economic depression; (2) that the United S tate would relapse into isolationism; and (3) that the United States an Europe, especially Britain, would engage in an imperialist rivalry i° markets and economic advantages. Just as the new Soviet foreign polic) prepared to exploit this anticipated chaos, so the CPUS was reorganize to profit from the same chaos. Instead, it committed suicide. This collapse of the CPUS from 75,000 members with ample funds 1 1945 to less than 3,000 members with hardly a dime fifteen years later va assisted by the actions of the United States government, the attacks 0 party members who were leaving it in droves, and the efforts 01 ex members, political leaders, and intellectual bellwethers to strike at t CPUS in substitute for their inability to strike at the USSR. Many ot these virtuous warriors were fighting for their convictions, but at lea an equally large number were fighting for their personal profit or tne personal partisan advantage. In this effort to win personal advantag from a worthy struggle, leadership was taken by some of the ex-Co 1 \" munists, the FBI, and the House Committee on Un-American Activity • These anti-Communists, some of them professionals, tried to deffl° strate that the CPUS, by its penetration into the Federal governme' 1 under the New Deal, into labor unions or education, and into entertai ment, especially Hollywood, had gravely endangered the nation. On whole, from the perspective of decades, these charges, concerned V the period before 1945, seem grossly exaggerated. On the other hand, making of these charges in the period 1947-1955 was very damaging the country. The influence of Communists, within or outside governnie bad been slight. It is, for example, almost impossible to find a sing motion picture, book, or play which can be identified as having \\ influence in leading Americans to feel favorably toward a Comniu system for this country. It is even difficult to find examples of such effort. On the other hand, it is possible to find examples of books Vt jj gave a too favorable impression of the Soviet Union, just as it is p oSS to find favorable books on any country, including Tibet, Peron's Arg tina, Castro's Cuba, or Trujillo's Dominican Republic. Some of n favorable books on the USSR, such as Lord and Lady Passfield's S 0 ' 1 \"' Communism: A New Civilization? (1935) or Albert Rhys Wi» ian The Soviets (A Book-of-the-Month Club recommendation in '93*'! undoubtedly had influence in establishing an unduly favorable picture"},{"pageNumber":934,"pageContent":"NUCLEAR RIVALRY AND THE COLD WAR: 1945-1950 919 Soviet life, but their influence could not in any way compare, in strengthening Communism in the United States, with the influence in that direction exercised by the breakdown of the capitalist laissez-faire economy in 1929-1939, or with the failure of the democratic countries to st and up to Fascist aggression in Germany, Italy, and Spain in that same decade. Espionage is another matter, but this is more from the nature of es pionage than the nature of Communism, except for the very significant tact that the ideological appeal of Communism to the half educated makes 11 possible for the Soviet Union to obtain secrets without financial pay- ments. In general, the nature of espionage is totally ignored by most P e ople, and this ignorance was only increased by the activities of the an ti-Communist spy agitations of the 1949-1954 period. All past history hows that espionage has been generally successful and intelligence has e en generally a failure. By this I mean that no country had much suc- Ce ss in keeping secrets, in the twentieth as in all earlier centuries, but \"either has any other country had much success in evaluating or in mterpreting the secrets it obtained. The so-called \"surprises\" of history ave emerged not because other countries did not have the information ut because they refused to believe it. The date of Hitler's attack on the es t in May 1940 had been given to the Netherlands by the German ° u nterintelligence Office as soon as it was decided; the Western coun- les refused to believe it. The same was true of every one of Hitler's fprises. Stalin was given the date of the German attack on the Soviet n 'on by a number of informants, including the United States Depart- ent of State, but he refused to believe. Both the Germans and the Rus- 'ais had the date of D-Day, but ignored it. The United States had avail- e all the Japanese coded messages, knew that war was about to begin, that a Japanese fleet with at least four large carriers was loose (and ) in the Pacific, yet Pearl Harbor was a total surprise. This last point s so h arc j to believe, once the evidence was available, that the same o u ps who were howling about Soviet espionage in 1948-195 5 were ° claiming that President Roosevelt expected and wanted Pearl Harbor. h these beliefs, if they were believed, were based on gigantic ignorance ^conceptions about the nature of intelligence. . he whole purpose of secrecy in government should not be to keep °tniation from other states (this is almost impossible) but to make it , lf ficult as possible for other states to get certain information, so that, n they do get such restricted information, it will be so intermingled other information and misinformation that it cannot be evaluated iiptly enough to do them much good. Any espionage system gets e ^formation than it can handle rapidly. Any country should as- e that the enemy has all its own secret information. The lessons of past r y fully support this assumption. Following every war the discovery"},{"pageNumber":935,"pageContent":"920  TRAGEDY AND HOPE is made that the enemy, during the war, had every other state's most cherished secrets. In fact, the most successful kind of counterespionage work is achieved, not by preventing access to secrets, but by permitting access to information which is not true. This was done most successfully in 1943 in preparing the American invasion of Sicily, which was a sur- prise to the Germans because they had been provided, through their espionage in Spain, with false information about an invasion of the Balkans. The Germans had a somewhat similar success through thei Operation North Pole by which the Germans successfully took over an operated the French Underground and the associated British espionage net in a large part of France for about a year. Finally, it is not generally recognized by outsiders that almost all the information gathered by any espionage net is nonsecret material fully available to anyone as pub' 1 information. Even in work against a supersecret area like the Sovie Union or in nuclear \"secrets\" this is true. Allen Dulles said that more than 90 percent of the information which the CIA gathers on the Soviet Unio is nonsecret. Soviet espionage reports on the United States must con tain at least 97 percent nonsecret material. Many, if not most, of the \"spies\" and \"atomic spies\" apprehended, wit high-powered publicitv, by the FBI and the Un-American Activities Com- mittee in 1948-1954 (to the great alarm of the American people) wer not concerned with secrets, while some of them were not engaged espionage at all, and almost none of them had anything to do with nucie secrets (contrary to the publicity releases of the agencies who accus them). There was nuclear espionage, and it was successful, but aim nothing was achieved by any spv chasers in the United States either reveal the culprits or to punish them. Fuchs and Nunn May w real nuclear spies for the Soviet, but others at least equally important hardly ever mentioned. For example, Frederic Joliot-Curie, the g rea French nuclear physicist (Nobel Prize, 1935) and an admitted men 1 of the Communist Party, knew as much about our nuclear work as any in Europe, Britain, or Canada. His chief associates fled from France \\ did not) in 1940 and worked on the nuclear project in England ano Canada until thev returned to France after that country's libera Some of these associates, notably Hans von Halban and Lew Kowa certainly knew as much as Nunn May and may have known as muc Fuchs, and unquestionably told all they knew to Joliot-Curie, a ^ munist, in 1944. Or again, as an example of numerous unexplored pat J which nuclear information went to Russia, an outstanding Polish nuc . phvsicisr who studied with Joliot-Curie was Ignace Zlotowski. He the United States in the critical years during the Soviet race to ma* ^ atom bomb as a member of the Polish Embassy staff and Poland s rep sentative on the UN Atomic Energy Commission. He sent large q ^ tities of nuclear information behind the Iron Curtain and was prese an observer at the Bikini bomb tests in 1946."},{"pageNumber":936,"pageContent":"NUCLEAR RIVALRY AND THE COLD WAR: I945-I95O Q2I finally, it is evident that a great deal of nuclear information (whether secret or not is unknown), as well as uranium metal, went to the Soviet Union as part of Lend-Lease in 1943. iMajor George Racey Jordan, U ^AAF, tried in vain to disrupt these shipments at the time. While most °t Jordan's evidence is unreliable, the shipment of uranium to Russia is °rroborated from other sources. The significance of such shipments is \"' unknown, since the export license permitting them was granted at \" e request of General Groves. Jordan's other evidence, most of which ^as very discreditable to the New Deal (since he testified that he, roves, and others were under direct pressure from Harry Hopkins and 1Ce \"Ptesident Henry Wallace to allow export of nuclear materials, radar, • nd other secrets to Russia) was subsequently shown to be false, yet all ls statements were given nationwide publicity by news commentators «ke Fulton Lewis, Jr., by Life magazine, and by the House Un-American Activities Committee, and are still widely believed. Most of the \"atomic spy\" cases are similar to this. The earliest of these a s the arrest of Soviet naval Lieutenant Redin by the FBI on March 26, 946, on charges that a Seattle naval engineer, Herbert Kennedy, had ^'d Redin \"secrets\" about the Bikini test ship Yellowstone for $250. \"•s case was a forerunner of others in respect to two false assertions in evvs releases: (1) claims by the FBI that information leading to the iPprehension of Redin had come from the Gouzenko \"atomic spy\" case in Canada (February 1946) and (2) claims by the HUAC that it had un- shed this significant case. Redin was eventually acquitted when his ense showed that Kennedy had been paid for research he did for Kedin i n the Seattle Public Library. Neither Gouzenko nor HUAC had an ything to do with it. . the change in the climate of American opinion (and thus in the at- u des of American juries) over four years may be observed in the or itrast between the acquittal of Redin in 1946 and the conviction of \"raham Brothman in 1950. The FBI publicity and the universal belief the American press, both at Brothman's arrest in July 1950 and at his la ' m November 1950, Mas that he was \"part of a Soviet spy apparatus \"der a Russian trade organization chief working to ferret out atomic [( Cre ts\" (The New York Tivies, July 30, 1950) or that the trial was an -ATOMIC SPY CASE\" (all New York newspaper headlines, November ~~ 2 h '950). In fact, Brothman and his secretary (.Miss Moskowitz) were le only defendants in a trial for conspiracv to persuade a third person, °t on trial (Harry Gold), to commit perjury in July 1947.

In spite of the"},{"pageNumber":937,"pageContent":"922  TRAGEDY AND HOPE fact that the trial clearly showed that Brothman had nothing to do witn espionage, secrets, or atomic research, the mistaken impression that he di was never removed by the press, and remained in the public mind as an established truth, so that United States Attorney Irving Saypol, vV ' n0 prosecuted this case in November 1950, referred to Brothman as con- victed of \"espio?iage\" when he prosecuted the Rosenberg case before tn same judge in April 1951. The true story, as far as Brothman was con- cerned, seems to be quite different. Brothman was an industrial chemist and chemical inventor who owne a number of chemical laboratories and factories held as subsidiaries or W Pennsylvania Sugar Company. His chief concern was in industry solvents in which he held patents on processes and equipment. In i94 0 ' when Brothman was seeking orders for his products, he was approach^ by a Russian, Jacob Golos, then proprietor of World Tourists, a Corn- munist-front travel agencv but previously employed by the Soviet Tra Commission (A.MTORG) and its Purchasing Commission. Brothman of- fered Golos 10 percent commission on any orders he could place vvi either agencv for Brothman's products or processes. We now know tn - Golos was a high official in the Soviet secret police, a major Soviet sp, > and one of the three-man Control Commission of the American Com munist Party. Brothman knew none of this and was not himself a Corn munist, although in 1940 he regarded the Soviet Union as the chief 0 stacle to world Fascism.    ,    For several months in 1940, Brothman gave to Golos, both directly 3n through Golos's mistress, Elizabeth Bentley, blueprints and descriptions 0 the chemical processes he had for sale. All of these were available to a prospective purchaser and had been written up and advertised by Bro man in the regular chemical journals, and many were his own inve tions. When Brothman objected to talking to Golos or Miss Bentley on ground that they knew no chemistry, Golos sent him another age' 11 ' chemist, Harry Gold, who had been doing industrial research (M# J gradually developed into industrial espionage) for AMTORG for seve years. Although Brothman got little or no business from the Russians, hired Gold as a chemist in one of his laboratories in 1943- Four V e later, after Gold, unknown to Brothman, had become an atomic spy c tact with Fuchs, Brothman discussed with his secretary how GO testimony before a grand jury might be given to prevent unfavorable in ences regarding Brothman's contacts with Golos in 1940. In view of changed American attitude toward such Russian contacts from '94° 1947, this is not, perhaps, a surprising reaction, but in the increasi g 7 tense situation of 1950 it won Brothman a seven-year prison sentence conspiring with his secretary to persuade Gold to commit perjury- ( was not tried either for the conspiracy or for perjury.) The changed atmosphere of American public opinion from '94/"},{"pageNumber":938,"pageContent":"NUCLEAR RIVALRY AND THE COLD WAR: 1945-1950 923 Was greatly intensified by the increasingly strained world conditions, and )' the growing public knowledge of the nature of the Communist Movement, its connections with Soviet Russia, and their joint conspiracy against the West. Much of this evidence came from ex-Communists, such as Elizabeth Bentley, Louis Budenz, Whittaker Chambers, John Lautner, an d others. All of these undoubtedly were ex-Communists and, equally undoubtedly, revealed much valuable information about the Communist conspiracy and properly roused the American public to the danger of this conspiracy. But it is equally true that the first three names mentioned ar c known and remembered because they dramatized, distorted, and Manipulated, (consciously or unconsciously) evidence for their own private purposes. This is particularly true of Elizabeth Bentlev and Louis \"Uuenz, both of whom exaggerated their previous roles in the Com- •nunist Party, were very ignorant of the real nature and significance of ne ir own evidence (or of any evidence), knew very little that was not based on hearsay\" (often at second or third hand), and undoubtedly em- roidered and manipulated their evidence for their private profit. Budenz, who was \"managing editor\" (really copy editor) of the Communist news- P a per the Daily Worker from 1941 to 1945, carefully planned his with- rawal from the party to protect his own interests. His decision was made arly in 1945; he arranged for a position on the faculty of Notre Dame University at the end of September, obtained his weekly pay in advance torn the Daily Worker for the second week of October, left the paper an \" the party on October nth, and joined the Notre Dame faculty two a >'s later. In the next eight years, in addition to his salary, he received gross earnings of $70,000 as a professional ex-Communist lecturer and Writer. ' his is certainly legitimate, but it is obvious that Budenz, in order to etain his value in this specialized market, had to continue to produce ew evidence if not new sensations. Much of this evidence, released over e Vears, became more remote from his personal knowledge or even r °rn the facts. This is, for example, very clear in his efforts to show that Tierican foreign policy in China was controlled, determined, or in- Ue nced by persons whom he called \"Communists.\" Miss Bentley's profiting from her role of ex-Communist was much less Rrtimate, as can be seen from one example. Early in 1950, when Miss cntley's position was, in money and reputation, precarious, and her \"ghteen months of successful notoriety as an informer seemed to be ' Pproaching eclipse, she signed a contract with Devin-Adair for an ' u tobiog ni p| lv to be written with the editorial assistance of John Brunini, wh< Would also share in the royalties.

John Brunini, who was to share the profits of .Miss Bentley's book, was foreman of the grand jury which indicted Remington for perjury a few weeks later (May 1950) for testi- fying he had not been a Communist. The evidence that he was, given be- fore the grand jury headed bv Brunini, came from Miss Bentley. Perjury however, requires two witnesses. Brunini obtained the second witness i»\\ browbeating Mrs. Remington into a statement that her former husband had told her that he paid dues to the Communist Party. To obtain this corroboration from the former Mrs. Remington, Brunini threatened hei with contempt proceedings, by making her believe, contrary to the truth, that the privilege against use of a wife's evidence did not apply to her after her separation from Remington in January 1947. This disgracelu procedure, which eventually led to Remington's conviction for perjury and to his death in prison by the hand of another prisoner, is indicative 0 Miss Bentley's attitude toward truth. To cover up her financial relation- ship with Brunini when she was preparing to cooperate with him m ll indictment of Remington, the book contract was redrawn, omitting Brunini's name. This was done apparently as a consequence of statenien of two employees of Devin-Adair who knew of the contract wit Brunini's name (one was the woman who typed it). A new contract wa drawn which did not contain Brunini's name, and the two employee left Devin-Adair's employment. The book, published under the title Ui of Bondage, in 1951, pretended to be Miss Bentley's memoirs, but tw years later, when an effort was made to use it against her in anothe judicial proceeding, she called it \"fiction.\" In addition to the distorting influence of profit, the story of the ^ on1 munist threat to the United States was also confused and manipulate for partisan motivations. When the wholesale revelations of ex-Corn munists began in 1947, the New Deal and its successor had been in l White House for more than fourteen years. The Republicans, especial J the congressional delegations, were prepared to do almost anything destroy the reputation of President Truman and the memory of Frank 1 Roosevelt in order to win the presidential election of 1948. They ^' cr offered a great opportunity to do so when the Republicans won contr of both Houses of Congress in the congressional elections of 194^- effort was spearheaded, in 1947 and 1948, by the House Committee 0 Un-American Activities, whose antics over previous years had alrea } shown large-scale disregard of the rules of good procedure, fair treatmen . and unbiased investigation. The HUAC in 1947-1948 had nine members of which the chief wer J. Parnell Thomas, of New Jersey (Chairman); Karl E. iMundt, of South Dakota; and Richard M. Nixon,' of California, on the Republican side, and four southern democrats, led by John S. Wood, of Georgia, an John E. Rankin, of Mississippi, on the Democratic side. The value"},{"pageNumber":940,"pageContent":"NUCLEAR RIVALRY AND THE COLD WAR: I 945-I 950 925 the publicity gained by the committee in these two years may be judged from tlie fact that it carried both Mundt and Nixon to the Senate in '948 and 1950 and the latter to the Vice-Presidency and close to the \"residency itself in 1952 and i960. There can be no doubt that the Republican members of the Committee realized the value of the pub- licity to be gained by membership on it and that their actions were con- sistently aimed more at partisan advantage for themselves and the dis- crediting of previous Democratic incumbents in the White House than they were directed to ascertaining the nature and functioning of the Com- rnunist conspiracy in the United States. Other legislative committees occa- sionally copied these tactics. It was this partisan, rather than investigatory, bias in the behavior of such committees which reduced so much of this investigation of Communism into personal vendettas such as those be- tween Hiss and Chambers, between Remington and Bentley, and be- tween Lattimore and Budenz. In these battles of personalities, charges a nd countercharges flew about so freely at hearings, in the press, over the airwaves, and occasionally in judicial proceedings, that the truth cannot now be ascertained. There can be no doubt that falsehood and ev en perjury were to be found on both sides. What is equally regrettable ls that numerous other accused Communists, both in government and 0u t, whose names were given to these committees on the same basis, and sometimes in the same breath, as Hiss, Remington, or Lattimore were a'niost totally ignored and lost in the personal controversies aroused 0v cr these three, largely because of the partisan handling of the investiga- tory committees. These revelations began in January and February 1947, when Budenz ent ified Gerhart Eisler as a Communist leader in the United States. Within a few weeks President Truman gave the investigators a prime Ve apon when he issued an order (March 21, 1947) requiring a loyalty °atn from all government workers. The significance of this was that any °mniunists in the government could be prosecuted for perjury unless tn ey had admitted the fact. tn the course of the summer the FBI arrested a half-dozen individuals t various times and announced that they \"had stolen vital atomic bomb Se crets from the heart of the atomic bomb project at Los Alamos.\" This arming news was reinforced by a number of press releases from the ^UAC. When the accused were brought to trial, however, it developed at they had been guilty of insignificant and technical infractions of ^ c law, such as taking snapshots of each other while serving as soldiers Tos Alamos or pilfering of government property there.

Apparently to bolster this request, on the last day 0 the month, from his hospital bed he issued a six-page report on L\". Edward U. Condon, Director of the National Bureau of Standards. Condon, one of the world's great authorities on quantum mechanics, » a been attacked by Thomas for about a year, chiefly in press releases an in two articles in national magazines, apparently because of animosity over Condon's opposition to the Johnson-Mays bill for atomic-energy control. The report of February 1948 said flatly, \"Dr. Condon is one 0 the weakest links in our atomic security.\" This charge was based on mishmash of falsehoods, irrelevancies, and incorrect inferences. It vva charged that Condon had obtained his job from the favor of Henry Wallace, then secretary of commerce, with the implication that Condo must be a Left-winger if Wallace was. In fact, Wallace did not even know Condon, and appointed him only for the administrative reaso that the Bureau of Standards was a part of the Commerce Department. Or again, the HUAC report quoted from a letter of J. Edgar Hoover to W. Averell Harriman when the latter was secretary of commerce m May 1947. This letter had been stolen from the FBI loyalty report on Condon and was merely a history of unevaluated reports of Condons actions as reported to the FBI. As published in the HUAC report it was edited to cut out (without any indication) sentences favorable to Con- don. It was charged that Condon's passport was taken up by the Stat Department when he planned to go to Russia in 1946. The fact was that this plan was a government-sponsored project to fly about two dozen American scientists to Russia in an army plane, and Condon participation was canceled by the army because it regarded him as too valuable a nuclear physicist to be risked behind the Iron Curtain, where he might be kidnapped. The HUAC report said that Condon recruite members to join an organization listed as \"subversive\" by the attorney general, the American-Soviet Science Society. It later developed that this organization, which existed for the purpose of translating scientific reports from Russian to English, using funds from the Rockefeller Foun- dation, had never been listed as subversive by the attorney general, bu on the contrary had been encouraged by the United States governmen as a method of finding out what the Russians were doing in science. The HUAC had simply confused this society with an entirely differ en organization, which the attorney general had listed. On this kind of evidence the HUAC demanded Condon's removal from the government and ominously reported that \"the situation as re- gards Dr. Condon is not an isolated one . . . there are other Government"},{"pageNumber":942,"pageContent":"NUCLEAR RIVALRY AND THE COLD WAR: 1945-1950 927 officials in strategic positions who are plaving Stalin's game to the detri- ment of the United States.\" Condon's repeated requests for an oppor- tunity to appear before the committee to refute its charges under oath were ignored. The committee, especially its chairman, continued to harass Condon so that it was impossible for him to do his work in the bureau of Standards. This was done by subjecting him to one loyalty investigation after another (each takes a great deal of work, by the FBI a nd the accused, and requires months). These investigations, one after another, cleared Dr. Condon, but each clearance was followed by new charges and a new investigation. After the fourth clearance, and the opening of a fifth investigation, Condon resigned from the government ln '954- This fifth investigation was demanded by Vice-President Nixon, who seems to have felt that his original participation in the unjustified smearing of Condon six years before had to be sustained by continued Persecution. By that time Chairman Thomas, who was the director of this persecution in 1947-1949, had been sent to prison as a common cri rninal for making the employees in his congressional office, paid from government funds, secretly give back substantial parts of their salaries to him. Thomas should have restricted his efforts for additional money to smearing innocent scientists in paid articles in national magazines. The Condon case was still in its early full publicity in July and August '948, when the Thomas committee hit the headlines for weeks, day after da .V. with the testimony of Louis Budenz, Elizabeth Bentlev, Whittaker Chambers, and other \"experts\" on Communists. They listed several dozen na mes of Communists in government in the 1930's, organized in formal groups or cells, and generally paying dues and sending information through \"couriers\" like Miss Bentley. Most of those named ignored the charges or simply made a denial to the press, but a few, such as Hiss, w .ho sought to refute the charges, were met by new ones. Eventually, * s We have seen, Remington and Hiss were both jailed for perjury, the Orrner for denying he had been a Communist and the latter for denying e gave government documents to Chambers. Both cases required two J als before convictions were obtained. Others of these named were called before the committee and refused 0 give evidence under the Fifth x\\mendment to the Constitution, which protects against self-incrimination. Little was done about these, but it ls clear that many of them were in fact Communists and that Bentley nd Chambers knew them as such, by hearsay at least. Bentley's original v 'idence in 1948 gave a score of names of Communists she had \"known\" ^ the government. More than two years passed before it became clear at she did not \"know\" them at all, had never met them, and could not entify them by sight, but had merely gathered their names from her °ntacts with the few Communists who reported directly to her and v hom she knew well. Similarly, she indicated in her original evidence"},{"pageNumber":943,"pageContent":"928  TRAGEDY AND HOPE that she broke with the Communists and went to the FBI, for patriotic reasons, in August 1945. Only in 1953, when the Eisenhower Adminis- tration was still trying to make a major issue of the Communists in the New Deal, did Attorney General Brownell, in publishing a letter of J. Edgar Hoover, inadvertently reveal that Miss Bentley's revelations to it did not begin until November 8, 1945, the day after the newspapers revealed that Budenz had been giving names. Miss Bentley's earlier visit to the FBI in New Haven in August 1945 had nothing to do with her desire to give information or with Communists, but was simply h er desire to find out if a man who had dated her was an employee of tn e FBI. The most sensational evidence from the HUAC was released in the late summer of 1948 just in time to influence the presidential election m November. Apparentlv it did not have the influence expected, since Truman was elected. The controversy from its revelations continued for years, and the charges, both from HUAC and from other sources, in- creased in violence. Few of the revelations after 1948 were ever sustained in court. For example, two separate \"atomic espionage\" cases involving Clarence F.

Eventually Hiskev refused to answer questions before HUAU was prosecuted for contempt, and was acquitted in 1951. Weinberg, accused by HUAC of giving \"atomic secrets\" to a well-known Commu- nist, Steven Nelson, eventually was prosecuted for perjury at the commit' tee's insistence, and was acquitted in 1953. Both scientists found their careers injured by the committee's charges. There were many sim lla cases. The revelation of Communist influence in the United States «*» undoubtedly valuable, but the cost, in damage to the reputations 0 innocent persons and in the total confusion of the American people, ^ va _ a very high and largely unnecessary cost. Eventually some agencies ° the government, such as the Bureau of Standards, the army and, abov all, the State Department were severely injured by loss of morale, \"i - ruption of work, and refusal of valuable personnel to work for tn government under such conditions. Much of this damage came from the efforts of Senator Joseph !*•• .McCarthy, Republican, of Wisconsin to prove that the State Depar ment and the army were widely infiltrated with Communists and fron the efforts of the neo-isolationists and the \"China lobby\" to demonstra that the Mao conquest of China was entirely due to the treasonable ac of Communists and fellow travelers in the State Department and t White House.

As such, he had Nothing to do with rationality or generality. Concepts, logic, distinctions °t categories were completely outside his world. It is, for example, perfectly clear that he did not have any idea of what a Communist was, st \"l less of Communism itself, and he did not care. This was simply a erm he used in his game of personal power. Most of the terms which have been applied to him, such as \"truculent,\" \"brutal,\" \"ignorant,\" sadistic,\" \"foul-mouthed,\" \"brash,\" are quite correct but not quite in he sense that his enemies applied them, because they assumed that these Qualities and distinctions had meaning in his world as they did in their OWn. They did not, because his behavior was all an act, the things he Ql d to gain the experience he wanted, that is, the feeling of power, of creating fear, of destroying the rules, and of winning attention and a dmiration for doing so. His act was that of Peck's Bad Boy, but on a colossal scale, as the total rejection of everything he had come from in h' s first twenty years of life. He sought fame and acclaim by showing an admiring world of schoolmates what a tough guy he was, defying all the rules, even the rules of decencv and ordinary civilized behavior. \"Ut like the bad boy of the schoolyard, he had no conception of time °r anything established, and once he had found his act, it was necessary 0 demonstrate it every day.

It had nothing to do with the power of authority or regulated discipline, but the personal power of a sadist. All his destructive in- stincts were against anything established, the wealthy, the educated, the Ve 'l mannered, the rules of the Senate, the American party system, the rules of fair plav. As such, he had no conception of truth or the dis- m ction between it and falsehood, just as he had no conception of yesterday, todav, tomorrow as distinct entities.

Everyone, he was con- vinced, had a racket; this just happened to be his, and he expecte people to realize this and to understand it. Of course, to the observant outsider who did not share his tota amorality, it was all false, invented as he went along, and constantly changed, everything substantiated by documents pulled from his bulging briefcase and waved about too rapidly to be read. Mostly these docu- ments had nothing to do with what he was saying; mostly he had neve looked at them himself; they were merelv props for the performance, and, to him, it was as silly for his audience to expect such documents to be relevant as it would be for the audience in a theater to expect 11 food that is being eaten, the whiskey that is being drunk, or the docu- ments which are read in that play to be relevant to what the actor 1 saying. Like any actor who might be charged with inconsistency or wi lying because what he says in one play is not compatible with what n says in another play, McCarthy was puzzled, offended, hurt, or amuse With him every day, every hour, was a different play. As a result, the audience nothing was consistent with anything else. He gave sever different dates for his birth, and after 1945, never the correct one (November 14, 1908). Every time he spoke or wrote of his war experi- ences, the story was a different one, and with each version he becam a larger, more nonchalant hero. Eventually, in 1952, when his powe in Washington was at its height, and most of the government feared v draw his wrath (or even his attention), he intimidated the Air Fore into awarding him the Distinguished Flving Cross (given for twenty- five combat missions), although he had been a grounded intelligence officer, who took occasional rides in planes. Since laws and regulations were, for McCarthy, nonexistent, his busi- ness and financial affairs are, like his life, a chaos of illegalities. Fro 1935 to 1942 his gross income was less than $25,000, yet during the seve years he put more than twice that into the stock market. When he wa elected judge in 1939, one of his earliest decisions \\vas appealed by t state to its supreme court, where it was found that McCarthy had de- stroyed those portions of the record in'which he had justified dismissing the state's complaints. Shortly after he arrived in Washington, as a new senator in 1947, he heard of Pepsi-Cola's difficulties with sugar rationing' accepted a $10,000 unsecured loan from Pepsi-Cola's lobbyist, and, trie next day, opened an attack on sugar rationing. When this attack v/a successful, the same lobbyist endorsed a note for $20,000 which M c ' Carthy used to cover his overextended bank account in Wisconsin.

One of these favors was $10,000 from Lustron Corporation in return for putting his name, as author, on one of its Publicity releases. And so it went, most of his ill-gotten gains being dissipated on horse-racing bets, gambling, or parties for his friends. When the Senate Subcommittee on Privileges and Elections, late in 1951, e gan to study one of his bank accounts, it found unexplained deposits of al most $173,000 and others of almost $97,000 funneled through the administrative assistant in his office. Until early 1950, Communism meant little to McCarthy. He had been e 'ected to the Senate over the incumbent, La Follette, in 1946, as a result °t Communist-controlled votes in the labor unions of Milwaukee. As e iator lie collaborated in a joint Nazi and Communist plot to injure the Un ited States and its army by reversing the convictions of German S.S. troops for atrocities committed on American prisoners of war captured \"1 the Battle of the Bulge. But by January 1950, McCarthy was looking or an issue to be used for his reelection in 1952. At dinner with three rrie n, two of them associates of mine, in the Colony Restaurant in Wash- m gton (January 7, 1950) he asked what issue he should use. After several su ggestions, he seized upon Communism: \"That's it,\" he said. \"The government is full of Communists. We can hammer away at them.\" , ° obtain an audience for this hammering, he requested bookings for m coln's Birthday speeches from the Senate Repub/lican Campaign ornmittee and was given assignments at Wheeling, West Virginia, Salt ake City, and Reno. Without any real conception of what he was . 01n g, and without any research or knowledge of the subject, at Wheel- m g on February 9 th, McCarthy waved a piece of paper (copy of a four- year-old letter from Byrnes to Representative Adolph Sabath) and said, While I cannot take the time to name all of the men in the State e Partnient who have been named as members of the Communist Party nd members of a spy ring, I have here in my hand a list of 205 that er e known to the Secretary of State as being members of the Commu- lst Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping the policy the State Department.\" The letter in fact named no names, had otliing to do with spying or even with Communists, but simply re- ported that 3,000 employees of abolished war agencies, who were being tfted to the State Department budget, had been screened and 284 had ee n listed as undesirable (of which 79 had been already separated from ^ce, 26 of these because they were aliens). Every time McCarthy P e ated the charge, the numbers and the categories changed; for ex- m P'e, the following night, he told his Salt Lake City audience, \"Last Sht • • .

He loved it. On February 20th, in an incoherent speech of more than six hours in the Senate, he announced that he had penetrated \"Truman's iron curtain of secrecy\" and that he was going to give 81 cases, identified by numbers without names. What ensued in the next six hours was bedlam, as case after case was presented, filled with contra- dictions and irrelevancies. There were 81 numbers but only 66 cases, for cases were left out, some were repeated with different numbers, many had never been employed by the State Department or even by the government, and one, \"primarily a morals case,\" had been discharge''] from it because he was \"anti-Communist,\" while another, Case 72, was \"a high type of man, a Democratic American who . . . opposed Com- munism.\" It was, according to the Senate Republican leader, Senator Taft, \"a perfectly reckless performance.\" Nevertheless, Taft and hi« colleagues determined to accept and support these charges, since they would injure the Administration. Accordingly, Taft told .McCarthy. \"If one case doesn't work, try another.\" The public, informed only of the charges, without the cynical details, gathered from the newspaper headlines that the State Department was full of Communist spies. Even today few people realize that McCarthy, in five years of accusarions, never turned up a Communist in the State Department, although un- doubtedly there must have been some there. .McCarthy repeated this performance before a Senate subcommittee chaired by Senator .Millard Tydings of Maryland, a few weeks later. From March 7th through early July, this subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee took i,' 5 oo printed pages of testimony pl uS more than 1,000 pages of documentation. McCarthy's testimony, »* soon developed, was based entirely on evidence turned\" up by House of Representative committees of the previous Congress. He gave names to the 66 cases (he called it 81 cases) he had mentioned in his Senate speech and 35 new names. In few cases was there any evidence. When asked for evidence, he airily told Senator Tydings that that was his job: the evidence was in the State Department,' and it was up to the com- mittee to get it. After the files in question were obtained by the committee and found to contain no evidence to support McCarthy' s charges, McCarthy called them \"phonv files\" and insisted they had been \"raped and rifled\" of the FBI reports which had been in them. J. Edgar Hoover was called in, had the files examined, and reported that \"the State Department files were intact.\" McCarthy ignored this rebuff. New charges followed. Eventual!}' he announced that he would base his whole reputation on one case. For more than a week he tantalized the world and the committee by with- holding the name: \"the top Russian espionage agent\" in the United States, \"Alger Hiss's boss in the espionage ring in the State Department,\""},{"pageNumber":948,"pageContent":"NUCLEAR RIVALRY AND THE COLD WAR: I945-I95O 933 me chief architect of our Far Eastern policy.\" At last the name was Pleased: Professor Owen Lattimore, of the Johns Hopkins University, he English-speaking world's greatest authority on Mongolia. The only rouble was that Lattimore was not a Communist, not a spy, and not employed by the State Department. I he Tydings subcommittee report, issued in July, condemned Mc- arthy for \"a fraud and a hoax\" on the Senate: \"Starting with nothing, oiator jMcCarthy plunged headlong forward, desperately seeking to ev elop some information.\" McCarthy should have been finished. He Vas not. And for a very simple reason: in politics truth is not so im- portant as power, and McCarthy soon showed that he had the power— power of an inflamed and misled public opinion. In the election of 0v ember 1950, several members of the Senate who had been most uts P°ken against McCarthy, including some of the most influential eaders of that august body, were defeated—by McCarthyism, if not by i rtn .V- Tydings was beaten in Maryland in 1950, and Scott Lucas, e Democratic leader in the Senate, who had harassed McCarthy during ls performance on February 20th, went down with him. William Ben- on ) senator from Connecticut, who introduced a resolution to expel icLarthy from the Senate in 1951 and whose charges were fully sup- Ported by the Senate's investigation of McCarthy's private finances, was eated in 1952. With him went down to defeat Lucas's successor as emocratic leader, Senator McFarland of Arizona. From 1950 to 1954 ost of his fellow senators, and many in the executive branch, were rr orized by McCarthy's power with the electorate, and opposed him n nothing they could possibly concede. During this period he violated or e laws and regulations than any previous senator in history. Thou- n ds of his secret supporters in the Administration sent him information J^ misinformation, classified secrets, spite letters, anonymous notes, he Eisenhower Administration at one time considered charging Mc- arthy himself with espionage but did not have the courage. Much of lls material was read by McCarthy over nationwide television broad- sts. when a reporter once said to him, \"Isn't that a classified docu- ment? \" McCarthy said, \"It was. I just declassified it.\" \" may be doubted that McCarthy's power to defeat his enemies was great as they thought, but he encouraged these thoughts. Certainly he defeated Tydings.

The Republicans were as scared as the Democrats, and with g 00 reason, for party lines, like all other distinctions, meant nothing to Mc- Carthy, and he continued his charges in 1953-1954 with his own party control of both houses of Congress and Eisenhower in the White Hous • The chief change was that he stopped talking of \"twenty years 0 treason\" in the White House and talked of \"twenty-one years of trea- son.\" The new President, in an effort to divert these attacks, continue • The to yield to him, as he had yielded to him during the campaign. * Administration was soon boasting that 1,456 Federal workers had be \"separated\" in the first four months of the \"Eisenhower security p r0 1 ro gram.\" At the end of the first year the President raised this total 2,200. It took some weeks for the Democrats to discover that the figures did not apply to subversives or even to security risks, but anyone who left the government service. By the end of its first year, new Administration adopted completely McCarthy's refusal to be ha pered by categories. Vice-President Nixon said, \"We're kicking £ Communists and fellow travelers and security risks out of the Gover ment ... by the thousands.\" It was soon clear that no known Con munists were kicked out and that \"security risks\" included all kinds persons, such as those who imbibed too freely at Washington's endie cocktail parties.

This whole subject is too complex for adequate discussion here, out the situation must be outlined.

This helped finance the family's interest in modern ar and dramatic theater, including sister Beatrix's tours as a Shakespearea actress. Alike Straight served in the Air Force in 1943-1945, hut this did no in any way hamper his career with The New Republic. He became Washington correspondent in .May 1941; editor in June 1943; and p u lisher in December 1946 (when lie made Henry Wallace editor). Durin D these shifts he changed completely the control of The New RepuvliCi and its companion magazine Asia, removing known liberals (such a Robert Morss Lovett, Malcolm Cowley, and George Soule), centralizing the control, and taking it into his own hands. This control by Whitn e , money had, of course, always existed, but it had been in abeyance i° the twentv-five years following Willard Straight's death. The first editor of The New Republic, the well-known \"liberal Herbert Croly, was always aware of the situation. After ten years in w job, he explained the relationship in the \"official\" biography of Wil' ar Straight which he wrote for a payment of $25,000. \"Of course they L tl1 Straights] could always withdraw their financial support if they cease to approve of the policy of the paper; and, in that event, it would g out of existence as a consequence of their disapproval.\" Croly's bwg raphy of Straight, published in 1924, makes perfectly clear that Straig was in no sense a liberal or a progressive, but was, indeed, a typ ical international banker and that The New Republic was simply a medw for advancing certain designs of such international bankers, notably blunt the isolationism and anti-British sentiments so prevalent amo g many America progressives, while providing them with a vehicle 1 expression of their progressive views in literature, art, music, soci reform, and even domestic politics. In 1916, when the editorial boa wanted to support Wilson for a second term in the Presidency, Wi'» Straight took two pages of the magazine to express his own supp° rt . Hughes. The chief achievement of The New Republic, however, 1 1914-1918 and again in 1938-1948, was for interventionism in Eu r0 P and support of Great Britain.

Whitney Foundation, the Gertrude ^anderbilt Whitney Foundation, the J. H. Whitney Foundation, and others. An interesting addition was made to these enterprises in 1947 When Straight founded a new magazine, the United Nations World, to e devoted to the support of the UN. Its owners of record were The e w Republic itself (under its corporate name), Nelson Rockefeller, J- H. Whitney, Max Ascoli (an anti-Fascist Italian who had married American wealth and used it to support a magazine of his own, The Reporter), and Beatrice S. Dolivet. The last lady, Mike Straight's sister, niade h er husband, Louis Dolivet, \"International Editor\" of the new ma gazine. ( An important element in this nexus was Asia magazine, which had • een established by Morgan's associates as the journal of the American ' siatic Society in 1898, had been closely associated with Willard Straight Unng hi s lifetime, and was owned outright by him from Januarv 1917. n the 1930's it was operated for the Whitneys bv Richard J. Walsh an \" his wife, known to the world as Pearl Buck. Walsh, who acted as 'tor of Asia, was also president of the holding corporation of The . e%D Republic for several years and president of the John Day publish- • § company.

In 1947, when e Straight began a drive to \"sell\" the United Nations, it was com- Petely reorganized into United Nations World. Mike Straight was deeply anti-Communist, but he frequently was Un d associated with them, sometimes as a collaborator, frequently as °Pponent. The opposition was seen most clearly in his efforts as one the founders of the American Veterans Committee (AVC) and its Political sequel, the Americans for Democratic Action (ADA). The laboration may be seen in Straight's fundamental role in Henry Wal- es third-party campaign for the Presidencv in 1948. . relationship between Straight and the Communists in pushing \"lace into his 1948 adventure mav be misjudged very easilv. The '-Communist Right had a very simple explanation of it: Wallace and • Ul ght were Communists and hoped to elect Wallace President. Noth- S could be further from the truth. All three—Straight, Wallace, and Communists, joined in the attempt merely as a means of defeating u man.

It s a brilliantly done piece of work."},{"pageNumber":957,"pageContent":"a 942  TRAGEDY AND HOPE The Communists wanted a third party in 1948 because it seemed tne only way to beat Truman and destroy the Marshall Plan. They hate the President for the \"Truman Doctrine\" and his general opposition t the Soviet Union, but, above all, because he had prevented the postwa economic collapse and the American relapse into isolationism, both ° which the Communists had not only expected but critically needed, was obvious to everyone that a two-party campaign in 1948 would g lV the vote of the Right to the Republicans and the vote of the Left to the Democrats, with the victory decided by where the division came 1 the Center. In such a situation neither Straight nor the Communists cou influence the outcome in any way. But a third party on the Left- • taking labor and other Left-wing votes from Truman, could reduce t Democratic totals in the major states enough to throw those states an the election to the Republicans. Why Straight wanted to do this in rl critical months from September 1946 to April 1948 is unknown, but n clearly changed his mind in the spring of 1948, abandoning poor, daiv Henry Wallace to the Communists at that time. A possible explanation 0 these actions will be given later. What is clear is that Mike Straight had a great deal to do with vy a lace in the autumn of 1946 when the former Vice-President broke W Truman and was fired from the Cabinet. The break came over a Wa» a speech, very critical of American policy toward Russia, given bcfoie wildly biased pro-Soviet audience in Madison Square Garden on Septet\" ber 12, 1946. At the time Truman told reporters he had approved t speech before delivery (a version which Wallace still upholds), bu ' within a few days, Secretary of State Byrnes forced the President to ma a choice between him or Wallace, and the latter was dismissed from t Cabinet. Out of the government, without a platform from which to addre the public, Wallace's political future looked dim in the early autumn 1946. Straight provided the platform, by giving him his own editon chair at The New Republic (announced October 12, 1946). For the ne- fifteen months the Wallace campaign was a Straight campaign. The • ter supplied speechwriters, research assistants, editorial writers, orn space, money, and The New Republic itself. Technically Wallace ^\" editor, but the magazine staff and expenditures steadily increased in dire tions which had little to do with the magazine and everything to do w Wallace's presidential campaign, although this effort was not annoim*- to the public until a year later, in December 1947.

It would not be strictly true to sav that Straight \"brought 11 in,\" but I believe it is fair to say that he \"let them in.\" For example < of the first to arrive was Lew Frank, Jr., brought! in bv Straight) later insisted that he did not realize that Frank was a Communist- ^"},{"pageNumber":958,"pageContent":"NUCLEAR RIVALRY AND THE COLD WAR: 1945-I95O 943 ma «er of fact, there was no evidence that Frank was a member of the Communist Party, but Straight knew exactly where Frank stood po- 'tically since they had engaged, on opposite sides, in a bitter struggle etvveen Communists and anti-Communists for control of AVC. In this, 'Tank had been a member of the Communist caucus within AVC's na- •onal planning committee (as Straight told David A. Shannon in 1956), ar *d followed every twist of the party line in this whole period. This Party line became the pattern for Wallace's formal speeches, since Frank * as his most important speechwriter over a period of eighteen months fro in early 1947 to October 1948. More than this, Frank accompanied Wallace on his endless travels during this period. In the autumn of 1947 these three, Wallace, Frank, and Straight, made a trip to the Mediter- ranean and were given an audience together by the Pope on November 4, '^47- On his return from this journey, Wallace was a changed man; his llr >d was made up, to run against Truman on a third-partv ticket. The announcement was made public in The New Republic in December. Straight continued to work for Wallace for President, and The New e public remained the center of the movement for almost four more °nths, but something had changed. While he was still working for Wal- ac e as President and allowing the Communists into the project, he was lrr iultaneously doing two other things: working openly, and desperately, prevent the new third party from campaigning on any level other ar > the presidential, by blocking everywhere he could Communist ef- r ts to run third-partv candidates for state or congressional offices in ^petition with the Democrats; much less publicly, he worked with s anti-Communist friends in labor, veteran, and liberal groups to pre- nt endorsement of the Wallace candidacy. As a consequence, the Com- nists were destroved and eventually driven out of such organizations, n otably from t h e CIO-PAC (the great political alignment of labor and \" °gressive groups). As David Shannon wrote in The Decline of Amer- an Communism (1959), \"The Communists' support of Wallace shat- ed the 'left-center' coalition in the CIO; for the Communist unions, the Wallace movement was the beginning of the end. The coalition began \"issolve almost immediately after Wallace's announcement.\" What this atls is that Wallace's campaign to defeat Truman destroyed com- ity the remaining vestiges of the Popular Front movement of the i./° s > drove the Communists out of the unions and all progressive po- c al groups, and drove the Communist unions out of the labor move- nt of the country.

Edgar Hoover or HUAC did their work. e nie n who achieved this feat were Wallace and Straight, although it 111 not completely clear if they recognized what they were doing, uring the winter of 1947-1948, Lew Frank recognized that he was"},{"pageNumber":959,"pageContent":"944  TRAGEDY AND HOPE incapable of handling the complex issues raised in Wallace's many speeches. Accordingly, he joined a \"Communist research group\" which met in the Manhattan home of the wealthy \"Wall Street Red,\" Frederick Vanderbilt Field. The chief members of this group, probably all Com- munists, were Victor Perlo and David Ramsay. This pair drew up i° r Wallace an attack on the Marshall Plan and an alternative Communist plan for European reconstruction, which was published in The N^ Republic on January 12, 1948, was presented by Wallace to the Marshall Plan \"Hearings\" of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on February 24th, but was subsequently repudiated by Straight. In the three months following the Perlo article, Straight was busy sawing off the limb on which Wallace now sat with the Communists. He discharged from TM New Republic payroll all those who were working for the campaig n rather than for the magazine, and the office on East Forty-ninth Street once again settled down to publishing a \"liberal\" weekly. In protest a this reversal, his managing editor, Edd Johnson, resigned. If Mike Straight planned to do what he did do to the Communists in 1946-1948, that is, to get them out of progressive movements an unions, he pulled off the most skillful political coup in twentieth centur) American politics. It is not clear that he did plan it or intend it. But ; a very able and informed man, he must have had some motivation WjW he began, in 1947, the effort which he knew might defeat Truman 1 1948. While the evidence is not conclusive, there are hints that anotnc , more personal, motive might have been involved, at least partly, in bui ing up the Wallace threat to Truman's political future. It concerns m Whitney family interest in overseas airlines. The Whitney family were deeply involved in airlines. Sonny Whitfl j was a founder of Pan-American Airlines and chairman of its board directors from its establishment in 1928 until he went to military servi in 1941. Mike's brother, Air Commodore Whitney Willard Straig C.B.E., was even more deeply involved on the British side. Big brot Whitney (born in 1912) had been in civil aviation in England from V age of twenty-two, and bv 1946-1949, was not only a director or Midland Bank, one of the world's greatest financial institutions, but also a director of Rolls-Rovce and of BOAC, as well as chairman 01 board of directors of BEA (British European Airways). In the years lowing the end of the war, a violent struggle was going on, within ation circles and the United States government, over the future of Am ican transocean air services. Before the war, these had been a monop of Pan-Am; now, at the end of the war, the struggle was over how CAB would divide up this monopoly and what disposition woul made of the enormous air-force investment in overseas bases. Apparei j the White House was not cooperative in these matters at first, hut in 1947 C.

This was the most important post con- cerned with civil aviation in any Federal department. The connection, \" any, between these appointments and Mike Straight's original support and later abandonment of Wallace has never been revealed. The associations between Wall Street and the Left, of which Mike straight is a fair example, are really survivals of the associations between tne Morgan Bank and the Left. To Morgan all political parties were S1 niply organizations to be used, and the firm always was careful to keep a loot in all camps. Morgan himself, Dwight Morrow, and other partners Were allied with Republicans; Russell C. Leffingwell was allied with the e mocrats; Grayson Murphy was allied with the extreme Right; and 1 nomas W. Lamont was allied with the Left. Like the Morgan interest ln \"oraries, museums, and art, its inability to distinguish between loyalty 0 the United States and loyalty to England, its recognition of the need °r social work among the poor, the multipartisan political views of the 1 Morgan firm in domestic politics went back to the original founder of ne firm, George Peabodv (1795-1869). To this same seminal figure may e attributed the use of tax-exempt foundations for controlling these ct ivities, as may be observed in many parts of America to this day, in \"^ use of Peabody foundations to support Peabody libraries and mu- e Urns. Unfortunately, we do not have space here for this great and nt old story, but it must be remembered that what we do say is part of a much larger picture, ^ur concern at the moment is with the links between Wall Street and e Left, especially the Communists. Here the chief link was the Thomas r^- Lamont family. This family was in many ways parallel to the traight family. Tom Lamont had been brought into the Morgan firm, s Straight was several years later, bv Henry P. Davison, a Morgan part- er from 1909. Lamont became a partner in 1910, as Straight did in 1913. ac n had a wife who became a patroness of Leftish causes, and two sons, r which the elder was a conventional banker, and the younger was a e u-wjng sympathizer and sponsor. In fact, all the evidence would in- nate that Tom Lamont was simply Morgan's apostle to the Left in Recession to Straight, a change made necessary by the latter's premature eath in 1918. Both were financial supporters of liberal publications, in aniont's case The Saturday Review of Literature, which he supported throughout the 1920's and 1930's, and the New York Post, which he owned from 1918 to 19:4. * he chief evidence, however, can be found in the files of the HUAC VJuch show Tom Lamont, his wife Flora, and his son Corliss as sponsors a,1 d financial angels to almost a score of extreme Left organizations, in- cl uding the Communist Party itself. Among these we need mention only"},{"pageNumber":961,"pageContent":"94^  TRAGEDY AKD HOPE rwo. One of these was a Communist-front organization, the Trade Union Services, Incorporated, of New York City, which in 1947 published fif- teen trade-union papers for various CIO unions. Among its officers were Corliss Lamont and Frederick Vanderbilt Field (another link between Wall Street and the Communists). The latter was on the editorial boards of the official Communist newspaper in New York, the Daily Worker, as well as its magazine. The Neiv Masses, and was the chief link between the Communists and the Institute of Pacific Relations in 1928-1947- Cor- liss Lamont was the leading light in another Communist organization, which started life in the 1920's as the Friends of the Soviet Union, but in 1943 was reorganized, with Lamont as chairman of the board and chief incorporator, as the National Council of American-Soviet Friend- ship. During this whole period of over two decades, Corliss Lamont, Wit\" the full support of his parents, was one of the chief figures in \"fellow traveler\" circles and one of the chief spokesmen for the Soviet point of view both in these organizations and also in connections which came to him either as son of the most influential man in Wall Street or as professor of philosophy- at Columbia University. His relationship with his parents mav be reflected in a few events of this period. In January 1946, Corliss Lamont was called before HUAC to g iv ' e testimony- on the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship- He refused to produce records, was subpoenaed, refused, was charged wit\" contempt of Congress, and was so cited by the House of Representatives on June 26, 1946. In the midst of this controversy, in May, Corliss La- mont and his mother, .Mrs. Thomas Lamont, presented their valuable collection of the works of Spinoza to Columbia University. The adverse publicity continued, yet when Thomas Lamont rewrote his will, on January 6, 1948, Corliss Lamont remained in it as co-heir to his fathers fortune of scores of millions of dollars. In 1951 the Subcommittee on Internal Security of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the so-called AlcCarran Committee, sought to show that China had been lost to the Communists by the deliberate actions of a group of academic experts on the Far East and Communist fellow trav- elers whose work in that direction was controlled and coordinated by the Institute of Pacific Relations (IPR). The influence of the Communists in IPR is well established, but the patronage of Wall Street is less wel known. The IPR was a private association of ten independent national coun- cils in ten countries concerned with affairs in the Pacific. The headquar- ters of the IPR and of the American Council of IPR were both in Ne\"' York and were closely associated on an interlocking basis. Each spen about $2.5 million dollars over the quarter-century from 1925 to 195 0 ' °, which about half, in each case, came from the Carnegie Foundation an"},{"pageNumber":962,"pageContent":"NUCLEAR RIVALRY AND THE COLD WAR: I945-I95O 947 'he Rockefeller Foundation (which were themselves interlocking groups controlled by an alliance of .Morgan and Rockefeller interests in Wall Street). Much of the rest, especially of the American Council, came from hrnis closely allied to these two Wall Street interests, such as Standard *-*\". International Telephone and Telegraph, International General Elec- tri c, the National City Bank, and the Chase National Bank. In each case, about 10 percent of income came from sales of publications and, of course, a certain amount came from ordinary members who paid $15 a }' e ar and received the periodicals of the IPR and its American Council, ocific Affairs and Far Eastern Survey. I he financial deficits which occurred each year were picked up by . an cial angels, almost all with close Wall Street connections. The chief ld entifi a bi e contributions here were about $60,000 from Frederick Vander- \"t Field over eighteen years, $14,700 from Thomas Lamont over four- een years, $800 from Corliss Lamont (only after 1947), and 118,000 f om a member of Lee, Higginson in Boston who seems to have been Jerome D. Greene. In addition, large sums of money each year were lr ected to private individuals for research and travel expenses from nil 'ar sources, chiefly the great financial foundations. 'Host of these awards for work in the Far Eastern area required ap- F °val or recommendation from members of IPR. Moreover, access to Publication and recommendations to academic positions in the handful . great American universities concerned with the Far East required . \"war sponsorship. And, finally, there can be little doubt that consultant Is on Far Eastern matters in the State Department or other govern- ent agencies were largely restricted to IPR-approved people. The in- Vl duals who published, who had money, found jobs, were consulted, who were appointed intermittently to government missions were 0se who were tolerant of the IPR line. The fact that all these lines of c °mniunication passed through the Ivy League universities or their scat- re d equivalents west of the Appalachians, such as Chicago, Stanford, Lalifomja^ unquestionably went back to Morgan's influence in han- ln g large academic endowments. t re can be little doubt that the more active academic members of . K < the professors and publicists who became members of its govern- 5 board (such as Owen Lattimore, Joseph P. Chamberlain, and Philip Jessup of Columbia, William \\Y. Lockwood of Princeton, John K. ai rbank of Harvard, and others) and the administrative staff (which be- ' IT >e, in time, the most significant influence in its policies) developed *^R party line. It is, furthermore, fairly clear that this IPR line had any poi nts in common both with the Kremlin's party line on the Far . asc aiul with the State Department's policy line in the same area. The errelations among these, or the influence of one on another, is highly s pured. Certainly no final conclusions can be drawn. Clearly there were"},{"pageNumber":963,"pageContent":"94^  TRAGEDY AND HOPE some Communists, even party members, involved (such as Frederick Vanderbilt Field), but it is much less clear that there was any disloyalty to the United States. Furthermore, there was a great deal of intrigue both to help those who agreed with the IPR line and to influence United States government policv in this direction, but there is no evidence or which 1 am aware of any explicit plot or conspiracy to direct American policy in a direction favorable either to the Soviet Union or to interna- tional Communism. Efforts of the radical Right to support their con- victions about these last points undoubtedly did great, lasting, and unfair damage to the reputations and interests of many people. The true explanation of what happened is not vet completely knov' n and, as far as it is known, is too complicated to elucidate here. It )S ' however, clear that manv persons who were born in the period l 9 oCy ~ 1920 and came to maturity in the period 1928-1940 were so influence by rheir experiences of war, depression, and insecurity that they adopted more or less unconsciously, certain aspects of the Communist ideology (such as the economic interpretation of history, the role of a dualist class struggle in human events, or the exploitative interpretation of tn role of capital in the productive system and of the possessing groups J any society). Many of these ideas were nonsense, even in terms of the own experiences, but they were facile interpretative guides for pcop who, whatever their expert knowledge of their special areas, were lacK ing in total perspective on society as a whole or human experience a s whole. Moreover, many of these people felt an unconscious obligation \"help the underdog.\" This favorable attitude toward the downtrodue and the oppressed was rooted in our Western Christian heritage, e pccially in nineteenth-century humanitarianism, and in the older Christu idea that all persons are redeemable and will prove trustworthy 11 l ; are but trusted. This outlook was, for example, prevalent in that ubiq tous intriguer, Lionel Curtis, who was the original guide and paren the IPR and of many similar organizations. As children of missionan many of the organizers and members of the IPR obtained this spirit it their family background along with their knowledge of the Far East languages which made them \"experts.\" It must be confessed that the IPR had many of the marks of a fe\"° traveler or Communist \"captive\" organization. But this does not, W way, mean that the radical Right or the professional ex-Communist sion of these events is accurate. For example, Elizabeth Bentley and, 8D all, Louis Budenz testified before the McCarran Committee on tire The latter identified almost every person associated with the organ' • tion as a Communist or \"under Communist discipline\" by his P elS0 ' knowledge. In the most famous case, that of Owen Lattimorc, I>iuic emphatic testimony that Lattimore was a Communist and that his or were issued by small Communist Party conclaves of Earl Brow"},{"pageNumber":964,"pageContent":"NUCLEAR RIVALRY AND THE COLD WAR: 1945-1950 949 cudenz, F. V. Field, and others was totally refuted, not only by the direct contradictor}' testimony of Browder and Field, but by subsequent evidence from more reliable witnesses and from Budenz himself. Ques- tioning eventually made it clear that Budenz did not know Lattimore or \"'s work or any of his books (including one which he quoted as proof °| Lattimore's adherence to the party line). Moreover, Budenz gave direct testimony that the 1944 mission to China of Vice-President Henry vallace, accompanied by Lattimore and John Carter Vincent (a State epartment expert on the Far East who has been accused of Commu- nism), drew up recommendations which were pro-Communist. This was shown to be the exact contrary of the truth and a mere figment of udenz's active imagination. Budenz testified that the replacement of general Stilwell (who was anti-Chiang and relatively favorable to Mao) V General Wedemeyer was the consequence of the influence of Latti- more and Vincent on Wallace. Joseph Alsop, who was present at all the 'Hussions in question and drafted the recommendations, later testified wt he himself was the author of all the \"pro-Communist\" passages which u denz attributed to Lattimore and that he himself had suggested the relatively pro-Chiang General Wedemever as Stilwell's successor in order 0 block Wallace's suggestion of General Chennault for the position. 1 he radical Right version of these events as written up by John T. .Vnn, Freda Utley, and others, was even more remote from the truth ; an were Budenz's or Bentley's versions, although it had a tremendous mpact on American opinion and American relations with other coun- ts in the years 1947-1955. This radical Right fairy tale, which is now n acc epted folk myth in many groups in America, pictured the recent 'story of the United States, in regard to domestic reform and in foreign . ai rs, as a well-organized plot by extreme Left-wing elements, operat- n g from the White House itself and controlling all the chief avenues of Publicity in the United States, to destroy the American way of life, ased on private enterprise, laissez faire, and isolationism, in behalf of • e n ideologies of Russian Socialism and British cosmopolitanism (or in- ernationalism). This plot, if we are to believe the myth, worked through Uch avenues of publicity as The Neiv York Times and the Herald ribune, the Christian Science Monitor and the Washington Post, the Uantic Monthly and Harper's Magazine and had at its core the wild-eyed n d bushy-haired theoreticians of Socialist Harvard and the London c hool of Economics. It was determined to bring the United States into R V orld War II on the side of England (Roosevelt's first love) and Soviet ussia (his second love) in order to destroy every finer element of Ameri- Can life and, as part of this consciously planned scheme, invited Japan to at *ack Pearl Harbor, and destroyed Chiang Kai-shek, all the while under- ln 'ng America's real strength by excessive spending and unbalanced budgets."},{"pageNumber":965,"pageContent":"95°  TRAGEDY AND HOPE This myth, like all fables, does in fact have a modicum of truth. There does exist, and has existed for a generation, an international Anglophile network which operates, to some extent, in the way the radical Right believes the Communists act. In fact, this network, which we may identity as the Round Table Groups, has no aversion to cooperating with the Communists, or any other groups, and frequently does so. I know of the operations of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960's, to examine its papers and secret records. I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims ana have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instru- ments.

The Round Table Groups have already been mentioned in this boo several rimes, notably in connection with the formation of the Britis Commonwealth in chapter 4 and in the discussion of appeasement in chapter 12 (\"the Cliveden Set\"). At the risk of some repetition, the story will be summarized here, because the American branch of this organiza- tion (sometimes called the \"Eastern Establishment\") has played a very significant role in the historv of the United States in the last generation. The Round Table Groups were semi-secret discussion and lobbying groups organized bv Lionel Curtis, Philip H. Kerr (Lord Lothian), alU ^ (Sir) William S. Marris in 1908-1911. This was done on behalf of L° r Milner, the dominant Trustee of the Rhodes Trust in the two decades 1905-1925. The original purpose of these groups was to seek to fedcra the English-speaking world along lines laid down by Cecil Rhodes (1 °5 3\" 1902) and William T. Stead (1849-1912), and the money for the orga\"- izational work came originally from the Rhodes Trust. By 1915 R° u Table groups existed in seven countries, including England, South Arri ' Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, and a rather loosely organize group in the United States (George Louis Beer, Walter Lippmann, F ra \" Aydelotte, Whitney Shepardson, Thomas W.

The original intention had been to have collegia! leader- s,1I p, but Milner was too secretive and headstrong to share the role. He \"id so only in the period 1913-1919 when he held regular meetings with some of his closest friends to coordinate their activities as a pressure group in the struggle with Wilhelmine Germany. This they called their Ginger Group.\" After Milner's death in 1925, the leadership was largely snared by the survivors of Milner's \"Kindergarten,\" that is, the group of young Oxford men whom he used as civil servants in his reconstruction °f South Africa in 1901-1910. Brand was the last survivor of the \"Kinder- garten\"; since his death, the greatly reduced activities of the organization nave been exercised largely through the Editorial Committee of The Round Table magazine under Adam Marris. Money for the widely ramified activities of this organization came or 'ginally from the associates and followers of Cecil Rhodes, chiefly Ir °m the Rhodes Trust itself, and from wealthy associates such as the Beit brothers, from Sir Abe Bailev, and (after 1915) from the Astor »amily. Since 1925 there have been substantial contributions from wealthy ln dividuals and from foundations and firms associated with the interna- lonal banking fraternity, especially the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, an d other organizations associated with J. P. Morgan, the Rockefeller and Whitney families, and the associates of Lazard Brothers and of Morgan, Grenfell, and Company. 'he chief backbone of this organization grew up along the already •fisting financial cooperation running from the .Morgan Bank in New ork to a group of international financiers in London led by Lazard r others. Milner himself in 1901 had refused a fabulous offer, worth up ° $100,000 a year, to become one of the three partners of the Morgan ank m London, in succession to the younger J. P. Morgan who moved ° ni London to join his father in New York (eventually the vacancy ent to E. C. Grenfell, so that the London affiliate of Morgan became nown as Morgan, Grenfell, and Company). Instead, Milner became f ector of a number of public banks, chiefly the London Joint Stock an k, corporate precursor of the .Midland Bank. He became one of the S eatest political and financial powers in England, with his disciples ategically placed throughout England in significant places, such as the Worship of The Times, the editorship of The Observer, the managing e ctorship of Lazard Brothers, various administrative posts, and even a met positions. Ramifications were established in politics, high finance, • r °rd and London universities, periodicals, the civil service, and tax- exei r,pt foundations. ,. tne end of the war of 1914, it became clear that the organization of s system had to be greatly extended. Once again the task was entrusted Lionel Curtis who established, in England and each dominion, a front ganization to the existing local Round Table Group. This front or-"},{"pageNumber":967,"pageContent":"95 2  TRAGEDY AND HOPE ganization, called the Royal Institute of International Affairs, had as its nucleus in each area the existing submerged Round Table Group. In New York it was known as the Council on Foreign Relations, and was a front for J. P. .Morgan and Company in association with the very small Amer- ican Round Table Group. The American organizers were dominated by the large number of .Morgan \"experts,\" including Lamont and Beer, who had gone to the Paris Peace Conference and there became close friends with the similar group of English \"experts\" which had been recruited by the Milner group. In fact, the original plans for the Royal Institute of International Affairs and the Council on Foreign Relations were drawn up at Paris. The Council of the RIIA (which, by Curtis's energy came to bt housed in Chatham House, across St. James's Square from the Astors, and was soon known bv the name of this headquarters) and the board of the Council on Foreign Relations have carried ever since tn marks of their origin. Until i960 the council at Chatham House was dominated bv the dwindling group of Milner's associates, while the pa 1 staff members were largelv the agents of Lionel Curtis. The Round 1w for years (until 1961) was edited from the back door of Chatham Hous grounds in Ormond Yard, and its telephone came through the Chatnai House switchboard. The New York branch was dominated by the associates of the Morg a Bank. For example, in 1928 the Council on Foreign Relations had J° W. Davis as president, Paul Cravath as vice-president, and a counci thirteen others, which included Owen D. Young, Russell C. Leffingwe'' Norman Davis, Allen Dulles, George W. Wickersham, Frank L. \" A OttO Whitney Shepardson, Isaiah Bowman, Stephen P. Duggan, ana Kahn. Throughout its history the council has been associated with American Round Tablers, such as Beer, Lippmann, Shepardson, Jerome Greene. The academic figures have been those linked to Morgan, sue James T. Shotwell, Charles Seymour, Joseph P. Chamberlain, P hl |P Jessup, Isaiah Bowman and, more recently, Philip Moseley, Grayso Kirk, and Henry M. Wriston. The Wall Street contacts with these w \\* created originally from Morgan's influence in handling large aca <._ endowments.

In England the center *as the Round Table Group, while in the United States it was J. P. Morgan and Company or its local branches in Boston, Philadelphia, and Cleveland. Some rather incidental examples of the operations of this structure are very revealing, just because they are incidental. For exam- ple, it set up in Princeton a reasonable copy of the Round Table Group's chief Oxford headquarters, All Souls College. This copy, called the In- stitute for Advanced Studv, and best known, perhaps, as the refuge of Ostein, Oppcnheimer, John von Neumann, and George F. Kennan, was 0r ganized by Abraham Flexner of the Carnegie Foundation and Rocke- e \"er's General Education Board after he had experienced the delights °* All Souls while serving as Rhodes Memorial Lecturer at Oxford. The plans were largely drawn by Tom Jones, one of the Round Table's most a ctiv e intriguers and foundation administrators. the American branch of this \"English Establishment\" exerted much °J its influence through five American new spapers (The New York Times, jNew York Herald Tribune, Christian Science Monitor, the Washington 0st > and the lamented Boston Evening Transcript). In fact, the editor °/ the Christian Science Monitor was the chief American correspondent vanonymously) of The Round Table, and Lord Lothian, the original editor of The Round Table and later secretary of the Rhodes Trust ^'925-1939) and ambassador to Washington, was a frequent writer in e Monitor. It might be mentioned that the existence of this Wall Street, V^glo-American axis is quite obvious once it is pointed out. It is re- acted in the fact that such Wall Street luminaries as John W. Davis, ewis Douglas, Jock Whitney, and Douglas Dillon were appointed to e American ambassadors in London. This double international network in which the Round Table groups ° r nied the semisecret or secret nuclei of the Institutes of International Chairs was extended into a third network in 1925, organized by the same P e °ple for the same motives. Once again the mastermind was Lionel Mwis, and the earlier Round Table Groups and Institutes of International ^uairs were used as nuclei for the new network. However, this new r ganization for Pacific affairs was extended to ten countries, while the ^ound Table Groups existed onlv in seven. The new additions, ultimately nir >a, Japan, France, the Netherlands, and Soviet Russia, had Pacific ouncils set up from scratch. In Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, aeifl c councils, interlocked and dominated by the Institutes of Interna- •onal Affairs, were set up. In England, Chatham House served as the Eng- lis! center for both nets, while in the United States the two were parallel Nations (not subordinate) of the Wall Street allies of the Morgan"},{"pageNumber":969,"pageContent":"954  TRAGEDY AND HOPE Bank. The financing came from the same international banking groups and their subsidiary commercial and industrial firms. In England, Chat- ham House was financed for both networks by the contributions of Sir Abe Bailey, the Astor family, and additional funds largely acquired by the persuasive powers of Lionel Curtis. The financial difficulties of the IPR Councils in the British Dominions in the depression of 1929-193' resulted in a very revealing effort to save money, when the local Insti- tute of International Affairs absorbed the local Pacific Council, both or which were, in a way, expensive and needless fronts for the local Round Table groups. The chief aims of this elaborate, semisecret organization were largely commendable: to coordinate the international activities and outlooks of all the English-speaking world into one (which would largely, it is ti' ue > be that of the London group); to work to maintain the peace; to help backward, colonial, and underdeveloped areas to advance toward stabil- ity, law and order, and prosperity along lines somewhat similar to thos taught at Oxford and the University of London (especially the Schoo of Economics and the Schools of African and Oriental Studies). These organizations and their financial backers were in no sense rea tionary or Fascistic persons, as Communist propaganda would like depict them. Quite the contrary.

The Eighty-third Congress 1,1 July 1953 set up a Special Committee to Investigate Tax-Exempt foundations with Representative B. Carroll Reece, of Tennessee, as chairman. It soon became clear that people of immense wealth would \" e unhappy if the investigation went too far and that the \"most re- jected\" newspapers in the countrv, closely allied with these men of health, would not get excited enough about any relevations to make the Publicity worth while, in terms of votes or campaign contributions.

Wormser, wrote a shocked, but not shocking, book on the subject called Fonvda- \"Ons: Their Poiver and Influence. ^ne of the most interesting members of this Anglo-American power structure was Jerome D. Greene (1874-1959). Born in Japan of mission- ar V parents, Greene graduated from Harvard's college and law school bv '°99 and became secretary to Harvard's president and corporation in '9oi-io I0 . This gave him contacts with Wall Street which made him S er >eral manager of the Rockefeller Institute (1910-1912), assistant to John D. Rockefeller in philanthropic work for two years, then trustee 0 the Rockefeller Institute, to the Rockefeller Foundation, and to the Rockefeller General Education Board until 1939. For fifteen years ^'917-1932) he was with the Boston investment banking firm of Lee, \" l gginson, and Company, most of the period as its chief officer, as well as with its London branch. As executive secretary of the American sec- '°n of the Allied Maritime Transport Council, stationed in London in '9>8, he lived in Toynbee Hall, the world's first settlement house, which nad been founded by Alfred Milner and his friends in 1884. This brought \"n in contact with the Round Table Group in England, a contact which as strengthened in 1919 when he was secretary to the Reparations Com- mission at the Paris Peace Conference.

He was also director of the Harvard Tercentenary Celebration in 1934-1937. Greene is of much greater significance in indicating the real influences within the Institute of Pacific Relations than any Communists or fellow travelers. He wrote the constitution for the IPR in 1926, was for years the chief conduit for Wall Street funds and influence into the organiza- tion, was treasurer of the American Council for three years, and chairman for three more, as well as chairman of the International Council for four years.

Four months later, at the request of the commission, the air force was ordered to begin a continuous monitoring of the upper atmosphere to te st for radioactive particles which would indicate if a nuclear explosion \"ad taken place anywhere in the world. The monitoring service was tested on our own nuclear explosions in the Marshall Islands early in '948, and continued thereafter on funds from AEC. Late in August 1949, a B--J9, modified for this service, returned to its base in the Far East and found that the photographic plates it had been carrying to a great height were covered with streaks.

In 1927 a young Austrian, r 'tz Houtermans, studying physics at Gottingen, took a walk with Lord Rutherford's assistant, Geoffrey Atkinson.

In io35 Gamow invited the Hungarian refugee scientist Edward Teller to join him at George Washington. They worked together and talked a good deal about the problem of hydrogen fusion. After listening to them, an- other refugee, Hans Bethe, winner of the Enrico Fermi award in 19^' then at Cornell, worked out the now accepted equations for nuclear fusion on the sun. Bethe's equations assumed that Carbon-12, by the addition of hydrogen nuclei (protons), one at a time, was raised through Nitrogen- 13, N-14, Oxygen-15, and N-15 which then added a final proton and split into C-12 and Helium-4. The carbon thus acted as a catalyst for the fusion of hydrogen to form helium. Teller, a restless man, fertile with suggestions, but incapable of sus- tained cooperation with others, went to Columbia University in 194I1 t0 Chicago in 1942, to Berkeley, California, in the summer of 1942, and to Los Alamos in the spring of 1943. He was obsessed with the idea of a fusion bomb and was greatly encouraged by Oppenheimer who ob- tained special security clearance for him and invited him both to Cal»\" fornia in 1942 and to Los Alamos in 1943.

In 1942 Fermi suggested tna such fusion could be achieved at a somewhat lower temperature by ing heavy hydrogen (deuterium).

By the end of '942, it seemed clear that the most feasible way to make a bomb would e to use both deuterium and tritium. Collisions of these at over 100 mil- ion degrees of temperature should give helium atoms and enormous ene rgy. At that point the project was put on the shelf, and work concen- trated on making the A-bomb, which had to be obtained first. After the war ended, the outstanding scientists gradually returned to ^ ei r peacetime teaching and research, so that the AEC laboratories, in- uding Los Alamos, quieted down. The superpatriots subsequently crit- 1Cl zed the scientists for this, arguing that the latter should have stayed on the job with AEC to develop better weapons than the Russians. This nonsense, and is most nonsensical when it is implied that the scientists' J^uctance for weapon development was based on Soviet sympathies. n e fact is that America's whole future depended on getting scientists a ck to the universities to train new scientists, a job which had been ne glected for five years. Moreover, there was another and potent influ- c e working against weapons development in the nuclear area. This was the air force. 1 he air force could keep its monopoly of atomic weapons only as long s these remained in the large, ungainly shape they had first had in 1945. Cc ordingly, the air force, through General Brereton's participation on n AEC committee at the end of 1947, was able to block AEC develop- ent of smaller, tactical atom bombs. Only three years later, when these er e being developed in spite of its opposition, did the air force try to Capture its privileged nuclear monopoly by beginning to insist on e velopment of the H-bomb. This shift brought it into alliance with e \"er who had been vainly advocating the H-bomb all the time since '942. Ironically enough, once this alliance had been made, sympathizers and lj es of both the air force and of Teller conveniently forgot the former's anier opposition to nuclear weapons development and began to question e loyalty of others who had opposed development of the H-bomb, in- c u ding those \"official scientists\" who had done so because they realized Would jeopardize the development of tactical A-bombs. Because he °°perated in this attack on Oppenheimer, Teller's prestige among Cle ntists (but not among congressmen and journalists) was almost ir- re parably damaged. The turn toward the H-bomb began in 1949, even before \"Joe I,\" ar gely because of the agitations of Teller and his supporters in the Cali- °rni a Radiation Laboratory led by E. O.

In general, the Bulletin of Atomic Scientist (BAS) group were reluctant to work for either change. Until 195°' however, the development of smaller A-bombs was prevented by ttie air-force veto of 1947. As a result, the only testing of A-bombs in the five-year period from Bikini in 1946 to April 1951 was a test at Enivvcto in the spring of 1948 which sought to secure larger bombs by more effective use of nuclear material. At these 1948 tests four bombs were exploded, reaching a size of over 100 kilotoris, or almost six times the blast of the 1945 bombs on Japan. This lack of testing from 194 8 t0 1951, for which the air force was responsible, was later attributed by air-force supporters to Oppenheimer's Communist sympathies! \"Joe 1\" brought this stalemate to a crisis. The question of proceeding toward an H-bomb was submitted to the Advisory Committee (GAU of the AEC in October, and this group, including Oppenheimer, Conan, Fermi, Lee DuBridge (president of California Institute of Technology/' I. I. Rabi of Columbia (Nobel Prize, 1944), and three businessmen, vote unanimously against a crash program to make an H-bomb. Glenn » e borg (Nobel Prize, 1951)1 who was absent, was noncommittal. The mo vigorous opposition came from Conant. In general, the opposition * e that concentration on an all-out effort to make an H-bomb, whose feasw bility was very dubious, would be a poor response to \"Joe I\" and tha a better response would lie in: (1) complete reform of American groun forces, including universal military training; (2) reorganization 01 » defenses of Western Europe, including Germany; and (3) a drive make a large and varied assortment of A-bombs, especially by decreasing their size for tactical use. Teller was chagrined at this decision, a view which was shared \\ Senator Brien McAIahon of the joint congressional committee and by air force. Teller had been visiting about the country, in his impetus ., way, even before this decision, seeking to build up support for \"Sup e and to recruit scientists, with special attention to Bethe (who opp os the effort to make an H-bomb and finally joined the effort, the following year, because he hoped to prove it was impossible).  ,  The GAC's unanimous vote against a crash program for the H-b° in October 1949 was based on a number of considerations, which s seem valid: (1) The scientists feared that the use of the Hanford actors to make tritium from lithium, instead of continuing to &f plutonium from uranium, would jeopardize the development of tacti A-bombs, especially as the manufacture of a pound of tritium would C the loss of 80 pounds of plutonium; (2) they felt that the threat 01 ° ^ nuclear retaliation was not a sufficient guarantee against nibbling .

These considerations, which so deeply disturbed Conant, Oppenheimer, -uienthal, and others, were ignored by Teller and his allies, who con- tinued to agitate for a crash program for \"Super.\" The strong support which Teller found in the air force, from the joint congressional com- mittee under Senator AlcMahon, and from William Liscum Borden, ex- ec utive director of the joint committee, eventually led President Truman 0 reverse the GAC. On January 31, 1950, the President gave a decision which has frequently been misrepresented: he ordered the AEC to pro- ee u with its efforts to make the H-bomb and at the same time to con- •nue its work for more varied A-weapons, within the framework of a e w over-all survey of American strategic plans which was simultaneously r uered from the National Security Council. This triple order, which s Usually misrepresented as the single order for a crash H-bomb effort, Quired new nuclear reactors. 1 he order to make an H-bomb was easier to issue than to carry out, ^Eause no one knew how to make it. It must be clearly understood that ne H-bomb, as tested in November 1952 and subsequently developed, ' as not based on the lines being followed by Teller in 1946-1951. The ri] e sequence of events has been concealed under enormous waves of j 1 ' 50 propaganda which have tried to show that Teller's development of , e H-bomb was held up because the Truman Administration was deeply nitrated with Communists and fellow travelers.

On February 24th the Joint Chiefs of Staff demanded that Truman's order to the AEC \"to continue\" work on the H-bomb be changed into a \"crash program.\" About the same time, the White House ordered the reevaluation of our strategic position by the National Secur- ity Council; this led eventually to NSC 68. And, finally, the AEC i n ' itiated steps to obtain new nuclear reactors. Work on these, begun in 1951, included a tritium production plant on the Savannah River an two U-235 gaseous-diffusion plants at Portsmouth, Ohio, and Paducan, Kentucky. This gave five great nuclear centers, of which the three dif- fusion plants used 5.8 million kilowatts of electricity, about half tne total output of the TVA, and sufficient for the ordinary needs of 3 2 million persons. In i960 this electricity cost over a quarter of a billi° dollars, and the total cost of nuclear explosives was running at $2 bill' 011 a year. The method pursued to achieve a thermonuclear explosion up to J un 1951, by fusing tritium and deuterium into helium, was possible & scientific experiment, and was achieved at the beautiful atoll of Eniweto in April 1951. But this method could not be used for a bomb, since tn whole mechanism had to be enclosed in a complex refrigerator the si of a small house. The problem of the bomb was to get the hydrog e isotope particles close enough together so that they would fuse. * could be done at the almost unobtainable temperatures over 400 mil\" 0 degrees. It could be done at lower temperatures if the particles we already close together, as they would be when very cold. As hydrog gets colder, it liquefies at —42 3 ° below zero Fahrenheit, but it 1SVC /, difficult to keep it that cold. It can be kept at the temperature of hq 11 air, —414 0 F., by immersing it in this, but at that temperature, 9° big 1 . than its own vaporizing point, hydrogen will stay liquid only « under pressure of about 2,700 pounds per square inch. The successful hydrogen fusion at Eniwetok in April, 195'' % achieved with a very small quantity of tritium and deuterium held these fantastic conditions, then suddenly exposed to the ioo-mi\"i degree blast of an exploding A-bomb. The additional energy release J the fusing hydrogen was so small that it was not noticeable to eye^ nesses, but could be inferred from the electronic recording appa ra Thus it would be a mistake to call this explosion, known as Ope fa Greenhouse, an H-bomb.

As Oppenheimer sai d, \"It was sweet.\" Briefly, the idea was to merge the two separate operations of making tritium out of lithium and fusing the tritium with euterium into a single operation as a bomb. The feasibility of this new P an w as tested in a successful thermonuclear explosion (called \"Mike\") *f part of the tests of Operation Ivy at Eniwetok on November 1, 1952. \"is produced a blast equal to about 10 million tons of TNT, creating a nreball 3 y 2 miles wide, whose heat was felt 30 miles away, and which completely destroyed the small islet on which it occurred, leaving a hole m the lagoon 175 feet deep and a mile wide. But this was not a bdmb, ln ce the mechanism weighed 65 tons and filled a cubical box 25 feet on ea ch edge. Ihe great significance of the thermonuclear bomb was that, unlike tte A-bomb, it could be made of limitless power. An A-bomb explosion w as measured in thousands of tons of TNT (kilotons) and could be jfiade up to a few hundred kilotons in power. The thermonuclear bomb a d to be measured in millions of tons of TNT (megatons) and had n ° limit on its size. Ihe world's third thermonuclear explosion was a shocker, exploded y the Russians on August 12, 1953, and revealed to the world by Amer- can atmosphere-testing devices. It may have been dropped from a plane; So > the Russians were far in advance of us, since we did not achieve a droppable bomb until May 21, 1956. In that interval we exploded, at •kini on March 1, 1954, our first real thermonuclear bomb. It was a orrifyirig device, a triple-stage fission-fusion-fission bomb which spread e ath-dealing radioactive contamination over more than 8,000 square miles of the Pacific and injurious radiation over much of the world. This first American thermonuclear bomb had a trigger of two A-bombs ex ploded simultaneously to detonate a second stage consisting of Lithium- Qeuteride. This latter was a compound of a lithium isotope of mass 6 l which makes up about one-fifteenth of natural lithium and has a nucleus ot three protons with three neutrons) and of heavy Hydrogen-2. This compound, a white crystalline substance, was surrounded with a shiny phere of almost a ton of metallic natural uranium. The neutrons from ne A-bomb trigger, blasting through the lithium deuterium crystals, s P ] it the Lithium-6 into helium and tritium (Hydrogen-3); in a tre- mendous explosion, the latter then fused with the deuterium to make e hum, at the same time emitting a great shower of extra neutrons which P'lt the surrounding natural uranium in a superatomic fission holocaust, he whole process occurred almost instantaneously, with a shattering •ast equal to 18,000,000 tons of TNT. With the blast was released a ast quantity of deadly radioactive isotopes, including the dangerous"},{"pageNumber":981,"pageContent":"966  TRAGEDY AND HOPE Strontium-90, which, like calcium, is readily absorbed into human bones, where its deadly radiations may easily engender cancer. The test of this inhuman weapon (called \"Bravo\") was announced to the world by the AEC as the test of an H-bomb (it was really a U-bom<>- or a \"fission-fusion-fission bomb\"), and for almost a year (until February 15, 1955) its real nature was concealed by the AEC, apparently at x \" c insistence of the new Republican chairman, Lewis L. Strauss.

This, of course, was not be- lieved by the atomic scientists, but seemed convincing to many we informed persons from the strange fact that William L. Laurence, science editor of The Netv York Times, spread these two mistaken ideas^ As the best-known scientific journalist in America, Laurence's stone were accepted as true by the ordinary well-informed public (thoug not by scientists). Laurence, the only newspaper reporter allowed to se the test at Alamagordo or the nuclear explosion on Japan, wrote a boo on the H-bomb, which he called The Hell Bomb, in 1950. It was full 0 misleading ideas, forgivable at that date, but totally erroneous in follo^\" ing years, when the book continued to be read. It stated that the H-bon 1 would be exploded bv direct fusion of deuterium and tritium, a metn° which it attributed to Teller. Years later, in The New York Times, Laurence still insisted that the test of March, 1954, was not a fissio fusion-fission (F-F-F-bomb) but was simply a fission-fusion H-bomb a not a U-bomb. This version of \"Bravo\" apparently originated \\ vl Strauss, who denied that \"Bravo\" was a U-bomb, and explained the su prisinglv large noxious fallout as a consequence of irradiation of r coral reef on which the bomb exploded. This story entrenched in public mind that Teller was the \"Father of the H-bomb,\" that he ' ia been held back to the injury of American security by Soviet sympat' 11 ers during the Truman Administration, and that there was some &a for the AEC condemnation of Oppenheimer as a security risk in J u 1954. Behind much of this was the air force, allied to Teller, Lauren < and Strauss, and very opposed to Oppenheimer. This opposition aro because of Oppenheimer's work for diversification of weapons (*** was regarded by the air force as a treasonable diversion of both mo . and nuclear materials from it to the other services) and for his en<> to get smaller nuclear warheads. These latter paved the way f° r l0 ^ range missiles, for tactical nuclear weapons, and for the Polaris nuC submarine which supplanted the air force manned bombers and, by middle 1960^, threatened to shift America's primary deterrence of 5° aggression from SAC to the navv."},{"pageNumber":982,"pageContent":"I hei NUCLEAR RIVALRY AND THE COLD WAR: 1950-1957 967 It should he recorded that Teller had little to do with the actual mak- ln g of the successful thermonuclear bomb. As usual, he was very restless and felt hampered at Los Alamos in 1951 and spent most of his time °°bying with the air force and the Radiation Laboratory trying to get new second-weapons laboratory of his own. To free himself for this activity, he left Los Alamos in November 1951. When the AEC refused 0 establish a second laboratory, Teller went to the air force and obtained s support for a second-weapons laboratory, the so-called Livermore Laboratory attached to E. O.

Teller himself was present at none of the tests of the lithium oni b, and his Livermore Laboratory did not participate in the tests. ^>one of this was in fact as it was built up in public opinion in the period 1951-1955. The public record on these matters was rectified in 955 by Teller, by Laurence, and by the AEC, but by that time Oppen- n^er had been condemned, the Republicans were in office, and the or V of subversion in the American government had become an es- abhshed American myth, along with the thermonuclear bomb as a hy- dr °gen bomb and Teller as its father. * hese myths were, of course, not believed by the nuclear scientists, a * ct that helped to intensify the suspicion the radical Right held for \"em and for all educated people. The truth about \"Bravo\" had been ev ealed to the nuclear scientists of the world, including the Russians, most immediately after the test and in a most dramatic fashion, shortly after the \"Bravo\" blast at Bikini, a small Japanese fishing boat, \" e Lucky Dragon, was caught in the edge of the lethal radiations from e test. It was, indeed a lucky Dragon for only one of the crew subse- quently died, although the rest were sick for months. The vessel was lr >ety miles east of the blast, but, had it been only ten miles farther \"th, all the crew would have died horrible deaths. Two weeks after e blast, when the doomed vessel reached Japan, Professor Kenjiro •mura, the first discoverer of Uranium-237, found this rare isotope in le fallout ash all over The Lucky Dragon. The U-237 could have come y from fission of U-239.

Late in 1952, immediately following the test of \"Mike. John von Neumann headed a committee which recommended an l0 \" tensified effort to develop a long-range missile (ICBM). At that time the American effort in missiles was restricted very largely to variations of the German V-z weapon and to lesser rockets such as Aerobee an Wac Corporal. The new effort soon showed that longer range would oe easier to achieve than greater accuracy and that it would be very difficult to build a missile which could be depended upon to hit wit\" 1 ten miles of target. At such a distance, blast, even at ten megatons, woul do little damage, and if such targets were to be knocked out, this woul have to be done bv a spreading cloud of radioactive fallout and not 0) the blast. Hence the U-bomb. The U-bomb, concealed from public view by secrecy and by mis* leading statements from AEC, usually from Strauss, remained the weapo of last resort in the American arsenal throughout the Dulles era. n launching of the first \"Polaris\" submarine in January 1954, six weeks be- fore \"Bravo,\" did not change this situation. The first American test 0 an airdrop lithium bomb in .May 1956 was a delayed fall from a »\"5 jet bomber at 55,000 feet; it exploded at 15,000 feet in a four-mile-'\"' 1 fireball, but was almost an equal distance off its target. To prepare public opinion to accept use of the U-bomb, if it becarn necessary, Strauss sponsored a study of radioactive fallout whose cone sion was prejudged by calling it \"Project Sunshine.\" By selective relea of some evidence and strict secrecy of other information, the Str8 group tried to establish in public opinion that there was no real dang to anyone from nuclear fallout even in all-out nuclear war.

I he end of the American nuclear monopoly in late 1950 made neces- ^ r y a reopening of the strategic debate which had been stabilized on the ruman doctrine of \"containment\" in 1947. \"Containment\" strategy was a sed on a strategic balance between Soviet mass armies and the Amer- a n nuclear monopoly, in which each of these would deter use of the fler ! thus establishing an umbrella under which the United States u 'd use its economic power to win the Cold War. The strategic bal- ce had been established as the \"Truman Doctrine\" early in 1947 and been followed by the containment weapon, in aid to Greece and r *ey and, above all, by the Marshall Plan. This policy in the years 947-1950 won numerous victories for the West, all along the Soviet-bloc r e nphery and especially in West Germany and in Japan, both of which Ca me solidly attached to the West. The major failure, justified as in- itable in terms of the magnitude of the problem and the resources ailable, was the loss of China to the Soviet bloc, but this was generally acc epted by the supporters of containment on the double ground that e Mailable resources must go to Europe (as more important than China) that China would never be a strong or dependable satellite of Russia. *his doctrine of containment, by depriving each side of its strongest H ' e apon (the Soviet mass armv and the American SAC force) tended to cralize these and forced each side into supplementary strategic plans. , Che Soviet side, these new plans involved the use of nibbling tactics j its satellites. On the American side, these new plans involved the de- • °P r nent of a balanced and flexible defensive posture based on all serv- es and weapons. he new Soviet plans required a diversion of American aims from the let Union itself to its periphery and to its satellites. They also in- Ve d keeping aggression below the level which would trigger a SAC a |'ation. This level was much higher for a satellite state than for the , let Union itself. In fact, while almost any military aggression by ySSR might trigger a SAC nuclear strike in return, almost no ag- j ssi0n by a satellite (especially a lesser satellite) would do so. The areas which such indirect adventures by the USSR might take place were I0US: the Near East and the Far East.

The dispute arose from the fact that MacArthur Icl not accept his government's strategic and political plans, and sch- ematically sought to undermine and redirect them, while in constant ° n iniunication with the press and with the leaders of the opposition Political party for this purpose.

Because of lack of American troops for an attac across the width of the peninsula, he divided his forces into two separate- attacks on either side of the peninsula with no direct liaison between t two where a considerable gap was left. Moreover, MacArthur on Octoue 24th canceled the restrictions on use of non-Korean forces close to tn Chinese and Russian borders. His special communique of November 5th which opened his northward offensive spoke of it as one which wou for \"all practical purposes end the war\" and bring the United Nations forces \"home bv Christmas.\" Until November 26th the MacArthur offensive rolled northwar against only moderate resistance, but, just as it reached the Yalu frontier at some points, a gigantic Chinese offensive of 33 divisions counte attacked into the gap between the two UN wings. Mac Arthur's communique of November 28th spoke of the Chin attack as a \"new war,\" which \"has shattered the high hopes we enter- tained that the intervention of the Chinese was only of a token nature 0 a volunteer and individual basis. . . .\" At once he began an intensi propaganda campaign both to obtain his earlier aims for direct attacks 0 coastal China and air attacks on interior points and to rewrite the histor) of the preceding month so that his own actions would seem to be p meditated and skilled ripostes to Chinese plans. In fact, his public stat ment of November 28th was in sharp contrast with his private messag to Washington almost four weeks earlier which estimated the Chin forces across the Yalu as half a million men in 56 regular army divisio supported by 370,000 district security forces. In the face of sn knowledge, no excuse can be found for MacArthur's use of a CUV* command with a central gap to attack toward such a force. The Chinese attack in MacArthur's mind reduced the American situ tion in the Far East to a simple choice between two extreme alternativ either all-out war on China, and possibly Russia, to destroy world Co munism once for all or the immediate evacuation of our forces tr Korea.

On this basis a Powerful attack was built up against Secretary of State Acheson, against 1 AiO and other American commitments in Europe, and against foreign °r any efforts to extend x\\merica's ground forces. Truman's efforts Se nd four divisions to Europe and to make General Eisenhower Su- \" e rne Commander of NATO were violently opposed, by Taft (who had ot ed against ratification of NATO) and by Senator Wherry, the Re- L °\"can floor leader. Every effort was made to reduce the defense of the ai ted States to a simple matter of control of the air and the oceans 'thout need for overseas forces or overseas allies.

At Washington's airport, arte midnight on April 19th, the crowds broke out of control. That aiys noon, before a joint session of Congress and over a nationwide televisio broadcast, he made a speech which ranged from old-fashioned eloquen to pure ham. It ended on pathos: \"Old soldiers never die, they just W away.

This was twice crowd which had seen Eisenhower's return from Europe after the dele of Germany in 1945. The general did not fade away immediately. By May he was back 1 Washington as star witness for the prosecution in a congressional Hive tigation into the country's Far East policies. Only an infinitesimal iff tion of those who had cheered the general so heartily two weeks hero paid any attention to the hearings. This was unfortunate. AlacAi'tn seriously maintained that his policies could lead to the total defeat Communist China, without any increase in ground forces, simply . naval and economic blockade of China, by air attack on Chinese industry and by \"lifting the wraps\" off Chiang Kai-shek. On this basis he promise immediate victory with a minimum of risk and casualties. The Admi\"* tration's policy, he insisted, was not victory but \"to go on indecisive; fighting with no mission for the troops except to resist and fight • • • continued and indefinite extension of bloodshed.\" Subsequent testimony from others, including the country's Ieadi g military experts and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, showed the unsubstanti nature of this vision of Utopia. They rejected MacArthur's ideas as u realistic and impossible: the bombing of Manchuria alone would ta twice as many bombers as SAC had available; bombing of Chinese in du try would not deprive the Chinese of military supplies, as their arsena were in the Soviet Union; an economic and naval blockade could 1 seriously injure a country as self-sufficient as China, with an open la frontier, and could not be effective at all unless active military combat the ground increased consumption rates; efforts to adopt these p°' lC , would alienate the United States from its allies and the United Nations a would jeopardize the whole anti-Soviet position in Europe."},{"pageNumber":994,"pageContent":"NUCLEAR RIVALRY AND THE COLD WAR: 1950-1957 979 Few Americans followed the arguments to this point, but MacArthur had given the opposition a new war cry: \"In war there is no substitute for victory.\" This slogan, in which neither war nor victory was defined, was Use d as a weapon by the neo-isolationists, partisan Republicans, and Radi- Ca ' Right for more than a decade, although by i960 it had been shortened 0 the charge that the Democrats favored a \"No-win policy.\" After a e cade of reiteration, many persons seriously believed that it was im- possible to stop Communism without all-out nuclear war and that con- ln ued survival, instead of mutual destruction, could not possibly be garded as winning!

In the face of the public opinion of 1950-195 2, the Truman Admin- istration had to make some concessions to the power of neo-isolationism. ne loyalty program to ferret out subversives was established in the s°vernment; during the Mac Arthur hearings of May 1951, Dean Acheson Promised that, under no circumstances, would Red China be accepted into he community of nations; aid and support to Chiang was increased; and John Foster Dulles was brought into the State Department. None of lc se changes helped the Truman Administration's popularity, as was early shown in the election of 1952, but they had major repercussions n history. One of these was Dulles's success in obtaining a peace treaty for Japan (September 8, 1951). Dulles, like the Columbia presidency, was a former Morgan satel- e which had been lost, about the same time and for the same reasons. ^ s a partner in Sullivan and Cromwell, one of the Wall Street legal firms c osely associated with Morgan, Dulles operated very much in the Morgan ^neyard until the late 1940's. An early advocate of bipartisanship in °teign affairs (a W 7 all Street specialty), he was first brought into Demo- ra tic State Department circles, largely under Morgan sponsorship, in '945* as adviser to Secretary of State Stettinius at the San Francisco Con- er ence. These associations continued, at various meetings and confer- ees, mostly at the United Nations and at the four postwar Foreign • ''rasters' conferences of 1945-1949. \"Ut in 1948 a change occurred when Dulles's naturally exaggerated per- n al ambition got out of hand at the same time that he drifted out of the Wa ll Street constellations with which his whole career had been asso- rted.

The marks this change were his appointment to the United States Senate by Gov- r nor Dewey of New York in July 1949 and his resignation from Sul- v an and Cromwell at that time.

This movement was marked by increas- ing neglect of Europe and opposition to our chief allies there and u>\" creasing concern with the Far East and the curative powers of strategi nuclear bombing. The Japanese peace treaty was one of the last constructive aclu eve ' ments of Dulles and was reached without support of the Soviet Uni° n ' which refused to sign it. Communist China was also excluded. »\" treaty's chief aim was to end the Pacific war within a larger secure) structure which bound the previous enemies into a mutual security system- It had three parts: the peace treaty with Japan, which accepted its loS of the already detached areas and islands; the ANZUS Treaty, w' llC ' allied Australia, New Zealand, and the United States; and a bilatera mutual defense pact between Japan and the United States. The neo-isolationist surge in American public opinion so paral\\' ze the freedom of action of the Truman Administration that it was unao to negotiate any settlement of the war in Korea. Every effort at neg tiation gave rise to howls of \"appeasement\" or \"treason.\" Moreover, t 1 Communists, while willing to negotiate, showed no eagerness to make a agreement, with the result that negotiations crawled along for nv years in the isolated military quarters at Panmunjon in Korea. The Krem lin was quite willing to keep America's men, money, and attention 0 down in Korea, and could find each day an additional argument to thro as an obstacle into the negotiations. Most of these obstacles were c° cerned with the disposition of prisoners of war, thousands of whom not want to return to Communist territory, while only twenty- 0 ' captured Americans were unwilling to return to the United States. Simp 1 ) by insisting that all prisoners must be forced to return, the Communis could extend the negotiations indefinitely in time and thus postpone day when the United States might be free to turn its men and resourc to other areas closer to the Soviet Union and thus more dangerous to such as Europe. Only the death of Stalin in March 1953 broke this stalemate.

In a military sense, this in- 'tably led to efforts to increase the abilitv of Europe and America ^'age limited war, whatever the cost.

From their discussions emerged a series of scientific research projects in 1951-195 2 which had a profound effect on American defense capabili- ties. Project Vista, with President Lee DuBridge of Caltech as chairman and Lauritsen as his deputy, made an over-all study of defense prob- lems for the Department of Defense. In general it sought to reach a well- rounded, diverse defense establishment which could respond effective!) to any degree of aggression and do it on land, sea, or air. One 01 1 chief efforts was to get tactical air power for the ground forces and to counteract the massed Soviet Army in Europe by development of tacti- cal nuclear weapons, as well as nuclear warheads to be carried on rocke of 50- to 300-mile range, so that the forcible dispersion of Russian infan- try to avoid annihilation would sharply reduce its offensive impact. 1 neS weapons could also be used to get \"all-weather\" tactical bombing sup- port under army control to replace the fair-weather air-force tactic bombing which had proved so ineffective in Korea. The Vista Report, which was submitted to the secretaries of the force in February 1952, made at least a dozen suggestions of which at l ea ten were eventually carried out, despite the fact that the report was nev accepted. The reason for its rejection was the violent opposition 01 t air force, which disliked most of it but really exploded when they fou n in Chapter 5, that it recommended dividing nuclear materials among three services. The air force flatly refused to yield up any fissions materials to the other services. At first it insisted that there was enough. When months of argument proved there was plenty, the force simply tripled its requirements. When the air force discovered Oppenheimer had written the introductory section of Chapter 5, niS was sealed. Stories about his unreliability were passed about, and & tually it was said that he had somehow rewritten Chapter 5 and inset it without the committee members knowing what he was doing- Project Charles and its sequel Project Lincoln were equally object! ^ able to the air force, although they had been instigated by it. \"Chat suggested that a permanent research laboratory should be establish^ study the technical problems of air defense.

The cost of this program, billions of dollars, made it less than welcome to the air force. To combat it, air-force supporters spread rumors that a clique of scientists which they called \"ZORC\" (Zacharias, Oppenheimer, Ka °i, and Charles Lauritsen) were out to destroy SAC by devising, or Pretending to devise, a near-perfect air defense for the United States, thus DEW DAD, according to SAC supporters, would be America's Waginot Line behind which the country would lie helplessly bankrupt r °ni its cost of Si00 billion. The air force, from its control over the Lincoln Laboratory's budget, was successful in forcing MIT to suppress the DEW DAD report; at least, it was never published. But part of the st °ry, including the horror story about ZORC, was published in the May '953 issue of Fortune magazine, and some of the rest came out in the '954 hearing on Oppenheimer's security. 1 he third significant effort in the scientists' campaign for American survival in the early 1950's was known as Project East River. It was also uistigated by the air force, early in 1952, and studied the problem of e 'vil defense through a scientific team headed by Lloyd Berkner of Asso- rted Universities. It advocated a fantastically expensive program of lr -raid warnings, civilian defense shelters, and radar decentralization, ut little was ever done about it. Since such a defensive system would 'Woubtedly save scores of millions of lives in any all-out nuclear war, an d would permit the United States to withstand a Soviet \"first strike,\" ne failure to follow up these recommendations is clearly attributable to . e c ost, a sum which many felt we could not afford and which the lr force was convinced could be far better spent on building up the °ttensive power of SAC.

This advocated rejection of \"containment\" in favor of \"liberation,\" to be achieved on a smaller budget and with reduc- tion of the armed forces leading to a conclusive victory in the near future. All concessions to reality were rejected out of hand: containment itself Was damned as fragmentary reactions to Soviet pressure, as negative, end- le ss, and partial, as \"treadmill policies which, at best, might perhaps keep Us m the same place until we drop exhausted.\" In place of these, Dulles offered liberation and massive retaliation. These two were not expressly •mked together since, apparently, the former (applied chiefly to eastern Europe) would be achieved simply by making clear that the United States wanted it. At least, Dulles believed it would come when American policy made \"it publicly known that it wants and expects liberation to occur.\" The disastrous consequence of this nonsense appeared in 1956 When East Germany and Hungary rose against the Russians and were cr ushed by Soviet tanks without Dulles raising a hand to help. The \"feat of instant massive retaliation as the sole weapon by which the Un ited States would get Russia to adopt more acceptable policies was ^ually unrealistic. No one, not even Dulles, dared to use it in the face the Soviet Union's capability for retaliation.

Fully aware of his own limitations of bot knowledge and energy, Eisenhower allotted the functions of governmen to his Cabinet members (\"eight millionaires and a plumber,\" according to one writer) and expected to be consulted himself only in unsettle disputes or major policy changes. Over-all government operations were divided into two parts, with J° n Foster Dulles, as secretary of state, in charge of foreign affairs, and ex- Governor Sherman Adams of New Hampshire (in place of Taft, v \" died in 1953) as assistant President in charge of domestic matters.

The chief aim the Administration, and almost the sole aim of these three, was to redu government spending, and subsequently business taxes, by the great amount that would not jeopardize reelection in 1956.

If h c gave the impression that he had no firmlv held convictions, at was because of two other qualities: he was relaxed, fully willing 0 we and let live, in an easvgoing tolerance of anything which did ot disturb his own peace of mind. He was quick-tempered but not a ghter. He had convictions, none of them very firm, but he was not prepared to sacrifice his own rest and relaxation for them, except for rie f occasions. His span of attention was neither long nor intense. As a ° nse quence, he was a wonderful companion, but not a leader, hi a l] this, the President was the antithesis of his secretary of state. John Foster Dulles was a tireless and energetic fighter, full of convic- ts, most of which he saw in black-and-white terms. He rarelv rested n \" had little time for any relaxation because the world was full of *u forces with which he must wage constant battle. Tolerance and the '£ht to be neutral were to him largely words which had little real e aning in his tightly wound neurological svstem. To Dulles it was a ^al effort not to equate opposition with evil. As he hurried throughout \" e world, traveling 226,645 miles in his first three vears in office, in Pursuit of Communism, he was like John Wesley, two centuries earlier, aeing through England in pursuit of sin, both men fully convinced \" a t they were doing the work of God. Eisenhower, who saw the world as a place almost without evil, once told an adviser, \"You and I can ar gue issues all day and it won't affect our friendship, but the minute I M Ue stion your motives you will never forgive me.\" This lesson would av e been lost on the secretarv of state, for Dulles, almost alone in a w °rld full of sin, was always seeking the reason behind the event, the motive behind the action, and was obligated bv his own alignment with Rhteousness to denounce the reason and the motive when he had discovered them. \" must be evident from this that Eisenhower and Dulles, in spite their close cooperation and almost unruffled personal relations, were . r y dissimilar, both in personality and in outlook.

To avoid this, the Administration had to do two basically contra- dictory things: to make verbal concessions to the Right and to nn its congressional legislative support among the Democrats. In 1953 alone, according to the Congressional Quarterly Abnanac, the \"Democrats saved the President . . . fifty-eight times\" by their votes in Congr eSS ' Some examples of this skirmishing, in what was locally known as the \"Battle of the Potomac,\" form a necessary background to the develop- ment of international affairs in Eisenhower's eight years. The Republican platform of July 1952 had promised to \"repudiate a pnmmirm^nrs nnnroin*»H in cprrpr iinrtarcrnnrlinrrc curh a« those Of 1311' which aid Communist enslavements.\" In his first speech as secretary Dulles spoke of the liberation of satellite peoples, and told them, »° can count upon us.\" The Republicans in Congress from then on k e P demanding support of these two promises, beginning with a resolutio to repudiate Yalta and Potsdam. The Administration naturally ha<* oppose this congressional desire to take campaign talk seriously, SJfl any repudiation of past agreements could be done bv Russia more easi. than by us and could jeopardize most of our advanced positions Europe, beginning with Berlin and Vienna. Eventually the resolutio was dropped. A somewhat similar struggle arose over the Bricker and the substitu Dirksen Amendments to the Constitution.

Chairman Harold Yelde of the n ouse Committee on Un-American Activities at once issued a subpoena *° the ex-President to testify before the committee. The summons was •gnored. In the resulting controversy Senator McCarthy attacked the Administration over a nationwide broadcast for its failure to force all nations, beginning with Britain, to cease their trade with Red China by threatening to cut off our economic aid. We should say, \"If you continue t0 ship to Red China . . . you will not get one cent of American money.\" Hie fact that our allies provided us, at great danger to themselves, with military bases on their own soil from which our strategic pressure on the Soviet Union was maintained meant nothing to the total irrespon- sibility of the Radical Right. McCarthy's attacks on the United States information Agency overseas libraries as centers for diffusion of Leftist b °oks led to the burning of hundreds of books in these libraries and ev entual]y to attacks on works like Tom Saivyer and Robin Hood as subversive, because they did not picture middle-class Middle West American customs (Robin Hood stole from the rich and gave to the poor, clearly a Communist tactic). Such harassments of the new Administration were almost constant, specially from the Right, which was confident it had won the election °* ! 95 2 and should be obeyed as a consequence. On April 30th, in Cabinet, Taft blasted the Administration for its inability to cut more \"an $5 billion or $6 billion out of the defense budget. The foreign aid mutual-security\" budget of $7.6 billion left by Truman was cut by '-nairman John Tabor of the House Appropriations Committee to $4.4 nulion in spite of Eisenhower's request for $5.5 billion. Chairman C. W. Ke ed of the House Ways and Means Committee, despite Eisenhower's a Ppeal, knocked out the new Truman taxes of 1951 on July 1, 1953, six months before they would have ended anyway. Under Right-wing attacks such as these, Eisenhower was largely dis- 'usioned with his job bv the summer of 1953 and spent much time over tie next two years considering how he might get rid of the dominant ^ e publican Right and form a new, middle-of-the-road Eisenhower arty. The impracticality of this became apparent to him long before tn e election of 1956. * hese attacks from the Right were much less disturbing to Dulles ^an they were to the President. The Secretary of State was clear in his VVn mind on what his aims in foreign policy should be. These aims e re largely acceptable to the neo-isolationists and congressional Repub- c ans. Basic to these ideas was his conception of \"massive retaliation.\""},{"pageNumber":1007,"pageContent":"99 2  TRAGEDY AND HOPE This was publicly announced in his speech of January 12, 1954' before the Council of Foreign Relations, but had been forecast in his article in Life almost two years earlier. \"Massive retaliation\" here meant nuclear reprisal by strategic bombing. It was conceived as an alternative to limited war and was intended to be a deterrent to Soviet instigation 01 such local limited wars. The points at which it would be applied or the degree of aggression necessary to trigger it were both left ambiguous, in the hope that the threat would deter aggression in all areas and on all levels. Dulles was really rejecting the whole idea of limited war, and saw local defense only as a trigger mechanism for tripping massive retali- ation. In this view he was at one with most of the Eisenhower Adminis- tration. Secretary Wilson, for example, said, \"We can no longer afford to fight limited war.\" Of course, he was thinking in monetary terms- General Gavin, who heard this statement, replied, \"If we cannot affor to fight limited wars, then we cannot afford to survive, for that is the only kind of war we can afford to fight.\" He was thinking of the cost in terms of human lives. As a corollary to the idea of massive retaliation as deterrence, Duhe had the additional idea of local defense, and especially local alliances, as triggers. Combined with this was his refusal to accept anything but a two-bloc world, by his resolute refusal to recognize any right to anyone to be neutral. On June 9, 1956, in a speech at Iowa State College, he said that America had made bilateral treaties with forty-two countries and that these agreements \"abolish, as between the parties, the princip^ of neutrality, which pretends that a nation can best gain safety for itsel by being indifferent to the fate of others. This has increasingly becom an obsolete conception, and, except under very exceptional circum- stances, it is an immoral and shortsighted conception.\" Thus the Secre tarv of State indicated his readiness to abandon the nonaligned countrie to the Soviet bloc, and gave Stalin's successors in the Kremlin a tactica opportunity they were already exploiting. At the same time, as we sM see in a moment, Dulles's treatment of our chief allies was generally autocratic and even contemptuous that they were soon alienated, e s P cially France, which did not have the \"special relationship\" with l which kept Great Britain at our side through any slights. The reason for these actions by Dulles was that he was really an is lationist, convinced that American defense rested wholly on America strength, and, accordingly, he did not regard his treaty partners as al» at all, but rather as a part of an elaborate network of triggers surroun ing the Soviet Union. The chief portions of this network were ti» regional pacts: NATO, the Baghdad Pact (later called CENTRO, Central Treaty Organization), and SEATO (or Southeast Asian Treat) Organization). NATO included the United States, Canada, and thirtee other states from Iceland to Turkey (by May 1955)."},{"pageNumber":1008,"pageContent":"NUCLEAR RIVALRY AND THE COLD WAR: 1950-1957 993 The Baghdad Pact of 1955 was largely a Dulles creation but did not •nclude the United States. Its members were Britain, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, an d Pakistan. It was renamed Central Treaty Organization in 1959 when ra <] withdrew and the United States signed bilateral alliances with all lts members. The third pact, SEATO, signed in 1954, had eight members (United ata tes, Britain, France, New Zealand, Australia, Philippines, Thailand, and Pakistan). With Turkey acting as a link between NATO and CENTRO, and Pakistan in a similar role between CENTRO and t-ATO, the three pacts were intended to enclose the Soviet bloc in an ^broken perimeter of paper barriers which would deter a Communist Movement outward anywhere, by serving as a trigger for American retaliation. Otherwise, CENTRO' and SEATO had little military or Political merit, and created more problems than they solved. Uulles was not primarily concerned about the military strength of ese pacts or about the military contribution any of these countries c ould make to a war on the Soviet Union. Above all, he was not con- e med with any contribution of a military character the United States °uld make to the defense of these pacts or areas in any nonnuclear war. or eover, as triggers, Dulles was not much concerned with the character the regimes involved or with their military strength. Some mountain- Us country or tropical jungle of Asia was, for his purposes, about as Sl gnificant as England or France. oince England and France were already alienated by the whole idea massive retaliation, which could so easily, by some independent merican act, deluge them with Soviet nuclear bombs, they were even JWier alienated by Dulles's almost total lack of concern for the fact nat they were more cultured and more civilized than other members dulles's pacts, that they shared our common Western traditions (of ^ruch, indeed, they were the creators), and could contribute more to eir own defense with conventional weapons than could some Moslem Or r\\      ...      P a gan areas of Asia. It is no wonder that Dulles, with his unilateralism, h 's lack of concern for cultural kinship, his readiness to sacrifice all Uropean states in response to a trigger mechanism in some remote and a ckward jungle, his almost total unconcern with the possible contri- utio n 0 f limited and conventional warfare to save any areas from oniiTiunism, it is no wonder, indeed, that Dulles alienated the United ta tes from its natural associates in Western Europe to a degree hitherto nknown in the twentieth century. At the same time, Dulles alienated himself domestically from all his 01 der associations within American life, and from the forces of rational- atl °n and science which were increasingly a force there. Like Eisen- °Wer, Dulles had an unusual conception of his office; indeed, it was \"^uch more unusual than was Eisenhower's. Dulles refused to take any"},{"pageNumber":1009,"pageContent":"994  TRAGEDY AND HOPE responsibility for the internal functioning of the State Department. Hi concern was, he thought, only with the high policy of internation 3 politics on a world basis as the eyes, ears, and probably the mind of tn President. Accordingly, instead of the usual under secretary of stat, Dulles appointed two: General Walter Bedell Smith to the regular post. and Donald B. Lourie, president of Quaker Oats Company, as a secon one in charge of all departmental administration. Under Lourie he name a McCarthyite, R. W. Scott McLeod, as State Department security of- ficer. In this way the full disruptive force of McCarthyism was broug into the inner fortress, that is, into the personnel security files of ti department against which McCarthy and his associates had directed tnei most blasting assaults. Nor was that all. In his first week in office Dul announced his policies to the department, and informed its empi°y e , that he expected \"competence, discipline, and positive loyalty.\" There nothing objectionable in these three qualities except that Senator 1 Carthy had temporarily made \"positive loyalty\" his own criterion condemnation. This beginning became worse. Dulles made no effort to protect subordinates from the attacks made upon the department or on the individually. His justification for this attitude soon destroyed the mora of much of the department and especially of the Foreign Service. L> u felt that once an employee became the target of a public attack as reliable, the question of his guilt or innocence became definitely secon ary to the question of whether his value to the department had been destroyed simply by the fact that he had become a subject controversy. If so, he should be released from service, even if innoce This point of view, which was almost an invitation to the iMcCarthyitej to increase their attacks, was never, however, applied to Dulles hims when he became, in a short time, a figure of controversy. The real dam g to the Department arose from the elimination of some of its most knoN edgeable members. The Radical Right, having eliminated almost eve . one who knew anything about the Far East, especially those who k n the Chinese language, now, under Dulles, shifted their target to t who knew anything about Russia, especially the language.

A4uch of the letter Was made up of wild charges which no responsible person has ever been Willing to defend: \"He has been instrumental in securing recruits for tlle Communist Party,\" and \"He was in frequent contact with Soviet es pionage agents.\" According to Borden, \"The central problem is not Whether J.

The news was given to Oppenheimer by tra uss on December 21, 1953, four days after he received an honorary e gree from Oxford University. As provided by law, Oppenheimer a Ppealed the AEC decision to an ad hoc investigation committee of free men, one of whom was a scientist. The hearings, from April 12 to a .V 6, 1954, allowed Oppenheimer to have counsel who were permitted 0 cr oss-examine witnesses, but the conduct of the hearings was most Satisfactory. I he older assumption, which had been practiced regularly in Amer- Can history and continued, fairly generally, in the Truman Adminis- rat ion, was that any person had a right to be employed bv the govern- e nt unless something adverse could be proved against him. The chief Ve rse something, in scientific work, would be disloyalty. In the course the years 1951-1953, these concepts were changing and were formally odified by President Eisenhower's Security Order 10450 of April, 95 3- The first change was that public employment no longer was a £ nr but became a privilege; the second was that disloyalty was no tiger the chief criterion, but security was; and the third change was *at the government no longer had to prove anything derogatory, but erely needed to have a doubt that a person's employment was con- sent with the securitv of the country. aken together, these three modifications placed the burden of proof f he employee rather than on the accuser and made the area of proof Wide that it could hardly be met.

The task of an employee seeking to dispel the doubt that he may drink one too many cocktails before dinner, or that he may gossip, or even talk in his sleep is formidable. For example, one of the AEC commissioners who sat in judgment on Oppenheimer f el asleep in a railroad car on June 11, 1954, with the transcript of the case on his lap, and awoke later to find it gone. This was why the transcript was immediately printed and released on June 16th, in spite of the assurances to its forty witnesses throughout its pages that it would be kept secret. A case might be made that an AEC commissioner who l° st classified materials by falling asleep while reading them in public was a \"security risk.\" He would have some difficulty removing that doubt. The shifting of the burden of proof from the board to the accuse\" and the use of an investigatory tribunal rather than the more fami' liir technique (to English-speaking peoples) of an adversary trial made tn hearings even less satisfactory. For the accused, faced with the need to establish the truth in order to dispel any doubts of the members of the tribunal, could hardly establish the truth when he had access only t° those documents which had been selected by the counsel for the At In this case the AEC counsel, a one-time United States Attorney for tn District of Columbia, conducted the hearings as if he were the prosecute in an adversary trial.

The evidence from persons in a Position to have personal knowledge of this matter showed that this charge was not true, and the board rejected it. It is clear from the tes- \"riony that the real basis for these men's resentment against Oppen- e 'nier was air-force resentment of Project Vista and its sequels, specially at Oppenheimer's efforts to provide the American defense °rces with a full arsenal of diverse weapons, including tactical nuclear Weapons, so that the country would not be forced to rely solely or Mainly on strategic nuclear bombing to play its role in world politics. I his point was put very well by Professor Walter G. Whitman of \"H, who was a member of GAC from 1950—and had been chairman ot the Research and Development Board of the Department of Defense n I 95 I ~1953. He said: \"Dr. Oppenheimer was trying to point out the 'de variety of military uses of the bomb, the small bomb as well as he large bomb.

In my judgment, his advice and his arguments for a gamut . atomic weapons, extending even over to the use of the atomic weapon n air defense of the United States, has been more productive than any . n er one individual. You see, he had the opportunity to not only advise the Atomic Energy Commission, but advise in the military services of e department of Defense.

In studyi g these we have available the information of public-opinion polls, voti 5 records, and formal statements. From these records it is clear that pu > opinion alwavs supported large defense forces and did not objec higher taxes or government spending to sustain them.

These statements are based on file of public-opinion polls at the Public Opinion Research Center Williams College, as studied by Professor Samuel P. Huntington Harvard Universitv. This studv shows that public-opinion support stronger armed forces for the whole period 1945-1960 was usually the order of two to one, and reflected changes in international tensi to a surprisinglv limited degree.

On the contrary, the congressional Republican Party members, in both periods, were more concerned with what they called \"fiscal responsibility\" (meaning balanced budgets, reduced government spending, and reduced taxes) than it was with defense or world affairs. Thus the Democratic \"arty in Congress was much closer in behavior to public opinion than the Republican congressional party was. Professor Huntington has illuminated this difference by an analysis °f congressional voting records over the period 1945-1960. He has examined votes on 79 controversial defense issues in Congress over the '5-year period and found that a majority of Democrats voted pro-de- tense on 74 of the 79 issues, while a majority of Republicans voted pro-defense on only 39 of the 79 issues. On all these issues, Democratic Se nators voted 78.8 percent pro-defense and Republican senators voted y 43 percent pro-defense, while Democratic representatives voted 7<M percent pro-defense and Republican representatives voted 53.8 per- cent pro-defense. Moreover, the Republican votes in both Houses were ess pro-defense in the Eisenhower period than in the Truman period, \" e Senate Republican pro-defense votes falling from 47.1 to 33 percent Vlt n the change in Administration, and the House Republican pro-de- ense votes falling from 54.8 to 50.4 percent. Moreover, analysis of these °tes, on a sectional basis, shows that the Republican pro-defense votes \"'ere concentrated in the Northeast and on the Pacific Coast, while the emocratic pro-defense votes were spaced relatively evenly around the country. When we shift from the Congress to the Administration, we see that le Democratic Administration, while still pro-defense, was less so than eniocratic congressmen, but that the Republican Administration, while ot pro-defense, was somewhat more favorable to defense than Repub- lc an congressmen. *his situation can be explained in terms of three forces acting upon Po'iticians: (i) the need for votes, (2) the need for campaign contribu- °ns, and (3) awareness of world conditions. On the Democratic side, P blic opinion, which means votes, works from the people to congress- en , while awareness of world conditions works from outside upon the \"ministration and through it to Congress. The lobbying of special-in- fest groups and the need for campaign contributions is less significant an the other two forces, but do make the Administration somewhat less \" o-defense (because more pro-balanced budget) than Congress. ^n the Republican side the influence of special interests is much 6 eater simply because the Republican Party is the party of middle-class . ® business interests. In fact, the influence of lobbying by special erests is so great that it makes both the Republican Congress and the ^Publican Administration relatively immune to the need for defense,"},{"pageNumber":1015,"pageContent":"IOOO  TRAGEDY AND HOPE with the immunity less general in the Administration than in the Con- gress because the former is compelled, by its position, to pay some attention to world conditions. The Republican congressmen, on the other hand, are relatively immune both to public opinion and the press- ure of world conditions, being shielded from the former by the in- fluence of special-interest lobbyists and shielded from the latter by the Administration. The history of the Eisenhower Administration in defense and strategic matters is largely the story of how its sincere efforts to respond to Big Business demands for balanced budgets and tax reductions were fr us ' trated by the constant challenge of world conditions demanding an in- tensified defense effort. A significant element in this story is the efforts of the Administration to conceal these frustrations by the manipulation of public opinion by propaganda, especially by propaganda which trie to make it appear much more aggressive against Communism than i actually was. It really reversed Theodore Roosevelt's dictum into \"Spea K roughly and carry a small stick.\" The rough speaking was done oy Dulles; the small stick was the Republican defense effort; when the smallness of the stick made it necessary to suspend Dulles's bluster briefly, Eisenhower charmed the country, if not the world, with a ie w words of sweet reasonableness. The characteristics of the Eisenhower Administration were set imm e \" diately after the election. His hurried visit to Korea was little more tna a propaganda stunt, required by his campaign promise, and contribut little if anything to the eventual truce in Korea. En route home i had a conference with Dulles, Charles Wilson, General Bradley of )^ ' and Admiral Arthur W. Radford (Commander in Chief, Pacific) on the cruiser Helena at Wake Island. There, a month before inauguration. set the pattern of his Administration—fiscal conservatism: \"A prodig' outlay of borrowed money on military equipment could in the end, . generating inflation, disastrously weaken the economy and thus dei the purpose it was meant to serve.\" Subsequently this point of vl was often supported by a favorite quotation of the Radical Rig\" \"~ quotation attributed to Lenin, although he never said it, that capita i states could be destroyed by making them spend themselves bankmp • (The Radical Right had a great love for ambiguous Lenin quotation , another favorite was, \"For world communism the road to Pans through Peking and Calcutta.\") . was Another example of the tone of the Eisenhower Administration given on January 20, 1953. In his inaugural speech the new Presiu announced that he was unleashing Chiang Kai-shek against Red v\" Although \"unleashing\" was not the word used, this was the chief i nl r cation of the statement.

The validity of the latter's policy in the rea was fully supported over the next eight years, as Chinese threats to 0r mosa again and again required American support to protect Chiang n d, eventually in 1955, fear that Chiang might try to recover China by Precipitating a general war between China and the United States led the •senhower Administration to \"re-leash\" him, quietly, once again. This is very much the whole story of Dulles's foreign policy: even- Ua I quiet adoption of the Truman line under cover of loud verbal , nun ciations of it. The chief real change appeared in a slight reduction America's defense capabilities, especially in coping with local war by ea ns of conventional weapons, at a time when the Soviet Union's Pahuities for waging all types of wars were increasing. When Eisenhower came to office he found the budget already set by Iruman for Fiscal Year 1954 (FY 1954) at $78.6 billion, of which $46.3 ''ion was military. The latter item was a slight cut from military ^ '953 of over $50 billion. On .March 4, 1953, the NSC cut Eisen- ^Wer's new FY 1954 budget by $5.1 billion. When the Joint Chiefs ULS) protested that any cuts would seriously endanger national se- ?»%, they were ignored. The chief reduction was made in the air rce , from $16.8 to $11.7 billion—this at the very time when Dulles was aolishing \"massive retaliation.\" The Truman air-force target of 143 ln gs by 1956 was reduced to 120 wings. An Eisenhower supporter, roiral Arthur Radford, was made chairman of the reorganized JCS, d the defense changes were given the ambiguous name of the \"New °k.' The NSC was ordered to prepare a new strategic survey, which lr nately emerged as NSC 162. The pressure they were under may be o nered from the fact that Humphrey and Dodge wanted the FY 1954 ense expenditures cut to $36 billion. n the meantime, the new JCS, meeting on the secretary of the navy's .* Sequoia, in August, came up with its own suggestions: increased 'ance on SAC in retaliatory power, withdrawal of some American Ces from overseas positions, increased reliance upon local forces for al defense, with America's contribution restricted to sea and air . Ver \". a strengthened reserve pool at home, and improved continental defense. These views were incorporated in NSC 162 in October 9 $3, and accepted by the President on October 30th. The chief modifi- lon was abandonment of the hope that any significant future war u 'u be fought without nuclear weapons. Shortly afterward, military .Penditures were set on a \"long-haul\" basis at not over $34 billion for , '957 and subsequent years.

Each of the strategic B-52 bombers cost million, almost ten times the cost of the B-29's of 1945. Bases and co of skilled manpower rose proportionately, especially when the rise Soviet retaliatory power made necessary drastic dispersal of SAC Da and a great increase in the constant airborne alert. iMoreover, whate he cost, deliveries of B-52's were slow, only 41 by New Year's i°5 ' with a production rate of about one a week (with about 25 p erC rejected by the air force) after that. This compared with Soviet p duction of their equivalent planes, the \"Bison\" and the \"Bear\" (Ty\"95 of over five a week in 1956. The display of at least ten \"Bisons' m Red Square \"flyover\" on May Day 1955 was a considerable shock to \"New Look,\" but a year later Eisenhower was ready to take it in stn • \"It is vital that we get what we believe we need; that does not necessa mean more than somebody else.\" Five days later, he introduced a concept: \"Enough is certainly aplenty.\" The gradual obsolescence of the manned bomber and the use of nUC L. missiles, especially ICB.M's, raised the cost of nuclear retaliation. Minute Man ICBM, of which we needed hundreds, cost over a mi dollars each, with tens of millions more for manning and maintena ' while the nuclear submarine with its 16 Polaris missiles ran over * - million each. Moreover, all these strategic weapons were obsoles almost as soon as they were operational.   ^   The costs of conventional forces, armed as they must be with nue tactical weapons, also soar.

All services except the air force were cut, so that the total figure for Military manpower, at 3.7 million in December 1952, was almost 2.5 ^\"lion six years later. The army was cut by one-third, from 1,481,000 presenting 20 divisions to below a million in 14 divisions. In this way, ^ n }' expenditures were cut almost in half, from $16,242 million in FY '953 to $8,702 million in FY 1956. Protests against this by men like riTl y Chief of Staff General Matthew Ridgway were answered with (i e \"land assertion that these smaller forces had greater fighting power, a bigger bang for a buck.\" In 1955, however, when Eisenhower re- tried from the first, relatively successful, \"Summit Conference\" with Krushchev in Geneva, filled with determination to achieve his $33 \"'ion defense-expenditure level in FY 1956 instead of FY 1957 as orig- a \"y planned, even Dulles and Wilson objected.

At the end of the war, Stalin's rule in Russia was as firmly established as it had ever been. He was head of the government as well as leader the Communist Party, with the army completely subordinate to his *ul. The armv played only a small role in the domestic politics of the country, but Stalin had shown his power over it in the Great Purge of lQ 37 when he had destroyed at least 5,000 of its officers on falsified charges of disloyalty. The survivors were under close scrutiny both from ^ret police units established, for security reasons, throughout its organ- nation and from the party commissars attached to its major units. The ecr et police, under the Ministry of State Security, was a state within a ate , with its own armed forces, including armored divisions and com- P ctely autonomous air units. It controlled millions of prisoners and slave aborers, large industrial enterprises, and wide territories (chiefly in n °rthern Asia). Stalin was exempt from the authority of these secret P°uce and, at the same time, had his own secret police powers within e party organization, because the party statutes of 1934 (prepared by az ar Kaganovich) had given him an independent police apparatus for se within the party; this was controlled from his personal secretariat Unc <er Lieutenant General A. N. Poskrebyshev. I he party, like the police, had units (originally called \"cells\") in most every industrial enterprise, in many collective farms, in residential nei ghborhoods, and rose thence, in a hierarchy of cities, regions, prov- Ces , and nations, parallel to the governmental system. Stalin nullified possible opposition by encouraging division and rivalry °t only among the diverse hierarchies of power radiating downward 0rn his own position in government, in party, army, police, and ononiic life, but also within each hierarchy, by encouraging the am- 1Cl ous to seek to rise, step by step, through vacancies created by his H tiodic purges. These purges not only opened the way upward for • ° Un ger and more ruthless men, but served as justifications for Stalin's Sowing paranoia. Within the party the purges of 1924-1929 had eliminated, usually by e ath, most of the \"Old Bolsheviks\" (those who had been party mem- er s before the 1917 Revolution). In 1929-1934, using a new and younger 8 rou P, Stalin had killed 10,000,000 Russians (his own estimate) in the lv e to establish collective farms.

A party required three members as a minimum, and in 1950 a substantial action of the existing collective farms had no party cells at all, while ^ majority had cells of less than six members each. n two years, by merging collective farms, Khrushchev reduced the al \"umber of such units from 252,000 to 94,800, but 18,000 still had no \" ty cells, while only 5,000 had cells with over 25 members.

Stalin moved with his customary skill, steadily dispersing and diiu ing the authority of the Old Guard: the number of ministries was » creased, the Politburo ceased to meet, its ten members were dissol\\ into a large Presidium of thirty-six, and the Old Guard were shifted ir° operating ministries to posts without portfolios: Molotov from Fore g Affairs, Kaganovich from Heavy Industry, Nikolai Bulganin from ^ fense, Mikovan from Trade.

During the next five years, a struggle for power whose details are still concealed, Khrushchev rose 0r n the secretary's post to be supreme autocrat, eliminating in the Process all other possible claimants to power. The process by which he Uc ceeded Stalin was almost a repetition of that by which Stalin had suc- ee ded Lenin. In each case, the ultimately successful contender was the cast prominent of a group of contenders; in each case this victor used . e post of secretary of the party as the chief weapon in his upward rise; e ach case, this rise was achieved by a series of chess moves in which ^ e most powerful rival contenders were eliminated, one by one, in a er ies of shifts, beginning with the most dangerous (in one case Trotsky, n the later case Beria). And in both, this whole process was done under Pretense of \"collective leadership.\" Immediately after Stalin's death, the \"collective leadership\" was headed y a triumvirate of Malenkov, Beria, and Molotov.

Wild rumors, especially among the satellites, and some relaxation, Beria's behest, in East Germany gave rise to false hopes among the wOr* ers there. On June 16, 1953, these workers rose up against the Cornrn nist government in East Berlin. After a day of hesitation, these uprising were crushed with the full power of the Soviet occupation armored visions. Using this event as an excuse, the leaders in the Kremlin su denly arrested Beria and shot him with six of his aides (either imme ately or in December, depending on the version of these events). The overthrow of the master of terror was supported by the regu army, whose chief leaders were present in the next room, armed W smuggled machine guns, when the showdown between Beria and colleagues occurred in the Kremlin conference room. Beria apparen > suspected nothing, and set down his briefcase, in which he had a pis hidden. During the conference, while one leader distracted his attenti another removed the pistol from the briefcase. Beria was then told he w under arrest. He dived for his briefcase, found his pistol gone, and looke up into the muzzle of his own gun. He was at once turned over to army officers in the next room. These had already moved four divisio of their forces into Moscow to replace the usual secret police fore guarding the city. This use of the army to settle the personal strugg^ in the Kremlin is the chief factor which was different in Khrushchev rise to power from the earlier rise to power of Stalin in 1924-1929- *• can be little doubt that the introduction of this new factor was due Khrushchev and that his secret speech denouncing Stalin in Februa > 1956 was part of his payoff to the armed forces for their role in process.        (        The overthrow of Beria was followed bv an extensive curtailment the secret police and its powers. Most of the latter went to the Inten Ministry, while its forces were subjected to separate control, and system of secret courts was abolished.

The scheme, carried out 111 an atmosphere of heated discussion, was not supervised by Khrushchev. lts requirements in machinery and equipment were so great that it rep- resented a sharp restriction on Malenkov's shift of emphasis from heavy \"idustrv to consumer goods, while Khrushchev's refusal to supervise it Placed the responsibility for its success at Malenkov's door. At the same tinie, Malenkov's public advocacy of a \"thaw\" in Soviet-American rela- lons was equally weakened by the secret Soviet drive to perfect the H- bomb. While the undermining of Malenkov was thus in process in 1954, fwushchev began to undermine Molotov in the foreign field by organ- •Zing a series of spectacular foreign visits without the foreign secretary. n e of the first of these, in September 1954, took Bulganin, Khrushchev, W'koyan, and others to Peking to celebrate the fifth birthday of Red '-\"ina. During the visit Khrushchev apparently made a personal alliance 'ith Mao Tse-tung as well as a complicated commercial treaty which offered Soviet finance, equipment, and specialized skills for an all-out ln dustrializ ation of China (the so-called \"great leap forward\"). Ihese events made it possible for Khrushchev to organize a campaign gainst Malenkov during the winter of 1954-1955. Ostensibly this was ased on Malenkov's desire to relax the intense emphasis on heavy in- itialization, but, in fact, Malenkov's lack of aggressiveness in foreign Policy W as equally significant. In combination the two issues created Pressure which Malenkov could not resist. On February 8, 1955, his cognation was read to the Supreme Soviet. He assumed responsibility ° r the unsatisfactory state of Soviet agriculture, and relinquished the P°st of premier, although remaining on in the Central Committee in the exv post of minister of power stations. The new premier was Bulganin, \"o released his previous post of defense minister to his deputy, Marshal «iukov, hero of World War II. Ihese struggles within the Kremlin are based on persons, not on is- es , since the latter are used chiefly as weapons in the struggle. In the } from Malenkov to Bulganin, the critical issues were the chronic .Sicultural problem and the choice between Stalin's policy of relentless u strialization, regardless of the cost to peasants and workers, and a w policy of increased consumers' goods.

In this struggle Khrushchev found support in Bulganin, Mikovan, and probably Zhukov. The netf policy was established while Alolotov was still foreign minister through a series of elaborate state visits by Bulganin and Khrushchev (\"B a' ld K,\" as they were called) to foreign countries. The most significant ot these visits, because it marked a sharp reversal both of Stalin and ot Molotov, was a six-day visit to Tito in Yugoslavia in May 1955- ^\". lS acceptance of Titoism is of great importance because it showed Russia in an apologetic role for a major past error and because it reversed Stalin's rule that all Communist parties everywhere must follow t' ,e Kremlin's leadership.

The 1 95 5 Summit Conference at Geneva on July 18-24 was Anthony den's contribution to the \"thaw.\" Dulles participated most reluctantly, m there had been increasingly unfavorable comment on his inflexible att 'tude toward the Russians, and he felt compelled to yield to Eden's \"isistence in order to help Eden's Conservative Party in the British Gen- ra < Elections of May, 1955. Once these were successfully passed, the e eting had to be carried out, but Dulles had no hopes of its success. e contributed little in this direction himself when he insisted that dis- ^anient must be discussed before German reunion. Outsiders, trying 0 interpret the Russian attitude toward the \"thaw\" on the basis of no enable information, placed much greater hopes in the Summit Meeting an Dulles did, chiefly because of the surprising Soviet shift which had Produced the Austrian Peace Treaty of May 15, 1955, with its subse- quent evacuation of Austria by Russian troops. The Austrian treaty stored the country's frontiers of January 1938 and promised free navi- S.ion of the Danube, while prohibiting any union with Germany and mding Austria to neutrality. l he neutralization of Austria gave rise, in 1955, to a good deal of a gue talk about \"disengagement\" in Europe. The idea, however de- ne d, had considerable attraction in Europe, even for experienced diplo- ats like Eden. Nothing very definite could be agreed upon as making P disengagement,\" but everyone was eager for anything which would educe the threat of war, and the Germans especially had longing thoughts a neutralized and united country. France, which was deeply in- i ed at the time in Indochina and in the Muslim countries, particularly S er ia, was eager for any relaxation in Europe which would allow a bathing spell to devote to its colonial problems.

Eden's own contribution to these discussions was that a 0 \" militarized zone be established along the line of physical contact betwee East and West in Europe with international inspection of armed fo fC in Germany. Suddenly, on the fourth day of the conference, President Eisenhower made a speech which jolted the delegates, and even more the world, 0 of their casual attention. This was his \"open-skies\" plan, which neve came to anything but which gave the United States a propaganda a vantage the Soviet Union could not overcome. It had two parts: the tw super-Powers \"to give to each other a complete blueprint of our mih tar - establishments, from beginning to end, from one end of our countri to the other\"; and \"Next, to provide within our countries facilities to aerial photography to the other country.\" Nothing could be more repug nant to the ingrained Soviet love of secrecy except full inspection of t country on the ground, but nothing could more clearly show the w° r that the United States was as frank and honest as its President's own fa c ' neither had anything to hide.

Returned to Moscow from Geneva, Khrushchev abandoned his un- wonted quiet and resumed his stalking of Molotov. In September 1955, tn e harassed foreign minister had to make a public confession of error, Emitting that he did not know what point the Soviet Union had reached ln lts progress along the road to Socialism, In February 7 he had told the Supreme Soviet that the foundations of the Socialist society had been \" u \"t. It now appeared that the society itself was built. Such a mistake, re garded as picayune in the outside world, could inflict almost irreparable ania ge on a Soviet leader if publicly confessed, as this was. It was a cle ar indication to other such leaders that Molotov was on the way out. During all this, Khrushchev had held no office in the Soviet govern- ment, and had functioned only as partv leader, but what he did in that Ca pacity was of vital sismificance. Systematically he replaced party func- 'onaries on all levels, moving upward those he could depend on and ell niinating those he could not trust to support him personally. The other 1Va l leaders in the government knew what was going on, but ignored 1 1 since they made the one basic error which could not be remedied: e y believed that the government was the ruling structure in the Soviet lion, while Khrushchev, quietly at his work within the party struc- Ure . looked forward to the day on which he would demonstrate their e Tor. In February 1956, in what is unquestionably one of the most significant v ents in the history of Communism, Khrushchev lighted one of his lc ks of dynamite. The subsequent explosion is still echoing, and the Suiting wound to international Communism still bleeds freely. Khrushchev's preparation for a Party congress was as careful as Stalin's a a ev er been: it was to be a sounding board for coordinating party policy j speeches to his hand-picked subordinates. In July 1955 the congress was a 'led for February 14, 1956. At the same time, two Khrushchev agents er e added to the Presidium, Mikhail Suslov and Igor Kirichenko, and ree Khrushchev agents were added to the party- secretariat: Averky r 'stov, Ivan Belyaev, and Dmitri Shepilov.

It all began in a rather routine fashion. The first speech, of 50,000 words, delivered by Khrushchev over seven hours (one hour less than Malenkov's parallel speech in October 1952), was full of factual details- It was notable onlv for its frequent reference to the urgent need for co- existence with the West and its infrequent use of the name \"Stalin.\" The emphasis on co-existence was part of the campaign against Molotov, and, as is usual in Communist speeches, was filled with references, by volume and page, to the writings of Lenin. Most of these references proved, on examination, to be embedded in a context expounding the inevitable clash between Communism and Capitalism. The delegates, fully trained in such dialectic, had no difficulty in seeing the point: co- existence was merely a temporary tactic in the larger framework or inevitable struggle. Similar references were made to the possibility 01 peaceful, rather than revolutionary', change from capitalism to Socialist 11 in single countries. In this case, examples were given: the Baltic States, the East European satellites, and China! The reference to Lenin (Volum* XXXIII, pages 57-58) made perfectly clear that the \"peaceful road to \"Socialism\" could be followed only where a small capitalist state was overrun by a powerful Communist neighbor. The chief surprise of the general sessions of the party congress wa the speech from that old party chameleon, Anastas Mikoyan. It openl) criticized Stalin for his disregard of party democracy and his \"cult personality\" which insisted on personal adulation and on the consta rewriting of party records and Russian history so that Stalin would a ways appear as the infallible and clairvoyant leader. The real explosion came at a secret all-night session on July 24~ 2 ' from which all foreign delegates were excluded; those who listened we warned to take no notes or records. In a speech of 30,000 words RW shchev made a horrifying attack on Stalin as a bloodthirsty and demente tyrant who had destroyed tens of thousands of loyal party members 0 falsified evidence, or no evidence at all, merely to satisfy his own satiable thirst for power.

After this, Stalin for a long time actually did not direct the military operations and ceased to do anything whatever. • • • Therefore, the danger which hung over our Fatherland in the first p e \" riod of the war was largely due to the faulty methods of directing the nation and the party by Stalin himself. Later the nervousness and hysteria which Stalin showed, interfering with actual military operations, caused our army serious damage. He was very far from any understanding ot the real situation which was developing on the front. This was natural, for, in the whole war, he never visited any section of the front or an) liberated city. . . . When a very serious situation developed for our army in the Kharkov region in 1942, we decided to give up an operation seek- ing to encircle Kharkov to avoid fatal consequences if the operation continued. . . .

He elaborated the theory of the permanently Perating factors that decided the issue of wars. . . . Comrade Stalin's pnius enabled him to divine the enemy's plans and defeat them.

All those who interested themselves even a little in the national situ- >°n saw the difficult situation in agriculture, but Stalin never even no- 1Ce d it. Did we tell Stalin about this? Yes, we told him, but he did not ^Pport us. Why? Because Stalin never traveled anvwhere, did not meet . *v °r farm workers; he did not know the actual situation in the prov- c es. He knew the country and agriculture only from films. And these ftis had dressed up and beautified the existing situation in agriculture. lle y so pictured collective farm life that the tables were bending from e Weight of turkeys and geese.

Just as the German genera after 1945 wanted to blame their defeats on Hitler, so the Russian g e erals, with much greater justification, wanted to blame their early \" e ' ea on Stalin. But there undoubtedly must have been other causes of whicn we are not yet aware. The anti-Stalin speech, like the admission of error in the alienati from Tito, inevitably had an injurious influence on Communism throug out the world, especially in the satellite Powers, and ultimately beca the ideological basis for the splitting of these Powers into Stalinist a anti-Stalinist groupings led by Red China and the Soviet Union. Certain points about this speech are noteworthy. In the first place, the criticism of Stalin is directed at his actions subsequent to 1934; r are criticized, not because they were vile in themselves, but because 1 , were injurious to the party and to loyal party members. Through 0 this speech, as in everything else he did in this period, Khrushchev * working to strengthen the partv. Moreover, by directing his criticism Stalin personally, he exculpated himself and the other Bolshevik su vivors who were fully as guilty as Stalin was—guilty not merely becau they acquiesced in Stalin's atrocities from fear, as Khrushchev admit in the speech, but because they fully cooperated with him. . , A study of Khrushchev's own life shows that he supported Sta 1 ^ atrocities fullv at the time, often anticipated them, benefited persona , from them, and egged Stalin on to greater ones. In fact, even as K shchev in his speech condemned Stalin's acts which caused the deaths thousands in the party, he defended Stalin's acts which caused the dea of millions in the country. The fault was not merely with Stalin; it ^ witfa the system; and, even wider than that, it was with Russia- A system of human life which is based on autocracy and authority, Russian life has always been, will turn up sadistic monsters, as Russia throughout its history, again and again.

That is why it grows into paranoia as it did with Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great, Paul I, Stalin, an d others. During all the struggle for power within the Kremlin, foreign affairs * e re still actively pursued by the Soviet leaders. The chief event was a c hange in direction from Europe to Asia which took place in the spring '955- The Austrian treaty, the reconciliation with Tito, the stalemate ov er the German problem, the Warsaw Pact, and the \"Geneva spirit\" Were all parts of a plan to put Europe \"on ice\" in order to shift atten- |° n to Southeast Asia, to India, and to the Near East. This new direc- \"On was opened by beginning arms shipments to Colonel Gamal Nasser Egypt in the spring of 1955 and reached its peak in the so-called Suez ns is of October 1956. A similar effort in India, seeking to win its sup- port for the Soviet bloc, began with the state visit to India and Burma V Bulganin and Khrushchev in November 1955. This new direction and its consequences will be described in a moment, but it must be rec- °gnized that the continuing struggle for control within the Kremlin ^d the satellite states ran parallel with the growing crisis in the Near tas t and that both reached the critical stage at the same time in October '956. The struggle between the Stalinists and the anti-Stalinists within the atellite states and the discontent of the inhabitants with both groups kept Public affairs agitated along the whole zone of satellite areas from the a | t ic to the Balkans. Khrushchev's \"secret speech\" increased this agi- ation. Pressure on Khrushchev inside the Kremlin to reverse his pro- ess ed policy of de-Stalinization grew. Khrushchev struck back. On June ' x 95<5, the same day that Tito arrived for a state visit to Moscow, ^olotov was removed as foreign minister and replaced by Khrushchev's S e ^t, Shepilov, the editor of Pravda. But the satellite turmoil continued. ^his turmoil, which agitated eastern Europe for many years, may be re garded as a series of clashes between Stalinism and Titoism. Neither of ese is an extreme pole of dualistic opposition but rather two positions a number of scales, concerned rather with methods than with goals. th have as a goal the creation of powerful and prosperous Communist • ster ns, but they do not agree on methods, or rather on the relative mix- . re of methods to be used to reach their goal. Each sees industrializa- ° n as necessary to such a goal, but Tito is, perhaps necessarily, more illing to use foreign investment and foreign technical guidance, if these Ir ee from anv political control. Stalinism in general distrusts all foreign help as spying. Relying on . ^estic capital accumulation, and determined to raise it speedily, Stalin- *sni farms ipital accumulation, and determined to raise it spee puts severe pressures on the peasantry and thus emphasizes collective under political pressure, while Titoism is prepared to make much"},{"pageNumber":1039,"pageContent":"1024  TRAGEDY AND HOPE more use of private agriculture and of economic incentives for io° production. This entails a slower rate of industrialization and more effl- phasis on improved standards of living. There are also other, more pen' 2 ' sive, differences. Stalinism insists on uniformity and centra lized authority, while Titoism is more willing to allow diversity and collegia! contro • This, in their terms, is the distinction between a \"monolithic block\" an \"collective leadership\"; when the \"monolithic bloc\" is subject to criticisfl 1 ' it is called the \"cult of personality.\" In the satellites, for historical reasons, there are other sharp distinctions between Stalinism and Titoism. The former favors Russian dominatio . while the latter favors local nationalism. As a consequence, in 1945*\" I0 ' the former favored those local leaders who had spent the prewar and wa periods in exile in the Soviet Union, while the latter favored the unde ground fighters who had stayed at home in the Left-wing resistanc groups. And, finally, the Stalinists upheld their road to Socialism as t only road, while the Titoists contended there were many roads to cialism. As might be expected, political oppression and the rule 01 * monolithic party was associated with the one point of view, while greater readiness to allow diversity of outlook and coalition reg\" n marked the other.    _ . There is no doubt that Stalin intended to establish a fully Sta» nI system as just described in eastern Europe, \"the Zone,\" as Seton-Wats ^ calls it. But this could not be done immediately in the chaos of v ' a ending. Accordingly, a period of real coalition regimes was establish > based on the association of all groups and parties which had resi Nazism. Most of these groups were made up of peasants, workers, intellectuals led by a combination of exiles back from Russia and na ened resistance fighters. One of the chief acts of these coalition regime 1 most countries, was agrarian reform, that is, the division of former 5 estates into the hands of peasant owners. Within a few years, and in most cases by 1948, this coalition broken down and replaced by narrow Stalinist control, governed y typical Stalinist tyranny. This was achieved by getting the significant g ernment posts into the hands of hard-core Stalinists, usually the to Moscow exiles, and forcing other groups out of the coalition. t n process, the presence of Soviet troops was often the vital factor. A with this went a social, economic, and propagandist campaign to p the farmers by calling the more affluent, better educated, or rnor r f., e stinate ones \"agrarian reactionaries\" and \"enemies of the people, were liquidated, frequently by death. The chief index showing that stage had been reached was usually a reversal of the agricultural po .^ from agrarian reform to collectivization similar to that achieve Russia in 1930-1934.    , fare ,    As one consequence of this change, each satellite found its w especially in economics, subordinated to that of the Soviet Union."},{"pageNumber":1040,"pageContent":"NUCLEAR RIVALRY AND THE COLD WAR: IO5O-IO57 IO25 Wa s reflected in numerous economic and commercial agreements which set up conditions of commercial exchange and joint-owned public corpo- rations able to milk the satellite countries for Russia's benefit. Some of h 's was based on reparations. As examples of this exploitation, we might Mention that the joint corporations in East Germany drained from that area goods worth a billion Reichsmarks a year in terms of 1936 prices ' n the 1946-1948 period. The Soviet-Polish coal agreement of 1945 ound Poland to sell coal to Russia at one-tenth the price obtainable e 'se\\vhere. In all, it has been estimated that the Soviet Union extracted goods worth S20 billion out of eastern Europe in 1945-1946. oy 1952, eastern Europe, with the notable exception of Yugoslavia, was eing organized, as a colony of the Soviet Union, along Stalinist lines. The itter attacks on Tito arose from Tito's refusal to accept this and from the allenge which the existence of his different system offered to Stalin's on trol. Tito was able to resist because he was outside the zone of Soviet Jn'utary occupation and had built up a military and bureaucratic hierarchy °. v al to him, while inside that zone these hierarchies had been constructed nder Soviet guidance and were loyal to Stalin rather than to the local ^aders. The one exception, Albania, sided with Stalin because it feared u goslavia, just as Tito feared the Soviet Union, as a too powerful nei ghbor. ln 1951-1952 the incipient purge in the Soviet Union was extended to le satellites where its anti-Semitic overtones were even more evident. Rudolf Slansky, leader of the Czech Communist Party, was tried and Xe cuted in spite of his abject subservience to Stalin, while Anna Pauker as removed from her offices in Romania. This drove Tito closer to the Western camp and led Tito's friend Milovan Djilas to recognize that the Problem of Stalinism was not personal but institutional, caused by the ructure of the system, a disease fatal to any real social welfare; he a, 'ed this disease \"bureaucratic degeneration.\" When Djilas went further, the end of 1953, and recognized that the real issue was between free- 0r n and absolutism, a choice for all the Zone between the West and the ast , he broke with Tito because his criticism clearly applied to Tito's au thoritarian bureaucracy as well. Many persons in the satellites, even the • °Ung w ho had lifelong indoctrination in the authoritarian outlook, e ached similar conclusions and were like tinder to any anti-Soviet spark. The sparks were provided by Khrushchev, with his continued curtail- ment of the secret police, his acceptance of Titoism, and, above all, his s ecret speech.\" Few recognized that Khrushchev was basically an ultra- talinist himself, fully committed to foreign aggression, to ultraindustriali- atl °n, and to ru thless discipline of the working masses, especially the Peasants. His tactical shifts were taken as indicators of a moderate per- °nality, while, in fact, Khrushchev was as extreme as Stalin and more reckless. As part of the thaw in eastern Europe there was a considerable shift"},{"pageNumber":1041,"pageContent":"1026  TRAGEDY AND HOPE from Stalinism. Hundreds of thousands of political prisoners were eitne released or given reduced sentences, and party leaders who had tie purged were restored to the party. Some who had been executed w e posthumously rehabilitated. That key indicator, pressure to build up co lective farms, was reversed. In Hungary in a single year (May 1953 May 1954) the acreage under collective farming decreased one-tin 1 while the number of peasants on such farms fell 45 percent. This W fairly typical of the Zone as a whole. This general shift undoubtedly encouraged resistance to Soviet domin tion, a feeling which was greatly increased in 1956 by three other facto (1) the growing impoverishment of the Zone from Soviet exploitatio > from the poor crops and food shortages of 1956, and from the equa / grave fuel shortages (both coal and petroleum); (2) the shift of Sovi attention from Europe to Asia; (3) the unexpected reaction to \"secret speech.\" The consequences of these disturbing influences W general in the Zone, but the specific cases of Poland and Hungary no great interest, because they worked in such totally different ways. The chief difference, of course, was the great strength of the \"o leaders and people, going back to their terrible experiences at the hand both Russians and Germans and their memories of the extraordina feats of the underground resistance. Soviet reactions to Polish dema for liberalizing the regime were undoubtedly influenced by a relucta to meet that resistance again. However, the chief difference lay i n related fact that the leaders of the Polish Communist Party led the denia for liberalization and maintained a united front while doing so, while Hungary movement was resisted by the party leaders and could be sp by personal ambitions.    .    The crisis began in both countries in the last week of June 195 ' Stoppage of work at the Polish railway factory in Poznan grew into a ffl demonstration against the Communist regime.

Rokossovsky, defense minister of Poland since the days of Stalin, and w °uld make Gomulka party secretary. After a hurried meeting of the Soviet Presidium on October 18th, Soviet troops and naval contingents \" e gan to converge on Poland, and Khrushchev, Molotov, Kaganovich, an a Mikoyan burst into the Polish Central Committee session of October '9m just as it began. The presence of that rigid Stalinist Molotov, who Had been dismissed as foreign secretary in June, was significant of the P^carious decline of Khrushchev's position in the Kremlin. Khrushchev, however, acted as Soviet spokesman at the session in the e ' v edere Palace. He was violent and bellicose, calling Gomulka a traitor' and threatening dire consequences if the old Politburo, includ- ln g Rokossovsky, was not reinstated. Ochab, still Polish secretary, was \" rrr >, and ordered the immediate halt of Soviet troop advances, or all nego- •ations would be ended and the Poles would take the consequences. This \"leant resistance to the Russians bv the tough, well-armed Polish Security ^ or ps. Khrushchev stopped his troop movements, the Russians withdrew, and the session of the Polish Central Committee finished its work, electing a \"ew non-Soviet Politburo which excluded Rokossovsky and made gomulka secretary. The latter in the course of the discussions with *^ nr ushchev had indicated that his liberalization would extend only to oniestic affairs and would not injure Polish-Soviet \"friendship\" or the y arsaw Pact. In his speech to the committee, Gomulka sought to recon- \" e nationalist Communism with Polish-Soviet friendship, and made a ^'ere attack on the \"cult of personality\" with its hideous atrocities under e Stalinist regime. Rokossovsky resigned as defense minister and re- . rn ed to Russia with more than thirty other Soviet high military officers m November. Khrushchev publicly yielded in the Polish crisis on October 23rd when issued a statement that he saw no obstacles to relations between the two Untries from the committee's actions and that the Soviet troops would Withdrawn to their bases. On the same day, he was taking steps to ^sli the parallel crisis in Hungary. *he troubles in the Magyar state in the summer of 1956 took the same 11115 as in Poland, but instead of being directed bv the Communist r fty secretary, they were directed against him.

This simply intensified the"},{"pageNumber":1043,"pageContent":"1028  TRAGEDY AND HOPE agitations, which rose to a crescendo in September, chiefly from *n e meetings and resolutions of students, workers, and literary groups. Soi\" e of their demands were successful, including, on October 19th, abolrtH? of the compulsory study of the Russian language. On October 22nd a meeting of about 4,000 students discussing change in university life became diverted to political agitations and drew U P 'Sixteen Points\" which they tried to force Radio Budapest to broadcast- Omission of some of the points, demanding a new economic policy, rl1 withdrawal of Soviet troops, free elections, freedom of the press, an reform of the Communist Party, led to a mass demonstration on Octobe 23rd.

BY that time Soviet troops began to move from fifty miles away, an arrived in the capital by 2:00 A.M. on October 24th; Mikoyan had p e ' ceded them. It soon became clear that the Soviet tanks could not cofitr the situation, because they could be blocked by overturned streetcars other obstacles and could not subdue rioters in strong buildings: Mikoy dismissed Gero and put in, as party secretary, Janos Kadar, until then known opponent of the Stalinist group. By that time, October 25 th, revolt had spread through Hungary under the passive eyes of the J° S troops. On the following day, Nagy, still in touch with Mikoyan, ' oin \\ a new government and negotiated a cease-fire. The Russian forces w 1 drew from Budapest, and negotiations were opened between their ornc and the Nagy government for their withdrawal from the country. By .'. fficii olice time the whole Communist system in Hungary had collapsed; uno. elected groups had seized power throughout the country; the secret p and the party had disintegrated; a revolutionary council had taken c trol of the Hungarian Army, and Colonel Pal Maleter, a leader or revolt, had been made a major general and minister of defense. Most g nificant of all, the one-party system had been ended, and members or revived non-Communist parties had joined the Cabinet. On Oct 31st the official Soviet news agency, Tass, announced that the Kre was ready to recognize the new government and negotiate withdra of all Soviet troops from the country.   ,   However, as October ended, large Soviet forces had begun to tn Hungary, crossing into the country on numerous temporary con »j bridges.

Most of trie resistance was overwhelmed that day- As it collapsed, the Nagy government and their families took refuge in the Yugoslav Wnbassy. The Yugoslavs, including Tito, were obviously confused by Kadar's change of sides, and accepted his promise of safe-conduct to their homes for Nagy and his associates. However, when these people left the security of the embassy on November 22 nd, they were seized by Soviet forces and deported to prisons outside Hungary. By that date the flight of refugees from Hungary was in flood, despite efforts bv the Kadar gov- ernment to prevent it. Many were killed as they tried to pass the frontiers, °ut thousands escaped to the West, where many of them were able to continue their studies in a new way of life. The costs of the uprising were catastrophic. On the Hungarian side there were about 2,800 killed, 13,000 bounded, and 4,000 buildings destroyed, but tens of thousands were ln exile or in hiding, the country was shattered, and lay, as a conquered country, under the armed forces of its oppressor. The unanticipated consequences of Khrushchev's de-Stalinization ef- °rts in eastern Europe were bound to injure Khrushchev in the Kremlin power struggle. Indeed, they brought him to the brink of final disaster early i n 1957. As usual, the shifts of power were indicated by changes in Personnel. Kaganovich, who had been removed from the government on •' Urie 5i 1956, was restored as minister of building materials on September 2 * n d; Shepilov, who had been Khrushchev's appointee as foreign minister n June, lost his other post as secretary to the Central Committee on ^\"ristmas Day 1956. Above all, on November 22nd, Molotov was made Minister of state control, a post which had budgetary functions in all P a rts of the state-controlled economy and could have been built up into a s tate power, in opposition to Khrushchev's party power, in the eco- nomic system. Moreover, de-Stalinization ceased after July 1956, and Ven Khrushchev found it necessary to praise the old ogre. On Decem- er 2 3rd Pravda denied that there had ever been any Stalinism in the Soviet Union. Eight days later, Khrushchev said, \"We can state with contrition nat we are all Stalinists in fact.\" On January 17, 1957, at the Chinese *- n »)assy in Moscow, he said, \"Stalinism, like Stalin himself, is inseparable ro \"i Communism. ... In the fight against the enemies of our class, talin defended the cause of Marxism-Leninism.\" *°r Khrushchev, as for all the Soviet leaders, the great issue was to P f event Titoism from spreading into the Soviet Union and, if possible, 0 curtail its spread among the satellites. Every effort was made to prevent , n °wledge of the \"Polish October\" and the Hungarian revolt from reach- n S the Soviet people, and the attacks on Tito and Yugoslavia were re- rcied. Tito struck back on November 1 ith with the charge that Stalin a u taken the domestic and foreign policies of the Soviet Union to dead"},{"pageNumber":1045,"pageContent":"1030  TRAGEDY AND HOPE ends and that his errors were not personal ones but intrinsic in the Sovie system of monolithic authoritarianism. He was refuted in Pravda, a we e later. The Hungarian invasion destroyed much of the appeal of Communism to the Leftists of Western Europe and the world; this had already t> een left in shreds by the \"secret speech.\" Even in the Soviet Union, university students and intellectuals disapproved of the Soviet invasion of Hunga r . • Many literary works written during the de-Stalinization phase in £ spring were published the following winter, when the tide had turne again. Khrushchev struck hard at these groups and continued to do s for several years, with the result that the alienation of Russian in«\" lectuals from Khrushchev became established. This was reflected in c expulsion from the universities later in 1956 of hundreds of students Wfl refused to applaud the Soviet attack on Hungary. The official Sovie line was that most disturbances of this kind arose from the activities foreign agitators of capitalist aggressors. Simultaneously with the Soviet political and intellectual reaction :i tte June 1956, came a series of efforts to alienate the economic stringency wages were raised, taxes reduced on the poorest payers, social benen were extended, and the labor unions were urged to protect them; nuifl e ous projects in heavy industry under the Five-Year Plan were slowed up and their resources diverted to consumer goods. Most significant of a ' there was a sharp increase in the influence of state officials and a corre sponding decrease in that of party officials.   ,   This reversal was fully evident in the Central Committee session ° late December 1956, but the following meeting, in February J 957' showed Khrushchev in an aggressive counterattack. This took the form of suggestions for a drastic reorganization of Soviet economic lif e ward a more decentralized system. Undoubtedly this plan had consws able merit, but in Khrushchev's eyes it had an additional advantage, SJD it would remove much of economic life from the influence of the cent state ministries and leave it open to increased influence from local pa* J groups. He proposed the division of the Soviet Union into several do z economic regions, each under an economic council, or sovnarkhozy, diverse groups, and the devolution to these groups of the econom functions of the majority of the economic ministries in Moscow.

Moreover, each economic ministry, because of the constant shortages of resources, materials, and labor, sought to build up, Within itself, its own sources of supplv and also had a constant urge to hoard equipment and parts, even when they were not needed by it and vv ere urgently needed bv enterprises of a different ministry in the next street or district. This hampered expansion and also resulted in very ex- pensive cross-hauling of the freight of one ministry from remote areas at the very time that a different ministrv might be hauling similar re- sources in the opposite direction. The serious overworking of the Soviet railway system, a constant weakness in the economy, was intensified by such needless hauling. I\" spite of its merits, the anti-K group in the Presidium was unwill- m g to adopt this reform because it would drasticallv weaken centralized state control and strengthen localized party control in the Soviet economy. the state hierarchy of Soviets had fallen into decay, partly because of Stalin's use of the party and secret police, partly as a means to avoid Use of the fraudulently democratic Soviet constitution and of its federalist features. As a consequence, the state hierarchy lacked effective 0r flexible control down through its levels, while the party hierarchy had hese well developed. Much of the state's power locally was exercised \"tough the economic ministries, which Khrushchev now wished to a °olish. And because of his control of the party and through it of the Party press, headed by Pravda, Khrushchev could keep up a steady drum of propaganda for his economic reorganization. Everv local figure was for ' and it appeared to other rival leaders as an antistate move. Khrushchev, ^ the other hand, could make the opposition seem \"antiparty,\" with all e treasonable overtones Stalin had given to that expression. the economic reorganization law was passed on May 10, 1957, °hshing twenty-five economic ministries (retaining nineteen) and evolving their functions to twenty-nine regional sovnarkhozy; the State c °noniic Commission (GEK) was also abolished, leaving, as the only entral economic control, the State Committee for Long-Term Planning der Yosif Kuzmin (a Khrushchev partv official), who simultaneouslv ec anie first deputy prime minister of trie Soviet Union.

Khrushchev refused to accept the result, denying that the Presidium had authority to remove a first secretary and appealing to the Central Committee. The members of this larger group joined in the discussion as thev arrived, while Khrushchev's supporters sought to delay a final vote until his men could come in from their party posts in the provinces. Marshal Zhukov provided armv planes to bring in the more distant ana more reliable ones. The discussion became bitter, especially when Zhukov threatened to produce documentary evidence that Malenkov, Molotov, and Kaganovich had been deeply involved in the bloody purges of '937' Madame Furtseva, who was, like Zhukov, an alternate member of tne Presidium, filibustered with a speech of six hours. Surprisingly, Khru- shchev's agent Shepilov spoke against him, but M. A. Suslov, the h ea of the security police and the most cold-blooded killer left in * Soviet Union, shifted to Khrushchev's side. Eventually there were 3°9 members present, with 215 wanting the floor, over 60 actually maki g speeches. When the vote Mas finally taken, Khrushchev's loyal supporters in i party hierarchy voted for him solidly, and his removal, already vo by the Presidium, was reversed. Khrushchev at once counterattacked, moved and carried the expulsion from the Presidium of Malenkov, i\" 0 tov, Kaganovich, and Shepilov for \"antipartv activities.\" Then came election of a new Presidium, from which Pervukhim and Saburov, two strongest supporters of a centralized, state-controlled economy* * also removed.

Ori October 27th, while Zhukov ^' as in Albania, he was removed from the Ministry of Defense and, at to same time, was dropped from the Central Committee because of un- satisfactory cooperation with the party's political work in the army. The toxt few months saw a twofold advance of party influence, on a lesser Ca le into the army and on a greater scale, both directly and through the termediary of the revived trade unions, into the new regional economic councils. *he final cap of Khrushchev's rise to power came in the spring of 958. Following the elections and assembly of the new Supreme Soviet on '•larch 28th, Bulganin resigned as premier and was replaced by Khru- tohev. In the autumn, Bulganin, who had cooperated so well with the ew autocrat's rise to power, was expelled from the Presidium and con- e mned as an enemy of the party. This left Khrushchev as complete u 'er of the Soviet Union, head of both state and party, as Stalin had been, Ut resting his power more on the latter than on the former. *n the five years following Stalin's death, military strategy in the ^°viet Union underwent a major debate almost as confused as the ^ultaneous debate going on in the United States during Eisenhower's residency. On the whole, the range of theories of war, both strategic an d tactical, was much less in the Soviet Union than in the United States, n d changes have been much slower. But the basic issues were the same. The orthodox military ideas of the Russians, like everything else, had ee n stated by Stalin and were not allowed to change, under the impact new ideas or of new weapons, until after his death. Thus Stalin or- °doxy regarded war as a struggle between whole societies, each with its 'stinctive way of life, and judged that the outcome would be de- er mined by what was called the \"permanently operating factors.\" These actors emphasized the characteristics of the society, such as industrial rength, morale, level of training, and reserve forces. Other, \"accidental,\" ctors, such as weather, surprise, ability of individual commanders (even 1Va Poleon), or the outcome of single battles, were regarded as of little 'JNficance. Accordinglv, the Russians had no faith in lightning wars r strategic bombing or in new or, above all, \"absolute\" weapons. To e m, victory was achieved bv destruction of the enemy's armed forces y a series of blows and conflicts over a long time, during which the P e rrnanent factors, especially the forces of industrial strength and atl °na) morale, would be decisive. They regarded attacks on the"},{"pageNumber":1049,"pageContent":"I( >34  TRAGEDY AND HOPE enemy's population, cities, or industry as wasted effort, except where these could be directly linked to a battle. And each battle would be determined by a balance of forces from all branches of the defense services pe f ' sistently concentrating on the enemy forces over extensive time and space. In this outlook there was no place for the nuclear bomb, for strategic air attack, or for twenty-four-hour wars, and, accordingly, the American possession of the A-bomb was largely ignored. Protests against its use, and the desire to outlaw it, were undoubtedly based on the fact that it W» s an American monopoly, but the Russian objection to city-bombing or to strategic terror of the V-2 kind as ineffective and a waste of resources «# undoubtedly sincere. Soviet efforts to get the A-bomb and the H-bomb and to build up a fleet of TU-4's were partly a desire to possess what the enemy had, partly based on a desire to deter our use of SAC against Russia, and partly derived from Stalin's astonishment at the damage our strategic bombers had inflicted on Berlin. But none of these had much influence on Soviet military thinking. A change in strategic thinking arose in 1954 as a consequence of a debate among Soviet military leaders over the role of surprise in military victory. The possibility of a sudden American nuclear attack on Russia from the air had to be examined. As a consequence of this dispute, the role of surprise was considerably increased, although there was no general feeling that it could be decisive or even that wars might be shortened as a result of nuclear weapons. To this day the Soviet leaders still believe that victory will go to their country after a long war of i« asS forces using a balance of all arms and weapons. But they now include in this balance of weapons nuclear arms at all stages and ranges. However, they do not believe, as many Americans do, that strategic bombing can be decisive. It is simply an additional arm added on to the older arsenal, and will be used in war against military objectives primarily because wars are fought with the military sectors of a society. As a consequence of these views, the Soviet Union has no idea of being able to achieve military victory over the United States, simplyj because they have no method'of occupying the territory of the United States at any stage in a war. They hope to defeat the United States as a society by nonviolent means: propaganda, subversion, economic collap^- and diplomatic isolation. If the rivalry with the United States comes to the violent stage, they have every hope that the Soviet Union itself *»» not be directly involved, but can wear the United States down by fighting through third parties, as in Korea.

Thus they are unlikely to use nuclear weapons first, although fully prepared to resort to them once they are used by an enemy. One confusing consequence of the Soviet discussion of the role of Su rprise in war was an effort to distinguish between \"preventive\" and preemptive\" war. Because the generals, planners, and staff theorists were convinced that the W est must be aggressive because of the \"contradic- Hons\" of the capitalist economic system, they were convinced that they ^ere in danger of a surprise attack by SAC. Their weakness in this as peet of war made it unlikely that their retaliatory strike would be of \"ecisive significance, so they developed a theory of preemptive strike; nis said that they would countersurprise our surprise attack by beating u s to the punch with a nuclear attack of their own. Such a \"preemptive ri Ke\" would be justified only on the basis of conclusive evidence that ' e were about to launch a surprise attack, since our retaliatory strike te r their preemptive strike would still be very damaging to them. The Problem arises, however, as to how thev can ever be sure that we are ou t to attack them, and, failing that, how does such a \"preemptive\" . ar differ from a \"preventive\" war, which the Soviet abjures because it ls unnecessary to them? soviet military thinkers have been very reluctant to accept any theories nuclear deterrence or of limited war under an umbrella of nuclear er rence. Since war is a struggle to the death by antipathetical societies, c n societies will, in war, use any weapons they have. Accordingly, the Vle t Union believes that any general war involving the United States « themselves would be a nuclear war in which their ground forces, tactical air support and nuclear weapons of all sizes and ranges, uiq fight its way overland, against nuclear armed enemies, to occupy °5 of Europe and possibly Asia. e .V believe that there are three defenses against tactical nuclear th e aP ° nS: (l) dis P ersal of their own forces as widely as possible until ast moment before assault; (2) contact as rapidly and as closely as sole with the enemy in order to deter the enemy from use of nuclear pons which would also destroy its own forces; and (3) protection y as many of their troops as possible under cover, usually in tanks. an 1 St tWO °^ tnese P' ace great emphasis on rapid mobility of troops, t , ne third helps to provide this.

However, such a war, which would jeopardize the Communist way of life by threatening the Soviet Union, its only accurate embodiment, is regarded by the Soviet leaders as highly undesirable, and to be avoided at almost any cost, while they, in a period of almost endless Cold War, can seek to destroy \"capitalist society\" bv nonviolent means or by local violence of third parties. This theory of \"nibbling\" the capitalist won\" to death is combined with a tactic which would resist \"capitalist irn- perialism\" by encouraging \"anticolonialism.\" Such a change called fort' 1 ' on the part of the United States, a defensive tactic which shifted from Dulles's insistence that the \"uncommitted nations\" must join the W^* to the more moderate aim of keeping them from becoming Communist- This shift in aims, in reference to the \"uncommitted nations,\" occurre both in the Soviet Union and in the United States and is of major importance in creating the contemporary world.

The acceptance of diversity and of pluralism, >' the inevitable failure of both capitalism and Communism in the u ffer Fringe, has forced the West to accept and apply its own, often- \"irecognized, traditions. Moreover, the forcing of this recognition upon both the Soviet Union 3 id the West, in respect to the Buffer Fringe, may have the consequence, ln time, of forcing each of these to accept it in respect to their internal ysterns. Here again this would mark a great victory for the West, be- au se the acceptance of diversity and pluralism is part of the tradition \"i the \\V est and is not acceptable to Russia (whose traditions have al- Va ys been basically dualistic, seeing reality as a contrast between an unat- a mable ideal of perfection and a horrible, sinful morass of ordinary Uln g—the imperfections of the latter being acceptable as a necessary \"\"sequence or \" tnc unattainability of the former, with both extremes eing uniform and one). Such an acceptance will reduce the tension of e Cold War by allowing each polar super-Power to develop features * a mixed system which will make them approach each other in their aracteristics of organization, a development which is, of course, already FParent to any unbiased observer. * n e shift from dualism to pluralism and from uniformity to diversity 'as forced upon the Soviet Union in its most critical form by the rise Of *T\" • . Jitoism. This, of course, was chiefly evident in Europe, where condi- °ns of industrial development make it more reasonable for the Kremlin aders to expect the Soviet example to be followed slavishly by non- P'talist states. The same lesson should, however, have been learned, en earlier, in Asia, because there it became evident to many observers at most nations were neither able nor willing to follow either the Soviet n '°n or the United States. This observation, however, was impossible . \"er Stalin because his false theories of the nature of both capitalism and lm Periali sm made him regard the two as identical and thus to regard Gonial areas as being parts of the capitalist system. As a consequence of these intellectual errors, the Kremlin under allr t was prepared to see the fringes of Asia either continuing as colonial as or breaking away from European domination to become Communist nes > but it did not see the possibility of them becoming non-Communist noncolonial independent states. This meant that where Stalin inter- led in certain areas of Asia he intervened on behalf of the microscopic . ni munist parties and rebuffed the local native, nationalist, anticolonial- c groups.

For this reason much of the burden or su foreign aid was pushed onto the Soviet satellite states, especially ^zecn Slovakia. This shift in the Soviet attitude toward neutralism was helped . Dulles's refusal to accept the existence of neutralism. His rebuffs teiiu to drive those areas which wanted to be neutral into the arms of R° sS ,' because the new nations of the developing Buffer Fringe valued tn independence above all else. The Russian acceptance of neutralism l». be dated about 1954, while Dulles still felt strongly adverse to neutrals four or even five vears later. This gave the Soviet Union a chro logical advantage which served in some small degree to compensate its many disadvantages in the basic struggle to win the favor 01 neutrals. While these changes were occurring, the strategic debate in the SO Union continued. In this subject also, the fact that the Soviet uni was straining its economic resources was of great importance. 1 ne mands of the unsuccessful Soviet agricultural program made it necess' to put more and more manpower into agriculture at the very time the demands of the defense effort and the civilian economy (and trie < pant waste and inefficiency in the Soviet system) were increasing demands for manpower in industry. Moreover, the heavy casualties ^ the period 1928-1945 from purges and warfare had reduced the p°P ^ tion figures and the birthrate to such a degree that the Soviet P°P , tion figures, even in 1970, would be tens of millions below normal- only source from which such demands for manpower could be met in the conventionally armed units of the Soviet defense forces. As a consequence of these conditions, the Soviet defense strateg) bate from 1955 onward took a form somewhat parallel to that going 0 the United States; that is, some of the political leaders, including K shchev, began to force upon the Soviet military leaders a shift in enip from mass conventional forces toward greater reliance upon str ^A v bombers and missiles. Khrushchev's version of the Eisenhower ^ Look,\" in which the latter's \"Bigger bang for a buck\" was played Soviet version of \"More rubble for a ruble,\" was adopted by - Chief of Staff Marshal Sokolovsky and, less vigorously, by Defense 1 > ister Marshal Malinovsky.

The chief difference is that Soviet production and wealth is so m uch less than that of the United States that all such critical decisions 'Nust be made within much narrower parameters. In spite of these limitations of resources and demonstrations of inexperi- ei *ce and lack of competence parallel to that of the United States, the im- pact of the super-Powers was tremendous, especiaJly in eastern and south- ef n Asia and in the Near East. The Cold War in Eastern and Southern Asia, 1950-1957 THE FAR EAST 'n the Far East, as a consequence of the Yalta Conference, the Soviet g°vernment decided that the chief feature of its policy in the postwar Pcnod would be public collaboration with the Nationalist government of niang Kai-shek. This non-Communist area was to be held within limits / Soviet control, through local Communist groups, of various peripheral e as of which the chief would be Korea, Outer Mongolia, Sinkiang, pos- y Manchuria, and some portions of Southeast Asia. Soviet control of °rea was envisaged as a threat to Japan as much as a buffer on ^«ionalist China. ^ his Soviet attitude toward China was reflected in the Sino-Soviet ea ty of August 14, 1945, which obtained Chiang's consent to the con- J ons which had been made, on his behalf, bv Churchill and Roosc- ^ at Yalta. The most significant section of the agreement was in otov's note of the same day which promised that the Soviet Union's r * an< ^ n iaterial support \"be entirely given to the National government le central government of China\" and promised to end any Soviet PPort of the Chinese Communists in Sinkiang, since it \"has no inten- th' '\"terfering m tne internal affairs of China.\" As implementation of t - a g f eement, Stalin summoned the Chinese Communists to Moscow, them that \"the uprising in China had no prospects and that the Chinese sh , s snou ld seek a modus vivendi with Chiang Kai-shek, that they Q, . d join the Chiang government and dissolve their army.\" The stru. ese Communists agreed, but returned to China to continue their u- a a gainst the Nationalist government.

They fully expected him to remain the ruler of China, but they wished to hem him in so that he would find it difficult to cooperate with the United States in any anti-Soviet policy in eastern Asia. Accordingly, they not only expected the Communists to remain dominant in Sinkiang; they were also eager to see them take over an additional zone or buffer belt in northwestern China and in Manchuria. For this reason, the Soviet forces, in violation of the treaty of 1945, yielded parts of Manchuria to Communist rather than to Nationalist Chinese forces as they withdrew from that province- Stalin's real concern in the Far East was with Japan, which he feared might become an aggressive and militarized agent of the Unite States. He wished to participate in the military administration of Japan but was excluded by the imperious MacArthur. There can be little doubt that the Kremlin under Stalin was much more concerned wit getting a Communist Japan than a Communist China, and hoped to se the former reduced to economic and social chaos as a step on the way to a Communist Party victory there. All these hopes were frustrated. 1 h e growing prosperity of Japan, and especially the success of LadejinskV agrarian reforms, steadily reduced the influence of Communism, with the result that the Communist Party of Japan obtained less than 3 percent 0 the vote in the parliamentary elections of October 1952 and lost all of it twenty-two seats in the Diet. As protection against such an eventuality, Stalin insisted on the tow demilitarization of Japan, the breakup of the industrial complexes n' Mitsui, and possession or domination of surrounding areas such as sou Sakhalin Island, the Kuriles, and Korea.

The indigenous Peoples with their animistic religions have been subjected to cultural, re \"gious, and political intrusions of very diverse characteristics. The chief °' these intrusions have been those from India and China, a somewhat at er Muslim influence from the West, and finally, in recent centuries, \" e political and commercial influence of Europe and America. For gen- erations there has been persistent Chinese immigration from the north. % 1939 there was only one independent state in southeast Asia: Siam J Thailand), left as a buffer between the British areas of Burma and the 'lalay States to the west and French Indochina in the eastern portion of e Malay Peninsula. Southward of the peninsula, in a great sweep east- ard to New Guinea, were the multitudinous islands of Indonesia, ruled )' the Netherlands from Batavia on the island of Java. To the north of ese islands were the Philippines, still under American administration in 939- Between Java and the Philippines, the great mass of the island of °rneo had a fringe of British dependencies (Sarawak, Brunei, and North °rneo) along its northern coast, while, far to the east, the eastern half of \"nor was under Portuguese administration. Thus all Southeast Asia, exc ept Thailand, was under the colonial domination of five Western ^ in 1030. *he interest of these imperial Powers in Southeast Asia was chiefly . a tegic and economic. Strategically, these lands lay athwart the waters J ming the Pacific with the Indian Ocean, a situation symbolized by the 6 e at British naval base of Singapore, at the southern tip of the Malay n >nsula, between Sumatra and Borneo. Economically these areas pro- ce d substantial qualities of tin, rubber, petroleum, bauxite, and other \" °ducts. More significant, perhaps, from the Chinese point of view, a, \\v parts of the Malay Peninsula were fertile, were substantially under- P u 'ated, and exported great quantities of rice (especially from Burma). Western prestige in Aialaysia was irretrievably damaged by the Japanese \"quests of the Philippines, the Dutch Indies, and Malaya in 1942, so t the reestablishment of the colonial Powers after the Japanese col- Pse in i 0 ^- was ver y difficult, Burma and the Philippines were granted lr '\"dependence by Great Britain and the United States, respectively, n after the war's end.

But in February 1948, the new Cominform sponsored a Sou east Asia youth conference at Calcutta where armed resistance to colore ism was demanded. A Communist revolt in the Philippines had alrea } begun and was joined, in the course of 1948, by similar uprisings Burma, Indonesia, and Malaya. Most of these revolts took the form agrarian agitations and armed raids by Communist guerrilla j un & fighters.

Indochina brought considerable wealth to France, so that in the lat e 1930's the Banque de l'lndochine spawned in France an influential political group, who played a major role in the defeatism of 1940 and the subsequent collaboration. After the Japanese withdrawal in 1945, the \"aris government was reluctant to see this wealth, chiefly from the tin \"unes, fall into the hands of Japanese-sponsored native groups, and, by '949> decided to use force to recover the area. Opposed to the French effort was Ho Chi Minh, a member of the rcnch Communist Party since its founding in 1920, who had subse- quently studied in Moscow and had been leader of the anticolonial agi- atl ons of the Indochinese Communist Party since 1931. Ho had set up a coalition government under his Viet Minh Party and proclaimed inde- pendence for Vietnam (chiefly Tonkin and Annam) in 1945, while re nch troops, in a surprise coup, seized Saigon in the south. Unfor- Unately for Ho, he obtained no support from the Kremlin. The French orrimunist Party was at that time a major element in the French coali- 'on government, with its leader, Maurice Thorez, holding the office of Ice -premier. Stalin had no wish to jeopardize the Communist chances to ake over France by his support for a remote and minor Communist like 0 Chi Minh. In fact, Thorez signed the order for military action against 0 s Republic of Vietnam. At first Ho sought support from the United ates and from Chiang Kai-shek, but, after the establishment of Red ^ ln a in 1949, he turned to that new Communist state for help. Mao's o° v ernment was the first state to give Vietnam diplomatic recognition Uanuary 1950), and at once began to send military supplies and guidance Ho Chi Minh. Since the United States was granting extensive aid to r ance, the struggle in Vietnam thus became a struggle, through sur- £ at es, between the United States and Red China. In world opinion this ad e the United States a defender of European imperialism against Colonial native nationalism. u uring this turmoil, independent neutralist governments came into ' ls tence in the interior, with Laos to the north and Cambodia to the *h.

Roads were constructed w 'iere only local paths had existed before, and some effort was made t0 establish industries to provide work for a new urban class. All these projects required money, which was verv difficult to find ln a country of limited natural resources. The chief resource, oil, was le d up completely in the concession held by the Anglo-Persian Oil ^°nipany (later called Anglo-Iranian or AIOC), with the inevitable es ult that it became the target of the Iranian nationalist desire for ad- 'tioriai development funds. In this struggle the older elite of Iranian \" e , including the shah, the army, and the landlords would have been satisfied with a renegotiated deal with AIOC yielding additional funds 0 Iran, but the newer urban groups of professional and commercial n gin combined with the religious agitators to demand the complete er noval of foreign economic influence by nationalization of the petro- ,eu rn industry. J n this division within Iran, control of the situation gradually moved 0r >i the older elite to the newer nationalist groups for a variety of asons. The years of the world depression, the financial crisis, and the ^ c ond World War greatly intensified all the objectionable features of the AIOC system and, at the same time, seemed to show that no new gfeement with the company could remedy these objections. Such a e w agreement had been made in 1933, but the situation became worse fom the Iranian nationalist point of view). Accordingly, when the o v ernment in 1950 tried to obtain a new supplemental agreement, a tionalist feeling rose quickly against it and demanded complete na- n alization of the oil business instead. In June 1950, the shah put in as"},{"pageNumber":1071,"pageContent":"IO56  TRAGEDY AND HOPE prime minister his man, General All Razmara, formerly chief of tne General Staff, to force through the supplemental agreement.

Long and fruitless discussions between AIOC and the Iranian govern- ment, with constant interference by the British government led t0 stalemate. The company insisted that its status was based on a contrac- tual agreement which could not be modified without its consent, \\vni c the British government maintained that the agreement was a matter 0 international public law, like a treaty, which it had a right to enforce- The Iranian government declared that it had the right as a sovereig state to nationalize an Iranian corporation operating under its law ofl territory, subject only to adequate compensation and assumption or 1 contractual obligations. The Iranian nationalist arguments against the company were nume ous and detailed: 1. It had promised to train Iranians for all positions possible, instead had used these only in menial tasks, trained few natives, employed many foreigners. 2. It had reduced its payments to Iran, which were based on profits, by reducing the amount of its profits by bookkeeping t llC .

Thus in 1947, when profits were really £40.5 million, almost £'4-9 million went to British income tax, £11.5 million went to re- aves, over £7.1 million went to stockholders (of which £3.3 million to the British government), and only £JA million to Iran. If the pay- ment to Iran had been calculated before taxes and reserves, it would have been at least £6 million more that year. 5- Moreover, AIOC was exempt from Iranian customs tariffs on goods ne cessary to its operation brought into the country. Since it considered ev erything it brought in, whatever it was, to be necessary, it deprived •ran of about £6 million a vear by this. 6 - The company paid only a very small portion of the social costs of lts operations in Persia, drawing manv persons to arid and uninhabited Portions of the countrv and then providing very little of the costs of housing, education, or health. 7- The AIOC, as a member of the international petroleum cartel, re- Uc ed its oil production in Iran and thus reduced Iran's royalties. °- The AIOC continued to calculate its payments to Iran in gold at *.°-ios. per ounce for years after the world gold price had risen to £13 atl ounce, while the American corporation, Aramco, in Saudi Arabia raised lts gold price on demand. 9- The AIOC's monopoly on oil export from Iran prevented develop- ^nt of other Iranian oil fields in areas outside the AIOC concession.

However, it soon became evident that the Soviet Unio 1 while supporting Iran's position, was not going to interfere. The A nie ican position then became increasingly pro-British and anti-Mossadeg This was intensified by the shift in administration from Truman Eisenhower early in 1953, and by the pressures on the American govern- ment by the international petroleum cartel. At the same time, t American oil companies, which had briefly hoped that they might rep'ac AIOC in the Persian area, decided that their united front with AH-' in the world cartel was more valuable to them. This world oil cartel had developed from a tripartite agreem e signed on September 17, 1928 by Royal Dutch-Shell, Anglo-Iranian* and Standard Oil. The three signers were Sir Henri Deterding of S»e Sir John (later Lord) Cadman of AIOC, and Walter C. Teagle of Esso- These agreed to manage oil prices on the world market by charging agreed fixed price plus freight costs, and to store surplus oil which mig weaken the fixed price level. By 1949 the cartel had as members t seven greatest oil companies of the world (Anglo-Iranian, Royal Dutc Shell, Esso, Calso, Socony-Vacuum, Gulf, and Texaco). Excluding the United States domestic market, the Soviet Union, and Mexico, it c0 trolled 92 percent of the world's reserves of oil, 88 percent of the wor production, 77 percent of the world's refining capacity, and 70 pe rC of the world's tonnage in ocean tankers.   .

Back in office, iMossadegh obtained dicta- torial power for six months. He broke off diplomatic relations with the British, closed down nine British consular offices, deported various British economic and cultural groups, and dismissed both the Senate and the Iranian Supreme Court, which were beginning to question his actions. By that time (summer, 1953) almost irresistible forces were building U P against Mossadegh, since lack of Soviet interference gave the West full freedom of action. The British, the AIOC, the world petroleum cartel, the American government, and the older Iranian elite led by the shah combined to crush A4ossadegh. The chief effort came from the American supersecret intelligence agency (CIA) under the personal d'reetion of its director, Allen VV. Dulles, brother of the secretary of st ate. Dulles, as a former director of the Schroeder Bank in New York, ^as an old associate of Frank C. Tiarks, a partner in the Schroeder Bank ln London since 1902, and a director of the Bank of England in 1912- '945, as well as Lazard Brothers Bank, and the AIOC. It will be recalled that the Schroeder Bank in Cologne helped to arrange Hitler's accession 0 power as chancellor in January 1933. Managing Mossadegh's fall in August, 1953, was considerably easier, since he left his defense wide open by an attack on the prerogatives of ne Iranian Army, apparentlv in the belief that the army would be Prevented from moving against him by his influence over the mobs in n e streets of Tehran. But throughout the Near East, street mobs are asily roused and directed by those who are willing to pay, and Dulles a d the unlimited secret funds of the CIA. From these he gave $10 Million to Colonel H. Norman Schwartzkopf, former head of the New J rsey State Police, who was in charge of training the Imperial Iranian endarmerie, and this was judiciously applied in ways which changed e mobs' tune considerably from Julv to August 1953. The whole Peration was directed by Dulles himself from Switzerland where he as visited by Schwartzkopf, the American ambassador to Tehran, Loy enderson, and messengers from the shah in the second week of August ,0 53- Mossadegh purged the army of opposition elements without complete cc ess in the spring of 1953, going so far as to arrest the chief of staff March 1st. In July he sought to bypass the Assembly and demon- ate his irresistible popular support by having all his supporters resign om the jyiajlis (thus paralyzing its operations), and held a plebiscite in gust to approve his policies.

Two a»)J* later, anti-Mossadegh mobs, supported by the armv, defeated Moss** degh's supporters in Tehran, killing several hundred. Mossadegh was forced out of office and replaced by General Zahedi. The shah returned from Italv on August 22nd. The fall of Mossadegh ended the period of confusions which ha ensued since the forced abdication of Reza Shah in 1941. From i95j on, the shah and the armv, backed by the conservative elite, control^ the country and the docile Majlis. Two weeks after the shah's counter- coup, the United States gave Iran an emergency grant of $45 million- increased its annual economic aid pavment to $23 million, and began t pay $5 million a month in Mutual Security Funds. These payments reached a total of a quarter of a billion dollars over five years. In return Iran became a firm member of the Western bloc, joined the Baghda Pact (Central Treaty Organization) in 1955, and provided a close has for surreptitious actions (such as U-2 overflights) against the Sovi Union. The Communist-controlled Tudeh Party, the only political pa rt ) in Iran with the established doctrine and organized structure of suci partv in the Western sense, had been officially banned in 1949 but na supported Mossadegh from underground, where it was relentless, pursued after 1953. By i960 the shah felt his position sufficiently strong to try to pursue policy of his own, and began to shift his alignment from the older e group of landlords and army toward the more progressive groups urban middle-class professional peoples which had supported Mossadeg • The chief evidence of this was an effort to adopt, more or less as personal policy, a program of agrarian reform which sought to res each landlord's holdings to a single village, taking all excess lands o for government payments spread over ten years and granting the la to the peasants who worked them in return for payments spread . fifteen years. The shah's own estates were among the first to be di buted, but by the end of 1962 over five thousand other villages had been granted to their peasants.   „   In the meantime the oil dispute was settled by a compromise m tober 1954. The exploitation and marketing of Iran's oil was taken by a consortium of existing petroleum companies from the world c and some American \"independents,\" with a 40 percent interest he • AIOC itself.

Neither of these can be said of the great and continuing crisis experienced by the Arabic Near East in the twentieth century. The crisis of these countries was a crisis of the system itself, the collapse of Islamic civilization culmi- nating in the disappearance of the Ottoman Empire which ruled over it ln its later stages. The Near East today is the wreckage of that civili- ation, and as such presents problems far greater than the simple one of ^adequate natural resources. Rather, the problem is a triple one of resources, of creating a workable and viable social organization, and of dev eloping patterns of belief, outlook, and feelings which have some constructive value for human survival. In this colossal problem the influence of the Soviet Union, or of the Western Powers, or even of the Cold War conflict itself are relatively niinor matters which could be reduced to much less significance if the peoples of the area could get themselves organized, both externally and 'nternally, into some viable arrangement of living patterns. The same problem is being faced throughout the broad band of countries from ndonesia and Japan, across China and India, throughout Africa, to Latin •America; but almost nowhere is the problem more acute, and apparently ^ore hopeless, than in the Near East. This arises from the area's strategic lrn portance between Asia, Africa, and Europe, its nearness to the Soviet nion, its central position in the air routes and the water communica- '°ns of the world (symbolized by the Suez Canal), and its great signifi- a nce in the world's petroleum supplies.

At the moment we must concen- rat e on the two most acute and immediate problems of the area. These are Israel and Egypt. These two problems are working within a background of five signifi- cant factors. First is the continuing Soviet-American rivalry, which enefits no one in the Near East. Second is the sordid and grinding Poverty of Near Eastern life, a poverty made up, in almost equal parts, . poor natural resources (especially water shortages), wasteful and r ational social organization, and hopelessly uncooperative and spiteful Personality patterns.

The remaining 72 percent of a ndo\\vners with 13 percent of the land were too poor to exploit their Plots effectively since they could not afford fertilizer, choice seed, or ^equate tools, and in most cases had to supplement their work on the a nd by other activities or by renting plots from other owners. oince the great owners did not work their lands themselves, most S.Vptian soil was worked by renters and sharecroppers, often removed r om the real owner by a series of intermediaries and subleasers.

The pressure of population, the productivity of the land from mulop cropping (average annual yields about twice those in Europe), and m nopolized landownership drove land prices and rents upward just as tn , drove wages downward. This gave rise to a steady increase of renti » and sharecropping before 1952. By 1948 the cash rental of land per ac was about 30 percent higher than the average net income per acre. A the situation in the rural economy was explosive. These problems reached this critical level under the shield of t artificial prosperity of Egypt during the war. As the chief base for t • Allied war effort in the Near East and the center of the British resistan to Rommel's Afrika Korps, Allied supplies and money had poured m Egypt and provided wages and a higher standard of living for all. MoP over, high wartime prices for cotton had created a temporary boom- 1947 all this collapsed, and hundreds of thousands who had been sup ported by British spending during the war were wandering the a |le . of Cairo without money, work, or hope.   ,   In sharp contrast with the poverty of millions, about 400 famili es ha made immense fortunes from the land since 1850. In 1952, when 25 acres brought its owner an income of about $20,000 a year, the roV family had close to 200,000 acres, and the few hundred landlord farni\" held over a million acres. Little of these incomes was devoted to a ; constructive purpose, although few of their possessors lived such solute and wasteful existences as Farouk. These economic discontents were capped by political unrest. £g>r had been granted its independence by Great Britain in 1922, but latter continued to interfere in the governing of the country by peremp tory notes or even ultimatums (as in 1924 and 1938). Submission by monarchy or the government to such pressure roused great animosity the Assembly, which was generally dominated by the irresponsible n tionalist party, the Wafd (led successively by Saad Zaghlul and Musta • Nahas). Relations with Britain were finally regulated by a treaty m i°3 which established a twenty-year alliance, granted Britain continued p session of the naval base at Alexandria until 1944, and allowed it to ke r a force of 10,000 men in the Canal Zone.

Most significant of all, Mustafa Nahas's decree of 1936 establishing the Military Academy to train officers for f he new army opened this career to any Egyptian, independent of class or economic status. This created the opening by which ambitious and relatively poor young men could work their way upward in power and health. It was the first essential step toward the Nasser government of we 1960's and, for the first time in thousands of years, made it possible for Egypt to be ruled by Egyptians (the Muhammad Ali dynasty of i8ii_,pj 2 was of Albanian origin). The first class of the Military Acad- e my to graduate after the Treaty of 1936 was the class of 1938, whose Members, led bv Nasser, made the revolution of 1952. Most of the lead- ers of that revolt were either the sons or grandsons of poor peasants. Jhe chief aims of their revolt were agrarian reform, elimination of waste, ln efficiency, and corruption from the Egyptian government, and the c ompletion of independence by the withdrawal of British influence from ^e Canal Zone and, if possible, the Sudan. The revolt moved forward under the impetus of increasing shame and \"atred for the Farouk monarchy. In this process two chief steps were the British ultimatum of 1942 and the defeat by Israel in 1948, since these °Pened an unbridgeable gap between the dynasty and the officers' group. The conspiracies of the class of 1938 began almost immediately upon . eir graduation from the Military Academy, when Gamal Abdel Nasser ]°med a group which exchanged secret oaths to reform Egypt by ex- pelling the British. By 1939 most of this group were in contact with the Muslim Brotherhood,\" a secret band of fanatics founded in 1929 to es- ablish (by assassination and violence, if necessary) a political regime °Unded on purely Muslim principles. Many of both groups were in- °lved in the anti-British and pro-Nazi agitations throughout the Near ast of 1938-1942. These centered around the fanatical Mufti of Jeru- ale m and culminated in the pro-Nazi revolt of Rashid Ali al-Kilani in aa .i during Hitler's conquest of Crete in April 1941.

Like most revolts, that of 1952 started from an event which had little to do with the conspirators' plans. In October 1951, Mustafa Nahas, who had signed the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, enacted a law to abrogate it. Shortly afterward, guerrilla attacks on the British military installations in the Canal Zone drove the British forces to seek to disarm the Egyptian police nearby. In the resulting fight about fifty Egypti anS were killed and a hundred wounded. The next day (January 26, iQ5 2 ' riots in Cairo burned down about four hundred buildings, including the famous Shepheard's Hotel, the center of British tourist life in EgyP 1, Damage ran to over $60 million, but the real destruction was to the Egyptian political system. Police and army both refused to fire upon the incendiaries of January 26th.

But no successor could be found capable of winning the con- fidence of the diverse groups who sought to exploit the miseries 0 Egypt.

He con- ln ued to regard himself as a man of the people, but his insatiable thirst Wa s for personal power. The Agrarian Law of September 1952 determined much of the sub- ec pJent political and economic policy of the regime. It sought to allevi- ate the plight of the peasant and to force the landlord group, the center ° Egyptian wealth, to shift their holdings from land to investment in dustry and commerce. This was expected to create jobs for the numer- Us unemployed of the cities and to increase the Egyptian sector in r ade, which was still largely in foreign hands. The original law set a aximum of landownership of 315 acres for each family, with 210 for fte head of the family and a quarter as much for each of the first two \"'Wren. Land beyond this amount had to be sold to the peasants who 'ere actually working it, at a price seventy times the annual land tax, ^ plots of 2 to 5 acres. If not sold thus in six weeks, the surplus was j^en by the state in return for thirty-year 3 percent bonds and was \" e n sold to the peasants on long-term payments by the state. Since the Plants' cultivation, whether as laborer, renter, or sharecropper, had Previously been strictly regulated by the owner, this regulatory function as i under the new law, taken over by cooperative societies which were fade compulsory in each district. These societies also act as purchasing, ^rketing, and training cooperatives. The law also enacted a reduction , tents for peasants who rented land. Several years later the maximum ^'t for landownership was reduced to 52.5 acres per person.

Moreover, few had sufficient con- ^eiice in the economic future of Egypt or the regime itself to put much their current incomes into such activities, especially as the Nasser °° v ernment took over many of the largest and most prosperous industrial n terprises.

It was clear from the beginning that the only remedy for the popu'a- tion explosion was additional land, and it was equally clear that tni could be achieved only if the waters of the Nile were spread widely an more effectively over the uncultivated periphery of the Nile Valley- * ° this purpose the Nasser government proposed a High Dam three m 1 south of Aswan between the First Cataract of the Nile and the Sudan frontier. The project was technically feasible but enormously expensive- and involved complex political problems. The proposed dam, three miles long and 120 yards high, would t> a up a reservoir of about 130 billion cubic meters of water, much of it l Sudan territory, and displacing 60,000 inhabitants as well as submergi 5 many archaeological treasures. The project, originally estimated to c° over a billion dollars, would increase Egypt's farm lands by about 3 percent, or two million acres, and, by equalizing the flow of the P* throughout the year, would steady the country's whole system of ag cultural production. If the flow of water from the reservoir were nessed to generate electricity, it could yield 10,000 million kilowatt-hour but this would drive the total cost up to about $4 billion over fifte years. Such a project could not possibly be financed by Egypt ltse ' and could not be built without previous agreement with the Sudan. ->u an agreement must modify an earlier compromise of 1929 which gave Egypt 48,000 million cubic meters of water and the Sudan only 4>° million cubic meters out of the total Nile flow of 84,000 million cu meters, leaving 32,000 million cubic meters which previously flowed the sea to be divided from the new High Dam reservoir. From the beginning it should have been clear to Nasser that his reg' would be a success only if he found a solution to Egypt's econo plight and that the most substantial contribution to such a solu would come from the High Dam. Such a dam could be built only ^ the financial assistance of the West, since the Soviet bloc lacked the resources or the psychological outlook to do the job, and a dam 01 t size, seventeen times the mass of the pyramid of Cheops, could no built by Egypt's own resources soon enough to alleviate Egypt's ec omy.

When the United States rejected Nasser's tentative requests for heavy Ve apons, Nasser went to the Soviet bloc with his demands and obtained a ar ge part of his requests (far beyond his real needs) but on a barter Tangement which tied up the Egyptian cotton crop for years in the utu fe and removed this major prop ot Egypt's economy out of the ec °nomic picture. Without cotton to sell for foreign exchange, Nasser °uld not hope to ameliorate Egypt's immediate economic problems.

Of more permanent significance, the petroleum pipelines and pumping stations bringing oil to Levantine sea- ports across Syria were destroved, and a number of blockships sunk by Egypt in the Canal had cut off all Near Eastern oil supplies to western Europe by the direct routes. Most important of all, the parallel American- Soviet threats to France and England and the simultaneous Soviet attack °n Hungary had made permanent splits in the two great super-Power olocs and had given a greatly increased impetus to the growth of an ^dependent third bloc between them. This development of an increas- ln gly independent Buffer Fringe between the two disintegrating super- Power blocs became the outstanding feature of the next seven years of w °rld history under the awesome canopv of the Soviet-American missile and space race (1956-1963). Liquidation of the Suez crisis was not completed until the end of 1958, but in the interval the continued confusions of the whole Near East almost totally concealed the process of liquidation. Much of this confu- sion arose from inept handling by the Western Powers of the very real problems of the area. These problems were four in number: (1) the e conomic povertv of the area, especially the food crisis in Egypt; (2) the Israel issue; (3) the decline of British power leading to political instabil- ltv i and (4) the challenge to the French position in Muslim North Africa, especially in Algeria. The decline in British and French influence Was a consequence of World War II and especiallv of the decisions of ne British and French peoples to devote their wealth to social welfare rather than to efforts to retain their imperial positions. This left a power 'acuum, as the Arab states were obviously unable to maintain order in ne area or even to govern themselves, and neither the United States nor ne Soviet Union was willing to move into the almost insoluble problem °* maintaining political stability in the area or to allow the other super- , °\\ver to make the effort to do so. Britain made feeble efforts to retain s influence in Jordan, Iraq, southern Arabia, and the Persian Gulf. In ne case of Jordan and Iraq, at least, this was not worth the effort, and as doomed to failure, as became clear with the expulsion of Glubb Pasha m March 1956, and the overthrow of the Iraqi monarchv and of iNu n al Said in July 1958. American policy in the Near East was based on a series of assumptions 'nich. were so remote from the truth that no successful policv could be ased on them. These were: (1) that the Near East was an area in which e Soviet Union had plans for immediate penetration and subversion in tder to communize it; (2) that the Arab world was a unified bloc, with 'gmficant intrinsic power of its own, which would join the Soviet bloc J* 0r at least contribute to increase its strength) if not constantly placated y concessions; (3) that no policy of neutralism of the Near East was asible or acceptable to the West; (4) that the public opinion of the"},{"pageNumber":1095,"pageContent":"1080  TRAGEDY AND HOPE masses of Arab peoples was of some significance in the formulation ° policy in the Arab states; and (5) that the arming of the Arab states would contribute to their ability to resist Soviet penetration and to t» e political stability of the area. All five of these assumptions were untrue. The Soviet Union had no significant plans to communize, to subvert, or to penetrate the ^ ea East after 1948, and was eager to see it become a stable and neutral are 3 in order to deprive the United States of any excuse to intervene there- Moreover, the Arab states were neither united nor strong, but wer diverse, filled with mutual hatreds and petty jealousies, and almost total) incapable of acting as a bloc even when their primary interests w e threatened. In fact, their only common interests were hatred of Israe> desire to be independent and neutral, and the desire for economic han outs (without any accompanying political commitments) from an y° n , who would give them. The public opinion of the Arab peoples, describe in the previous sentence, was of little influence in the face of the co centration of local political power in the hands of the local armed forces, which were, with perhaps the exception of Nasser himself, corruptible, k forts to arm these forces against a nonexistent Soviet armed threat co tributed nothing to their ability to defend the area itself, and mere) increased their corruption, their economic burden on the people a the political instability of the area by increasing their abilities to threat each other or Israel.    ,    Dulles's policies in the Near East were consistently the opposite what thev should have been. No possible alliance or rearming of the Ara states could have contributed anything to the area's ability to resist Co munism, nor could the Arab states have contributed anything but h ea aches to the Kremlin if Washington's policies had \"driven them into u A on arms of Russia.\" Over-all defense of the area should have been baseo Ethiopia, Israel, and Turkey; the Arab states should have been g' v the independence, neutrality, and economic aid they wanted.

The real difficulty was Israel, which refused for several months to yield up the areas it had occupied without obtaining in return some solution of its grievances. These grievances were: (1) the refusal of the Arab states to make a peace treaty or to accept the ex- •stence of Israel by ending the 1948 war, (2) the Arab economic, social, j* n d political blockade of Israel, which included boycotts of all world business firms which did business with Israel, (3) the denial of the Suez ^anal to Israeli ships or identifiable Israeli goods since 1948, (4) constant harassment of Israeli shipping or fishing on the Gulf of Aqaba and the Jordan River, and (5) the use of the Gaza Strip, non-Egyptian territory occupied by Egypt under the 1948 armistice, as a basis for guerrilla raids °n Israel. Eventually American pressure and world public opinion acting through , n e United Nations forced Israel to give up the territory it had captured, deluding the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of Aqaba shores, without any Sl gnificant guarantees. A UN Emergency Force (UNEF) was sent to supervise the evacuation of Egyptian territory and the Gaza Strip, under Pressure of severe economic and financial threats of an unofficial nature r om Washington. The effectiveness of such threats rested on the fact hat the whole Israeli economy was dependent on the flow of private funds from the United States, while the British attack on Egypt had been abandoned verv largely as a consequence of the drain on British dollar an< I gold reserves, which fell S420 million in September-November 1956. The American threats of sanctions against its own friends and allies ov er Egypt at the very time when it was doing nothing to impose sanc- J ons for the Soviet attack on Hungary, and its refusal to cooperate with \" e Soviet Union in stabilizing the Near East because of Hungary, pre- e nted a strange picture of political fantasy as 1956 ended. One of the Methods of pressure used by the United States against the Western Pow- rs Was support of Egypt's refusal to allow any clearance of the Suez ari al until the withdrawal of troops from Egypt. This, of course, in- the shortage of Near Eastern fuel oil in Europe as winter deep- et *d.

In the nt erval the American position, ignoring all the real problems of the rea , was stated in the form of the so-called Eisenhower Doctrine in January 1957.

This promising Soviet offer, which might have been negotiated irtw some settlement of the Near East's real problems, was rebuffed by t(1 United States; instead, the Eisenhower Doctrine, in spite of the clear la c of any overt Communist threat, was used against Egypt and Syria in re- gard to Jordan and Lebanon. The Jordan monarchy was completely dependent upon the anii)' which was, in turn, completely dependent upon the financial subsi«> from Britain. This subsidy (amounting to £ 1 2 million a year) was ende by the new Parliament elected in October 1956. Syria and Saudi Arabia* which already had troops on Jordanian soil, joined with Egypt to coi tinue the subsidy. To escape from growing Egyptian and Soviet in\" ence, King Hussein dismissed his prime minister and sought aid rr° Washington. Rioting from opposition groups led to martial law, a ? million grant under the Eisenhower Doctrine, and movement of r American Sixth Fleet to the Levant to support Hussein (April '957'* The rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Egypt for influence in r other Arab countries was marked by an Egypt-Syria economic uru in September 1957, a $112 million loan to Syria from the Soviet bio and (in February 1958) the union of these two countries into a Unit Arab Republic.

Nevertheless, man survived, and, by 1963, was at the opening of a new era, based very largely on the relaxaton of the ^old War between the United States and the Soviet Union and on the °Pportunities to do something about the lagging social and intellectual Problems provided by the combination of political relaxation and eco- nomic prosperity. The decade as a whole fell into two parts, divided about 1956.

Closely related to this division based on weapons development was the somewhat delayed division of the decade into two parts by a change in ^merican strategic policy.

THE SHIFTING POWER BALANCE As we have seen, the whole period of 1953 to i960, in the area of de- fense, was dominated by the so-called \"New Look,\" the Republican effort to reduce the cost of the American defense effort by shifting f r0in \"containment\" to massive retaliation. This involved a reduction in in American defense budget from an average of $43 billion a year over tn last four Truman budgets (1949—1953) to an average of $37.4 a year oV e the six Eisenhower budgets of 1954-1960. In this process American no- tary manpower was reduced from 3.7 million men to 2.5 million over t six years January, 1953-January, 1959. Foreign economic aid was creasingly emphasized. In this fashion, the effort to deter Soviet aggression was based mo completely on the threat of American nuclear attack by SAC bombers 0 the Soviet homeland and less on American readiness to meet Sovi forces on the ground or to win third Powers to our side by economic other aid. Dulles, who saw the world in black-and-white terms, refused recognize the right of anyone to be neutral, and tried to force all sta to join the American side in the Cold War or be condemned to exteri darkness. Having thus divided the world into two blocs, he sought to set y between them a continuous circuit of paper barriers along the 1» frontiers of the Soviet bloc from the Baltic Sea, across Europe and Asi > to the Far East. The chief portions in the barrier were the North At- lantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Europe (1949), the Central Treaty Organization (1955) in the Near and Middle East (CENTR h and the South-East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) in the Far Eas^ (1954). In theory, the paper barrier was made continuous by the p r ence of Turkey in both NATO and CENTRO and of Pakistan in bot CENTRO and SEATO. Dulles cared little about the military strength, economic prosper 11 -}' or political democracy of the states forming this paper ring around Soviet bloc, since their chief function was to form a paper barrier that any movement outward by Russia or its satellites, by breaking paper, would trigger the trip-wire circuit that hurled America's nuC e retaliatory power on the Soviet homeland. In theory this strategic P oi / meant that any outward movement by the Soviet Union, or by one 0 satellite states, in some remote jungle or on some barren mountain y of central Asia, might lead to all-out nuclear war, initiated by the Uni States, which would totally destroy European civilization as we kno it.

This change, which took place over the period 1956-1962, is of major significance, since it meant that the Soviet Union and the United States became capable of striking directly at each other and did not have to involve third Powers in their disputes immediately. From the weapons P°int of view, it represented, on the American side, three changes: (1) ne shift in manned bombing planes from the long-range B-47's to the 'Utercontinental-range B-52's and B-58's; (2) the shift in missiles from tn e intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBM's), such as Thor or Jupiter, which had to be based in Turkey, Italy, or Britain in order to reach the Soviet Union, to intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM's), Su ch as the Minuteman or Atlas, which could hit the Soviet Union from inching sites in the United States; and (3) the advent, about i960, of the Uclear-propelled Polaris submarines, whose sixteen nuclear-armed mis- ses could strike the Soviet Union from submerged positions in the seas \"Ordering the Eurasian land mass. This American capability to strike the Soviet homeland from North ^erica was not achieved so quickly or so completely on the Russian side, even by the time the nuclear stalemate had been reached in 1963. ^ s a result, the Soviet Union could strike at the United States only by st nking at its bases or its allies in NATO or in the Far East. At first, in the Io 5o's, such a Soviet counterstrike would have been largely by the ^oviet ground forces invading westward across central Europe, but D y the late 1950's, as the Soviet strategic striking forces were strengthened y its acquisition of strategic bombing planes like the Tu-16 and of KBM's, this Soviet counterstrike to America's massive retaliation would nave resulted in the nuclear destruction and radioactive pollution of much °t Europe. The gradual shift of American retaliatory power from inter- mediate range to intercontinental range (in 1962) reduced the Soviet pressure on Europe bv reducing the importance of America's European oases. This had many significant implications for all the nations of Europe, °th Communist and Western. The key to the missile race rested on the fact that the United States an d the Soviet Union took opposite routes in their efforts to obtain n Uclear-armed rockets. One basic problem was how to combine the American A-bomb of 1945 with the German V-2 rocket. Since the •^-bomb was an egg-shaped object 5 feet wide and 10 feet long, which Sighed 9,000 pounds, and the V-2 could'carry a warhead of only ''7oo pounds 200 miles, the problem was not easy.

The result of t' lC race was that the Soviet Union in 1957-1962 had very large boosters which gave it a lead in the race to propel objects into space or into balliS\" tic orbits around the earth, but these were very expensive, could not be made in large numbers, and were very awkward to install or to move The United States, on the other hand, soon found it had bombs in all s lzeS down to small ones capable of being used as tactical weapons by troops ifl ground combat and able to be moved about on jeeps. As a consequence of the American decision to reduce the size of tn e bomb (a decision for which the great scientist Robert Oppenheimer va largely responsible), by the early 1960's the United States was produc- ing large numbers of warheads in a great variety of sizes, capable of being delivered by all kinds of vehicles from tactical rockets and cannons, up through Polaris missiles, airplanes of all sizes, and rockets of all rang cs ' up to city-destroying bombs carried by gigantic SAC bombers c ICBM's. Apparently the Soviet success in obtaining the A-bomb in 194 0 ' dropping an H-bomb in 1953, and in startling the world with its povve ful rocket boosters in 1957 not only alarmed the United States but as lulled the Kremlin itself into the mistaken idea that it was ahead of t United States in the development of missile nuclear weapons. This s called \"missile gap\" was a mistaken idea, for the vast expansion of •^ rne can production of nuclear materials begun in 1950, combined with simultaneous reduction in the sizes of nuclear warheads, by IQ59 * , bringing the United States into a condition of \"nuclear plenty\" ana \"overkill capacity\" that posed a grim problem for the Soviet UnioH' was, strangely enough, just at that time (end of 1957) that American studies (the Gaither Report and the Special Studies Project the Rockefeller Brothers Fund) suggested the existence of a missile g-r or inferiority in missile capacity of the United States compared to Soviet Union. This judgment, apparently based on overemphasis on _ size of Soviet rocket boosters, played a chief role in the American p r ( Khru- dential campaign of i960 and in the ebullient self-confidence or r%- shchev and his associates in 195 7-1961.

Suddenly, in 1961, the Soviet authorities recogn"},{"pageNumber":1106,"pageContent":"THE NEW ERA, I957-I964  IO9I  that they had fallen far behind the United States, both in number and m variety of nuclear weapons, because their existing nuclear bombs were too large for many purposes, especially for accurate and numerous long- range ICBM's. Accordingly, in October 1961, the Soviet Union broke the test moratorium of three years bv resuming nuclear testing, but, to con- ceal the purpose of the tests in seeking smaller bombs, they aimed their publicity on the tests at the fact that they exploded the largest bomb ever Usc d, a 58-megaton fusion thermonuclear monstrosity. After these tests, it soon became clear to the Soviet Union that the American lead in ICBM's could not be overcome by the Soviet Union, \"1 view of its limited industrial capacity and the other urgent demands 0,1 that capacity, in any period of time that had strategic meaning. Ac- cordingly, Moscow, probably at the instigation of the Red Army itself, decided to remedy its weakness in ICBM's by seeking to move some of its numerous ICBM's within range of the United States by secretly installing them in Castro's Cuba. This decision, if we have analyzed it correctly, showed once again the XVa y in which the Soviet defense strategy moved in a direction opposite to that which was influencing American defense decisions. Just at the Cl me (summer 1962) that the Soviet Union was deciding to remedy its Weakness in ICBM's by trying to install IRBM's in a third Power close to the United States, the latter was deciding that its supply of ICBM's Was increasing so rapidly that it would close down its IRBM bases in third countries close to the Soviet Union (such as Turkey). This American de- cision was already beginning to be carried out when the Cuban missile Cr 'sis broke in October 1962. The Cuban missile crisis was a turning point in Soviet-American rela- tlor is, similar in some ways to the Fashoda crisis of 1898 between France and England. It showed both sides that neither wanted a war and that their 'uterests were not antithetical on all points. Thus it signaled the sus- pension of the Cold War and of the all-out insane armaments race be- Ween them. It showed that the United States had missile superiority sufficient to veto any major Soviet aggression, while the Soviet Union nad sufficient missile power, in combination with the generally non- a ggressive American attitude, to discourage the United States from using lts missile superiority to make any aggression on the Soviet Union. Thus Va -s established a nuclear or power stalemate of nuclear vetoes between ne United States and the Soviet Union that secured each against the oth cr .

This meant \"at third states could undertake actions which their own power could ot in itself justify or enforce.

Thus Indonesia could attack Malaya; China could attack India; Pakistan, although allied to the United States, could be cozy with Red China; Cyprus could defy Turkey; Egypt could attack Yemen; France could defy the United States; Romania could flirt with Peking; and Britain or Spain could trade with Castro's Cuba, without the Sup er ' powers feeling free to use their own real strengths to obtain what the) wanted, since most of these strengths were neutralized opposing eac other. One significant consequence of this situation was the almost total co - lapse of the system of international law that had been formulated in tn seventeenth century By the work of writers like Grotius. That system ° international law had regarded the state as the embodiment of sovereignty- an organization of political power on a territorial basis. The critefl< for the existence of such a sovereign state had been its ability to defen its boundaries against external aggression and to maintain law and pub order among its inhabitants inside those boundaries. By 1964, as a co - sequence of the power stalemate of the Cold War, dozens of \"states (such as the Congo) which could perform neither of these actions we recognized as states by the Superpowers and their allies, and achieve this recognition in international law by being admitted to the Unite Nations. This development culminated over fifty years of destruction 0 the old established distinctions of international law such as the dison tions between war and peace (destroyed by the Cold War, which w a neither), between belligerents and neutrals (destroyed by British eco- nomic warfare in World War I), or between civilians and combata (destroyed by submarine warfare and city bombing). Nuclear stalema in the Cold War context made it possible for political organizations wi almost none of the traditional characteristics of a state not only to recognized as states but to act in irresponsible ways and to survive ° economic subsidies won from one bloc by threatening to join (° merely to accept subsidies from) the other bloc. As a consequence of this situation, all the realities of international an a by 1964 had become covered with thick layers of law, theories, practice , and agreements that had no relationship to reality at all. Today, the p reS sure of the realities beneath that layer to break through it and emerg into the daylight where they can be generally recognized has reache critical point. As part of that process of increasing sanity (which recognition of reality always is), the future of disarmament became nio r hopeful than it had been in decades, although the chances of reaC , ^ any substantial disarmament agreements remain slight. This means t disarmament is more likely to appear in the form of nuclear disengag ment and tacit adoption of parallel actions than in the form of e x P u agreements or signed documents."},{"pageNumber":1108,"pageContent":"THE NEW ERA, I 957-I 964  1093  The amount of myth and false theories that must be pushed aside to permit even the highest peaks of reality to emerge is very large. In the United Nations alone, it involves such points as the recognition of the Congo as a \"state,\" the belief that Taiwan is a Great Power worthy of °ne of the four permanent, veto-wielding seats on the Security Council, 0r the pretense that Red China, in spite of its possesssion of all the tra- ditional attributes of statehood, does not exist. Part of this return to reality is embodied in the growing recognition that there are more situations in which the United States and the Soviet Union have parallel interests than there are in which their interests are a ntithetical. Certainly they have a common interest in avoiding nuclear XVa r, in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to additional states, in n °t poisoning the atmosphere with radioactive fallout from nuclear testing, \"i slowing up weapons development, technological rivalry, and the space rac 'e in order to direct more resources to domestic problems of poverty, s °cial disorganization, and education; or in refraining from outbidding e ach other in grants of arms and aid to unreliable, ungrateful, unstable, and 'nefficient neutralist regimes. One first clear evidence of recognition of this common interest was the Peaceful settlement of the Cuban missile crisis, but the first formal agree- ment based on it was the official Test Ban Treaty of August 1963. This teaty not only aimed to maintain the stalemate between the two Super- powers to the degree that it might be jeopardized by their future testing; 11 also sought to hamper the spread of nuclear weapons to additional powers by this restriction. Both Superpowers and many neutrals feared hat nuclear explosives would get into the control of Red China or other \"responsible hands. By the late 1960's, considerations such as these revealed that there Ver e considerable areas of common interests among the states of the ^orld covering all three groups of the so-called Free World, the Com- munist bloc, and the neutrals. The net result was the'almost total dis- a Ppearance of the world as seen by John Foster Dulles only a decade before. The two-power world of Dulles was being replaced by a multi- °loc world in which the two Superpowers, instead of being antithetical °n all points, were finding large areas in which their interests were closer to each other than they were to those of some of the other, newer blocs, specially that growing up around Red China. Moreover, as we shall see, ln some ways the aims, methods, and structures of the two Superpowers w ere converging on increasingly parallel courses. Most obviously re- pugnant to Dulles would have been the rise of neutralism, evident not [ ,n ly in the increasing numbers and independence of the neutral states, Ut in the disintegration of both the old Superpower blocs as these weak- ened and dissolved, and former members of these, such as France in the *^ e st and Romania in the East, adopted increasingly neutralist policies."},{"pageNumber":1109,"pageContent":"1094  TRAGEDY AND HOPE As one obvious consequence of this, the paper groupings and harriers Dulles had so painfully constructed in the 1950's were under liquidation 3 s one of the chief tasks of the 1960's.

THE DENOUEMENT OF THE COLD WAR, I 95 7- I 96 3 Two revealing events in the late summer of 1957 offer conflicting t&r dence on the nature of the Soviet system. On August 26th the Krem\" claimed its first successful test of an ICBM. A montli later it announce that the sixth Five-Year Plan had been scrapped and would be replace by a new Seven-Year Plan for 1959-1965. The meaning of this second announcement was difficult to evalua ' but it showed the regime's increasing difficulty in carrying out its gran ose economic projects, a difficulty that arose from the failures or Soviet agricultural system. The state and collective farms used such q ua tities of equipment and manpower, and gave such limited production return, that they became the chief limiting factor in the Soviet error to raise standards of living, to maintain the size and power of the deren forces, to win over third states by economic and technical assistan > and to lead the United States in the conquest of outer space. The outp of food from the small private plots of the Soviet peasantry, which W presumably worked only in their owners' spare time, produced f on * . five times the output per acre of the state and collective farms. was, of course, an indication of the success of private enterprise a- spur in the productive process, a fact which was specifically recogni by Khrushchev in a series of speeches early in 1964. But in 1957-1959 this meaning of the change in the Soviet econo plan was unrecognized, or at least disputable, and the world's atten became riveted instead on the Soviet success with its rocket boost From October 1957, over a period of five years, the Russians showee way in outer space to the United States.

But on December 6th a much publicized effort by we United States, in Project Vanguard, failed in its attempt to place a Sn iall sphere of 3% pounds into orbit. On the last day of January 1958, f he first American spacecraft, Explorer I, weighing 31 pounds, successfully Vv as shot into orbit around our earth, but it was followed by another failure of Vanguard and a failure of Explorer II in the next two months. »n the spring of 1958, our success with Explorer III (31 pounds) and Mother failure with Vanguard were followed by the successful Sputnik \"I (2,925 pounds). The two years 1958 and 1959 saw many American failures in space (20 in all) mingled with 16 successful efforts (mostly ! 959)- In January 1959, the Soviet government put Lunik I (3.245 pounds) in orbit around the sun five months after our first lunar probe 'lad failed. In September 1959, Lunik II hit the surface of the moon, and a n _'ontli later Lunik III passed around the moon, photographing its hidden s, ue. In i Q 6o and 1961 the United States launched numerous successful space vehicles that gathered valuable scientific information. One of these, ln January 1959, made the first broadcast from space, relaying messages tr orn American ground stations, but in x\\pril and August 1961 Soviet Ve 'iicles successfully sent the first human beings into space: Vostok I was ^covered after a single orbit, and Vostok II, after 18 successful trips ar ound the globe, was recovered the next day. These first space travelers, Major Yuri Gagarin and Major Gherman S. Titov, returned safely to Soviet soil, descending to earth in remarkable demonstrations of the Soviet success in controlling their space vehicles. The first American \"Stronauts, Captain Alan B.

In the Far East, the first year of Red China's Five-Year Plan, the so- called \"Great Leap Forward,\" began to collapse within six months of i e beginning. Apparently to cover this up, the Chinese government bega n to adopt a very aggressive attitude toward the Nationalist Chinese goveflj\" ment on Formosa (Taiwan), and prepared to mount an all-out assau on its forces on the Chinese territorial islands of Matsu and QueflW/' which were still under Chiang Kai-shek's control. The strong supp° r j Dulles gave to Chiang, including reinforcement by an American nava carrier task force, and his psychological readiness to go to \"the brink 0 war,\" spread down to all parts of the world.

As soon as the imperious general had be en inaugurated as the first President of the Fifth French Republic (January, 1959), he took steps to extricate France from some of the French commitments to NATO: The French Mediterranean fleet was removed from NATO control, the use of France as a base for nuclear w eapons, either from planes or missiles, was refused, and French partici- pation in a unified European air defense system was denied. In two-day talks in Paris, December 19-20, 1959, the two Presidents, Eisenhower and De Gaulle, went over the ground again and reached a stalemate: Eisenhower rejected De Gaulle's suggestion for a three-Power global policy directorate, and De Gaulle rejected Eisenhower's desire 0r an integrated air and naval defense system for Europe. While these positions were developing, a significant turning point in ^oviet-American relations appeared during Khrushchev's visit to the United States, September 15-17, 1959- The Kremlin leader was full of his Usual talk of the inevitable future victory of Socialism and the need for Peaceful co-existence until that time. He welcomed competition in eco- °niic or technological affairs, in athletic or cultural matters, but he ruled ut the need for war or the legitimacy of aggression by either side. At rst he refused to be impressed with the wealth and power of America, ^plying that it was not surprising to him and that the Soviet Union c ould do it better at some future date. But gradually a very important enange occurred. In spite of himself, he was impressed. He ceased to Pretend to himself that the things he saw were some special exhibits set Pi regardless of cost, to delude him. Gradually the incredible truth awned in his mind: many Americans actually lived like this, in what ne ordinary Russian would regard as unbelievable luxury. The real delation came when he visited farms in Iowa, saw the equipment and way life of these successful American farmers, and found out the eco- °mic statistics of American agriculture at its best. For years afterward c talked of these matters, and, as recently as April 1964, he told the Ull garians about it and advised them to emulate the American farmers.

The weakening of the Soviet position, which the Kremlin recogm ze in regard to missiles in 1961, also appeared to them in other fields, a was fully apparent to anyone who wished to look at the comparand prosperity of the two Superblocs. Nowhere did this comparison stand ou more clearly than in divided Germany, and nowhere could the Kreni accept it less readily. In the 1950's and early 1960's, the contrast between the (East) Germa Democratic Republic and the (West) German Federal Republic were between night and day. The West, with about 55 million persons, W booming, while the East, with less than 17 million, was grim and 0 pressed. The West German economic miracle was based, as we have sal > on low wages, hard work, and vigorous pursuit of profits by pn va enterprises little hampered by the government or labor unions. It wa ' in fact, the closest example of traditional nineteenth-century laissez tiO that the mid-twentieth century had to offer. The government, under influence of Minister of Economics (later Chancellor) Ludwig Erha r . operated in terms of what they called \"a socially conscious free mar economy\" (soziale Marktivirtschaft), but the play of free economic fo f Was to be found in lack of interference by the government and co petitive wage rates rather than in price competition among indus producers. The fluctuations of the business cycle were dampered down , the government's fiscal policy, and it was said that possible inequities the distribution of the national product could be remedied by a p gressive income tax mild enough not to interfere with incentives. ut 1 wise, taxes were drawn to encourage industry to plow its profits into the business rather than to raise wages. This policy and the natio tendencies of the German outlook favored production of capital S°°. over consumer goods and for the export market rather than for domes use. After 1945, labor unions, which had been closely associated v political activities and with agitations for drastic economic and socia forms before the Nazi regime enslaved them, sought to avoid politics a to concentrate on wages and work conditions (as do unions in the Um States); but these activities in Germany had traditionally been the c jrices cern of other agencies (such as works councils), and they could harm) much influenced by unions in a period of surplus labor and low p r such as prevailed in Germany in the 1950's."},{"pageNumber":1116,"pageContent":"THE NEW ERA, I957-I964  HOI  This surplus of labor in West Germany came from the influx of 13 \"union refugees into the area, chiefly from East Germany and Czecho- slovakia. Once the boom started, the demand for labor was so great that refugees continued to be welcomed, and at least two-thirds of a million non-German, unskilled workers were imported from Italy, Greece, Spain, a nd elsewhere in southern Europe. The docility and eagerness to work of these peoples kept wages low, profits high, and the boom going through the 1950's and into the 1960's. As late as i960 only 38,000 man-days of labor were lost by strikes and lockouts in West Germany, compared to a 'niost: half a million in the Netherlands, 3 million in the United Kingdom, a nd 19 million in the United States in that year. Some of the consequences of this system, besides the most obvious one or booming prosperity, were that the structure of monopolized industry ^vith great rewards for the upper classes, with lesser rewards and little s °cial mobility for workers, continued in the 1950's as it had been in Germany since its industrialization began. In 1958 eight great \"trusts\" st \"' controlled 75 percent of crude steel production, 80 percent of raw lr °n, 60 percent of rolled steel, and 36 percent of coal output. The number of millionaires (in marks) more than doubled in four years in the nuddle 1950's. Yet less than half of the eligible workers were in unions, u nion membership went up only 20 percent, while the working force tncreased 67 percent after 1949, and only an insignificant part (5 per- cent) of university students came from the working class compared to a rate five times as high in Great Britain. To the outside world, and to most Germans, especially East Germans, the inner nature and structure of the West German \"economic miracle\" * a s of little significance. What did matter was that the average West German had steady work at adequate wages and limitless hope for the nture. The 10 percent increase each year in the West German gross na- 'onal product was something that could not be denied or belittled. Among those who had no desire to ignore it or to belittle it, but, on \" e contrary, were eager to participate in it, were the East Germans. *ney continued to flee westward from poverty and despotism to plenty and freedom.

This pressure became worse on East Germany just after 1959, w \" en the attractions of West Germany became greater, and the endless de- mands on Soviet resources for missiles, space spectaculars, improve\" standards of living, and a disintegrating agricultural system were increas- ing. To fulfill these demands, East Germany scrapped its unfinished second Five-Year Plan in 1959 and switched to a Seven-Year Plan syfl\" chronized to the Soviet Union's new Seven-Year Plan for 1950- As part of that plan, came a forced collectivization of the half of Fas German agriculture that still remained in private hands. In three months, February-April i960, almost a million farmers were forced into less thai 20,000 collective farms by methods of violence and social pressure sin 11 \" lar to those Stalin had used thirty years earlier in Russia. And the con- sequences were, in an economic sense, very similar: agricultural produc- tion collapsed. Shortages of food were soon followed by other shortages' especially of coal. As might be imagined, the East German winters 0 1961-1963 became grim nightmares. The Seven-Year Plan of 1959 prove almost at once to be unfulfillable, and was replaced by a new and m° re modest one for 1964-1970. But the area's subordination to Russia was hardly eased at all. East Germany, like the rest of Moscow's European satellites, is ° r \" ganized into a unified system of industrial specialization and economic exploitation, the Comecon (Council of Mutual Economic Assistance), tn( j Soviet's version of a common market, set up in opposition to the Marsha Plan in 1949. As a consequence, 80 percent of East Germany's exports g to Communist countries, and it became the Soviet Union's largest cus- tomer, supplying 20 percent of its total imports. Generally, this exchang took the form of Russian raw materials exchanged for German industri goods, especially machinery, chemicals, optical products, and scienn instruments. But the failure of the whole system may be seen in the fa that East Germany, whose prewar industrial capacity was about as larg as West Germany's, by i960 was producing only one- fourth the industrial output of West Germany. The Communist solution to these difficulties was to increase t tyranny, but this simply forced more East Germans to flee westwar • To prevent this, and to prevent, if possible, Communist knowledge the great successes of the capitalist system to the west of them, the Fa German authorities on August 13, 1961, clamped down a rigid de< strip\" along the East German-West German frontier, and hastily y a wall along the line dividing East Berlin from West Berlin.

Since then the figure has fallen to 10,000 to 13,000 a year with about 8 to 10 percent made up of those who were supposed to be guard- ing it. *n contrast with this, the West German economic miracle that made «iat countrv the third largest importer and the second largest exporter ln the world, with freedom and prosperity, was more than Khrushchev could stand. West Berlin, which shared in the freedom and prosperity °r the West, in spite of the fact that it was surrounded by the grim penury of East Germany, was even more objectionable to Khrushchev, \"ecause it was a glaring exhibition of the success of the West and the failure of the East. As Khrushchev himself said, West Berlin was a bone stuck in my throat.\" There can be little doubt that Khrushchev's talk about \"peaceful co- existence\" and \"the inevitable triumph of Socialism by competition with- out War\" was sincere. He was convinced that the Soviet Union, as the sole earthly representative of a Communist regime, must be preserved at any c °st. He, with his associates, since the testing of the first successful Soviet ne rnionuclear explosion in August, 1953, have recognized that a thermo- nuclear war would destroy all civilized living, including the victor's. The Ke d Army at times, and Red China always, objected to this, with the ar gunient that enough would survive to permit reconstruction of a so- cialistic way of life, but Khrushchev was not persuaded. On this basis, he Sl ncerely wished to divert the Communist-capitalist struggle into non- Solent areas. Thus he was sincere in his disarmament suggestions and negotiations, but since he distrusted the Western Powers just as thoroughly as they distrusted him, any advance along the road to disarmament was al most hopeless. The Soviet position sought limitation of nuclear arms a nd long-range vehicles, and was much less willing to accept limits on conventional arms or ground forces. This is equivalent to saying that \" e wished to limit the United States and was reluctant to limit the Soviet u nion.

Accordingly, the Soviet disarmament proposals of April 30, 1957 were discussed month after month, and year after year, with minimal progress' By 1959 it was quite clear that the Kremlin's chief aim was to preven Germany and Red China from getting nuclear weapons. According 1 )' they concentrated on efforts to direct the disarmament discussions towar restrictions on nuclear testing and on nuclear-free zones in central Europ and in Asia. The nuclear-free zone in central Europe, which fitted in w e with a British-favored policy of \"disengagement\" in that area, was know as the Repacki Plan, after its nominal proponent, but reappeared, in van- ous versions, for many years. There can be little doubt that a central role in Soviet foreign policv was played by the Kremlin's not unjustified fear of Germany, and ' almost neurotic opposition to a unification of Germany that was not unde Soviet control, or to the acquisition by West Germany of nuclear weap ons. A stalemate on this subject was ensured by America's refusal ti accept the status quo of a divided Germany because of our devotion the Adenauer regime, and our fear that West Germany, rebuffed by u on the issue of reunification, might prefer reunity to prosperity ° democracy and make a deal with the Soviet Union to achieve sue unity.

Finally, the growing recognition that the Soviet chances were dwindling for reach- m g the kind of settlement it wanted in West Germany or West Berlin undoubtedly led many in the Kremlin to conclude that a successful em- placement of Soviet missiles in Cuba, even if there were no real inten- tion of using them, could lead to a compromise settlement under which these missiles would be removed from Cuba in return for a Berlin set- tlement more favorable to the Soviet desires. Whatever the reason for the Soviet missile buildup in Cuba, once e g u n, in August 1962, it proceeded with amazing speed. The White \"ouse was suspicious by the beginning of September, and on the 24th °t that month President Kennedy obtained from the Congress permission to call up 150,000 reservists, but aerial photography did not show missile Placements until October 15th. Soviet high altitude AA rockets (SA-2's) \"ad been identified in Cuba in August, and Ilyushin-28 jet bombers in September. The week of October 14-21 was one of steadily increasing crisis Within the United States government, although no public announcement v as made before the President's speech of Monday, October 22, 1962. 'his speech established a \"quarantine on all offensive equipment under shipment to Cuba,\" demanded dismantling of the missile sites, and with- drawal of Soviet forces under threat of stronger action by the United States, and announced that \"any missile launched from Cuba against any Nation shall be regarded as an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States, requiring full retaliation.\" The effects of this speech were explosive. To the world it began six days of crisis in which the two Superpowers hung on the brink of Nuclear war. In reality the situation was quite different. The crisis, in ac t, was an almost perfect example of a diplomatic crisis and of how Su ch a crisis should be handled. The pattern for a classic diplomatic crisis has three stages: (1) con- frontation; (2) recognition; and (3) settlement. The confrontation con- ^sts of a dispute, that is, a power challenge in some area of conflict; i a ge 2 is recognition by both sides of the realities of the power re- a tionship between them (always much easier when only two states are \"U'olved); and Stage 3 is a yielding by the weaker of the two accom- panied by an effort by the stronger to cover that retreat by refusing to 'nflict a humiliation or obvious triumph over the weaker. As Metternich said, \"A diplomat is a man who never allows himself the pleasure of a r,l imph,\" and does so simply because it is to the interest of the stronger ,hat an opponent who recognizes the victor's strength and is reasonable ln yielding to it not be overthrown or replaced by another ruler who is"},{"pageNumber":1121,"pageContent":"Ho6  TRAGEDY AND HOPE too ignorant or too unreasonable to do so.

LATIN AMERICA: A RACE BETWEEN DISASTER AND REFORM As time remorselessly moves forward through the second half of the twentieth century, a major problem for the United States is the fate of Latin America, that gigantic portion of the Western Hemisphere that | s south of the Rio Grande. It is not an area that can continue to be J gnored, because it is neither small nor remote, and its problems are both urgent and explosive. Yet, until i960, it was ignored. The Latin America that demanded attention in i960 was twice the Slz e of the United States (7.5 million square miles compared to 3.6 trillion square miles), with a population about 10 percent larger (200 million persons compared to our 180 million in i960). Brazil, which spoke Portuguese rather than Spanish, had almost half the total area With more than a third the total population (75 million in i960). In i960 \"tazil reached the end of a decade of economic and population expan- s 'on during which its economy was growing at about 7 percent a vear While its population was growing over 2.5 percent a year, both close to the fastest rates in the world. (The population increase of Asia was about 1.8 percent a year, Russia and the United States were less, while Europe was only 0.7 percent a year.) Brazil's rate of economic growth te U to about 3 percent a year after i960, while its population explosion ° e came worse, apparently trying to catch up with the Brazilian cost of wing, which rose 40 percent in 1961, 50 percent in 1962, and 70 percent m 1963."},{"pageNumber":1125,"pageContent":"IIIO  TRAGEDY AND HOPE Except for its fantastic price inflation, Brazil's problems were fairly typical of those faced by all of Latin America. These problems might be boiled down to four basic issues: (i) falling death rates, combined with continued high birthrates, are producing a population explosion unaccompanied by any comparable increase in the food supply; (2) the social disorganization resulting from such population increase, combined with a flooding of people from rural areas into urban slums, is reflected in disruption of family life, spreading crime and immorality, totally inadequate education and other social services, and growing despair; (3) the ideological patterns of Latin America, which were always uncon- structive, are being replaced by newer, equally unconstructive but explosively violent, doctrines; and (4) there is simultaneously an un- necessary spreading of modern weapons and a growing disequilibrium between the control of such arms and the disintegrating social structure and the increasing social and political pressures just mentioned. Some of the more obvious consequences of these four problems mig nt be mentioned here. Latin America is not only poverty-ridden, but the distribution of wealth and income is so unequal that the most ostentatious luxury exists for a small group side by side with the most degrading poverty for the overwhelming majority, with a growing but very small group in De \" tween. The average yearly per capita income for all of Latin America was about $253 in i960, ranging from $800 in Venezuela to $95 in Paraguay and $70 in Haiti. The distribution is so unequal, however, that four-fifths of the population of Latin America get about $53 a >\" ear ' while a mere 100 families own 9/10 of the native-owned wealth of the whole area and only 30 families own 72 percent of that wealth. 1hi disequilibrium is seen most clearly in landholding, on which more than half the population, because of the area's economic backwardness, 1 dependent. Agrarian reform (land redistribution), which seems attrac- tive to many but is reallv no solution so long as the peasants lack capita and technical know-how, has been carried out, to some extent, in few countries (such as Mexico or Bolivia), but, in Latin America g en \" erally, landholding is still very unequal. In Brazil, for example, half 0 all land is owned by 2.6 percent of the landowners, while 22.5 p erce of all the land is held by only l / 2 percent of the owners.

We shall return in a moment to the disastrous ideological pat- terns that lie behind this attitude. Almost equally indicative of an unhealthy society is the age distri- bution within that society and the failure to provide education and health protection. About half of Latin America's population is unproduc- tive and a social burden on the other half because it falls into the two groups of the young (below 15 years) or the old (over 65 years). This compares with onlv 26 percent of the population in these dependent groups in the United States. Such a distribution, in a healthy society, would require very considerable direction of resources into such social services as education, health protection, and retirement security. All such services in Latin America are painfully inadequate. About two- thirds of Latin Americans are illiterate, and those who may be classified as literate have very inadequate schooling. The average Latin American has had less than two years of schooling, but, like all averages, this one is misleading, since it covers both Paraguay (where very few children ever get near a school) and Castro's Cuba (where, we are told, illiteracy has been wiped out and all children of school age up to 15 are supposed t° be in school). Leaving out these two countries, we find that in 1961 ln 18 other Latin American countries only 38 percent of the population had finished two years of school, while only 7 percent had finished Primary school, and one out of a hundred had attended a university. The inadequacy of health protection in Latin America is as startling as the inadequacy of education, but may not, in a wider frame, be so objectionable. For if health were better protected, more people would survive, and the problems of scarce food and scarce jobs would have readied the explosive point long ago. Unfortunately, this problem of health and death rates has a very great impact on humanitarian North American observers, with the consequence that a considerable portion °f the funds for development provided by the Alliance for Progress since 1961 are aimed at reducing these evils of disease and death. Since this effort is bound to be more successful than the much smaller funds aimed at increasing the food supply, the net consequence of these efforts Will be to give Latin America more and hungrier people. As things stood in i960, infant mortality varied between 20 and 35 Percent in different countries. Even in the Latin American country with the lowest death rate for the first year of life (Uruguay with 25 deaths per thousand births), the rate is ten times as high as in the United States (2.6 per thousand), while in Latin America as a whole it was 56 Per thousand, rising to about 90 per thousand in Guatemala.

The problems of Latin America are not based on lack of anything, but on structural weaknesses. Solu- tions will not rest on anything that can be done to or for individual people but on the arrangements of peoples. Even the greatest evil of the area, the selfish and mistaken outlook of the dominant social groups, cannot be changed by persuading individuals but must be changed by modifying the patterns of social relationships that are creating such outlooks. The key to the salvation of Latin America, and much of the rest of the world, rests on that word: \"patterns.\" Latin America has the resources, the manpower, the capital accumulation, even perhaps the know-how to provide a viable and progressive society. What it lacks are constructive patterns—patterns of power, of social life, and, above all, of outlook—that will mobilize its resources in constructive rather than destructive directions. Failure to recognize that Latin America's weaknesses are not based on lack of substance but on lack of constructive patterns is one of the two chief reasons why the future of Latin America looks so discour- aging. The other reason is failure to recognize that the chief problem > n planning Latin America's future is that of establishing a constructive sequence of priorities. In fact, these two problems: obtaining construc- tive patterns and obtaining a constructive sequence of priorities, are the keys to salvation of all the underdeveloped and backward areas or the globe. We might sum up this general situation by saying that the salvation of our poor, harassed globe depends on structure and sequence (or on patterns and priorities). In applying these two paradigms to Latin American development, we shall find that the problem of priorities is much easier to solve than the problem of patterns. Obviously, the birthrate must decrease before any vigorous efforts are made to reduce the death rate. Or the food supply must be increased faster than the population. And some provi- sion must be made to provide peasants with capital and know-how before the great landed estates are divided up among them. Equally urgent « the caution that some provision for capital accumulation and its invest- ment in better methods of production must be made before the present accumulation of excess incomes in the hands of the existing oligarchies is destroyed by redistribution of the incomes of the rich (who could invest it) to the poor (who could only consume it). It should be obvious (but unfortunately is not) that a more productive organization of re- sources should have priority over any effort to raise standards of living- And it should be equally obvious that Latin America's own resources (including its own capital accumulation and its own know-how) shoul be devoted to this effort before the responsibility for Latin American"},{"pageNumber":1128,"pageContent":"THE NEW ERA, I 95 7-I 964  11 I 3 economic development is placed on the resources of North Americans 0r other outsiders. This last point might be amplified. We hear a great deal about Latin America's need for American capital and American know-how, when in ta ct the need for these is much less than the need for utilization of Latin America's own capital and know-how. The wealth and income of Latin America, in absolute quantities, is so great and it is so inequitably con- rolled and distributed that there is an enormous accumulation of in- comes, far beyond their consumption needs, in the hands of a small Percentage of Latin Americans. Much of these excess incomes are lasted, hoarded, or merely used for wasteful competition in ostentatious ^cial display. This, as we shall see, is largely due to the deficiencies of Latin American personalities and character. The contrast, from this point °f view, between England in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries an d Latin America in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is very 'istructive. In both cases there was such a drastic inequity in the distri- u tion of national incomes that the masses of the people were in abject Poverty and probably getting poorer. But in England there were groups en efiting from this inequality who eschewed all self-indulgence, luxury, ° r ostentatious display of wealth, and systematically invested their s r o\\ving incomes in creating new and more efficient patterns of utili- atl on of resources. This is in sharp contrast to the situation in Latin ^crica where such excess wealth, in the aggregate, is much greater lar > that being accumulated, a century or more ago, in England, but is er y largely wasted and surely is not being used to create more produc- 1Ve patterns for utilization of resources, except in rare cases. . The solution to this problem is not, as we have said, to redistribute \"iconics in Latin America, but to change the patterns of character and 0r personality formation so that excess incomes will be used construc- 1Ve ly and not wasted (nor simply redistributed and consumed). A similar situation exists in regard to foreign exchange. Alternately ° Ur compassion is stirred and our anger aroused by American reformers a,lc i Latin agitators at the iniquities of the colonial character of Latin America's position in the world economy. This simply means that Latin America exports raw materials, minerals, and agricultural products (gen- ially unprocessed goods), and imports processed, manufactured goods. lr) ce the prices of unprocessed goods are generally more competitive, and therefore more fluctuating, than those of manufactured goods, the so-called \"terms of trade\" tend to run either favorably for or very un- lav orably against Latin America.

Now, this is perfectly true. The Latin American economy is largely a colonial one (like Australia, New Zealand, West Africa, or Montana)- In fact, in Latin America, in recent years, at least half the value pi American aid has been wiped away by the worsening of Latin America s terms of trade, which made it necessary for it to pay more and more foreign moneys for its imports at the same time that it got less and less foreign moneys for its exports. But the fact remains that this reduction in the supply of foreign exchange available for Latin America's p ur ' chases of advanced equipment overseas has been made much worse 0) the fact that wealthy Latin Americans buy up much of the availa\" supply of such foreign exchange for self-indulgent and nonconstructiv spending abroad or simply to hoard their incomes in politically safe areas in New York, London, or Switzerland. Estimates of the total _ such Latin American hoards abroad range between one billion and tw billion dollars. The solution to this problem must be found in more response < more public-spirited, and more constructive patterns of outlook, money flows, and of political and social security. A similar solution must be found for some of the social dcficienc - of Latin America, such as inadequate education, housing, and soc stability. Widespread tax evasion by the rich; bribery and corruption public life; and brutalitv and selfishness in social life can be reduced a largely eliminated in Latin America by changing patterns in l- a American life and utilization of resources without much need for fu nah ' sermons, or demonstrations from foreigners (least of all Americans)- This is not an argument for a reduction in American aid or in Am ican concern for Latin America. It is a plea for recognition, by concerned, that the problems of Latin America, and the possible so tions to these problems, rest on questions of structure and sequence a not on questions of resources, wealth, or even know-how. The connection of that last word \"know-how\" to the whole pr° D e mav not be sufficiently clear. We Americans have such pride m technological achievements that we often seem to feel that we ' kn how\" to do almost everything, but this know-how really exists on levels.

The former level has a great deal to contribute the Latin American situation, while the latter level (the engine^ 1 - level, so to speak) has much less to contribute to Latin America most people believe. For example, American agricultural techruq which are so fantastically successful in the temperate seasonal cW\""},{"pageNumber":1130,"pageContent":"THE NEW ERA, 1957-1964  III5  and well-watered and alluvial soils of North America, are frequently quite unadapted to the tropical, less seasonal climate, and semiarid, Cached soils of South America. The solution to the Latin American problem of food production is not necessarily to apply North American techniques to the problem, but to discover techniques, different from °ur own, that will work under Latin American conditions. This situation, a Pplied here to agriculture, is even more true of social and ideological problems. The problem of finding constructive patterns for Latin America is tuuch more difficult than the problem of finding constructive priorities, yrie reason for this is that the unconstructive patterns that now prevail ln Latin America are deeply entrenched as a result of centuries and ev en millennia of persistent background. In fact, the Latin American patterns that must be changed because todav thev are leading to social and cultural disruption are not really Latin American in origin, or even lo erian for that matter, but are Near Eastern, and go back, for some °' their aspects, for two thousand or more years. As a general statement, Nv 'e might say that the Latin American cultural pattern (including per- sonality patterns and general outlook) is Arabic, while its social pattern ls that of Asiatic despotism. The pattern as a whole is so prevalent today, not only in Latin America, but in Spain, Sicilv, southern Italy, tne Near East, and in various other areas of the Mediterranean world (such as Egypt), that we might well call it the \"Pakistani-Peruvian axis.\" or convenience of analysis we shall divide it into \"Asiatic despotism\" and the \"Arabic outlook.\" We have already indicated the nature of Asiatic despotism in con- nection with traditional China, the old Ottoman Empire, and czarist Russia. It goes back to the archaic Bronze Age empires, which first appeared in Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indus Valley, and northern China , efore iooo B.C. Basically such an Asiatic despotism is a two-class society U which a lower class, consisting of at least nine-tenths of the popu- a tion, supports an upper, ruling class consisting of several interlocking groups. These ruling groups are a governing bureaucracy of scribes and Pt'ests associated with army leaders, landlords, and moneylenders. Such , n upper class accumulated great quantities of wealth as taxes, rents, uterest on loans, fees for services, or simply as financial extortions. The °cial consequences were either progressive or reactionary, depending on Aether this accumulated wealth in the possession of the ruling class ^ ;ls invested in more productive utilization of resources or was simply Qarded and wasted. The essential character of such an Asiatic despotism Cst s on the fact that the ruling class has legal claims on the working , las ses, and possesses the power (from its control of arms and the polit- Ca ' structure) to enforce these claims. A modified Asiatic despotism is n e aspect of the social structures all along the Pakistani-Peruvian axis."},{"pageNumber":1131,"pageContent":"I I 16  TRAGEDY AND HOPE The other aspect of the Pakistani-Peruvian axis rests on its Arabic outlook. The Arabs, like other Semites who emerged from the Arabian desert at various times to infiltrate the neighboring Asiatic despotic cul- tures of urban civilizations, were, originally, nomadic, tribal peoples- Their political structure was practically identical with their social struc- ture and was based on blood relationships and not on territorial juris- diction. Thev were warlike, patriarchal, extremist, violent, intolerant, and xenophobic. Like most tribal peoples, their political structure WW totalitarian in the sense that all values, all needs, and all meaning' 11 human experience was contained within the tribe. Persons outside the tribal structure had no value or significance, and there were no obl'g 3 \" tions or meaning associated in contacts with them. In fact, they were hardly regarded as human beings at all. Moreover, within the tribe' social significance became more intense as blood relationships became closer, moving inward from the tribes through clans to the patriarch 3 extended family. The sharp contrast between such a point of view atl that associated with Christian society as we know it can be seen in ttic fact that such Semitic tribalism was endogamous, while the rule o Christian marriage is exogamous. The rules, in fact, were directly anti- thetical, since Arabic marriage favors unions of first cousins, wni Christian marriage has consistently opposed marriage of first (or e ve second) cousins.

The personal character of such unions and the patriarchal nature of the basic family units tended to make all political relationships personal and temporary, reflections of the desires or whims of the leader and not the consequence or reflection of any basic social relationships. This tended to prevent the development of any advanced conception of the state, law, a nd the community (as achieved, for example, by the once tribal Greeks a nd Romans). Within the family, rules were personal, patriarchal, and often arbitrary and changeable, arising from the will and often from the whims of the patriarch. This prevented the development of any advanced ideas of reciprocal common interests whose interrelationships, o>' establishing a higher social structure, created, at the same time, rules superior to the individual, rules of an impersonal and permanent char- ac ter in which law created authority and not, as in the Arabic system, authority created law (or at least temporary rules). To this day the shattered cultures along the whole Pakistani-Peruvian axis have a very H'eak grasp of the nature of a community or of any obligation to such a community, and regard law and politics as simply personal relationships ^'hose chief justification is the power and position of the individual who 'ssues the orders. The state, as a structure of force more remote and therefore less personal than the immediate family, is regarded as an alien and exploitative personal system to be avoided and evaded simply be- cause it is more remote (even if of similar character) than the indi- y'dual's immediate family. This biological and patriarchal character of all significant social rela- t'onships in Arab life is reflected in the familiar feature of male domi- nance. Only the male is important. The female is inferior, even subhuman, and becomes significant only bv producing males (the one thing, apparently, that the dominant male cannot do for himself). Be- cause of the strong patrilocal character of Arab marriage, a new wife is n ot only subjected sexually to her husband; she is also subjected socially and personally to his family, including his brothers, and, above all, his niother (who has gained this position of domination over other females ln the house by having produced male children). Sex is regarded almost Solely as simply a physiological relationship with little emphasis on the re %ious, emotional, or even social aspects. Love, meaning concern for the personality or developing potentialities of the sexual partner, plays httle role in Arabic sexual relationships. The purpose of such relation- ships in the eyes of the average Arab is to relieve his own sexual desir*' ° r to generate sons."},{"pageNumber":1133,"pageContent":"IIlS  TRAGEDY AND HOPE Such sons are brought up in an atmosphere of whimsical, arbitrary, personal rules where they are regarded as superior beings by their mother and sisters and, inevitably, by their father and themselves, simply on the basis of their maleness. Usually they are spoiled, undisciplined self-indulgent, and unprincipled. Their whims are commands, their urges are laws. They are exposed to a dual standard of sexual morality i n which any female is a legitimate target of their sexual desires, but the girl they marry is expected to be a paragon of chaste virginity. The original basis for this emphasis on a bride's virginity rested on the emphasis on blood descent and was intended to be a guarantee of the paternity of children. The wife, as a child-producing mechanism, had to produce the children of one known genetic line and no other. This emphasis on the virginity of any girl who could be regarded as acceptable as a wife was carried to extremes. The loss of a gi rls virginity was regarded as an unbearable dishonor bv the girl's family, and any girl who brought such dishonor on a family was regarded as worthy of death at the hands of her father and brothers. Once she is married, the right to punish such a transgression is transferred to he husband. To any well-bred girl, her premarital virginity and the reservation of sexual access to her husband's control after marriage (\"her honor ; have pecuniary value. Since she has no value in herself as a person, apart from \"her honor,\" and has little value as a worker of any sort, he virginity- before marriage has a value in money equal to the expense o keeping her for much of her life since, indeed, this is exactly what was worth in money. As a virgin she could expect the man who ° tained her in marriage to regard that asset as equivalent to his recipr° c obligation to support her as a wife. As a matter of fact, her virgin 11 ) was worth much less than that, for in traditional Arabic society, if s displeased her husband, even if she merely crossed one of his whims, could set her aside by divorce, a process very easy for him, with htt delay or obligation, but impossible to achieve on her part, no matt how eagerly she might desire it. Moreover, once her virginity was g° n ' she had little value as a wife or a person, unless she had mothere son, and could be passed along from man to man, either in marriage otherwise, with little social obligation on anyone's part. As a result such easy divorce, and the narrow physiological basis on which sex relationships are based, plus the lack of value of a woman once virginity is gone, Arab marriage is very fragile, with divorce and bro c , marriage about twice as frequent as in the United States.

Not more than 5 percent of married men in the Near East today have more than one wife at the same time, because of the expense, but the num- ber who remain in monogamous union till death is almost equally small. As might be expected in such a societv, Arabic bovs grow up egocen- tric, self-indulgent, undisciplined, immature, spoiled, subject to waves of emotionalism, whims, passion, and pettiness. The consequence of this for the whole Pakistani-Peruvian axis will be seen in a moment. Another aspect of Arabic societv is its scorn of honest, steady manual Work, especially agricultural work. This is a consequence of the fusion °f at least three ancient influences. First, the archaic bureaucratic struc- ture of Asiatic despotism, in which peasants supported warriors and Sc ribes, regarded manual workers, especially tillers of the soil, as the lowest layer of society, and regarded the acquisition of literacy and military prowess as the chief roads to escape from physical drudgery. Second, the fact that Classical Antiquity, whose influence on the subse- quent Islamic Civilization was very great, was based on slavery, and came to regard agricultural (or other manual) work as fit for slaves, also contributed to this idea. Third, the Bedouin tradition of pastoral, war- \"ke nomads scorned tillers of the soil as weak and routine persons of n ° real spirit or character, fit to be conquered or walked on but not to De respected. The combination of these three formed the lack of respect Wr manual work that is so characteristic of the Pakistani-Peruvian axis. Somewhat similar to this lack of respect for manual work are a number W other characteristics of traditionl Arab life that have also spread the ) e ngth of the Pakistani-Peruvian axis. The chief source of many of these ls the Bedouin outlook, which originally reflected the attitudes of a relatively small group of the Islamic culture but which, because they were a superior, conquering group, came to be copied by others in the society, even by the despised agricultural workers. These attitudes in- clude lack of respect for the soil, for vegetation, for most animals, and t0r outsiders. These attitudes, which are singularly ill-fitted for the geographic and climatic conditions of the whole Pakistani-Peruvian area, are to be seen constantly in the everyday life of that area as erosion, destruction of vegetation and wild life, personal cruelty and callousness 0 most living things, including one's fellow men, and a general harshness ar, d indifference to God's creation. This final attitude, which well re- jects the geographic conditions of the area, which seem as harsh and \"different as man himself, is met by those men who must face it in their uaily life as a resigned submission to fate and to the inhumanity of man to man. Interestingly enough, these attitudes have successfully survived the tt°rts of the three great religions of ethical monotheism, native to the"},{"pageNumber":1135,"pageContent":"II20  TRAGEDY AND HOPE area, to change these attitudes. The ethical sides of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam sought to counteract harshness, egocentricity, tribalism, cruelty, scorn of work and of one's fellow creatures, but these efforts, on the whole, have met with little success throughout the length of the Pakistani-Peruvian axis. Of the three, Christianity, possibly because » set the highest standards of the three, has fallen furthest from achieving its aims. Love, humility, brotherhood, cooperation, the sanctity of work, the fellowship of the community, the image of man as a fellow creature made in the image of God, respect for women as personalities and part\" ners of men, mutual helpmates on the road to spiritual salvation, and the vision of our universe, with all its diversity, complexity, and multitude of creatures, as a reflection of the power and goodness of God—these basic aspects of Christ's teachings are almost totally lacking throughout the Pakistani-Peruvian axis and most notably absent on the \"Christian portion of that axis from Sicily, or even the Aegean Sea, westward to Baja California and Tierra del Fuego. Throughout the whole axis, human actions are not motivated by these \"Christian virtues\" but by the more ancient Arabic personality traits, which became vices and sins in the Christian outlook: harshness, envy, lust, greed, selfishness, cruelty» and hatred. Islam, the third in historical sequence of the ethical monotheistic religions of the Near East, was very successful in establishing its mono- theism, but had only very moderate success in spreading its version o Jewish and Christian ethics to the Arabs. These moderate successes were counterbalanced by other, incidental consequences of Muhammad's p er \" sonal life and of the way in which Islam spread to make the Muslin religion more rigid, absolute, uncompromising, self-centered, and dog- matic. The failure of Christianity in the areas west from Sicily was even greater, and was increased by the spread of Arab outlooks and influence to that area, and especially to Spain. The old French proverb which saV s that \"Africa begins at the Pyrenees\" does not, of course, mean by \"Africa\" that Black Africa which exists south of the deserts, but means the world of the Arabs which spread, in the eighth century, across Africa from Sinai to Morocco. To this day the Arab influence is evident in southern Italy, northern Africa and, above all, in Spain. It appears in the obvious things sucn as architecture, music, the dance, and literature, but most prominently it appears in outlook, attitudes, motivations, and value systems. Spain ana Latin America, despite centuries of nominal Christianity, are Arabic areas. No statement is more hateful to Spaniards and Latin Americans than that.

In fact, the antagonism helped to build up those very traits that I have called Arabic: intolerance, self- esteem, hatred, militarization, cruelty, dogmatism, rigidity, harshness, suspicion of outsiders, and the rest of it. The Arab traits that were not engendered by this antagonism were built up by emulation—the tendency of a conquered people to copy their conquerors, no matter now much they profess to hate them, simply because they are a superior social class. From this emulation came the Spanish and Latin American attitudes toward sex, family structure, and child-rearing that a re the distinctive features of Spanish-speaking life today and that make Spanish-speaking areas so ambiguously part of Western Civilization in spite of their nominal allegiance to such an essential Western trait as Christianity. For the West, even as it nominally ceases to be Christian, a nd most obviously in those areas which have, at least nominally, drifted furthest from Christianity, still has many of the basic Christian traits °f love, humility, social concern, humanitarianism, brotherly care, and future preference, however detached these traits may have become from the Christian idea of deity or of individual salvation in a spiritual eternity. In I ^atin America the Mediterranean version of Arabized life again f«und its traits preserved, and sometimes reinforced, bv the historical process. In Latin America non-Spanish influences, chiefly Indian, Negro, a nd North American, can be observed in such things as music, dances, superstitions, agricultural crops and diet (largely Indian), or in trans- portation, communications, and weapons (largely European); but the \"asic structures of family and social life, of ideological patterns and values are, to this day, largely those of the Arabic end of the Pakistani- Peruvian axis. The Iberian conquest of Latin America, not as an area of settlement hut as an area of exploitation, and the Spanish attitude toward the Indians a nd Negro slaves as instruments in that exploitative process, the develop- ment of plantation colonialism, and of mineral extraction, intensified the exploitative, ransacking, extensive attitude toward resources and peoples Which the Mediterranean area had obtained from the Romans and the Saracens. None of these activities became permanent community traits for those involved in them, even for the underlings who operated as P a rt of the exploitative way of life, but remained temporary, get-rich- 9\"ick methods of mercenary gain for persons who regarded themselves as strangers whose roots were elsewhere, or nowhere.

To this day, the characteristics we have listed as Arabic dominate Latin America: no real concern for the soil, the area, for workers, one's fellow men, or the community as a whole; the dominance of family connection and or masculine dominance with its dual standard of sexual morality, its cult of virility, its selfishness, self-indulgence, lack of self-discipline or of concern for others; and the whole Mediterranean view of politics as a system of exploitative, personal relationships of an arbitrary and corrupt character combining extortion, bribery, tax evasion, and total divorce from community spirit or personal responsibility for the welfare ot others or of the nation. This picture of Latin America and its problems will be resented and criticized by many as exaggerated, one-sided, or even as mistaken- Naturally, in view of its brevity, it is oversimplified, as all brief exposi- tions must be. And equally naturally all its statements do not apply t() all groups, all areas, all classes, or all individuals. There are numerous exceptions to large portions of this picture, but thev are exception and are explicable as such. And there are obviously different degrees of emphasis among various groups, backgrounds, and periods. Thes again are explicable.

By the word \"re- form\" we mean that the power pattern, the economic and social pattern, and the ideological pattern be reorganized in more constructive config- urations rather than on the destructive patterns in which they now exist. And of these three, the patterns of ideology—that is, of outlook and value systems—are most in need of change. Of course, in any society it is pre- cisely this pattern of outlook and values that is most difficult to modify. In most societies this remains unchanged—repeated in slogans, war cries, and religious incantations long after the behavioral and structural patterns have changed completely. But in Latin America there is this ray of hope. A more constructive ideological pattern is already familiar, at least in ^ v 'ords, to Latin America: Christianity. The whole system is full of paradox and contradiction. The real ob- stacle to progress and hope in Latin America rests in the oligarchy, not so much because it controls the levers of power and wealth but because tt is absorbed in the destructive Latin American ideology. But the real hope in the area rests in the same oligarchy, because it controls wealth and power, and also because there is no hope at all unless it changes its 'deology. The ideology it could adopt is one that places emphasis on Se lf-discipline, service to others, love, and equality, but these virtues, al- most wholly lacking in practice in Latin America, are the very ones that are, in words, embodied in the Christian religion to which the oligarchy °f Latin America nominally belongs. In a word, Latin America would be On the road to reform if it practiced what it preached, that is, if it tried to be Christian. Of course, we cannot really say that the solution lies in practice of what one preaches, the Christian virtues, because Latin Amer- lc an religion, like everything else, is largely corrupt and, as a conse- quence, no longer preaches the Christian virtues. The upper clergy have been generally allied to the oligarchy; the lower clergy are as pov- erty-stricken and almost as ignorant as their fellow poor in lay society. Moreover, both levels of clergy have come to accept the outlook and v 'alues of the society in which they live. The message of Christ itself, a Positive message of action, has been lost in the negative messages of the Catholic clergy reacting within a corrupt society drenched in the non- Christian outlook that dominates the oligarchy as a whole. Only in recent years has there been much change in this situation. In most of Latin America, the Church's failure is recorded in the fact that the great mass of Latin American people, especially those below the level °f the oligarchy itself, ignore it or reject it, just as they do in Spain. And especially the dominant males have rejected it, except as a social necessity, or an antirevolutionary force, or as a refuge for their martyr- obsessed women. But the advent of Pope John XXIII has had a profound 'nfluence on the Church by recalling it from its interests and crass power relationships to the content of Christ's message. The degree to which this"},{"pageNumber":1139,"pageContent":"I 124  TRAGEDY AND HOPE can change the clergy's negative injunctions against adultery, Commu- nism, and criminal acts into positive exhortations to acts of social benefit, help, and love is problematical. And even more dubious is the question if it is not going to be too little and too late. This is, indeed, the great question with which all talk of reform in Latin America must end: \"» s there still time?\" There was time enough in 1940, when the demands of war in Europe began to push awav the acute problems and controversies that had arisen from the world depression, the rise of Fascism, and the Spanish Civil War of the 1930's. World War II, by increasing the demand for Latin America's mineral and agricultural products, pushed starvation and con- troversy away from the immediate present and into the more remote fu- ture. Unfortunately, nothing constructive was done with the time thus gained, and, almost equally tragic, little constructive use was made of the wealth brought to Latin America by the demands of war elsewhere on the globe. Latin America boomed: the rich became richer; the poor had more children. A few poor, or at least not rich, became rich, or at least richer. But nothing was done to modify the basic pattern of Latin Amer- ican power, wealth, and outlook. The wars of independence that ended Latin America's political con- nection with Spain and Portugal did not destroy the power of the upper- class oligarchies or change their outlooks, except to make them somewhat more local. It was about a century, say from 1830 to 1930, before the oligarchic alliance of armv, landlords, bankers, and upper clergy w3S seriously challenged in their exploitation of their peasant subjects or the natural resources of their local areas. This challenge, which first appeared in Mexico in 1910, was a conse- quence of the commercialization and, much later, the incipient industrial- ization of Latin American society. The same influences, reinforced by other developments, such as growing literacy, population increase, a ncl the introduction of new ideas of European and North American orig\" 1 ' served to weaken the union of the older oligarchic groups so that the solidarity of the military with the other three groups was much reduced. This process of commercialization and incipient industrialization 01 Latin American society was largely a consequence of foreign investments, which introduced railroads, tram lines, faster communications, large-scale mining, some processing of raw materials, the introduction of electricity, waterworks, telephones, and other public utilities, and the beginnings or efforts to produce supplies for these new activities. These efforts served to create two new and quite divergent social classes which began to n» the gap between the older rural dichotomy of oligarchy and peasantry- The new classes, both largely urban, were labor and bourgeoisie. B° r \" were infected by the class-struggle ideologies of European Social' st groups, so that the new laboring masses sought to be unionized a n \""},{"pageNumber":1140,"pageContent":"THE NEW ERA, 1957-1964  II25  radical. Both groups were much more political than the old peasant class had ever been. A chief consequence of the whole development was the urbanization and radicalization of Latin American society. From the political point of view, these developments made the power relationships of Latin America much more complex and unpredictable, ror one thing, the army was no longer completely dependent on the landlord groups for support, but found, on the contrary, that its urban oases were under pressure of local labor-union controls of its supplies, while its relations with the bourgeois groups were much more ambigu- ous than its relations with the landlord group had been previously. At tne same time, the influence of the clergy was generally weakened by Cf ie influx of anticlerical ideas of European origin into both the new ur- ban groups and, to a much smaller extent, to the peasants. These changes have not occurred in all areas of Latin America. In- deed, many areas remain much as they were in 1880. But in Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil the process has gone far enough to modify the whole social pattern, while in some lesser areas like Bolivia, Uruguay, <~osta Rica and, above all, Cuba, drastic changes have been occurring. 'n Mexico the revolution has continued for more than half a century. UUring at least half of that period, the chief problem was the control of nil 'itarism, a task that must be done in all of Latin America. In its early \"ays, the Mexican Revolution was distracted from constructive change °y a number of destructive efforts. For example, its attacks on foreign Ca pital led to more damage than good by curtailing foreign investment and foreign technological skills. At the same time, its emphasis on agrar- J an reform distracted attention from the real agricultural problem to the P s eudoproblem of landownership; the real problem is that of increasing agricultural production, regardless of agrarian arrangements. These three e arly problems have been to some extent overcome. The Mexican Army ls now largely professionalized and relatively nonpolitical and responsive to civilian controls. For more than a generation now, the army has not overthrown a government. At the same time, political stability has been 'ncreased by the depersonalization of political life, by circulation of leadership within one dominant party, by the establishment of some Political principles, including the very significant one of no reelection of the president, and by the use of political power to encourage some pro- gressive tendencies, such as more public funds for education than for °- e fense, encouragement of improved communications and transport, of foreign investment, and of balanced economic development. Many acute Problems remain, such as an exploding population, acute poverty, and a Ver y low level of social welfare, but things have been moving, and in a hopeful direction.

The problems of life have not been solved in Mexico, but valuable time has been won. Efforts of other countries to follow in Mexico's footsteps have been less successful and even disastrous. In Argentina patterns of life have be- come less constructive during the last generation, despite the fact tha Argentina has been less burdened with population and more endowe with resources than other countries in Latin America. But lack of mora principles and excess self-indulgence has betrayed all efforts to obtain better patterns of life. This was evident in the career of Juan D. Perots an army officer who came to power by a coup d'etat in 1943 and sough to base that control on an alliance of the military with the workers, f built up a strong labor movement, but his concern with maintaining n own power, his lack of any over-all plan, and his basically unprincipie outlook led to a disintegration of his movement and his overthrow by h own military forces in IQ\\<;.

The disintegration of Argentina, which lacked the basic problems tha have haunted most Latin American countries, helps to demonstrate t\" significant role played in Latin American backwardness by unconstrut tive patterns, especially patterns of outlook. Argentina did not have sue problems as excess population, lack of capital, poor and unbalanced r sources, extreme poverty, social disorganization, or illiteracy (which below 10 percent), but the argumentative and divisive nature of SOCB attitudes is as prevalent in Argentina as elsewhere on the Pakistani Peruvian axis, and is the consequence along the whole length or tn axis of the egocentric and undisciplined way in which sons are broug up b\\' their mothers.

In Latin America the opposite is true, each person tries to emphasize his individuality by finding more a more features of his life (often artificial ones) that distinguish or opp° him to others.

It is the splitting °f these groups, especially of the middle classes, that has given such in- fluence in Argentina to the labor unions on the Left or the landlord group on the Right. The middle classes in Argentina have been split ln to two political parties that refuse to cooperate. Together they could Poll at least half the total vote in any election, but instead each obtains a quarter or less of the total vote and, refusing to join each other, must see k a majority by coalition with smaller, extremist parties. The failure of Latin America to find solutions to its most urgent real problems are, thus, much more fundamental than the cliches of political controversy, the complexion of governments, or the presence or absence °r \"revolutionaries.\" The words Left, Center, or Right mean little in terms °* solutions to Latin America's problems, since disorganization, corrup- ion, violence, and fraud are endemic in all. Bolivia, which has had a revo- utionary government of peasants and tin miners since 1952, is in a mess, an a Nicaragua, which has been under control of a military-dominated °%archy for almost thirty years, is in a similar mess. So long as any rc al solutions of Latin America's problems depend upon the slow build- ln g up of constructive patterns, including ideological patterns, no solu- 'on will be found in shifting power or property from one group to an- ther, even if the beneficent group in such transfers is much larger. This ailure of social and economic revolutions to achieve more constructive patterns is evident in Bolivia, Guatemala, and Cuba. Bolivia's problems always seemed hopeless. In three unsuccessful wars } Vlt h Chile, Brazil, and Paraguay from 1879 to 1935, it lost territory to te neighbors, including its only outlet to the sea. Its population of less nan three million in 1950 (3.6 million a decade later) was crowded on lts bleak western plateau, over 12,000 feet up, while its subtropical east- er n lowlands were inhabited by only a few wild Indians. These lowlands an d its mineral resources, source of 95 percent of its foreign exchange vmostly from tin), were Bolivia's chief assets before the revolution of °S2, but the former were unused, while the tin earnings went chiefly 0 swell the foreign holdings of three greedy groups, Patino and Aramayo (both Bolivian) and Hochschild (Argentine).

Paz Estcnssoro returned from exile to become president, with Juan Lechin, leader of th e revolutionary tin miners' union, as his chief aid. Within a year, pressure from the tin miners and from the peasants (canjpesinos) forced the new regime to nationalize the mines and to break up many of the large estates into small peasant holdings. Produc- tion of metals and of food both collapsed, the miners demanding m° r ^ pay and shorter hours for less and less work, driving Bolivian costs 0 production above the world market price for tin, thus wiping out a nia)° part of the country's foreign-exchange earnings. These fell from $'5°'' 770,000 (96 percent from metals) in 1951 to $63,240,000 (86 percen from metals) in 1958. To make matters worse, as Bolivian costs of K rose, the world price of tin collapsed in 1957 when the Soviet Union, for the first time, came into the world markets with low-priced tin- these same years, Bolivia's production of food for the market, whic had never been sufficient, was reduced by the transformation of torg estates producing for market into small farms producing for subsistence' The nationalization of the railways used to export Bolivia's metals prove as disastrous as the nationalization of the mines, and bv 1961 only eign ' een of sixtv main-line locomotives were still functioning. As might ne expected under such a regime, price inflation drove the value of Bolivia monetary unit down from an official rate of 190 to the dollar in '954 to an open market rate of 12,000 to the dollar in 1958.

But the problem remained critical. Manufactured goods fell from $55.7 million in 1955 to about $40 million in value in 1962, while agricultural goods for sale fell from $132.6 million to $118.7 million in 1959-1961.

Bolivia's intelligent and hard-working Indians, once hopelessly dull, morose, and sullen, are now \"right, hopeful, and self-reliant. Even their clothing is gradually shifting riom the older funereal black to brighter colors and variety. Few contrasts could be more dramatic than that between the Bolivian revolutionary government (in which a moderate regime was pushed toward radicalism by popular pressures, and survived, year after year, *ith American assistance) and the Guatemala revolution where a Com- munist-inspired regime tried to lead a rather inert population in the direction of increasing radicalism but was overthrown by direct Amer- 'can action within three years (1951-1954). Guatemala is one of the \"banana republics.\" This perishable fruit, With a world production of 26 billion pounds a year, forms 40 percent °f the world's trade in fresh fruit, with almost 70 percent of the world's total produced in Latin America and almost 57 percent of all the world's °anana exports going to North America. The retail value of Latin Amer- 1Ca s part of the world's trade in bananas is several billion dollars a year, Du t Latin America gets less than 7 percent of that value. One reason for this is the existence of the United Fruit Company, which owns two mil- lion acres of plantations in six Latin American countries, with 1,500 miles °» railroad, 60 ships, seaports, and communications networks. This cor- poration handles about a third of the world's banana sales and about \"Vo-thirds of the American sales. It controls 60 percent of the banana ex ports of the six banana republics (Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama) and accounts for over 40 percent of the oreign-exchange earnings in three of the six countries. It pays about *'45 million a year into the six countries, and claims to earn about $26 Million profits on its $159 million investment each year, but this profit \"gure of about 16.6 percent a vear is undoubtedly far below the true \"gure. A United States suit against United Fruit in 1954-1958 claimed that the latter controlled 85 percent of the land suitable for banana culti- vation in five countries, and ordered it to get rid of most of its subsidiary transportation, distribution, and land operations by 1970.

Guatemala, like Bolivia, has a population that consists largely of W* 3 poverished Indians and mixed bloods (mestizos). From 1931 to 1944 these were ruled by the dictator Jorge Ubico, the last of a long line of corrupt and ruthless tyrants. When he retired to die in New Orleans in 1944, free elections chose Juan Jose Arevalo (1945-1950) and Jacobo Arbenz Guzman (1950-1954) as presidents. Reform was long overdue, and these two administrations tried to provide it, becoming increasingly anti-American and pro-Communist over their nine-vear rule. When they began, civil or political rights were almost totally unknown, and i4 : persons (including corporations) owned 98 percent of the arable land- Free speech and press, legalized unions, and free elections preceded the work of reform, but opposition from the United States began as soon as it became clear that the Land Reform Act of June 1952 would be ap- plied to the United Fruit Company. This act called for redistribution 01 uncultivated holdings above a fixed acreage or lands of absentee owners, with compensation from twenty-year, 3 percent bonds, equal to the declared tax value of the lands. About 400,000 acres of United Fruit land fell under this law and were distributed by the Arbenz Guzman govern- ment to 180,000 peasants. This and other evidence was declared to Communist penetration of the Americas, and John Foster Dulles, m brief visit to the OAS meeting at Caracas in 1954, forced through a dec- laration condemning Guatemala. The Secretary of State left the execu- tion of this condemnation to his brother, Allen Dulles, Director 0 ' n . Central Intelligence Agency, which soon found an American-traine and American-financed Guatemalan Colonel, Carlos Castillo Armas, w was prepared to lead a revolt against Arbenz.

All civil and political freedoms were over- thrown, the land reforms were undone, and corruption reigned. When Armas was assassinated in 1957 and a moderate elected as his successor, me army annulled those elections and held new ones in which one of their own, General Miguel Ydigoras Fuentes, was \"elected.\" He liquidated What remained of Guatemala's Socialist experiments by granting these enterprises, at very reasonable prices, to his friends, while collecting his Own pay of §1,094,000 a year. Discontent from his associates led to a conservative army revolt against Ydigoras in November i960, but Amer- ican pressure secured his position. The United States at the time could n ot afford a change of regime in Guatemala, since that country was al- ready deeply involved, as the chief aggressive base for the Cuban exiles' at tack on Cuba, at the Bay of Pigs, in April 1962. As we all know, the CIA success in attacking \"Communist\" Guatemala torn dictatorial Nicaragua in 1954 was not repeated in its more elaborate attack on \"Communist\" Cuba from dictatorial Guatemala in 1962. In ac t, the Bay of Pigs must stand as the most shameful event in United States history since the end of World War II. But before we tell that story we must examine its background in Cuba's recent history, a story that well exemplifies the tragedy of Cuba. The causes of the Cuban disaster are as complex as most historical ey ents, but, if we oversimplify, we may organize them in terms of two intersecting factors: (1) the personality deficiencies of the Cubans them- selves, such as their lack of rationality and self-discipline, their emotion- alls ni and corruptibility, and (2) the ignorance and ineptitude of the American State Department, which seems incapable of dealing with La tin America in terms of the real problems of the area, but instead in- s, sts on treating it in terms of America's vision of the world, which is to a y in terms of American political preconceptions and economic interests. Cuba is more Spanish than much of Latin America, and obtained its independence from Spain only in 1898, two generations later than the test of Latin America. Then, for over thirty years, until the abrogation °t the Piatt amendment in 1934, Cuba was under American occupation (1898-1902) or the threat of direct American intervention. During that Period the island fell under American economic domination by American ! n vestments on the island and by becoming deeply involved in the Amer- J can market, especially for its sugar crop. In the same period, a local oll garchy of Cubans was built up, including an exploitative landlord 8 r °up that had not existed previously. With the establishment of the Good Neighbor Policy in 1933 and the tiding of the threat of American direct intervention, it became possible ° r the Cubans to overthrow the tyrannical and bloody rule of General ^erardo Machado which had lasted for eight years (1925-1933).

As a result, a ruthless Cuban army sergeant, Fulgencio Batista, was able to overthrow Grau San .Martin and begin a ten-year rule of the island (1934-1944) through civilian puppets, chosen in fraudulent elec- tions, and then directly as president himself. When Grau San M*rtm was elected president in 1944, he abandoned his earlier reformist ideas and became the first of a series of increasingly corrupt elected regimes over the next eieht years. The fourth such election, scheduled for io53' was prevented when Batista seized power once again, in Marcii >95 2, , The next seven years were filled by Batista's efforts to hold his posi- tion by violence and corruption against the rising tide of discontent against his rule. One of the earliest episodes in that tide was an attempt* revolt by a handful of youths, led by twenty-six-year-old Fidel Castro, in eastern Cuba on July 26, 1953. The failure of the rising of July 26th gave Castro two years of im- prisonment and more than a year of exile, but at the end of 1956 he lande with a handful of men on the coast of Cuba to begin guerrilla operations against the government. Batista's regime was so corrupt and violent tna many of the local powers of Cuba, including segments of the army an much of the middle class, were either neutral or favorable to Castro operations. The necessary arms and financial support came from the groups, although the core of the movement was made up of pcasan and workers led by young, middle-class university graduates. This Castro uprising was not typical of the revolutionary coups tna had been familiar in Cuba and throughout Latin America in an eani day, because of Castro's fanatical thirst for power, his ruthless willing' ness to destroy property or lives in order to weaken the Batista regime, and his double method of operation, from within Cuba rather than fr° abroad and from a rural base, the peasants, rather than the usual urba base, the army, used by most Latin American rebels.  ,  By destroying sugar plantations and utilities, Castro's rebels weakene the economic and communications basis of the Batista government. 1 steady attrition of the regime's popular and military support made 1 possible for Castro's forces to advance across Cuba, and, on New Year Day of 1959, he marched into Havana. Within two weeks, an additions and very ominous difference in this revolution appeared: the suppo rte of the Batista regime and dissident elements in Castro's movement bega to be executed by firing squads. For a year Castro's government carried on a reformist policy adr/U istered by his original supporters, the July 26th group of young, midd ^ class, university graduates. These reforms were aimed at satisfying t more obvious demands of the dispossessed groups who had provided t mass basis for Castro's movement.

These actions were not integrated into any viable economic program, but they did spread a sense of well-being in the Countryside, although they curtailed the building boom in the cities (es- pecially Havana), largely rooted in American investment, and they in- stl gated a flight of the rich from the island to refuge in the United States. Beneath this early and temporary bloom of well-being, many ominous S1 gns appeared. Castro soon showed that he was a tactician of revolu- •ton, not a strategist of reconstruction. He not only proclaimed perma- nent revolution in Cuba, but at once sought to export it to the rest of Latin America. Arms and guerrilla fighters were sent, and lost, in unsuc- cessful efforts to invade Panama, Nicaragua, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. Failure of these turned him to methods of more subtle pene- tration, largely worked by propaganda and the arming and training of wall subversive underground groups, especially in areas where democratic ° r progressive regimes seemed to be developing (as in Venezuela under \"etancourt or Colombia under Alberto Lleras Camargo). At the same tIr ne, an unsuccessful effort was made to persuade all Latin America to '°rm an anti-Yankee front. Although the United States, in October 1959, had promised to follow a policy of nonintervention toward Cuba, these changes within the is- ' a nd, and especially the long visit there of Soviet Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan in February i960, forced a reconsideration of this policy. The •mkoyan agreement promised Cuba petroleum, arms, and other needs *°r its sugar, although the price equivalent allowed for the sugar was only 4 cents a pound at a time when the American price was 6 cents; by June 1963, when world sugar prices reached 13 cents, the USSR raised its price for Cuban sugar to 6 cents. This trade agreement was followed by establishment of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in May and *ith Red China later in the year. The Soviet embassy in Havana became a source of Communist subversion for all of Latin America almost at ODce, while in September Khrushchev and Castro jointly dominated the a fnual session of the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York. As part of the trade agreement with Russia, Castro obtained Soviet crude petroleum for Cuban sugar. When he insisted that American- °Wned refineries in Cuba process this oil, they refused and were at once seized by Castro.

The United States retaliated by establishing a series of embargoes on Cuban exports to the United States. These controversies led Castro into an eco- nomic trap similar to that into which Nasser had fallen with Egyp ts cotton. Each nationalist revolutionary leader committed his chief foreign- exchange-earning product (sugar or cotton) to the Soviet Union as payment for Communist (often Czech) arms. This tied these countries to the Soviet Union and deprived them of the chance to use their one source of foreign money for equipment so urgently needed for economic •improvement. Bv December i960, when American diplomatic relations with Cuba were broken off, the Cuban economic decline had begun, » nci soon reached a point where standards of living were at least a third below the Batista level, except for some previously submerged groups. At the end of 1960, the Eisenhower Administration decided to use force to remove Castro. This decision was a major error and led to a totally shameful fiasco. The error apparently arose in the Central In- telligence Agency and was based on a complete misjudgment of die apparent ease with which that agency had overthrown the Arbenz re- gime in Guatemala in 1954 by organizing a raid of exiles, armed and financed bv the CIA, into Guatemala from Nicaragua. The CIA analyzed this apparently successful coup quite incorrectly, since it assumed tna Arbenz had been overthrown by the raiding exiles, when he had real'V been destroyed by his own army, which used the raid as an excuse and occasion to get rid of him. But on this mistaken basis, the CIA in i9°° decided to get rid of Castro by a similar raid of Cuban exiles from Guate- mala. This decision was worse than a crime; it was stupid. A unilateral, viO\" lent attack on a neighboring state with which we were not at war, 1 an area where we were committed to multilateral and peaceful procedure for settling disputes, was a repudiation of all our idealistic talk abou the rights of small nations and our devotion to peaceful procedures tna we had been pontificating around the world since 1914. It was a violatioi of our commitment to nonintervention in the Americas and specificai Ji in Cuba. In sequence to our CIA intervention in Guatemala, it strengt ened the Latin American picture of the United States as indifferent Latin America's growing demand for social reform and national ind pendence and as hostile to these when they conflicted with its own dnv for wealth and power. .Moreover, the attack on Cuba was i 11-advised w a time when Castro's prestige at home was rapidly dwindling and wn*j opposition was rising to his chaotic rule throughout the island. Afl ' finally, the whole operation, patterned on Hitler's operations to subve Austria and Czechoslovakia in 1938, was bungled as Hitler could nev ^ have bungled anything. The project was very much of a Dulles brotne job, and its execution was largely in the hands of the Central InteIlig eI1 Agency, which organized the expeditionary force from Cuban ex» 1"},{"pageNumber":1150,"pageContent":"THE NEW ERA, 1957-I964  \"35  financed and armed them, and supervised their training in Guatemala and elsewhere. The plan of the invasion of Cuba seems to have been drawn on typical Hitler lines: the expeditionary force was to establish a beachhead in Cuba, set up a government on the island, be recognized by the United States as the actual government of Cuba, and ask Washington for aid to restore order in the rest of the island which it did not yet control. The Joint Chiefs of Staff approved of the plan, and President Kennedy was per- suaded to accept it, after his inauguration, because of the CIA's argument that something must be done to remove Castro before his newly acquired Soviet armaments became operational. The President was assured that J f matters were allowed to go on as they were, Castro would be strength- ened in power (which was untrue) and that the invasion would be a success because the Cuban people, led by the anti-Castro underground, Would rise against him as soon as they heard of the landing. Whatever truth there was in this last contention, the CIA handling °f the invasion made it impossible, because the CIA refused to use either the anti-Castro underground in Cuba or the Cuban refugees in the United States (except as volunteers to be targets in the invasion attempt), and kept all planning and control of the invasion in its own hands. The ex- ecutive committee of Cuban refugees in the United States, mostly rep- resentatives of the older ruling groups in Cuba, were eager to restore the ^equitable economic and social system that had existed before Castro. Thev were alienated from the most vigorous anti-Castro groups in the Cuban underground, who had no desire to turn back the clock to the Machad o-Batista era but wanted to free the social and economic reform •novement from Castro, the Communists, and the antidemocratic and totalitarian forces that had taken control of it. The CIA would not cooperate with the anti-Castro underground because it was opposed to their wish for social and economic reform, and it would not use the Miami refugee committee because it doubted either their discretion or fighting spirit. Accordingly, the CIA launched the invasion without notifying the Cuban underground and kept the refugee committee locked U P without communication for the week of the attack. Then the attack ttself was bungled, since it was aimed at an inappropriate spot, without e ' ! niinating Castro's air power, and without provision for fighting it, and With the logistics for the whole tactical operation of the invasion at an Un believable level of incompetence. As a result of these errors, the 1,500 men landed at the Bay of Pigs in southern Cuba on April 17, 1961 were destroyed in seventy-two hours o.V Castro's speedily mobilized and well-armed militia. At the same time, Castro's police destroyed any possible simultaneous rising of the under- ground by arresting thousands of suspects. To do the wrong thing is ° a d, but to do it incompetently is unforgivable. The blow to American prestige from the Bay of Pigs was almost"},{"pageNumber":1151,"pageContent":"I 136  TRAGEDY AND HOPE irretrievable. On the other hand, it greatly strengthened Castro's prestige, in Latin America more than in Cuba itself, and made it possible for him to bind the Kremlin to his cause so tightly that it could neither reduce its support nor control his policies. This in turn permitted him to survive a deepening wave of passive resistance and sabotage within Cuba itself, chiefly from the peasants. And, finally, as we shall see, this made it pos- sible for him to recapture control of the Cuban revolutionary movemen for himself and the Fidelistas from the Cuban Communists. This last point was in March, 1962, but the others began in 1961. Until the Bay of Pigs fiasco, the Soviet commitment to Castro had been considerable but not irretrievable. Soviet armaments began to arrive as earlv as July i960, and in the first year exceeded 30,000 tons valued a 50 million dollars. As payment, the Communist bloc's portion of Cubas export trade rose from 2 percent to 75 percent. Within a year of the failure at the Bay of Figs, Sino-Soviet military support for Castro dou- bled. It also changed its quality to late model antiaircraft missiles, long- range missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads, and even Sovie combat troops. By the time these changes became evident to Washing- ton in October 1962, the Soviet military buildup in Cuba had cost over 700 million dollars. Before this Soviet military buildup in Cuba reached its stage of niost rapid acceleration in Julv-October 1962, a number of significant changes occurred in Cuba itself. Two of these were the growth of Cuban re- sistance to the Castro regime and Castro's acceptance and sudden reverse of a Communist usurpation of his power within Cuba. Castro's efforts to take Cuba into the Communist bloc began almost as soon as he took Havana in January 1959. His refusal to allow post- revolutionary elections to confirm his victory, a traditional Latin Am er \" ican tactic, and his outlawing of the traditional political parties (but not the Communists, PSP, which had secretly cooperated with Batista f° r years) left him in an ideological and political vacuum. Soon the closing down of all opposition newspapers, but the continued publication of the Communist paper, Hoy, showed that only this group would fill that vac- uum. And finally the small group of Old Communists in Cuba were allowed to take over control of the administrative system and, within months, had a reasonable facsimile of the Kremlin's arrangements oper- ating from Havana. They took control of the Rebel iViilitia, especially G-2, its Intelligence branch; President Manuel Urrutia was removed for an anti-Communist speech and replaced by a fellow-traveller, Osvald° Dorticos Torrado. A struggle between the Communists and the Fidelistas of the 26th of July Movement for control of the Confederation of Cuban Labor Unions was settled by Castro himself in favor of the Communists- A chief Communist leader, Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, professor of eco- nomics at the University of Havana, led a student revolt that gave the"},{"pageNumber":1152,"pageContent":"THE NEW ERA, I957-I964  H37  Communists control of the university. All political movements were merged into the Integrated Revolutionary Organizations (ORI), whose leadership was practically identical with the Old Communist leadership. This group set up Communist-type cells in farms, factories, and govern- ment offices. Anibal Escalante, secretary of the Communist Party, be- came organizational secretary to ORI. The Military Secret Police, G-2, Was transformed into a Ministry of the Interior, based on the Kremlin's MY D, with a Communist, Ramiro Valdes, at its head. The lands that had °een distributed or seized by peasants were \"nationalized\" bv local Com- munist groups, and many of the cooperative farms that had risen from these became collective farms. In all significant governmental posts, Fi- delistas were replaced, or circumvented, by Communists. Control of the economy was taken from Major Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara and given to Professor Rodriguez, who became president of the Agrarian Reform In- stitute, and drew up the economic development plans for the years fol- lowing 1961. Thus within a few months, the ORI became a real govern- ment, making most of the significant daily decisions, and Escalante was exercising more power than Castro. The latter, still the darling of the masses, spent much of his time rousing them to frenzy with his speech- making and marching. The chief resistance to this Communization of Cuba came from the peasants, by curtailing production and bv sabotage. Smaller farmers pro- duced enough for their families but no more, in resistance to government- hxed prices and the compulsion to sell all their marketable produce to the National Institute of Agrarian Reform. Farmers refused to labor on the collective or state farms and occasionally set fire to the canebrakes °n these. A good part of the coffee crop of 1961 was lost because the Workers refused to harvest it. Similar resistance arose with the sugar and other crops. Drastic food rationing had to be established in March '962. The 1962 coffee crop was sabotaged, and coffee rationing had to De established in February 1963. Most critical was the sugar crop, source °f four-fifths of Cuba's foreign exchange. Efforts to harvest the crop With the militia, students, or city workers failed, and by 1962 the crop harvested had fallen to about half of the pre-Castro figure. At the same ti me, the ending of almost all trade ties with the United States, which had been a principal source of Cuban food, left Cuba dependent on coun- ties like the Communist bloc, which had difficulties feeding themselves. The food ration fell to % pound of meat a week per person, and 5 eggs With 2 ounces of butter a month. The food shortage was soon followed °y shortages of manufactured goods, as the exodus of technicians, lack °f spare parts, and bureaucratic confusions disorganized industrial pro- duction.

On May Day 1961, Castro had proclaimed that Cuba would be a socialist state, and, in a two-day speech on December 1-2, 1961, he had announced his own \"Marxist-Leninist\" beliefs. This ended the earlier arguments, disseminated by American Establishment circles led by The New York Times, that Castro was simply a progressive reformer. But despite h is statements, he was not in any way a convinced Communist or a con- vinced anything else, but was a power-hungry and emotionally unstable individual, filled with hatred of authority himself, and restless unless he had constant change and megalomaniac satisfactions. His tactical ski', especially in foreign affairs, is remarkable, and shows similarity to Hit- ler's. His allegiance to Communism had nothing to do with ideologic 2 conviction or devotion to the Kremlin, but arose from his recogn' non that Russia was the only Power in a position to counterbalance t» United States and was, to him, preferable to the United States both be- cause of its greater distance and because its ideological pretenses woul never allow it to permit an admitted Communist state like Cuba to tJ attacked by the United States. Thus Castro sought to get the Sovte Union more deeply committed to Cuba so that it could not disentang itself whatever Castro did but must protect him from the United States, even when he openly disregarded its advice.

On May 31st it was announced that Mos- cow would provide 600,000 tons of food in the balance of 1962 to stave off the Cuban economic collapse, and later Moscow released claims on some Cuban sugar so that it could be sold in the world market for hard currencies. Above all, the Soviet Union appeared to accept Castro's argu- ment that another American military assault on Cuba was in preparation. The United States, Castro, and Moscow all must have known that no e ffort was likely to be made to repeat the American invasion of Cuba, °ut Castro made the charge because he wanted Soviet weapons, and the Kremlin pretended to believe it for reasons that are still doubtful. It is possible that the Russians hoped that the Soviet IRB.M's in Cuba would \"dp to slow up the increasing American lead over the Soviet Union in toe missile race. It is also possible that they hoped that such missiles, once established, might be bargained away in return for a Soviet-favored solu- tlQ n to the Berlin question. The increasing American aerial patrols over Cuba, which detected the Russian missile buildup on the island, were used by Cuba and the Soviet ^nion as evidence of the approaching American attack. By September, st 'll unknown to the public, the crisis began to form, and in October it Was in full progress, with the consequences already described. The ending of the Cuban missile crisis at the end of 1962 may have °pened a new era in the world's history, but it left Latin America still floundering in the same old problems, which became more complicated ^u insoluble with each passing day. As we have said, these problems can e solved only by obtaining more constructive patterns in the proper Priority sequence. On the whole, the role of the United States in Latin nierica ' las not been such as to help either patterns or priorities, largely ecause our concern has been with what seems to be useful or better °r us rather than with what would be most helpful to them. *Tom the point of view of Latin America's real interests, basic priorities m 'ght include five things: (1) more constructive psychological patterns; (2 ) increased political stability; (3) a greatly reduced birthrate, with ni phasis on the quality rather than on the quantity of population; (4) a arge increase in the food supply and in the most fundamental needs of Unian life, such as housing; (5) increased emphasis on light industry, specially processing and semiprocessing of local raw materials; and (6) ontinued improvements in transportation and communications.

The sole consequence of the Dulles efforts to do the wrong thing along the Pakistani-Peruvian axis has been to increase what he was seeking to reduce: local political instability, increased Cominu- n 'st and Soviet influence, neutralism, and hatred of the United States. Although the Dulles period, because it was a crucial period, shows 'Host clearly the failures of American foreign policy in Latin America, the situation was the same, both before and since Dulles, with a possible brief exception in the first administration of Franklin Roosevelt. Other- wise. American policy in Latin America has been determined by Amer- lc an needs and desires and not by the problems of Latin Americans. A brief survey of these policies will show this clearly. There are four chief periods in United States policy toward Latin America in the twentieth century. The first, a period of investment and interventionism, lasted until 1933 and was basically a period of com- mercial imperialism. American money came to Latin America as invest- ments, seeking profits out of the exploitation of the area's most obvious '°cal resources, mineral or agricultural, such as copper, bananas, and P c troleum, or as markets for American goods. There was little respect for tfl e people themselves or for their way of life, and intervention by Amer- ican military and diplomatic forces was always close at hand as a pro- action for American profits and investments. The Good Neighbor Policy, announced by President Roosevelt in '933, reduced intervention while retaining investment. It was partly a Co \"sequence of the idealism and progressive nature of the New Deal lts elf, hut was equally based on the fact that the need of Latin America ' or American investment funds and for the American market, especially \"$ the depressed conditions of 1933, made it so amenable to our economic a nd commercial influence that there was little need for our use of diplo- matic intimidation or the Marines. The third and fourth stages in America's Latin American policy, ' r °m 1940 to the present, have been concerned with our efforts to in- v olv e the area in our foreign policy (not theirs), that is, in the effort to S et them as deeply involved as possible in the struggle against Hitler and Japan and, since 1947, in the struggle against the Soviet Union. Both of mese efforts have been mistakes (with the possible exception of our re- gions with Brazil and Mexico in the period following 1940) because the st ates of Latin America, however dutifully they may have lined up in tlle Hot War against Hitler or the Cold War against Soviet Russia, con- futed little more to victory in these struggles than they would have C( mtrihuted if they had not been pressured by us to line up at all. Thi s four-stage chronology of American policy toward Latin America"},{"pageNumber":1157,"pageContent":"H4 2   TRAGEDY AND HOPE ignores completely the significant change that has occurred in the history of Latin America itself during the twentieth century, chiefly in the 1950's. This is the shift in emphasis in Latin American history, especially in the history of political disturbances and governmental changes from the superficial coups d'etat that were prevalent in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to the profound economic and social upheavals that first appeared in .Mexico in 1910 and were followed in the 1950's by the revolutions in Bolivia, Cuba, and elsewhere. The failure in coincidence between the stages of the history of American policy and the stages of the history of Latin America itself is a fair measure of the irrelevance and futility of our policy. That this failure continued into the 1960's was clear in Washington's jov at the military coup that ejected the left-of- center Joao Goulart government from Brazil in April 1964, for that gov- ernment, however misdirected and incompetent, at least recognized that there were urgent social and economic problems in Brazil demanding treatment. No real recognition that such problems existed was achieved in Wash- ington until Castro's revolution in Cuba forced the realization. As a con- sequence the Alliance for Progress should be regarded as the Nortn American reaction to Castro rather than its reaction to Latin Americas real problems. This helps to explain why the achievement of the Alliance for Progress has been so limited. In its earlv announcement, bv President Kennedy during his secon month in office, the projected Alliance for Progress seemed more hope- ful than anv earlier United States reaction to Latin America's problems had been. It accepted the idea of central economic planning for t Latin American nations and the role of state intervention in investme and economic life, both of which had been rejected by the Eisenhove Administration. To these it added two other basic assumptions: that La l America be required to take steps to help itself and not merely expe c grants from the United States and, also, that social improvements, su as better housing, increased literacy, and improved social amenities, regarded as intrinsic parts of, or even prerequisites to, purely econofl expansion, and not be considered, as hitherto, to be incidental con quences of such expansion. The formal agreement for the Alliance for Progress was signed > all members of the Organization of American States except Cuba, Punta del Este, Uruguav, on August 17, 1961. Its aims and attitudes W admirable, but required implementation and organizational features were not covered in the Charter itself and have largely remained ricient since.

The latter included \"a substantial and sustained growth °f per capita incomes at a rate designed to attain, at the earliest possible date, levels of income capable of assuring self-sustaining development, and sufficient to make Latin American income levels constantly larger m relation to the levels of the more industrialized nations. ... In evaluat- ln g the degree of relative development, account will be taken not only °r average levels of real income and gross product per capita, but also °f indices of infant mortality, illiteracy, and per capita daily caloric in- take.\" The minimum desirable rate of economic growth was stated to \"£ 2.5 percent per capita per year. It was, perhaps unrealisticallv, stated that economic progress should be made \"available to all citizens of all economic and social groups through a more equitable distribution of na- tional income, raising more rapidly the income and standard of living °' the needier sectors of the population, at the same time that a higher proportion of the national product is devoted to investment.\" This aim to redistribute income and achieve simultaneously higher consumption Mid higher investment is, of course, impossible except in the most ad- duced industrial societies that have already reached such levels of con- sumption of material goods that further increases in consumption in- crease problems rather than solve them. To add to this rather confused 'dea of the process of economic development, the Charter immediately added, \"Special attention should be given to the establishment and de- v elopment of capital-goods industries.\" Other desirable goals listed in the Charter included \"replacing lati- 'Undia and dw^arf-holdings by an equitable system of land tenure,\" \"to Maintain stable price levels, avoiding inflation or deflation and the conse- quent social hardships and maldistribution of resources,\" \"to strengthen fisting agreements on economic integration,\" and \"to develop coopera- te programs designed to prevent the harmful effects of excessive fiuc- Ua tions in the foreign exchange earnings derived from exports of primary products. . . .\" Among the social goals were \"to eliminate adult illiteracy and by 1970 to assure, as a minimum, access to six vears of primary education for each school age child in Latin America,\" \"to increase life e *pectancv at birth by a minimum of five years, and to increase the"},{"pageNumber":1159,"pageContent":"1144  TRAGEDY AND HOPE ability to learn and produce, by improving individual and public health ... to provide adequate potable water supply and drainage to not less than 70 percent of the urban and 50 percent of the rural population; to reduce the mortality rate of children less than five years of age to at least one-half of the present rate; to control the more serious transmittible diseases, according to their importance as a cause of sickness and death . . . ,\" and so on. The methods of achieving these desirable goals were only incidental!) established in the Charter. The participating Latin American countries were required to formulate, within eighteen months, long-term develop- ment programs that would include improved human resources through education and training, a reform of tax structures (including adequate taxation of large incomes and real estate), laws to encourage investnien both foreign and domestic, and improved methods of distribution to provide more competitive markets. The drawing of such programs in areas that lacked adequate statistical information and had few trains economists was a considerable obstacle to carrying out the Charter, an only a handful of programs were approved in the first three years of tfl Alliance. As part of the Charter the United States offered \"to provide assistance under the Alliance\" amounting to S20 billion, of which half was to come from the government and half from private sources, over a ten- year period. Nothing was said in the Charter as to the nature of this as- sistance, but the government's share has been generally in the form 0 credits, the least helpful type of such foreign assistance, and the amoun of such assistance has not, as might appear at first glance, amounted y $2 billion a year in new moneys, since private American investments i' Latin America already amounted to many hundreds of millions a year and aid from the United States government was almost equally large, so that the total of additional assistance promised by the Alliance ^' aS roughly about two-thirds of a billion dollars or less each year. It would be possible to state the achievement of the Alliance f° r Progress in terms of hundreds of thousands of housing units, schools, new hospitals, roads, additional drinking water, and experimental 01 demonstration farms, but such lists, however large the numbers, indicate little about the success of the Alliance. On the whole, it cannot be sai that the Alliance has failed; but, even more emphatically, it cannot he said that it has been a success. Its achievement has been ameliorative rather than structural, and this alone indicates that it has not been a suc- cess. For unless there are structural reforms in Latin American society, its economic development will not become self-sustaining or even manag to keep up with the growth of population on the basis of income p cl capita. The failure of the Alliance for Progress to achieve what it was touts"},{"pageNumber":1160,"pageContent":"THE NEW ERA, I 95 7-I 964  I 145 to achieve has many causes, but the chief is undoubtedly that it was not intended primarily to be a method for achieving a better life for Latin Americans but was intended to be a means of implementing American policy in the Cold War. This became clearly evident at the second Punta del Este Conference of January 22-31, 1962, where Washington's exclu- sive control over the granting of funds for the Alliance was used as a club to force the Latin American states to exclude Cuba from the Organiza- tion of American States. The original plan was to cut off Cuba's trade With all Western Hemisphere countries and to break off diplomatic relations as well. A two-thirds vote by countries was needed to make the recommendations official; it was obtained only by the minimum niargin (14 votes out of the 21 members) and only after the most intense American \"diplomatic\" pressure and bribery involving the granting and withholding of American aid to the Alliance. Even at that, six coun- tries, representing 75 percent of Latin America's area and 70 percent of 'ts population, refused to vote for the American motions. These six were Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, and Ecuador. Much of the weakness of the Alliance for Progress arises from its fail- ure to work for structural reforms that will change the patterns of Latin American life in more constructive directions. The aid, as we have said, ls entirely under the control of the L T nited States; it generally takes the torrn, not of money which can be used to buy the best goods in the cheapest market, but as credits which can be used only in the United States. Much of these credits goes either to fill gaps in the budgets or the foreign-exchange balances of Latin American countries, which pro- v ides a maximum of leverage in getting these governments to follow America's lead in world affairs but provides little or no benefit to the im- poverished peoples of the hemisphere. Moreover, the grants, which Provide dollars to these countries, are often counterbalanced by contrary influences, such as increased tariffs or other restrictions on the flow of Latin American goods to the United States, or decreases in the prices °t Latin American primary products, or (what leads to the same results) •ncreases in the export prices of American industrial goods. A decrease of a cent or two in the price that the United States pays '°r coffee can wipe out all the funds that it provides for the coffee- Ptoducing countries under the Alliance for Progress. For example, from '959 to i960 the price that the United States paid for its coffee fell from an average of 39c 1 a pound to 34^ a pound. This decrease of a nickel a Pound would represent a decrease in the total amount the United States Paid for coffee, from one year to the next, of more than $150 million *°r the 30 billion pounds'bought in i960. Similarly, a decrease of one c ent per pound on Chile's copper means a loss of about Si 1,000,000 a Vear. On the other hand, an increase in the prices of American television Se ts of one dollar each costs Latin American buyers about $15,000,000."},{"pageNumber":1161,"pageContent":"ll 46  TRAGEDY AND HOPE When both occur together, so that the prices of what Latin America sells are falling while the prices that it has to pay for American goods are increasing, as has been generally true during recent years, it means that most of the funds that Washington extends to Latin America under the Alliance for Progress are evaporating before they can be used, in terms of the total amount of dollars available for Latin American purchases of goods and equipment needed to modernize the Latin American pt°' duction system. There are many other aspects of this situation that help to explain the weak achievement of the Alliance for Progress. The tax-reform projects designed to force the rich to pay a fair share of taxes and to encourage them to invest rather than simply to hoard their surplus funds have come to almost nothing. But the possibility that something of this nature mig\" be done has caused large volumes of funds to flee from Latin America to seek shelter abroad. It is possible that the total of such Latin Amer- ican funds hiding abroad may amount to as much as $20 billion, t\" same amount the United States promised to provide over the whole te years of the Alliance's projected life. While we have no accurate figure on these sums, an official report gives $4 billion as the amount of L atl American monev on deposit in the United States at the end of 19 61 ' All of these considerations make it clear that problems of our neign' bors in the Western Hemisphere are still rising more rapidly than tn . are being solved, a condition equally true in southern Asia, southea Asia, and the Near East. In all of these, failure to find some answers the problems that are rising can only lead to neutralism, eventual natre of the Western world, and violent explosions by disappointed peop e that achieve nothing constructive either for them or for us.

Our policies are often praised or blamed for these discordant results, but they should not be, for it could easily be argued that we were hardly aware °f what we were doing in either case, and the outcomes were the con- sequence of forces quite beyond our control. This almost certainly is correct in China, but the amazing success story that is to be seen in con- temporary Japan may well be attributed to successful American policies •n combination with the peculiar social and personality patterns of the Japanese people. The Japanese Miracle The word \"miracle\" has been applied to a number of postwar events, such as the economic upsurge in West Germany, but it is nowhere more applicable than in Japan. For Japan is the only major area outside Europe, except the United States itself, which has reached that stage in economic development which W. W. Rostow called \"takeoff.\" That is, it has reached a point in development where the process continues by its own momentum, accumulating and investing its own capital, with increasing Production of food from a constantly dwindling farm population, a shift ,r) diet from emphasis on \"energy foods\" to emphasis on \"protective mods,\" and a shift in industrial activity from products requiring unskilled labor in a low capital-to-labor ratio toward products requiring highly skilled labor in a high capital-to-labor ratio. The Soviet Union itself has n °t yet reached this point in development, so that Japan is now the only fully advanced industrial nation in Asia and has, as a consequence, taken °n characteristics that are familiar to us from Western European and American experience but are totally unknown elsewhere in Asia, Latin America, or Africa. As a consequence, Japan is, for these still backward areas, a more helpful model of economic development than either the \"nited States or Western Europe, since these two earlier examples of development did not have to face some of the problems, such as lack of resources and heavy population pressure on the land, which Japan was a °le to overcome. Thus a Peace Corps of missionaries for development te ehniques would be more helpful from Japan than the present American ^eace Corps of recently graduated college students, on the ground of te chnical experience if not on the ground of humanitarian motivation. The key to the Japanese \"takeoff\" rests, as it must, on the relation- Sni p between population growth and food supply. Japan, whose population growth from 44 million in 1900 to 93 million lri i960 once made it a prime example of an \"overpopulated\" country, now has the demographic pattern of a Western industrial society. It has °ne of the world's lowest birth and death rates and a life expectancy of sixty-five years for males and seventy for females, with an increasing"},{"pageNumber":1163,"pageContent":"' 14^  TRAGEDY AND HOPE percentage of older persons. The birthrate and death rate per 1,000 were both cut in half from 1946 to 1961, the former from 34.6 to 16.9 and the latter from 15.3 to 7.4. By 1963 Japan had the lowest death rate in the world (about 7 per 1,000). As a result of these factors, the popula- tion increase of Japan, which was once over 1,700,000 a year, is now about 900,000 yearly and in 1959 fell to 780,000. It is expected that Japan's population may reach a peak of about 107 million by 1990 and then begin to decrease, falling below 100 million again by 2010. This changing population picture in Japan owes nothing to the American military occupation and rests, very largely, on the strong self-disciplined, \"inscrutable\" Japanese character. Of this we know very little. There have been a number of studies of the Japanese pet\" sonality, the best known of which, by Ruth Benedict and Geoffrey Gorer, are based on no real personal knowledge and on impressionistic evidence. The truth is that the Japanese personality seems to have a' 1 \"achieving\" pattern, but at present we know very little about it. At an} rate, the Japanese solution of their population explosion rests very largely on aspects of their personality structure. Abortion plays a much greater role in their population control than would be acceptable to many persons in our Western culture. Unlike their population control, the recent Japanese success in p r °\" ducing food owes a great deal to the American occupation. T nlS Japanese agrarian reform is one of the remarkable economic transforma- tions of this centurv. With 650 persons per square mile, compared to 50 in the Unite\" States and 25 in the Soviet Union, Japan has only two-tenths of an acre of arable land per person, and most farms are merely gardens of l esS than two acres. By 1940 about 70 percent of Japanese farmers were paying rent for land and almost 30 percent were landless. Rents weie high, and agrarian discontent became one of the chief pressures behm Japanese aggression in the 1930's. At that time, the land was extensive^ exploited in the Asiatic fashion, by applying larger amounts of hafl labor to it. .Much of it was terraced; more than half of it was irrigated, there was intensive application of fertilizers, including human waste, and the chief emphasis was on energy-yielding food, mostly rice. The reorganization of Japanese agriculture was largely due to tn American Military Occupation (SCAP), and was so successful tha the index of agricultural production increased 40 percent in the decad 1951-1961. This revolution rested on two supports: the agrarian re* form and technological advances. The agrarian reform redistributed the ownership of land by tn government taking all individual land holdings beyond 7.5 acres, a rented land over 2.5 acres, and the land of absentee owners. J 1 former holders were paid for these lands with long-term bonds."},{"pageNumber":1164,"pageContent":"THE NEW ERA, I 95 7-I 964  I 149 turn, peasants without land or with less than the maximum permitted amount of 7.5 acres were allowed to buv land from the state on a long-term, low-interest-rate basis. Cash rents for land were also lowered. As a result of this program, Japan became a land of peasant owners, with about 90 percent of the cultivated soil worked by its owners. The peasants were helped in making the transfer because the early period of the Occupation was one of food shortages, inflation, and an active black market with high prices. These profits also helped finance the beginnings of the new revolution in agricultural technology. This drastic change in farming methods in Japan was toward the American method of farm development, using less and less hand labor and greater amounts of capital, especially in farm machinery and fer- tilizers. Today all kinds of power and mechanical equipment, such as threshers, pumps, lifts, sprayers, and such, are common in Japan. Most spectacular has been the spreading of hand tractors or power culti- vators of 3 to 7 horsepower, something like American rototillers. These have increased from 7,000 in use in 1947 to 85,000 in 1955, and to almost a million by 1962. These can be used with special attachments as plows, cultivators, pumps, sprayers, saws, and draft vehicles, and have helped to eliminate draft farm animals and to reduce heavy human labor. Since a farmer can do as much work, especially plowing, with this piece of equipment, in one day as used to require ten days' work using animal power, he has a longer growing season, can extend the practice °f double cropping, and has much more time for other work. TM o aspects of this agricultural revolution deserve special mention. Japan, like the United States, is now shifting its diet from energy foods, \"ke rice, toward protective foods, like meat, milk, fruit, and green vegetables. And Japan, also like the United States, has now broken free from the older alternative of either high output per acre or high output per unit of labor, and has now reached the stage where both are rising together. In the ten years of this agricultural revolution (1951-1961) rice production w T ent up 30 percent, but dairy cattle increased ten times, meat products about three times, fruit production almost doubled, and the number of persons engaged in farming has fallen rapidly, by better than 10 percent, or more than 1.5 million persons, in the five years 1956-1961. As a result, the percentage of the working population engaged in farming is now about 28 percent, and has a steadily increas- ing portion of older persons and of females, as the younger males stream steadily to the city, seeking jobs in industry. Of course, this transformation in agriculture could never have oc- curred if there had not been taking place equally drastic changes in industry. These industrial changes, including a high rate of investment, rapid technological change, and excellent demand for industrial prod- ucts, provided a plentiful supply of jobs and an increased demand for"},{"pageNumber":1165,"pageContent":"\"5°  TRAGEDY AND HOPE food and other agricultural products by city dwellers. These conditions acted like a magnet to attract a growing flood of farm products and energetic young peasants to the cities. The contrast between the structure and distribution of Japan' 5 population and that of other Asiatic nations shows clearly that Jap an is no longer a backward, underdeveloped, or colonial area from any point of view. The marks of such a backward society are usually a high birthrate and death rate, a largely young, rural population, with the great majority in agriculture, and mostly illiterate. In Japan, all oi these characteristics are untrue. Birth and death rates are very low; the population is aging rapidly, is almost totally literate, has below 29 percent in agriculture, and has over 60 percent resident in areas classify as urban. Moreover, the revolution in Japanese industrial development has shifted the country out of its previous colonial orientation m economic organization and commerce. Before the war, Japan lived by exporting labor, largely unskiH e labor. It did this by importing raw materials, working them up \")' largely unskilled labor into products of light industry, chiefly textiles. and exporting these products for more raw materials and food. Today the Japanese need for imported food is decreasing and is shifting away from its previous food needs, notably rice, to foods of more protects character, such as proteins. At the same time, its raw material imports ar slowly shifting from those used in light industry, such as raw cotton, to those used in highly skilled industrial lines, such as electronics, where few other nations can compete. This inevitably means that Japan trade has been shifting from Asia and other backward areas, where exchanged cotton textiles for rice, to the United States and Europ where it exchanges cameras, radios, tape recorders, and optical sup plies for metals, manufactured goods, or materials for advanced IP dustry. Its needs for petroleum, iron ore, and other bulk raw materia are tending to shift to colonial areas, so that its petroleum now come from the Persian Gulf instead of the United States, and its iron ot comes increasingly from India. The social impact of economic changes such as these is far-reaching- The cities are growing rapidly, while many rural areas are losing popu' a tion as their peoples flock to urban areas.

Family dis- cipline has weakened, and the older Japanese morality and outlooks are now widely rejected. Marxism and existentialism vie for the al- legiance of the educated, while the less esoterically informed are satisfied with the pursuit of material success and personal pleasures. The gap between these two groups is considerable, and much of the stability, both political and social, in Japanese society today seems to \"se from the self-satisfaction of the new middle class and the eagerness °f many peasants and workers to get into that class and enjoy its bene- fits. These benefits increasingly provide a life like that in American suburbia, with television, baseball, bulldozers, picture windows, neon- \"ghted department stores, mass advertising, instant foods, and weekly slick magazines. The speed with which this has come about is almost °eyond belief. Commercial television began in Japan in 1953; five years later, 16 percent of urban houses had a set, but by 1961, 72 percent had sets; electric washing machines increased from 29 percent of urban houses in 1958 to 55 percent three years later. This salaried middle class is the key to the rapid achievement and political stability of Japan. Ambitious, hard-working, loyal, reliable, very adaptable to bureau- cratic organization, scientific training, and rationalizing processes, they are suspicious of ideologies or extremist doctrines of any kind, and l0 rm one of the world's most amazing peoples. These general attitudes have given Japan the appearance of successful adaptation to democratic political life as determined by the SCAP-im- Posed constitution of 1947. As a matter of fact, the Japanese are basically Uneasy about individualism, democracy, mass society, and the speed of their economic change, but few have much of an urge to rock the °oat, and those old enough to remember the years of tension and war * r om 1931 to 1944 have no preference for them. There are discontented groups, including the ultranationalists on the extreme Right and the v arious Socialist, Communist, and student groups on the Left. Both of these extremes, especially the former, operate in an atmosphere of con- siderable unreality. The really notable feature of Japanese political 'deology is the way in which SCAP's agrarian reform has driven Com- munism out of the rural areas and restricted it to the cities, chiefly to student groups.

The Shinto religion was separated from the state, forbidden to propagate militaristic or ultranationalist doctrines, and Emperor Hirohito was forced to issue a public statement denying that he was divine. A Japanese \"Bill of Rights\" protecting the rights of individuals and political freedoms, on a much more extensive basis than we have in the United States, was issued in 1945. The centralized police control in the Home Ministry was abolished, and police powers were curbed. A new civil code established freedom from family domination for all and equality for females. The Constitution itself, issued by SCAP in 1946, provided that a prime minister be chosen by the 467 members of the House of Repte- sentatives, who themselves were chosen by universal adult suffrage- These were elected from 118 electoral constituencies, each represented by from three to five members, although the voter could cast his ballot for only one candidate. This ensured representation for minority views and made it difficult to obtain a majority in the House without coalitions of parties. However, the parties have tended to coalesce into two wings around the conservative Liberal Democrats and the Socialist Party- Except for the period April 1947-October 1948, when the Socialists controlled the government during a period of extreme labor unrest and violence, control has been in the hands of the Liberal Democratic Party and its allied groups. These have generally won almost two-thirds of the seats in elections over the last ten years (since 1955), while the Socialists have had difficulty in obtaining one-third of the seats. The chief differences between the two parliamentary groups revolve around foreign affairs, with the Liberal Democrats committed to a pro-Western policy in strong alliance with the United States and rather isolated from Asia. The Socialist group wishes to weaken the American connection and resume Japan's traditional position as a leading Asiatic Power. The economic orientation of Japan and its booming prosperity have made the task of the Socialists a difficult one. The different views of the two parties in domestic politics are re- flected in a controversy over the Constitution. This document, in Article Nine, renounces war and forbids maintaining an army, navy, ° r air force. Despite this, in July 1950, General AlacArthur ordered forma- tion of a defense force, and the United States insisted on this at the time of the Peace Treaty with Japan, the following year. The Mutual Defense Alliance with the United States, signed in March 1954, bound Japan to maintain a defense force of 275,000 men.

However, even in 1963, when the Socialists made a desperate effort to obtain one-third of the seats (156), they fell 12 seats short of the neces- sary number. They have received little help from the Communists, whose parliamentary representatives rose to a peak of 35 seats in the dis- turbed period of 1949, but they alienated the Japanese by their addiction to violence and have elected only a handful of members since 1950 (none in October 1952, following the May Day riots of that year and only 3 in i960, increased to 5 in 1963). On the whole, Japan in the twentieth century has been an extraordi- nary country, and this characterization does not decrease with the pass- ing years. It is a bulwark of strength to the Western bloc, not because of its military power, which is insignificant, or even as an American mili- tary base in the Far East, but because it, like West Germany, is an example of the freedom and prosperity associated with being an Ameri- can \"satellite,\" in sharp contrast with the unhappy plight of the Soviet satellite states. Above all, Japan, for the neutrals and the backward areas of the world, is a living proof that it is possible to advance from backwardness and slavery to prosperity and freedom. Communist China Nothing could be more different from the experience of Japan than that of Japan's greatest neighbor, mainland China. On Taiwan, the Nationalist Government of China has combined a typical Chiang Kai- shek political despotism with an economic program, including agrarian reform, somewhat similar to Japan's, but Red China, as far as we can discern, has passed through one great crisis after another in a desperate and tyrannical effort to follow the Stalinist model of Soviet Russia's ex- perience. Like the Soviet Union, Red China may be able to organize itself into a powerful and expanding society, but the problems in China are much greater and more intractable than they were in Russia. For one thing, China's huge population has been placing heavy pres- sure on limited resources, while Russia has always been an under- populated country with enormous untapped resources capable of ex- tensive -exploitation. Under the czar, Russia produced great surpluses, especially of food, which were exported abroad. In a sense the Com- munist problem in Russia was to reestablish these surpluses (which had been destroyed in the Civil War period of 1917-1921) and divert them, along with surplus peasants, to the city to provide capital and labor for the industrialization process. In China there was no surplus food, so that the problem, from the beginning, was how to increase the production of food, not how to reestablish it and rechannel it.

In China the authority that impinged on the peasant was social rather than political; the enveloping influence of his family and clan formed the real social unit of the society, which was structured on these units and not on the individual, as in Russia or the West. Moreover, in China, the authority that impinged on the ordinary individual was not only social; it was static. Based on custom and tradi- tion rather than on law or political power, its whole tendency was to resist change. In Russia, on the other hand, the absence of such a binding social nexus, the fact that the basic social and metaphysical reality there was the individual, the fact that the state's power impinged on that individual and that that power, for centuries, had been seeking change (as it had under Peter or Catherine, under Alexander I and II), a \" these things assisted the establishment of a Communist dictatorship j° the Soviet Union. Moreover, almost constant internal migration i n Russia from its earliest days, and the constant threat and reality or war and invasion, gave Russia an ability to accept changing persona conditions. This was in the sharpest possible contrast with Chinese conditions, where the heaviest obligation on each family was to main- tain its fixed ancestral shrines, an obligation that tied the family to its traditional village. Nowhere was the contrast between Russian and Chinese conditions more emphatic than in religion and general outlook. The Chinese were pragmatic, while the Russians were dualistic, and the West was plural- istic. In both the West and in Russia, belief in personal salvation in the hereafter and the need to work or to suffer for such future reward had given the prevailing outlooks a powerful impression of \"future prefer- ence.\" Moreover, in Russia the close association of Church and State, ana the teaching of the former that the latter was an essential element m reality and that submission to the czar's authority was part of the process of future salvation, prepared the way for the future Communis system. The dualistic and messianic outlook of Russia prepared Russian minds to accept any kind of uncompromising, intolerant, and paintu authority as the only mechanism by which man could be shifted from this level of materialistic deprivation to the other level of Salvationist future reward, since man, by his own power, could not cross the meta- physical gap, the no-man's land of almost unbridgeable distance, between the two levels of Russian dualism.

China had none of this. There all reality was on the same mundane level; human activity sought to survive, that is, to retain the existing situation, by pragmatic adaptation and flexible response to shifting pressures. In China both philosophy and religion were largely ethics, and this ethics was both pragmatic and conservative. In such an environment the messianic, Salvationist, dynamic, future-oriented, state-dominated, abstract, and doctrinaire nature of Marxist-Leninism was utterly alien. Nevertheless, Marxist-Leninism came to China and took control of it This could not have occurred if the Old China had not been almost totally destroyed by the intrusion of the West, by the destruction of Chinese confidence in their way of life in the face of Western power, wealth, and ideology, and by the sixty years of turmoil and war ex- tending from the Japanese attack on China of 1894 to the final Commu- nist pacification in 1954. Of course, no people lose their culture completely, no matter how it •nay disintegrate, and many of the fragments of Chinese cultural pat- terns continue to persist. One obvious example of this is in foreign policy, where China's patterns were remote from those of the traditional sovereign states, equals in international law, found in modern Europe. The Chinese system was always very ethnocentric in that they not °nly saw themselves as the center of the world, but saw themselves as the only civilized unit in their world picture in a planetary arrange- ment in which lesser peoples encircled them and lived in increasingly dark barbarism, depending on their distance from Peking. In the tradi- tional view of China by the Chinese, there was, outside the three planetary rings of China itself (the imperial system, the provincial gentry, and the Chinese peasantry), increasingly remote peoples who were dependent upon China for cultural guidance, civilized example, and economic stimulation and were, in many cases (such as Indochina, Tibet, Mongolia, or Korea), in a tribute-paying relationship. This whole relationship, which was quite alien to Europe's idea in the nineteenth century of the balanced powers of equally sovereign states, Was, on the contrary, very similar to the modern Communist idea of satellite states. It seems likely that the Chinese, in spite of the many good reasons they had to be resentful of the Russians, were willing to be a satellite to the Russian sun until about 1955, when they became increasingly 'inpatient with Khrushchev's efforts to relax the Cold War.

Stalin wanted China weak rather than Communist, and all his actions seem to have been consistent with this aim. The Russians allowed some of the captured Japanese military equipment to go to the Communists in 1945, but this was small in amount compared to that which the Com- munists obtained by capture or purchase from the Nationalist forces, and the Soviet Union gave no military aid to the Communists during the last four years of the civil war (1945-1949). The Sino-Soviet Alliance of February 1950 was accompanied by * n economic development loan of I300 million and was followed by the arrival in China of a Soviet military mission of about 3,000 men, but all military aid was sold to China, and at high prices. These arms, which were entirely of obsolescent types, cost about two billion dollars over seven years, 1950-1957. No effort was made toward coordination of military exercises or training, in spite of the alliance of 1950; there was no coordination of air or sea defenses, and China was not brought into the Warsaw Pact. Moreover, the Soviet Union, by its exclusive control of the North Korean Army, built it up, launched it into the Korean War, and thus eventually dragged Red China into a war on which they had not been consulted and had no wish to be involved, but were compelled, in defense of their own security, to intervene. Early in 1955, the Soviet Union gave China some moderate help in starting a Chinese military industrial base, chiefly in the assemblage of light planes, tanks, and naval vessels, but the development of American and Soviet thermonuclear capacity and missiles left China even further behind. In November 1957, Mao Tse-tung took a delegation to Moscow and made a formal request for nuclear warheads, but was rebuffed. As a result, by 1958 Red China was embarked on the long and difficult task of seeking to make an atomic bomb of its own. This seemed such an impossible job that, almost at once, Mao began to issue public state- ments belittling nuclear weapons and promising that the enormous numbers of China's militia would be able to survive any nuclear at- tack. The Quemoy crisis of August-September 1958 showed how little support the Soviet Union would give Red China on that issue and showed equally how divided the two countries were and how averse the Soviet Union was to China's approach \"to the brink of war\" in the Far East. The defensive power of Red China remains very great, chiefly be- cause of its large population and the great distances in which it can maneuver, but its offensive power, except over the minor states on its borders, is small.

Even in that remote case, the Soviet Union's contribution would be limited, and its real strength would continue to be aimed at Europe, to be used there rather than in the Far East. Nonetheless, China's power in world politics does not rest on its own military strength but on the nuclear stalemate of the Soviet Union and the United States, both of whom are immensely more powerful in a strategic sense than anvone else in the Far East. Under cover of that nuclear stalemate and the high restraint of both Superpowers in the use of nuclear weapons, Red China is in a position to engage in local wars, \"national liberation movements,\" and \"anti-im- perialist\" guerrilla activities all around its own borders, except along die frontier it has with the Soviet Union itself. These guerrilla ad- ventures by Red China are correlated with domestic policy rather than with foreign policy, as the Quemoy crisis of summer 1958 was related to the \"Great Leap Forward\" of that year. In this correlation of China's domestic and foreign policies, a major r ole will be played by China's most critical problem: the population- food-production balance. This problem is probably more acute in China than in any similarly large area in the world. The Communist census of 1953 showed a Chinese population of almost 5S3 million, considerably more than had heen expected. By 1962 this figure may have reached 700 million. With a birthrate of 17 per 1,000, China's natural increase was about 2 percent, and gave the country about one-quarter of the world's total population. fWy about one-tenth of the land was arable, providing about 270 million acres, or less than an acre of cultivated land for every two Persons. There has been some small success in increasing the area of cultivated lands, but obviously the problem can be solved only by lowing up the increase in population and by increasing the yields of c rops per unit area of land. There seems to have been little success in either of these over the past decade or so. However, the centralized control of the Peking government over the Chinese people is so strong that it could probably bring the population explosion under control fairly quickly if a decision was made to do so. This would probably he achieved bv supplying every woman with a birth-control pill at the n °on meal each day, since that meal, for the majority of Chinese, is dually taken in a communal earing place where the process could be controlled as the authorities wished. The exclusive control of the state 0y er information and public opinion, and its ability to mobilize local social pressures, increase its ability to carry out this policy. This steadily growing crisis was brought abruptly to the acute stage by the \"Great Leap Forward\" in 1958, the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan. The earlier Five-Year Plan of 195 3-195 7 was"},{"pageNumber":1173,"pageContent":"1158  TRAGEDY AND HOPE based on the similar plan of the Soviet Union. It concentrated on investment in heavy industry, with little attention to consumers' goods or agriculture. About $3.5 billion a year, probably 20 percent of national income, was allotted to investment, with another 16 percent assigned to the armed forces. If we can believe China's own figures, the plan was a success, with output of coal, electricity, cement, and machine tools doubled and production of steel tripled. Total production of these commodities still left China largely unindustrialized, but by 1957 tne government controlled 70 percent of all industry, 85 percent of retail trade, and almost all banking, foreign, and wholesale trade. In the First Five-Year Plan, China was almost totally lacking ' n trained personnel, and was dependent for these, as well as for necessary equipment, on foreign sources. These could be found only within the Soviet bloc, but were not provided freely and had to be paid for, wit\" settlement of accounts and new yearly agreements on an annual basis- The severity of the Soviet's terms on aid to China were in sharp contrast to its more generous behavior toward some of China's lesser neighbors and must have had an adverse influence on China's attitude toward Moscow even from the beginning. However, the necessary help could not be obtained elsewhere, and the achievement of the First Chinese Five-Year Plan rested on this assistance. In addition to the loan of $300 million in 1950, the Soviet Union in 195 3—1956 agree to sell China $2 billion in equipment, and sent several thousand technics advisers to help build 211 major industrial projects. On this basis, the First Five-Year Plan achieved an annual rate 0 increase in production of at least 6 percent. The effort was finance very largely by accumulation of surplus agricultural commodities from China's hard-pressed peasantry md exchange of these for petroleum, machinery, and other commodities needed for the industrialization 0 China. Since these came largely from the Soviet Union and tW European Communist satellites, 80 percent of China's trade was with the Communist bloc at the end of this First Five-Year Plan. It is possible that this process could have continued, but it is e ven more likely that the faster rate of increase of population in comparison with the rise in food production may have indicated that the proces could not continue. In any case, the powers in Peking decided to something about it. Although it is not completely clear what they de- cided to do, and even less clear why they decided to do it, the conse- quence was a disaster. The \"Great Leap Forward\" of 1958 became great stumble. This was the third stage in the agrarian reorganizatio of China. The first stage in agrarian reform had been the \"elimination of Ian\"' lordism\" in 1950-1952. Previous to the Land Reform Law of J un 1950, 10 percent of families owned 53 percent of the farm land, whi"},{"pageNumber":1174,"pageContent":"THE NEW ERA, 1957-I964  U59  32 percent owned 78 percent of the land. This left over two-thirds of such families (58 percent) with only 22 percent of the land. The landlords were eliminated with great brutality in a series of spectacular public trials in which landlords were accused of every crime in the book. At least three million were executed and several times that number Were imprisoned, according to the official figures, but the total of both groups may have been much higher. The land thus obtained was dis- tributed to poor peasant families, with each obtaining about one-third °f an acre. The second stage in the agrarian reform (1955) sought to establish cooperative farming. In effect it took away from the peasants the lands they had just obtained. The argument for forming collectives was persuasive; most peasant holdings were too small to work effectively, since abundant fertilizers, new crops and methods, specialized tools, and efficient land management could not be used on the average peasant •arm of half an acre. To permit such improvements in farm practices, the peasants were forced into cooperatives. By the end of 1956, 83 percent of the peasants, or 125 million families, had joined into 750 thousand cooperatives. The third stage of agrarian reform, constituting the basic feature of the \"Great Leap Forward,\" merged the 750 thousand collective farms into about 26,000 agrarian communes of about 5,000 families each. This was a social rather than simply an agrarian revolution, since its a 'nis included the destruction of the family household and the peasant ullage. All activities of the members, including child rearing, education, entertainment, social life, the militia, and all economic and intellectual \"fe came under the control of the commune. In some areas the previous villages were destroyed and the peasants were housed in dormitories, With communal kitchens and mess halls, nurseries for the children, and separation of these children under the communes' control in isolation trom their parents at an early age. One purpose of this drastic change w as to release large numbers of women from domestic activities so tn at they could labor in fields or factories. In the first year of the Weat Leap Forward,\" 90 million peasant women were relieved of weir domestic duties and became available to work for the state. In •Hany cases, factories and craft centers were established in the com- munes to use this labor, manufacturing goods not only for the commune \"Ut for sale in the outside market. One of the chief aims of this total reorganization of rural life was *° make available, for savings and investment, surpluses of agricultural 'ncome from the rural sector of Chinese society in order to build up r he industrial sector. The regime estimated that it could reverse the Previous division of agricultural incomes, under which 70 percent was c °nsumed by the agricultural population and only 30 percent was"},{"pageNumber":1175,"pageContent":"Il6o  TRAGEDY AND HOPE available to the nonagricultural sectors of Chinese society. At the same time, it was expected that the communes would totally shatter the re- sistant social structure of Chinese society, leaving isolated individuals to face the power of the state. Finally, it was expected that these isolated individuals could be mobilized along military lines to carry out agricultural duties in squads and platoons assigned to specific fields and tasks. This last expectation, at least, was mistaken. \"The Great Leap For- ward\" did not increase agricultural output but on the contrary reduced it drastically, despite the extravagant estimates of increases in production that were issued bv officials toward the end of the first year. Officially the agricultural disasters of 195 8-196 2 were attributed to unfavorable climate conditions, including unprecedented droughts, floods, storms, a n insect pests, but the reversal of the \"Great Leap's\" plans and priorities in i960-1961 shows that the Chinese themselves recognized the organi- zational element as contributing to their farming problems. It is un- doubtedly true that adverse climate also contributed to the difficulties, and it may well be true that such climate conditions in the ninetecnti century might have resulted in far greater want and famine than di actually occur in 1958-1962, for the Communist government was no involved in corruption, self-enrichment, and calculated inefficiency a - earlier Chinese governments were, and had both greater power and greater desire to operate a fair rationing system, but the fact remains that in China, as in other Communist states, including the Sovie Union and Yugoslavia, the inability of a communized agricultural sys- tem to produce sufficient food surpluses to support a thoroughly com- munized industrial system at a high rate of expansion is now confirmed- On the other hand, the need for all these Communist regimes to p ur ' chase grain from the bulging agricultural surpluses of the Western countries, including Australia, Canada, the United States, and even Europe, confirms the fact that there is something in the Western pattern of living (but not necessarily in its economic organization) which does provide a bountiful agricultural system. The details of the Chinese agricultural fiasco are not yet clear. * would appear that the Chinese diet (in which at least three-quarters of food is carbohydrates, and statistically recorded as \"grain\" even when it may be potatoes) requires a basic survival diet of at least 2,000 calories a day, with at least 1,500 calories from \"grain.\" For a popula- tion of 700 million this requires a minimum crop of 180 million metric tons of \"grain\" a year, a figure that leaves nothing for reserves or f° r the inevitable inefficiencies of maldistribution through the inadequate Chinese transportation system. .Moreover, this crop must increase each year to provide for the annual population increase of 2 percent (which gave 14 million more mouths in 1962)."},{"pageNumber":1176,"pageContent":"THE NEW ERA, 1957-1964  Il6l  The official estimates for the 1958 grain crop were originally set at over 300 million tons, but in 1959 and later, this was revised to less than 250 million tons. It was probably less than 200 million. The crop for 1959 was even less (perhaps 190 million tons), while that for i960 may have been 150 million tons. These three adverse vears undoubtedly used up all China's grain reserves, and the Chinese purchases of grain in the world's markets, beginning with about 10 million tons in 1961, may have been to rebuild some reserves rather than to provide a mini- mal increase for the average hungry Chinaman. It seems clear that the average diet\" of urban Chinese over these three harsh years may have •alien as low as 1,400 calories a day, at least 600 below the level that permits steady effective work. The impact of the Chinese food crisis of 1958-1962 extended into all aspects of Chinese life and policy, including foreign affairs. This process was intensified from the fact that the \"Great Leap Forward,\" rr om the beginning, involved much more than the reorganization of China's agriculture. It also included a considerable decentralization of economic management of China as a whole, from centralized technical experts to local party and working leaders; there was a considerable increase in the influence of the Communist Party in contrast to the st ate bureaucracy, and there was the general shift from emphasis on heavy industrial investment to more short-range economic objectives. It seems likely that there was also a change in economic accounting rr om emphasis on output to emphasis on the profits accumulation of individual enterprises. Some of these changes were undoubtedly steps in the right direction, out they were lost to view under the general failure of agricultural pro- duction in 195 8-1961. This failure reacted on industrial production by curtailing both investment and labor, so that output from this sector of the economy may have fallen by half. At the same time, China's re- duced ability to export raw materials and agricultural products (simply because they could not be spared) and the need to make bulk pur- chases of food, especially grain, in Australia, Canada, or elsewhere, brought China face to face with a great shortage of foreign exchange an d made it almost impossible for China to purchase necessary equip- ment abroad. China received little help from the Soviet Union during these difficult years. The repayment of loans to Russia continued and w as, if anything, speeded up in spite of the terrible burden they placed °n the Chinese economy. Soviet imports from China were 793 million rubles in 1958 and 990 million in 1959, but fell to 496 million in 1961; Soviet exports to China, which were 859 million rubles in 1959, were down to 331 million in 1961. As a result, Sino-Soviet trade as a whole bad a total balance favorable to China (in the sense that China received more than it gave to Russia) of 984 million rubles over six years,"},{"pageNumber":1177,"pageContent":"Il62  TRAGEDY AND HOPE 1950-1955, but had a total balance unfavorable to China of —75° million rubles over six years, 1956-1961. The Soviet Union advanced no development credits to China in these difficult years (as it was doing to Mongolia, North Korea, and North Vietnam at the time), but collected payment on China's debts to it exactly as if no Chinese food crisis were occurring. The Soviet Union exported 6.8 million tons of grain to other countries in i960 and 7.5 million tons in 1961, but none to China. On the contrary, China's debt obligations made it necessary for it to ship over $250 million in agricultural exports to Russia in 1960 at the same time that it was paying out over $300 million of hard-earned foreign exchange for grain from Western countries. The Soviet attitude was: Business is business; an agreement is an agreement; and the eco- nomic development of the Soviet Union itself cannot be sacrificed for the sake of a heretical member of the Communist bloc. In 1961 the Soviet Union made some minor concessions to China's difficulties, in- cluding release of 500,000 tons of Cuban sugar to China from the total due to Russia, to be repaid in sugar later, and the sale of 300,000 tons or Soviet grain to China (only about 5 percent of China's foreign grain pu f \" chases that year). The withdrawal of almost all Soviet technical and mili- tary advisers in China during the summer of i960 could not be defended solely on the basis of \"good business practice,\" and marked one of the major steps on the continued deterioration of Sino-Soviet relations- It also established the almost complete dependence of China on its oWfl resources, supplemented by whatever it could get wherever it couiu get it, for building up its economic system. As one symbol of tna changed situation, it might be noted that trade with the Communis bloc had, at its peak, accounted for over 80 percent of China's tota foreign trade, but by 1962 it had fallen below 50 percent. The food crisis in Red China is, apparently, chronic, as it is, to a lesser degree, in all Communist countries. For example, in May 19 62 ' not a year in which the crisis was generally acute, 70,000 hungO Chinese pushed across the barricaded border of China into the booming British colony of Hong Kong during the month.

From the simple fact of balance of power, the one political event the Soviet Union had to fear Was the appearance of a new Superpower adjacent to the Soviet Union on the land mass of Eurasia. The only possibilities for such a develop- ment would be a unified western Europe or a powerful China, with India as a much more remote and unlikely possibility. In the second place, Communist China's needs for technical and eco- nomic assistance were inevitably so great that they directly compete With the Soviet Union's need for its own resources for its own develop- ment. Whatever China obtained of this nature from Russia could hardly fail, in the long run, to become a source of bitter feelings. In the third place, from the beginning, a fissure between the two Was inevitable, because, to the Soviet Union, Europe was the primary area of concern, while to China the Far East was primary. Each Power •nevitably felt that the other should support it in its primary area and ea se off pressures in the area of its own primary concern, an assumption about as unrealistic as any could be. Thus Red China resented the Soviet Union's attempts to work up crises over Berlin as deeply as Moscow resented Peking's efforts to work up crises over Taiwan. As We shall see in a moment, China's aggressive foreign policy in the Far *-ast extended far beyond Taiwan, to all of the border areas that had °nce been tributary to Peking. A fourth source of discord arose from the fact that the two Commu- ni st Powers were at quite different stages on the road to Socialism. The basic question in the allotment of economic resources in any state ls concerned with the division of such resources among the three Se ctors of (1) governmental, especially defense; (2) investment in Capital equipment; and (3) consumers' goods for rising standards of lv mg. In Stalin's day the Soviet Union placed major emphasis on (1) ? n d (2) at the expense of (3), but under Khrushchev there have been lr »creasing pressures to shift the allotment of resources toward (3). Ke d China, which is at least forty years behind the Soviet Union in tn e development process, must emphasize the first two sectors, and Ca n obtain the resources to do this only from curtailed consumption. Inus it must look at its problems from a point of view much closer 0 Stalin than to Khrushchev, a difference that led to alienation when Khrushchev began to attack Stalinism in 1956. Closely related to this fourth source of friction was a fifth, the Monolithic quality of the Marxist-Leninist states. By i960 the Soviet Anion's experiences in Europe, especially with Yugoslavia, Hungary, ari d Poland, clearly demonstrated that Communist states had their indi- 'dual characteristics and rhythms of development and could not all be ru led from one center.

At first Peking wanted the monolithic solidarity for which it yearned to be operated from Moscow after discussion by all Communist states, but bv i960 it was clear that if a Communist monolith were to be created it would have to be done by Peking itself. A sixth source of alienation between Moscow and Peking is rather du- ficult to document but may well be more important than the others. » is concerned with a growing recognition, by China if not b\\ r the Soviet Union, that the Kremlin was being driven, under a multitude of pr cs ' sures, toward a policy of peaceful co-existence with the United States, not as a temporary tactical maneuver (which would have been acceptable to China) but as a semipermanent policy. Part of this policy involve* the Soviet attitude toward die fundamental theories of Marxist-Leninism- especiallv on the Leninist side. These theories had envisioned the ad- vanced capitalist states as approaching a condition of economic collap sc from \"the internal contraditions of capitalism itself.\" According to the theory, this crisis would be reflected in two aspects: the continued 11\"\" poverishment of the working class in advanced industrial countries, W**\" consequent growth of the violence of the class struggle in such countries and increasing violence of the imperialist aggressions of such countrie toward each other in struggles to control more backward areas as marke • for the industrial products that the continued impoverishment of thei own workers made impossible to sell in the domestic market. The false\" ness of these theories was fully evident in the rising standards of liviflp of the advanced industrial countries, and especially in the ones, such a West Germany or the United States, which were most capitalistic 1 their orientation; it was also evident in the willingness of Britain, tn United States, and others to see the end of colonialism in Asia and Africa- This evidence of the errors of Marxist-Leninist theories was increas ingly clear to the Kremlin, although it could not be admitted, but it * a quite unclear to Peking, whose leaders were almost totally ignorant 0 the conditions of the non-Communist world. None of the chief Chines leaders had any firsthand knowledge of the outside world and, indee ' had in most cases never been outside China at all, except for a coup of quick visits to the Soviet Union late in life. As a consequence, th Chinese Communist leaders were ignorant, dogmatic, doctrinaire, an rigid. These attitudes appeared clearly within China in the fading of r11 \"Hundred Flowers Campaign\" of 1957.

In 1956, however, Mao Tse-tung announced a new policy of free criticism of the regime: as lie said, \"Let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend.\" This was a period of ideolog- ical confusion in the world Communist movement, which looked back () n the struggle in the Kremlin to establish Stalin's successor, was still reeling from Khrushchev's anti-Stalin speech at the Twentieth Party Congress, and late in 1956 was called upon to face revolts against the Kremlin in Budapest and Warsaw. Although Chou En-lai, the foreign minister of Red China, rushed to Europe to extend his country's support t0 Khrushchev in this power struggle, ideological confusion was every- where within the Communist world, and Mao was undoubtedly con- cerned about the solid basis for his own power and the problem of es- tablishing a rule of succession in Peking. In February 1957, Mao gave a speech to a large conference on the subject of \"The Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People.\" *t was not published until June, but in the interval gave rise to the \"Hun- dred Flowers\" controversy. In his speech Mao invited criticism and free discussion within the structure of the existing Communist state system. \"e promised immunity to the critics, so long as their criticism contrib- uted to the unity of Red China. These restrictive phrases were widely •gnored and, in a few weeks, widespread and often fundamental criticisms °f the regime were being voiced in meetings, the press, and especially 1,1 educational institutions. Three evils that Mao had mentioned—\"bu- reaucracy, dogmatism, and sectarianism\"—were being freely denounced, With the Communist Party cadres the chief targets. Some critics sug- gested that the proper solution to these problems was to permit the es- tablishment of a legal opposition party within some kind of parliamentary system. The general consensus of the complaints was aimed at the lack °f freedom to speak out, to move about, to disagree, or to publish. On June 8th the government's counterattack began, at first relatively Moderately but with increasing insistence. The principle of free crit- lc isrri was not revoked, but the publication of Mao's February speech on June 17th set the limits that had presumably always been in effect. Within a year there had been a considerable shake-up of party and state Personnel, many discontented persons (revealed by their criticism) had been removed or disciplined in various ways, and \"all Rightists had been e 'iminated.\" The chief punishment was public denunciation and personal Cl \"iticism of these discontented, but undoubtedly punishment, in many eases, went much further than that. One sequel to the \"Hundred Flowers\" criticism was a reorganization °f the upper ranks of the party and government and the provision of a succession to Mao. •Mao Tse-tung, son of a peasant who became wealthy on speculation ar »d moneylending, was born in 1893 in Hunan Province. His father, a"},{"pageNumber":1181,"pageContent":"\"66  TRAGEDY AND HOPE domestic tyrant and local miser, had less than four acres, but used the labor of his three sons and a hired hand to work them. He gave his sons a basic education, but his personal despotism drove his whole family i nt0 alliance against him. Young Mao's early life thus was one of severe dis- cipline, constant domestic strife, and secret dreams of rebellion. By p aV * ing for a substitute worker in his own stead on the family land, he was able to get away to study for five years in Hunan Normal School (fin* ished 1918). There he read deeply in Chinese history, especially military history, and formed a discussion group on large social questions. Becom- ing an employee of the library of Peking National University, he con- tinued his reading, discussion, and self-education, and in 1920 was one 01 the eleven original founders of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)- Until 1935, Mao's position in the CCP was that of a dissident, and he was, more than once, reprimanded and demoted, or removed from party positions. His chief difficulty was that he refused to accept the party s official view, insisted on by Russian-trained Communist leaders, that the revolution must be based on urban industrial workers, the \"real pr°\" letariat.\" Instead Mao envisioned the party as a tightly disciplined group that could be raised to power on the revolutionary activities of the gr ea mass of impoverished and discontented peasantry. Closely related to this idea were two others that were equally unorthodox: (1) the role ° rural guerrilla warfare in wearing down and ultimately defeating a \"reactionary government\" and (2) a fundamental emphasis on the dis- tinction between \"imperialist\" and \"colonial\" nations. This last P° in made it possible for Mao to regard the backward and undeveloped colonial areas as possible areas of revolutionary activity, where, as 1 China, the exploited peasants could provide the revolutionary impe tu and could defend their revolutionary achievements by guerrilla warfare- The more orthodox Communist line was that a revolution could be car- ried out only by an urban proletariat that could be found only in a advanced industrial area, and that such an industrial base was essentia to provide the modern military equipment needed to defend the revolu- tionary achievement against the counterattacks of aggressive, capit3'is countries. In a sense Mao was much closer to the realities of moder politics and to the experience of Soviet Russia itself, since it is perfectly clear that no advanced industrial nation will go Communist and that tn movement must make its advances in underdeveloped areas if it is to successful anywhere. Since the objections to Mao's position came frof the center of world Communist theory in Moscow, Mao distinguished \" e tween the Russian and the Chinese experience by calling Russia an eX ' imperialist\" country and China an \"ex-colonial country.\" In fact, ho*\" ever, they both became Communist while still backward countries, an did so as a consequence of invasion and defeat of the established gover ment in a foreign war. Thus Mao's interpretation, while possibly err"},{"pageNumber":1182,"pageContent":"THE NEW ERA, 1957-1964  \"67  neous in its belief that the revolutionary regime comes to power by guerrilla warefare supported by discontented peasantry, may well be cor- rect, based on the Russian precedent, that Communist regimes are more likely to come to power in backward states and will survive there if they are able to use the state's despotic power to direct the utilization of economic resources toward investment to provide a high rate of eco- nomic development, as Soviet Rusisa has done. Red China, like Soviet Russia, is governed under a parallel structure of the party and the government in which successive layers of assemblies and committees build up from the local level to the central authority. Until 1959, Mao held the chairmanship at the peak of both party and government. As a first step toward establishing a succession that would not repeat the desperate intrigue and violence that had occurred in the Kremlin following Stalin's death, he resigned from the chairmanship of the republic in favor of Liu Shao-chi, but retained his position as chair- man of the Central Committee of the party. The third man in the system, Chou En-lai, is a member of the seven-man Standing Committee that controls the party, has been premier of the government since 1949, and Was also foreign minister in 1949-195 8. While the structure of the governmental system of Red China is very similar to that of Soviet Russia, its spirit seems quite different. This is reflected in two ways. In Russia the Old Bolsheviks of the early days of the party were all eliminated, mostly by violent death, in the internecine power struggles which went on behind the grim walls of the Kremlin, while the Politburo throughout maintained a monolithic, impassive face to the outside world. In Red China most of the party leaders of today are still those who came together to engage in the earliest revolutionary struggles of the party in the 1920's. Moreover, they have, over the past forty years, often differed and even engaged in violent struggles and con- troversies with each other, but always were able to continue to work to- gether, and to patch up their differences. The real distinction here is that the Kremlin has always insisted on presenting to the outside world a pic- ture of itself as united and infallible. This is why Khrushchev's speech at the Twentieth Party Congress, attacking Stalin, was such a shock to the World. But the Chinese party leadership has never hesitated to admit that it has often been divided and fallible. Even Mao has changed his ] deas and admitted his errors. Moreover, this, apparently, can be done without any need to punish or to liquidate the fallible comrades. The key to this rather significant difference in the tone of Communist government in Moscow and Peking may be found in two basic distinc- tions: a difference of outlook and a difference of procedure. In Russia the ancient doctrinaire and rigidly ideologistic tone associated with the traditional Russian outlook and the traditional Russian religious system, both going back to their roots in Greek rationalism and Zoroastrian re-"},{"pageNumber":1183,"pageContent":"Il68  TRAGEDY AND HOPE ligion, established patterns of ideology that have continued under ma- terialistic and atheistic Communism. Such attitudes are foreign to the tra- ditions of Chinese pragmatism. Moreover, the origins of Chinese Communist organization in discussion groups in which all those present recognized their own ignorance and the inadequacy of their information on social facts, as well as on .Marxist dogma, has continued in the practice of almost endless partv meetings on all levels, filled with discussion, de- bate, and individual examination of one's own position and attitudes. As one remarkable consequence of these differences between China and the Soviet Union, there are at least half a dozen legal, minor political parties in Red China today. These not only exist and are permitted to participate in the governing process in a very minor way, but they are subject to no real efforts at forcible suppression, although they are subject to per- sistent, rather gentle, efforts at conversion. Such efforts would, of course, change to ruthless reprisal, if these tamed minor parties made any rea effort to change or destroy the position of the Communist Party itself- These differences between Communism in China and the Soviet Union may be explained most readily in terms of the different traditions of the two countries. The same applies to their different foreign policies, to which we have already referred. The foreign policy of Red China has a number of diverse aims that hold quite distinct status on any list of Chinese priorities. Naturally, l\" first place is to avoid any foreign-policy action that might jeopardize the Communist regime in China. In second place is the desire to restore the traditional international position of old imperial China as a self- sufficient, isolated giant surrounded by subordinate tributary states; ' n this case the tribute consists of ideological loyalty to the Chinese Com- munist position. In third place is the Chinese desire to restore a unified ideological bloc on a world-wide basis supporting the true (Chinese) version of Marxist-Leninism. This version is not completely orthodox in traditional Marxist-Leninist terms, since it expects Communist regimes to rise in backward and ex-colonial countries rather than in advanced industrial countries, and expects these events to be precipitated and car- ried through by discontented peasants under intellectual leaders rathef than by the industrial proletariat. On the other hand, this version is cer- tainly closer to the facts of present-day politics, and on many points, such as the inevitability of revolution, the necessary imperialist aggression ot advanced capitalist states, and the role of war as the midwife of Com- munism, is closer to Leninism than the ideas actually held in the Kremlin- The argument as to which version of Communist ideology, the Chi- nese or the Russian, is closer to Marxist-Leninist orthodoxy is singularly unrewarding, since both sides claim the advantage here, and the ideology itself, however interpreted, is so remote from the facts of economic- social development in advanced countries that no real virtue can exist in"},{"pageNumber":1184,"pageContent":"THE NEW ERA, I 95 7-I 964  I 169 being orthodox. The chief fact is that the Chinese version is potentially a much greater source of trouble to the outside world than Khrushchev's ideas of peaceful competition and noninevitable war. The Chinese version •s dangerous simply because it threatens the West in an area where it is particularly vulnerable and where it has shown no great competence, that is, among the underdeveloped nations. However, Chinese aggression in the period since 1954 has not been based on this third priority in its foreign-policy schedule but on its sec- ond priority, which seeks to create a belt of satellite subordinate states around the Chinese borders. The year 1954 may be taken as the initial date in this effort, because at that time the Peking government published a map of China that showed the Chinese border pushed deeply into Tibet, India, and southeast Asia. As early as the end of 1949, the Red Chinese had commenced a moderate intervention in Vietnam, but their most successful effort to restore the traditional Chinese satellite system Sifts in Tibet. China's suzerainty in Tibet has been generally recognized by the out- side world, even in the years when China was rent by civil wars and banditrv. Bv the treaty of May 23, 1957, Tibet itself accepted this status without recognizing that the status of \"suzerainty\" could become one °f direct subordination, under Chinese pressure. This pressure began at once, and reached an acute stage in March 1959, when the Chinese authorities sought to arrest the Dalai Lama, head of the theocratic Tibetan government. The anti-Chinese revolt that resulted was crushed in two weeks, and the Dalai Lama fled to India. During this period Chinese pressure continued into southeastern Asia, to Burma, which desperately tried to maintain a neutralist course, and especially in the successor states of former Indochina. The subsequent division of Vietnam, the struggle for Laos, and the valiant efforts of Cambodia to follow Burma's path to neutralism have already been men- tioned. For years, guerrilla operations in South Vietnam and Laos have permitted an increased Chinese intervention in the area and have made increasing demands on American wealth and power to oppose it. No solution to the problem of southeast Asia can be based on the be- lief that its troubles arise wholly, or even largely, from Communism or from Chinese aggression. For centuries, the central portion of the Malay- sian peninsula, consisting of Laos and Cambodia along the Mekong River, has been under pressure from the Thai peoples to the west and the Viet- namese to the east. From at least the seventeenth century, the area we regard as Laos was divided into three or more petty kingdoms that were Unable to unite in resistance to their more imperialist neighbors. The French hegemony in all of Indochina, from the nineteenth century to the Japanese invasion in 1942, suspended this process, but it would have been resumed in any case with the collapse of the French colonial sys-"},{"pageNumber":1185,"pageContent":"'17°  TRAGEDY AND HOPE tem there in 1954. So too, the southward movement of the Chinese, at- tracted by the rich rice lands of the Malayan river deltas, would have oc- curred in any case, even if Communism had never been invented. The Communist issue simply added another, very acute, issue to a comply situation. As we have seen, French expenditure of $7 billion and about 100,000 lives during an eight-vear struggle ended at Geneva in 1954. The Geneva agreements opened the way to a succession of troubles in Laos by recog- nizing the Leftist Pathet Lao as the government of two provinces, and recommending that it be admitted to a coalition government after a proved cease-fire and free elections. The most vital clause provided that all foreign militarv forces, except a French training group, be withdraw'! 1 from Laos. An International Control Commission representing India* Poland, and Canada was to supervise these provisions. These agreements settled nothing. The elections of December '955 brought the premiership to Prince Souvanna Phouma; he was a neutralis and brother of Souphannouvong, a Communist fellow traveler ano founder of Pathet Lao. The two brothers brought Pathet Lao into the government, but it did not give up its military bases in the two provinces it dominated. The withdrawal of other miltary forces greatly increased the potential power of Pathet Lao. When the latter showed increased strength in subsequent elections in May 1958, the anti-Communist group combined in August to oust Souvanna Phouma and put in as premier the pro-Western Phoui Sananikone. This government in turn was ejecte and replaced by a Right-wing military junta led by General Phourn Nosavan in January i960; but within seven months a new coup, tnl time from the Left, and led by Kong Le, changed the regime and brougn Souvanna Phouma back to office. Four months later, in December 19 60 ' Nosavan once again replaced Phouma by militarv force. The Communis countries refused to recognize this change, continued to recognize Sou- vanna Phouma, and increased their supplies to the guerrilla Pathet W by Soviet airlift. In March 1961, England and France, acting throng the SEATO conference in Bangkok, vetoed any direct American ° SEATO intervention in Laos. At the suggestion of Soviet Russia, the Geneva Conference was t assembled in 1962 and drew up two complicated agreements whose Cfl» consequence was to revive the agreements of 1954 within a more neutra ized frame: coalition government, elimination of all foreign miUW forces, neutrality, and a reactivation of the International Control Con mission. The resulting troika coalition of Leftists, Neutrals, and Rig nt | s served to paralyze the country, while the Pathet Lao guerrillas, using Communist North Vietman as a base, threatened to secure control of f whole country.

The growing success of these attacks over t"},{"pageNumber":1186,"pageContent":"THE NEW ERA, 1957-1964  I 171 next few years greatly agitated Washington, where officials generally felt that the fall of Laos, because of its central position, might well lead to a succession of Communist take-overs, in Cambodia, South Vietnam, Thailand, and Burma, leaving India wide open to a Red Chinese intrusion directly across these collaborating areas into the Indian plains. Some substance was lent to this fear from the fact that Red China spent the )' e ars 195 5-195 8 constructing a number of military roads that linked Smkiang to Tibet, with offshoots southward toward the Malay Peninsula. This fear became intensified in 1962-1964 as a consequence of the Com- munist take-over in Burma, the American fiascoes in Vietnam, and the direct Chinese attack on India. The strange thing about Burma was that the increase in Communist power was brought about by the army, which was increasingly dissatis- fied by the ineffectual and corrupt government of the democratic U Nu. I he latter, who was personally sincere, idealistic, and honest, represented the Burmese desire for peace, democracv, and unity from World War II °n. By October 1958, however, his subordinates in the government had Paralyzed the government with bickering and corruption. When the rul- ln g Anti-Fascist Party split, U Nu judged it impossible to carry out the a Pproaching elections, and yielded control of the country to a care- taker military government that promised to restore unity, honesty, and adequate administration, and supervise the elections. By February i960, the military leaders judged their task to be achieved, a ud held the new elections. U Nu's section of the Anti-Fascist Party won a sweeping victory, and he returned to office. The restored premier made v aliant efforts to establish national unity, to raise the level of public spirit an d cooperation, and to placate the various groups that divided the coun- ty 1 but was no more successful in restraining partisan conflict and cor- ruption in i960-1962 than he had been in the period before October '9S8. Accordingly, in March 1962, another military coup, led by Gen- ial Ne Win, ousted U Nu, suspended the constitution, and ruled through a junta of seventeen officers. Soon an effort was made to merge all po- litical groups into a single national political party with a socialist pro- grain. The Communists were treated with increasing leniency, while leaders of democratic groups continued to languish in prison. Students ar >d other dissident groups were violently suppressed, and civil liberties ^'ere generally curtailed. Suddenlv, in February 1963, a completely s °cialist regime was established by the nationalization of most property ri ghts under increasing Communist influence. Although Burma has sought to hold a neutralist course in foreign af- ' a irs, it has been drifting toward the Red Chinese camp. Late in i960 a protracted frontier dispute between the two nations was ended by an a &reement that was generally favorable to Burma, and a few months later, ln 1961, the two countries signed an economic agreement that brought"},{"pageNumber":1187,"pageContent":"117-  TRAGEDY AND HOPE Burma a loan of $84 million and technical cooperation from China. Likfi everything in Burma, this was implemented in a lackadaisical fashion, and the Burmese economic situation has deteriorated steadily since W orW War II. Part of this has been due to increased difficulty in marketing Burma's chief exports, rice and lumber, but the chief problem has been the steadv increase in population, which has reduced the per capita in- come by about a third, although national income as a whole has increased about a seventh since independence was won in 1948. While Burma on the western edge of the Malay Peninsula thus drifted toward Communism, Vietnam on the eastern edge moved in the same direction with violent struggles. The Geneva agreement of 1954 na recognized the Communist government of North Vietnam, dividing the country at the 17th parallel, but this imaginary line across jungle terrain could not keep discontent or Communist guerrillas out of South Vietnam so long as the American-supported southern government carried on i ts tasks with corruption, favoritism, and arbitrary despotism. These grow- ing characteristics of the Vietnam government centered around the antics of the Diem family. The nominal leader of the family was President Ng° Dinh Diem, although the fanatical spirit of it was his brother's wife. Madame Nhu. The brother, Ngo Dinh Nhu, was the actual power in the government, residing in the palace, and heading up a semisecret po- litical organization that controlled all military and civil appointments. Madame Nhu's father, Tran Van Chuong, who resigned from his post as Vietnam Ambassador to the United States as a protest against the arbitrary nature of the Diem family government, summed up his daugn- ter's career as \"a very sad case of power madness.\" The same authority spoke of President Diem as \"a devoted Roman Catholic with the mind 01 a medieval inquisitor.\" On the Diem family team were three other broth- ers, including the Catholic Archbishop of Vietnam, the country's ambas- sador in London, and the political boss of central Vietnam, who had his own police force. The Diem family tyranny came to grief from its inability to keep m touch with reality and to establish some sensible conception of what was important. While the country was in its relentless struggle with the Vietcong Communist guerrillas who lurked in jungle areas, striking with- out warning at peasant villages that submitted to the established govern- ment or did not cooperate with the rebels, the Diem family was engag e ° in such pointless tasks as crushing Saigon high school agitations by secret police raids or efforts to persecute the overwhelming Buddhist majority and to extend favors to the Roman Catholics who were less than 10 per- cent of the population. When Diem became president in 1955, after the deposition of the pr°\" French Emperor Bao Dai, the country had just received 800,000 refugees from North Vietnam which the Geneva Conference of 1954 had yielded to Ho Chi Minh's Communists. The overwhelming majority of these"},{"pageNumber":1188,"pageContent":"THE NEW ERA, 1957-1964  I173  refugees were Roman Catholics, and their arrival raised the Catholic population of South Vietnam to over a million in a total population of about 14 million. Nevertheless, President Diem made these Catholics the chief basis of his power, chiefly by recruiting the refugees into various police forces dominated by the Diem family. By 1955 these were already beginning to persecute the Buddhist majority, at first by harassing their religious festivals and parades but later with brutal assaults on their meet- ings. An attempted coup d'etat by army units which attacked the Royal Palace in November i960 was crushed. From that date on, the Diem rule became increasingly arbitrarv. In the middle of all this disturbance, American aid tried to revive the country's economy, and American military assistance tried to curtail the depredations of the Communist guerrillas. The two together amounted to about $200 million a year, although economic aid alone was originally twice this figure. The intensity of the guerrilla attacks steadily increased, following President Diem's reelection, with 88 percent of the vote, in April 1961. As these attacks slowly increased, the American intervention Was also stepped up, and gradually began to shift from a purely advisory and training role to increasingly direct participation in the conflict. From '9<5i onward, American casualties averaged about one dead a week, year after year. The Communist guerrilla casualties were reported to be about 500 per week, but this did not seem to diminish their total numbers or relax their attacks, even in periods when their casualties were heavy. These guerrilla attacks consisted of rather purposeless destruction of peasant homes and villages, apparently designed to convince the natives °f the impotence of the government and the advisability of cooperating With the rebels. To stop these depredations, the government undertook e gigantic task of organizing the peasants into \"agrovilles,\" or \"strategic hamlets,\" which were to be strongly defended residential centers en- firely enclosed behind barricades. The process, it was said, would also im- prove the economic and social welfare of the people to give them a greater incentive to resist the rebels. There was considerable doubt about the effectiveness of the reform aspect of this process and some doubt about the defense possibilities of the scheme as a whole. The American a dvisers preferred stalking-patrols to seek out the guerrillas rather than st atic defenses, stressed the need for night rather than only daytime coun- teractions, and the use of the rifle instead of large-scale reliance on air power and artillery. Moreover, most observers felt that very little of America's economic aid ever reached the village level but, instead, was '°st on much higher levels, beginning with the royal palace itself. By the summer of 1963, guerrillas were staging successful attacks on the stra- ngle hamlets, and the need for a more active policy became acute. Un- fortunately, just at that time, the domestic crisis in Vietnam also was becoming acute. This final crisis in the story of the Diem family and its henchmen arose"},{"pageNumber":1189,"pageContent":"I 174  TRAGEDY AND HOPE from religious persecution of the Buddhists under the guise of maintaining political order. Restrictions on Buddhist ceremonies led to Buddhist pro- tests, and these in turn led to violent police action. The Buddhists struck back in a typically Asiatic fashion, which because it was Asiatic proved to be very effective in the Asiatic context: individuals or small groups of Buddhists committed suicide in some crowded public place near a governmental center. The favorite mode of suicide was to drench the victim's long yellow robes with gasoline and ignite these with a match as he knelt in a public square or street. The calloused reaction of the Diem family, especially of .Madame Nhu, shocked the world, and out- raged feeling rose rapidlv in the summer of 1963. When thirty-five uni- versity professors and a number of public officials (including the father of .Madame Nhu) resigned, the police attacked Buddhist shrines, arrest- ing hundreds of their priests. Student agitations led to the closing of Saigon University and of all public and private schools, with the arrest of many students. A United Nations fact-finding commission was iso- lated by Diem police. On November 1, 1963, an American-encourage J military coup, led by General Duong Van Minh, overthrew the Diem family, killing several of its members. A new government, with a Buddhist premier, calmed down the domestic crisis, but by 1964 showed itself no more able to suppress guerrilla activities than its predecessor hao been. The Red Chinese intervention in southeast Asia, except perhaps m Burma, was generally indirect and through intermediaries. Elsewhere m southern and eastern Asia, this was not true. But in all areas, from 19 60 onward, it was evident that the increase in Chinese influence was not so much at the expense of the United States as it was at the expense of the Soviet Union. In North Vietnam and Burma, the Chinese influence was direct before i960, but after that date it grew stronger in Laos, South Vietnam, and Siam, while Cambodia vainly sought to obtain a guarantee of its neutrality from all concerned. In North Korea the change w= lS dramatic, since the dominant Soviet influence there was replaced by open Chinese influence in 1961. A similar process could be observed in south- ern Asia, especially in Pakistan, and even in India. The Chinese invasion and crushing of Tibet in March 1959 revealef that they had constructed a military road from Sinkiang to Lhasa. 1 lie Dalai Lama, in exile in India, accused the Chinese of genocide, and it seemed clear that a third of a million Chinese had moved into southern Tibet after resistance was crushed. Many Tibetans were compelled to work on a 1,500-mile railroad from China to Lhasa and on a road systci\" toward the borders of India, Nepal, Sikkim, and Bhutan.

As the responsible of- ficial concerned, the minister of defense and vice-premier, Krishna Menon, a close adviser of Nehru, an open sympathizer with the Soviet Union, and a skilled and sardonic baiter of the West, was removed from power. India's appeal for aid was answered bv the United States with five million dollars' worth of weapons by November 10th, but the Soviet Union found itself in the cruel dilemma of either abandoning its long efforts to win over India or contributing to a war on its nominal ally, China.

Its chief con- cern seems to have been to secure control of the Aksai Chin area, where the territories of China, India, and the Soviet Union converge. Chinese domination of this inaccessible area and improvements of Chinese com- munications there is a threat to the Soviet Union rather than to India, *hich has generally ignored the area. The Chinese desire to hold the region may be part of a scheme to relieve Soviet pressure on the Chinese \"orders farther east, near Mongolia. In any case, the Chinese resort to war on India must have been a con- sequence of very complex motivations, and surely gave rise to com- plicated consequences. It was aimed at the Soviet Union and at the United States rather than at India, but did serve to discredit all concerned, to demonstrate the power and vigor of the new China, and to cut down drastically the Indian way (as contrasted with the Chinese way) as a model for other underdeveloped Asiatic nations. One notable consequence of the Chinese attack on India was that it served to pull Pakistan further out of the Western camp toward the Communist side of neutralism. Pakistan as a member both of CENTRO ar >d SEATO had a vital position in John Foster Dulles's line of paper Carriers surrounding the Soviet heartland, but in Pakistani eyes the con- troversy with India over Kashmir was of more immediate and more mtense appeal. The Chinese humiliation of India was received with ill— concealed pleasure in Pakistan, although the Chinese were also intruding ° n some areas claimed by Pakistan. These disputes were settled by a frontier treaty with China in May 1962, and the Muslim state showed lr >creased confidence that its claims against India over Kashmir would obtain Chinese support."},{"pageNumber":1191,"pageContent":"I 176  TRAGEDY AND HOPE During all these events the divisions between the Soviet Union and Red China became increasingly public and increasingly bitter. As usual in Communist controversies, they were enveloped in complicated ideolog- ical disputes. By 1962 the Chinese had reached the point where they were accusing Khrushchev of betraying the revolution and the whole Communist movement from a combination of increasingly bourgeois obsession with Russian standards of living and a cowardly fear of Amer- ican missile power. Thus they accused the Soviet Union of betraying international Communism in accepting \"polycentrism\" (especially in Yugoslavia) and of weakness in accepting \"peaceful co-existence\" (as in the Cuban missile crisis). Khrushchev alternated between striking back at the Chinese criticism and seeking to stifle them in order to avoid a complete ideological split of the world Communist movement. The Chi- nese were adamant, and continued to work toward such a split, seeking to win over to their side the Communist movement and Communist par- ties throughout the world, especially in the more backward countries where the Chinese experience often seemed more relevant. By 1964 the split within the Communist movement seemed unbridgeable. The Eclipse of Colonialism One of the most profound and most rapid changes of the postwar period has been the disintegration of the prewar colonial empires, be- ginning with the Dutch in the Netherlands Indies and ending with the Portuguese in Africa and elsewhere. We have no need to go into any detailed narration of the events that accompanied this process in specific areas, but the movement as a whole is of such great importance that it must be analyzed. When World War II began in 1939, a quarter of the human race, si* hundred million people, mostly with nonwhite skins, were colonial sub- jects of European states. Almost all of these, with the exception of those under Portuguese rule, won independence in the twenty years following the Japanese surrender in 1945. Except in a few areas, such as the Dutch Indies, French Indochina* and British .Malaya, which had been under Japanese occupation during the war, the anticolonial movement was not significant until a decade or more after the war's end. In many places, especially in Africa, the move- ment toward independence was of little importance until 1956. Never- theless, the war may be regarded as the trigger for the whole process, since the early defeats suffered by the Netherlands, France, and Britain,"},{"pageNumber":1192,"pageContent":"THE NEW ERA, 1957-1964  II77  especially when they were inflicted by an Asiatic people, the Japanese, gave a deadly blow to the prestige of European rulers. The war also mobilized many natives into military activities, during which they learned to use arms and were often moved to unfamiliar areas where they dis- covered that the subordination of natives to Europeans, and especially the subjection of dark-skinned peoples to whites, was not an immutable law of nature. These events also showed many native peoples that their tribal divi- sions were but local and parochial concerns and that they could, and must, learn to cooperate with other persons of different tribes, different languages, and even different religions, to face common problems that could be overcome only by cooperative efforts. In many cases, the great demand and high prices for native products during the war gave native peoples, for the first time, a realization that the contrast of European affluence and native poverty was not an eternal and unchangeable di- chotomy. Accordingly, such peoples were unwilling to accept the de- creasing demand, falling prices, and declining standards of living of the postwar period, and determined to take political action to obtain inde- pendent control of their own economic situations. Moreover, just at that time, the Communist argument that colonial impoverishment and European affluence arose from the exploitation of colonial peoples by •imperialist Powers began to spread in Asia and Africa, brought back from imperial cities like London and Paris where small groups of natives, in search of education, had come in contact with Communist propagandists. Except for this last point, these factors were closely associated with the war and its outcome. But there were other influences of a much longer duration. The acquisition of European languages that permitted Native peoples to surmount the linguistic isolation of their tribal differ- ences had begun in the nineteenth century, but by the 1950's had become a more widespread phenomenon, especially among those natives who ^ere most unwilling to fall back into tribal apathy and an inferior status. Many natives, in one way or another, had acquired a smattering or more °f European education, and with this, even when it entailed a respect and affection for European culture, they had picked up much of the basic libertarian outlook endemic in European politics. In fact, in British colonial areas, educated natives had been systematically inculcated with English theories of political resistance and self-rule which went back to Magna Carta and the Glorious Revolution. Thus the myths of English history became part of the solvent of the British imperial structure. Another factor, which had been going on for a considerable time in J 956, was the process of detribalization associated with the growth of cities and the development of commercial and craft activities that brought many diverse subjects of colonialism together in urban districts or trade Unions outside the stabilizing nexus of their previous tribal associations or"},{"pageNumber":1193,"pageContent":"\"7^   TRAGEDY AND HOPE of their peasant communities. Better educated and more energetic indi- viduals among these natives took advantage of this situation to organize groups and parties to agitate for a larger share in the political control of their own affairs and eventual independence. In spite of the pressure and even the power of these changes in the colonial situation on the side of the subject peoples, there were at least equally significant, and largely unrecognized, changes on the side of their imperial rulers. For it must be recognized that in very few cases did native peoples achieve independence as a consequence of a successful revolt by force. On the contrary, in case after case, independence was granted, after a relatively moderate agitation, by a former ruling power which showed a certain relief to be rid of its colonial burden. This in- dicates a profound change in attitudes toward colonies within the im- perialist countries. The significance of this change can hardly be denied; the real question is concerned with its causes. Before 1940 the possession of colonial territories was of little direct concern to most persons in the imperial homeland. They knew that their country had colonies and ruled over peoples quite different from them- selves, and this was regarded, rather generally, as probably a good thingi a source of pride to most citizens and probably of some material advan- tage to the country as a whole. The costs of holding colonial areas were not generally recognized and were usually felt to be minor and incidental' But in the postwar period these costs very rapidly became major and direct charges, quite unacceptable to the ordinary citizen, when the post- war period and increased anticolonial agitations required heavy taxation and compulsory military service to regain or to retain such colonial areas. Once this was recognized, the former rather vague satisfaction wp 1 colonial possessions soon disappeared, and there was a rapidly spreading conviction that colonies were not worth it. The burden of taxes and military service in remote areas was regarded as part of the war, to be ended, as completely as possible, with the war itself, not to be continued indefinitely into the postwar period. Another closely related change occurred in economic aspirations. 1 ne citizens of the European colonial Powers had survived six years of hard- ships in the war itself and, in most cases, a decade or more of cconorm hardships in the prewar depression. The war demonstrated that such eco- nomic hardships had been needless. The massive economic mobilization for the war showed clearly that there could be an equally massive post- war mobilization of resources for prosperity. The ordinary Europea' was determined to obtain the rising standards of living and welfare secur- ity that he had been denied in the depression and war, and he had H stomach to be denied these any longer in order to hold in subjection na- tive peoples who wanted independence. Thus the former beneficiary and upholders of empire, usually restricted to an upper-class minority °"},{"pageNumber":1194,"pageContent":"THE NEW ERA, 1957-1964  H79  specialized interest groups, found that these interests no longer would be supported by the majority of their own citizens. In some cases independence was achieved after a period of violence, rioting, and guerrilla warfare, although in no case did these actions, how- ever extensive, become a matching of force between the colonial area and the imperial Power. In no case could these powers be matched, since the latter was overwhelmingly larger. In most cases, a more or less token display of force bv the colonial peoples showed that they could be sub- dued onlv by an expenditure of resources and inconveniences which the ruling Power decided it did not care to make. The existence of the Soviet bloc and the appearance of the Cold War, with its almost irresistible demands for expenditures of resources, helped to tip the decision toward independence. Moreover, the opinion of the United States was favorable to independence for subject peoples in a rather doctrinaire and naive anticolonialism, rooted in the American revolutionary tradition, without regard for the very great benefits the native peoples had obtained from their European rulers. Resistance to the decolonizing process was strong only in exceptional cases, such as in the French Army and in the Portuguese ruling groups. In Portugal the despotic character of the regime made it possible for the adherents of the colonial system to sustain the policy of resistance to independence, but the role of the French Army, especially in Indochina and Algeria, was almost unique. 1 his unique quality in the Algerian crisis rested on three factors: (1) Algeria, which had been held by France since 1830, was constitutionally Part of France, and its problem was part of the domestic history of the metropolitan country, since 30 of the 626 members of the French As- sembly represented Algeria; (2) in Algeria there was a large group of European settlers (about 12 percent of the total population) who could not be turned over to an independent Arab majority, whom they had treated as inferiors for years; and (3) the French Army, after a series of defeats from 1940 to Indochina in 1954, resolved not to be defeated m Algeria and was prepared to overthrow by civil war any French cabinet that wished to grant independence to that area. Bitterness in Algeria was intensified bv many other issues, including drastic religious, economic, social, and intellectual contrasts between the European set- tlers and the Algerian majority. The latter, for example, as a result of French medical skills, had one of the world's major population explo- sions, while the settlers owned most of the land and almost all the local economic activities. The bitterness of the Algerian struggle almost exceeded belief, as the extremists on each side adopted intransigent positions and sought to elim- inate by assassination the more moderate of their own groups.

The latter body becomes a mechanism for publicly demonstrating national solidarity or for proclaiming public policy, rather than an area of conflict as it had become in the western European parliamentary system. This tendency to seek a public display of uniformity and national solidarity through political and constitutional processes was evident in Hitler's Third Reich, as it has been in other recent European authoritar- ian states, including the Soviet Union, and has also appeared in the more traditionally free governments of western Europe and the United States. The European tradition to seek a settlement of disputes or differences by force or in battle was evident in the feudal tradition, in the electoral and parliamentary systems, in the contentious (rather than investigatory) nature of English legal procedure, and in the European, and especially English, obsession with sports and athletic contests. It is part of the war- like tradition of Europe that gave it the weapons development and po- litical power to dominate the world. Such an emphasis on force as a prime factor in human life is rarer in colonial areas, especially in those where peasant traditions are strong and pastoral traditions are weak (such as India, southeast Asia, China, and much of Negro Africa). In these areas force often appeared in a ritual or symbolic way, so that the outcome of a battle was settled by the in- fliction of a single casualty, which was taken to indicate a religious or magical settlement of the dispute, making further conflict unnecessary. This reluctance to the use of force in social life in many colonial areas has raised the problem of how the areas claimed by these new nations can be defended, either against their more aggressive neighbors or against more militant tribes or groups within their own population. In man) areas, notably in Africa, the existing boundaries of the new nations have no relationship to any power structure or to any existing factual real- ities at all. As colonies these areas' boundaries reflected, to some extent, the power relationships of their imperial countries in Europe, but n°M that independence has been achieved, the boundaries reflect nothing- W many cases the existing boundary, drawn as a straight line on the map' cuts through the center of tribal areas, the only existing local politics reality. The lack of a military tradition in many ex-colonial areas makes de- fense a difficult problem, as was shown in the Indian defensive weakness during the Red Chinese attack of 1962. In many areas, natives arc eag to become soldiers, because of the salaries and benefits associated WJ the role, but they do not regard fighting as part of that role.

In most cases thev center upon the imbalance between a rapidly growing popu- lation and a limited food supplv, with the accessory problem of finding employment for such additional population in their underdeveloped economic status. Technical knowledge is limited, and large-scale illiteracy hampers the spread of such know ledge, if it exists. But in most cases it does not exist, for it must be emphasized that the technical knowledge built up in Europe and America under quite different geographic and social conditions is often not applicable to colonial areas. This Mas made brutally clear in the so-called \"ground-nut scheme\" in British East Africa 'n the early postwar period, which sought to grow peanuts over a vast acreage, using American methods of tractor cultivation; it led to dis- astrous results, with monetary losses of many hundreds of millions of dollars. Any technology must fit into the natural and social ecology of the situation. The conditions of most ex-colonial areas are so different from those of western Europe and North America that our methods should be applied only with the greatest caution. American methods in Particular are usually based on scarce and high-cost labor combined with plentiful and cheap material costs to provide labor-saving but material- wasteful methods of production requiring large savings and heavy in- vestment of capital. Almost all ex-colonial areas have an oversupply of Cheap and unskilled labor with limited material and land resources and ar e in no position to raise or utilize heavy capital investments. As a con- sequence, quite different technological organizations must be devised for these areas. The social consequences of decolonization are, in some ways, similar to those that have appeared recently in the poorer areas of Western cities. This has been called \"anomie\" (the shattering of stable social re- lationships), and arises from rapid social change rather than from de- colonization. It gives rise to isolation of individuals, destruction of es- tablished social values and of stability, personal irresponsibility, shattered family relationships, irresponsible sexual and parental relationships, crime, juvenile delinquency, a greatly increased incidence of all social diseases (including alcoholism, use of narcotics, and neuroses), and personal iso- lation, loneliness, and susceptibility to mass hysterias. The crowding of 'arge numbers of recently detribalized individuals into rapidly growing African cities has shown these consequences, as, indeed, they have been shown in many American cities, such as New York or Chicago, where recently deruralized peoples are exposed to somew hat similar conditions °f anomie. Some of the more intractable difficulties of newly decolonized areas are psychological, especially as these difficulties are hard to identify and often Provide almost insuperable obstacles to development programs, especially to those directed along Western lines. It is, for example, not usually rec- °gnized that the whole economic expansion of Western society rests"},{"pageNumber":1199,"pageContent":"I184  TRAGEDY AND HOPE upon a number of psychological attitudes that are prerequisites to the system as we have it but are not often stated explicitly. Two of these may be identified as (1) future preference and (2) infinitely expandable material demand. In a sense these are contradictory, since the former implies that Western economic man will make almost any sacrifice m the present for the sake of some hypothetical benefit in the future, while the latter implies almost insatiable material demand in the present. None- theless, both are essential features of the overwhelming Western eco- nomic system. Future preference came out of the Christian outlook of the West and especially from the Puritan tradition, which was prepared to accept al- most any kind of sacrifice and self-discipline in the temporal world fo r the sake of future eternal salvation. The process of secularization 01 Western society since the seventeenth century shifted that future benefit from eternity to this temporal world but did not othenvise disturb the pattern of future preference and self-discipline. In fact, these became the chief psychological attributes of the middle class that made the Indus- trial Revolution and the great economic expansion of the West. They made people willing to undergo long periods of sacrifice for personal training and to restrict their enjoyment of income for the sake of higher training and for capital accumulation. This made it possible to develop an advanced technology with massive shifting of economic resources from consumption to forming capital equipment. On this basis Quakers, Pur 1 \" tans, and Jews built the early railroad systems, and English Non-Con- formists combined with Scottish Presbyterians to build the early if° n industry and steam-engine factories. Other advances were based ofl these. The mass production of this new industrial system was able to con- tinue and to accelerate to the fantastic rate of the twentieth century he- cause Western man placed no limits on his ambition to create a secular' ized earthly paradise. Today the average middle-class family of suburbia has a schedule of future material demands which is limitless: a second car is essential, often followed by a third; an elaborate reconstruction 01 the basement provides a recreation room, which must be followed i\" short order by an elaborate patio with outdoor cooking equipment and a swimming pool; almost immediately comes the need for an outboard motorboat and trailer to carry it, followed by the need for a summer residence by the water and a larger boat. And so it goes, in an endless expansion of insatiable demands spurred on by skilled advertising, th e whole keeping the wheels of industry turning, and the purchasing power of the community racing around in an accelerating cycle. Without these two psvchological assumptions, the Western economy would break down or would never have started. At present, future pr el \" erence may be breaking down, and infinitely expanding material demand"},{"pageNumber":1200,"pageContent":"THE NEW ERA, 1957-1964  I185  may soon follow it in the weakening process. If so, the American econ- omy will collapse, unless it finds new psychological foundations. The connection of all this with ex-colonial areas lies in the fact that without these two attitudes it will be very difficult for underdeveloped nations to follow along the Western path of development. This does not niean that no \"achieving\" society can be constructed without these two attitudes. Not at all. Many different attitudes, in proper arrangement, might be made the basis for an \"achieving\" society, but it would prob- ably not be along the Western lines of individual initiative and private enterprise. Religious feeling or national pride or many other attitudes could become the basis for achievement and economic expansion, as they Were in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt or in medieval Europe, but such other bases for achievement would be unlikely to provide a system using private savings as its method of capital accumulation or personal ambition as its motivation for acquisition of highly developed technolog- ical training and skills, as in our economy. The ordinary African is very remote from either future preference or infinitely expandable material demands. He generally has preference for the present, and his demands are often nonmaterial and even non- economic, such as his desire for leisure or for social approval. The Afri- can has a fair recognition of the immediate past, a dominant concern for the present, and little concern for the future. Accordingly, his concep- tion of time is totally different from that of the average Western man. The latter sees the present only as a moving point of no dimension that separates the past from the future. The African sees time as a wide gamut of the present with a moderate dimensioned past and almost no future. This outlook is reflected in the structure of the Bantu languages, which do not emphasize the tense distinctions of past, present, and future, as we do, but instead emphasize categories of condition, including a basic distinction in the verb between completed and incompleted actions that places the present and the future (both concerned with unfinished actions) in the same category. We do this occasionally in English when We use the present tense in a future sense by saying, \"He is coming tomorrow,\" but this rare use of the present to indicate the future does not blur our conception of the future the way constant use of such a con- struction does in Bantu. In addition to his present preference, the Bantu has a list of priorities, in his conception of a higher standard of living, which contains many noneconomic goals. A fairly typical list of such priorities might run thus: food, sex dalliance, joking with one's friends, a bicycle, music and danc- ing, a radio, leisure to go fishing. Any list such as this, with its high priority for noneconomic and basically leisure activities, does not pro- vide the constantly expanding material demands that are the motivating force in the West's economic expansion.

These remarks about the differences in African outlooks and our own could be applied also to differences in the material bases for economic expansion, as we have already indicated. It is perfectly true that the ob- stacles we have mentioned do not applv to all Africans or to all pairs of x\\frica, but in general it can be said that most Western methods and organizations do not fit the non-Western context of the newlv inde- pendent countries and that these differ so greatly from one another, or even in some cases (such as India) within a single nation, that the direct application of Western methods to these new areas is inadvisabl e. Such Western methods might work if native peoples could acquire some or the more basic attitudes that have been the foundation of Western progress. For example, the victory of the West in World War II ^' ab attributed to our capacity for rationalization and for scientific method- These in turn rest on the most basic features of the Western outlook and traditions, on the way in which our cognitive system categorizes the world, and the value system we apply to this structure of categories- But our cognitive system is derived from our past heritage, such as oW Hebrew ethical svstem, the Christian heritage (which strangely enough made us accept the reality and the value of the temporal world at the same time that it placed our final goal, achievable through behavior 1° the world of the flesh, in the eternal world of the spirit), and the lessons of Greek rationalism with its insistence on dealing with the world m * quite artificial svstem of two-valued logic based on the principle °> identity and the law of contradiction. Non-Western peoples who do n0 rind in their own system of cognition any acceptance of the rules o identity or of contradiction do not see reality In terms of two-value logic, and must make an almost impossible effort to adopt the West natural tendency to rationalize problems. On this basis, they find it dif- ficult either to rationalize their own emotional positions and thus to control or direct them, or to rationalize (which is to isolate and analyze/ their problems and thus to seek solutions for them. Africans, for exarnp' e » unless thev have been thoroughly Westernized, do not make the sharp distinctions we do between the living and the dead, between animate an nonanimate objects, between deity and man, and many other distinction which our long submission to Greek logic have made almost inevltaD to us.

The chief effort to do this has be"},{"pageNumber":1202,"pageContent":"THE NEW ERA, 1957-1964  1187  in the form of a number of meetings of so-called \"uncommitted na- tions\" of which the chief was held at Bandung, Indonesia, in 1955, and a number of efforts to move toward some kind of Pan-African system. On the whole, however, this effort toward cooperation has been blocked by three influences: (1) the sensitivity of newly independent nations to preserve this independence intact as long as possible, even to the degree that particularist local interests and rivalries are dominant over common interests; (2) the fact that all these nations need economic aid and tech- nical assistance from the advanced countries, and are, on the whole, in competition with each other to get it; and (3) the tendency of many of the newly independent areas (such as Indonesia or Egypt) to adopt pro- Soviet attitudes in the Cold War leading to efforts by the Soviet Union to infringe upon their basically neutralist policies to persuade them to make a commitment to the Communist side in the Cold War. In many ways the problems of independence have a distinctly dif- ferent character in Africa from Asia. In Asia, as is traditional along the Pakistani-Peruvian axis, the structure of societies has been one in which § coalition of army, bureaucracv, landlords, and moneylenders have ex- ploited a great mass of peasants by extortion of taxes, rents, low wages, and high interest rates in a system of such persistence that its basic- structure goes back to the Bronze Age empires before 1000 u.c. In Africa the situation has been quite different, and has generally been m constant flux. This results from a number of influences, of which one ls that Africa has been underpopulated and has not developed the kind ( »f land monopolization that supported Asiatic despotism. The dominant Social units of African society have been kinship groups: extended fam- ilies, lineages, clans, and tribes with landownership (generally of little importance) vested in these and often with a fairly wide division between ownership and rights of usufruct. Moreover, land use in Africa has gen- erally been a fallow system, often of the \"slash-and-burn\" type, in which land is cropped for a few years and then abandoned for an extended pe- r, od to recover its fertility. Thus agriculture has been on a shifting basis, and peasant life in Africa has been almost as mobile as pastoral activities arc, without the permanent localism that is associated with rural villages '\" Eurasia. Moreover, in Africa tillage of the soil, usually by digging stick rather than by plow, has tended to be carried on by women, usually \\vives, and the relationship of the agricultural worker to any exploiter has been a matrimonial or family relationship rather than a relationship mat was basically economic, as in Eurasia's serfdom, hired laborer, or plantation slavery. AH these features of the basic relationships between men and the land ln Africa have restricted the growth of the kind of agrarian superstruc- ture associated with Asiatic despotisms, and left instead a very amorphous and fluctuating system in which no complex exploitative system could be Screwed down on the masses of the people because these people were too"},{"pageNumber":1203,"pageContent":"Il88  TRAGEDY AND HOPE free to move elsewhere. As a result of this, the kinship groups that are the chief feature of rural Africa are constantly mobile, and even today can tell how their common ancestor, a few generations back, arrived in their resi- dence from some other vague place. This mobile and transitory character of native African life has been increased by two other historical features of Africa's past: the pastoral intrusions and slave raiding. The pastoral intrusions arose from the movement into and across Africa of warlike peoples who lived from herds of cattle or horses and imposed their loose rule upon the more peaceful peasant natives. These pastoral intruders have been of two kinds. The first were Bantu cattle herders who derived their way of life from other peoples in northeastern Africa and moved generally south and southwest towa'd Natal and Angola. These include such savage fighting peoples as the Zulus or the Matabeles of Rhodesia. The second pastoral group has been made up of Arabic or at least Islamized intruders, also from northeastern Africa, who have moved, gen- erally westward across Africa, with horses. These generally followed the grasslands of the Sudan, between the desert and the tropical forest, and are found today as dominant and warlike upper classes in many areas such as northern Nigeria. Both groups of pastoral intruders brought in dis- tinctive social and cultural contributions, including new religious ideas, and have enserfed numbers of the African peasants, as groups of villages or tribes rather than as individuals. The second major force that has traditionally disrupted African lire and prevented it from developing any elaborate social hierarchies or long residence linked to specific areas has been the practice of slave raiding, which goes back to ancient Egypt, was carried on by both kinds of pa s_ toral intruders, and culminated in the devastation of much of Africa in the massive slave-trade raids of the middle nineteenth century, such as were witnessed by Dr. Livingston. The establishment of European colonial rule over Africa, chiefly after 1880, eventually abolished the slave trade and greatly reduced the influ- ence of the pastoral intruders. But this did not decrease the mobility and transistory characteristic of African life, since any increase in rural sta- bility was more than overbalanced by the extension of commerce and of craft manufactures which led to a drastic growth of towns and the shattering of many of the kinship structures such as lineages and tribes- In fact, one of the most obvious problems brought to Africa by Euro- pean influence has been the detachment of atomized individuals from th e social nexus, based on blood and marriage, that previously guided their lives and determined their systems of values and obligations. Each imperial power imposed its own patterns on the people under its colonial domination, most obviously in the introduction of its own Ian-"},{"pageNumber":1204,"pageContent":"THE NEW ERA, 1957-1964  I 189 guage. These different patterns and languages remain as dominant forces after independence is achieved, serving to link together the areas with the same colonial past and to separate those with a different colonial experi- ence. In fact, the division of Africa into separate French-speaking, English- speaking, and Portuguese-speaking areas (with all that these differences imply) is now one of the chief obstacles to the creation of any major Pan-African unity. In very general terms we might say that the British impact on its Afri- can territories was largely political, the French was cultural, the Belgian was economic, and the Portuguese was religious. The obsession of the upper classes of Britain with government and poli- tics was reflected in their colonial policies, which emphasized the intro- duction of law and order, introduced political and legal systems based on English models, and educated the minority of native peoples who obtained education in the politically dominated training provided for the English upper classes (most educated natives studied political science and law). To this day ex-British colonial areas show this pattern. The French in Africa talked of their \"mission civilisatrice,\" by which they meant, at a minimum, to offer native peoples the French language with a smattering of French culture. Many natives fell in love with this culture, and with Paris, so that when liberation came they did not, as did the British-trained natives, become obsessed with the spirit of political op- position, but rather showed a desire to continue the extension of French cultural life, especially literature, along with political independence. Today some of the best poetry written in the French language comes from Africans. The Belgians in the Congo rejected any effort to extend political or cul- tural life to their native peoples, but instead sought to provide them with skills as trained laborers and to build up a prosperous economic basis for a high native standard of living while at the same time allowing them to get no glimpse of European life, the outside world, political training, or cultural and intellectual ideas. As a result, when independence came to the Congo in i960, that vast area had one of the highest native standards of living in tropical Africa but had fewer natives who had attended a university or had even traveled abroad than any French or British ter- ritory. The Portuguese were concerned with conversion of natives to Chris- tianity and with little else, believing that their control of their-areas could be maintained best if*all other kinds of change were kept minimal. They practiced racial equality and were willing to admit to Portuguese citizen- ship any native who was individually successful in obtaining a Portu- guese education, but on the whole they did not encourage even this kind of development.

The independence of Ghana was a personal achievement of Dr. Kwamc Nkrumah, who returned to Accra from an educational process in Pennsyl- vania and the London School of Economics. The year before, in 19461 the Gold Coast obtained the first British African Legislative Assembly that was allowed a majority of Africans. Nkrumah's agitations, including the founding of a new political party, the Convention People's Party, under his own control, earned him a two-year jail sentence. While lie was still in jail, his party won 34 of the 38 seats in the Assembly in the elec- tion of 1951; therefore he was released from confinement to take control of the administration. With good will on both sides, a transition period of six years gave Ghana its independence, under Nkrumah's rule, in March ' 957 ;. Within a year of independence, Nkrumah faced the typical problems or postcolonialism that we have mentioned: a rapid fall in cocoa prices upon which Ghana's international trade position depended; disease in the cocoa trees, which required destruction of thousands of trees over the violent protests of their peasant owners; dissension between the pagan, commer- cial, coastal area, in which the Convention People's Party was based, aiw the more pastoral. Islamic, remote interior. Nkrumah soon showed his readiness to handle all problems with ruth- less decision. The \"sick\" cocoa trees were cut down; political opponents were silenced in one way or another; Nkrumah was ballyhooed as the father of all Africans, the unique genius of the African revolution, the mystic symbol of all black men's hopes. A Five-Year Plan for economic development (1959-1964) promised to spend over 92 million dollars. 1° i960 the previous British-granted constitution was replaced by a new republican constitution that was amended almost at once by a clause allowing Nkrumah to rule without parliament whenever necessary. I ' 1C leader's Pan-African hopes were reflected in a clause that permitted \"tK surrender of the whole or part of the sovereignty of Ghana\" to a union of'African states. Bv the end of the same year, political party designa- tions were abolished in Parliament, and the Preventive Detention Ac (which allowed Nkrumah to imprison his enemies without charge) was used to arrest the chief members of the political opposition. Ghana em- barked on an economic war with the Union of South Africa in protest against the latter's extreme segregation of the races and on a sonicwna weaker svstem of economic reprisals against France in retaliation for it nuclcar-e.xplosion tests in the Sahara.

Nigeria, the largest territory in the British colonial empire, larger than any European state and four times the size of the United Kingdom, with 35 million inhabitants, did not become free until i960. The delay was caused by the internal divisions within the territory. These were not unex- pected, for the territory was an artificial creation, cut out of the Afri- can wild by Lord Lugard just before World War I. It consisted of three regions—North, West, and East—which had no central assembly until 1946, and continued to have diverse interests and attitudes. Each region had a separate government with a joint federal government at Lagos. The Northern Region is Muhammadan, patriarchal, underdeveloped, poor, ignorant, and feudal, ruled bv an aristocratic upper group of emirs de- scended from pastoral conquerors. The Western Region is small but rich and thickly populated with progressive agriculturalists, chiefly Yoruba. The Eastern Region, dominated by the Ibo peoples, tends to dominate the whole federation. There are tribal and religious differences between the three, since the south is pagan, and government of the federation must be by coalition of two regions against the third. American-educated I3r. Nnamdi Azikiwe (known as \"Zik\") was the first governor-general, functioning as president and the dominant political figure from the East- ern Region, while the prime minister was Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, a Muslim from the Northern Region. The Opposition was led by Chief Qbafemi Awolowo of the Western Region. This rather precarious bal- ance of forces was stabilized bv the strength of the English-speaking tradition of moderation and rule of law, both much more securely estab- lished in Nigeria than in Ghana, and by the industrious, alert, and bal- anced character of Nigeria's chief tribal groups. The economy was also better balanced than that of many African states, with a productive agri- culture as well as varied mineral resources. The key to Africa's future may rest with the success of former French Africa, since this group seems to provide a nucleus on which the more moderate forces on the continent may congregate. The chief difficulty from which they suffer is that most are arid and all are poor (compared to the Congo or Nigeria). The impact of war was much more significant in French Africa than in British Africa, because of the defeat of France and the fact that the supporters of De Gaulle's resistance, rather than of Petain's pseudo- Fascism, controlled these territories during much of the war. Such control could be sustained only with the support of the African population, Which was loyally given, although few rewards came in return for more"},{"pageNumber":1207,"pageContent":"I192  TRAGEDY AND HOPE than a decade after the war. Then freedom came swiftly, in sequence to the military disasters in Indochina in 1954 and the rising disaster m Algeria, rather than from the events or struggles in Black Africa itself- The first effort was not toward independence but toward closer union with France, bv incorporating the African territories in an elaborate fed- eral structure, the French Union, which gave the Africans representation and even cabinet posts in Paris. One of the incidental consequences of this largely transitory structure was that the neutralism of the African end of the structure tended to spread to the metropolitan end in Paris. At the same time, American support of independence for colonial areas, at a time when Paris was seeking to strengthen its African connections, was one more in a series of American actions that drove France, a°\" especially De Gaulle, toward a neutral position for Paris itself. The French Union was still in process of being established in 1958, after having lost Indochina in 1954, Morocco and Tunis in 1956, when the Fourth French Republic disintegrated beneath the strain of the Algerian crisis, and De Gaulle came in with his constitution for the Fifth Repub- lic. This provided a federal system by which essential powers were re- served to the central authority and other powers devolved upon the \"autonomous\" member states. The key \"Community\" functions reserved to France included foreign affairs, defense, currency, common economic and financial policy, control of strategic materials, and (with certain ex- ceptions) higher education, justice, external transportation and com- munications. The new constitution was presented to the overseas areas of France with the opportunity to accept or reject it, but with little expectation that any area would reject it because of their need for French economic air and other expenditures of federal funds. Sekou Toure, of Guinea, how- ever, persuaded his area to vote against ratification and was, in retaliation by De Gaulle, instantly ejected from the French Community, and i rs political and financial support (about $20 million a year) was stopped The newly independent and outcast area sought support in Moscow, spreading panic in other capitals at this opening of the African scene to Soviet penetration. For about five years, Guinea sought an alternative to the French system, established an authoritarian one-party Leftish regime signed an act of \"union\" with Ghana (a meaningless agreement that brought Toure a S28 million loan from Nkrumah), and welcomed Soviet aid and Communist technicians to Conakry. Guinea recognized East Germany, welcomed influences from Red China, accepted American offers of counteraid, and nationalized all schools, churches, and many French-owned business enterprises.

The Guinea exodus from the French Community in 1958, regretted by both sides within a few years, opened the way to independence for all French Africa. Senegal and the Sudanese Republic, linked together briefly as the Mali Republic, obtained freedom in April i960, and started a flood of declarations of independence led by Madagascar (Malgache Republic). This political disintegration of the French areas in Africa raised at once two acute problems: (1) What would be their relationship with France, a connection that had brought French Africa over two billion dollars in French development funds in the 1947-1958 period? and (2) What arrangements could be made between the newly independent states to prevent the Balkanization of Africa, with its resulting inability to handle problems of transportation, communications, public health, river development, and such, which transcend small local areas? To answer the first question, a French constitutional law of June i960 changed the French Community to a contractual association. Fourteen French African states signed a multitude of individual agreements with France that recognized their full sovereignty on the international scene but established \"cooperation\" with France over a wide range of eco- nomic, financial, cultural, and political relationships. Thus by voluntary agreement, French control along the general lines of the existing status quo was preserved. The effort to prevent Balkanization by some sort of federal arrange- ment for the French African areas was prevented by the objections of Ivory Coast and of Gabon. The former was the wealthiest of the eight French Western African states, while Gabon was the richest of the four French Equatorial African states. This opposition broke up the Mali union of Senegal and Soudan in i960, and the latter, taking the name Mali to itself, drifted off toward cooperation with Guinea. This disin- tegration of French Africa was stopped only because of growing anxiety at the efforts of Ghana's Nkrumah to form an opposed Pan-African bloc of a Leftish tinge. This effort gave rise to the \"Union of Independent African States\" and the \"All-African Peoples' Conferences.\" The Union of Independent African States arose from the Pan-African dreams of the late George Padmore and was organized by him for Nkrumah. Its first meeting, at Accra in April 1958, had representatives of the eight states then independent in Africa (Ethiopia, Ghana, Liberia, Libya, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, and the United Arab Republic). They demanded an end to French military operations in Algeria and immediate independence for all African territories.

The All-African People's Conferences, also sponsored by Nkrumah, were great mass conventions of labor unions, youth groups, political parties, and other organizations from all Africa, including nonindependent areas. They achieved little beyond the usual denunciations of colonialism- apartheid, and the Algerian war. Three of these conferences were held at Accra, Tunis, and Conakry in 1958-1960. In opposition to these Ghana-inspired movements, in late i960, Dr. Felix Houphouet-Boigny, the political leader of Ivory Coast, one-time French cabinet minister and French spokesman at the United Nations, took steps to organize a French-centered union of African states. Called the \"Braz- zaville Twelve,\" after their second meeting at Brazzaville, French Congo, in December i960, these formed a loose organization for cooperation and parallel action in Africa, the United Nations, and the world. In the United Nations they established a bloc to vote as a unit from October i960. At the same time, they began to work closely as a group with a number of technical, economic, educational, and research organizations that had grown up under the United Nations, or with international spon- sorship to deal with African problems. Of the large number of these, we need mention onlv the Commission for Technical Cooperation in Africa South of the Sahara (head office in London) and its advisory council, the Scientific Council for Africa South of the Sahara (head office in Belgian Congo), the Foundation for Mutual Assistance in Africa South of the Sahara (office in Accra). As we have said, the Ghana-Guinea Union of May 1959 was ex- panded, with the accession of Mali in July 1961, into the pompously named Union of African States (UAS). At Brazzaville, in December i960, six French territories of West Africa and four of Equatorial Africa joined with the Cameroons Federation and the Malgache Republic to form the \"Brazzaville Twelve\" (officially entitled Union of African and .Malagasy States, or UAMS). At a conference at Casablanca in January 1961, the UAS moved a step further by forming rather tenuous links with Morocco, the United Arab Republic, and the provisional government or Algeria. Four months later, at Monrovia, the UAMS formed a more stable and homogeneous grouping of twenty, by adding to the Brazzaville group Liberia, Nigeria, Togo, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia, Somalia, Libya (which had previously been at Casablanca), and Tunisia.

The UA.MS group has eschewed these issues, has sought to avoid con- troversy and propaganda, and has played down the anti-imperialist, anti- Portuguese, anti-South African issues which rouse such enthusiasm but achieve so little in mass assemblies of Africans. The UAMS also, unlike the UAS group, has rejected any efforts to interfere in the domestic af- fairs of its African members and neighbors. Instead it has tended to work quietly on rather technical questions and lias been satisfied with moderate agreements. Its chief meetings, usually twice a year, have assembled the chiefs of the member states, with a different host city on each occasion. Agreements reached at these high level conferences are then generally implemented by subsequent meetings of specialized or technical experts. The Union's concerns have been economic and social rather than political or ideological, and its approach to its problems has been generally con- ciliatory, tolerant, empirical, relatively democratic, pro-Western, and, above all, tentative. Most of its achievements have resulted from months of careful testing of the ground and have usually been considered at sev- eral of its \"summit\" conferences. Its charter of Union, for example, was not signed until the fourth conference, at Tananarive, in September 1961. Its mechanisms of operation, beyond the semiannual meetings of chiefs of state, consists of a secretariat and secretary-general at Cotonou, Dahomey; a Defense Union consisting of a council of the twelve defense niinisters and a general staff and military secretariat at Ouagadougou, V oka; the Organization of African-Malgache Economic Cooperation stationed at Yaounde, Cameroon; an African-Malgache Union of Posts and Telecommunications consisting of the twelve ministers concerned with these and a central office at Brazzaville; a joint \"Air Afrique\" airline, associated with \"Air France\"; and other, similar, organizations concerned with development, shipping, research, and other activities. Several agree- ments have been signed establishing judicial, financial, and commercial cooperation. The whole system has an independent budget financed by a fixed percentage grant from each state's budget to the common fund. The Whole relationship has formed the chief element of stability in African problems, has retained its close contacts with France, and has formed the tore of a moderate group among the growing multitude of neutrals at the United Nations.

But there is no consensus on the direction of such change. Human beings are basically conservative, in the sense that they expect and wish to continue to jog along in the same old patterns. Accordingly, they tend to regard most changes as regrettable, although one might get the impression, in a bustling and dynamic place like the United States, that men preferred change to stability. It is perfectly true that Americans now have change built into the pat- tern of their lives, so that saving and investment and, in general, the flows of claims on wealth (what most of us call \"money\") now go in directions that make constant change almost inevitable. Summer has hardly arrived before summer dresses have been sold out, autumn clothing is beginning to arrive on the dealers' racks, and extensive plans are already in process to make next summer's clothing (which goes on sale in the southern resorts in winter) quite different. This year's cars are not yet available for sale when the manufacturers are planning changed versions for next year's \"lodcls. And urban commercial buildings are still new when plans for remodeling, or even total replacement, are already stirring in someone's mind. In such an age the sensible man can only reconcile himself to the fact: change is inevitable. But few men—average or exceptional—feel any competency in deciding the direction that change will take.

In attempting this risky procedure, we shall continued to divide so- ciety into six aspects, falling into the three major areas of the patterns of power, rewards, and outlooks. The area of power is largely, but not ex- clusively, concerned with military and political arrangements; the area °f rewards is similarly concerned with economic and social arrangements; and the area of outlooks is concerned with patterns that might be termed teligious and intellectual. Naturally, all these are different, and even dras- \"99"},{"pageNumber":1215,"pageContent":"1200  TRAGEDY AND HOPE tically different, from one society to another, and even, to a lesser extent, between countries, and areas within countries. For the sake of simplicity, we shall be concerned, in this chapter, with these patterns in Europe and the United States, although, as usual, we shall not hesitate to make com- parisons with other cultures, especially with the Soviet Union. The Unfolding of Time The political conditions of the latter half of the twentieth century will continue to be dominated by the weapons situation, for, while politics consists of much more than weapons, the nature, organization, and control of weapons is the most significant of the numerous factors that determine what happens in political life. Surely weapons will continue to be expen- sive and complex. This means that they will increasingly be the tools of professionalized, if not mercenary, forces. All of past history shows that the shift from a mass army of citizen-soldiers to a smaller army of pr°\" fessional fighters leads, in the long run, to a decline of democracy. When weapons are cheap and easy to obtain and to use, almost any man may obtain them, and the organized structure of the society, such as the state, can obtain no better weapons than the ordinary, industrious, private citi- zen. This very rare historical condition existed about 1880, but is no* only a dim memory, since the weapons obtainable by the state today are far beyond the pocketbook, understanding, or competence of the ordinary citizen. When weapons are of the \"amateur\" type of 1880, as they were 10 Greece in the fifth century B.C., they are widely possessed by citizens, power is similarly dispersed, and no minority can compel the majority to yield to its will. With such an \"amateur weapons system\" (if other con- ditions are not totally unfavorable), we are likely to find majority rule and a relatively democratic political system. But, on the contrary, when a period can be dominated by complex and expensive weapons that only a few persons can afford to possess or can learn to use, we have a situation where the minority who control such \"specialist\" weapons can dominate the majority who lack them. In such a society, sooner or later, an au- thoritarian political system that reflects the inequality in control 01 weapons will be established. At the present time, there seems to be little reason to doubt that the specialist weapons of today will continue to dominate the military picture into the foreseeable future. If so, there is little reason to doubt that authoritarian rather than democratic political regimes will dominate the"},{"pageNumber":1216,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  1201  World into the same foreseeable future. To be sure, traditions and other factors may keep democratic systems, or at least democratic forms, in many areas, such as the United States or England. To us, brought up as we were on a democratic ideology, this may seem very tragic, but a number of perhaps redeeming features in this situation may well be considered. For one, our society, Western Civilization, is almost fifteen hundred Years old, and was democratic in political action for less than two hundred of these years (or even half of that, in strict truth). A period that is not democratic in its political structure is not necessarily bad, and mav well °e one in which people can live a rich and full social or intellectual life whose value may be even more significant than a democratic political or military structure. Of equal significance is the fact that a period with a professionalized army may well be, as it was in the eighteenth century, a period of limited warfare seeking limited political aims, if for no other reason than that professionalized forces are less willing to kill and be killed for remote and total objectives. The amateur weapons of the late nineteenth century made possible the mass citizen armies that fought the American Civil War and both of this century's world wars. Such mass armies could not be offered financial rewards for risking their lives, but thev could be offered idealistic, ex- treme, and total goals that would inspire them to a willingness to die, a nd to kill: ending slavery, making a world safe for democracy, ending tyranny, spreading, or at least saving, \"the American way of life,\" offered such goals. But they led to a total warfare, seeking total victory and Unconditional surrender. As a result, each combatant country came to feel that its way of life, or at least its regime, was at stake in the conflict, and could hardly be expected to survive defeat. Thus they felt compulsion to fight yet more tenaciously. The result was ruthless wars of extermination such as World War II. With a continued professionalization of the armed services, caused by the increasing complexity of weapons, we may look forward with some assurance to less and less demand for total wars using total weapons of mass destruction to achieve unconditional surrender and unlimited croals. The rather naive American idea that war aims involve the destruction °f the enemy's regime and the imposition on the defeated people of a democratic system with a prosperous economy (such as they have never Previously known) will undoubtedly be replaced by the idea that the enemy regime must be maintained, perhaps in a modified form, so that We have some government with whom we can negotiate in order to obtain °ur more limited aims (which caused the conflict) and thus to lower the 'evel of conflict as rapidly as possible consistent with the achievement of °ur aims. The nature of such \"controlled conflict\" will be described in a foment."},{"pageNumber":1217,"pageContent":"1202   TRACED V AND HOPE The movement toward professionalization of the armed forces and the resulting lowering of the intensity of conflict is part of a much larger process deriving from the nuclear and Superpower stalemate be- tween the Soviet Union and the United States. The danger of nuclear destruction will continue and become, if anything, more horrifying, but will, for this verv reason, become a more remote and less likely prob- ability. In the late 1960's the United States will have about 1,700 vehicles (missiles and SAC planes) targeted on the Soviet bloc; by the 1970's this will rise to about 2,400. Moreover, by 1970, 650 of these will be Polaris missiles on our 41 nuclear submarines, which cannot be found and eliminated by any Soviet missile counterstrike, once they are submerged at sea. The great value of the Polaris over its land-based rivals, such as .Minuteman, is that the Soviet Union knows where the latter are and can countertargct on them. This means that the MM's must be fired out of their silos before the Soviet warheads, seeking them out to destroy them, can arrive fifteen minutes after takeoff. Such a precarious position encourages nervous anticipation and possibility of precipitate action, capa- ble of beginning a war no one really wants. Thus, on an enormously greater scale, we have something like the von Schlieffen Plan that made it necessary for Germany to attack France in 1914 when there was no real issue justifying resort to war between them. The Polaris missiles at sea, since they cannot be found and counterforced, can be delayed, with- out need to strike first or even to strike second in immediate retaliation, but can be held off for hours, days, and weeks, compelling the Soviet to negotiate even after the original Soviet strike has devastated Americas cities. Thus the Soviet Union cannot win in a nuclear exchange, even » they make the first strike. The reverse is also true. In the mid-1960's the Soviet Union has vehi- cles able to deliver up to six hundred or seven hundred nuclear warheads on the United States and perhaps seven hundred or eight hundred on our European allies. Their warheads are larger than ours (with up to 100- megaton ICBM's, while our largest are 9 MT). In spite of the fact that their missile sites are poorly organized, with missiles, fuel, crews, and warheads widely scattered, so that they are at least twelve hours from takeoff even in their fourth stage of readiness, the inaccuracy of our counterforce missiles is so great that we could not eliminate all their missiles, even if we made a first strike with no warning. It would require only about 200 Soviet warheads to devastate our cities totally, and an American strike at Soviet missile bases delivered without warning would leave almost that number not eliminated; these would be free to make a retaliatory strike at us. Aloreover, the Soviets have several dozen Polaris- type submarines that can fire four missiles each from surfaced positions. Many of these would survive an American unannounced first strike. All this means that we are as much deterred by the Soviet missile threat"},{"pageNumber":1218,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  I203  as they muse be by our much greater threat. Such deterrence has nothing to do with the relative size of the numbers of missiles possessed by two countries. It rests on whether an unannounced first strike would leave surviving enough missiles for a retaliatory strike capable of inflicting un- acceptable damage. This is now the situation on both sides, and the exis- tence of Polaris-type missiles makes it impossible to avoid this by striving for greater numbers of missiles, for larger warheads able to obliterate wide areas, or for greater accuracy that would increase the statistical possibility of eliminating enemy missiles on first strike. Thus no one will wish to make such a strike. Possibly for this reason, about a year after the Cuban missile crisis, the Soviet Union ceased to work on new missile bases and accepted its permanent inferiority to the United States. But the mutual veto on the use of missiles, the nuclear stalemate, remained. This stalemate between the two Superpowers on the use of nuclear •weapons also extended to their use of lesser, nonnuclear, weapons, so that the nuclear stalemate became a Superpower stalemate. This meant that much of the power of the Soviet Union and the United States, and not merely their nuclear power, was neutralized to a considerable degree, since each feared to use its nonnuclear powers for fear they might escalate into nuclear conflict. This meant that the use of nuclear tactical weapons and the use even of conventional tactical weapons were inhibited to an undetermined degree by the presence of nuclear strategic weapons no one wanted to see used. The costs of using nuclear tactical weapons are so great that it is very doubtful if they are worth the cost. For example, the Western Powers lack the conventional forces to stop any intrusion of the great masses of Soviet ground forces if these began to drive westward in an attempt to conquer Germany. The West is committed to oppose such an effort. Since it is very doubtful that the NATO forces could oppose this successfully by using only conventional weapons, there would be great pressure to use the nuclear tactical weapons that NATO forces in Europe possess. It has been estimated that the chief targets of such nuclear tactical weapons would be bridges and similar narrow passages, in an effort to close these to Soviet advances. But it seems clear that if these passages were closed and the bridges destroyed, the advance of the Soviet armies (in armored and mechanized divisions) would be held up only a few weeks at most, and up to 50 million Germans would be killed from the blast and side effects of the use of nuclear weapons. At such a cost, the Germans would probably prefer not to be defended. In fact, it appears increasingly likely that fewer and fewer advanced people will regard lar^c-scalc war as an effective method of getting any- thing. What could a people obtain through war that they could not obtain with greater certainty and less effort in some other way? Indeed, the very idea of winning a general war is now almost unimaginable. We do not even know what we mean l>v \"win.\" Whatever Germany, Japan,"},{"pageNumber":1219,"pageContent":"1204  TRAGEDY AND HOPE and Italy sought from World War II, they would surely not have ob- tained bv winning; vet they obtained the most significant parts of it by losing. Glory, power, and wealth may all be obtained with less effort and greater certainty bv nonwarlike methods. As science and technology ad- vance, making war more horrible, they also make it possible to achieve any aims at which war might be directed by other, nonviolent, methods. The relationships between political organizations (to us, states) are chiefly political relations, based on power and concerned with influencing the policies of other such entities. We have tended to see such relation- ships in dichotomies, especially the sharp contrast between violent and nonviolent methods of war and peace. In fact, however, methods of in- fluencing policy form a spectrum without any significant real discon- tinuities, and range from all-out nuclear warfare at the upper end, down through tactical nuclear weapons and conventional weapons, then through various levels of nonviolent political, social, and economic pressures, *° levels of peaceful persuasion and reciprocal favors, to economic grants and even gifts. When Khrushchev renounced the use of both nuclear war and con- ventional violence, and promised to defeat the West by peaceful com- petition, he was dividing the spectrum into three levels, but in fact it is a continuous spectrum with ioo-megaton bombs at the upper end and Olympic Games, International Geophysical Years, and foreign economic aid at the other end. When Khrushchev made his statement, he was con- vinced that the Soviet Union could outperform the United States on the level of peaceful competition because it could, in his opinion, overcome the American lead in the race for economic development and that, as a result, the Socialist way of life would become the model for emulation by the uncommitted nations. The failures of Socialist agricultural produc- tion in Russia, Cuba, China, and elsewhere, and the great triumphs or non-Socialist economies in Japan, Europe, and the United States, soon revealed, even to Khrushchev's supporters, that the Soviet chances or triumphing over the West by peaceful competition were very small- Conceivably this might force the Kremlin to raise its anti-American ac- tivities to a higher level of conflict, even to the level of violence, although probably through surrogates and satellites and in third-party areas (sucn as southeast Asia, Africa, or Latin America). To prevent such a raising of the level of Soviet-American conflict, i might be worth while for the West to consider the possibility of yielding the Kremlin some victories on the lower, nonviolent, levels, especially if this could be achieved at little cost to us. It might also be worth while for us to consider what must be Russia's real goals. Obviously preserva- tion of the Communist regime must have a higher level of desirability ro Moscow than Castro's success in Cuba or the Kremlin's control of Buda- pest. Thus to the Politburo, now as earlier under Stalin, continued contro"},{"pageNumber":1220,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  1205  in the Kremlin has a higher priority than world revolution. The West can help Russia's rulers get what they really want (their own domestic power), and at small cost, in return for what they can want only sec- ondarily (the expansion of Communism). Thus, like Stalin, they can be forced back to \"Socialism in one country.\" With rising domestic de- mand for higher standards of living in Russia, and growing evidence that these are more likely to be obtained under a non-Socialist or mixed economy, they could be forced back to \"non-Socialism in one country,\" if this strengthened their own control in the Kremlin, as it well might do. In fact, some such process is already under way. The Soviet Union has always been more conservative and less extremist in international mat- ters than it appeared or sounded. Much of Khrushchev's truculence, even abroad, was for domestic rather than for foreign consumption. A recent study of 29 crisis situations in foreign affairs involving the Soviet Union in the 1945-196 3 period shows that they were aggressive in only four, were cautious in eleven, and were more cautious than aggressive in four- teen. The four aggressive ones were concerned with Berlin, Hungary, the U-2 incident, and Cuba. The study showed that only 8 of the 29 crises were initiated by the Soviet Union, while 11 were initiated by the United States. The general conclusion of the study was that Soviet policy would grow increasingly conservative, since they were primarily concerned with state building and retaining what they have already achieved. The chief uncertainty of continuing this process arises from the prob- lem of political succession in the Kremlin, a major unpredictable factor. Here the chances are two out of three that the trend would continue in Soviet policy, since the one case of a successor who would reverse the more conservative policy is outbalanced by the two cases of a suc- essor who would retain it or of a disputed succession that would make an active Soviet foreign policy difficult. The fact remains that there are in the Soviet Union no institutional safeguards for any policy, just as there are none for the succession. But it is clear that pressures to continue a more moderate foreign policy will be strong, under any successor, now that the Russians are increasingly convinced that their present achievements are worth keeping, as the pressures for domestic improvements continue, and as their future hopes and expectations along these lines become more clearly envisaged. In this way the Superpower neutralization (and the included nuclear stalemate) will continue into the future. From this flow three conse- quences: 1. Movement of Soviet-Western rivalry down to lower, less violent, levels of conflict and competition. 2. Continued disintegration of the two Superblocs, from the inability Of. the chief Power in each to bring force against its allies because of the"},{"pageNumber":1221,"pageContent":"1206  TRAGEDY AND HOPE need to accept growing diversity within each bloc in order to retain as much as possible the appearance of unity within the bloc. This process is well illustrated by Moscow's difficulties with China, Albania, and now Romania, or by Washington's troubles with De Gaulle or with its Latin American allies. 3. A growing independence of the neutrals and uncommitted nations because of their ability to act freely in the troubled waters stirred up by the Soviet-American confrontation. These changes, rooted in weapon developments and technological changes, have less obvious political implications. Policy and politics are concerned with methods of influencing the behavior of others to obtain cooperation, consent or, at least, acquiescence. In our Western world, power has been based to a significant extent on force (that is, weapons), and to a lesser degree on economic rewards and ideological appeal. In other cultures, such as in Africa, politics has been based to a considerable extent on other considerations, such as kinship, social reciprocity, and religion. Changes in weapons within the Western states system have brought about changes in political patterns and organization that threaten to cause profound changes in political life and probably in the Western states svstem. For manv centuries, from the ninth century to the twentieth, the in- creasing offensive power of Western weapons systems has made it pos- sible to compel obedience over wider and wider areas and over larger numbers of peoples. Accordingly, political organizations (such as the state) have been able to rule over larger areas, and thus have become larger in size and fewer in numbers in our Western world. In this way, tne political development of Europe over the last millennium has seen thou- sands of feudal areas coalesce into hundreds of principalities, and these into scores of dynastic monarchies, and, finally, into a dozen or more national states. The national state, its size measured in hundreds of miles, was based, to a considerable extent, on the fact that the weapons system of the nineteenth centurv, founded on citizen soldiers with handguns and moved (or supplied) by railroads and wagons, could apply force over hundreds of miles. This, in manv cases, proved to be approximately tne same size as the European linguistic and cultural groupings of peoples; and, accordinglv, it became easv to base the popular appeal for allegiance to the state structure upon nationalism (that is, upon this common language and cultural tradition). Languages and cultures covering lesser areas than those that could be ruled over by the existing nineteenth-century system of weapons and transport, such as the Welsh, the Bretons, the Provencals, the Basques, Catalonians, Sicilians, Ukrainians, and others, by failing t0 become centers for one of these dominant weapons-organized structure., went into political eclipse.    ,    As the technology of weapons, transportation, communications, an"},{"pageNumber":1222,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IX PERSPECTIVE  1207  propaganda continued to develop, it became possible to compel obedience over areas measured in thousands (rather than hundreds) of miles and thus over distances greater than those occupied by existing linguistic and cultural groups. It thus became necessary to appeal for allegiance to the state on grounds wider than nationalism. This gave rise, in the 1930's and 1940's, to the idea of continental blocs and the ideololgical state (replacing the national state). Embraced bv Hitler and the Japanese, and (much less consciously) by the United States and Britain, this growing pattern of political organization and appeal to allegiance was smashed in World War II. But during that war technological developments in- creased the area over which obedience could be compelled and consent obtained. By 1950, Dulles and others talked of a two-Power world, as if consent could be obtained by only two Powers, and as if each were hemispherical in scope. They were not. For, while the area of power organizations had expanded, they had not become hemispherical, and new counterbalancing factors had appeared that threatened to reverse the whole process. Instead of power in the 1950's being concentrated in two centers, each hemispherical in scope and able to compel obedience over distances of 10,000 miles, the Superpowers could compel obedience over distances in the range of 6,000 to 8,000 miles, leaving a considerable zone be- tween them. In addition the neutralization of their real power in their Superpower confrontation made this zone between more obvious, and weakened their ability to obtain obedience to extreme demands even within 6,000 miles of their power centers (which were situated, let us say, in Omaha and Kuibyshev). In this power gap between the less than hemispherical Superpowers appeared the neutrals of the Buffer Fringe. But there was more to the situation than this geographical limitation. The nature of power was also changing, although few noticed this. The role of force in politics had been effective to the degree that it was able to influence the minds and wills of men. But the new weapons, in seeking increased range, had become weapons of mass destruction rather than instruments of persuasion. If the victims of such weapons are killed, they can neither obey nor consent. Thus the new weapons have become instruments, not of political power, but of destruction of all power organizations. This explains the growing reluctance by all concerned to use them. Furthermore their range and areas of impact make them most ineffective against individual men and especially against the minds of individual men. And, finally, in an ideological state it is the minds of n ien that must be the principal targets. Any organization is coordinated both by patttrned relationships and by ideology and morale. If the former become increasingly threatened by weapons of destruction, the organization can survive bv becoming decentralized, with less emphasis on organizational relationships and more emphasis on morale and out-"},{"pageNumber":1223,"pageContent":"1208  TRAGEDY AND HOPE look. They thus become increasingly amorphous and invulnerable to modern weapons of destruction. The peoples of Africa are, for this reason among others, not susceptible to compulsion by megaton bombs. And Western peoples or Soviet peoples can become less susceptible by becoming Africanized. This process has not gone very far yet, but it is already observable, especially among the younger generation of the United States, Europe, and the Soviet Union. To the young in all three of these areas there is a growing, if quiet, skepticism of any general abstract appeal to alle- giance and loyalty, and a growing concern with concrete, interpersonal relationships with local groups of friends and intimates. There is still another element in this complex picture. This is also related to weapons. The past history of weapons over thousands of years shows that the reason political units have grown larger in certain periods has been because of the increased power of the offensive in the dominant weapons systems, and that periods in which defensive weapons became dominant have been those in which political units remained small in area or even became smaller. The growing power of castles in the period about uoo B.C. or about A.D. 900 made political power so decentralized and made power units so small that all power became private power, and the state disappeared as a common form of political organization. Thus arose the so-called \"Dark Ages\" about 1000 B.C. or A.D. 1000. We do not expect any such extreme growth of defensive power in the future, but any increase in defensive weapon power would stop the growth in size of power areas and would, in time, reverse this tendency. There would be thus a proliferation in numbers and a decrease in size of such power units, a tendency already evident, in the past twenty years, in the great increase in the number of United Nations member states. No drastic increase in the defensive power of existing weapons can vet be demonstrated in any conclusive way, but the rising ability of guerrilla forces to maintain their functional autonomy shows definite limits on the offensive power of contemporary weapons. Any drastic increase in the ability of guerrilla forces to function would indicate such an increase in the defensive power of existing weapons, and tins, in turn, would indicate an ability to resist centralized authorities and thus an ability to maintain and defend small-group freedoms. Such a rise in the strength of defensive weapons, with a consequent decentralization of political power, would require a number of other changes, such as a decentralization of economic production. This probably seems very unlikely to us who live in the frantic economic expansion of the electronic revolution and the space race, but it is a 1 least conceivable. Such a change would require a plentiful, dispersed source of industrial energy and the use of plentiful and widely scattered materials for industrial fabrication. These do not seem to be completely"},{"pageNumber":1224,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  1209  unlikely possibilities. For example, a shift from our present use of fossil fuels as a chief energy source to the use of the sun's energy directly in many small local energy accumulators might provide a plentiful supply of decentralized energy. More remote might be use of the tides, or of differential ocean temperatures, or even of the winds. Possibly some development in the use of nuclear energy, or, above all, some method for cheap separation of the oxygen and hydrogen in ordinary water that could release energy, perhaps through fuel cells, as they recombine. Such a decentralized energy source, if developed, could be used to build up a decentralized industrial system using cellulose or silicon as raw materials to produce an economy of plastics and glass products (including fiber glass). These two raw materials found in vegetation and sand are among the most common substances in the world. On such a basis, with the proper development of guerrilla weapon tactics, the costs of enforcing centralized orders in local areas might rise so high that a considerable process of political decentralization and local autono- mies (including local liberties) could arise, thus reversing the process of political centralization that has continued in the Western tradition for about a thousand years. In this process, a significant role might be played by the appearance of a major, nonnuclear, deterrence. This already exists, but is not publicly discussed because it presents such a threat to the existing world political structure. It rests in the existence of biological and chemical weapons (BCW) that can be just as devastating as nuclear weapons and do not require a rich or elaborate industrial system for their manufacture or use. Thus they might be more readily available or usable by the less ad- vanced industrial nations, but are not being researched by such nations to any considerable degree because they might also be more effective as weapons against such backward nations. At the same time, the more advanced nations also hesitate to publicize the existence of such weapons because there is no assurance that they might not, while being readily available to backward nations, still be relatively effective against ad- vanced nations. Much of the significance of this relationship can be seen in regard to Red China. This potential enemy has already exploded some kind of a nuclear device and will have a nuclear weapon in the next few years, but this offers little potential danger to us since they will have no effec- tive longf-range delivery vehicle. On the other hand, their threat with this against our allies, such as Japan or the Philippines, or their ability even now with their mass armies to threaten our interests in India, Southeast Asia, or Korea, is potentially high. Against such a threat, our uuclear missiles are relatively weak, because China is too dispersed and decentralized to offer vital targets. On the other hand, China's vulnera- bility to the threat of biological warfare is very large. This explains"},{"pageNumber":1225,"pageContent":"I2IO  TRAGEDY AND HOPE their hysterical attacks on American \"germ warfare\" during the Korean War. The word puts them into a panic, and rightly so, since they are critically vulnerable to such weapons used by us. The virus for wheat rust and rice blast, in varieties especially virulent on Chinese-type plants, can be produced in large amounts relatively easily at costs well below $40 a pound. Spread on the fields at the proper time in the annual growing cycle, these would destroy up to 75 percent of these crops. And there is no effective defense. In consequence the Chinese food intake would be cut from about 2,200 calories per person a day, not much above the subsistence level, to about 1,300 calories a day. If the Chinese permitted this, they would have few people strong enough to work at the defense effort, either in the combat areas or in industrial plants. If they tried to keep the food intake of more indispensable defenders up by strict ra- tioning, leaving nothing for many children, old people, and women, they would suffer about 50 million deaths from malnutrition within a year. The armed forces, still largely of peasant origin, would not allow a rationing svstem that doomed their families in the villages, and would turn against the regime, especially if an American offer to feed the Chinese on American surplus food after a Chinese surrender were broad- cast to the Chinese people. The danger of such weapons becoming common, or even becoming commonly known, among the people of the world, including the less developed nations, is very great, opening an opportunity to all kinds of political blackmail or even to merely irresponsible threats. The paral- lel danger from new weapons of chemical warfare are even more hor- rifving. One of the nerve gases now currently available in the United States is so potent that a small drop of it on an individual's unbroken skin can cause death in a few seconds. Moreover, manv of these BCVV weapons are cheap to make, and easier to make than to control. Most can be made in anv well-equipped kitchen or ordinary laboratory, with the chief restriction arising from the difficult safety precautions. But if the latter could be handled, and if delivery systems (which in some cases need be no more than men walking by fields or urban reservoirs) could be obtained, the deterrent effect of BCW weapons might he much greater than that of nuclear weapons now is, and would be much less predictable and forseeable, since thev would not be restricted, as the nuclear threat is, to heavily industrialized nations. This might well contribute toward the decentralization of power already mentioned. Another significant element in this complex picture is the convergence toward parallel paths of the United States and the Soviet Union. 1 nlS is, of course, something that rabid partisans of either side will refuse to recognize. It arises from three directions: (1) there is an absolute convergence of interests between the two states, as will be indicated in a moment; (2) the structures of the two countries are, to some extent."},{"pageNumber":1226,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  12 11 changing in similar ways; and (3) as the only Superpowers able to inflict or receive instant annihilation, these two countries, to some extent, stand apart from other states and in a class together. The last point is almost obvious, since it must be clear that onlv these two are prepared to engage in a race to the moon or have an almost insatiable demand for mathematicians or space scientists, or are looked to bv im- poverished neutrals as obligated to provide economic assistance to the latters' ambitions. The converging of interests of the two Superpowers arises largely from the other two factors. These common interests include a wide varietv of items, such as restricting the proliferation of nuclear weapons to additional states, establishing restrictions on the economic demands of neutral nations, especiallv bv refusing to allow one Superpower to be bid against the other; the ending of nuclear testing, the slowing up of the space race, the approaching domination of the United Nations by the growing majority of small and backward countries, the increasing aggressiveness of Red China, the unification of Germanv, the acceleration of the population explosion in backward areas, and manv others. Along with this convergence of interests is the growing parallelism of structure: (1) In spite of the great difference in the theories and the appearances of political life in the two countries, each is increasingly reaching its most fundamental decisions, not through partv politics or by decision in a political assembly, but bv the shifting pressures of great lobbying blocs acting upon each other by largely hidden contacts carried on behind the scenes. (2) These pressures are chiefly concerned with the allotment of economic resources, through fiscal and budgetary mechanisms, among three competing sectors of the economy concerned with consumption, governmental expenditures (chiefly defense), and capital investment. (3) Socially, both societies are undergoing a similar circulation of elites in which education is the chief doorway to social advancement and is crowded with applicants from the lower (but not lowest) stratum of society (equivalent to the petty bourgeoisie or lower middle classes) but is receiving relatively fewer successful applicants from the upper (but not uppermost) group whose parents are already established in the prevalent structure. (4) In both countries trained ex- perts and technicians, as a consequence of this educational process, are replacing political figures or other social groups, especially political spe- cialists. In both, the military leaders, although qualified for supreme influence by their possession of power, are held at secondary levels by personal manipulations. (5) In both countries there is a growing intellec- tual skepticism toward authority, accepted ideologies, and established slogans, replaced by a rising emphasis upon the need for satisfactory small-ijroup, interpersonal relations. As a result of all the complex interrelationships of weapons and politics"},{"pageNumber":1227,"pageContent":"1212  TRAGEDY AND HOPE that we have mentioned up to this point, it seems very likely that the international relations of the future will shift from the world we have known, in which war was epidemic and total, to one in which conflict is endemic and controlled. The ending of total warfare means the ending of war for unlimited aims (unconditional surrender, total victory, de- struction of the opponent's regime and social system), fought with weapons of total destruction and a total mobilization of resources, in- cluding men, to a condition of constant, flexible, controlled conflict with limited, specific, and shifting aims, sought by limited application of diverse pressures applied against any other state whose behavior we wish to influence. Such controlled conflict would involve a number of changes in our attitudes and behavior: i. No declarations of war and no breaking off of diplomatic relations with the adversary, but, instead, continuous communication with him, whatever level of intensity the conflict may reach. 2. Acceptance of the idea that conflict with an adversary in respect to some areas, activities, units, or weapons does not necessarily involve conflict with him in other areas, activities, units, or weapons. 3. Military considerations, and the use of force generally, will always be subordinate to political considerations, and will operate as part of policy in the whole policy context. 4. Armed forces must be fully professionalized, trained and psycholog- ically prepared to do any task to the degree and level they are ordered by the established political authorities, without desire or independent effort to carry combat to a level of intensity not in keeping with existing policy and political considerations. 5. There must be full ability at all times to escalate or to descalate the level of warfare as seems necessary in terms of the policy context, and to signal the decision to do either to the adversary as a guide to his responses. 6. Ability to descalate to the level of termination of violence and warfare must be possible, both in psychological and procedural terms, even with continuance of conflict on lower, nonforce, levels such as economic or ideological conflict. 7. There must exist a full panoply of weapons and of economic, polit- ical, social, and intellectual pressures that can be used in conflict with any diverse states to secure the specific and limited goals that would become the real aims of international policy in a period of controlled conflict- 8. Among the methods we must be prepared to use in such a period must be diplomatic or tacit agreement with any other state, including the Soviet Union or Red China, to seek parallel or joint aims in the world. This will be possible if all aims are limited to specific goals, which each state will recognize are not fatal to his general position and"},{"pageNumber":1228,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  121 3 regime, and by which one specific aim can be traded against another, even tacitly. This will become possible for the double reason that profes- sionalization of the fighting forces and the growing productiveness of the Superpower economies will not require either the total psychological mobilization or the almost total economic mobilization necessary in World War II. 9. All this means a blurring of the distinction between war and peace, with the situation at all times one of closely controlled conflict. In this way endemic conflict is accepted in order to avoid, if possible, epidemic total war. The change will become possible because the ultimate policy of all states will become the preservation of their way of life and existing regime, with the largest possible freedom of action. These aims can be retained under controlled conflict but will be lost by all concerned in total war. In spite of this shift in the whole pattern of international power rela- tions, the Soviet Union will remain for a long time the chief adversary of the United States, a situation for which there is no real solution until a new, and independent, Superpower rises on the land mass of Eurasia, preferably in a unified Western Europe. The fundamental differences between the United States and the Soviet Union will remain for a long time. They are critical, and include the following: (i) a basic difference in outlook in which the outlook of the West is based on diversity, rela- tivism, pluralism, and social consensus, while the Russian outlook is based on a narrow range of competing opinions and little diversity of knowledge, and is monolithic, intolerant, rigid, unified, absolute, and authoritarian; (2) the difference in stages of economic development, in which they are looking forward, with eager anticipation, to an affluent future, while we have already experienced an affluent society and are increasingly disillusioned with it; (3) the fact that the American economy is unique, because it is the only economy that no longer operates in terms of scarce resources. It may be inside a framework of scarce re- sources, but this framework is so much wider than the other limiting features of the system (notably its fiscal and financial arrangements) that the system itself does not operate within any limits established by that wider framework. The third distinction may be seen in the fact that, in other economies, when additional demands are presented to the economy, less resources are available for alternative uses. But in the American system, as it now stands, additional new demands usually lead to increased resources be- coming available for alternative purposes, notable consumption. Thus, if the Soviet Union embraced a substantial increase in space activity, the resources available for raising Russian levels of consumption would be reduced, while in America, any increases in the space budget makes levels of consumption also rise. It does this, in the latter case, because"},{"pageNumber":1229,"pageContent":"I 214  TRAGEDY AND HOPE increased space expenditures provide purchasing power for consumption that makes available previously unused resources out of the unused American productive capacity. This unusued productive capacity exists in the American economy because the structure of our economic system is such that it channels flows of funds into the production of additional capacity (investment) without any conscious planning process or any real desire by anyone to increase our productive capacity. It does this because certain institu- tions in our system (such as insurance, retirement funds, social security payments, undistributed corporate profits, and such) and certain individ- uals who personally profit by the flow of funds not theirs into invest- ment continue to operate to increase investment even when they have no real desire to increase productive capacity (and, indeed, many decry it). In the Soviet Union, on the contrary, resources are allotted to the increase of productive capacity by a conscious planning process and at the cost of reducing the resources available in their system for con- sumption or for the government (largely defense). Thus the meaning of the word \"costs\" and the limitations on ability to mobilize economic resources are entirely different in our system from the Soviet system and most others. In the Soviet economy \"costs\" are real costs, measurable in terms of the allotment of scarce resources that could have been used otherwise. In the American system \"costs\" are fiscal or financial limitations that have little connection with the use of scarce resources or even with the use of available (and therefore not scarce) resources. The reason for this is that in the American economy, the fiscal or financial limit is lower than the limit established by real re- sources and, therefore, since the financial limits act as the restraint on our economic activities, we do not get to the point where our activities encounter the restraints imposed by the limits of real resources (except rarely and briefly in terms of technically trained manpower, which is our most limited resource). These differences between the Soviet and the American economies are: (i) the latter has built-in, involuntary, institutionalized investment, which the former lacks, and (2) the latter has fiscal restraints at a much lower level of economic activity, which the Soviet system also lacks. Thus greater activity in defense in the USSR entails real costs since it puts pressure on the ceiling established by limited real resources, while greater activity in the American defense or space effort releases money into the system, which presses upward on the artificial financial ceiling, pressing it upward closer to the higher, and remote, ceiling established by the real resources limit of the American economy. This makes avail- able the unused productive capacity that exists in our system between the financial ceiling and the real resources ceiling; it not only makes these unused resources available for the governmental sector of die economy from which the expenditure was directly made but also makes"},{"pageNumber":1230,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IX PERSPECTIVE  1215  available portions of these released resources for consumption and ad- ditional capital investment. For this reason, government expenditures in the United States for things like defense or space mav entail no real costs at all in terms of the economv as a whole. In fact, if the volume of unused capacity brought into use bv expenditure for these things (that is, defense, and so on) is greater than the resources necessarv to satisfy the need for which the expenditure was made, the volume of unused resources made available for consumption or investment will be greater than the volume of resources used in the governmental ex- penditure, and this additional government effort will cost nothing at all in real terms, but will entail negative real costs. (Our wealth will be increased bv making the effort.) The basis for this strange, and virtuallv unique, situation is to be found in the large amount of unused productive capacitv in the United States, even in our most productive years. In the second quarter of 1962, our productive svstem was running at a verv high level of prosperity, yet it was functioning about 12 percent below capacitv, which represented a loss of S73 billion annuallv. In this way, in the whole period from the beginning of 1953 to the middle of 1962, our productive svstem operated at S387 billion below capacitv. Thus, if the svstem had operated near capacitv, our defense effort over the nine years would have cost us almost nothing, in terms of loss of goods or capacitv-. This unique character in the American economv rests on the fact that the utilization of resources follows flow lines in the economy that are not evervvhere reflected bv corresponding flow lines of claims on wealth (that is, money). In general, in our economy the lines of flow of claims on wealth are such that thev provide a very large volume of savings and a rather large volume of investment, even when no one really Wants new productive capacitv; thev also provide an inadequate flow of consumer purchasing power, in terms of the flows, or potential flows, of consumers' goods; but thev provide very limited, sharplv scrutinized, and often misdirected flows of funds for the use of resources to fulfill the needs of the governmental sector of our trisectored economv. As a result, we have our economv of distorted resource-utilization patterns, with overinvestment in manv areas, overstuffed consumers in one place and impoverished consumers in another place, a drastic undersupplv of social services, and widespread social needs for which public funds are lacking. In the Soviet Union, money flows follow fairly well the flows of real goods and resources, but, as a result, pressures are directly on re- sources. These pressures mean that saving and investment conflict directly with consumption and government services (including defense), putting the government under severe direct strains, as the demands for higher standards of living cannot be satisfied except by curtailing investment, defense, space, or other government expenditures. Many countries of the world, especially the backward ones, are worse"},{"pageNumber":1231,"pageContent":"I2l6  TRAGEDY AND HOPE off than the Soviet Union, because their efforts to increase consumers' goods may well require investment based on savings that must be ac- cumulated at the expense of consumption. In many areas, as we have seen in Asia, the Mediterranean, and Latin America, savings are ac- cumulated by structural monetary flows, but there are no institutional flows toward investment, little incentive or motivation for investment, and the economy lags in all three sectors. As a chief consequence of these conditions, the contrast between the \"have\" nations and the \"have-not\" nations will become even wider. This would be of little great importance to the rest of the world were it not that the peoples of the backward areas, riding the \"crisis of rising expectations,\" are increasingly unwilling to be ground down in poverty as their predecessors were. At the same time, the Superpower stalemate increases the abilities of these nations to be neutral, to exercise influence out of all relationship to their actual powers, and to act, sometimes, in an irresponsible fashion. These areas will be the chief sources of real trouble in the future, for clashes between the United States and the Soviet Union (or even Red China) are unlikely to arise from direct conflicts of interests, but may well arise from conflicts over neutmls- These neutrals and other peoples of backward areas have acute prob- lems. Solutions of these problems do exist, but the underdeveloped nations are unlikely to find them. As we have indicated elsewhere, their chief problems are three: (i) the relationship between population ex- plosion and limited food supplies; (2) problems of political stability* especially the relationship between political aims and quite diverse weap- ons-control patterns; and (3) the problem of obtaining constructive rather than destructive patterns of outlook. The United States and the Soviet Union have a common interest in seeing that these problems find solutions. In general, these underdeveloped nations cannot follow Amer- ican patterns, and are attracted to the Soviet svstcm despite its heavy costs in loss of personal freedoms. We do not have either the knowledge or influence that would make it possible for us to direct their steps along more desirable routes such as that followed bv Japan. One development in political life during the next generation or so that will be difficult to document is concerned with the very nature of the modern sovereign state. Like so much of our cultural heritage from the seventeenth century, such as international law and puritanism, this may now be in the process of a change so profound as to modify its very nature. As understood in western Europe over the last three centuries, the state was the organization of sovereign power on a territorial basis- \"Sovereign\" meant that the state (or ruler) had supreme legal authority to do just about anything regarded as public, and this authority ' m \" pinged directly on the subject (or citizen) without any intermedialie. or buffer corporations, and did this in a dualistic power antithesis typ' c"},{"pageNumber":1232,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  I217  of the Greek two-valued logic that was applied to almost everything in the seventeenth century. As part of this sovereign system, it was as- sumed that rights of property and of permanent association were not natural or eternal, but flowed from grants of sovereign power. Thus property in land required the state's recognition in the form of a docu- ment or deed, and no corporation could exist except at the charter of the sovereign or with his tacit consent. Moreover, all citizens on the territory were subject to the same sovereign power. The latter consisted, as it still largely does in our tradition, of a mixture of force (military), econ- omic rewards, and ideological uniformity. This view of public authority is by no means universal in the world, and shows strong indications that it may be changing in the West. Corporations exist and have the earliest mark of divinity (immortality), and have become, as they were in the nonsovereign Middle Ages, refuges where individuals may function shielded from the reach of the sovereign state. The once almost universal equivalence between residence and citizenship may be weakening. If the ideological state continues to develop its likely characteristics, per- sons of different ideologies and thus of different allegiances may become intermingled on the same territorv. The number of refugees and resident aliens is now increasing in most countries. Moreover, the incorporation of such a wide variety of peoples with such diverse traditions into the United Nations is also contributing to this process. We have seen that traditional China did not exercise power on the vast majority of its subjects (the peasants) in terms of force, rewards, or even ideology, but did so by social pressures through the intermediary of the familv and the gentrv. Similarly in Africa, power has been quite different in its character than it was in the traditional European state, and was based rather on kinship, social reciprocity, and religion. When African natives met to settle political disputes in battle, this was not, as in Europe, a clash of military force to settle the issue; rather it was an opportunity for spiritual entities to indicate their deci- sions in the case. As soon as a few casualties appeared on one side, this w as taken as an indication that the spirits concerned had made a decision adverse to that side, and, accordingly, the victims' associates broke and ran, leaving the field to the other side. Like the medieval judicial trial by battle or by ordeal, this was not an effort to settle a dispute by force, but the attempt to give a spiritual entity an opportunity to reveal its decision. It may seem farfetched to expect our state to succumb to the intro- duction of religious, magical, or spiritual influences such as this, but there can be little doubt that social pressures such as used to exercise influence in China will become more influential in our power structures in the future. It seems likely also that there will be a certain revival of the use of"},{"pageNumber":1233,"pageContent":"1218  TRAGEDY AND HOPE intermediaries in removing or weakening the impact of sovereign power on ordinary individuals. This implies a growth of federalism in the struc- ture of political power. On the whole, the history of federalism has not been a happv one. Even in the United States, the most significant example of a successful federalist structure in modern history, the feder- alist principle has yielded ground to unitary government for 150 years or so. Moreover, in our own time a number of efforts, chiefly British, to set up federal unions have failed. Thus the Central African Federation of the Rhodesias and Nyasaland broke up after a few years, and the West Indies Federation was even less viable. Recently the Malaysian Federation of the Malay States, Singapore, North Borneo, and Sarawak has been threatened with destruction by Indonesia, itself once a federal system that has now largely yielded to unitary developments. Nevertheless, the federal principle seems likely to grow as a method by which certain functions of government are allotted to one structure while other functions go to a narrower or wider structure. This tendency seems likely to arise from a number of influences of which the chief might be: (1) the inability of many of the new, small states to carry on all the functions of government independently and alone, and their consequent efforts to carrv out some of them cooperatively; (2) the tendency for these new states to look to the United Nations to perform some of the most significant functions of government, such as defense of frontiers or maintaining public order; for example, Tanganyika re- cently disbanded its armed forces and entrusted its defense and public order to a Nigerian force under United Nations control; (3) the n eeCl for economic cooperation over wider areas than the boundaries of mos states in order to obtain the necessary diversity of resources within a single economic system, a need that will continue to encourage the establishment of customs unions and economic blocs, of which the European Common Market is the outstanding example; similar unions are projected for Central America and other areas. The most interesting example of this process may be seen in the slow growth of some kind of multilevel federal structure covering muc of tropical Africa. This arose from the disintegration of the Frenc colonial svstem in Black Africa in 1956-1960 and was known as tn Brazzaville Twelve at first (from December in i960), but is now muc expanded to include non-French areas under the name Union of Africa\" and Malagasy States. This Union shows a tendency to become one ° the middle layers in a multilevel political hierarchy. In this hierarchy 1 the top level is held bv the United Nations and its associated functiona bodies, such as the World Health Organization, UNESCO, the Food and Agricultural Organization, the ILO, the International Monetar.

The De Gaulle veto on the continued development of these has suspended their growth and also any tendency for them to coalesce with a number of older French Community organizations. On the third, fourth, and fifth levels is a rather confused mass of organizations of which the third consists of those which are Pan-African in scope, the fourth are those allied with the UAMS, and the fifth are the relatively viable Brazzaville Twelve projects. On the third level are such organizations as the Economic Commission for Africa South of the Sahara, the Technical Cooperation Commission for Africa, the Scientific Council for Africa, two African commissions of the World Conference of Organizations of the Teaching Professions, the African Trade Union Confederation (set up at Dakar in 1962), and a number of others. On the fifth level are a whole series of organizations associated with the Brazzaville Twelve, its semiannual \"summit conferences\" of heads of state, its Secretary General and Secretariat, its Defense Union, its Organ- ization for Economic Cooperation, and others. On the fourth level are similar organizations, including an Assembly of Heads of States, a Council of Members, and a Secretariat-General set up for the UAMS at Lagos in January 1962. Possibly these third, fourth, and fifth levels will coalesce and eliminate some reduplication as memberships become firmer. On the sixth level are a number of local unions of states, such as those for local river controls, customs unions, and such. And on the seventh level are the individual states which in theory (like the states of the United States) will continue to hold full sovereignty. But when two- third votes on higher levels can make binding decisions on member states, or when states intend to vote as a bloc in the United Nations, or when states have reduced their military and police forces so that they ate dependent on forces from higher levels to defend their territories or to maintain order, or when states look to higher levels for funds for \"Westment or to restore their annual foreign-exchange imbalances, the realities of sovereign power become dispersed and some areas of the World begin to look more like the Germanies of the late medieval period than like the nationalist sovereign states of the nineteenth century. How far this process will go we cannot foretell, but the possibility of such devel opments should not be excluded by us just because they have not been experienced by us in recent generations. This is more than enough on the power patterns in our near future. Xv c must now turn to a much briefer discussion of the patterns of econ- Oinic and social life. There we see a most extraordinary contrast. While the economic life of Western society has been increasingly successful"},{"pageNumber":1235,"pageContent":"1220  TRAGEDY AND HOPE in satisfying our material needs, the social aspect has become increasingly frustrating. There was a time, not long ago, when the chief aims of most Western men was for greater material goods and for rising standards of living. This was achieved at great social costs, by the attrition or even destruction of much of social life, including the sense of community fellowship, leisure, and social amenities. Looking backward, we are fully aware of these costs in the original factory towns and urban slums, but looking about us today we are often not aware of the great, often in- tangible, costs of middle-class living in suburbia or in the dormitory environs that surround European cities: the destruction of social com- panionship and solidarity, the narrowing influence of exposure to persons from a restricted age group or from a narrow segment of social class, the horrors of commuting, the incessant need for constant driving about to satisfy the ordinary needs of the family for groceries, medical care, entertainment, religion, or social experience, the prohibitive cost and inconvenience of upkeep and repairs and, in general, the whole way of life of the suburban \"rat race,\" including the large-scale need for pro- viding artificial activities for children. Rebellion against this rat race has already begun, not from the lower middle class who are just entering it and still aspire to it, but from the established middle class who have, as they say, \"had it.\" On the whole, the efforts to find a way out while still retaining a high standard of material living have not been successful, and the real rebellion is coming, as we shall see later, from their children. These have expanded the usual adolescent revolt against parental dominance and authority into a large- scale rejection of parental values. One form that this revolt has taken has been to modify the meaning of the expression \"high standard of living to include a whole series of desires and values that are not material and thus were excluded from the nineteenth-century bourgeois under- standing of the expression \"standard of living.\" Among these are two we have already listed as disconcerting elements in the Africans' under- standing of standard of living: small group interpersonal relationships and sex play. These changes, as we shall see, have come to represent a challenge to the whole middle-class outlook. The social costs of the contemporary economic system are staggering- On the whole, they have been widely discussed and are generally recog- nized. As economic enterprises have become larger and more tightly integrated into one another, the freedom, individualism, and initiative traditionally associated with the modern economy (in contrast with the medieval rural economy) have had to be sacrificed. The self-reliant indi- vidual has gradually changed into the conformist \"organization man. Routine has displaced risk, and subordination to abstractions has replaced the struggle with diverse concrete problems. The constantly narrowing range of possibilities for self-expression has given rise to deep frustrations"},{"pageNumber":1236,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  1221  with their concomitant growth of irrational compensating customs, such as the obsession with speed; vicarious combativeness, especially in sports; the use of alcohol, tobacco, narcotics, and sex as stimulants, diversions, and sedatives; and the rapid appearance and disappearance of fads in dress, social customs, and leisure activities. Most crucial have been the demands of the modern industrial and business system, because of advancing technology, for more highly trained manpower. Such training requires a degree of ambition, self- discipline, and future-preference that many persons lack or refuse to provide, with the result that a growing lowest social class of the social outcasts (the Lumpenproletariat) has reappeared. This group of rejects from our bourgeois industrial society provide one of our most intractable future problems, because they are gathered in urban slums, have political influence, and are socially dangerous. In the United States, where these people congregate in the largest cities and are often Negroes or Latin Americans, they are regarded as a racial or economic problem, but they are really an educational and social problem for which economic or racial solutions would help little. This group is most numerous in the more advanced industrial areas and now forms more than twenty percent of the American population. Since they are a self-perpetuating group and have many children, they are increasing in numbers faster than the rest of the population. Their self-perpetuating characteristic as a group is not based on biological differences but on sociological factors, chiefly on the fact that disorganized, undisciplined, present-preference parents living under chaotic economic and social con- ditions are most unlikely to train their children in the organized, discip- lined, future-preference and orderly habits the modern economic system requires in its workers, so that the children, like their parents, grow up as unemployables. This is not a condition that can be cured by providing more jobs, even if the jobs are in the proper areas, because the jobs require characteristics these victims of anomie do not possess and are unlikely to acquire. All this leads to one of the most significant of current changes, the changes in attitudes and outlooks. At this point we shall not discuss the middle-class outlook and its challenges, which are the central aspect of. this subject in the United States, but shall restrict ourselves to an equally large subject, the changes in the outlook of Western society as a whole, especially in Europe. The intellectual and religious aspects of any society, including all those things I call \"pattern of outlook,\" change at least as rapidly as the more material aspects of the society, and are generally less noticed. Among these the most significant, and the least noticed, are the cate- gories into which any society divides its experiences in order to think about them or to talk about them and the values the society, often in"},{"pageNumber":1237,"pageContent":"1222  TRAGEDY AND HOPE unconscious consensus, places upon these categories. In every society there are certain groups, perhaps an intellectual elite, who think new thoughts, new at least in comparison with what went just before. In time, some of these thoughts spread and become familiar, until it may seem that everybody is thinking them. Of course, everybody is not, be- cause in every society there are three other groups: the large group who do not think at all, the substantial group who are not aware of anvthing new and who retain the same outlook for vears and even generations, and the small group who are always opposed to the consensus simply because opposition has become an end in itself. In spite of these complexities, we can still look at the past and see a sequence of prevalent outlooks, often with rather confused periods of transition in between. Over the past two centuries, there have been five such stages: the Enlightenment in 1730-1790, the Romantic Movement in 1790-1850, the Age of Scientific Materialism in 1850-1895, the Period of Irrational Activism of 1895-1945, and our new Age of Inclusive Diversity since 1945. These changing patterns of outlooks arise because men are compli- cated creatures trying to operate in a complex universe. Both man and universe are dynamic, or changeable in time, and the chief additional complexity is that both are changing in a continuum of abstraction, as well as in the more familiar continuum of space-time. The continuum of abstraction simplv means that the reality in which man and the uni- verse function exists in five dimensions; of these the dimension of ab- straction covers a range from the most concrete and material end of reality to, at the opposite extreme, the most abstract and spiritual end of reality, with every possible gradation between these two ends along the intervening dimensions that determine realitv, including the three dimensions of space, the fourth of time, and this fifth dimension of abstraction. This means that man is concrete and material at one end of his person, is abstract and spiritual at the other end, and covers all the gradations between, with a large central zone concerned with his chaos of emotional experiences and feelings. In order to think about himself or the universe with the more abstract and rational end of his being, man has to categorize and to conceptualize both his own nature and the nature of reality, while, in order to act and to feel on the less abstract end of his being, he must function more directlv, outside the limits of categories, without the buffer of concepts- Thus man might look at his own being as divided into three levels 01 body, emotions, and reason. The body, functioning directly in space- time-abstraction, is much concerned with concrete situations, individual and unique events, at a specific time and place. The middle levels CM his being are concerned with himself and his reactions to reality in terms of feelinq-s and emotions as determined by endocrine and neurologies"},{"pageNumber":1238,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  1223  reactions. The upper levels of his being are concerned with his neurolog- ical analysis and manipulation of conceptualized abstractions. The three corresponding operations of his being are sensual, emotional or intuitive, and rational. The sequence of intellectual history is concerned with the sequence of styles or fads that have been prevalent, one after another, as to what emphasis or combinations of man's three levels of operations would be used in his efforts to experience life and to cope with the universe. In the most general terms, we might say that primitive man emphasized an empirical approach to these problems with use of man's sensual equip- ment and chief emphasis on specific concrete situations; archaic man (say from 5000 B.C. to about 500 B.C. in Eurasia) emphasized man's emotional and intuitive equipment with emphasis on symbols, ritual, myth, and magical actions; Classical man (sav from 500 B.C. to A.D. 500) emphasized man's rational equipment and regarded man's concepts as the major portion of reality. But Western man, since A.D. 500, has sought to find some combination of all three parts of his equipment that will provide satisfactory explanation and successful operation in terms both of man's nature and of the universe. The combinations lie has tried provide the changing sequence of intellectual history. The Age of Enlightenment, following on the successes of the Age of Newton (which had discovered a rational and mechanical expla- nation of the material universe), tried to apply the same techniques to man and society, and came up with a static, mechanical, and ration- alist conception of both. The inadequacy of this view of man, already rejected by poets and literary figures in the mid-eighteenth century, led to its general rejection as inadequate because of the excesses of the French Revolution. The following Romantic period, accordingly, adopted a much more irrational picture of man, of society, and of the universe. As a consequence, emphasis shifted from the earlier rational, mechanical, and static views to irrational and dynamic views of man and society. This period of Romanticism (about 1790-1850) was marked by poets of \"storm and stress,\" the Gothic revival, and a growing emphasis on history as the correct key to understanding man and society. The period, associated with Hegel, Hugo, and Heine, culminated in Karl .Marx's Communist Manifesto (1848), which found the key to man's social po- sition in past struggles. The third generation of the nineteenth century (1850-1895) was in an age of science and rationalism whose typical figures were Darwin and Bismarck. While emphasizing the empirical and rational aspects of science, it tried to apply these to biology and to history in terms of a scientific materialism that could explain biology and change as New- ton's science had explained mechanics. By the end of the century, man"},{"pageNumber":1239,"pageContent":"1224  TRAGEDY AND HOPE was frustrated and disillusioned with scientific method and materialism and with emphasis on the nonhuman world and was turning once again to the problems of man and society with a conviction that these problems could be handled only by nonrational methods and by the clash of contending forces, since the problems themselves were too complex, too dynamic, too irrational to be settled by science or even by human thought. The result was a new period, the Age of Irrational Activism. It began with men, like Henri Bergson and Sigmund Freud, who emphasized the nonrational nature of the universe and of man, quicklv shifted Darwin's doctrines of struggle and survival from nonhuman nature to human so- ciety, and rejected rationalism as slow, superficial, and an inhibition on both action and survival. As Bergson said in his Creative Evolution (1907): \"The intellect is characterized by a natural inability to compre- hend life. Instinct, on the contrary, is molded on the very form of life.' This period felt that man, and nature, and human society were all basically irrational. Reason, regarded as a late and rather superficial accre- tion in the process of human evolution, was considered inadequate to plumb the real nature of man's problems, and was regarded as an inhibitor on the full intensity of his actions, an obstacle to the survival of him- self as an individual and of his group (the nation). Any effort to apply reason or science, based on rational analysis and evaluation, would be a slow and frustrating effort: slow because the process of human rationality is always slow, frustrating because it cannot plumb into the real depths and nature of man's experience, and because it can always turn up as many and as good reasons for any course of action as it can for the op- posite course of action. The effort to do this was dangerous, because as the thinker poised in indecision, the man of action struck, eliminated the thinker from the scene, and survived to determine the future on the basis of continued action. To the theorist of these views, the thinker would always be divided, hesitant, and weak, while the man of action would be unified, decisive, and strong. This point of view, nourished on Marx and Heinrich von Treitschke, justified class conflicts and national warfare, and formed the background for the cult of violence that was reflected in the political assassinations of 1898-1914 and the imperialist aggressions that began with Japan. Italy, and Britain in China, Ethiopia, and South Africa in 1894-1899. The explicit justification of this view could be found in Georges Sorel R?~ flexions stir la Violence (1908) or in the political events of the summer of 1914. From that fateful summer, for more than forty years, higher levels of violence became the solution of all problems, whether it was the question of winning a war, Stalin's efforts to industrialize Russia, Hitlers efforts to settle the \"Jewish problem,\" Rupert Brooke's effort to find meaning in life, Japan's desire to find a solution to economic depression)"},{"pageNumber":1240,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  121$  the English-speaking nations' search for security, Italy's search for glory, or Franco's desire to preserve the status quo in Spain. The culmination of the process in total irrationalism and total violence was Nazism, \"The Revolution of Nihilism.\" Expressed explicitly this cult of Irrational Activism was based on the belief that the universe was dvnamic and largely nonrational. As such, any effort to deal with it bv rational means will be futile and superficial. Moreover, rationalism, b\\ r paralyzing man's ability to act decisively, will expose him to destruction in a world whose chief features include strug- gle and conflict. Men came to believe that only violence had survival value. The resulting cult of violence permeated all human life. By mid- century, the popular press, literature, the cinema, sports, and all major human concerns had embraced this cult of violence. The books of Mickey Spillane or Raymond Chandler sold millions to satisfy this need. Hum- phrey Bogart became the most popular film hero because he courted Women with a blow to the jaw. On a somewhat more profound level, the Nazi Party mobilized pop- ular support with a program of \"Blood and Soil\" (Blut und Boden), while the Fascists in Italy covered every wall with their slogan, \"Believe! Obev! Fight!\" In neither was there any expectation that men should think or analyze. On the highest philosophic levels, the new attitude was justified. Berg- son appealed to intuition, and Hitler used it. Other philosophers vied with one another to demonstrate that the old mechanism of abstract, rational thought must be rejected as irrelevant, superficial, or meaning- less. The semanticists rejected logic by rejecting the idea of general cate- gories or even of definition of terms. According to them, because every- thing is constantlv changing, no term can remain fixed without at once becoming irrelevant. The meaning of any word depended on the context in which it was used; since this was different every time it was used, the nieaning, consisting of a series of connotations based on all previous uses of the term, is different at each use. Every individual who uses a term is simply the culmination of all his past experiences that make him what he J s; since experience never stops, he is a different person every time he uses a term, and it has a different meaning for him. On this basis the Ital- J an playwright Luigi Pirandello (i867-1936) wrote a series of works to show the constantly changing nature of personality, which is also a re- flection of the context in which it operates, so that each person who meets someone knows him as a different personality. The most widelv read of twentieth-century philosophers, the existen- tialists, reflected this same attitude, although thev could agree on almost nothing. In general they were skeptical of anv general principles about reality, but recognized that realitv did exist for each individual as the concrete instant of time, place, and context in which he acted. Thus he"},{"pageNumber":1241,"pageContent":"1226  TRAGEDY AND HOPE must act. In order to act he must make a decision, a commitment, to something that would give him a basis from which to act. By acting he experiences reality, and to that extent knows and demonstrates, at least to himself, that there is a reality. All these ideas, reflecting the disjointed malaise of the century, perme- ated the outlook of the period and left it hungry for meaning, for iden- tity, for some structure or purpose in human experience. Insanity, neuro- sis, suicide, and all kinds of irrational obsessions and reactions filled increasing roles in human life. Most of these were not even recognize\" as being irrational or obsessive. Speed, alcohol, sex, coffee, and tobacco screened man off from living, injuring his health, stultifying his capacity to think, to observe, or to enjoy life, without his realizing that these were the shields he adopted to conceal from himself the fact that he was no longer really capable of living, because he no longer knew what life v' 3S and could see no meaning or purpose in it. As his capacity to live or to experience life dwindled, he sought to reach it by seeking more vigorous experiences that might penetrate the barriers surrounding him. Thd re- sult was mounting sensationalism. In time, nothing made much impression unless it was concerned with shocking violence, perversion, or distortion- Along with this, ability to communicate dwindled. The old idea of communication as an exchange of concepts represented by svmbols was junked. Instead, symbols had quite different connotations for everyone concerned simply because everyone had a different past experience. A symbol might have meaning for two persons but it did not have the same meaning. Soon it was regarded as proper that words represent only the writer's meaning and need have no meaning at all for the reader. Thus appeared private poetry, personal prose, and meaningless art in wine 1 the svmbols used have ceased to be symbols because they do not reflec any common background of experience that could indicate their mean- ing as shared communication or experience. These productions, the f a of the day, were acclaimed by many as works of genius. Those who ques tioned them and asked their meaning were airily waved aside as unto givable philistines; they were told that no one any longer sought \"mean ing\" in literature or art but rather sought \"experiences.\" Thus to look a a meaningless painting became an experience. These fads followed o another, reflecting the same old pretenses, but under different name-- Thus \"Dada\" following World War I eventually led to the \"Absurd\" tol- lowing World War II.

The West in World War II and in the postwar period, in spite of the hysteri- cal protests of the extremists, showed once again that it was able to over- come aggression, narrow intolerance, hatred, tribalism, totalitarianism, selfishness, arrogance, imposed uniformity, and all the evils the West had recognized as evils throughout its history. It not only won the war: it solved the great economic crisis, prevented the extension of tyranny While still avoiding World War III, and did all this in a typical Western Way by fumbling cooperatively down a road paved with good inten- tions. The final result was a triumph of incalculable magnitude for the Outlook of the West. Tlie Outlook of the West is that broad middle way about which the fads and foibles of the West oscillate. It is what is implied by what the West says it believes, not at one moment but over the long succession °f moments that form the history of the West From that succession of foments it is clear that the West believes in diversity rather than in uni- formity, in pluralism rather than in monism or dualism, in inclusion rather than exclusion, in liberty rather than in authority, in truth rather than ! n power, in conversion rather than in annihilation, in the individual father than in the organization, in reconciliation rather than in triumph, \"i heterogeneity rather than in homogeneity, in relativisms rather than 'n absolutes, and in approximations rather than in final answers. The West believes that man and the universe are both complex and that the a Pparently discordant parts of each can be put into a reasonably work- able arrangement with a little good will, patience, and experimentation, •n man the West sees body, emotions, and reason as all equally real and necessary, and is prepared to entertain discussion about their relative in- terrelationships but is not prepared to listen for long to any intolerant insistence that any one of these has a final answer. The West has no faith in final answers today. It believes that all an- gers are unfinal because everything is imperfect, although possibly get- ting better and thus advancing toward a perfection the West is pre- pared to admit may be present in some remote and almost unattainable future. Similarly in the universe, the West is prepared to recognize that there are material aspects, less material aspects, immaterial aspects, and spiritual aspects, although it is not prepared to admit that anyone yet has a final answer on the relationships of these. Similarly the West is prepared to admit that society and groups are necessary, while the in- dividual is important, but it is not prepared to admit that either can stand alone or be made the ultimate value to the sacrifice of the other. Where rationalists insist on polarizing the continua of human experi- ence into antithetical pairs of opposing categories, the West has con- stantly rejected the implied need for rejection of one or the other, by"},{"pageNumber":1243,"pageContent":"1228  TRAGEDY AND HOPE embracing \"Both.\" This catholic attitude goes back to the earliest days of Western society when its outlook was being created in the religious controversies of the preceding Classical Civilization. Among these con- troversies were the following: (i) Was Christ Man or God? (2) Was salvation to be secured by God's grace or by man's good works? (3) Was the material world real and good or was spirituality real and good? (4) Was the body worthy of salvation or was the soul only to be saved? (5) Was the truth found only by God's revelation or was it to be found by man's experience (history)? (6) Should man work to save himself or to save others? (7) Does man owe allegiance to God or to Caesar. (8) Should man's behavior be guided by reason or by observation? (9) Can man be saved inside the Church or outside it? In each case, with vigorous partisans clamoring on both sides (and in many cases still clam- oring), the answer, reached as a consensus built up by long discussion, was Both. In fact a correct definition of the Christian tradition might well be expressed in that one word \"Both.\" Throughout its long history, controversy over religion in Western society has been based on a dis- turbance of the arrangement or balance within that \"Both.\" From this religious basis established on \"Both\" as early as the Councils of Nicaea (325) and Chalcedon (451), the outlook of the West devel- oped and spread with the growth of the new Christian Civilization 01 the West to replace the dying Classical Civilization. And today, when the Civilization of the West seems as if it too may be dying, we may reassure ourselves by recalling that our civilization has saved itself before by turn- ing back to its tradition of Inclusive Diversity. This apparently is what has been happening since 1940. It was Inclusive Diversity that created the nuclear bomb in World War II, and it may well be Inclusive Diversity that will save the W'est in the postwar world. Any outlook or society that finds its truth in Inclusive Diversity or i° \"Both\" obviously faces a problem of relationships. If man finds the truth by using body, emotions, and reason, these diverse talents must be placed in some workable arrangement with one another. So too must service to God and to Caesar or to self and to fellow man. In an age like ours, in which all these relationships ha% r e become dis- rupted and discordant, such relationships can be reestablished by discus- sion and testing, but in this process each discussant must rely on his eX\" perience. The great body of such experience, however, will not be found among living discussants, whose whole lives have been passed in a cultur in which these relationships were discordant, but in the experiences 0 those whose lives were lived in earlier ages before the relationship i question became discordant. This gives rise to the typical Western solu- tion of reiving on experience and, at the same time, helps the society t0 link up with its traditions (the most therapeutic action in which an/ society can engage). From this examination of the tradition of the West, we can formulate"},{"pageNumber":1244,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  I229  the pattern of outlook on which this tradition is based. It has six parts: 1. There is a truth, a reality. (Thus the West rejects skepticism, solip- sism, and nihilism.) 2. No person, group, or organization has the whole picture of the truth. (Thus there is no absolute or final authority.) 3. Ever) 7 person of goodwill has some aspect of the truth, some vision of it from the angle of his own experience. (Thus each has something to contribute.) 4. Through discussion, the aspects of the truth held by many can be pooled and arranged to form a consensus closer to the truth than any of the sources that contributed to it. 5. This consensus is a temporary approximation of the truth, which is no sooner made than new experiences and additional information make it possible for it to be reformulated in a closer approximation of the truth by continued discussion. 6. Thus Western man's picture of the truth advances, by successive approximations, closer and closer to the whole truth without ever reach- ing it. This methodology of the West is basic to the success, power, and Wealth of Western Civilization. It is reflected in all successful aspects of Western life, from the earliest beginnings to the present. It has been attacked and challenged by all kinds of conflicting methods and outlooks, by all kinds of alternative attitudes based on narrowness and rigidity, but it has reappeared, again and again, as the chief source of strength of that amazing cultural growth of which we are a part. This method has basically been the method of operation in Western religious history, despite the many lapses of Western religion into authori- tarian, absolute, rigid, and partial affirmations. The many problems, Previously listed, that faced the Church at the time of the Council of Nicaea were settled by this Western method. Throughout Western re- ligious history, in spite of the frequent outbursts by dissident groups insisting that the truth was available—total, explicit, final, and authorita- tive— in God's revelation, Western religious thought has continued to be- lieve that revelation itself is never final, total, complete, or literal, but is a continuous symbolic process that must be interpreted and reinterpreted °y discussion. The method of the West, even in religion, has been this: The truth unfolds in time by a cooperative process of discussion that creates a temporary consensus which we hope will form successive approxima- tions growing closer and closer to the final truth, to be reached only in some final stage of eternity. In the Christian tradition the stages in this u nfolding process for each individual are numerous; they include: (1) bail's intuitive sense of natural law and morality, (2) the Old Testament, '3) the New Testament, (4) the long series of Church councils and ec clesiastical promulgations that will continue indefinitely into the fu-"},{"pageNumber":1245,"pageContent":"123°  TRAGEDY AND HOPE ture, (5) for each individual a continued process of knowledge in eternity after death, and, finally, (6) the Beatific Vision. Until this final sta^e, all versions of the truth, even when their factual content is based on divine revelation, must be understood and interpreted by community discussion in terms of past experiences and traditions. This version of the religious tradition of the West as an example of the Western outlook as a whole may seem to manv to be contradicted by the narrow intolerance, rigid bigotry, and relentless persecutions that have disfigured so much of the religious history of the West. This is true, and is a clear indication that individuals and groups can fall far short of •their own traditions, can lose these for long periods, and can even devote their lives to fighting against them. But the traditions of the West, cer- tainly the most remarkable any civilization has had, always seem to come back and march on to other victories. Even in our day, in Vatican Coun- cil II we can see what outsiders may regard as surprising efforts to apply Western traditions to an organization which, to most outsiders, and even, perhaps, to most insiders, must appear as one of the most authoritarian organizations ever created. But the tradition is there, however buried or forgotten, and the realization of this has made Vatican Council II a sym- bol of hope, even to non-Catholics and even to those who realize it will not do half the things that are crying urgently to be done. Before we leave this subject, concerned with an area (religion) and an organization (the Roman Catholic Church) where we might expect the tradition of the West to be weak or even absent, we might comment on one other issue. The rigidity of Western religious thought that often seems to be unappreciative of the Western tradition (although funda- mentally it is not) is often explained by the role divine revelation pla>' s in Western religion. The Word of God may seem to many a rigid and inflexible element repugnant to the flexible and tentative outlook I have identified as the tradition of the West. But, on an early page of the ne^' version of Thomas Aquinas now appearing in English in sixty volumes. we read this typical Western comment on the role of revelation in re- ligious truth: \"Revelation is not oracular. . . . Propositions do not descend on us from heaven ready made, but are . . . more a draft of work 1° progress than a final and completed document, for faith itself, though rooted in immutable truth is not crowning knowledge, and its elaboration in teaching, namely theology, is still more bound up with discourses progressively manifesting fresh truths or fresh aspects of the truth to the mind. So the individual Christian and the Christian community grow i n understanding; indeed, they must if, like other living organisms, they are to survive by adaptation to a changing environment of history, ideas, and social pressures.\" * * The Sitnmta Theologiae of Saint Thomas Aquinas; Latin Text and Engl' s Translation, Vol. I (New York, McGraw-Hill, 1904), p. 102."},{"pageNumber":1246,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IX PERSPECTIVE  1231  To the West, in spite of all its aberrations, the greatest sin, from Lucifer to Hitler, has been pride, especially in the form of intellectual arrogance; and the greatest virtue has been humility, especially in the intellectual form which concedes that opinions are always subject to modification by new experiences, new evidence, and the opinions of our fellow men. These procedures that I have identified as Western, and have illustrated from the rather unpromising field of religion, are to be found in all as- pects of Western life. The most triumphant of these aspects is science, whose method is a perfect example of the Western tradition. The scientist goes eagerly to work each day because he has the humility to know that he does not have any final answers and must work to modify and im- prove the answers he has. He publishes his opinions and research re- Ports, or exposes these in scientific gatherings, so that they may be sub- jected to the criticism of his colleagues and thus gradually play a role in formulating the constantly unfolding consensus that is science. That is what science is, \"a consensus unfolding in time by a cooperative effort, in which each works diligently seeking the truth and submits his work to the discussion and critique of his fellows to make a new, slightly im- proved, temporary consensus.\" Because this is the tradition of the West, the West is liberal. Most historians see liberalism as a political outlook and practice found in the nineteenth century. But nineteenth-century liberalism was simply a temporary organizational manifestation of what has always been the Underlying Western outlook. That organizational manifestation is now largely dead, killed as much by twentieth-century liberals as by con- servatives or reactionaries. It was killed because liberals took applications of that manifestation of the Western outlook and made these applications- rigid, ultimate, and inflexible goals. The liberal of 1880 was anticlerical, antimilitarist, and antistate because these were, to his immediate experi- ence, authoritarian forces that sought to prevent the operation of the Western way. The same liberal was for freedom of assembly, of speech, and of the press because these were necessary to form the consensus that is so much a part of the Western process of operation. But by 1900 or so, these dislikes and likes became ends in themselves. Tlie liberal was prepared to force people to associate w ith those they could not bear, in the name of freedom of assembly, or he was, in the n anie of freedom of speech, prepared to force people to listen. His anti- clericalism became an effort to prevent people from getting religion, and his antimilitarism took the form of opposing funds for legitimate defense. 'Most amazing, his earlier opposition to the use of private economic power to restrict individual freedoms took the form of an effort to increase the authority of the state against private economic power and wealth in themselves. Thus the liberal of 1880 and the liberal of 1940 had re- Versed themselves on the role and power of the state, the earlier seeking"},{"pageNumber":1247,"pageContent":"1232  TRAGEDY AND HOPE to curtail it, the latter seeking to increase it. In the process, the upholder of the former liberal idea that the power of the state should be curtailed came to be called a conservative. This simply added to the intellectual confusion of the mid-twentieth century, which arose from the Irrational Activist reluctance to define any terms, a disinclination that has now penetrated deeply into all intellectual and academic life. In this connection we might say that the whole recent controversy between conservatism and liberalism is utterly wrongheaded and ignorant. Since the true role of conservatism must be to conserve the tradition of our society, and since that tradition is a liberal tradition, the two should be closely allied in their aim at common goals. So long as liberals and conservatives have as their primary goals to defend interests and to belabor each other for partisan reasons, they cannot do this. When they decide to look at the realities beneath the controversies, they might begin with a little book that appeared many years ago (1902) from the hand of a member of the chief family in the English Conservative Party over the past century. The book is Conservatism by Lord Hugh Cecil. This volume defines conservatism very much as I have defined liberalism and the Outlook of the West as tentative, flexible, undogmatic, communal, and moderate. Its fundamental assumption is that men are imperfect crea- tures, will probably get further by working together than by blind op- position, and that, since undoubtedly each is wrong to some extent, any extreme or drastic action is inadvisable. Conservatism of this type was, indeed, closer to what I have called liberalism than the liberals of 188° were, since the conservatives of this type were perfectly willing to use the Church or the army or the state to carry out their moderate and tentative projects, and were prepared to use the state to curtail arbitrary private economic power, which the liberals of the day were unwilling to do (since they embraced a doctrinaire belief in the limitation of state power). All this is of significance because it is concerned with the fact that there is an asre-old Western tradition, much battered and destroyed m recent generations, that has sent up new, living shoots of vigorous growt' 1 since 1945. These new shoots have appeared even in those areas where the orthodox nineteenth-century liberals looked to find only enemies—m the Church and in the armed forces. The operation of what I have called the liberal tradition of the West is evident in all religious thought of r c \" cent years, even in that of Roman Catholicism. It is almost equally ev- ident in military life, where the practice of consulting diverse, and even outside, opinion to reach tentative decisions is increasingly obvious. Ke- cently I attended a conference of the United States Navy Special Projects Office where a diverse group tried to reach some consensus about the form of naval weapons systems twelve years in the future. The agenda, as set up for seven weeks, provided for thirty-three successive appro*\""},{"pageNumber":1248,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  1233  imations narrowing in on the desired consensus. This was listed on the agenda as \"Final Approximation and Crystallization of Dissent.\" The recognition that the final goal wr.s still approximate, and the equal role provided for disagreement within this consensus, show clearly how the tradition of the West operates today within the armed forces of the West. This return to the tradition of the West is evident in many aspects of life beyond those mentioned here. Strangely enough, the return of which we speak is much more evident in the United States than it is in Europe, and, accordingly, some of the most significant examples of it will be mentioned in the following section, which is concerned with the United States. The reason for this, apparently, is that Europeans, after their very dif- ficult experiences of depression and war, are now overly eager for the mundane benefits made possible by advancing technology and are, as a result, increasingly selfish and materialistic, while Americans, having tasted the fleshpots of affluence, are increasingly unselfish, community- conscious, and nonmaterial in their attitudes. A careful look, however, will show that the movement is present on both sides of the Atlantic, and appears perhaps most obviously in a growing concern with one's fellow men, a kind of practical Christianity, and a spreading evidence of charity and love in the old Christian meaning of these terms. There seems to be, especially among the younger generation, a growing emphasis on fellowship and interpersonal relations and an increasing skepticism to- ward abstract power, high-blown slogans, old war cries, and authority. There is a reaching out to one another, seeking to understand, to help, to comfort. There is a growing tolerance of differences, an amused atti- tude of live and let live; and, above all, there is an avid discussion of values and priorities that include more spiritual items than a generation ago. There is an almost universal rejection of authority, of rigid formulas, and of final or total answers. In a word, there is a fumbling effort to re- discover the tradition of the West by a generation that has been largely cut off from that tradition. We have said that this tradition is one of Inclusive Diversity in which one of the chief problems is how elements that seem discordant, but are recognized as real and necessary, may be fitted together. The solution to this problem, which rests in the tradition itself, is to be found in the J dea of hierarchy: diverse elements are discordant only because they are °ut of place. Once the proper arrangement is found, discord is replaced by concord. Once, long ago, a young person said to me, \"Dirt is only misplaced matter\"—a typically Western attitude.

In what order should they be arranged? This is quite different from the successful young man of yesteryear who had one clearly perceived goal-to prepare for a career in moneymaking. The road to that career was marked by materialism, selfishness, and pride, all attitudes of low favor in the outlook of the West, not because they are absolutely wrong but because they indicate a failure to see the place of things in the general structure of the universe. Even pride, either in Lucifer or in Soames Forsyte, is a failure to realize one's own position in the whole picture. And today, especially in America, increasing num- bers of people are trying to see the whole picture. The United States and the Middle-Class Crisis The character of any society is determined less by what it is actually like than bv the picture it has of itself and of what it aspires to be. From this point of view, American society of the 1910's was largely middle class. Its values and aspirations were middle class, and power or influ- ence within it was in the hands of middle-class people. On the whole, this was regarded as proper, except by iconoclastic writers who gained fortune and reputation simply by satirizing or criticizing middle-class customs. To be sure, even the most vigorous defenders of bourgeois America did not pretend that all Americans were middle class: only the more important ones were. But they did see the country as organized in mid- dle-class terms, and tliev looked forward to a not remote future in whic i everyone would be middle class, except for a small, shiftless minority or no importance. To these defenders, and probably also to the shiW ess minoritv, American society was regarded as a ladder of opportunity up which anyone could work his way, on rungs of increased affluence, t the supreme positions of wealth and power near the top. Wealth, power, prestige, and respect were all obtained by the same standard, based on money. This in turn was based on a pervasive emotional insecurity tlw sought relief in the ownership and control of material possessions. Tn_ e basis for this may be seen most clearly in the origins of this bourgeo' middle class.     .,     A thousand vears ago, Europe had a two-class society in which a snia upper class of nobles and upper clergy were supported by a great IB**"},{"pageNumber":1250,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  1235  of peasants. The nobles defended this world, and the clergy opened the way to the next world, while the peasants provided the food and other material needs for the whole society. All three had security in their so- cial relationships in that they occupied positions of social status that satis- fied their psychic needs for companionship, economic security, a forsee- ablc future, and purpose of their efforts. Members of both classes had little anxiety about loss of these things by any likely outcome of events, and all thus had emotional security. In the course of the medieval period, chiefly in the twelfth and thir- teenth centuries, this simple two-class society was modified by the intru- lson of a small, but distinctly different, new class between them. Because this new class was between, we call it middle class, just as we call it \"bourgeois\" (after bourg meaning town) from the fact that it resided in towns, a new kind of social aggregate. The two older, established, classes Were almost completely rural and intimately associated with the land, economically* socially, and spiritually. The permanence of the land and the intimate connection of the land with the most basic of human needs, especially food, amplified the emotional security associated with the older classes. The new middle class of bourgeoisie who grew up between the two older classes had none of these things. They were commercial peoples concerned with exchange of goods, mostly luxury goods, in a society where all their prospective customers already had the basic necessities of life provided by their status. The new middle class had no status in a society based on status; they had no security or permanence in a society that placed the highest value on these qualities. Thev had no law (since medieval law was largely past customs, and their activities were not cus- tomary ones) in a society that highly valued law. The flow of the neces- sities of life, notably food, to the new town dwellers was precarious, so that some of their earliest and most emphatic actions were taken to ensure the flow of such goods from the surrounding country to the town. All the things the bourgeois did were new things; all were precarious, and insecure; and their whole lives were lived without the status, permanence, and security the society of the day most highly valued. The risks (and rewards) of commercial enterprise, well reflected in the fluctuating for- tunes of figures such as Antonio in The Merchant of Venice, were ex- treme. A single venture could ruin a merchant or make him rich. This insecurity was increased by the fact that the prevalent religion of the day disapproved of what he was doing, seeking profits or taking interest, and could see no way of providing religious services to town dwellers because of the intimate association of the ecclesiastical system with the existing arrangement of rural landholding. For these and other reasons psvehic insecurity became the keynote <rf the new middle-class outlook. It still is. The only remedy for this"},{"pageNumber":1251,"pageContent":"1236  TRAGEDY AND HOPE insecurity of the middle class seemed to it to be the accumulation of more possessions that could be a demonstration to the world of the individual's importance and power. In this way, for the middle class, the general goal of medieval man to seek future salvation in the hereafter was secularized to an effort to seek future security in this world by acquisition of wealth and its accompanying power and social prestige. But the social prestige from wealth was most available among fellow bourgeoisie, rather than among nobles or peasants. Thus the opinions of one's fellow bourgeoisie, by wealth and by conformity to bourgeois values, became the motivating drives of the middle classes, creating what has been called the \"acquisitive society.\" In that society prudence, discretion, conformity, moderation (except in acquisition), decorum, frugality, became the marks of a sound man. Credit became more important than intrinsic personal qualities, and credit was based on the appearances of things, especially the appearances of the external material accessories of life. The facts of a man's personal qualities—such as kindness, affection, thoughtfulness, generosity, personal insight, and such, were increasingly irrelevant or even adverse to the middle-class evaluation of a man. Instead, the middle-class evaluation rested rather on nonpersonal attributes and on external accessories. Where personal qualities were admired, they were those that contributed to ac- quisition (often qualities opposed to the established values of the Chris- tian outlook, such as love, charity, generosity, gentleness, or unselfish- ness). These middle-class qualities included decisiveness, selfishness, impersonality, ruthless energy, and insatiable ambition. As the middle classes and their commercialization of all human rela- tionships spread through Western society in the centuries from the twelfth to the twentieth, they largely modified and, to some extent, reversed the values of Western society earlier. In some cases, the old values, such as future preference or self-discipline, remained, but were redirected. Future preference ceased to be transcendental in its aim, and became secularized. Self-discipline ceased to seek spirituality by restrain- ing sensuality, and instead sought material acquisition. In general, the new middle-class outlook had a considerable religious basis, but it was the religion of the medieval heresies and of puritanism rather than the religion of Roman Christianity. This complex outlook that we call middle class or bourgeois is, °* course, the chief basis of our world today. Western society is the richest and most powerful society that has ever existed largely because it has been impelled forward along these lines, beyond the rational degree nec- essary to satisfy human needs, by the irrational drive for achievement m u A terms of material ambitions.

There were always in our society dreamers and truth-seekers and tink- erers. They, as poets, scientists, and engineers, thought up innovations Which the middle classes adopted and exploited if they seemed likely to be profit-producing. .Middle-class self-discipline and future preference provided the savings and investment without which any innovation—no matter how appealing in theory—would be set aside and neglected. But the innovations that could attract middle-class approval (and exploita- tion) were the ones that made our world today so different from the world of our grandparents and ancestors. This middle-class character was imposed most strongly on the United States. In order to identify it and to discuss a very complex pattern of outlooks and values, we shall try to summarize it. At its basis is psychic insecurity founded on lack of secure social status. The cure for such in- security became insatiable material acquisition. From this flowed a large number of attributes of which we shall list only five: future preference, self-discipline, social conformity, infinitely expandable material demand, and a general emphasis on externalized, impersonal values. Those who have this outlook are middle class; those who lack it are something else. Thus middle-class status is a matter of outlook and not a matter of occupation or status. There can be middle-class clergy or teachers or scientists. Indeed, in the United States, most of these three groups are middle class, although their theoretical devotion to truth rather than to profit, or to others rather than to self, might seem to im- ply that they should not be middle class. And, indeed, they should not be; for the urge to seek truth or to help others are not really compatible with the middle-class values. But in our culture the latter have been so influential and pervasive, and the economic power of middle-class leaders has been so great, that many people whose occupations, on the face of it, should make them other than middle class, none the less have adopted major parts of the middle-class outlook and seek material success in re- ligion or teaching or science. The middle-class outlook, born in the Netherlands and northern Italy and other places in the medieval period, has been passed on by being inculcated to children as the proper attitude for them to emulate. It could pass on from generation to generation, and from century to cen- tury, as long as parents continued to believe it themselves and disciplined their children to accept it. The minority of children who did not accept it were \"disowned\" and fell out of the middle classes. What is even more important, they were, until recently, pitied and rejected by their families. In this way, those who accepted the outlook marched on in the steadily swelling ranks of the triumphant middle classes. Until the twentieth cen- tury. For more than half a century, from before World War I, the middle-"},{"pageNumber":1253,"pageContent":"U}8  TRAGEDY AND HOPE class outlook has been under relentless attack, often by its most ardent members, who heedlessly, and unknowingly, have undermined and de- stroyed many of the basic social customs that preserved it through earlier generations. Many of these changes occurred from changes in childrear- ing practices, and many arose from the very success of the middle-class way of life, which achieved material affluence that tended to weaken the older emphasis on self-discipline, saving, future preference, and the rest of it. One of the chief changes, fundamental to the survival of the middle- class outlook, was a change in our society's basic conception of human nature. This had two parts to it. The traditional Christian attitude toward human personality was that human nature was essentially good and that it was formed and modified by social pressures and training. The \"good- ness\" of human nature was based on the belief that it was a kind of weaker copy of God's nature, lacking many of God's qualities (in degree rather than in kind), but none the less perfectible, and perfectible largely by its own efforts with God's guidance. The Christian view of the uni- verse as a hierarchy of beings, with man about two-thirds of the way up, saw- these beings, especially man, as fundamentally free creatures able to move, at their own volition toward God or away from him, and guided or attracted in the correct direction for realization of their potentialities by God's presence at the top of the Universe, a presence which, like the north magnetic pole, attracted men, as compasses, upward toward fuller realization and knowledge of God who was the fulfillment of all good. Thus the effort came from free men, the guidance came from God's grace, and ultimately the motive power came from God's attrac- tiveness. In this Western point of view, evil and sin were negative qualities; they arose from the absence of good, not from the presence of evil. Thus sin was the failure to do the right thing, not doing the wrong thing (ex- cept indirectly and secondarily). In this view the devil, Lucifer, was not the epitome of positive wickedness, but was one of the highest of the angels, close to God in his rational nature, who fell because he failed to keep his perspective and believed that he was as good as God. In this Christian outlook, the chief task was to train men so that they would use their intrinsic freedom to do the right thing by following God's guidance. Opposed to this Western view of the world and the nature of man, there was, from the beginning, another opposed view of both which received its most explicit formulation by the Persian Zoroaster in the seventh century B.C. and came into the Western tradition as a minor, heretical, theme. It came in through the Persian influence on the He- brews, especially during the Babylonian Captivity of the Jews, in the sixth century B.C., and it came in, more fully, through the Greek ra-"},{"pageNumber":1254,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  I239  rionalist tradition from Pythagoras to Plato. This latter tradition encircled the early Christian religion, giving rise to many of the controversies that were settled in the early Church councils and continuing on in the manv heresies that extended through history from the Arians, the .Manichaeans, Luther, Calvin, and the Jansenists. The chief avenue by which these ideas, which were constantlv re- jected by the endless discussions formulating the doctrine of the West, continued to survive was through the influence of St. Augustine. From this dissident minority point of view came seventeenth-century Puritan- ism. The general distinction of this point of view from Zoroaster to Wil- liam Golding (in Lord of the Flies) is that the world and the flesh are positive evils and that man, in at least this phvsical part of his nature, is essentially evil. As a consequence he must be disciplined totallv to pre- vent him from destroving himself and the world. In this view the devil is a force, or being, of positive malevolence, and man, by himself, is in- capable of any good and is, accordinglv, not free.

The direc- tion and nature of the despotism is not regarded as important, since the reallv important thing is that man's innate destructiveness be controlled.

The puritan point of view, which had been struggling to take over Western Civilization for its first thousand years or more, almost did so in the seventeenth century. It was represented to varying degrees in the Work and agitations of Luther, Calvin, Thomas Hobbes, Cornelius Jansen {Atigtistimis, 1640), Antoine Arnauld (1612-1694), Blaise Pascal, and others. In general this point of view believed that the truth was to be found by rational deduction from a few basic revealed truths, in the way"},{"pageNumber":1255,"pageContent":"1240  TRAGEDY AND HOPE that Euclid's geometry and Descartes's analytical geometry were based on rational deduction from a few self-evident axioms. The result was a largely deterministic human situation, in sharp contrast with the ortho- dox point of view, still represented in the Anglican and Roman churches, which saw man as largely free in a universe whose rules were to be found most readilv by tradition and the general consensus. The Puritan point of view tended to support political despotism and to seek a one-class uniform societv, while the older view put much greater emphasis on tra- ditional pluralism and saw society as a unity of diversities. The newer idea led directly to mercantilism, which regarded political-economic life as a struggle to the death in a world where there was not sufficient wealth or space for different groups. To them wealth was limited to a fixed amount in the world as a whole, and one man's gain was someone else's loss. That meant that the basic struggles of this world were irrecon- cilable and must be fought to a finish. This was part of the Puritan belief that nature was evil and that a state of nature was a jungle of violent conflicts. Some of these ideas changed, others were retained, and a few were rearranged and modified in the following periods of the Enlightenment, the Romantic movement, and scientific materialism. All three of these returned to the older idea that man and nature were essentially good, and to this restored belief in the Garden of Eden thev joined a basically optimistic belief in man's ability to deal with his problems and to guide his own destinv. Society and its conventions came to be regarded as evil, and the guidance of traditions was generally rejected by the late Enlightenment and the early Romantics, although the excesses of the French Revolution drove many of the later Romantics back to rely on history and traditions because of their growing feeling of the inadequacy of human reason. One large change in all three periods was the Com- munity of Interests, which rejected mercantilism's insistence on limited wealth and the basic incompatibility of interests for the more optimistic belief that all parties could somehow adjust their interests within a com- munity in which all would benefit mutually. The application of Darwin- ism to human society changed this idea again, toward the end of the nineteenth century, and provided the ideological justification for the wars of extermination of Nazism and Fascism. Only after the middle 01 the twentieth century did a gradual reappearance of the old Christian ideas of love and charity modify this view, replacing it with the older idea that diverse human interests are basically reconcilable. All this shifting of ideas, many of them unstated, or even unconscious, assumptions, and the gradual growth of affluence helped to destroy mid- dle-class motivations and values. American society had been largely. t )U not entirely, middle class. Above the middle class, which dominated the country in the first half of the twentieth century, were a small group °"},{"pageNumber":1256,"pageContent":"JLHE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  1241  aristocrats. Below were the petty bourgeoisie, who had middle-class as- pirations, but were generally more insecure and often bitter because they did not obtain middle-class rewards. Below these two middle classes were two lower classes: the workers and the Lwnpenproletariat or so- cially disorganized, who had very little in common with each other. Outside this hierarchical structure of five groups in three classes (aris- tocrat, middle, and lower) were two other groupings that were not really part of the hierarchical structure. On the left were the intellec- tuals and on the right were the religious. These held in common the idea that the truth, to them, was more important than interests; but they differed greatly from the fact that the religious believed that they knew what the truth was, while the intellectuals were still seeking it. This whole arrangement was much more like a planetary arrangement of social-economic groupings than it was like the middle-class vision of society as a ladder of opportunity. The ladder really included only the middle classes with the workers below. The planetary view, becoming increasingly widespread, saw the middle classes in the center with the other five surrounding these. Social movement was possible in circular as well as in vertical directions (as the older ladder view of society be- lieved), so that sons of workers could rise into the middle classes or move right into the religious, left into the intelligentsia, or even fall downward into the declassed dregs. So too, in theory, the children (or more likely the grandchildren) of the upper middle class could move upward into the aristocracy, which could also be approached from the intellectuals or the religious. Strangely enough, the non-middle classes had more characteristics in common with each other than they did with the middle classes in their midst. The chief reason for this was that all other groups had value sys- tems different from the middle classes and, above all, placed no em- phasis on display of material affluence as proof of social status. From this came a number of somewhat similar qualities and attitudes that often gave the non-middle-class groups more in common and easier social in- tercourse than any of them had with the middle classes. For example, all placed much more emphasis on real personal qualities and much less on such things as clothing, residence, academic background, or kind of transportation used (all of which were important in determining middle- class reactions to people). In a sense all were more sincere, personally more secure (not the Lumpenproletariat), and less hypocritical than the middle class, and accordingly were much more inclined to judge any new acquaintance on his merits. Moreover, the middle classes, in order to provide their children with middle-class advantages, had few children, while the other groups placed little restriction on family size (except for some intellectuals). Thus aristocrats, religious, workers, the declassed, and many intellectuals had large families, while only the uppermost and"},{"pageNumber":1257,"pageContent":"1242  TRAGEDY AND HOPE most securely established middle-class families, as part of the transition to aristocracy, had larger families. Ideas of morality also tended to set the middle classes off from most of the others. The latter tended to regard morality in terms of honesty and integrity of character, while the middle classes based it on actions, especially sexual actions. Even the religious based sin to some extent on purpose, attitude, and mental context of the act rather than on the act itself, and did not restrict morality as narrowly to sexual behavior as did the middle classes. However, the middle-class influence has been so pervasive in the modern world that many of the other groups fell under its influence to the extent that the word \"morality,\" by the early twenti- eth century, came to mean sex. The Jansenist influence in American Roman Catholicism, for example, is so strong that sins concerning sex are widely regarded by Catholics as the worst of sins, in spite of the fact that Catholic doctrine continues to regard pride as the worst sin and sexual sins as much less important (as Dante did). At any rate, sex was generally regarded with greater indulgence by aristocrats, workers, in- tellectuals, or the declassed than by the middle classes or the more puri- tanical religious. In America, as elsewhere, aristocracy represents money and position grown old, and is organized in terms of families rather than of individuals. Traditionally it was made up of those whose families had had money, position, and social prestige for so long that they never had to think about these and, above all, never had to impress any other person with the fact that they had them. They accepted these attributes of family member- ship as a right and an obligation. Since they had no idea that these could be lost, they had a basic psychological security, similar to that of the religious and workers. Thus like these other two, they were self-assured, natural, but distant. Their manners were gracious but impersonal. Their chief characteristic was the assumption that their family position had obligations. This noblesse oblige led them to participate in school sports (even if they lacked obvious talent), to serve their university (usually a family tradition) in any helpful way (such as fund raising), to serve their church in a similar way, and to offer their services to their local community, their state, and their country as an obligation. They often scandalized their middle-class acquaintances by their unconventionally and social informality, greeting workers, recent immigrants, or even outcasts by their given names, arriving at evening meetings in tweeds, or traveling in cheap, small cars to formal weddings. The kind of a car a person drove was, until very recently, one of the best guides to middle-class status, since a car to the middle classes was a status symbol, while to the other classes it was a means of getting some- where.

Another good evidence of class may be seen in the treatment given to servants (or those who work in one's home): the lower classes treat these as equals, the middle classes treat them as inferiors, while aristocrats treat them as equals or even superiors. On the whole, the number of aristocratic families in the United States is very few, with a couple in each of the older states, especially New- England, and in the older areas of the South such as Charleston or Natchez, Mississippi, with the chief concentrations in the small towns around Boston and in the Hudson River Valley. Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt would be an example. A somewhat larger group of semiaristocrats con- sist of those like the Lodges, Rockefellers, or Kennedys who are not yet completely aristocratic either because they are not, in generations, far enough removed from money-making, or because of the persistence of a commercial or business tradition in the familv. But these are aristocrats in the sense that they have accepted a family obligation of service to the community. The significance of this aristocratic tradition may be seen in Massachusetts politics; there two decades ago, the governorship and both senatorial seats were held by a Bradford, a Saltonstall, and a Lodge, while in 1964 two of these positions were held by Endicott Peabody and Leverett Saltonstall. The working class in the United States is much smaller than we might assume, since most American workers are seeking to rise socially, to help their children to rise socially, and are considerably concerned with status svmbols. Such people, even if laborers, are not working class, but are rather pettv bourgeoisie. The real working class are rather relaxed, have present rather than future preference, generally worry very little about their status in the eves of the world, enjov their ordinary lives, including food, sex, and leisure, and have little desire to change their jobs or positions. They are generallv relaxed, have a taste for broad humor, are natural, direct, and friendly, without large basic insecurities of personality. The world depression, by destroying their jobs and eco- nomic securitv, much reduced this group, which was always propor- tionately smaller in America, the land of aspiration for everyone, than in Europe. The second most numerous group in the United States is the petty bourgeoisie, including millions of persons who regard themselves as middle class and are under all the middle-class anxieties and pressures, but often earn less money than unionized laborers. As a result of these things, they are often verv insecure, envious, filled with hatreds, and are generallv the chief recruits for anv Radical Right, Fascist, or hate cam- paigns against any group that is different or which refuses to conform to middle-class values.

They form the major portion of the Republican Party's supporters in the towns of America, as they did for the Nazis in Germany thirty years ago. In general, the political alignments in the United States have been in- fluenced even more by these class and psychological considerations than thev have been by income, economic, or occupational considerations. The Republican Party has been the party of the middle classes and the Democratic Partv has been the party of the rest. In general, aristocrats have tended to move toward the Democrats, while semiaristocrats often remain Republican (with their middle-class parents or grandparents), except where historical circumstance (chiefly in New England, the Mid- dle West, and the South, where Civil War memories remained green) operated. This meant that the Republican Party, whose nineteenth cen- tury superiority had been based on the division of farmers into South and West over the slave issue, became an established majority party in the twentieth century, but became, once again, a minority party, because of the disintegration of their middle-class support following 1945- Even in the period of middle-class dominance, the Republicans had lost control of the Federal government because of the narrowly pluto- cratic control of the party that split it in 1912 and alienated most of the rest of the country in 1932. Twenty years later, in 1952, the coun- try looked solidly middle class, but, in fact, by that date middle-class morale was almost totally destroyed, the middle classes themselves were in disintegration, and the majority of Americans were becoming less middle class in outlook. This change is one of the most significant trans- formations of the twentieth century. The future of the United States, of Western Civilization, and of the world depends on what kind of out- look replaces the dissolving middle-class ideology in the next generation. The weakening of this middle-class ideology was a chief cause of the panic of the middle classes, and especially of the petty bourgeoisie, in the Eisenhower era. The general himself was repelled by the Radical Right, whose impetus had been a chief element (but far from the most important element) in his election, although the lower-middle-class groups had preferred Senator Taft as their leader. Eisenhower, however, had been preferred by the Eastern Establishment of old Wall Street, Ivy League, semiaristocratic Anglophiles whose real strength rested in their control of eastern financial endowments, operating from foundations, academic halls, and other tax-exempt refuges. As we have said, this Eastern Establishment was really above parties and was much more concerned with policies than with party victories. They had been the dominant element in both parties since 1900, and practiced the political techniques of William C. Whitney and J. P-"},{"pageNumber":1260,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  1245  Morgan. They were, as we have said, Anglophile, cosmopolitan, Ivy League, internationalist, astonishinglv liberal, patrons of the arts, and relatively humanitarian. All these things made them anathema to the lower-middle-class and petty-bourgeois groups, chiefly in small towns and in the Middle West, who supplied the votes in Republican electoral victories, but found it so difficult to control nominations (especially in presidential elections) because the big money necessary for nominating in a Republican National Convention was allied to Wall Street and to the Eastern Establishment. The ability of the latter to nominate Eisen- hower over Taft in 1952 was a bitter pill to the radical bourgeoisie, and was not coated sufficiently by the naming of Nixon, a man much closer to their hearts, for the vice-presidential post. The split between these two wings of the Republican Party, and Eisenhower's preference for the upper bourgeois rather than for the petty-bourgeois wing, paralyzed both of his administrations and was the significant element in Kennedy's narrow victory over Nixon in i960 and in Johnson's much more decisive victory over Goldwater in 1964. Kennedv, despite his Irish Catholicism, was an Establishment figure. This did not arise from his semiaristocratic attitudes or his Harvard con- nections (which were always tenuous, since Irish Catholicism is not yet completely acceptable at Harvard). These helped, but John Kennedy's introduction to the Establishment arose from his support of Britain, in opposition to his father, in the critical days at the American Embassy in London in 1938-1940. His acceptance into the English Establishment opened its American branch as well. The former was indicated by a num- ber of events, such as sister Kathleen's marriage to the Marquis of Harr- ington and the shifting of Caroline's nursery school from the White House to the British Embassy after her father's assassination. (The am- bassador, Ormsby-Gore, fifth Baron Harlech, was the son of an old associate of Lord Milner and Leo Amery, when they were the active core of the British-American Atlantic Establishment.) Another indication of this connection was the large number of Oxford-trained men ap- pointed to office by President Kennedy. The period since 1950 has seen the beginnings of a revolutionary change in American politics. This change is not so closely related to the changes in American economic life as it is to the transformation in social life. But without the changes in economic life, the social influences could not have operated. What has been happening has been a disintegration of the middle class and a corresponding increase in significance by the petty bourgeoisie at the same time that the economic influence of the older Wall Street financial groups has been weakening and been chal- lenged by new wealth springing up outside the eastern cities, notably in the Southwest and Far West. These new sources of wealth have been based very largely on government action and government spending but"},{"pageNumber":1261,"pageContent":"I246  TRAGEDY AND HOPE have, none the less, adopted a petty-bourgeois outlook rather than the semiaristocratic outlook that pervades the Eastern Establishment. This new wealth, based on petroleum, natural gas, ruthless exploitation of na- tional resources, the aviation industry, military bases in the South and West, and finally on space with all its attendant activities, has centered in Texas and southern California. Its existence, for the first time, made it possible for the petty-bourgeois outlook to make itself felt in the po- litical nomination process instead of in the unrewarding effort to influ- ence politics by voting for a Republican candidate nominated under Eastern Establishment influence. In these terms the political struggle in the United States has shifted in two ways, or even three. This struggle, in the minds of the ill in- formed, had always been viewed as a struggle between Republicans and Democrats at the ballot box in November. Wall Street, long ago, how- ever, had seen that the real struggle was in the nominating conventions the preceding summer. This realization was forced upon the petty- bourgeois supporters of Republican candidates by their antipathy for Willkie, Dewey, Eisenhower, and other Wall Street interventionists and their inability to nominate their congressional favorites, like Senators Knouland, Bricker, and Taft, at national party conventions. Just as these disgruntled voters reached this conclusion, with Taft's failure in 1952, the new wealth appeared in the political picture, sharing the petty bour- geoisie's suspicions of the East, big cities, Ivy League universities, for- eigners, intellectuals, workers, and aristocrats. By the 1964 election, the major political issue in the country was the financial struggle behind the scenes between the old wealth, civilized and cultured in foundations, and the new wealth, virile and uninformed, arising from the flowing profits of government-dependent corporations in the Southwest and West. At issue here was the whole future face of America, for the older wealth stood for values and aims close to the Western traditions or diversity, tolerance, human rights and values, freedom, and the rest of it- while the newer wealth stood for the narrow and fear-racked aims q petty-bourgeois insecurity and egocentricity. The nominal issues between them, such as that between internationalism and unilateral isolationism (which its supporters preferred to rename \"nationalism\"), were less fundamental than they seemed, for the real issue was the control of the Federal government's tremendous power to influence the future of Am er \" ica by spending of government funds. The petty bourgeois and tiew- wealth groups wanted to continue that spending into the indusrm military complex, such as defense and space, while the older wea r and nonbourgeois groups wanted to direct it toward social diversity an social amelioration for the aged and the young, for education, for socia outcasts, and for protecting national resources for future use."},{"pageNumber":1262,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IX PERSPECTIVE  1247  The outcome of this struggle, which still goes on, is one in which civilized people can afford to be optimistic. For the newer wealth is unbelievably ignorant and misinformed. In their growing concern to con- trol political nominations, they ignored the even greater need to win elections. They did not realize that the disintegration of the middle classes, chiefly from the abandonment of the middle-class outlook, was creating an American electorate that would never elect any candidate the newer wealth would care to nominate. As part of this lack of vision, the new wealth and its pettv-bourgeois supporters ignored the well- established principle that a national candidate must have a national appeal and that this is obtained best by a candidate close to the center. In American politics we have several parties included under the blanket words \"Democratic\" and \"Republican.\" In oversimplified terms, as I have said, the Republicans were the partv of the middle classes, and the Democrats were the party of the fringes. Both of these were subdivided, each with a Congressional and a National Party wing. The Republican Congressional Party (representing localism) was much farther to the Right than the National Republican Partv, and as such was closer to the petty-bourgeois than to the upper-middle-class outlook. The Democratic Congressional Party was much more clearly of the fringes and minori- ties (and thus often further to the Left) than the Democratic National Party. The party machinery in each case was in Congressional Party control during the intervals between the quadrennial presidential elec- tions, but, in order to win these elections, each had to call into existence, in presidential election years, its shadowy National Party. This meant that the Republicans had to appear to move to the Left, closer to the Center, while the Democrats had also to move from the fringes toward the Center, usually by moving to the Right. As a result, the National parties and their presidential candidates, with the Eastern Establishment assiduously fostering the process behind the scenes, moved closer together and nearly met in the center with almost identical candidates and plat- forms, although the process was concealed, as much as possible, by the revival of obsolescent or meaningless war cries and slogans (often going back to the Civil War). As soon as the presidential election was over, the two National parties vanished, and party controls fell back into the hands of the Congressional parties, leaving the newly elected President in a precarious position between the two Congressional parties, neither of which was very close to the brief National coalition that had elected him. The chief problem of American political life for a long time has been how to make the two Congressional parties more national and interna- tional. The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies, one, perhaps, of the Right and the other of the Left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to doctrinaire and academic thinkers. Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so that the American people"},{"pageNumber":1263,"pageContent":"1248  TRAGEDY AND HOPE can \"throw the rascals out\" at any election without leading to any pro- found or extensive shifts in policy. The policies that are vital and neces- sary for America are no longer subjects of significant disagreement, but are disputable only in details of procedure, priority, or method: we must remain strong, continue to function as a great world Power in cooperation with other Powers, avoid high-level war, keep the economy moving without significant slump, help other countries do the same, provide the basic social necessities for all our citizens, open up opportunities for social shifts for those willing to work to achieve them, and defend the basic Western outlook of diversity, pluralism, cooperation, and the rest of it, as already described. These things any national American party hoping to win a presidential election must accept. But either party in office becomes in time corrupt, tired, unenterprising, and vigorless. Then it should be possible to replace it, every four years if necessary, by the other party, which will be none of these things but will still pursue, with new vigor, approximately the same basic policies. The capture of the Republican National Party by the extremist ele- ments of the Republican Congressional Party in 1964, and their effort to elect Barry Goldwater to the Presidency with the petty-bourgeois extremists alone, was only a temporary aberration on the American politi- cal scene, and arose from the fact that President Johnson had preempted all the issues (which are, as we have said, now acceptable to the over- whelming majority) and had occupied the whole broad center of the American political spectrum, so that it was hardly worth while for the Republicans to run a real contestant against him in the same area. Thus Goldwater was able to take control of the Republican National Party by default. The virulence behind the Goldwater campaign, however, had nothing to do with default or lack of intensity. Quite the contrary. His most ardent supporters were of the extremist petty-bourgeois mentality driven to near hysteria by the disintegration of the middle classes and the steady rise in prominence of everything they considered anathema: Catholics, Negroes, immigrants, intellectuals, aristocrats (and near aristocrats), scientists, and educated men generally, people from big cities or from the East, cosmopolitans and internationalists and, above all, liberals who accept diversity as a virtue. This disintegration of the middle classes had a variety of causes, some of them intrinsic, many of them accidental, a few of them obvious, but many of them going deeply into the very depths of social existence. All these causes acted to destroy the middle classes by acting to destroy the middle-class outlook. And this outlook was destroyed, not by adult middle-class persons abandoning it, but by a failure or inability of parents to pass it on to their children. Moreover, this failure was largely re- stricted to the middle class itself and not to the petty bourgeoisie (lower"},{"pageNumber":1264,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  I249  middle class), which, if anything, was clinging to its particular version of the middle-class outlook more tenaciously and was passing it on to its offspring in an even more intensified form. What I am saving here is that the disintegration of the middle class arose from a failure to transfer its outlook to its children. This failure was thus a failure of education, and may seem, at first glance, to be all the more surprising, since our education system has been, consciously or un- consciously, organized as a mechanism for indoctrination of the young in middle-class ideologv. In fact, rather surprisingly, it would appear that our educational svstem, unlike those of continental Europe, has been more concerned with indoctrination of middle-class outlook than with teaching patriotism or nationalism. As a reflection of this, it has been more con- cerned with instilling attitudes and behavior than with intellectual train- ing. In view of the fact that the American ideals of the 1920's were as much middle class as patriotic, with the so-called \"American way of life\" identified rather With the American economic and social system than with the American political system, and the fact that a majority of schoolchildren were not from middle-class families, it is not surprising that the educational svstem was devoted to training in the middle-class outlook. Children of racial, religious, national, and class minorities all passed through the same system and received the middle-class formative process, with, it must be recognized, incomplete success in many cases. This refers to the public schools, but the Roman Catholic school system, especially on its upper levels, was doing the same things. The large num- ber of Catholic men's colleges in the country, especially those operated by the Jesuits, had as their basic, if often unrecognized, aim the desire to transform the sons of working class, and often of immigrant, origins into middle-class people in professional occupations (chiefly law, medi- cine, business, and teaching). On the whole, this system was, until recently, a success, but is now becoming less and less successful in turning out middle-class people, especially from its upper educational levels. This failure can be attributed rather to the context within which the educational system has operated than to a failure of the system itself. As we shall see in a moment, this failure occurred chieflv within the middle-class family, a not unexpected situation, since outlook is still determined rather by reaction to family conditions than by submission to a formal educational process. Aluch of the d isintegration of the middle-class outlook can be traced to a weakening of its chief aspects, such as future preference, intense self- discipline, and, to a lesser degree, to a decreasing enmhasis on infinitely expandable material demand and on the imnortance of middle-class status symbols. Only a few of the factors that have influenced these changes can be mentioned here. The chief external factor in the destruction of the middle-class our-"},{"pageNumber":1265,"pageContent":"I2jO  TRAGEDY AND HOPE look has been the relentless attack upon it in literature and drama through most of the twentieth century. In fact, it is difficult to find works that defended this outlook or even assumed it to be true, as was frequent in the nineteenth century. Not that such works did not exist in recent years; they have existed in great numbers, and have been avidly welcomed by the petty bourgeoisie and by some middle-class housewives. Lending libraries and women's magazines of the IQIO'S, 1920's, and 1930's were full of them, but, by the io5o's they were largely restricted to television soap dramas. Even those writers who explicitly accepted the middle-class ideology, like Booth Tarkington, Ben Ames Williams, Sloan Wilson, or John O'Hara, tended to portray middle-class life as a horror of false values, hypocrisy, meaningless effort, and insecurity. In Alice Adams, for example, Tarkington portrayed a lower-middle-class girl, filled with hypocrisy and materialistic values, desperately seeking a husband who would provide her with the higher social status for which she yearned. In the earlier period, even down to 1940, literature's attack on the mid- dle-class outlook was direct and brutal, from such works as Upton Sin- clair's The jungle or Frank Morris's The Pit, both dealing with the total corruption of personal integrity in the meatpacking and wheat markets. These early assaults were aimed at the commercialization of life under bourgeois influence and were fundamentally reformist in outlook because they assumed that the evils of the system could somehow be removed, perhaps by state intervention. By the 1920's the attack was much more total, and saw the problem in moral terms so fundamental that no remedial action was possible. Only complete rejection of middle-class values could remove the corruption of human life seen by Sinclair Lewis in Babbitt or Main Street. After 1940, writers tended less and less to attack the bourgeois way of life; that job had been done. Instead they described situations, characters, and actions that were simply nonbourgeois: violence, social irresponsi- bility, sexual laxity and perversion, miscegenation, human weakness in relation to alcohol, narcotics, or sex, or domestic and business relationships conducted along completely nonbourgeois lines. Ernest Hemingway, Wil- liam Faulkner, Erskine Caldwell, John Dos Passos, and a host of lesser writers, many of them embracing the cult of violence, showed the trend. A verv popular work like The Lost Weekend could represent the whole group. A few, like Hemingway, found a new moral outlook to replace the middle-class ideology they had abandoned. In Hemingway's case he shook the dust of upper-middle-class Oak Park, Illinois, off his feet and im- mersed himself in the tragic sense of life of Spain with its constant demand upon men to demonstrate their virility by incidental activity with women and unflinching courage in facing death. To Hemingway this could be achieved in the bullring, in African big-game hunting, in war or, in a more symbolic way, in prizefighting or crime. The significant point here"},{"pageNumber":1266,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  I 25 I is that Hemingway's embrace of the outlook of the Pakistani-Peruvian axis as a token of his rejection of his middle-class background was always recognized by him as a pretense, and, when his virility, in the crudest sense, was gone, he blew out his brains. The literarv assault on the bourgeois outlook was directed at all the aspects of it that we have mentioned, at future preference, at self-disci- pline, at the emphasis on materialistic acquisition, at status symbols. The attack on future preference appeared as a demonstration that the future is never reached. Its argument was that the individual who constantly postpones living from the present (with living taken to mean real per- sonal relationships with individuals) to a hypothetical future eventually finds that the years have gone by, death is approaching, he has not yet lived, and is, in most cases, no longer able to do so. If the central figure in such a work has achieved his materialist ambitions, the implication is that these achievements, which looked so attractive from a distance, are but encumbrances to the real values of personal living when achieved. This theme, which goes back at least to Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol or to George Eliot's Silas Marner, continued to be presented into the twentieth century. It often took the form, in more recent times, of a rejection of a man's whole life achievement by his sons, his wife, or himself. The more recent form of this attack on future preference has appeared in the existentialist novel and the theater of the absurd. Existentialism, by its belief that reality and life consist only of the specific, concrete per- sonal experience of a given place and moment, ignores the context of each event and thus isolates it. But an event without context has no cause, meaning, or consequence; it is absurd, as anything is which has no relation- ship to anv context. And such an event, with neither past nor future, can have no connection with tradition or with future preference. This point of view came to saturate twentieth-century literature so that the original rejection of future preference was expanded into total rejection of time, which was portrayed as simply a mechanism for enslaving man and depriving him of the opportunity to experience life. The writings of Thomas Wolfe and, on a higher level, of the earlv Dos Passos, were devoted to this theme. The bourgeois time clock became a tomb or prison that alienated man from life and left him a cipher, like the appropriately named .Mr. Zero in Elmer Rice's play The Adding Machine (1923). A similar attack was made on self-discipline. The philosophic basis for this attack was found in an oversimplified Frcudianism that regarded all suppression of human impulse as leading to frustration and psychic dis- tortions that made subsequent life unattainable. Thus novel after novel or plav after play portrayed the wickedness of the suppression of good, healthy\", natural impulse and the salutary consequences of self-indulgence, especially in sex. Adultery and other manifestations of undisciplined"},{"pageNumber":1267,"pageContent":"1252  TRAGEDY AND HOPE sexuality -were described in increasingly clinical detail and were generally associated with excessive drinking or other evasions of personal re- sponsibility, as in Hemingway's A Farewell to Anns and The Sun Also Rises or in John Steinbeck's love affair with personal irresponsibility in Cannery Row or Tortilla Flat. The total rejection of middle-class values, including time, self-discipline, and material achievement, in favor of a cult of personal violence was to be found in a multitude of literary works from James M. Cain and Raymond Chandler to the more recent antics of James Bond. The result has been a total reversal of middle-class values by presenting as interesting or admirable simple negation of these values by aimless, shiftless, and totally irresponsible people. A similar reversal of values has flooded the market with novels filled with pointless clinical descriptions, presented in obscene language and in fictional form, of swamps of perversions ranging from homosexuality, in- cest, sadism, and masochism, to cannibalism, necrophilia, and coprophagia. These performances, as the critic Edmund Fuller has said, represent not so much a loss of values as a loss of any conception of the nature of man. Instead of seeing man the way the tradition of the Greeks and of the West regarded him, as a creature midway between animal and God, \"a little lower than the angels,\" and thus capable of an infinite variety of experience, these twentieth-century writers have completed the revolt against the middle classes by moving downward from the late nineteenth century's view of man as simply a higher animal to their own view of man as lower than any animal would naturally descend. From this has emerged the Puritan view of man (but without the Puritan view of God) as a creature of total depravity in a deterministic universe without hope of any redemption. This point of view, which, in the period 1550-1650, justified despotism in a Puritan context, now may be used, with petty-bourgeois support, to justify a new despotism to preserve, by force instead of conviction, petty-bourgeois values in a system of compulsory conformity. George Orwell's 1984 has given us the picture of this system as Hitler's Germany showed us its practical operation. But in view of the present upsurge of nonbourgeois social groups and social pressures, this possibility be- comes decreasingly likely, and Barry Goldwater's defeat in the presiden- tial election of 1964 moved the possibility so far into the future that the steady change in social conditions makes it remote indeed. The destruction of the middle classes by the destruction of the middle- class outlook was brought about to a much greater degree by internal than by external forces. And the most significant of these influences have been operating within the middle-class family. One of the most obvious of these has been the growing affluence of American society, which re- moved the pressure of want from the childbearing process. The child who grows up in affluence is more difficult to instill with the frustrations"},{"pageNumber":1268,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IX PERSPECTIVE  I253  and drives that were so basic in the middle-class outlook. For generations, even in fairly rich families, this indoctrination had continued because of continued emphasis on thrift and restraints on consumption. By 1937 the world depression showed that the basic economic problems were not saving and investment, but distribution and consumption. Thus there ap- peared a growing readiness to consume, spurred on by new sales tech- niques, installment selling, and the extension of credit from the productive side to the consumption side of the economic process. As a result, an entirely new phenomenon appeared in middle-class families, the practice of living up to, or even bevond, their incomes—an unthinkable scandal in any nineteenth-century bourgeois family. One incentive in this direc- tion was the increased emphasis, within the middle-class ideology, upon the elements of status and ostentatious display of wealth as status sym- bols rather than on the elements of frugality and prudence. Thus af- fluence weakened both future preference and self-denying self-discipline training. Somewhat related to this was the influence of the depression of 1929- 1933. The generation that was entering manhood at that time (having been born in the period 1905-1915) felt that their efforts to fulfill their middle-class ambitions had involved them in intensive hardships and suf- fering, such as working while going to college, doing without leisure, cultural expansion, and travel, and by the 1950's these were determined that their children must never have it as hard as they had had it. They rarely saw that their efforts to make things easy for their children in the 1950's as a reaction against the hardships they had suffered themselves in the 1930's were removing from their children's training process the difficulties that had helped to make them achieving men and successful middle-class persons and that their efforts to do this were weakening the moral fiber of their children. Another element in this process was a change in the educational philoso- phy of America and a somewhat similar change in the country's ideas on the whole process of child training. Early generations had continued to cling to the vestiges of the Puritan outlook to the degree that they in- sisted that children must be trained under strict discipline, including corporal punishment. This seventeenth-century idea, by 1920, was being replaced in American family ideology bv an idea of the nineteenth cen- tury that child maturation is an innate process not subject to modification by outside training. In educational theory this erroneous idea went back to the Emile of Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1762), which idealized the state of nature as equivalent to the Garden of Eden, and believed that education must consist in leaving a youth completely free so that his innate good- ness could emerge and reveal itself. This idea was developed, intensified, and given a pseudoscientific foundation by advances in biology and genetics in the late nineteenth century. By 1910 or so, childrearing and"},{"pageNumber":1269,"pageContent":"1254  TRAGEDY AXD HOPE educational theories had accepted the idea that man was a biological organism, like any animal, that his personality was a consequence of hereditary traits, and that each child had within him a rigid assortment of inherited talents and a natural rate of maturation in the development • of these talents. These ideas were incorporated in a series of slogans of which two were: \"Every child is different,\" and \"He'll do it when he's ready.\" From all this came a wholesale ending of discipline, both in the home and in school, and the advent of \"permissive education,\" with all that it entailed. Children were encouraged to have opinions and to speak out on matters of which they were totallv ignorant; acquisition of information and intellectual training were shoved into the background; and restric- tions of time, place, and movement in schools and homes were reduced to a minimum. Everv emphasis was placed on \"spontaneity\"; and fixed sched- ules of time periods or subject matter to be covered were belittled. All this greatly weakened the disciplinary influence of the educational process, leaving the new generation much less disciplined, less organized, and less aware of time than their parents. Naturally this disintegrative process was less evident among the children of the petty bourgeois than in the middle class itself. These influences in themselves would have contributed much to the weakening of the middle-class outlook among the rising generation, but other, much more profound, influences were also operating. To examine these we must look inside the middle-class family structure. In marriage, as in so many other things, Western Civilization has been subjected to quite antithetical theories; these we might call the Western and the Romantic theories of love and marriage. The Romantic theory of these things was that each man or woman had a unique personality con- sisting of inborn traits, accumulated by inheritance from a unique com- bination of ancestors. This is, of course, the same theory that was used to justify permissive education. In Romantic love, however, the theory went on to assume, simply as a matter of faith, that for each man or woman there existed in a world a person of the opposite sex whose personality traits would just fit into those of his or her destined mate. The only problem was to find that mate. It was assumed that this would be done, at first sight, when an almost instantaneous flash of recognition woulu reveal to both that thev had found the one possible life's partner. The idea of love at first sight as a flash of recognition was closely i* e ~ lated to the Alanichacan and Puritan religious idea that God's truth came to men in a similar flash of illumination (an idea that goes back, like so manv of these ideas, to Plato's theory of knowledge as reminiscence)' In its most extreme form, this Romantic theory of love assumed that each of the destined lovers was only part of a person, the two parts fitting t0 ~ gether instantly on meeting into a single personality. Associated with t' llS were a number of other ideas, including the idea that marriages w' cre"},{"pageNumber":1270,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IX PERSPECTIVE  1255  \"made in heaven,\" that such a Romantic marriage was totally satisfying to the partners, and that such a marriage should be \"eternal.\" These ideas of Romantic love and marriage were much more acceptable to women than to men (for reasons we have not time to analyze) and were embraced by the middle class, but not, to anv great extent, by other classes. The theory, like so much of the middle-class outlook, originated among the medieval heresies, such as Alanichaeism (as the Swiss writer Denis de Rougemont has shown), and was thus from the same tradition that saw the rise of the bourgeois outlook in the Middle Ages and its rein- forcement by the closely associated Puritan movement of modern times. The Romantic theory of love was spread through the middle class by incidental factors, such as that the bourgeoisie were the only social class that read much, and Romantic love was basically a literary convention in its propagation whatever it may have been in its origins. It made no real impression on the other social classes in European society, such as the peasants, the nobility, or the urban working craftsmen. Strangely enough, Romantic love, accepted as a theory and ideal by the bourgeoisie, had little influence on middle-class marriages in practice, since these were usually based on middle-class values of economic security and material status rather than on love. More accurately, middle- class marriages were based on these material considerations in fact, while everyone concerned pretended that they were based on Romantic love. Any subsequent recognition of this clash between fact and theory often gave a severe jolt and has sometimes been a subject for literary exami- nation, as in the first volume of John Galsworthy's The Forsyte Saga. Opposed to this Romantic theory of love and marriage, and almost equally opposed to the bourgeois practice of \"sensible\" marriage, was what we may call the Western idea of love and marriage. This assumes that personalities are dynamic and flexible things formed largely by ex- periences in the past. Love and marriage between such personalities are, like everything in the Western outlook, diverse, imperfect, adjustable, creative, cooperative, and changeable. The Western idea assumes that a couple come together for many reasons (sex, loneliness, common interests, similar background, economic and social cooperation, reciprocal ad- miration of character traits, and other reasons). It further assumes that their whole relationship will be a slow process of getting to know each other and of mutual adjustment—a process that may never end. The need for constant adjustment shows the Western recognition that nothing, even love, is final or perfect. This is also shown by recognition that love and marriage are never total and all-absorbing, that each partner remains an independent personality with the right to an independent life. (This is found throughout the Western tradition and goes back to the Christian belief that each person is a separate soul with its own, ultimately separate, fate.)"},{"pageNumber":1271,"pageContent":"1256  TRAGEDY AND HOPE Thus there appeared in Western society at least three kinds of mar- riage, which we may call Romantic, bourgeois, and Western. The last, without being much discussed (except in modern books on love and mar- riage), is probably the most numerous of the three, and the other two, if they prove successful, do so by gradually developing into this third kind. Romantic marriage, based on the \"shock of recognition,\" has in fact come to be based very largely on sexual attraction, since this is the chief form that love at first sight can take. Such marriages often fail, since even sex requires practice and mutual adjustment and is too momentary a human relationship to sustain a permanent union unless many other common interests accumulate around it. Even when this occurs and the marriage becomes a success, in the sense that it persists, it is never total, and the Romantic delusion that marriage should be totally absorbing of the time, attention, and energies of its partners, still expected by many women brought up on the Romantic idea, merely means that the marriage becomes an enslaving relationship to the husbands and a source of disappointment and frustration to the wives. Middle-class marriage, in fact, was not romantic, for, in the middle class, marriage, like everything else, was subject to the middle-class sys- tem of values. Within that value system, middle-class persons chose a marriage partner who would assist in achieving middle-class goals of status and achievement. A woman, with her parents' approval, chose a husband who showed promise of being a good provider and a steady, re- liable, social achiever, who would be able to give her a material status at least as high as that provided by her own parents. A man chose a s a wife one who showed promise of being a help in his upward struggle one able to act as hostess to his aspirant activities and to provide the domestic decorum and social graces expected of a successful business or professional man. Such a marriage was based, from both sides, on status factors rather than on personal factors. The fact that a man was a Yale graduate, was trained for a profession, had a position with a good firm, drove an ex- pensive car, could order dinner with assurance in an expensive restaurant, and had alreadv applied for membership in a golf or country club were not reasons for loving him as a person, since they were simply the acces- sories of his status. Yet middle-class persons married for reasons such as these and, at the same time, convinced themselves and their friends that they were marrying for Romantic love (based on the fact that they were, in addition to their mutual social acceptability, sexually at- tracted). For a time the new marriage could keep up these pretenses, especially as the elements of sex and novelty in the relationship helped conceal the contrast between theory and fact and that the marriage was basically an external and superficial relationship. But this fact remained, and in time"},{"pageNumber":1272,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  1257  unconscious frustrations and dissatisfactions began to operate. Often these did not reach the conscious level, especially a few generations ago, but today the question is posed by every women's magazine, \"Is your mar- riage a success?\" But unconsciously, long before this, realization had been growing that the marriage relationship was not based on love, which must be a recognition and appreciation of personal qualities, not of status ac- cessories. Without personal feeling based on such personal qualities, the relationship was really not a personal relationship and was really not based on love, even when the partners, with the usual lack of introspection as- sociated with middle-class minds, still insisted that it was based on love. The consequences of such unconscious recognition of the real lack of love in the bourgeois marital relationship, in a society that never stopped reiterating in song, cinema, magazine, and book the absolute necessity of love for human happiness and \"fulfillment,\" will be examined in a moment. Three generations ago the bourgeois wife rarely became aware of her frustrations. She was largely confined to her home, was kept too busy with children and housework to find much time for meditation on her situation or for comparison with other wives or the outside world generally. Brought up in a male-dominated family, she was prepared to accept a similar situation in her own life. This means that her outside contacts and her general picture of the world came to her through the screen of her husband's vision of these things. The decrease in the number of children in middle-class families and the spread of labor-saving devices, from vacuum cleaners to frozen foods, gave the bourgeois wife increasing leisure in the 1920's and 1930's. Enterprising editors like Edwin Bok filled that leisure with new slick women's magazines (like the Ladies' Home ]ournal). Popular novels and, to a lesser extent, the early movies, dramatic matinees, and spread- ing women's clubs allowed women to build up a vision of a fantasy world of romantic love and carefree, middle-class housewives with dazzling homes and well-behaved and well-scrubbed children. By 1925 the average bourgeois housewife was becoming increasingly frustrated because her own life was not that pictured in the women's magazines. Her increasing leisure gave her time to think about it, and her more frequent contact with other wives encouraged her to raise her voice in criticism of her husband whose financial inability to provide her with the life she came to regard as her due seemed to her to justify her desire to nag him on- ward to greater effort in pursuit of money. To him this became nagging; to her it was only an occasional reminder of the expectations under which she had entered upon the marriage relationship. While tin's was going on, the outside world was also changing. Women became \"emancipated\" as a consequence of World War I, with consid- erable urging onward from the women's magazines. Shorter skirts and"},{"pageNumber":1273,"pageContent":"1258  TRAGEDY AND HOPE shorter hair became symbols of this process, but even more significant was the appearance in the outside world of a great increase in the number of jobs that could be done best, or only; by women. As part of this process, there took place considerable changes in bourgeois morality, the ending of chaperonage, greater freedom between the sexes, and the acceptance of divorce as morally possible in bourgeois life (a custom that came in from the stage and cinema). As part of this whole process, there occurred a dramatic event of great social significance. This was the reversal in longevity expectations of men and women in adult life. A century ago (to be sure, in a largely rural context), a twenty-year-old man could expect to live longer than a twenty-year-old wife. In fact, such a man might well bury two or three wives, usually from the mortality associated with childbirth or other female problems. Today, a twentv-vear-old man has little expectation of living as long as a twenty-year-old woman. To make matters worse, a twenty-year-old woman a century ago married a man considerably older than herself, at least in the middle classes, simply because future prefer- ence required that a man be established economically before he began to raise a family. Today, from a series of causes, such as the extension of the female expectation of life faster than the male expectation, the increased prac- tice of birth control, coeducation (which brings the sexes into contact at the same age), weakening of future preference and of the middle-class outlook generally, which leads to marriages by couples of about the same age, husbands now generally die before their wives. Recognition of this, the increased independence of women, adaptation to taxes and other legal nuisances, has given rise to joint financial accounts, to property being put in the wife's name, and to greatly increased insurance benefits for wives. Gradually the wealth of the country became female-owned, even if still largely male-controlled. But this had subtle results; it made women more independent and more outspoken. Bourgeois men gradually came to live under a regime of per- sistent nagging to become \"better providers.\" To many men, work be- came a refuge and a relief from domestic revelations of the inadequacy of their performance as economic achievers. This growth of overwork, of constant tension, of frustration of emotional life and of leisure began to make more and more men increasingly willing to accept death as the only method of achieving rest. Bourgeois men literally began to kill them- selves, bv unconscious psychic suicide, from overwork, neurotic over- indulgence in alcohol, smoking, work, and violent leisure, and the middle class slowly increased its proportion of materially endowed widows. One notable change in this whole process was a shift, over the past cen- tury, from the male-dominated family to a female-dominated family. The locality in which the young couple set up their home had an increasing tendency to be matrilocal rather than patrilocal. In increasing numbers"},{"pageNumber":1274,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  I259  of cases, where the young couple married before the groom's educational process was finished, they even lived with her familv (but verv rarely vvith his family). Increasingly part of the burden of housework was shifted to the husband: washing dishes, buying groceries, even tending the children. In 1840 a child could crv at night and would invariably be tended by its mother, while the father slept peacefully on, totally unaware of what was going on. By i960, if a child cried at night, the chances were as likely as not that the mother would hear nothing while the father took over the necessary activities. If this were questioned by anyone, the mother's retort was pointed: \"I take care of baby all dav; I don't see why he can't take care of it at night!\" Closely related to this confusion, or even reversal, of the social roles of the sexes was decreasing sexual differentiation in child-rearing prac- tices. As recently as the 1920's girl babies were reared differently from boys. They were dressed differently, treated differently, permitted to do different things, and admonished about different dangers. By i960, chil- dren, regardless of sex, were all being brought up the same. Indeed, with short cropped hair and plavsuits on both, it became impossible to be sure which was which. This led to a decrease in the personality dif- ferences of men and women, with males becoming more submissive and females more aggressive. This tendency was accelerated by new techniques of education, espe- cially in the first twelve vears of life. The neurological maturation of girls was faster than that of boys, especially in regard to coordination, such as in feeding oneself, talking, dressing oneself, toilet-training, learning to read, and general adjustment to school. The shift from home to school in the early grades was adjusted to by girls more easily than by boys, partly because girls were more self-assured and gregarious. By the age of ten or twelve, girls were developed physically, neurologi- cally, emotionallv, and socially about two years in advance of boys. All this tended to make boys less self-assured, indecisive, weak, and de- pendent. The steady increase in the percentage of women teachers in the lower grades worked in the same direction, since women teachers favored girls and praised those attitudes and techniques that were more natural to girls. New methods, such as the w hole-word method of teach- ing reading or the use of true-and-falsc or multiple-choice examinations, were also better adapted to female than to masculine talents. Less and less emphasis was placed on critical judgment, while more and more was placed on intuitive or subjective decisions. In this environment girls did better, and boys felt inferior or decided that school was a place for girls and not for boys. The growing aggressiveness of girls pushed these hesitant boys aside and intensified the problem. As consequences of this, boys had twice as manv \"nonreadcrs\" as girls, several times as many stutterers, and many times as many teen-age bedwetters. While the outside world was decreasing its differential treatment of chil-"},{"pageNumber":1275,"pageContent":"ll6o  TRAGEDY AND HOPE dren on a sexual basis by treating boys and girls more and more alike (and that treatment was better adapted to girls than to boys) within the middle-class home, the growing emotional frustrations of the mother were leading to an increasing distinction on a sexual basis in her emotional treatment of her children. The earliest feeling of sensual reassurance and comfort any child ex- periences is against the body of its mother. To a boy baby this is a heterosexual relationship, while to the girl it is a relationship with the same sex. In most cases the little girl avoids any undesirable persistence of this homosexual tendency by shifting her admiration and attention to some available male, usually her father. Thus bv the age of six or eight, a daughter has become \"Daddv's girl,\" awaiting his return from work to communicate the news of the day, getting his slippers and newspaper, and hoping that he will read her a story or share her viewing of a favorite television program before she must go to bed. By the age of twelve, in a normal girl, this interest in male creatures has begun to shift to some boy in her class at school. With a boy baby the transference is later and less gradual. The undesirable aspects of his love for his mother are avoided by the powerful social pressures of the incest taboo, but this merely means that the sexual element in his concern for the opposite sex is suppressed and is undeveloped. Thus there is a natural, we might almost say bio- logical, tendency in our society for the sexual development of the boy to be delayed and for the girl to be free from this retarding influence. In the American middle-class family of today, these influences have been extraordinarily exaggerated. Because the middle-class marriage i s based on social rather than personal attraction, the emotional relation of the wife to her husband is insecure, and the more her husband buries himself in his work, hobbies, or outside interests, the more insecure and unsatisfactory it becomes for his wife. Part of the wife's unused emo- tional energy begins to be expended in her love for her son. At the same time, because of the emotional insecurity in the mother's rela- tionship with her husband, the daughter may come to be regarded as an emotional rival for the husband's affection. This resentment of the daughter is most likely to occur when there is some other cause of dis- turbance in the mother's psychology, especially if this cause is asso- ciated with her relationship to her own father. For example, as female domination becomes, generation by generation, a more distinctive feature of American family life, the daughter's shift of attention to her father be- comes less complete, and, by adolescence, she tends to pity him rather than to admire him and may become relatively ambivalent in her feeling 8 toward both her father and mother, sometimes hating the latter f° r dominating her father and despising his weakness in allowing it. In suc» a case, the whole development of which we speak is accelerated and inten- sified in the next generation, and the daughter's relatively ambivalen"},{"pageNumber":1276,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  I261  feelings toward her parents are repeated in her relatively ambivalent feel- ings toward her husband. This serves to intensify both her emotional smothering and overprotection of her son and her tendency toward emo- tional rejection of her daughter as a potential danger to the relatively precarious emotional relationship between husband and wife. As a consequence of this situation, the frustrated wife has a tendency to clinsj to her son by keeping him dependent and immature as long as possible and to seek to hasten the maturing of her daughter in order to edge her out of the familv circle as soon as possible. The chief con- sequence of this is the increasingly late maturity, the weakness, under- sexualitv, and dependence of American boys and American men of middle-class origins and the increasingly earlv maturing, aggressiveness, oversexuality, and independence of American middle-class girls. The mother's alienation of the daughter (which often reaches an acute con- dition of mutual hatred) may begin in childhood or even at birth (espe- ciallv if the girl baby is beautiful, is not nursed by the mother, and is welcomed with excessive jov bv the husband). It usually becomes acute when the daughter reaches puberty and may become very acute if the mother, about the same time, is approaching her menopause (which she often mistakenly feels will reduce her attraction as a woman to her husband). During this whole period, the mother's rejection of her daughter ap- pears chiefly in her efforts to force her to grow up rapidly, and leads to premature exposure of the daughter to such modern monstrosities as pre- teen \"mixed parties,\" training bras, access to overly \"sophisticated\" movies, books, and conversations, and the practice of leaving daughters un- chaperoned in the house with boy classmates, on the early high school or even junior high school level. Such experiences and the increasingly frequent clashes of temperament between mother and daughter lead a surprisingly large percentage of middle-class girls to move from the home before the age of twenty. And whether she leaves or not, sexual and emotional maturity comes to the American middle-class girl earlier and earlier, not only in comparison with the middle-class boy but even in absolute terms. We are told, for example, that the onset of puberty among American girls (an event which can be dated exactly by the first menstrual period) has been occurring at an earlier age by about nine months for each passing decade. As a result, this milestone is reached by American girls today up to three years earlier than with American girls of the early twentieth century. Over the same period, the American middle-class boy has been mov- ing in the opposite direction, although the physiological element cannot be documented. Indeed, it need not be. .More significant is the changing re- lationship betw een the arrival of sexual awareness and of emotional readi- ness to accept sex. There can be no doubt that the American child today,"},{"pageNumber":1277,"pageContent":"I262  TRAGEDY AND HOPE especially in a middle-class family, becomes aware of sex much earlier than he did a generation or two ago, and long before he is emotionally ready to face the fact of his own sexuality. In the nineteenth century three things came fairly close together in the fifteen to seventeen age bracket: (1) sexual awareness; ( 2 ) emotional readiness for sex; and (3) the ending of education and the opportunity to seek economic independence from parents. Today sexual awareness comes very early for all, perhaps around the age of ten. Emotional readiness to face the fact of one's own sexuality comes earlier and earlier for the girl today, but later and later for the boy, chiefly because the middle-class mother forces independence and recognition of the fact that she is a woman upon her daughter but forces dependence and blindness to the fact that he is a man upon her son. And the date for the ending of education and seeking economic independence from parents gets somewhat later for girls but immensely later for men (a process that becomes increasingly extravagant). One result of this is that the much greater (sometimes indefinitely postponed) delay for a boy of emotional readiness after sexual awareness leaves the boy emotionally desexed for so long that it affects his sexuality and emotional maturity adversely and to an increasingly advanced age. But the opposite is true for a girl, because of the shorter and decreasing lag of her emotional readiness after her sexual awareness. Lolita, who is not as rare as the readers of that novel wanted to imagine, becomes in- creasingly frequent, and cannot be satisfied by boys of her own age; con- sequently she seeks for many reasons, including financial resources and greater emotional maturity, her sex companions among older men. On the other hand, the position of the middle-class boy becomes even more complex and pitiful, since he not only must face the fluctuating chronology of these developments to a greater degree but must free him- self from his emotional dependence on his mother with little help from anyone. If his father tries to help (and he is the only one who is likely to try to do so), and insists that his son become a responsible and inde- pendent human being, the mother fights like a tigress to defend her son s continued immaturity and dependence, accusing the husband of cruelty* of hatred for his son, and of jealousy of his son's feeling for the mother. She does not hesitate to use the weapons that she has. They are many and powerful, including a \"reluctant\" and ambiguous \"revelation\" to the son that his father hates him. Anv effort by the father to argue that true love must seek to help the son advance in maturity and independence, and that insistence that he avoid or postpone these advances might well be re- garded as hatred rather than love, are usually blocked with case. At this stage in the family history, emotional frustrations and confusions ar generally at so high a level that it is fairly easy for mother and son to agree that black is white. \"Momism\" is usually triumphant for a more <* less extended period, while normal adolescent rebellion becomes a whole-"},{"pageNumber":1278,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  1263  sale rejection of the father and only much later a delayed effort at achiev- ing emotional detachment from the mother. The point of all this is that normal adolescent rebellion has become, in America today, a radical and wholesale rejection of parental values, in- cluding middle-class values, because of the protracted emotional warfare which now goes on in the middle-class home with teen-age children. The chief damage in the situation lies in the pervasive destruction of the adolescent middle-class boy and his alienation from the achieving aspects of middle-class culture. The middle-class girl, chiefly because she still tries to please her father, may continue to be a considerable success as an achiever, especially in academic life where her earlier successes make con- tinuance of the process fairly easy. But the middle-class boy who rejects the achieving aspects of middle-class life often does so in academic mat- ters that seem to him to be an alien and feminine world from the begin- ning. His rejection of this world and his unconscious yearning for aca- demic failure arise from a series of emotional influences: (i) a desire to strike back at his father; (2) a desire to free himself from dependence on his mother and thus to escape from the feminine atmosphere of much academic life; and (3) a desire to escape from the endless academic road, going to age twenty-three or later, which modern technical and social complexities require for access to positions leading to high middle-class success. The lengthening of the interval of time between sexual awareness and the ending of education, from about two years in the 1880's to at least ten or twelve years in the io6o's, has set up such tensions and strains in the bourgeois American family that they threaten to destroy the family and arc already in the process of destroying much of the middle-class outlook that was once so distinctive of the American way of life. From this has emerged an almost total breakdown of communication be- tween teen-agers and their parents' generation. Generally the adolescents do not tell their parents their most acute problems; they do not appeal to parents or adults but to each other for help in facing such problems (except where emotionally Starved girls appeal to men teachers); and, when any effort is made to talk across the gap between the generations, Words may pass but communication does not. Behind this protective bar- rier a new teen-age culture has grown up. Its chief characteristic is re- jection of parental values and of middle-class culture. In many ways this new culture is like that of African tribes: its tastes in music and the dance, its emphasis on sex plav, its increasingly scanty clothing, its emphasis on group solidarity, the high value it puts on interpersonal relations (especially talking and social drinking), its almost total rejection of future preference and its constant efforts to free itself from the tyranny of time. Teen-age solidarity and sociality and especially the solidarity of their groups and subgroups are amazingly African in attitudes, as they gather nightly, or at least on weekends, to drink \"cokes,\" talk"},{"pageNumber":1279,"pageContent":"1264  TRAGEDY AND HOPE interminably in the midst of throbbing music, preferably in semidark- ness, with couples drifting off for sex play in the corners as a kind of social diversion, and a complete emancipation from time. Usually they have their own lan^ua^e, with vocabulary and constructions so strange that parents find them almost incomprehensible. This Africanization or American society is gradually spreading with the passing years to higher age levels in our culture and is having profound and damaging effects on the transfer of middle-class values to the rising generation. A myriad of symbolic acts, over the last twenty years, have served to demon- strate the solidarity of teen culture and its rejection of middle-class values. Many of these involve dress and \"dating customs,\" both major issues in the Adolescent-Parental Cold War. In the days of Horatio Alger, the marks of youthful middle-class aspiration were such obvious symbols as well-polished shoes, a necktie and suit coat, a clean-shaved face and well-cut hair, and punctuality- For almost a generation now, teen culture has rejected the necktie and suit coat. Well-polished shoes gave way to dirty saddle shoes, and these in turn to \"loafers\" and thong sandals. Shaving became irregular, espe- cially when schools were not in session; haircuts were postponed end- lessly, with much parental-adolescent bickering. Fewer and fewer young people carried watches, even when they lived, as on a college campus, in fairly scheduled lives. \"Dating,\" as part of adolescent rebellion, became less and less formal- ized. The formal middle-class dance of a generation ago, arranged weeks ahead and with a dance program, became almost obsolete. Every- thing has to be totally \"casual\" or today's youth rejects it. By 1947 a dance program (listing the dances in numbered order with the girl's partner for each written down) was obsolete. \"Going steady,\" which meant dancing only with the boy who invited her, became established, a complete rejection of the middle-class dance whose purpose was to provide the girl with a maximum number of different partners in order to widen her acquaintance with matrimonial possibilities. \"Going steady,\" like much of adolescent culture of the \"jive\" era, was derived from the gangster circles of south Chicago and was first introduced to middle-class knowledge through George Raft movies 01 the iQ3o's. It was satirized in a now forgotten popular song of the 1920 s called \"I Want to Dance with the Guy What Brung Me.\" But by 1947 it was the way of life of much of adolescent America. As a consequence, teen-age couples at high school dances \"sat out\" most of the evening in bored silence or chatted in a desultory fashion with friends of the same sex. The \"jive\" language of the period also had a south-Chicag 0 origin and has been traced back, to a large extent, to a saloon run by a certain local oracle called \"Hep\" early in the twentieth century. Fortunately, \"going steady\" was only a brief, if drastic, challenge to"},{"pageNumber":1280,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  ll6$  parental attitudes, and was soon replaced by tribal gregariousness and tolerant sexual broad-mindedness, which might be called \"clique going,\" since it involved social solidarity (sometimes sexual promiscuity) within a small group, usually of ten or less. This became, to their adults, the \"teen-age gang,\" which still thrives, but never in a very formal way in middle-class circles as it does in lower-class ones. Two casualties of this process are sexual jealousy and sexual privacy, both of which have largely disappeared among many upper-middle-class young people. In some groups sex has become a purely physiological act, somewhat like eating or sleeping. In others, sexual experience is restricted to loved ones, but since these youths love many persons (or even love everyone) this is much less of a restriction than it might seem to a middle-class mind. Generally a sharp distinction is made between \"loving someone\" (which justifies sex) and being \"in love\" with someone (which justifies monogamous behavior). But there is widespread tolerance and endless discussion of all these issues. This discussion, like most of the adolescents' endless talk, never reaches any decisions but leaves the question open or decides that \"it all depends on how you look at it.\" As part of such discussions, there is complete casual frankness as to who has had or is having sexual experi- ences with whom. Widely permeated with an existentialist outlook, the adolescent society regards each sexual experience as an isolated, contextless act, with no necessary cause or consequence, except the momentary merging of two lonelinesses in an act of togetherness. Among middle-class youth it is accompanied by an atmosphere of compassion or pity rather than of passion or even love (the way Holden Caulfield might experience sex). Among lower-class persons it is much more likely to be physiolog- ically inspired and associated with passion or roughness. This often attracts middle-class girls who become dissatisfied with the weakness and undersexualitv of middle-class boys. But petty-bourgeois youth, as befits the final defenders of middle-class conventionality and hypocrisy, still tend to approach sex with secrecy and even guilt. Because of the breakdown of communication between the generations of middle-class families, parents know little of this side of teen-age culture, at least so far as their own children are concerned. They usually know much more about the behavior of their friends' children, because they are more likelv to catch glimpses of the behavior of the latter in Unguarded moments. On the whole, middle-class parents today are surprisingly (and secretly) tolerant about the behavior of their daught- ers so long as they do not create a public scandal by \"getting into trouble.\" Mothers usually feel that their sons are too young and should tyait for sexual experience, while fathers sometimes secretly think it might do their son's immaturity some good. When middle-class children get into trouble, or any kind of a scrape, their only large anxiety is to"},{"pageNumber":1281,"pageContent":"1266  TRAGEDY AND HOPE prevent their parents from finding out. Pettv-bourgeois parents, as the last defense of middle-class conventionality, generally disapprove of any illicit sexual experiences by any of their children. Naturally there are great variations in all these things, with religion as the chief varying factor and variety of local customs in secondary significance. However, even in religious circles, the behavior of the voting is not at all what their adults expect or believe. For example, the number of Roman Catholic young people who have premarital, or even casual, sexual experiences is much larger than the number who are willing to eat meat on Fridav. One reason for the spreading of these relaxed ideas on behavior is the devastating honesty of the younger generation, especially about themselves. This seems to be based on their gregarious garrulity. An earlier generation had its share of illicit actions of various kinds, but they kept these a secret and regarded each as an aberrant action that was psychologically excluded from their accepted social patterns and would not, therefore, be repeated. This view continued, no matter how often it was repeated. But the younger generation of today has accepted the existentialist idea, \"I am what I do.\" The adolescent tells his group what he did, and they usually agree that this is the way he is, however surprising it is. Their whole attitude is pragmatic, almost experimental: \"This is what happened. This is the way things are. This is the way I am.\" They are engaged in a search for themselves as individuals, some- thing they were called upon to do in the early grades of school, thanks to the misconceptions of John Dewey, and thev are quite alien to any theory that the self is a creature of trained patterns and is not a creatui' c of discovered secrets. Now, in the 1960's, this opinion of man's nature is changing and, as a consequence of George Orwell, mishmash concep- tions of brainwashing, and the revival of Pavlovian psychology through the work of men like Professor B.

In general this negative attitude appears in many of the activities we have described and above all in a profound rejection of abstractions, slogans, cliches, and conventions. These are treated with tolerant irony tinged with contempt. The targets of these attitudes are the general values of the petty bourgeoisie and of middle-class parents: position in society, \"what people think,\" \"self-respect,\" \"keeping up with the Joneses,\" \"the American Way of Life,\" \"virtue,\" \"making money,\" \"destroying our country's enemies,\" virginity, respect for established organizations (including their elders, the clergy, political leaders, or big businessmen), and such. The shift from a destructive or negative to a positive view of the new American outlook is, to some extent, chronological; it may be seen in the former popularity of Elvis Presley and the newer enthusiasm for Joan Baez (or folk singers generally). There is also a social distinction here to some extent, as Elvis remains, to a fair degree, popular with the lower classes, while Joan is a middle-class (or even college-level) favorite. But the contrast in outlook between the two is what is significant. Joan is gentle, compassionate, unemphatic, totally honest, concerned about people as individuals, free of pretenses (singing quietly in a simple dress and bare feet), full of love and fundamental human decency, and committed to these. The rejection of acquisitiveness and even of sensualitv may be seen in the change in tastes in movies, especially in the popularity of foreign films directed by men like Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini. The latter's La Dolce Vita (1961), a smash hit in the United States, was a portrayal of the meaningless disillusionment of material success and of sensuality in contrast with the power and mystery of nature (symbolized by a giant fish pulled from the sea and left to die by thoughtless men and the direct honesty and innocence of a child watching the scene). This rejection of material things and of sensuality is, in some strange way, leading the younger generation to some kind of increased spirit- uality. Property and food mean very little to them. They share almost everything, give to others when they have very little for themselves, expect reciprocal sharing but not repayment, and feel free to \"borrow\" in this way without permission. Three meals a day is out; in fact, meals are almost out. They eat very little and irregularly, in sharp contrast to the middle classes early in the century who overate, as many mature middle-class persons still do. The petty bourgeoisie and lower classes still tend to overeat or to be neurotic snackers, but middle-class youth is almost monastic in its eating. Food just is not important, unless it is an occasion for a crowd to gather. Much of this decrease in emphasis on food is a consequence of their rejection of the discipline of time."},{"pageNumber":1283,"pageContent":"1268  TRAGEDY AND HOPE Everything in their lives is irregular (including their natural bodily processes). They usually get up too late to eat hreakfast, snack some- where along the day, refuse to carry watches, and often have no idea what day of the week it is. This new outlook is basically existentialist in its emphasis on direct, momentary personal experience, especially with other people. It em- phasizes people, and finds the highest good of life in interpersonal rela- tions, handled generally with compassion and irony. The two chief concerns of life are \"caring\" and \"helping.\" \"Caring,\" which they usually call \"love,\" means a general acceptance of the fact that people matter and are subjects of concern. This love is diffuse and often quite imper- sonal, not aimed at a particular individual or friend but at anyone, at persons in general, and especially at persons one does not know at all. as an act of recognition, almost of expiation, that we are all helpless children together. The whole idea is very close to Christ's message, \"Love one another,\" and has given rise to the younger generations passionate concern with remote peoples, the American Negroes, and the outcast poor. It is reflected in the tremendous enthusiasm among the young for the Peace Corps, civil rights, and racial equality, and the attack on poverty, all of which have much greater support among middle-class young people than can be measured even by the surprisingly large numbers who actively do something. This desire to do something is what I call \"helping.\" It is a strange and largely symbolic kind of helping, since there is wi th it a fairly widespread feeling that nothing that the helper can do will make any notable dent in the colossal problem; none the less, there is an obligation to do something, not only as a symbolic act but also as an almost masochistic rejection of the middle-class past. The younger generation who support the Peace Corps, the attack on poverty, and the drive for Negro rights have an almost irresistible compulsion to do these things as a demonstration of their rejection of their parents' value system, and as some restitution for the adults' neglect of these urgent problems- But the real motivation behind the urge \"to help\" is closely related with the urge \"to care\"; it consists simply of a desire to show another human being that he is not alone. There is little concern for human perfectibility or social progress such as accompanied middle-class hu- manitarianism in the nineteenth century. Both of these urges are existentialist. They give rise to isolated acts that have no significant context. Thus an act of loving or helping has no sequence of causes leading up to it or of consequences flowing frofli it. It stands alone as an isolated experience of togetherness and of brie human sharing. This failure or lack of context for each experience means a failure or lack of meaning, for meaning and significance arise from context; that is, from the relationship of the particular experience"},{"pageNumber":1284,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  1269  to the whole picture. But today's youth has no concern for the whole picture; they have rejected the past and have very little faith in the future. Their rejection of intellect and their lack of faith in human reason gives them no hope that any meaning can be found for any experience, so each experience becomes an end in itself, isolated from every other experience. This skepticism about meaning, closely allied with their rejection of organizations and of abstractions, is also closely related with a failure of responsibility. Since consequences are divorced from the act or experi- ence itself, the youth is not bound by any relationship between the two. The result is a large-scale irresponsibility. If a young person makes an appointment, he may or may not keep it. He may come very late or not at all. In any case, he feels no shame at failure to carry out what he had said he would do. In fact, the young people of today constantly speak of what they are going to do—after lunch, tonight, tomorrow, next week—but they rarely do what they say. To them it was always very tentative, a hope rather than a statement, and binding on no one. If the young fail to do what they say, they are neither embarrassed nor apologetic, and hardly think it necessary to explain or even mention it. Their basic position is that everyone concerned had the same freedom to come or not, and if you showed up while they did not, this does not give you any right to complain because you also had the same right to stay away as they had. The other great weakness of the younger generation is their lack of self-discipline. They are as episodic in their interests and ambitions as they are in their actions. They can almost kill themselves with overwork for something that catches their fancy, usually something associated with their group or with \"caring\" and \"helping,\" but in general they have little tenacity of application or self-discipline in action. They lack imagination also, an almost inevitable consequence of an outlook that concentrates on experiences without context. Their experi- ences are necessarily limited and personal and are never fitted into a larger picture or linked with the past or the future. As a result they find it almost impossible to picture anything different from what it is, or even to see what it is from any long-range perspective. This means that their outlooks, in spite of their wide exposure to different situations through the mass media or by personal travel, are very narrow. Thev lack the desire to obtain experience vicariously from reading, and the vicarious experiences that they get from talk (usually with their fellows) are rarely much different from their own experiences. As a result, their lives, while erratic, are strangely dull and homogeneous. Even their sexual experiences are routine, and any efforts to escape this by experi- menting with homosexuality, alcohol, drugs, extraracial partners, or other unnecessary fringe accessories generally leave it dull and routine."},{"pageNumber":1285,"pageContent":"I27O  TRAGEDY AND HOPE Efforts by middle-class parents to prevent their children from de- veloping along these non-middle-class lines are generally futile. An effort to use parental discipline to enforce conformity to middle-class values or behavior means that the child will quote all the many cases in the neighborhood where the children are not being disciplined. He is encouraged in his resistance to parental discipline by its large-scale failure all around him. .Moreover, if his parents insist on conformity, he has an invincible weapon to use against them.- academic failure. This weapon is used by boys rather than by girls, partly because it is a weapon for the weak, and involves doing nothing rather than doing something, but also because the school seems to most middle-class boys an alien place and an essential element in their general adolescent feeling of homelessness. Girls who are pressured by their parents to conform resist by sexual delinquencies more often than boys, and in extreme cases get pregnant or have sexual experiences with Negro boys. From this whole context of adolescent resistance to parental pressures to conform to middle-class behavior flows a major portion of middle-class adolescent delinquency, which is quite distinct in its origin from the delinquency of the lowest, outcast class in the slums. It involves all kinds of activities from earliest efforts to smoke or drink, through speeding, car stealing, and vandalism of property, to major crimes and perversions. It is quite different in origin and usually in character from the delinquencies of the uprooted, which are either crimes for personal benefits (such as thievery and mugging) or crimes of social resentment (such as slashing tires and convertible tops or smashing school windows). Some activities, of course, such as automobile stealing, appear among both. These remarks, it must be emphasized, apply to the middle class, and are not intended to apply to the other classes in American society. The aristocrats, for example, have considerable success in passing along their outlook to their children, partly because it is presented as a class or family attitude, and not as a parental or personal attitude, partly because their friends and close associates are also aristocrats or semi- aristocrats, and rejection of their point of view tends to leave an aris- tocratic adolescent much more personally isolated than rejection of his parents' view leaves a middle-class adolescent (indeed, the latter finds group togetherness onlv if he does reject his parents), partly because there is much more segregation of the sexes among aristocrats than in the middle class, but chiefly because the aristocrats use a separate school system, including disciplined boarding schools. The use of the latter, the key to the long persistence of the aristocratic tradition in England, makes it possible for outsiders to discipline adolescents without dis- rupting the family. Among the middle class, effort to discipline adoles- cents is largely in the hands of parents, but the effort to do so tends to disrupt the family by setting husband against wife and children"},{"pageNumber":1286,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  I27I  against parents. As a result, discipline is usually held back to retain at least the semblance of family solidarity as viewed from the outside world (which is what really counts with middle-class people). But the aristo- cratic private boarding school, modeled on those of England in accord with the basic Anglophilism of the American aristocracv, is sexually segregated from females, tough, sports-orientated, usually High Epis- copal (almost Anglican), and disciplines its charges with the importance of the group, their dutv to the group, and the painfulness of the ultimate punishment, which is alienation from the group. As a consequence of this, any resentment the aristocratic adolescent may have is aimed at his masters, not at his home and parents, and home comes to represent a relatively desirable place to which he is admitted occasionally as a reward for long weeks on the firing line at school. Such a boy is re- moved from the smothering influence of \"momism,\" grows up relativelv shy of girls, has more than his share of homosexual experiences (to which he may succumb completely), but, on the whole, usually grows up to be a very energetic, constructive, stable, and self-sacrificing citizen, prepared to inflict the same training process on his own sons. Unfortunately for the aristocrat who wishes to expose his son to the same training process as that which molded his own outlook, he finds this a difficult thing to do because the organizations that helped form him outside the familv, the Episcopal Church (or its local equivalent), the boarding school, the Ivy League university, and the once-sheltered summer resort have all changed and are being invaded by a large number of nonaristocratic intruders who change the atmosphere of the whole place. This change in atmosphere is hard to define to anyone who has not experienced it personally. Fundamentally it is a distinction between playing the game and playing to win. The aristocrat plays for the sake of the game or the team or the school. He plays whether he is much good or not, because he feels that he is contributing to a community effort even if he is on the scrubs rather than a star or starting player. The newer recruits to former aristocratic educational institutions play for more personal reasons, with much greater intensity, even fanaticism, and play to excel and to distinguish themselves from others. One reason for the accessibility of formerly aristocratic organizations to people of nonaristocratic origin has already been noted, but probably was discounted by the reader. That is my statement that the American Establishment, which is so aristocratic and Anglophile in its foundation, came to accept the liberal ideology. The Episcopal Church, exclusive boarding schools, and Ivy League universities (like Eton and Oxford) decided that they must open their door to the \"more able\" of the non- aristocratic classes. Accordingly, they established scholarships, recruited for these in lower schools they had never thought of before, and made"},{"pageNumber":1287,"pageContent":"1272  TRAGEDY AND HOPE efforts to have their admission requirements and examinations fit the past experiences of nonaristocratic applicants. By the end of the 1920's, Philips Exeter Academy was welcoming on scholarships the sons of labor- ing immigrants with polysyllabic names, and by the 1950's Episcopal clergymen were making calls on \"likely-looking\" Negro families. As a consequence of this, the sons of aristocrats found themselves being squeezed out of the formative institutions that had previously trained their fathers and, at the same time, discovered that these institu- tions were themselves changing their character and becoming dominated by petty-bourgeois rather than by aristocratic values. At the alumni reunions of June 1964, the President of Harvard was asked in an open forum what the questioner should do with his son, recently rejected for admission to Harvard in spite of the fact that the son was descended from the Mayfloxver voyagers by eleven consecutive generations of Harvard men. To this tragic question President Pusey replied: \"I don't know what we can do about your son. We can't send him back, because the Mayftoixer isn't running any more.\" Despite this facetious retort, which may have been called forth by the inebriate condition of the questioner, the fact remains that the aristocratic outlook has a great deal to contribute to any organization fortunate enough to share it. Among other things, it has kept Harvard (where aristocratic control continued almost to the present day) at the top or close to the top of the American educational hierarchy decade after decade. The sincere effort, by aristocrats and democrats alike, to make the social ladder in America a ladder of opportunity rather than a ladder of privilege has opened the way to a surge of petty-bourgeois recruits over the faltering bodies of the disintegrating middle class. The petty bourgeois are rising in American society along the channels established in the great American hierarchies of business, the armed forces, academic life, the professions, finance, and politics. They are doing this not because they have imagination, broad vision, judgment, moderation, versatility, or group loyalties but because they have neurotic drives of personal ambition and competitiveness, great insecurities and resentments, narrow specialization, and fanatical application to the task before each of them. Their fathers, earning $100 a week as bank clerks or insurance agents while unionized bricklayers were getting $120 a week when they cared to work, embraced the middle-class ideology with tenacity as the chief means (along with their \"white collared\" clothing) of distinguishing themselves from the unionized labor they fet.red or hated. Their wives, whom they had married because they held the same outlook, looked forward eagerly to seeing their sons become the kind of material success the father had failed to reach. The family accepted a common outlook that believed specialization and hard work, either in business or in a profession, would win this material success-"},{"pageNumber":1288,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  1273  The steps up that ladder of success were clearly marked—to be the outstanding boy student and graduate in school, to win entrance to and graduation from \"the best\" university possible (naturally an Ivy League one), and then the final years of specialized application in a professional school. Many of these eager workers headed for medicine, because to them medicine, despite the ten years of necessary preparation, meant up to $40,000 a year income by age fifty. As a consequence, the medical profession in the United States ceased, very largely, to be a profession of fatherly confessors and unprofessing humanitarians and became one of the largest groups of hardheaded petty-bourgeois hustlers in the United States, and their professional association became the most ruth- lessly materialistic lobbying association of any professional group. Similar persons with lesser opportunities were shunted off the more advantage- ous rungs of the ladder into second-best schools and third-rate univer- sities. All flocked into the professions, even to teaching (which, on the face of it, might have expected that its practitioners would have some allegiance to the truth and to helping the young to realize their less materialistic potentialities), where they quickly abandoned the class- room for the more remunerative tasks of educational administration. And, of course, the great mass of these eager beavers went into science or business, preferably into the largest corporations, where they looked with fishy-eved anticipation at those rich, if remote, plums of vice-pres- idencies, in General Motors, Ford, General Dynamics, or International Business Machines. The success of these petty-bourgeois recruits in America's organ- izational structure rested on their ability to adapt their lives to the screening processes tiie middle classes had set up covering access to the middle-class organizational structures. The petty bourgeoisie, as the last fanatical defenders of the middle-class outlook, had, in excess degree, the qualities of self-discipline and future preference the middle classes had established as the unstated assumptions behind their screens of apti- tude testing, intelligence evaluation, motivational research, and poten- tial-success measurements. Above all, the American public school system, permeated with the unstated assumptions of middle-class values, was ideally suited to demonstrate petty-bourgeois \"success quotients.\" These successive barriers in the middle-class screening process were almost insurmountable to the working class and the outcast, became very difficult to the new generation of middle-class children, who rejected their par- ents' value system, but were ideally adapted to the petty-bourgeois anxiety neuroses.

In his farewell report the Chairman of Harvard's Admissions Committee, Wilbur Bender, summed up the problem this wav: \"The student who ranks first in his class may be genuinely brilliant or he may be a compulsive worker or the instrument of domineering parents' ambitions or a conformist or a self-centered careerist who has shrewdly calculated his teachers' prejudices and expectations and dis- covered how to regurgitate efficiently what thev want. Or he mav have focused narrowly on grade-getting as compensation for his inadequacies in other areas, because he lacks other interests or talents or lacks passion and warmth or normal healthy instincts or is afraid of life. The top high school student is often, frankly, a pretty dull and bloodless, or peculiar fellow. The adolescent with wide-ranging curiosity and stubborn inde- pendence, with a vivid imagination and desire to explore fascinating bypaths, to follow his own interests, to contemplate, to read the unre- quired books, the bov filled with sheer love of life and exuberance, may well seem to his teachers troublesome, undisciplined, a rebel, may not conform to their stereotype, and may not get the top grades and the highest rank in class. He may not even score at the highest level in the standard multiple choice admissions tests, which may well reward the glib, facile mind at the expense of the questioning, independent, or slower but more powerful, more subtle, and more interesting and original mind.\" These remarks bring us close to one of the major problems in Amer- ican culture today. We need a culture that will produce people eager to do things, but we need even more a culture that will make it possible to decide what to do. This is the old division of means and goals. Deci- sions about goals require values, meaning, context, perspective. They can be set, even tentatively and approximately, only by people who have some inkling of the whole picture. The middle-class culture of our past ignored the whole picture and destroyed our ability to see it by its emphasis on specialization. Just as mass production came to be based on specialization, so human preparation for making decisions about goals also became based on specialization. The free elective system in higher education was associated with choice of a major field of specialization, and all the talk about liberal arts, outside electives, general education, or required distribution were largely futile. They were futile because no general view of the whole picture could be made simply by attaching together a number of specialist views of narrow fields, for the simple reason that each specialist field looks entirely different, presenting dif- ferent problems and requiring different techniques, when it is placed"},{"pageNumber":1290,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  1275  in the general picture. This simple fact still has not been realized in those circles that talk most about broadening outlooks. This was clearly- shown in the influential Harvard Report on General Education (1945). As one reviewer of this document said, \"It cost $40,000 to produce and a better answer could have been found bv buving one of the books of Sir Richard Livingstone for $2.75.\" This remark is equally mistaken on the opposite side, a fact that shows that the solution can be found only by all parties freeing themselves from their preconceptions by getting as familiar as possible with the diverse special areas in a skeptical way. .Means are almost as difficult as ends. In fact, personal responsibility, self-discipline, some sense of time value and future preference, and, above all, an ability to distinguish what is important from what is merely neces- sary must be found, simply as valuable attributes of human beings as human beings. Neither America nor the world can be saved by a whole- sale re-creation of African social realities here in consequence of our rejection of the middle-class outlook that brought us this far. Here we must discriminate. We have an achieving society because we have an achieving outlook in our society. And that achieving outlook has been, over the last few centuries, the middle-class outlook. But there are other achieving outlooks. An achieving society could be constructed on the aristocratic outlook, on the scientific outlook (pursuit of truth), on a religious basis, and probably on a large number of other outlooks. There is no need to go back to the middle-class outlook, which really killed itself by successfully achieving what it set out to do. But parts of it we need, and above all we need an achieving outlook. It might be pleasant just to give up, live in the present, enjoying existential personal experi- ences, living like lotus-eaters from our amazing productive system, with- out personal responsibility, self-discipline, or thought of the future. But this is impossible, because the productive system would itself collapse, and our external enemies would soon destroy us. \\Vc must have an achieving society and an achieving outlook. These will inevitably contain parts of the middle-class outlook, but these parts will unquestionably be fitted together to serve quite different purposes, future preference and self-discipline were originally necessary in our Society so that people would restrict consumption and accumulate savings that could be spent to provide investment in capital equipment. Now we no longer need these qualities for this purpose, since flows of income in our economy provide these on an institutional basis, but we still need these qualities so that young people will be willing to undergo the years of hard work and training that will prepare them to work in our complex technological society.

Above all, we must bring meaning back into human experience. This, like establishing an achieving outlook, can be done by going backward in our Western tradition to the period before we had any bourgeois outlook. For our society had both meaning and purpose long before it had any middle class. Indeed, these are intrinsic elements in our society. In fact, the middle-class outlook obtained its meaning and purpose from the society where it grew up; it did not give meaning and purpose to the society. And capitalism, along with the middle-class outlook, became meaningless and purposeless when it so absorbed men's time and energies that men lost touch with the meaning and purpose of the society in which capitalism was a brief and partial aspect. But as a consequence of the influence of capitalism and of the middle classes, the tradition was broken, and the link between the meaning and purpose of our society as it was before the middle-class revolution is no longer connected with the search for meaning and purpose by the new post-middle-class gen- eration. This can be seen even in those groups like the Christian clergy who insisted that they were still clinging to the basic Christian tradition of our society. They were doing no such thing, but instead were usually offering us meaningless verbiage or unrealistic abstractions that had little to do with our desire to experience and live in a Christian way here and now. Unfortunately, very few people, even highly regarded experts on the subject, have any very clear idea of what is the tradition of the West or how it is based on the fundamental need of Western Civilization to reconcile its intellectual outlook with the basic facts of the Christian experience. The reality of the world, time, and the flesh forced, bit by bit, abandonment of the Greek rationalistic dualism (as in Plato) that opposed spirit and matter and made knowledge exclusively a concern of the former, achieved by internal illumination. This point of view that gave final absolute knowledge (and thus justified despotism) was replaced in the period 1100-1350 by the medieval point of view that derived knowledge from the tentative and partial information obtained through sensual experience from which man derived conceptual univer- sal that fitted the real individual cases encountered in human experience only approximately. Aquinas, who said, \"Nothing exists in the intelli- gence which was not first present in the senses,\" also said, \"We cannot shift from the ideal to the actual.\" On this epistemological basis was established the root foundations of both modern science and modern liberalism, with a very considerable boost to both from the Franciscan nominalists of the century following Aquinas. The Classical world had constantly fallen into intellectual error be- cause it never solved the epistemological problem of the relationship between the theories and concepts in men's minds and the individual"},{"pageNumber":1292,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  1277  objects of sensual experience. The medieval period made a detailed examination of this problem, but its answer was ignored when post- Renaissance thinkers broke the tradition in philosophy because they felt it necessary to break the tradition in religion. From Descartes onward, this epistemological problem was ignored or considered in a childish way, as if the medieval thinkers had never examined it. Today it remains as the great philosophic problem of our age. Irrational Activism, seman- ticism, and existentialism flourish because the present century has no answer to the epistemological problem. In fact, most contemporary thinkers do not even recognize that there is a problem. But Bergson's rejection of intelligence and his advocacy of intuition was based, like the Irrational Activism whence it sprang, on recognition of the fact that the space-time continuum in which man generally operates is nonra- tional. The whole existential movement was based on the same idea. Semanticism tried to solve the problem, in a similiar fashion, bv bring- ing the infinitely varied and dynamic quality of actuality into the human mind by insisting that the meaning of each word must follow the dyna- mics of the world by changing every time it is used. All these move- ments tried to reject logic and rationality from the human thinking process because they are not found in space-time actuality. But the tradition of the West, as clearly established in the Christian religion and in medieval philosophy, was that man must use rationality to the degree it is possible in handling a universe whose ultimate nature is well beyond man's present rational capability to grasp. This is the conclusion that the success of the West in World War II forces the West and the world to recognize once again. And in recognizing it, we must return to the tradition, so carelessly discarded in the fifteen century, which had shown the relationship between thought and action. Alfred Korzybski argued (in Science and Sanity) that mental health depended on successful action and that successful action depended on an adequate relationship between the irrational nature of the objective world and the vision of the world that the actor has subjectively in his head. Korzybski's solution, like most other thinkers over the last two generations, has been to bring the irrationality of the world into man's thinking processes. This solution of the problem is now bankrupt, totally destroyed at Hiroshima and Berlin in 1945. The alternative solution lies in the tradition of the West. It must be found, and the link with our past must be restored so that the tradition may resume the process of growth that was interrupted so long ago. Korzybski, Bergson, and the rest of them are quite correct—most of man's experience takes place in an irrational actuality of space-time. But we now know that man must deal with his experience through subjective processes that are both rational and logical (using rules of thought explicitly understood by all concerned); and the necessary ad- justments between the conclusions reached by thought and the confused"},{"pageNumber":1293,"pageContent":"I27S  TRAGEDY AND HOPE irrationalities of experience must be made in the process of shifting from thought to action, and not in the thinking process itself. Only thus will the West achieve successful thought, successful action, and the sanity that is the link between these two. As a result of this rupture of tradition, the thinkers of today are fumbling in an effort to find a meaning that will satisfy them. This is as true of the contemporary babbling philosophers as it is of the younger generation who fumblingly try to express Christ's message of love and help without any apparent realization that Christ's message is available in writing and that generations of thinkers debated its implications cen- turies ago. The meaning the present generation is seeking can be found in our own past. Part of it, concerned with loving and helping, can be found in Christ by going back to the age before his message was over- whelmed in ritualism and bureaucracy. Part of it can be found in the basic philosophic outlook of the West as seen in medieval philosophy and the scientific method that grew out of it. The problem of meaning today is the problem of how the diverse and superficially self-contradictory experiences of men can be put into a consistent picture that will provide contemporary man with a convincing basis from which to live and to act. This can be achieved only by a hierarchy that distinguishes what is necessary from what is important, as the medieval outlook did. But any modern explanation based on hierarchy must accept dynamicism as an all-pervasive element in the system, as the medieval hierarchv so signally failed to do. The effort of Teilhard de Chardin to do this has won enormous interest in recent years, but its impact has been much blunted by the fact that his presen- tation contained, in reciprocal relationship, a deficiency of courage and a surplus of deliberate ambiguity. However, the real problem does not rest so much in theory as in prac- tice. The real value of anv society rests in its ability to develop mature and responsible individuals prepared to stand on their own feet, make decisions, and be prepared to accept the consequences of their decisions and actions without whining or self-justification. This was the ideal that the Christian tradition established long ago, and in consequence of its existence, our Western society*, whatever its deficiencies, has done bet- ter than anv other society that has ever existed. If it has done less well recently than earlier in its career (a disputable point of view), this weak- ness can be remedied onlv by some reform in its methods of childrearing that will increase its supply of mature and responsible adults. Once this process had been established, the adults thus produced can be relied upon to adopt from our Western heritage of the past a modified ideology that will fit the needs of the present as well as the traditions of the past.

The general picture we might draw is of a continent deprived, for at least one full generation (1914-1950), of political, economic, social, and psychological security; in consequence, that area came to regard these things as major aims in its personal behavior patterns. So many European families were deprived of even the necessary materials of living that they are today, to varying degrees, obsessed with the desire for these, now that it seems possible to get them. For this reason, the chief impres- sion the visiting American brings back from Europe is one of grasping materialism and exaggerated individualism. This is a spirit akin to America of the 1920's rather than of the 1950's. It is found, with a variety of em- phasis, among the peasants, the workers, and even the aristocracy, as well as among the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeosie, where we expect it. It is combined with an antagonism between classes and groups that is rare in America (except among the petty bourgeoisie). The middle-class adoles- cent revolt is rarer and much harsher in Europe, shot through with ele- ments of hatred, where in America it is shot through with elements of indiscriminate loving. And in Europe the selfishness and general bitchi- ness of middle-class girls is much greater than in the United States, prob- ably because the stronger male-dominant tradition of Europe leaves them less freedom, less self-esteem, and lower personal evaluation. As an example of the diversity of Europe, we should say that this last remark is more true of southern Europe than of northern Europe, and largely untrue of England. In fact, most generalizations about Europe do not apply to England at all. In the European search for security the two dominant aims have been"},{"pageNumber":1295,"pageContent":"ll8o  TRAGEDY AND HOPE security against a Soviet attack and nuclear war and security against eco- nomic collapse such as occurred in the 1930's and opened the way to Nazism and World War II. The disorganization of Europe in the imme- diate postwar period allowed the United States to play a dominant role in both of these aims. However, by the later 1950's, as fear of war and de- pression subsided, it became possible for Europe to adopt a more inde- pendent attitude. At the same time, the personal influence of President de Gaulle gave this new independence anti-American overtones, which, however justified bv the general's personal experiences with incompetent American foreign policies, none the less were injurious to the solidarity and prosperity of Europe. As long as American influence was dominant, the security of Europe was based primarily on America's strategic nuclear power, supplemented in an ambiguous way by the fifteen-nation NATO Treaty, which in- cluded both the United States and Canada. On the economic side, Euro- pean prosperity was based, for many years, on American economic aid. Both of these influences were exercised to develop, as an ultimate goal, an integrated western Europe that would include Britain and be closely allied to North America. As we have already seen, these efforts gradually bogged down in a complicated morass of partly integrated systems on a functional, rather than a federative, basis and bv 1965 were stalemated over a number of unresolved inconsistencies of approach. These problems will be analyzed in a moment, but before we do so we should point out that a new Europe is clearly being formed on lines that have little in common with the Europe of prewar days. That earlier Europe was based on the social and ideological patterns of the past, and continued to reflect them, even when the real forces of military and economic technology were cre- ating quite different relationships. Moreover, these older patterns were quite rigid and doctrinaire. In most of Europe they showed sharp, almost irreconcilable, divisions into three political groupings that we might designate as conservative, liberal, and Socialist. These represented, in order, the social forces of the eighteenth century, of the mid-nineteenth century, and of the early twentieth century. The conservatives stood for an alliance of all the forces of the period before the French Revolution of 1789: the agrarian and landed interests, the old nobility and monarchy, the clerical interests, and the old army. The liberals stood for the bourgeois interests of the commercial, financial, and industrial revolutions; they were con- cerned with maintaining the dominant position of property, were usuallv rigid supporters of laissez faire, were opposed to influence based on birth or land, were opposed to extension of state authority, and were usua llv anticlerical and antimilitarist. The Socialists represented the interests and ideas of the working masses of the cities. They were in favor of dcmoc- racy and individual political equality, and wanted the activities of the"},{"pageNumber":1296,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  1281  state to be extended to regulate economic life for the benefit of the or- dinary man. The Socialists were generally opposed to the same social groups and older interests as the liberals, but added to these enemies the bourgeoisie also. In general, these three diverse groupings were rigid, and put more emphasis on the things that divided them than on matters of common concern. Their hatreds were more dominant than their common interests. These divisions of Europe along lines of selfish interests, old slogans, doctrinaire hatreds, and misconceived rivalries made possible the rise of Fascism and the disasters of World War II. Out of these disasters, in the turmoil and violence of the Resistance, there began to appear the linea- ments of a new Europe. This new Europe was much more pragmatic, and thus less doctrinaire; it was much more cooperative and less com- petitive; it was much more receptive to diversity, partial solutions, and the need for mutual dependence than the period before 1939 had been. On the whole this new spirit, found among the leaders rather than among the masses, was much closer to what we have defined as the tradition of the West than the Europe of 1900 had been. It must be recognized that this new Europe had its roots in the Re- sistance, and, as such, had traces of those elements of self-sacrifice, human solidarity, personal integrity, and flexible improvisation that appeared so unexpectedly among the hardened Resistance fighters. We might say that many of the elements of outlook and leadership of the new postwar Europe emerged from underground, and were unnoticed by those who had not been in active contact with the underground. Thus they were not observed by the leaders in Washington and in London, even by De Gaulle, and, above all, were unreported by Allen Dulles, who was sup- posed to be observing the underground for the OSS from Switzerland. Supporters of this new outlook were determined to break free from the nationalistic hatreds of the prewar period and to emphasize instead Europe as a cultural entity of diverse nationalities. Above all, they were insistent on the urgent need to heal the terrible breach, running through the heart of Europe, between France and Germany. Thev were eager to establish some kind of liaison between religion and Socialism, by way of Christian charity and social welfare, in order to repudiate the unnatural nineteenth-century alliance between the clergy and capitalism. They were determined to use the power of the state to settle the common problems of man, unhampered by doctrinaire liberalism and laissez faire. And thev recognized the joint role of capital and labor in any productive process, although they had no way of measuring or of dividing the rewards of each from that process. In two words this new outlook was determined to make Europe more \"unified\" and more \"spiritual.\" This new outlook was unable to influence the fate of Europe for at least a decade after the ending of World War II in 1945 because of the ur-"},{"pageNumber":1297,"pageContent":"1282  TRAGEDY AND HOPE gent material need to repair the devastation of the war, the overwhelming threat to Europe from the Soviet Union and from doctrinaire Com- munism, and because of the dependence of Europe, both for reconstruc- tion and defense, on the United States and Britain, both of whom ignored the new forces stirring on the Continent. By 1955, however, as these urgent problems receded into the background and Europe became in- creasingly able to stand on its own feet, the new structure began to be- come visible, indicated by the cooperation of Christian Socialists and Social Democrats in the constructive process and by the continued de- cline of the forces of the extreme Right and the extreme Left. It was the new spirit, rooted in the Resistance and the tacit agreement of the Christian Socialist and Social Democratic political groups, that made it possible to work toward European unity and to use this unity as the foundation for a rich and independent Europe. The task is still only partly done; it may, indeed, never be completed, for nothing is more per- sistent than the old established institutions and outlooks that stand as bar- riers along the way. The central problem of Europe remains today, as it has for a century, the problem of Germany. And today, as before, this problem cannot be solved without Britain. But such a solution requires that Britain accept the fact that it is, since the invention of the airplane and the rocket, a European, and not a world, or even an Atlantic, Power. This the leaders of Britain and the American branch of the British Establishment have been unwilling to accept. As a consequence, Britain remains aloof from the Continent, committed to the \"Atlantic Community\" and to the Com- monwealth of Xations, and, accordingly, the political unification of West- ern Europe stands suspended, part way to fulfillment, while the German problem, still capable of triggering the destruction of Western society, remains unsolved. Briefly the problem is this: no one concerned—the Soviet Union, the United States, or Europe itself—can permit Germany to be unified again in the foreseeable future. A united Germany would be a force of instability and danger to everyone, including the Germans, because it would be the most powerful nation in Europe and, balanced between East and West, might at any time fall into collaboration with one of these to the intense danger of the other; or, if the Russian-American antithesis remained irreparable, a united Germany could put extreme pressures on its lesser neighbors between the two Superpowers. The peace and stability of Europe thus require the permanent division of Germany, something on which the Soviet Union is adamant to the point of resorting to force to retain it, although the official policy of the United States is still com- mitted to a reunification of Germanv, partly in the belief that the loyalty of West Germany to the Atlantic Alliance can be retained only if the United States remains explicitly committed to a future reacquisition 01"},{"pageNumber":1298,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IX PERSPECTIVE  1283  East Germany by West Germany. In fact, the eagerness of the latter to acquire the former is dwindling, although very slowly, since the east is now so poor that it could bring little but poverty to West Germany's booming prosperity. This separation of the Germanys can be made permanent onlv if each is incorporated, as fullv as possible, into a larger, and distinct, political system. But the smaller countries of Europe, particularlv the Netherlands and Belgium, do not wish to be united with Germany in anv federated system that includes only one other large Power, such as France (or even France and Italy), since an alignment of West Germany and France in such a federation could dominate the small states completely. Accord- ingly, the small states want Britain, as a democratic counterweight to Germany, within anv West European federal structure. But De Gaulle, as he made evident in Januarv 1963, will accept Britain into a West Euro- pean federation onlv if Britain becomes clearlv a European Power and renounces its special relationship of close collaboration with the United States and if it is also willing to subordinate its position as leader of the British Commonwealth of Nations to its membership in the European system. The abandonment of its \"special relationship\" with the United States and with the Commonwealth, the two major concerns of the Eng- lish Establishment for more than forty years, was too heavy a price to pay for membership in the European Economic Community and would have been an unacceptable reversal of established policy in return for something that Britain sought without great enthusiasm. The integration of Western Europe began in 1948 as a consequence of the growth of Soviet aggression that culminated in the Prague coup and the Berlin blockade. The United States had offered Marshall Plan aid with the provision that the European recoverv be constructed on a cooperative basis. This led to the Convention for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) signed in April 1948 and the Hague Congress for European union held the following month. The OEEC, which eventually had eight- een countries as members and in 1961 was reorganized as the Organiza- tion for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), sought to administer American aid and further economic cooperation between sovereign states. The Hague meeting of .May 1948, with Winston Church- ill and Konrad Adenauer as its chief figures, called for a united Europe, and took a verv minor step in that direction by establishing a purely advisorv consultative body of ten (later fifteen) states, the Council of Europe, as a parliamentarv assembly at Strasbourg. These steps were clearlv inadequate. In 1950 Robert Schuman, then French foreign minister and later prime minister, who had been a German subject during World War I, suggested that a first step be taken toward a federation of Europe by putting the entire coal and steel production of France and Germany under a common High Authority. The real"},{"pageNumber":1299,"pageContent":"1284  TRAGEDY AND HOPE attraction of this project was that it would so integrate this basic industry that it would make any war between France and Germany \"physically impossible.\" One element in this project was to reconcile the anti-Ger- mans to the economic rehabilitation of Germany which the continued Soviet aggressions made increasingly necessary. It would also provide a solution to the Franco-German disagreement over the final disposition of the Saar. From this came the European Coal and Steel Community. This was a truly revolutionary organization, since it had sovereign powers, in- cluding the authority to raise funds outside any existing state's power. This treaty, which came into force in July 1952, brought the steel and coal industries of six countries (France, West Germany, Italy, and Benelux) under a single High Authority of nine members. This \"supra- national\" body had the right to control prices, channel investment, raise funds, allocate coal and steel during shortages, and fix production in times of surplus. Its power to raise funds for its own use by taxing each ton produced made it independent of governments. Moreover, its deci- sions were binding, and could be reached by majority vote without the unanimity required in most international organizations of sovereign states. The ECSC was a rudimentary government, since the High Authority was subject to the control of a Common Assembly, elected by the parliaments of the member states, which could force the Authority to resign by a two-thirds vote of censure, and it had a Court of Justice to settle disputes. .Most significantly, the ECSC Assembly became a genuine parliament with political party blocs—Christian-Democrats, Socialists, and liberals—sitting together independent of national origins. By 1958 the ECSC had abolished internal barriers to trade in oil and steel among the Six (such trade increased by 157 percent during the first five years) and had set up a common tariff against imports of coal and steel into the Six. Production of steel increased 65 percent during the five years, and the process of using ECSC funds to modernize the coal industry and to close down exhausted mines (moving hundreds of thou- sands of miners out of mining and into other employment) had begun. When the Korean War began in 1950, the United States demanded formation of twelve German divisions to strengthen NATO in Europe. The French, who feared any rebirth of German militarism, drew up an elaborate scheme for a European Defense Community (EDC) that would merge the German recruits into a European army under joint European control. Like ECSC, the European Defense Community was to be a supranational agency that would eventually take its place, along with the ECSC, within a European government. The general pattern of this super- government was established in the EDC project itself, with a bicameral European parliament and a president to preside over a European Cabinet Council. Unfortunately for these plans, the Left and the Right in the"},{"pageNumber":1300,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  1285  French Assembly joined together to reject the EDC treaty (August 1954). The Left was opposed to EDC because any union of Europe would re- duce Soviet influence on the Continent, while the Right, led by the Gaul- lists, were unwilling to see German armed forces reestablished without any guarantee that Britain and the United States would retain forces within Europe to balance the new German forces. Failure of Britain to recog- nize explicitly its inevitable commitment to European defense early in 1954 allowed EDC to die. A symbolic, but ineffectual, step was made to calm these French fears in September 1954, when Sir Anthony Eden instigated a Western Euro- pean Union (WEU) of seven states (the Six plus Britain) as a consulta- tive group to oversee German rearmament. As part of this agreement the British promised to keep four divisions in Europe until the year 2000 if necessary, but within three years one of these divisions was pulled out and the other three fell substantially below full strength. As a result of this agreement and a number of other factors, including recognition that the rearmament of Germany was inevitable, the French Assembly in December 1954 ratified the Paris Treaties that legalized the changes in Germany's status that France most feared. Western Germany regained its sovereign independence, obtained the right to have a na- tional army (although without nuclear weapons), and became an equal member of NATO. Having thus accepted much of what they did not want (an armed and sovereign Germany), it became clear to many Frenchmen that they must make a strenuous effort to get some of the things they did want (chiefly the merging of Germany into a West European system that would pre- vent the new German power from being used in a nationalistic aggres- sion). Accordingly, the Six met again, at Messina in June 1955. There they decided that the next step toward West European integration must be economic rather than political. From this flowed the Rome Treaty of A'larch 1957, which established the European Economic Community, bet- ter known as the Common Market, as well as the European Atomic Com- munity for joint exploitation of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes (Euratom). Both agreements went into effect at the beginning of 1958. The EEC Treaty, with 572 articles over almost 400 pages, like the treaties establishing ECSC and Euratom, looked forward to eventual politi- cal union in Europe, and sought economic integration as an essential step on the way. The project originated with the head of the French eco- nomic planning commission, Jean Monnet, whose ideas were pushed along by the energy of Foreign Minister Paul-Henri Spaak of Belgium. Within the three large nations, agreement was obtained by the efforts of the leaders of the respective Christian-Democratic parties: Adenauer, Schu- nian, and Alcide de Gasperi. The Catholic religious background of all three was a significant factor in their willingness to turn from nationalistic"},{"pageNumber":1301,"pageContent":"1286  TRAGEDY AND HOPE ro international economic methods, while Spaak's Socialist prestige helped to reconcile the moderate Left to the scheme. The slowing up of the process of economic recovery that had begun with the .Marshall Plan in 1949 helped to win widespread acceptance of the new effort for joint economic expansion. Briefly the Rome Treaty established the methods and time schedule by which the signatory countries, as well as other nations that might wish to join, could integrate their economies into a single, more expansive, system. Tariffs and other restrictions on trade between them were to be abolished by stages and replaced by a common tariff against the out- side world. At the same time, investment was to be directed so as to integrate their joint economy as a whole, with special attention to the in- dustrialization of backward and underdeveloped regions such as southern Italy. Special consideration was given to agriculture, largely detaching it from the market economy to cushion the integrative process while improving the standards of living and social protection of the farming population. As part of the integrative process there was to be free move- ment of persons, services, and capital within the Community, with gradual development of Community citizenship for workers. This whole process was to be achieved by stages over many years. The agricultural agree- ment, for example, was implemented by an elaborate agreement that was signed after 140 hours of almost continuous negotiation in January 1962. By the middle of that year the internal tariffs among members had been reduced in three stages to half their 1958 levels. The institutional organization for carrying on this process was similar to that set up for the ECSC and the abortive EDC: a European Parlia- mentary Assembly of supranational party blocs of Christian-Democrats, Socialists, and liberals sitting and voting together irrespective of national origins; a Council of .Ministers representing the member governments directly; an executive High Commission of nine that is enjoined by la %v to \"exercise their functions in complete independence\" of their national governments; a Court of Justice with powers to interpret the treaty and settle disputes; two advisory groups (the Monetary Committee and the Social and Economic Committee); a European Investment Bank to chan- nel funds for integrative and development purposes within the Com- munity; the Overseas Development Fund to do the same for former colonial territories now associated indirectly with the ECC; a European Social Fund for industrial retraining and unemployment compensation, and finally the two associated Communities (ECSC and Euratom). These last two were integrated with ECC from the fact that the Parliamentary Assembly, the Court of Justice, and the Council of Ministers are share' by all three communities. These organizations have some of the aspects of sovereignty from tne fact that their decisions do not have to be unanimous, are binding on state"},{"pageNumber":1302,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE INT PERSPECTIVE  1287  and on citizens who have not agreed to them, and can be financed by funds that may be levied without current consent of the persons being taxed. On the whole, the supranational aspects of these institutions will be strengthened in the future from provisions in the treaties them- selves. All this is very relevant to the remarks in the last chapter on the disintegration of the modern, unified sovereign state and the redistribution of its powers to multilevel hierarchical structures remotely resembling the structure of the Holy Roman Empire in the late medieval period. The impact of these tentative steps toward an integrative Europe has been spectacular, especially in the economic sphere. In general, the economic expansion of Western Europe, especially its industrial expansion, has been at rates far higher than those of Communist-dominated eastern Europe, with the EEC rates higher than those of non-EEC Western Euro- pean countries, and considerably higher than those of either Britain or the United States. By i960 the 300 million people of Western Europe had per capita incomes over a third higher than the 260 million persons in the same area had in 1938-1939. Industrial production more than doubled over the same time span, while agricultural production was a third larger with a smaller working force. This optimistic picture was even brighter for the Six of the EEC, whose general economic growth rate was con- siderably over 6 percent a year during the 1950's. This was more than double the rate of growth in the L T nited States, which was not much different from that in Britain. If these rates are maintained, it has been estimated that the income per head in the EEC Mould increase from about a third of the income per head in the L T nited States in i960 to more than half the United States income per head in 1970. The reasons for this relative boom in the EEC (and in Western Europe generally) in comparison with the slower economic dynamics of the English-speaking countries are of some importance. It does not seem to rest, as might appear at first glance, on a contrast between directed plan- ning and Iaissez faire, because, within the EEC, the French economy is fairly rigorously planned and the West German economy is surprisingly free, yet both have had high rates of growth. The West German condi- tions, however, have been misleading and have arisen very largely from artificially low wage levels and thus low costs of production, especially on articles for export into the international competitive market, such as Volkswagens. These low labor costs arose from the large number of East European refugees seeking work in Germany, a condition that will be of decreasing importance in the future. The conditions of economic growth in the EEC has been based on steady demand, high rates of investment, and liberal fiscal and financial policies. In 1961, for example, the rate of net investment in Britain was about 9 percent compared to the West German rate of about 17 percent. The high demand that spurred on this process arose from fiscal policies,"},{"pageNumber":1303,"pageContent":"1288  TRAGEDY AKD HOPE but also from the large new market of about ioo million persons pro- vided in EEC. In Britain and in the United States (with Canada) fiscal policies were much more conservative, with demand somewhat dampened down by efforts to balance budgets, to control inflation, and to influence both adverse balances of international pavments and the flows of domestic credit by conservative financial policies (notably, high interest rates). Moreover, in both countries, there was a good deal of unproductive ex- penditure either in misjudged enterprises and inefficient production or in defense and other nonproductive areas. As a consequence, not only have growth rates been low in the English-speaking countries but unemploy- ment rates have been high. In i960, for example, the United States unem- ployment rate was 5.4 percent and the Canadian 6.9 percent, while that of France was 1.3 percent and of West Germany only 0.9 percent. This sharp contrast between the prosperity of the EEC and the lan- guishing economv of Britain eventually brought the latter to a recogni- tion of the advantages of membership in the European system. But the decision was too late, based on wrong motives, and was eventually nul- lified by the imperious De Gaulle, who, like an elephant, never forgets an injury. Governments in London paid lip service to European unity and to British cooperation with it, but whenever an opportunity offered to take a real step toward European union, Britain balked. In the imme- diate postwar period, this reluctance was attributed to the rather provin- cial and doctrinaire Socialist outlook of the British Labour Party, but the situation did not improve when Winston Churchill returned to office in 1951. The general British outlook was that British participation in a united Europe was precluded by Britain's rather intangible and sentimental com- mitments to the Commonwealth and to the United States (that is, to the \"English-speaking idea\") and that a unification of Europe without Britain would be a threat to British markets on the Continent. This decision b> T Britain was copied by the Scandinavian and Baltic countries (Denmark and Finland), whose trade alliance with England went back to the crea- tion of the \"Sterling Bloc\" in 1932. In a similar way Britain refused to cooperate in the ECSC or EDC. This reluctance in London was a great tragedy, excluding Britain from the European growth toward economic prosperity, making it difficult or impossible for the European effort toward integration to make decisions that would have hastened the whole integrative process, and leaving Britain emphasizing Commonwealth and American relationships that were less and less prepared to give due weight to British ideas and power. 1° a sense Britain was making commitments to areas that were not prepared to make reciprocal commitments to Britain and would, if the occasion arose, leave Britain out on a limb. This, indeed, is exactly what happened in October 1956, when the United States threatened to throw its power"},{"pageNumber":1304,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  1289  and prestige against Britain's efforts in the Suez fiasco. And throughout the period, the chief Commonwealth countries, notably South Africa and Canada, made it perfectly clear that they were not willing to make any notable sacrifices for Britain's prosperity, and were reluctant to fol- low London's lead in many of the world's political issues of the period. In fact, even with Commonwealth preference and all the intangibles that link the Commonwealth together, Britain's trade and financial links with the Commonwealth are decreasing in importance, and the links of both with outsiders are increasing. For example, Nigeria and Ghana doubled their exports to EEC over the 1955—1959 period, while their exports to Britain decreased by 15 percent. On the whole, in recent years, the countries associated with the sterling area have found that association one of decreasing satisfaction. This is reflected in matters other than mar- ket conditions. Sterling itself has been subject to periodic crises since the war ended. The reason is obvious, for the United Kingdom tries to handle $12.3 billion in imports and $10.9 billion in floating short-term debts on a base of reserves of no more than $3 billion (in 1961), while, at the same time, the EEC, with $16 billion in reserves, had only $2 billion in short- term debts and handled $23.2 billion in imports. As a result of all this, London is decreasinglv attractive as a source of investment capital, while the EEC becomes increasingly prominent in that activity. And as a source of development funds for backward areas, the United Kingdom has ceased to be of major significance. In i960, for example, the United States provided $3,781 million and EEC provided $2,626 million, compared to the United Kingdom's $857 million and the rest of the OECD countries' S469 million. In fact Germany's $616 million was almost comparable to Britain's $857 million, with both far less than France's $1,287 million. Thus the Six provide about a third of the world's financial assistance to underdeveloped countries, while Britain provides only one-ninth. Considerations such as these help to indicate that the Commonwealth attachment to the United Kingdom is based rather on the intangibles of traditions and old patterns than on the solid advantages of today's eco- nomic and financial situation. The merging of the United Kingdom into the EEC would still give a fair jolt to economic life both in England and in the Commonwealth, but the slack would be taken up very rapidly. In fact, the rising demand for goods of higher quality in Japan will probably draw much of the export trade of New Zealand and Australia in butter, meat, or even wool from their older English-speaking markets even with- out Britain joining the Common Market. The reluctance of the English leadership to face these changing con- ditions, like their refusal to face the causes of Britain's economic lassi- tude, contributed much to confuse the situation that Europe, and espe- cially EEC, reached by the mid-1960's. In December 1956, in a vain effort to sidetrack European integration, British Foreign Secretary Selwyn"},{"pageNumber":1305,"pageContent":"I290  TRAGEDY AND HOPE Lloyd produced a \"Grand Design,\" a pompous name for an undigested scheme to dump an assortment of European consultative bodies into the Common Assembly of the Coal and Steel Community. This idea was gen- erally recognized as sabotage, and sank without a ripple. The next British effort was for a Free Trade Area; this was a scheme to permit British goods to enter the Common Market without Britain joining it. This was necessary, in British eves, because the joint external tariff of the ECC was to be higher than the tariffs of four of the Six had previously been, and would reduce British sales in those countries. The Free Trade Area plan was for an all-Europe free-trade zone embracing the Six along with all those who did not wish to join the EEC. That means that the Free Trade Area would abolish mutual trade barriers but would not establish a common external tariff. This British suggestion, made in November 1956, was regarded within EEC as another effort at sabotage, or, at best, a typical British attempt to have the advantages of both worlds by combining the abolition of European tariffs on British goods with continued British preference for Commonwealth foodstuffs. The lower prices on the latter (compared to food prices within the Six) would permit Britain to have lower wage costs and thus lower industrial prices to give British industry a competitive advantage in the unprotected Common .Market. When France, with West German support, broke off the Free Trade Area negotiations in December 1958, the British were left out of the EEC, which began to function in the ruins of the Free Trade Area. Britain re- acted by forming the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) of Britain, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, Portugal, and (later) Finland. This EFTA provided for mutual tariff reductions of member states by steps to complete abolition bv 1970, but the process added only 38 mil- lion persons to the existing British market of 52 million, and promised small prospect of any substantial increase in sales because the tariffs of most of these countries were already low on British goods. This could not compare with the EEC market of 170 million customers, but British public opinion, even in the 1960's, could not bring itself to accept the reorienta- tion of outlook required to view itself as a European state necessary to make it possible to accept the economic integration that could make th' s great market available to British industry. For this, the semislump ot 1960-1961 was needed, and only in July 1961 did the British government announce its readiness to start the complex negotiations needed for its joining the Common Market. By that late date, De Gaulle was well established in power in France, and was prepared to impose his 0*» peculiar point of view on the negotiations. The French economic resurgence, which the British so belatedly"},{"pageNumber":1306,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  1291  asked to join, was in no sense a consequence of De Gaulle's policies, nor were they synchronized, except accidentally, with the advent of De Gaulle and his Fifth French Republic on Alav 13, 1958. The basis for the French economic boom was laid under the Fourth French Republic, and De Gaulle amply profited from it. It might be said that the economic expansion, and its continuation after 1958, was based on those factors of the French system which the new De Gaulle regime left relatively un- changed—an educational structure accessible to anyone willing to work hard at his studies, the high quality of upper-level technical education, the close alliance between the administrative bureaucracy and the in- dustrial system, and the ease with which highly educated technicians can pass from one to the other; bv the readiness of the French mind to accept a rational, over-all view of life and its problems (this contributed con- siderably to the success of French economic planning), and by the whole concept of individual opportunity and careers open to talent within a structured social arrangement. All these go back to the Napoleonic period of French history and were, thus, well adapted to De Gaulle's personal inclinations. The fact that they are all quite alien to the English way of life also helps to explain the relative failure of the British economy in the Plan Era. The Fifth Republic was obviously tailored to De Gaulle's personal in- clinations, but it was also adapted to the bureaucratic substructure that had continued, as a semi-alien basis, to underlie the French political svstem in the bourgeois era. Worded in another way, we might sav that the shift of the Western world over the last three decades from a bourgeois to a technocratic pattern was well adapted to the subterranean bureau- cratic basis that had survived in France, more or less unobserved, during the centurv in which property was obviously triumphant. The bureauc- racv Louis XIV and Napoleon had built up had been directed toward totalitarian power and national glory; the age of property (roughlv 1836-1936) had sought to establish the influence of wealth unhampered by bureaucracy, and one of its chief aims had been to keep the bureau- cratic structure, the centralized French tradition of administration, and the forces of French rationalism outside the sphere of economics and nioneymaking. The economic depression of the 1930's and the defeat of 1940, both directly caused by the selfish interests and the narrow outlook (especially the narrow and selfish financial outlook) of the French bourgeoisie, made it clear that some new system was needed in France, just as the experience of the Resistance made it clear that some new svstem was needed in Europe. It was, in view of the French Nationalist and bureaucratic tradition, almost inevitable that the new domestic svstem would be a more integrated, more rational, and more bureaucratic one than that of the bourgeois era, although it is not so clear what this new system will establish as its goal. This, indeed, is the prob"},{"pageNumber":1307,"pageContent":"1292  TRAGEDY AND HOPE lem facing France today, a problem concerned with goals rather than with methods, since there is now a broad consensus (including the bourgeoisie) prepared to accept a rationalized, planned, bureaucratized society domi- nated bv a pervasive fiscalism, a kind of neomercantilism, but there is no consensus on what goals this new organization should seek. Onlv a verv small group of Frenchmen share De Gaulle's idea that the new svstem of France, the Fifth Republic, should make national power and glory its primary aim. A larger, and surprisingly influential, group, best represented bv Monnet, wishes to work for the kind of rational humanism or unified diversity that this volume has used as its chief cri- terion for judging historical change. This group hopes, by the proper organization of men and resources, to increase the production of wealth and to reduce the conflicts of power sufficiently to remove these dis- tracting matters from the center of human concern so that, once pros- perity and peace have been relatively secured, men will find the time and energy to turn to their more important ends of personality de- velopment, artistic expression, and intellectual exploration. This point of view, based on a significant distinction between what is necessary and what is important, hopes to find the opportunity to turn to important matters once the necessary ones have achieved a level of minimal satisfactions. The Frenchmen of a third group, which includes the major part of the population, have little concern with the goals of De Gaulle and even less with those of Monnet but are concerned with an almost repulsive pursuit of material affluence, something of which they had long heard but never considered achievable before. Today, for the first time, such affluence seems achievable to the great mass of Frenchmen as it does to the great mass of West Germans, to many English, and to increasing number 01 Italians. Americans and Swedes, who are already disillusioned with the fruits of affluence, must be indulgent to these recent arrivals in & e materialist rat race. The chief political aim of this large group is for political stability free from partisan upheavals, an end that De Gaulle and the Fifth Republic seem more capable of securing than the unstable, multipartied Fourth Republic. .Much of the ambiguity about De Gaulle rests on a failure of historical synchronisms. This can be seen in regard to the three aspects of (a) politi- cal ideology, (b) economic management, and (c) the relationship between these two. In the 1920's, all three of these were antipathetic to De Gaulle s outlook, since forty years ago the three were: (a) a democratic, n 8 \" tionalist, sovereign, independent state pursuing the goal of national self- interest; (b) a capitalistic economy; and (c) a laissez-faire relationship of no {jovernment in business. De Gaulle's ideas are rather those of Louis XIV, that is: (a) a sovereign, independent, authoritarian state pu r ' suing the goal of national glory; (b) a mixed economy of a corporate' 0 sort; and (c) political domination of economic life. The point of vieW"},{"pageNumber":1308,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  1293  of the \"new Europeans\" on these matters was: (a) a democratic, co- operative political structure of shared and divided powers on a Euro- pean basis, seeking peace and stability in an interlocking organizational structure rising through European, Atlantic-Western, and worldwide levels; (b) a mixed economy; and (c) a planned, state-directed drive to- ward increased affluence. De Gaulle cares only for (a) and has little inter- est in (b) or (c) so long as they provide him with a rate of economic expansion capable of supporting his ambitions in (a). The mass of French people care little about De Gaulle's ambitions in (a) so long as they obtain political stability that will allow them to seek the affluence they wish from (c); while the technicians, concerned largely with (b), are prepared to let De Gaulle seek glory in (a) and the people seek affluence in (c) so long as both leave them alone to manage the proper mixture of the economy they desire in (b). Thus France, by this most extraordinary mixture of cross-purposes, is led into the future by a man whose ideas in all three areas are almost completely obsolete. It is easy for English-speaking persons to condemn De Gaulle. Many of them consider his obsolescent ideas a danger to Europe and to the world. Indeed, they are, but this does not mean that they do not have some basis in De Gaulle's personal experience and in the recent history of France itself. The general was determined to restore the power and prestige of France as an independent state within a context of national states similar to that in which France had suffered the blows to its prestige in 1919-1945. To him these defeats were almost personal psychic injuries that could be repaired only by new French triumphs in the same nationalistic context and not by successes in an entirely different context such as that of an integrated Europe. Obsessed by the pursuit of the glory of France in the nationalistic era in which his own character had been formed and personally piqued by the rebuffs he had received in his own career, the rejection of his military advice by his superiors in the 1920's and 1930's, the defeats of France in the diplomatic and military arenas in the period 1936-1940, the rebuffs administered by the United States Department of State and the White House to his efforts to make himself the leader of the Free French in 1940-1943, and finally the gen- eral belittling, as he saw it, to his ideas and dignity during the liberation- all these served to make his outlook more remote, more rigid, and 'more opinionated until he came to regard himself as the God-given leader for a revived France and came to regard the English-speaking nations as the chief obstacles in his path to this end. The culmination of De Gaulle's irritation with the United States came during the five years 1953-1958, during which he was retired from pub- lic life and had to watch, in helpless impotence, John Foster Dulles's studied belittling of France's role in world affairs. The American Secretary °f State's unilateralism and \"brinkmanship,\" his emphasis on the Far East"},{"pageNumber":1309,"pageContent":"1294  TRAGEDY AND HOPE and his ignoring of Europe, his refusal to consult with his NATO allies, and his lack of sympathy for the French position in Indochina, Algeria, and Europe itself—all this drove De Gaulle into an icy antipathy for American policy and a conviction that the interests of France could be protected only by France itself and could be furthered as well by col- laboration with the Soviet Union as by alliance with the United States. De Gaulle was especially irritated by the American lack of concern for French and European interests in nuclear-weapons policy. Dulles's willingness to go to war with the Communist Powers over Asiatic ques- tions (such as the Chinese offshore islands or the Formosa Strait) without consultation with its European allies, when the most immediate conse- quence of any Soviet-American war would be a Russian attack on Europe and the exposure of France to a threat of nuclear attack over an issue on which Paris had not even been consulted gave De Gaulle (perfectly justi- fiably) profound irritation. When the disruption of French political life over the Algerian dispute brought De Gaulle back to public life as premier in June 1958, he took steps to end this situation. What he wanted was a \"Western troika,\" that is, a tripartite consultation of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France on all world disputes that could involve NATO in war in Europe. In this way he hoped to prevent in the future such events as Dulles's unilateral cancellation of the American offer of credits for the Aswan Dam that had led to the Suez crisis of 1956. This suggestion by De Gaulle was rebuffed, and led by logical steps to his decision to dis- entangle France from its NATO obligations and to establish an inde- pendent French nuclear force de frappe, According to De Gaulle's line of thought, Washington not only ig\" nored French interests and ideas on a worldwide basis, but involved & without consultation, in the risk of war in Europe. The general also argued that the growth of nuclear stalemate between the United States and the Soviet Union left Europe unprotected so long as it based it s security on an American threat of nuclear war with the Soviet Union- Washington, he felt, would not reply to a Soviet aggression in Europe by any nuclear attack on the Soviet Union when it realized that the Soviet counterreply to such an attack would be the nuclear devastation 0 American cities by Soviet missiles. Why, according to De Gaulle, WPV c the United States destroy its own cities in retaliation for a Soviet ag- gression, at any level, on Europe? This opened the whole problem P \"nuclear credibility,\" with De Gaulle at such a high level of skepticism of American good faith that he saw little credibility and thus little deter- rent value in the American threat to use nuclear weapons against t Soviet Union to defend France. According to De Gaulle, the only sea\" French defense must be based on France's own military power, VjfU must, inevitably, be nuclear power."},{"pageNumber":1310,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IX PERSPECTIVE  I 295 At first glance, the idea of modest French nuclear armaments serving as deterrence to the mighty Soviet threat to Europe, either conventional or nuclear, seems even less credible. But De Gaulle was one of the first to recognize, as a feasible policy, an idea that was subsequently adopted by the Soviet Union itself. This was the idea that a nuclear deterrence does not require the possession of overwhelming nuclear power or even the nuclear superiority in which Washington long believed, but may be based on the capacity to inflict unacceptable nuclear damage. In De Gaulle's mind, the explosion of French hydrogen bombs over three or four major Soviet cities, including Moscow, would constitute unac- ceptable damage in the Kremlin's eves and would thus provide effective deterrence against a Soviet aggression in Europe (or at least against France) without any need for France to relv on any uncertain American response. To provide for such a French threat of nuclear response to Soviet ag- gression, De Gaulle's regime accepted the great economic and financial burden of obtaining a force de frappe. In its first stage, to be achieved by 1966, this would consist of 62 Mirage IV supersonic manned jet bomb- ing planes to carry France's first-generation, 6o-kiloton plutonium bombs. By the end of 1964, when twenty of these planes were operational, they were being produced at a rate of one a month and were being matched by the production of one bomb a month from the atomic pile at Marcoule. By 1966 the power of the bomb is expected to increase to its maximum size of about 300 kilotons. The Alirage IV, as vehicle for the French nuclear threat, will be re- placed by twenty-five land-based missiles fired from underground silos. These will be operational about 1969, and will shift their warheads from A-bombs to H-bombs some time in the early 1970's. The third generation of French nuclear weapons will probably be Polaris-type nuclear sub- marines to become opez - ational some time in the 1970's. If these can be speeded up and the Alirage IV could be retained, it is possible that the brief transition stage of land-based missiles might be skipped completely. The total nuclear submarine fleet will probably not exceed three vessels, even in the late 1970*5. These plans do not seem impressive in comparison with the nuclear armament of the two Superpowers, but they are expected to make France an independent nuclear Power and allow it to exercise an independent nuclear deterrence. How ever, if countermeasures, such as the development of an anti-missile missile, become more successful, the additional pene- tration devices needed to allow the French nuclear threat to be credible may raise the financial cost of the whole effort to a level that would put a v erv severe strain on the French budget. In that case, France must either give up the effort or try to persuade the European Community to do it as a joint effort. (This might re-activate the West European Union or fall"},{"pageNumber":1311,"pageContent":"1296  TRAGEDY AND HOPE to the largest fragment of a divided NATO.) But in this case, France, despite De Gaulle, will have to accept some kind of European political union. All of this points up the fact that the future political and military struc- ture of Europe revolves about two quite separate problems: (1) Will it be a united Europe or a Europe of national states? (as De Gaulle wants), and (2) Will it be aligned with the United States or will it be an in- dependent neutralist factor in the Cold War? The United States wants Europe to be united and allied; De Gaulle wants it to be disunited and independent; the Kremlin wants it disunited and neutral; London's policy, until i960, was to see it disunited and allied to the Atlantic system. It seems likelv, for reasons already given, that Europe's interests and those of the world as a whole might be served best if Europe could be united and independent. .Moreover, in view of the conflicting forces involved, it seems very likely that Europe, after a considerable delay caused by De Gaulle, will finally emerge as united and independent. Thus the future of Europe, like that of France itself, depended, in the mid-1960's, on De Gaulle's continuance in office. This was ensured, at least until the next presidential election in 1965, unless interrupted by death, by the fact that no alternative to De Gaulle could be seen clearly even by his opponents. In the early 1960's, the political pattern of France was dominated by four factors: (1) the terrorism of the ex- treme Right, led by the Secret Army Organization (OAS), which resisted the Algerian settlement even after it was completed in 1 962 and made several efforts to assassinate De Gaulle; (2) the disorganization and discontent of the older political leaders as De Gaulle continued to change French politics to a simple administrative structure with himself as an almost monarchical figure standing as a symbol of France above political considerations; (3) the steady, if not always enthusiastic, support of De Gaulle bv the passive mass of Frenchmen who saw the general as a center of solidity in the middle of a sea of confusions; and (4) the unpredictable and despotic control of the political initiative by De Gaulle himself. The chief discontents came in i960 and 1961 from those groups in the population, notably farmers, civil servants, and university students, who found that they were sharing in the economic boom less th* B others or were being squeezed bv its dynamics. The price inflation or about 50 percent in the decade following 1953 injured government em- ployees, v hose salaries did not rise as rapidly as prices; university SW\" dents were also squeezed by the inflation but were squeezed much more literally in housing, eating accommodations, and classroom spa cC by a great increase in enrollments which was not sufficiently prepared for by government efforts to increase facilities. And the peasants, en- couraged by government technocrats to modernize their methods,"},{"pageNumber":1312,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  1297  found that increased production led to lower farm prices and decreased incomes for themselves. In view of the authoritarian character of the De Gaulle regime, these discontents tended to become extralegal agitations. There were sporadic strikes, protest parades, and even riots of these groups to call public attention to their grievances. Farmers were particularly violent when agricultural prices decreased and industrial prices continued to inch upward. The Gaullist government hoped to remedy the situation by reducing the costs of distribution through middlemen and thus provide French farmers with an increasing share of the reduced price of produce to the consumer, but on the whole the incredibly inefficient distribution of French farm produce, which forced most produce, regardless of source or destination, to pass through the Parisian markets, was too difficult a problem even for De Gaulle's experts, at least in any time interval that mattered. To obtain concessions, the farmers rioted, often on a large scale, such as an outburst of 35,000 of them at Amiens in February i960. They blocked national automobile routes with their tractors, spread unsold or unremuneratively priced farm produce over the roads or city streets, and responded with violence when efforts were made to disperse them. Through this whole period, De Gaulle's conduct of the government, through his handpicked prime ministers, made a shambles of the Fifth Republic constitution, which had been tailored to his specifications. Since a government could not be overthrown bv defeat of a bill but only bv a specific vote of censure, and this latter would lead to a general election in which all of De Gaulle's prestige could be used against those who had voted for the censure, the ordinary deputy's love of office and reluctance to wage an expensive and risky electoral campaign made it possible for De Gaulle's premiers to obtain almost any law he desired. The older political leaders were very restive under this system but could mobilize no organized opposition to it, because no one could see any real alternative to De Gaulle. A significant example of De Gaulle's high-handed operations may be seen in the way he forced through the bill to create an independent French nuclear force without allowing the Assembly to debate the issue or to vote on the bill itself (November-December i960). This was done under Article 49 of the constitution, which allows the govern- ment to pass a bill on its own responsibility without consideration by the Assembly unless a vote of censure is passed by a majority (277) of all the deputies. By use of this article, the three readings of the Nuclear Arms bill were replaced by three motions of censure that obtained no more than 2 15 votes. There seems to have been a clear majority, both in the Assembly and in the country as a whole, against the nuclear force, but few were willing to risk the fall of the government with"},{"pageNumber":1313,"pageContent":"1298  TRAGEDY AND HOPE no acceptable alternative in sight, and even fewer were willing to precipitate a general election. As might be expected in such a system, the danger of assassination as a method for changing a government increased greatly, but De Gaulle continued on his imperturbable course in spite of a number of attempts on his life. One of the chief dangers to the Gaullist regime came from the discontent of the highest officers in the armed forces, but the mutiny and revolt of several army contingents in Algeria in April 1961 showed fairly clearlv that this opposition movement was largely re- stricted to the highest officers, and De Gaulle was able to eliminate them and thus to reduce them, like the rest of his opponents, to angry impotence or to assassination efforts. De Gaulle's success in retiring from public life the only surviving Marshal of France, Alphonse Juin, clinched his superiority over the army. Equally successful, and typical of De Gaulle's actions, were his con- stant appeals to public opinion, by television or on personal regional tours, or bv local elections or plebiscites, against the disunited opposi- tion, especially against the traditional political party leaders. A success- ful example of these techniques occurred in 1962 when De Gaulle decided to change the method of electing the president (or reelecting himself) from the constitutional method of choice by an electoral college of 80,000 \"notables\" to election bv popular vote. To bypass the Senate, which was constitutionally entitled to vote on such matters and would unquestionably reject the change, De Gaulle announced that the amend- ment would be submitted to a popular referendum of the whole elector- ate. This method of changing the constitution by referendum was denounced as unconstitutional by all the political parties except his own, and was declared illegal bv the Council of State. Gaston Monnerville, president of the senate, who would become president of France if De Gaulle died, denounced the referendum a s illegal, and accused De Gaulle of \"malfeasance.\" When De Gaulle s rage at Monnerville became evident, the Senate reelected Monnerville as its presiding officer with only three dissenting votes. The Assembly, ' n an overnight session, October 4-5, 1962, passed a vote of censure with 280 votes. Bv the referendum on the constitutional change, on October 28, 1962, De Gaulle achieved his purpose with almost 62 percent of the votes registering \"aves\" (this was only 46 percent of the regisrere votes because of the 23 percent nonvoting) in spite of the fact H» his proposal was opposed by all political parties except his own. The following month, November 1962, in the general election made neces- sary bv the vote of censure, De Gaulle's bloc won 234 seats out 0 480, with an additional 41 seats committed to his support. The Riff\" was practically wiped out in the election, although the Communists increased slightly to 41 seats."},{"pageNumber":1314,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  1299  This pattern of personal and rather arbitrary rule, opposed bv the older ruling groups but sustained by the ordinary Frenchman whenever De Gaulle asked for such support, has continued to be the pattern of De Gaulle's political system, and will undoubtedly continue unless he meets some unforeseen sharp diplomatic defeat or a domestic economic collapse. Both of these are unlikely at the present time. While French political life passed through these stages of superficial drama and fundamental boredom, British political life wallowed in a malaise of mediocritv. No groups were actually discontented, and cer- tainly none was enthusiastic about the situation in Britain over the 1957—1964 period leading up to the General Election of October 1964. The Conservative Government came to office in 1951, was returned in the elections of 1955, and returned again in the elections of October 1959. Anthonv Eden served a brief and rather unsuccessful prime ministership from the retirement of Winston Churchill in April 1955 until his own retirement in favor of Harold Macmillan in January '957- The latter's term of office had no spectacular failures such as Eden had experienced in the Suez Crisis of October 1956, but on the whole there were also no great successes. Macmillan sought to avoid issues if possible, to strengthen contacts with the United States and the Commonwealth by personal diplomacy, to follow Washington's policy as closely as possible without appearing openly obsequious, and to hold a fairly tight rein over the Conservative Party and the House of Commons. An endless series of nastv little problems were met and somehow disposed of, to be followed by the rise of similar problems without any significant changes of course or speed. Abroad, the chief problems arose from the demands of various areas within the Commonwealth for self-government and the intrusion of the racial issue into these disputes, especially in Central Africa, East Africa, British Guiana, and Malaya. The chief problems at home were equally endless and Mere concerned with the continual weakness of the pound sterling on the foreign exchange market and the social prob- lems associated with the British economic expansion, such as increased Vehicular traffic, spreading juvenile and adolescent delinquency, an apparent decline in the level of adult moral behavior, and the growing attacks, especially in industry and finance, on the economic bases of tlie older Establishment. In general, there was a slow spreading disillusionment with the structure of English society, especially with the continued dominance by the old established families of political and economic life. This was especially notable among the middle and lower middle classes, while the lower class was, apparently, less antagonistic because of the con-"},{"pageNumber":1315,"pageContent":"1300  TRAGEDY AND HOPE tinued relative prosperity and, above all, from the weakening of what might be called the Labour Party ideology of class conflict. In spite of a weakening of class antagonisms, there was a spreading rejection of the established class structure of England as it had existed for about a centurv. The good manners of the lower and middle classes, which had made visits to England such a pleasure, have slowly worsened, since they have come to be regarded as a mark of acceptance of the rigid class structure of the country, something that is decreasing in all classes. This shift is evident even in legislation, such as an Act of 1963, permitting peers to give up their titles in order to run for office in the House of Commons. It is, perhaps, most threatening in the ani- mositv expressed by some of the new class of very rich who reject the established social prestige of the older aristocratic families. This last point is of some importance, for it may mark the end of a very significant period of English history. In this history the English social structure was retained because of its flexibility rather than its rigiditv. Access to higher social levels had never been closed to those with the energy and luck to work upward. These climbers invariably became strong defenders of the class structure, buying country houses, sending their children to boarding schools, and adopting the accent and other distinctive idiosyncrasies of the English upper classes. This \"aping of their betters\" on all levels preserved the English class struc- ture and provided the relatively frictionless character of English social life. Frictions have now appeared at the very time that class antagon- isms have been weakened. The reason for this has been the slow spread- ing in Britain of a kind of individualistic and nominalistic outlook that had been prevalent in much of the Western world for several genera- tions but had been plaved down in Britain, until the last decade or so, by the pressures to conform on those who wished to rise socially and even on those who wished to remain in their same social level. As a result, traditionally in England, individualists have been eccentrics, that is, persons so well established that their social positions could not be changed notably by their personal behavior. This is now changing- Increasingly, those who wish to remain in their social status and, most significantly, a surprising number of those who are rising in the economic, academic, and political hierarchies feel called upon to re- ject in an explicit fashion the established class structure. This began with the writings of Labour Party intellectuals early in the century; but it has now become so widespread that rising young men today still continue to rise without conforming to the established behaviorial panerns of their aspirant levels. One reason for this, of course, is that control of the ladders to success are no longer so closely held. In the old days, the merchant bankers of London, EC2, controlled fairly well the funds that were needed for almost any enterprise to become a"},{"pageNumber":1316,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  I30T  substantial success. Today much larger funds are available from many diverse sources, from abroad, from government sources, from insur- ance and pension funds, from profits of other enterprises, and from other sources. These are no longer held under closely associated con- trols and are much more impersonal and professionalized in their dis- posal, so that, on the whole, an energetic man (or a group with a good idea) can get access to larger funds today and can do so without any- one much caring if he accepts the established social precedents. At the same time, on lower levels, young men working their way upward, although not, perhaps, to \"the top,\" no longer conform in dress and behavior to the expected patterns of respectability of their social aspirations, but often show a more or less open defiance of these. The most obvious, and in a way most frightening, examples of this are to be found in the open defiance of all respectability by adolescents and post-adolescents of various social levels, but chiefly low ones, who have rioted by the thousands at various seaside resorts on long week- ends in recent years. These most obvious examples of rebellion against English conformity are, however, not nearly so significant as the less obvious, but much more significant, rejections of the established system by men whose training and positions would lead us to expect that they would be firm supporters of it. This includes men like the following: (i) John Grigg, who disclaimed his title of Lord Altrincham in 1963, was educated at Eton and New College, was in the Grenadier Guards, edited the Na- tional Review (which had been acquired from Lady Milner), and was close to the Establishment from his father's long-time associations with the Milner Group, the Times, the Round Table, and his intimate friendship with Lord Brand; the son shocked the Court by his open criticism of the Queen's social associations as undemocratic; and his Weekly articles for the Guardian advocated, among other things, aboli- tion of a hereditary House of Lords; or (2) Goronwy Rees of New College and All Souls who had denounced the English amateur tradi- tion in government and business as a \"cult of incompetence,\" and de- manded, to replace it, a system of training and recruitment that will provide a British managerial class marked by professional competence rather than by what he regards as \"frivolity\"; or (3) John Vaizey, one-time Scholar of Queens College, Cambridge and now Fellow of Worcester College, Oxford, who denounces the whole English educa- tional system as inadequate and misguided and would replace it with something more like the French openly competitive system of free education. One, perhaps surprising, voice in this criticism, aimed at attitudes rather than class structure, has been that of Prince Philip. He has tried, with only moderate success, to introduce srienrists, technicians, and"},{"pageNumber":1317,"pageContent":"1302  TRAGEDY AND HOPE managerial types into Court circles (at least occasionally), but these circles continue, as in the past, to be dominated by the old rural upper- class interests of horses, hunting, and parlor games. At the same time, by a series of calculated indiscretions, His Royal Highness has sought to encourage the change of attitude that so many feel is essential to the continued survival of Britain in an era of advanced technology. Samples of his statements continue to be quoted, especially in circles that disapprove of them. In February 1961, the Prince said, \"If anyone has a new idea in this country, there are twice as many people who advocate putting a man with a red flag in front of it,\" and eighteen months later, in a speech on Britain's inability to remain competitive in the world's export markets, he said, \". . . we are suffering a national defeat comparable to an)' lost military campaign, and, what is more, a self-inflicted one. . . . The bastions of the smug and the stick-in-the- mud can only be toppled by persistent undermining. . . .\" These criti- cisms of complacency, now a chronic disease of the British upper classes, have had relatively small influence, at least in those circles where they are most needed and where they are discreetly regarded as \"unfortunate remarks.\" However, the volume of such criticism, especially on relatively high levels of the established hierarchies, has been growing, and must eventually force significant changes of outlook and behavior. They are more effective evidence of the breakdown of established outlooks than more spectacular events, like the antics of juvenile rioters or even the sinful lives of Cabinet ministers exposed in the popular press for the whole world to see, as was done of the war minister's encounters with a teenage prostitute whom he met (of all places) at Lady Astor's \"Cliveden\" estate. It seems possible, however, that any constructive change in England will be so long delayed that it may be anticipated by waves of unconstructive change, especially the rapid spread of frantic materialism, self-indulgence, and undisciplined individualism. That this should occur in the country that offered the world of the twentieth century its finest examples of self-disciplined response to the calls of social dutv would, indeed, be a profound tragedy. It would seem that Britain, perhaps more than any other European country except Sweden, is passing through a critical phase where rt does not know what it wants or what it should seek. The patterns of outlook and behavior that brought it to world leadership by 1880 were going to seed by 1938. There was sufficient vitality still left in them to bring forth the magnificent effort of 1940-1945, but since 1945 it has become clear that the old patterns are not adapted to success in the contemporary world of technocracy, operations research, rationaliza- tion, and mass mobilization of resources. The British method of operat- ing through a small elite, coordinated by leisurely personal contact and"},{"pageNumber":1318,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  1303  shared outlooks, and trained in the humanities, cannot handle the problems of the late twentieth century. Britain has the quality to do this, for, as we have seen, operations research, jet engines, radar, and many of the technological advances that helped create the contemporary world originated in Britain; but these things must be available on a mass basis for any country wishing to retain a position of substantial world leadership today, and they cannot be made available in Britain on a quantity basis by any continuation of the patterns of training and recruitment used by Britain in the nineteenth century. There are those who say in all sincerity that there is no need for Britain to seek to retain a position of leadership that would require it to destroy everything that made the country distinctive. These people are prepared to abandon world leadership, international influence, and economic expansion for the sake of preserving the late nineteenth-cen- tury patterns of life and society. But pressures from outside as well as from within make this impossible. Lycurgus renounced social change in prehistoric Sparta only by militarizing the society. Britain certainly cannot refuse to change and at the same time hope to retain the leisurely, semiaristocratic, informally improvising social structure of its recent past. The outside world is not prepared to allow this, and, above all, the mass of British people will not allow it. In fact, the reluctance of the Conservative Party under Macmillan to face up to this problem has pushed a large number of British voters, reluctantly, toward the Labour Party. As a result, Labour won the election of October 1964 by a bare majority of the House of Commons. It is widely agreed that Britain's problems in facing the contemporary world fall under two headings: (a) a rather complacent lack of enter- prise and (b) an educational system that is not adapted to the con- temporary world. The lack of enterprise is rooted in the self-satisfied attitude of the established elite, especially in their rather unimaginative attitude toward industry and business. For example, at the time that the Volkswagen was sweeping the American small-car import markets, the British Motor Corporation had in the Morris Minor a car that was slightly inferior in a few points, superior on several important points, and sold for several hundred dollars less, yet no real effort was made by the British firm to fight for a share of the American market. Critics of contemporary England tend to concentrate their fire on the educational system, which, despite great changes, remains inade- quate, in the sense that large numbers of young people are not being trained for the tasks that have to be done, especially for teaching itself. To be sure, Britain has provided about three billion dollars on new educational buildings since the war, with about a hundred thousand more teachers, an extension in the school-leaving age of about eighteen months, and a sixfold increase in opportunities for higher education"},{"pageNumber":1319,"pageContent":"1304  TRAGEDY AND HOPE (with new universities being established in provincial towns almost yearly); but the subjects studied, the methods used, and the attitudes toward these are not directed toward the needs of the future world; no real coordination or ready access is provided between the educa- tional system and the world of action, and access to either by the ordinary Englishman remains restricted by social and economic bar- riers. Instead of the gradual elimination of those who are unwilling to study, such as operates in theory in France and to a lesser extent in the United States, Britain still has barriers at ages eleven and eighteen that shunt the major part of the country's young people into terminat- ing and specialized curricula, and do so on largely irrelevant criteria, such as ability to pay or social background. A survey of more than four thousand children, reported by Thomas Pakenham in The Ob- server, concluded that \"the 11-plus examination and our selective edu- cational system itself are seriously biased in favour of middle-class children and against virtually all those from poorer families.\" Using I.Q. tests that are themselves biased in favor of middle-class children, the survey showed that of all eight-year-old children with I.Q.'s of 105, only 12 percent of lower-class children were subsequently able to get to grammar schools, while 46 percent of those from the middle class could get to grammar schools (and thus get access to a curriculum preparing for college). Of eight-year-olds with I.Q.'s of 111, 30 percent from the lower class but 60 percent of a higher social background subsequently reached grammar school. And of those exceptional children with I.Q.'s above 126, about 82 percent of both social levels get to gram- mar school. These figures are taken from a recent volume, edited by Arthur Koestler, entitled Suicide of a Nation? (Hutchinson, 1963). The sig- nificance of the volume does not rest so much in what it savs as in the fact that a team of writers, including Koestler, Hugh Seton-Watson, .Malcolm .Muggeridge, Cyril Connolly, Austen Albu, M.P., Henry Fairlie, John .Mander, .Michael Shanks, and others, could contribute to a volume with the rhetorical title borne by this one. Several of these writers apply to the ruling groups of contemporary Britain the designation that Gil' bert .Murray, more than a generation ago, taught their elders to use with reference to ancient Athens: \"a failure of nerve.\" There may indeed l» e a failure of nerve in both historical cases, but there is equally evident a failure of imagination and of energy. For the Britain that won glory i' 1 World War II had many opportunities to do great things in the postwar period but failed to do so because its leaders were unwilling to grasp the opportunity. On the whole, the two contending political parties in Britain continue to offer the mass of English voters opposing visions that have no real"},{"pageNumber":1320,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  1305  appeal to the great majority of English, and, at the same time, show an obvious disinclination to take drastic action to realize these visions, prob- ably because party leaders know that their views are repugnant to the majority. These two opposed visions offer, on the one hand, the nostalgic yearn- ings of the Conservatives for the world of 1908 and, on the other side, the state Socialism and unilateral disarmament of the Labour Party doc- trinaires. Neither of these has much to contribute to the real problems facing Britain in the last half of the twentieth century, which is why the mass of British voters, who can detect irrelevance even when they them- selves have no clear knowledge of what is relevant, have little enthusiasm for either. The Conservative standpatters were challenged by a number of vigorous and able veterans of World War II, such as Iain Macleod, Peter Thorneycroft, Quintin Hogg (Lord Hailsham), Reginald Alaudling, Enoch Powell, Ted Heath, and others. These were essentially empiricists, but thev wanted Conservatism to make an active attack on Britain's problems and to make their party more appealing to the great mass of Englishmen by associating it with vigor and a social conscience. In one way or another, Alacmillan was able to sidetrack all of these, to derail the traditional leader of the older aristocratic Conservative fam- ilies, Lord Salisbury, and to block other significant contenders for control of the party such as R. A. Butler. In fact, Maemillan's eagerness to avoid decisions or activity in matters concerned with the welfare of the coun- try was exceeded onlv by his activity in consolidating his own personal power in the partv. In some ways, notably in his insatiable yearning for power, his skill in concealing this fact, and his evident lack of any very rigid principles on other matters, Alacmillan recalled his predecessor, Baldwin. Both had the same pose as typical country squires and both had Oxford University closer to their hearts than any other public issue. But where Baldwin was lethargic and relatively sensitive, Alacmillan was active and secretly ruthless, quite willing, apparently, to disrupt the Establish- ment or the party itself to further his personal position and his surprisingly narrow social interests. This was seen in his last-minute, successful, cam- paign against Sir Oliver Franks for the honorary position of Chancellor of Oxford University in i960 and in the way in which, operating from a hospital bed in 1963, he pushed aside all other claimants to be his suc- cessor as prime minister to put into that office the fourteenth Earl of Home, Alexander Frederick Douglas-Home. This disregard of tradition, of the lines of expected procedure, of the claims of past service and co- operation, and, above all, of the expectations of public opinion in order to raise a man whose chief claim seemed to many to be based on long lineage was a fair commentary on Alacmillan's attitude toward his office and his party. Its influence on the morale of the party itself cannot be assessed, but it cannot have been a good one."},{"pageNumber":1321,"pageContent":"1306  TRAGEDY AND HOPE The Labour Party Has similarly divided, and similarly fell under the control of a man whose will to power was stronger than any ideology or party principles. On the whole the party was split between leaders of labor-union origin and intellectuals from jobs in university teaching. At the same time, it was split beween those who still saw some merit in the old theories of class struggles and imperialist wars and felt that the solutions to both was to be found in nationalization of industry and dras- tic, if not unilateral, disarmament (at least in regard to nuclear weapons). The postwar world, in Britain as elsewhere, violated all the anticipations of Socialist Party theories. The former Socialist Utopia, the Soviet Union, became the archenemy, and the United States, previously regarded as the epitome of capitalist corruption, became a combination of St. George and Santa Claus; the postwar experience with nationalization disillusioned all but the most doctrinaire of Socialists, and the majority of voters, once they had obtained the basic elements of social welfare, medical care, and social insurance in the immediate postwar period, showed a strange pref- erence for moderate or even Conservative leaders rather than for the advocates of Left-wing policies. As a consequence of these experiences, the Labour Party tended to split into a major wing that sought to win votes and office by appeals to moderation and a minor wing that sought to repeat the older war cries for seeking working-class benefits through class legislation and na- tionalization. The disappearance from the scene of the prewar Labour Party leaders, such as Clement Atlee, Ernest Bevin, and Hugh Dalton, made Hugh Gaitskell leader of the party and of its moderate wing. By 1956 Gaitskell was being challenged from the Left by Frank Cousins, a former miner, who was backed bv a million votes in the Transport and General Workers Union. At the Party Conference of i960 Gaitskell was defeated on four resolutions favoring unilateral disarmament and reject- ing British cooperation with NATO, which were passed over his ob- jections. Gaitskell was able to reverse these votes in 1961, but could not wipe from the public mind the impression that the party might not be completely reliable in support of Britain's role in the defense of the West against Communist aggressions. While still concerned with this task, Gaitskell died earlv in 1963, and was succeeded as party leader by Harold Wilson, whose brilliant record as student and teacher did not hamper lu s work as a skilled and tireless manipulator of intraparty political influence. From 1959 onward, a small but steady sagging in popular support ft> r the Conservatives was evident. The party delayed calling a new election until the very end of the five-year term of the Parliament's life in the vain hope that some success, or at least some decisive improvement i' 1 Britain's economic condition, might provide the margin for an ufl\" precedented fourth consecutive electoral victory. By late 1960 it \\ v:lS clear that some decisive step must be taken to regain popular support"},{"pageNumber":1322,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  1307  Macmillan was driven, still with reluctance, to seek membership for Britain in the booming European Economic Community. Application was made in August 1961, opening many months of onerous negotiations. During this period De Gaulle made a spectacular state visit to West Ger- many, spoke of the national glories of Germany, and persuaded Chan- cellor Adenauer to sign a special treaty of Franco-German friendship, whose real meaning Mas ambiguous to all concerned, except that it seemed to exclude both the great English-speaking Powers from the inner Euro- pean circle. The latter two reaffirmed their solidarity—in what looked to some like British inferiority to Washington—in a conference between Macmillan and President Kennedy in the Bahamas in December 1962. The Nassau Conference sought to iron out various Anglo-American differences, to agree on steps that might avert De Gaulle's steadv weak- ening of NATO, and, on Macmillan's part, to show the British electorate the Conservative leader's close relations with President Kennedy. The meeting confirmed an American decision to abandon the \"Skvbolt,\" an air-to-ground missile on which the British had constructed much of their nuclear defense, and proposed to strengthen NATO bv establishing a \"multinational force.\" The latter project hoped to establish NATO's strategic nuclear force in a fleet of surface naval vessels, armed with Polaris-tvpe missiles and operated bv mixed crews from all the NATO Powers. These mixed crews would prevent France from continuing its divisive policies within the NATO military array, increase the cohesion of Europe, give its nuclear strategy at least an appearance of independ- ence from the United States, and provide the groundwork for some kind of European Defense Community, including Britain, if France split NATO completely. De Gaulle's answer to this weak and symbolic gesture of Anglo- American cooperation was decisive. Within less than a month, in January 1963, he rejected the British seventeen-month-old application to join the EEC. This resounding defeat to Macmillan and the United States was delivered in typical De Gaulle fashion. In superb disregard of the established EEC procedures for dealing with applications for member- ship, De Gaulle, at a personal press conference, announced that France would oppose the British request, on the grounds that it was a belated effort to get into a system that the British had earlier sought to impede with their rival Outer Seven Free Trade Area and that Britain was not yet readv for admission to anv purelv European svstcm since, as he said, \"Britain, in effect, is insular, maritime, and linked bv her trade, her markets, and her supoliers to a great variety of countries, manv of them distant . . . fso that] the nature, structure, and circumstances of Britain differ profoundly- from those of continental states.\" If Britain were ad- mitted to EEC, according to De Gaulle, she would at once seek to bring in all the other members of OECD, and \"in the end there would appear"},{"pageNumber":1323,"pageContent":"I308  TRAGEDY AND HOPE a colossal Atlantic community under American dominance and leader- ship which would completely swallow up the European Community.\" The other five EEC nations, with Britain and the United States, op- posed De Gaulle's efforts to break off the Brussels talks on the British application for membership, but on January 29, 1963, the French vetoed continuance of the discussion, and the British application was, in effect, rejected. The De Gaulle veto suspended indefinitely the movement toward Eu- rope's political unity. At the same time, De Gaulle rejected the Anglo- American suggestion for a multinational nuclear force within NATO. On January 22, 1963, with President Adenauer of West Germany, he signed the French-German Treaty of friendship and consultation, pro- viding periodic conferences of the two countries on foreign policy, de- fense, and cultural matters. Before the end of the month, over strong Labour Party opposition, the British Parliament approved the Anglo- American Nassau Pact and heard Prime Minister Macmillan announce his government's determination to build an independent nuclear force of four or five British-built Polaris submarines by purchasing the necessary equipment from the United States. In this way, the movement for European unity was suspended and the Continent remained \"at sixes and sevens.\" This condition of stalemate was protracted for almost two years, through 1963 and 1964, by exten- sive governmental changes and important national elections. In February 1963, the Conservative government of Prime Minister Diefenbaker of Canada was overthrown on a no-confidence vote based on charges that he had failed in vigor in supplying warheads for Canada's section of the North American defense system. He was replaced by a Liberal govern- ment headed by Lester B. Pearson. In the same month, in England the death of the Labour Party leader Gaitskell brought to the head of that opposition group a relatively unknown Left-wing intellectual and former university instructor, Harold Wilson, who had often supported Aneurin Bevan against Gaitskell's more moderate views. In June of 1963 the whole movement for Christian religious reunion and reform of the Catholic Church was suspended by the death of the very popular Pope John XXIII and installation of his successor as Pope Paul VII. In October one of the semipermanent fixtures of the European postwar political scene disap- peared when the eighty-seven-year-old Chancellor Konrad Adenauer resigned after a fourteen-year term; he was replaced in the chancellorship by Economic Minister Ludwig Erhard, who was widely regarded as the chief architect of Germany's spectacular economic recovery. Three days after Adenauer's resignation, Harold Macmillan, on grounds of ill health, resigned as prime minister and was able to impose on his party as his suc- cessor the ex-Earl of Home, renamed Sir Alec Douglas-Home. Thus the"},{"pageNumber":1324,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IX PERSPECTIVE  1309  British General Election of October 1964 was fought with new leaders on both sides. A few weeks after the shift of government in London, a more sig- nificant change of government took place in Rome as part of a long-term shift to the Left in the Italian political balance. Essentially the dominant Christian-Democratic group broke free, to some extent, from its reac- tionary Right wing and from the need to seek support on the Right by detaching the Left-wing Socialists from their long and uncomfortable alliance with the Communists by bringing this group into the govern- ment and leaving the Communists almost completely isolated on the Left. Aldo Aloro, political secretary of the Christian Democratic Party, be- came premier of the new arrangement in December 1963, with Pietro Nenni, of the Left-wing Socialists, as deputy premier. In theory the coali- tion rested on an agreement to seek to extend the benefits of the Italian prosperity boom to the less affluent workers' groups who had been rela- tively neglected in the hysterical pursuit of profits by more affluent entre- preneurs under the preceding governments. The Italian Cabinet shift was still in process when President Kennedy was assassinated by an unstable political fanatic in Dallas, Texas, on No- vember 22, 1963. This, in view of the power and influence of the Amer- ican Presidency, was the most significant governmental change for many years. After an unprecedented display of worldwide mourning, the new President, Lyndon B. Johnson, of Texas, took control of the American Presidency's global responsibilities and national obligations with only eleven months in which to establish his position as a candidate in the presidential election of 1964. As a consequence of these changes, the removal from office of Khru- shchev in October 1964, and the death that year of Jawaharlal Nehru, who had been prime minister of India from the achievement of independence in 1947, the governments of all major countries except France and Red China underwent significant shifts of personnel in a period of about fifteen months. This gave rise to a \"pause\" in world history for almost all of 1963-1964, during which each country placed increased emphasis on its domestic problems, especially on the demands of its citizens for increased prosperity, civil rights, and social security. Since the same tendency became evident also in France and Red China where the previ- ous leaders continued in power, the last two years covered by this book W'ere years of hesitation, decreased world tension, and confused plans for future courses."},{"pageNumber":1325,"pageContent":"13 io TRAGEDY AND HOPE Conclusion Tragedv and Hope? The tragedy of the period covered by this book is obvious, but the hope may seem dubious to many. Only the passage of time will show if the hope I seem to see in the future is actually there or is the result of misobservation and self-deception. The historian has difficultv distinguishing the features of the present, and generallv prefers to restrict his studies to the past, where the ev- idence is more freely available and where perspective helps him to in- terpret the evidence. Thus the historian speaks with decreasing assurance about the nature and significance of events as they approach his own day. The time covered bv this book seems to this historian to fall into three periods: the nineteenth century from about 1814 to about 1895; the twentieth century, which did not begin until after World War II, per- haps as late as 1950; and a long period of transition from 1895 to 1950. The nature of our experiences in the first two of these periods is clear enough, while the character of the third, in which we have been for only half a generation, is much less clear. A few things do seem evident, notably that the twentieth century now forming is utterly different from the nineteenth century and that the age of transition between the two was one of the most awful periods in all human history. Some, looking back on the nineteenth century across the horrors of the age of transition, may regard it with nostalgia or even envy. But the nineteenth century was, however hopeful in its general processes, a period of materialism, selfishness, false values, hypocrisy, and secret vices. It was the working of these underlying evils that eventually destroyed the century's hopeful qualities and emerged in all their naked- ness to become dominant in 1914. Nothing is more revealing of the na- ture of the nineteenth century than the misguided complacency and optimism of 1913 and early 1914 and the misconceptions with which the world's leaders went to war in August of 1914. The events of the following thirty years, from 1914 to 1945, showed the real nature of the preceding generation, its ignorance, complacency, and false values. Two terrible wars sandwiching a world economic de- pression revealed man's real inability to control his life by the nineteenth century's techniques of laissez faire, materialism, competition, selfishness, nationalism, violence, and imperialism. These characteristics of late nine- teenth-century life culminated in World War II in which more tha 11 50 million persons, 23 million of them in uniform, the rest civilians, were killed, most of them by horrible deaths."},{"pageNumber":1326,"pageContent":"THE FUTURE IN PERSPECTIVE  I 3 I I The hope of the twentieth century rests on its recognition that war and depression are man-made, and needless. They can be avoided in the future by turning from the nineteenth-century characteristics just men- tioned and sjoing back to other characteristics that our Western society has always regarded as virtues: generosity, compassion, cooperation, ra- tionality, and foresight, and finding an increased role in human life for love, spirituality, charity, and self-discipline. We now know fairly well how to control the increase in population, how to produce wealth and reduce poverty or disease; we may, in the near future, know how to post- pone senility and death; it certainly should be clear to those who have their eyes open that violence, extermination, and despotism do not solve problems for anvone and that victory and conquest are delusions as long as they are merely physical and materialistic. Some things we clearly do not yet know, including the most important of all, which is how to bring up children to form them into mature, responsible adults, but on the whole we do know now, as we have already shown, that we can avoid continuing the horrors of 1914-1945, and on that basis alone we may be optimistic over our ability to go back to the tradition of our Western society and to resume its development along its old patterns of Inclusive Diversity."},{"pageNumber":1328,"pageContent":"Index Aaland Islands, 678 Abdul Hamid II, 124 Abdullah, king of Transjordan, 248 Abelson, P.
