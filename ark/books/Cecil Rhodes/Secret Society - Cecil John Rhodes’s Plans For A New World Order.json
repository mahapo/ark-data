UnlikeCharles Darwin or William Ewart Gladstone – giants who in their own differentways set in motion the dynamism of the twentieth century – Rhodes has steadilydiminished in reputation as moral values have changed and his careless, perhapsunconscious and certainly in his own world entirely conventional racialprejudices have become more repugnant. None of this can lessen Rhodes’sachievement. Mining entrepreneur, political leader and visionary, he perceivedthe transformative potential of the diamond mines and gold mines of SouthAfrica, as well as the undeveloped grasslands of its distant central Africanhorizon – what would become, and then cease to be, Rhodesia. Though it was onlyafter his time that the disparate settler communities of the southern extremityof the continent would merge into the Union of South Africa, his vision made itthe powerhouse of modern Africa, the generator of the wealth which would attractmigrants of all races, from other parts of Africa, from India, and from Europe.The social disruption and the injustices which followed were not his doing,though they may have been the inevitable consequences of his vision. In anycase, he has been made to take the blame for them.However, the vision of Cecil Rhodes transcended even this. His own version ofthe civilising mission of the white races involved a future federation of theEnglish-speaking peoples, starting with the British Empire and its dominions,but eventually, he hoped, reincorporating the United States. Germany wouldperhaps be an honorary member. The ‘Anglosphere’, in modern parlance, combiningphysical strength with moral leadership, would guide the rest of the world inthe march of progress and civilisation.Rhodes was a practical man as well as a visionary, and at quite an early stageof his career he gathered round him a group of close friends who shared hisenthusiasm, and who were to be entrusted after his death with the funds to takehis plan further. The first step was the establishment of the Rhodes Trust andthe recruitment of the first Oxford Rhodes Scholars, who, he believed, would bean Empire-wide fraternity and the future leaders of the English-speakingpeoples. The Rhodes Trust is with us still, and Rhodes Scholars havedistinguished themselves throughout and beyond the Anglosphere. The long shadowof Rhodes’s coterie, transformed into Milner’s Kindergarten and other avatars ofthe founder’s spirit, lies, arguably, over the whole twentieth century.In this book, Robin Brown traces the emergence of the Rhodes circle,interweaving it with his own experiences of travelling through Africa andgrowing up in Rhodesia. He has put together a very diverse and widely scatteredbody of evidence, from which Rhodes himself appears as a much quirkier and morecontradictory figure than either his admirers or his detractors have allowed. Inthe following pages, with a deep knowledge of the many landscapes of southernAfrica and a profound and sympathetic understanding of its various peoples, hehas been able to put Rhodes’s turbulent life and persistent vision into arealistic context, and, further, to trace his surprisingly far-reaching legacythrough the twentieth century into our own time. Not every reader, I suspect,will agree with all his inferences on the long reach of the Secret Society; somewill doubt its coherence and its sense of identity; there is room for more thanone view. But every reader who persists will find here a fascinating story and astimulating argument which raises important questions, not only about the pasttwo centuries but about the present time.JEREMY CATTOFORMER RHODES FELLOW AND TUTOR IN MODERN HISTORY, ORIEL COLLEGE, OXFORD"},{"pageContent":"Prelude‘There came a sudden conjunction of two meteors, perhaps in the little hut thatGordon had been allocated under the shadow of the northern mountains of what,much later, was to become Lesotho. Or, to give a romantic interpretation to thisencounter: Rhodes and Gordon, lonely men of misogynist impulse, both being“absorbed in [their] gigantic dreams,” were delighted to find each other …Rhodes and Gordon went on long walks together during what must have been aperiod of no more than a week … In 1881 Gordon wrote a letter to a young memberof Parliament proposing a kind of secret community of men for the betterment ofsociety … a group of ombudsmen in Britain modeled on the so-called College ofCensors in China.’– Robert I. Rotberg, The Founder: Cecil Rhodes and the Pursuit of Power‘On the 19th September, 1877, this youth of 24 wrote his Last Will and TestamentTo and for the Establishment, Promotion and Development of, a Secret Society,the true aim and object whereof shall be the extension of British rulethroughout the world. Much later in life Rhodes remarked to me that he had neverdeviated from the policy he then laid down in that shanty on the DiamondFields.’– Sir Lewis Michell, The Life and Times of the Right Honourable Cecil JohnRhodes 1853–1902, Vol. 1* * *The ‘conjunction’ of these two ‘meteors’ – the ‘Colossus’ of Africa, Cecil JohnRhodes, and Charles George Gordon, also known as ‘Chinese Gordon’ of Khartoum –heralded a new era: it not only changed the way Britain was governed, but alsohow it fought its wars and ruled its Empire and Commonwealth over the nextcentury.Together, Rhodes and Gordon planned to establish a secret society which would beruled according to pseudo-Jesuit disciplines. In this way, the seeds Gordon hadplanted with a ‘young member of Parliament’ named Reginald Baliol Brett tookroot. For years, Gordon had corresponded with this courtier and royal whisperer,exchanging views about the Empire.After discussions with Brett in London in 1891, Rhodes paid Brett’s friend,newspaper magnate W.T. Stead, a huge advance to help set up the Secret Society.In time, W.T. Stead became Rhodes’s trustee, administering his vast diamond andgold fortune. He was assisted in this task by the former prime minister LordRosebery and the banker Nathan Rothschild.In 1885, Gordon was slain by the Mahdi’s forces after being besieged inKhartoum. Seven years later, in 1902, Rhodes went to his lonely grave in theremote hills of a country the size of France which he had named ‘Rhodesia’. Bythen, however, he had entrusted the stewardship of the Secret Society’s affairsto a former colleague of Stead’s named Alfred Milner, who was a politicalproconsul in South Africa. As Lord Milner, he soon held a seat on the Queen’sPrivy Council and later served as Britain’s minister of war, eventuallydeveloping the Secret Society into a global political network.Reginald Brett, who was by this time bonded to Milner, became the conduit of theSecret Society to the French Intelligence Service during the Great War. He wasalso Milner’s secret agent to the British commander-in-chief, General Haig,while continuing his clandestine role as royal whisperer, first to Edward VIIand then to George V. Fearing that Britain was about to lose the war, Brettwrote secretly from France, ‘I feel like Nelson at Trafalgar,’ and when hedemanded, ‘Send me Milner, Milner, Milner!’, Milner came.Through Milner’s agency, the Secret Society built a power base at the very heartof the British government. So influential had the Society become that it wouldeventually write the terms that ended the Great War, help to establish theuneasy peace that followed, and even make attempts at appeasement with Hitlerduring the Second World War.This Secret Society gradually evolved, establishing the Royal Institute ofInternational Affairs (RIIA) as well as similar political instruments incountries around the world. The RIIA, known today as Chatham House, is widelyrecognised as the most influential global political think tank of our times."},{"pageContent":"PART ONERHODES"},{"pageContent":"1The Hell HoleStretching as far as the eye could see was a view to rival Dante’s descriptionof hell. Into an enormous pit, hundreds of sweating diggers, black and white,climbed like an endless chain of ants down a rickety web of rough-hewn ladderslinked to a cart track spiralling downwards. The abyss had once been a hill,Colesberg Kopje, but the diggers had long since carted the hill away, and thepit into which the English boy, aged just nineteen, now stared was hundreds offeet deep and a similar distance across. He should not have been here at all.Eighteen months previously, in 1870, Cecil John Rhodes had been sent to SouthAfrica after being diagnosed – somewhat dubiously – with a heart problem andearly signs of consumption (tuberculosis of the lungs). Ostensibly sent out forhealth reasons, it is probably closer to the truth to say he had been sent toAfrica by a concerned and loving family who, in the face of these grimforecasts, hoped the African sun might delay the inevitable. Certainly, hisfamily had been at a loss to know what to do with young Cecil. Tall, intelligentand good-looking, with a leonine head, Cecil John was, nevertheless, the uglyduckling in his otherwise very ordinary upper middle-class Victorian family.Rhodes’s father was the kindly curate of Bishop’s Stortford in rural Essex, andthe family was comfortably off. Though his father was rather distant, hismother, Louisa, was devoted to Cecil, and he was the favourite of her sevenliving sons (she had borne eleven children, nine sons and two daughters). Butbecause Cecil was ‘delicate’, his parents had arranged for him to be educatedprivately. Unlike his elder brothers who had attended Eton and Harrow, Cecil wasnot considered fit for public school, even though he had achieved scholarshipqualifications.Yet here was this delicate teenager, staring into the living hell of theKimberley mining camp, breathing dust-laden air into supposedly damaged lungs.Moreover, he was alone. Herbert, the brother he had been sent out to join on acotton farm, was off elephant-hunting. It seems incomprehensible that Rhodes’sparents condoned this situation, and, indeed, that an elder brother would haveled him here and then abandoned him. But this is merely the first of severalincongruities in Rhodes’s early life, for at the time he was already rathergrandly considering how he might change the world.Using the chaos of the pit as his model, young Rhodes stood contemplating how hemight reorganise this disarray of men of all colours and creeds, with theirdiffering degrees of affluence. Moreover, much of this seemingly delusionaldreaming would soon become reality – a reality that would persist well after hisdeath and secure him a place in history.In the late Victorian era, Cecil John Rhodes would have been regarded by themajority of his countrymen as a missionary with a benevolent vision. Rhodes mayeven have gained some missionary zeal from his upbringing in the manse. At thetime, he was often portrayed as a serious young man, usually staring into space.Even at this young age, he had read the works of some of the great politicalthinkers of the ancient world. But still, it is hard to see how this interestprogressed to a formula for the total reformation of the world ruled by a covertelite – a formula which, a few years hence, he would write down and attach tohis first will.Precisely when Rhodes first came up with these ideas has been the subject ofconsiderable debate. However, it is widely thought that they were triggered byearly attempts to reform the diggings (the miners had established their own‘republic’, in defiance of the Transvaal) and a belief that the yet-unnamedsprawl of tents and shacks might have a future beyond the ‘rush’. However, thereis also evidence that the seeds of his grand scheme were sown much earlier thanthat, in 1870, while seventeen-year-old Rhodes was voyaging to South Africa.Rhodes first went out to Africa to work on a cotton farm north-east of the portof Durban, where he was supposed to join his elder brother, Herbert. The farmwas extremely remote, with the nearest white neighbours twelve miles away. Soonafter Cecil’s arrival, Herbert abandoned him, heading towards the newlydiscovered diamond fields, with some hunting along the way. Young Rhodes struckup a friendship with Henry Caesar Hawkins, son of the resident magistrate of theUmkomaas Valley, who was farming on a distant estate. The two boys began to makeplans that were somewhat bizarre for lads destined to grub a living from cotton,especially since the crop failed over the next two years. They decided to returnto England and to enter Oxford University – and to do so without outsideassistance.The influence of Hawkins on Rhodes’s formative years has been considerablyunderrated.1 [part0037.html#ch1fn-1] He was Rhodes’s only close friend duringhis two years on the cotton farm, and their lonely evenings around campfiresunder the stars are likely to have stimulated wide-ranging conversations,including how to put the world to rights. He quit farming at about the same timeas Rhodes and also ended up in Kimberley. Hawkins was a founder member of the‘band of brothers’ and almost certainly a party to the thoughts and ideasexchanged, all of which led to the formation of Rhodes’s first Secret Society inSouth Africa.By today’s standards, Cecil Rhodes and Caesar Hawkins were two tough teenagers.They had survived the crash of the cotton market and were now toiling in theKimberley pit. Shrieks and screams of anguish rose from the depths as aninterminable line of diggers descended and ascended again, often on rottenladders, with some crashing down as the mud walls collapsed. And when rainflooded the lower levels, the pit became a quagmire as hand-dug walls sliddownwards, destroying wooden platforms and rudimentary paths where doomed mulespulled carts laden with soil.Today, with digging ceased, the Big Hole is a tranquil green lake. But whenRhodes first saw it, mayhem and drunkenness prevailed in a camp where more thanforty bars and brothels battled to keep up with growing numbers of customers. Itwas like nothing that Rhodes had encountered in his short life. ‘Life on thediamond fields was no easy one,’ Lewis Michell wryly observes in his Life ofRhodes. He goes on:Camp fever [typhus] was very prevalent; there were no amenities and theanxieties were manifold. Early in 1874 the reef fell in continuously both atColesberg Kopje and in de Beers. Thousands of tons of shale covered some of theclaims and the value of others fluctuated violently. At one time there wereterrible floods until hardly a brick house was left standing in either camp.In 1887 Anthony Trollope described Kimberley as ‘distasteful in the extreme’.The temperature was 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the shade, with flies so numerous‘one hardly dares to slaughter them by ordinary means lest their dead bodiesshould be noisome … [and] a dust cloud so thick that it would seem that thesolid surface of the earth has risen diluted into the air’.Many myths surround Rhodes’s health. Indeed, all the early biographies describea Rhodes plagued by heart attacks, bleeding from the lungs, with persistentpneumonia, and even atrial fibrillation caused by syphilis – which Rhodes, mostimplausibly, is rumoured to have contracted from Zulu maidens! Charles Rudd andLeander Starr Jameson also came to Africa on account of ‘bad chests’, but thetruth is that all three men lived very active lives, undertaking arduous safaristhrough difficult terrain that was infested with lethal insects carrying malariaand sleeping sickness. In fact, Rhodes was tough and fairly fit up to the age offorty, when years of heavy drinking, eating and smoking started to take theirtoll. He certainly got colds and flu in the Oxford winters and his health wasalways better in Africa, but as the years went by the stories of theseuniversity ailments – like the tale of the incipient consumption brought on by achill he had caught rowing while on the Isis – were woven into the fabric of themyth of a Rhodes knocking regularly on death’s door.Typical of these hagiographers, Lewis Michell, who was also Rhodes’s banker,claims that Rhodes consulted a specialist in London. ‘Not six months to live’was the alleged entry in the doctor’s casebook – though this casebook has neverbeen found. Michell elaborates, ‘This diagnosis was to some extent confirmed inJune by a local practitioner, who said that the patient must not think of everreturning to England.’This claim of a life-threatening medical crisis is significant since it isalmost universally suggested that, forever afterwards, Rhodes regarded himselfas having a bad heart and poor lungs and therefore lived his life at a hurriedpace, fulfilling goal after goal in what was indeed a very short space of time.There appears to be no evidence of any such conditions, however, and whileRhodes may have worried about his heart, he never adapted his life toaccommodate any weakness – quite the contrary, in fact. He frequently sailed toEngland and back, took arduous safaris with friends, family and the military,rode most days, survived the long siege and starvation of Kimberley at the turnof the century, and even invaded Mozambique on a river steamer. He mostcertainly did not pamper himself.* * *Down inside the ever-deepening hole, the sticky yellow mud gave up its prize –chips of a dull, semi-transparent crystalline carbon which, when polished andcut, were luminescent diamonds. Stones – some as large as 237 carats – were dugup on these claims until eventually the yellow clay gave way to the ‘blueground’ called kimberlite. Rhodes realised the kopje was just the tip of adiamond iceberg: pipes of diamonds descended thousands of feet into the earth,pipes that perhaps went down as far as it was possible to penetrate the earth’scrust. They were digging their way to enormous, untold, inconceivable wealth.They were digging their way to Hell, preached the fire-and-brimstone ministersof the Afrikaner kerk. The steaming abyss would surely draw them down, theseUitlanders who had stolen this land with its diamonds from the newly establishedBoer republic of the Transvaal, incorporating it into a pocket-state the Britishnamed Griqualand in 1871. This parched land had long been contested, but beforethe arrival of the Dutch Voortrekkers from the Cape, and the British annexation,the land was roamed by the nomadic San people, followed later by the warriortribes of the African diaspora.The curate’s son from Bishop’s Stortford envisioned himself as a top dog, anEnglishman, as he once put it, who had won the lottery of life. Filled with theconviction of the imperial ruling class, Cecil John Rhodes stared into the dustypit with an evangelical gleam in his eye, imagining how order might be imposedon this rampant disorder, and how one day these sweating hordes might be part ofan Empire federation with seats in an English Parliament that dominated theworld.Domination was the key. Strength ensured peace, as history showed. Only one raceon earth was sufficiently civilised to administer its nations in a benignmanner: the English. They alone had the knowledge and experience to run anempire upon which the sun would never set. And what better place to enact thattheory than here, in the free-for-all of southern Africa?Young Rhodes quickly recognised that Kimberley could provide the wealth neededto finance his dream. Here was his war chest, ready to be dug from the ground.Riches beyond the dreams of Croesus were produced daily from the depths of theearth, and though the risks were considerable, they would be rewarded.There was a difference between this delicate young man and the other miners –the brawny men to whom Rhodes found himself attracted: Rhodes dreamt not simplyof owning a share of the diamonds, but of owning the entire pit and its valuablecontents. He would do this by assembling a group of like-minded young men whomet in secret, disciplined by rules as uncompromising as those of the Society ofJesus.The first to join this band of brothers were Alfred Beit and Charles Rudd. Beit,a German Jew, dealt in raw diamonds. The Englishman Rudd dabbled in manyenterprises and was a devoted friend, and in years to come he would beinstrumental in buying Rhodes an enormous piece of Africa as his privatefiefdom. Both Beit and Rudd died with fortunes even larger than that of Rhodes.Beit left a large part of his fortune to support Rhodes’s Secret Society, whichsoon became a hydra of many different aims and names. The fourth member of theSociety was a youthful doctor, Leander Starr Jameson, who joined this innercircle and would remain Rhodes’s intimate friend until his death.One of the first ventures undertaken by Rudd and Rhodes was ice-cream making –in the heat of Kimberley, this was hugely successful, and the two young meninvested their ice-cream profits in mining machinery. They used this pumpingequipment to salvage claims from the waterlogged pit, many of which they endedup buying. It was a start, and there would soon be no stopping these young men.But this is far more than a story of ice-cream and pumping equipment. At thetender age of nineteen, Rhodes was in the early stages of accumulating thelargest personal fortune on earth, which he would use to restructure globalpolitics.The telling of the story of Cecil John Rhodes has, of course, been influenced byshifting attitudes towards colonialism and imperialism. Immediately after hisdeath there were a series of sycophantic eulogies in which Rhodes was portrayedin god-like terms – a ‘great and brooding spirit’.2 [part0037.html#ch1fn-2] Butas the twentieth century progressed, imperialism became a dirty word and itsoffspring, colonialism, was reviled. This shift spawned a new generation ofbooks and films that vilified Rhodes.3 [part0037.html#ch1fn-3] Rhodes was,however, neither a ‘Colossus’ nor a ‘White Devil’. The maligned ‘GrandImperialist’ paradoxically championed the rights of black people and was, formost of his political career, a friend to the Boers. Asked in 1899 by arepresentative of the coloured community to define his position on voters,Rhodes’s reply was: ‘My Motto is – equal rights for every civilised man south ofthe Zambesi’ – whether white or black, as long as he was basically literate,owned some property, and was ‘not a loafer’.Significantly, Rhodes applied these conditions to family beneficiaries in hiswill: ‘I object to an expectant heir developing into what I call a “loafer”.’ Hemade inheritance conditional: no one could be an heir ‘unless they have been forat least ten consecutive years engaged in some profession or business’ (fromthis he excluded a career in the military). Rhodes seemed genuinely not to carefor money per se, as the following letter about him to Michell attests:Out of the mess tent came a tall fair boy, blue eyed and with somewhat aquilinefeatures, wearing flannels of the school playing field somewhat shrunken withstrenuous rather than effectual washing, that still left the colour of the redveld dust – a harmony in a prevailing scheme. This was my first impression ofCecil John Rhodes. We brought our tents and set them next to his, I was destinedin the following year to see much of him. Many young men would have been contentto float on the easy tide of good fortune, but it was not so with Cecil Rhodes …he had made up his mind to go to University. Then in an abrupt way he said ‘Idare say you think I am keen about money: I assure you I would not care if Ilost all I have tomorrow, it’s the game I like.’What ‘game’ was this? All the early hagiographies either ignored the SecretSociety altogether, or passed it over as a youthful fantasy. While laterbiographies give it brief mention, it is presented merely as evidence of latentmegalomania. Research reveals, however, that the Society was not simply thedream of a callow though ambitious youth, but rather that it dictated Rhodes’severy waking moment, so that it continued beyond the grave.The Secret Society has perhaps been passed over because it is not the subjectmatter of conventional biography. It has instead been categorised as conspiracytheory, the stuff of whodunits, involving diamonds by the ton, vast hoards ofgold, political intrigue, presidents and prime ministers, plots involving theNazi axis, errant aristocrats and royals – and, of course, that particular‘secret society’ that is world banking. But it is clearly not a conspiracytheory: Rhodes documented everything. The codicil attached to his first willannouncing his intention to form a secret society to rule the world may be foundat Rhodes House in Oxford. In addition, he nominated beneficiaries to run theSociety and left them money to fund its activities. Finally, the Society stillexists, albeit in several different forms. Though far less secretive, some ofthese do still lack transparency, and some, as we shall see, are moreinfluential today than they were over a century ago.* * *My initial involvement in the subject of this book began with my good friend LinMehmel presenting me with a first edition of Sir Lewis Michell’s The Life andTimes of the Right Honourable Cecil John Rhodes as a birthday gift. As one ofRhodes’s bankers and an executor and trustee of his final will, Michell wrotewhat is the most eulogistic of the Rhodes biographies. However, what was ofparticular interest to me was Michell’s emphasis in the Introduction that he hadhad access to Rhodes’s private and official papers. I know of no otherbiographer who could make that claim. Indeed, many of Rhodes’s papers as well asthose of his intimates have been either lost or destroyed. And so, whileMichell’s text is turgid, the material on which it is based is unique,consisting substantially of primary sources.Then, on 6 March 2010, in response to my research request, I received a callfrom Alta Kriel, curator of Groote Schuur, the Cape Town house Rhodes hadbequeathed to the nation. I explained that I wished to expand on informationregarding the first will, which is quoted in full in Lewis Michell’s biography.Alta Kriel was, incidentally, the first of several Rhodes cognoscenti Iencountered who confessed to having scant knowledge of the Secret Society.Though she had allowed me access to the Rhodes library some years before when Iwas researching the enigmatic ‘lost’ stone cities of ancient Zimbabwe, thecurator explained that, since the deputy president of South Africa was inresidence, security concerns prohibited visitors on this occasion.I might well have put the whole subject aside there and then, but a week or solater I had another call from the curator explaining that, since heritageconsiderations precluded the installation of bulletproof glass, the deputypresident had moved out, and the house was no longer occupied. She invited me toclimb quickly through this window of opportunity – and in I went.Groote Schuur sits on a magnificent site on the lower reaches of Table Mountain,its beautiful gardens carefully tended ever since the time of Rhodes. Rebuilt bySir Herbert Baker after a disastrous fire in 1896, it reflects the centuries-oldCape Dutch tradition with its white gables, teak windows and wide airy verandathat looks up at a mountain famous for its tablecloth of cloud.Inside, Groote Schuur is a dark jumble of Victorian furniture, much of itcommissioned by Baker from local craftsmen using exquisite colonial hardwoods.Temperatures are controlled in the summer by shutters and thick curtains, andthe effect is rather gloomy. As Rhodes had no domestic life to speak of, hiscarefully tended collection of furniture and objects is distinctly eclectic.Cannons from old Zimbabwe forts guard the doors, and mythical soapstone birdsfrom the same area decorate the main staircase. A vast bath carved from a singlepiece of Paarl granite dominates the bathroom, and a number of rather strangegifts from visiting dignitaries are on display.The only rooms that look at all lived-in are a small library and an even smallerstudy – rooms that, for me, house the real treasures of Groote Schuur. During myvisit, the curator surprised me by pointing to Rhodes’s desk, upon which lay abook bound in bright red Moroccan leather. Next to it lay a pair of cottongloves. The book Alta Kriel had prepared for me was, she explained, the rarestbook in a unique collection assembled by Rhodes himself. It was almost as goodas having a private interview with Cecil John Rhodes – a meeting where, I hoped,he would explain his philosophy of life. The leather-bound volume was not a bookin the usual sense, but a bundle of typed pages expensively bound and gilt-edged– one of 480 bound typescripts Rhodes had made in his lifetime.* * *As a student, Rhodes made slow progress at Oxford. Much of his time was taken upat Kimberley where, in that awful hole, he was laying the foundations of one ofthe greatest personal fortunes of his time, helping to build the De Beers MiningCompany, which eventually augmented this vast diamond wealth with Witwatersrandgold. Inevitably, Rhodes neglected the classical languages required by Oxford,but he solved the problem by having English translations made of all the bookshe needed to study. This squaring of problems and people would become Rhodes’strademark.Hatchards Publishers in London were hired to set up a group of universitygraduates to translate a large number of the classics, and to type out a specialcopy for Rhodes himself. He eventually terminated the project, but only when hisshelves were groaning with the weight of 500 or more tomes. Why his collectionof manuscripts, or rather typescripts, has never been properly studied orrecognised remains a mystery. It may be that Rhodes was embarrassed by his lackof a classical education and so he hid them in the library at Groote Schuur.Most importantly, they represent a unique guide to the man who has beendescribed as the greatest imperialist in British colonial history.One volume in particular has, according to Alta Kriel, never really beenexamined before: a typed transcript of The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius,translated by Hatchards from a French codex. Rhodes was famous for never beingwithout a copy of Marcus Aurelius, though it is unlikely that the well-thumbededition he carried around with him would have been this particular copy, despiteits being the only volume in the entire collection that was annotated by Rhodes.Several passages have lines drawn in the margin, while other passages areheavily underlined, and some are even corrected. So, in a sense, perusing thisbook was almost as good as being in conversation with Rhodes himself. Thethoughts and sayings of Marcus Aurelius were greatly significant to Rhodes, andthe book was in a sense his bible. The annotations themselves are a kind ofsignature, a key to Rhodes’s philosophy of life.As I paged through the typescript, I was struck by one paragraph in particular:three underlined lines of text were marked with two thick parallel pencil linesdown either side of the margin. As I read, the hairs stood up on the back of myneck. Again, it a was a revelation – not at all the kind of idea that one wouldhave credited to a man who has been so widely condemned for his racism and theoppression of the native peoples of Africa. I could clearly visualise Rhodesstanding there, reading aloud: ‘To Severus I owe my knowledge of Thrasea,Helvidius, Cato, Brutus, the conception of a free state in which the naturalequality of the citizens is the ruling power, and the idea of royalty, whichsets before all duties respect for the liberty of a subject.’"},{"pageContent":"2Rhodes’s SecretsI have a vision of nineteen-year-old Cecil Rhodes bumping along the Great NorthRoad – just as I did when, many years ago, I travelled overland with my parentsfrom England to Africa. The main difference would have been the mode oftransport: I’d travelled in a war-surplus Dodge Desert Command Car while Rhodestrundled along in a horse-drawn Cape cart. His, I suspect, was the morecomfortable ride.But there would have been another difference. In my school satchel I had a bookabout a dog called Jock, written by one of Rhodes’s greatest admirers, Sir PercyFitzPatrick. Rhodes on the other hand carried his copy of Marcus Aurelius’sMeditations, similar to the typescript that Alta Kriel, wearing white gloves,had carefully laid out for me on Rhodes’s desk at Groote Schuur.On first hearing of his obsession with Marcus Aurelius, I regarded it as nothingmore than spin, the attempt of earlier biographers to polish Rhodes’s image. Notnearly as educated as his peers, over the nine-year period Rhodes was at Oxfordhe mostly indulged himself at influential clubs like the Bullingdon.Immortalised by Evelyn Waugh in Brideshead Revisited, the Bullingdon wasfrequented by aristocrats and wealthy men, many of whom were homosexual. InRhodes’s time, Oscar Wilde was a member of the club.While Rhodes may have been under-educated, unintelligent he was not. His love ofclassical literature has been widely documented, and when at Groote Schuur I sawhis remarkable private collection of typescripts gleaming from behind theircovers of red morocco, I realised that they might offer a unique insight intothe man. This strange collection had in fact resulted from his interest inEdward Gibbon’s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, which he is reported tohave read at least twice. It was in 1893, when, accompanied by Rochfort Maguire,Rhodes had marched into Hatchards in London and asked the publishers to set up ateam of scholars to translate all the classics Gibbon had consulted for Declineand Fall.A Hatchards executive, Arthur Humphreys, put together a team of ‘ex-dons ofOxbridge colleges who had drifted into matrimony’ and a team of academics, ‘men,matrons and maids’, overseen by a ‘parson pedagogue’, which eventually numberedthirty. There was another team to do the typing (though none of the volumes everwent into print), prepare indexes and bind the books. On Rhodes’s instruction,Humphreys extracted an oath of secrecy from each person involved. They were toldthe work was being done for a ‘millionaire who does not wish his name toappear’. As it turned out, the parson in charge allowed the project to run wildover the next five years. Not only were there translations of familiar classicslike the Meditations, but the more obscure works of Martial, Menander, DioCassius, Sabine and Terence also appeared. Hatchards themselves, presumably onRhodes’s orders, added an additional series of eighteen biographies of Romanemperors plus studies of the wives of the twelve Caesars, as well as Islamicclassics, works of foreign geographers and a book of Erotic Epigrams. By thetime Rhodes called a halt to this deluge in 1898 he had spent some £8,000 on theproject (close to a million pounds today), and was receiving translated workssuch as a set on the Fathers of the Church, which he had either forgotten aboutor not actually ordered.A voracious reader, Rhodes apparently read most of these works. He would sitafter dinner on the stoep at Groote Schuur ‘talking by the hour about ancientRome and its warrior emperors’.1 [part0037.html#ch2fn-1] In planning trips toEngland, his private secretary Currey recalls being asked how many days theywould be at sea, and when he answered ‘twenty’, Rhodes would go to a bookshopand randomly order forty books – ‘one for the morning and one for theafternoon’.2 [part0037.html#ch2fn-2] Another secretary, Jourdan, brought fiftybooks for a similar trip, commenting: ‘He liked dipping into one and thenputting it down until he found a volume that interested him.’ But theMeditations never left his side, whether the field copy or the annotated librarycopy at Groote Schuur. It is possible that the last person to study this librarycopy – pristine apart from the pencil marks – was Rhodes himself.3[part0037.html#ch2fn-3]One of Rhodes’s closest friends was the doctor turned treasure-hunter Dr HansSauer, who had been a partner in Rhodes’s secret acquisition of cheap farmlandin the Transvaal. The land was subsequently mined as the Johannesburg Rand.Until recently this was the richest gold deposit in the world, providing Rhodeswith a source for increasing his already-large second fortune.When Groote Schuur was destroyed by fire in 1896, Cecilia Sauer, wife of Hans,sent Rhodes another copy of the Meditations. She had assumed his own preciouscopy was destroyed by the flames, but a few months later, upon meeting her inLondon, Rhodes returned her gift. ‘I don’t want it – you see my own copy neverleaves me,’ Rhodes told her. ‘But I want you to know that I appreciate the kindthought very much – yes! Very much.’ An appreciative Rhodes went on to say thathe wished to do something for her that ‘he had never done for anyone else onearth’, and drew from his pocket his own copy of Meditations, inviting her totake it home – but for three days only. ‘It is my guide in life,’ Cecilia Sauerrecalls Rhodes telling her. ‘It is my most prized possession. Don’t lose it.There are many people who would give a great deal to see it. Don’t lend it toanyone – don’t let anyone see it.’This story might be regarded as apocryphal were it not for its postscript. Sointrigued were the Sauers by the notion of Rhodes marking ‘passages that shouldrule conduct’ that they marked these same passages in their own copy, which wasretrieved years later, after the end of World War II, from a house they hadowned in France.The typescript contains an annotated list of principles that guided Rhodes’slife. According to Robert Rotberg (a Rhodes Scholar himself, and probably thebest of Rhodes’s biographers), the annotations in Sauer’s copy indicate apreoccupation with certain ideas, and one of these was his premature death:More than a quarter of the underlined assertions deal with death. With death asan aspect of life. The end may come at any time, life-spans are short andwealth, fame and grandeur are extinguished with an individual’s death. It makessense to live life as if death were imminent and, fatalistically, to acceptwhatever comes as the playing out of the natural order.However, this concern with death too neatly dovetails with the view that Rhodesshared his doctor’s prognosis, i.e. that he would die at an early age while inAfrica. For while it is true that most Victorians held views on death notdissimilar to those outlined above, it should be borne in mind that the averagemale life expectancy was barely forty years at the time. Despite the hazards ofhis lifestyle, Rhodes lived until the age of forty-nine – almost a decade longerthan average. Rhodes’s ‘tragic early death’ is a cornerstone of the Rhodes myth.Other elements of the myth are Rhodes’s oratory and his imposing physique. Whilehe was six feet tall, his voice was in fact reedy and peculiarly high-pitched,and his oratory was mediocre. The Cape Town Club has his death mask hanging inits hall, revealing that his head was neither large nor striking, and notparticularly ‘leonine’.Myths of course are quite commonly shaped to the image ‘great men’ leave behindthem – ghostly shrouds that conceal faults and failings, allowing only triumphsand achievements to shine through. Also, as biographers like Rotberg suggest,the myths are concerned not so much with the reality of Rhodes (young, fit androbust) but with his imaginings: ‘fearful that death might cut me off beforetime’.The annotations in the field copy of Meditations are, as Rotberg suggests,instructive, revealing ‘Rhodes’ desire that intellect should prevail overemotions to which he was so susceptible’, and his belief that ‘making moraljudgements was hazardous unless one understood the other person’s reasoningabout right and wrong’, and that ‘Evil hurts the evil-doer more than thevictim.’Rhodes did not merely contemplate the aphorisms in Meditations, he was driven bythem: they offered guidance to a life that was now evolving at a rapid pace. Hehad arrived in South Africa penniless and unknown, and within five years he wasa millionaire with a fortune growing exponentially, with no end in sight. Withinanother five years he was prime minister of the Cape, an English privycouncillor – and about to acquire a fiefdom a quarter the size of Europe.As his fortune and political influence grew, as the arid earth and the highsavannah produced a cornucopia of diamonds and gold beyond imagining, Rhodesbegan to feel he had been put on this earth for some greater purpose. He wouldexpand the English-speaking sphere of influence until it was so powerful that nonation would dare oppose it, and war would be a thing of the past: ‘Thefoundation of so great a power as to hereafter render wars impossible andpromote the best interest of humanity.’ The best way to achieve this was bymeans of a secret society.Rhodes’s grand designs were dependent on other values outlined in theMeditations, primarily tenacity and hard work. As Rotberg points out, theseideasaffirm the need to do what was serious, not frivolous, and what was right evenif it was unpopular. Actions, according to Marcus Aurelius, should primarily befor the good of others or society. Just acts were their own reward … success inlife involved working with others and being prepared to alter one’s innerconvictions if more powerful arguments were offered by one’s friends orassociates.The Groote Schuur translation of Marcus Aurelius contains underlined passageswhich are more reflective than those in the field copy, revealing a Rhodes whowas beginning to be aware that his days might be numbered. The passage below hadheavy pencil marks in the margins, with each line scored deeply into the paper.Significantly, Rhodes was by this time already heading an active secret societyin South Africa: ‘The power of ideas is marvellous: but the ideas are ourselvesand their power is our own. Nothing whatever can make us contrary to our ideas;and even when we seem to be following foreign council we are only obeying theauthority within us.’The ‘authority within’ Rhodes was an almost evangelical belief in the Empire andimperialism. Today, of course, the majority of the world’s population regardBritish imperialism as anathema, a political aberration that resulted in thesubjugation and oppression of foreign, mostly coloured, people by white people.However, imperialism is fraught with contradictions, with Rhodes himself a primeexample. He was of the era of British reformers who caused slavery to beoutlawed, and Rhodes himself would undoubtedly have been appalled by thesuggestion that imperialists of his ilk promoted or fostered slavery.While Rhodes indisputably had his blind spots, for most of his political careerhe displayed what were then liberal attitudes towards blacks and Boers (thoughhe far preferred the Dutch of the Cape to the Boers in the hinterlandrepublics). It is, moreover, a matter of record that the Matabele,4[part0037.html#ch2fn-4] whose defeat Rhodes helped bring about with theassistance of Jameson’s army, gathered in numbers at his Matopos funeral. Led byindunas, they roared the royal salute ‘Bayethe!’ as Rhodes was lowered into histomb on the remote Matabeleland hillside. Numerous African nationalists havecontended that this event was orchestrated, but my own experience of living andworking among the fiercely independent Matabele people suggests otherwise. Formany years I ran the television station in Bulawayo, and I doubt that, as asub-tribe of the Zulu, the Matabele would ever have submitted to any kind of‘orchestration’, especially in such large numbers.Of course, like most Victorians, Rhodes regarded Africans as ‘barbarous’.5[part0037.html#ch2fn-5] This was the term imperialists used to describe peoplewho, in their view, routinely raided and enslaved their neighbours – as fiercetribes like the Zulu frequently did at the time. It was, moreover, the duty ofany imperialist worth his salt to put an end to such practices. Essentially,imperialists like Rhodes believed – as did the Zulus – that anyone who couldstand their ground was entitled to keep it.6 [part0037.html#ch2fn-6] This hadbeen the prime justification for the global Secret Society that Rhodes outlinedin the codicil to his first will – a society that would bring about a new worldorder via an imperial federation of nations so powerful as to prevent all futurewars.One particular group of ‘barbarians’ occupies a significant place in this story:the Matabele (they have always held a special place in my own heart,particularly since a couple of fierce young Matabele women – well, theyfrightened me! – brought up two of my daughters). A breakaway faction of theZulu empire, the Matabele had ferociously fought their way up to the LimpopoRiver, established a kingdom, and set up a vassal state, Mashonaland, to thenorth. The Matabele also occupied a special – if less loving – place in CecilRhodes’s heart, the reason being that their mighty regiments stood between himand a ‘lost city’ in Mashonaland which, he had been told, was surrounded by‘King Solomon’s mines’.Before his excursion to Matabeleland, Rhodes had several apprenticeships toserve: cotton farmer (quickly abandoned), diamond digging (hugely successful),university student (where he played the fool), all before becoming a billionaireand a powerful politician. The practice of imperialism also had to be studied,and Rhodes learnt from its most successful practitioners, as the typescripts atGroote Schuur reveal. Many of his favourite books were translations describingthe world’s greatest conquerors, several of whom had made the earliest Europeanconquests of Africa. The mix included the works of philosophers and moralists,which strengthened his belief that Englishmen had a divine right and mission tocontrol Africa, and indeed the world. He passed this conviction on to hissuccessors, and almost half a century later Julian Amery, the son of LeopoldAmery, a leading figure in the Secret Society, was quoted as saying:He [Leopold Amery] believed that British Imperialism was a civilizing mission towhich the British peoples could dedicate themselves: one from which they wouldderive a sense of purpose and a source of pride. This concept of Empire was muchmore than a political programme. It was an ideology that constituted a coherentsystem of thought to which every issue, political, economic, social, cultural,and even moral could be related. More than that, it was a faith. This faithwould sustain him throughout his entire life.The deeper I delved into the Groote Schuur typescripts, the more of an enigmaRhodes became. Imperialism was God’s work, he believed, and now he had beenblessed with the gift of the Kimberley diamonds to finance his role in thiswork.It is not difficult to understand why Rhodes thought like this. The tiny islandof England had by this time created the largest empire on earth, consisting ofover 25 per cent of the world’s population and area. It included India,Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Rhodesia north and south, HongKong, Gibraltar, several islands in the West Indies and various colonies on theAfrican coast. In 1750 the population of Britain was four million, and by the1850s when Rhodes was born it was twenty-one million. By 1900, Queen Victoriareigned over 410 million people. England had, moreover, established this vastempire against fierce competition, and it needed devoted imperialists likeRhodes, working at its frontiers, to protect and expand it. The scramble forAfrica had begun.Chancellor Otto von Bismarck took Rhodes’s expansionism so seriously that heappointed German agents in South Africa to keep a close eye on him. Bismarckhimself had turned ‘kolonialmensch’, annexing two chunks of Africa: German WestAfrica (now Namibia) and German East Africa (now Tanzania). These colonies couldeasily be linked via the two pro-German Boer republics, the Transvaal and theOrange Free State, blocking further British expansion to the north.France had been an imperial power in Africa before the English arrived. From itsNorth African colonies, France thrust towards central Africa, looking forcontrol of the Great Lakes region. But it was Portugal that had made theearliest start of all, in what is now Mozambique. Their colonial policy had atwist called ‘assimilado’, whereby settlers were encouraged (sometimes forced)to ‘assimilate’, making Africa their home, and to intermarry with Africans – anotion that was anathema to the English, and indeed the descendants of theDutch, as history would show.* * *Rhodes’s choice of burial site in Matabeleland is in the Matopos, themagnificent area where he negotiated the peace with the Matabele. The heavilyunderlined passage from Meditations perhaps hints at the reasons behind hischoice: ‘Sextus of Chaperonaea … showed me a model of kindliness, an example ofa family ruled by paternal affection, a man who understood the idea of life inconformity with Nature.’ The gravesite bears the simplest of inscriptions: HereLie the Remains of Cecil John Rhodes.Related to this are some underlined passages from Marcus Aurelius: ‘Can’t yousee I’m a philosopher?’ ‘I see,’ replied Herodes, ‘a beard and a cloak.’ Andagain, Sextus: ‘I can endure fatigue, have few wants, place my own hand to thework, do not meddle with the business of others and have given littleopportunity to the informers.’It is certainly true that Rhodes had ‘few wants’. His servants found itdifficult to get him to wear decent clothes, to eat proper meals or even todress for and attend theatrical performances. For recreation he rode a littleand read a lot. In his later years he enjoyed holding forth from the head of themassive dining table at Groote Schuur, where he often ate and drank to excess.The degree to which he gave ‘opportunity to the informers’ is questionable. Hewas certainly secretive – and, as we shall see, he held to the essentialprinciples of his Secret Society until he died, making complex arrangements forhis core principles to continue after his death. The term ‘workaholic’ had notbeen coined at the time, but it certainly applies to Rhodes. His last words areapocryphally reported as: ‘So little done, so much to do.’7[part0037.html#ch2fn-7]Rhodes kept a tiny tin-roofed seaside cottage in a village near Cape Town, wherehe spent much of his free time with male friends. He died in this cottage,tended lovingly by Leander Starr Jameson who – apart from the month he was inprison for leading the ill-fated Jameson Raid – had never left Rhodes’s side.* * *Rhodes’s much-debated misogyny8 [part0037.html#ch2fn-8] seems to chime with thefollowing heavily underlined paragraph in Marcus Aurelius: ‘We can draw on thegeneral rule that women, considered collectively, are far inferior to men, butconsidered individually are sometimes far their superior.’However, Rhodes had several female friends, among them Lady Grey, wife of theBritish administrator Earl Grey. She admired Rhodes, observing that without himpeace with the Matabele ‘would never have been accomplished for no other mancould secure as he can the confidence of both whites and the natives’. There wasa similar bond with Julia Maguire, wife of Rhodes’s good friend James RochfortMaguire, who was with Rhodes for the duration of the siege of Kimberley, andclaimed to have eaten every meal in his company. ‘I wished each meal to go onand on so fine and exhilarating was the talk.’Rhodes’s relationship with Olive Schreiner was more fraught, however. As willsoon become clear, the author of The Story of an African Farm seems to have hadmore than an intellectual interest in Rhodes. And this was not, apparently,unreciprocated.* * *Apart from the extraordinary Hatchard typescripts, and the annotated MarcusAurelius in particular, I had come across little else of real interest in theGroote Schuur library. Until, one morning, Alta Kriel approached me and said,‘There is also this.’The book she pointed to was William Winwood Reade’s The Martyrdom of Man,published in 1872. Her tone was decidedly disapproving, and I wondered whetherthis was because of Rhodes’s obsession with Reade, who occupied a prominentposition in Rhodes’s intellectual life. But she simply went on to say thatRhodes had allegedly told Princess Radziwill – whose story will later unfold –that ‘this was the book that made him’.Like many Victorians, Rhodes dabbled in the occult, in cabals, and whatVictorians called ‘the mysteries’. As a teenager on the failing cotton farm,Rhodes was among those who regarded The Martyrdom of Man as being quite asrevolutionary as Darwin’s The Origin of Species. Others shared this opinion,including George Orwell, who wrote: ‘Reade was an emancipated writer because heseems to speak as man to man to resolve history into an intelligible pattern inwhich there is no need for miracles.’ Some twenty years earlier, H.G. Wells hadcommended Reade’s book as ‘an extraordinarily inspiring presentation of humanhistory as one consistent process’. And similarly, Sherlock Holmes said to DrWatson: ‘Let me recommend this book – one of the most remarkable ever penned.’Interestingly, both H.G. Wells and Arthur Conan Doyle were acolytes of AlfredMilner, the British proconsul who ruled the Secret Society as Rhodes’s successorwhen it was established in England early in the twentieth century.The Martyrdom of Man is a collection of aphorisms, and in this it is reminiscentof Marcus Aurelius. The following are a representative sample: * If indeed there was a judgement day, it would be for man to appear at the bar not as criminal but as accuser. * It may safely be asserted that the art of war will soon be reduced to a simple question of expenditure and credit, and that the largest purse will be the strongest arm. * The essence of religion is inertia; the essence of science is change. It is the function of the one to preserve, it is the function of the other to improve.Such ideas would have been music to young Rhodes’s imperialist ears. He no doubtthrilled at the notion that ‘Trade is the great engine of progress, empire is anecessary condition of trade, egalitarianism and liberal national sympathies awaste of time.’ The latter two concepts are promoted by ‘[a] sickly school ofpoliticians who declare that all countries belong to their inhabitants and totake them is a crime’.Much of this is, of course, naive, and so today William Winwood Reade isvirtually unknown. Reade died young, and The Martyrdom of Man was his swansong;no venerable Scottish seer, he was simply a rich young man who, like Rhodes, hadbeen a student at Oxford, and had likewise taken himself off to Africa. Reade’soften juvenile philosophy, as well as his mildly revolutionary politicalbeliefs, fomented ideas in Rhodes which remained with him throughout his life.Reade died in 1875, aged thirty-six, while covering the Ashanti War for TheTimes.A year later, Rhodes enrolled at Oriel College (Reade had been at Magdalen), andit was in 1877 that he wrote his Confession of Faith, where he makes thefollowing assertion:Africa is still lying ready for us it is our duty to take it. It is our duty toseize every opportunity of acquiring more territory and we should keep this oneidea steadily before our eyes that more territory simply means more of theAnglo-Saxon race more of the best the most human, most honourable race the worldpossesses.Quite possibly, the copy of The Martyrdom of Man that Alta Kriel had held out tome that day at Groote Schuur was the very same one that inspired Rhodes also towrite the following: ‘Why should we not form a Secret Society with but oneobject: The furtherance of the British Empire and the bringing of the wholeuncivilised world under British Rule.’"},{"pageContent":"3The Empire’s ApprenticeWhen Rhodes, still only nineteen years old, abandoned the cotton field in Nataland arrived at Colesberg Kopje to join his brother Herbert in the even morerisky business of diamond prospecting, the Empire was hanging on in South Africaby its fingertips.Established Dutch-speaking families formed the political majority in the Britishcolonies of the Cape and Natal. A rebellious band of Boer farmers had trekkedaway from British rule in 1836, eventually setting up their own republics in thehinterland: the Orange Free State and the South African Republic.1[part0037.html#ch3fn-1] When the Boer War ended in 1902, the British annexedboth, calling them respectively the Orange River Colony and the Transvaal.Ownership of the diamond fields was hotly disputed by the Boers, but the stillunnamed area was rapidly becoming a digger colony in its own right. In August1866, when the first diamond pipes were found, 1,000 claims were marked out in amatter of days. By October the army of diggers had risen to 5,000, and byDecember the population reached 7,000 – by now greater than the adjoining Boerrepublics.Rhodes wrote to his mother, who was understandably worried about him,euphemistically describing Colesberg Kopje as a ‘small round hill surrounded bywhite tents’, effectively disguising the awfulness of the place. For by then, ofcourse, Colesberg Kopje was already a thing of the past. By December, just amonth after Rhodes arrived, there was already a hole seventy feet deep where thekopje had been.This pit would soon become the largest hole ever to be dug on the surface of theearth. Mined for almost half a century, the Kimberley ‘Big Hole’ finally closedin 1914, after an estimated 50,000 miners had dug a crater some forty-two acresacross. Wielding mainly picks and shovels, the men eventually excavated to adepth of 1,097 metres.Approaching the diggings, Rhodes would have gaped at a giant plume of yellowdust rising high into a cloudless sky, with below it a seething slum of dirtycanvas, packing-case shacks and mud-brick hovels. No incipient consumptive couldhave lasted a day here, and the pollution around the Big Hole surely puts torest any suggestion that Rhodes had chest problems. The following anonymousreport from the time is instructive:Our wagons at last entered the great beehive, and wended their way in and outamong the canvas shelters dotted promiscuously here, there and everywhere,creaking and groaning through deep sand and ruts or staggering over mightymounds of debris. The few wooden tenements scattered about at rare intervals hadbeen fashioned out of packing cases and the owners thereof considered themselvesthe aristocrats of Diggerdom.Tents became denser and more bewildering in its chaotic array. Water was thenvery scarce and the many unwashed faces that peeped out curiously as we passedseemed to match the colour of the many canvas abodes. Hordes of dogs andsemi-nude kaffirs were everywhere and handy Scotch carts drawn by teams of oxen,mules or horses were noisily bumping their way along labyrinthine roadways.Every conceivable cast and colour of the human race – the Kaffir, theEnglishman, the Hottentot, and the Dutchman, the Fingo and the German, theYankee and the Swede, the Frenchman and the Turk, the Norwegian, the Russian andthe Greek. In fact a smattering of people from every nation on the face of theearth – digging, sifting and sorting from morning until night, day after day,month after month until they have obtained a sufficiency.The secretary of state for the colonies, Lord Kimberley, decided that the farmVooruitzicht, where the first diamonds were found, was unpronounceable, and sothe place was called Kimberley.Ownership of this hell hole was, similarly, a matter of dispute. In 1871 aBritish Court of Arbitration dismissed the territorial claims of both Boerstates – the South African Republic and the Orange Free State – and declared theGriqua chief Nicolaas Waterboer owner of what was fast becoming the mostvaluable land in southern Africa.This was a deliberate and considered insult to the Boers, who not onlyconsidered the Griquas to be a race of bastards, but regarded Griqua women as adanger to Boer racial purity. It is no accident that the earliest ‘apartheid’laws were passed in the Boer republics, preventing sexual relationships betweenBoers and Griqua women. According to Rotberg, the Griquas werean ethnically-mixed people from much of the human material of early SouthAfrica: Boer frontiersmen; remnants of Koisan hunters; gatherers andpastoralists; escaped slaves from the Cape; free blacks from the same domain;and Africans somehow detached from their own communities. They were in a geneticsense the only true South Africans.Insult was added to Boer injury when, in that same year of 1871, the Cape Colonyannexed Griqualand West as a Crown Colony, dispatching three commissioners and astrong contingent of police to run Kimberley. Unbeknown to Cecil Rhodes, who wasjust approaching his twentieth birthday, these events would provide him with aunique apprenticeship. The new Crown Colony was given a seat in the CapeParliament, and five years later, Cecil Rhodes, by then a Fellow of OrielCollege, Oxford, and a millionaire, stood for the seat and won. He would hold itfor the rest of his life.A further justification for the extraordinary British decision to recogniseWaterboer’s claim to Griqualand West has emerged in recent years – and it wouldimpinge directly on Rhodes’s secret vision. The imperial dream of the time,shared and later championed by Rhodes and his Secret Society, was of a UnitedStates of Africa, starting with a federation of all the states of South Africa.But if the Boer republics were allowed to claim the diamond fields they wouldhave grown richer than the Cape. Moreover, they would likely have formedpolitical and military ententes with Germany’s African colonies, thus scupperingany imperial plan for a continental federation. Indeed, the governor of theCape, Sir Henry Barkly, had considerably exceeded his authority when he annexedthe diamond fields and installed his commissioners. It was thereforeunsurprising when, in 1872, the Cape legislature, which was packed with wealthyDutch farmers, refused to vote funds to run the annexed territory.But all this was still in the future, and Rhodes in the meantime had beenreunited with his teenage friend Caesar Hawkins – the first of many blue-eyedboys with whom he would share his affections. While gossipy Lewis Michell is thesource, it should be remembered that Michell was the only biographer who hadfull access to Rhodes’s private papers: ‘Early in 1871, while still strenuouslyat work, Cecil was fortunate enough to secure a companion of about his own age.This was Henry Caesar Hawkins who, on leaving an English public school, came toNatal where his father was at one time an officer of the first Royals, nowResident Magistrate of the Upper Umkomaas.’That is undoubtedly an understatement. The two young neighbours were peas from apod, and Caesar decided he would also give up cotton and join his friend inKimberley. ‘A friendship soon sprung up between the two and in their sparemoments they studied together.’ This is surely another understatement. Otheraccounts describe how Rhodes dreamed and debated with Caesar Hawkins about aworldwide English autocracy run by a secret society with rules as rigid as thoseof the Spanish Inquisition. Hawkins joined the band of brothers as a foundermember, and in Kimberley the two young men ‘messed’ together and continued todebate the ideas that would eventually form the basis for Rhodes’s SecretSociety.Surrounded by the chaos of the Kimberley pit and its vagabond community, Rhodesmust also have pondered another of his lifelong obsessions: how human societiesdescended into anarchy. Michell, who had attended some of these debates,eulogises the Colossus, claiming that he rose Loyola-like above the socialchaos, the anti-Semitism and the racism, the drunkenness and the godlessness ofKimberley, and planned a better way to govern the world. Was Rhodes in factderanged, a trifle unhinged, by the bizarre life he lived in Kimberley? EvenMichell would seem to think that this was the case. He wonders how Rhodes’sfriends would have viewed the codicil to his first will: ‘Had they seen thisastonishing document, they might well have questioned the sanity of his mind.’When one considers how Rhodes lived – in an unsanitary tin shack without runningwater – and with whom he lived – a mixture of ruffians, Jewish diamond buyersand money lenders, poets, sons of the world’s aristocracy, black peasants fromremote tribes – in an environment of murder, mayhem and drunkenness, there isevery possibility that there was a touch of madness in this nineteen-year-oldson of the manse. Yet it was here, on the edge of the Big Hole, and clutchingMarcus Aurelius as his bible, that Rhodes refined his plan for a secret society,led by himself, that would eventually control the world. And so the SecretSociety was formed – and eventually reformed by Rhodes’s acolyte, Alfred Milner,into an international society of such huge influence it was for many years atthe heart of British governance, to the extent that it would eventuallynegotiate peace in the Great War.It should be remembered that young Cecil Rhodes was a complete anomaly in thiscommunity of hell-raisers. There are many accounts attesting to this fact.Artist Norman Garstin, who lived with Rhodes in 1872, has left us with a vividpen-portrait of a boy floating loftily above this human cesspool: ‘Eccentric anda dreamer … his eyes on a book, or his mind deep in thought … it often seemedthat the larger part of his brain was dealing with something of which no oneelse had cognisance.’2 [part0037.html#ch3fn-2] Frank Rhodes gives furtherinsight into his brother in a letter to their mother: ‘Fair, blue-eyed and withsomewhat aquiline features he stood out in flannels of the school playing field,somewhat shrunken with strenuous rather than effective washing, that still leftthe colour of the red veld dust. He once asked me “I dare say you think I amkeen about money. I assure you I wouldn’t greatly care if I lost all of ittomorrow.”’3 [part0037.html#ch3fn-3]Caesar Hawkins was Rhodes’s closest friend at this time, and the two young menhad many long discussions, turning over ideas they had formulated during theirtime on the cotton farm. They made a firm pact that as soon as they could affordit they would return to England and go up to Oxford University. But in themeantime these two teenage boys had to survive the hell hole of Kimberley asthey began to make their fortunes.Today, the hole is a popular local attraction which tourists may visit by trainalong the track built by Rhodes as the first part of his route from Cape toCairo. It seems inconceivable that this was once a mine teeming with a diversemob, all hand-digging for diamonds, and that the water-filled hole had producedsuch extraordinary wealth.* * *Rhodes clearly had a magnetism which attracted like-minded ‘brothers’, many ofwhom had come to Africa for health reasons – but also to seek their fortune.They included Rhodes’s lifelong friend and doctor, Leander Starr Jameson, andhis business associate Charles Dunnell Rudd, whose acute business brain andforesight helped steer Rhodes towards complete ownership of most of Kimberley;later, Rudd helped him to win the concession that guaranteed him control of amassive piece of Africa that came to be called Rhodesia.Rudd, a Harrow and Cambridge man nine years Rhodes’s senior, had, prior tomeeting Rhodes, been risking his life grubbing for diamonds in the infamous pit.His experiences provide an accurate image of what life was like in this ‘placefit for devils’. For weeks on end, Rudd survived on mealie meal and rottingvenison, ‘staggering 300 yards from his claim to wash and sieve his heavy loadsof gravel with the waters of the river’.4 [part0037.html#ch3fn-4] Typhoid almostkilled him, but his fortunes rose when he began to sell mining services and tobuy and sell diamonds. It was then that he met Rhodes.A Scot, Rudd was dour and cautious, something of a foil to Rhodes – who thrilledat what he called ‘the Game’. They had very different objectives: Rudd wanted toaccumulate a personal fortune, while Rhodes wanted to expand the Empire. Thedifference in their ages resulted in Rudd being regarded as a role model, indeedfather figure. In fact, Rhodes was the actual decision-maker and Rudd oftenturned a blind eye to Rhodes’s more dubious dealings, in particular the deal tocontrol the land that became Rhodesia. Significantly, Rudd was happily married,and while he was never involved in the Secret Society, he must have known aboutit.* * *By 1872, Rhodes had moved out of his tent and had settled in the Old Rushquarter of the ramshackle town. Here the band of brothers was part of what mightbe termed a social community with budding social pretensions. A contemporary ofRhodes observed: ‘Many gentlemen blessed with wives and families have encampedhere and made themselves comparatively comfortable. And the English elementpredominates pleasingly over the Dutch or Boer.’The New Rush suburb, according to the acerbic Lord Kimberley, remained ‘rowdy’:‘Nothing is more common than to see canteens adorned with a row of dead-drunkcorpses at 10 a.m. Policemen there are none and they [the drunks] never appearin the streets unless three parts gone.’With Herbert still away, Rhodes was joined by his older brother, Frank. Amilitary man who would devote his entire life to Rhodes, Frank did much of hisyounger brother’s dirty work. For these services – which would result in himserving time in a Boer jail – Frank alone of Rhodes’s siblings was rewarded witha small slice of Rhodes’s English estate, though the allowance was onlyavailable during Frank’s lifetime.Rhodes shared bachelor quarters with a band of brothers. The group gained areputation for being intellectual, and came to be known, rather mockingly, asthe ‘Twelve Apostles’ – clearly an early model for the Secret Society. The‘Apostles’ has a Jesuit echo,5 [part0037.html#ch3fn-5] and it was in thesemeetings that Rhodes undoubtedly discovered and debated the ties that bindsecret societies. Caesar Hawkins wrote in a letter:I found Cecil very much grown and a man of some importance and authority. He anda few others had a small mess in a wood and iron house, between Kimberley and DeBeers. Among others there were the late Sir Jacob Barry and Sir Sidney Shippard.I frequently dined there with Rhodes, and was always much struck with the leadhe took in any discussion, and the attention paid to whatever he said by menmuch older than himself.Then, just as it had with cotton, the bottom dropped out of the diamond market.The crisis was the consequence of working conditions at the hole, which by nowwere so awful that diamond digging no longer seemed an economic proposition, andpeople left. Rudd and Rhodes sensed an opportunity in this, working together ontheir claims: ‘Very hard manual work when labour became scarce,’ said Rudd,describing how they ‘carried the “paydirt” in bags, boxes or buckets to thesorting tables’. Rhodes broke his finger in the process, but their determinationto survive saved them, and they soon began to diversify.As prices slumped they bought up abandoned claims, as well as parts of claims,and began to provide services to the mine, becoming successful entrepreneurs.Rudd started a rope and machinery business that eventually became the largest inSouth Africa, and Rhodes went to the Cape where he bought old agricultural steamengines that were converted into water pumps. It was not long before he wontenders to save two flooded mines, Du Toit’s Pan and Old De Beers.Though fuel for these ‘asthmatic’ old threshing machine engines was difficult tofind, Rhodes was not deterred: he ‘had a shaggy Basuto pony and an old yellowcart in which he scoured the country before sunrise to waylay the great Boerwagons as they lumbered towards the Kimberley market’.6 [part0037.html#ch3fn-6]Together, Rudd and Rhodes bought and sold anything and everything, anticipatingbuyers’ needs. One of their most successful ventures was the aforementionedice-cream maker. Francis Robert Thompson, an interpreter Rhodes later used inMatabeleland, provides the following amusing description of the men’s ice-creamparlour:You are to imagine the great Cecil Rhodes standing behind a white cottonblanket, slung across a tent, turning a handle of a bucket ice-cream machine,and passing the finished article to Rudd to sell from a packing case at one ofthe corners of the Diamond Market. The ice-cream retailed at sixpence awine-glass full, with an extra sixpence for a slab of cake.But there was a more serious side to all this. Still only nineteen years old,Rhodes realised that ‘the small man will soon be compelled to quit the diamondgame’. The Cape government also came to this conclusion, and as miners abandonedthe diggings in their thousands, the government eased the rules on how manyclaims an individual could hold. ‘Consolidation’ became the buzzword.Rhodes looked to developments in the United States of America, and took these ashis model. Railways were opening up in the USA, and the gargantuan oil monopolyStandard Oil was being consolidated by John D. Rockefeller – a monopoly thatended in 1914, however, with the passing of the Clayton Antitrust Act.Rhodes had just turned twenty, and the times were desperate: heavy rains floodedthe Kimberley mine, and just after that the Vienna Bourse collapsed, impactingon diamond prices. Thousands of tons of yellow soil came down, burying accessroads and the blue ground claims below. Rhodes cabled friends in Cape Town: ‘NewRush full of water no money coming in from ground all going out.’Seemingly unperturbed, Rhodes simply packed his bags and departed for Oxford,leaving Rudd to steer their partnership through the growing mining recession.Rhodes had come to believe that, unlike lesser mortals, he had the benefit ofdivine guidance7 [part0037.html#ch3fn-7] – and so he blithely sailed forEngland. There are two other examples of this type of behaviour which I willdeal with in more detail later but are worth mentioning here. The first was theoutlandish decision to invade and occupy a vast chunk of southern Africa whichhe then named after himself; the second was his key involvement in the attemptto take over the Boer republics by armed force, in the incident that came to beknown as the Jameson Raid. The army he raised for the former incursion numberedjust over 200 men, who would have to face thousands of disciplined, regimentedMatabele warriors. The Matabele never attacked this tiny ‘Pioneer Column’,however. The raid on the Boer republics – a clear act of war – was also mountedby a few hundred fighting men, who included Rhodes’s brother Frank.An alternative explanation for Rhodes’s strange behaviour is that he had come tobelieve in luck after his diamond-field experience, and that he had developed ataste for risk-taking in the tradition of the Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, Astors,Guggenheims and Carnegies. A number of these American moguls, including JayGould and the Rothschild and Barings bankers, were already active in the diamondfields, buying up claims as fast as they became available.Yet there is nothing in Rhodes’s conventional Christian upbringing that promotedambitions of this kind – apart, perhaps, from the missionary fervour of thetime. On the other hand, Rhodes frequently mentioned his love of the game andwas often quite careless, if not disdainful, of money. At this early age atleast, he appears to have allowed himself few indulgences apart from books, anda lot of ‘brooding’ (Rudyard Kipling later described this ‘brooding spirit’ asthe source of his genius).Rhodes wrote to Frank, candidly confessing, ‘Really what is life worth at mypresent mode of existence with no object, no aim?’ Significantly, he added: ‘Icannot help feeling I was made for better things.’ Quite clearly, the idea ofhis Secret Society had begun to take shape, and much earlier than most havesuggested.The most telling description of Rhodes at the time remains that of NormanGarstin, who seems to sense hidden obsessions:I seem to see a fair young man, frequently sunk in deep thoughts, his handsburied in his trouser pockets, his legs crossed and possibly twisted together,quite oblivious of the talk around him; then without a word he would get up andgo out with some set purpose in his mind which he was at no pains to communicate… He was a compound of moody silence and impulsive action. He was hot and evenviolent at times, but in working towards his ends he laid his plans with careand circumspection … The duality of his nature, the contemplative and theexecutive, had a curious counterpoint in his voice, which broke, when he wasexcited, into a sort of falsetto, unusual in a man of his make; his laugh alsohad this falsetto note.Then there is the sketch by diamond buyer Louis Cohen, hinting at a darker sideto Rhodes: ‘Leaning moodily with hands in his pockets against a street wall. Hehardly ever had a companion, seemingly took no interest in anything but his ownthoughts, and I do not believe if a flock of the most adorable women passedthrough the street he would go across the street to see them. For the fair sexhe cared nothing.’Rhodes’s inclination for male company was by now becoming apparent, andquestions regarding sexual preference have inevitably been asked about a numberof the ‘brothers’, some of whom did, however, marry and have children. ThoughRhodes was very close to several of the band, there is more evidence ofintellectual than sexual intimacy. The ‘brothers’ included many aesthetes,including the architect Reginald Fairlie; Norman Garstin, who would become awell-known fin de siècle artist; H.C. Steppings Wright, who became an artist forThe London Illustrated News; and William Scully, who went on to become arespected South African poet and novelist. Their presence in this company is aharbinger of Rhodes’s later preference for male company such as that provided byJohn Verschoyle and Reginald Baliol Brett, both of whom fancied themselves‘aesthetes’.Several others became successful politicians and civil servants; among thesewere Jacob Berry, who was later knighted and became judge president of the Cape,and Sidney Godolphin Shippard, later Sir Sidney, who was the first administratorof Bechuanaland. Alfred Beit, together with Rhodes and Charles Rudd, became amulti-millionaire businessman. Beit, a German Jew, began by valuing and sellingraw diamonds, and eventually bequeathed a large part of his vast fortune to thefurtherance of the aims of Rhodes’s Secret Society. To this day, there is a BeitTrust and a Beit Fund at Oxford University, used for purposes that promote thestudy of the history of the British Empire and Commonwealth.* * *After Rhodes moved out of the brick-and-tin ‘mess’ he had occupied with his‘brothers’ in Kimberley, he shared lodgings with his siblings Herbert and Frank,and his friend Scully. But now Rhodes, already a successful young businessman –who occasionally met his academic obligations in Oxford – went a significantstep further: he set up house with his secretary, Neville Pickering. The two menlived together, apparently very happily, for years, until Pickering’s fatalhorse accident sometime later. The debates and arguments that Rhodes enjoyedwith his band of brothers filled many long hours in the intellectual desert ofthe diggings. The mundane business of grubbing for diamonds was set aside forweightier talk, particularly with Sidney Shippard and Caesar Hawkins, about howto put the world to rights and ‘the Game’ as Rhodes always referred to it.For the Victorians, the phrase came to have a particular meaning, and it waslater immortalised in the novels of Rudyard Kipling and John Buchan, both ofwhom were close friends of Rhodes. Essentially, the Game – or ‘the Great Game’ –was English imperialism, facilitated by upper-class ‘secret agents’ who weregenerally members of secret societies and who usually had three things incommon: a public-school education, a token university degree, and privatewealth. These agents operated on the frontiers of the Empire, were experts atpassing themselves off as natives, and all belonged to prestigious London clubs.The most notable literary exponent of the Game was John Buchan, who remainedclosely connected to the Secret Society, right up to the time Milner took itover from Rhodes. Buchan was a political officer during his time in Africa (hisnovel Prester John depicts an agent infiltrating a secret society), while Rhodespromoted Empire by means of a clandestine society, military operations andcross-border gunrunning. Buchan eventually became a highly esteemed ‘greatgamer’: as Lord Tweedsmuir, peer of the realm and governor general of Canada,Buchan was one of the first in a string of influential diplomats to graduatefrom Milner’s metamorphosed Secret Society.It is remarkable that Rhodes, only twenty years old when he left for Oxford in1873, already had plans for a life of undercover political manoeuvring thatwould reshape the world. Indeed, he was just a couple of years away from drawingup a will designed to do exactly that. Rhodes’s biographers have generally beenbewildered by his time at Oriel, straining to resurrect the boy obsessed withGibbon’s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, the youth captivated by obscureclassics, the admirer of Marcus Aurelius who thrived on intellectual debate.What adds to the confusion is the fact that, at this point of his life, therewas not the slightest hint that, buried deep inside Cecil John Rhodes, was aplayboy-dandy straining to get out. This confusion is clear in Harold Hensman’sCecil Rhodes, where the author struggles to reconcile these contradictions,resorting to distortion in the attempt:In 1873 the young man quitted the democratic and cosmopolitan community of thediamond fields to enter the quiet studious atmosphere which ever hangs over auniversity town. During the time he was at Oxford it was Rhodes’s habit to spendthe summer term at the university, and then at the end of about six months toreturn to the Cape and the diamond fields.To describe Kimberley as ‘a democratic and cosmopolitan community’ is risible,to say the least. Yet Hensman continues: ‘He also avoided the rigours of theEnglish winter, for though by this time he seems to have shaken off the effectsof his chest complaint, to have wintered in England would have been to submithis lungs to a strain under which they would have probably broken down oncemore.’ This is in sharp contrast to the image of Rhodes provided by a digger,George Beet, who describes a young man with ‘light brown wavy hair, parted onthe left side. In disposition he seemed extremely reserved, although in realityhe was not so, but certainly one had to know him first in order to get over thisimpression. To me he never showed any signs of lung trouble …’8[part0037.html#ch3fn-8]The facts are that twenty-year-old Rhodes arrived at Oxford, wearing what wouldbecome his trademark ‘bags’, a chamois pouch of uncut diamonds in his pocket,and that he sat a Latin entrance examination for University College – which hefailed. Yet Oxford was not the end for this strangely attired Rhodes, but ratheran extraordinary beginning. It was the starting point in a saga of epicproportions, which Rhodes set in motion: the hoard of diamonds, the piles ofgold, the mysticism and secret societies, King Solomon’s mines and biblicalOphir, and political and sexual intrigues involving princes, presidents andprime ministers. There were huge successes and spectacular failures. And aboveall, there was the growing influence of his Secret Society and its eventual role– under Milner – in rescuing England from defeat in the Great War.A significant factor in these developments is Rhodes’s homosexuality. Within thespace of a few years he would be mingling with a powerful coterie of allegedlygay, lesbian and bisexual men and women, all of whom would become members of, orbe politically associated with, his Secret Society. Prominent in this group weretwo prime ministers, Lord Balfour and Lord Rosebery, a royal mistress, DaisyGreville, a prime minister’s wife, Margot Asquith, and Reginald Baliol Brett,who had the ear of three generations of royalty, from Queen Victoria to KingGeorge. Brett himself was a self-confessed pederast.But before Rhodes could rise to these dizzy social heights and pursue hisimperial hopes and dreams, he had to succeed at Oxford. Undeterred by hisfailure to gain entry to University College, he strode brazenly down ‘the High’,determined to square things with Caesar Hawkins’s uncle at Oriel."},{"pageContent":"4The Secret PyramidUniversity College, or ‘Univ’, took 90 per cent of its ‘men’ from publicschools. Rhodes, however, had not attended a public school. Thus the collegemaster, Dr D.G.G. Bradley, rejected Rhodes – thereby making the worst decisionof his career.Unabashed by this rebuff, Rhodes approached the provost of Oriel College, whohappened to be the uncle of his good friend Caesar Hawkins. There are severalapocryphal accounts of the interview, the most common having Provost Hawkinsstare down at young Rhodes in hostile silence as he says, ‘All the colleges sendme their failures.’ Another has Hawkins study Rhodes’s letter of introduction,then dismissively exclaim, ‘Pff. So the Master of University sends me hisleavings,’ upon which Rhodes protests vigorously. Hawkins eventually lets him in– an early signal of Rhodes’s persuasive skills, perhaps.Whatever the facts, Rhodes became a Man at Oxford in October 1873, by then toolate to permit residence in the college. He had to study hard to pass the entrytest to the classics course known as Responsions, but pass he did – at a price,however: soon afterwards he was struck down by a ‘life-threatening’ chill,allegedly after rowing on the Isis.The chill, developing into ‘pneumonia’ or possibly even ‘pleurisy’, finds itsplace in history propelled by little more than Chinese whispers, appearing asgospel in the early biographies; this in spite of the fact that Rhodes, soonafter the alleged episode, records that he is feeling very well. In support ofthese versions is the rumoured medical report of a Dr Morrel Mackenzie who sendsRhodes back to Africa with ‘but a few months to live’. It is a diagnosis thathas become pivotal in the myth of Rhodes, portraying him as ‘a soul driven bythe spectre of death’. There have been several failed attempts to locate DrMackenzie’s casebook, especially since Rhodes’s autopsy revealed no evidence ofconsumptive or tubercular lesions. Nevertheless, upon his return to Kimberley,his friends, the Curreys, reported that ‘he was subject at this time to bleedingfrom one lung’.This is not surprising, however, as it was winter and snow was falling in thearid area around Kimberley, making the air dry and hard to breathe. Moreover,the Curreys’ shack was ‘hardly habitable in winter’. Robert Rotberg is wary ofthis story and his research provides another angle on the incident: afterinitially feeling well on the voyage home, Rhodes fell ill again, only torecover by the time he reached Cape Town. Somewhat pointedly, Rotberg continuesthe tale: ‘So fearful had he been of fourteen days alone in a wagon from theCape to Kimberley that he had engaged a young steward from the boat to lookafter him along the road as the steward had done aboard the ship.’Halfway home, Rhodes had written to his father to report that the voyage hadleft him feeling better than he had been, declaring, ‘I have quite got over thedepression I used to have.’ But perhaps there is an entirely differentexplanation for Rhodes’s condition. In the middle of his cramming to get intoOxford, Rhodes’s mother had died of a ‘seizure’ following months of ill health.At the time, a seizure usually meant a stroke. Rhodes was devastated by hismother’s death. A note by a Mrs Bennett describes him on his way to PlymouthHarbour suddenly burying his head in his hands and sobbing uncontrollably.The African sun worked its magic, however, and with the assistance of the burlyship’s steward who tended Rhodes along the way to Kimberley, as well as the helpof the Currey family, Rhodes was soon back in good health. He had spent justthat one term at Oxford in 1873 before finally quitting until 1876. Unlike theother Oxford men, he was running his life in reverse: career first, educationsecond. And yet by the time he arrived at Oxford and ensured his place wassecure, both careers – the hard-nosed diamond business and his playboyuniversity business – were already being pushed to the background by thecolossal adventure that was lurking at the back of his mind. The Great Game wason, and he would be a major player.Back in Kimberley, there was much work to be done to get the diamond business onits feet again. Conditions had worsened considerably. Despairing civic officialsprotested that the ratio of bars – serving a brandy concoction called Cape Smokeand a cane-spirit rum called witblits (white lightning) – had risen to one forevery forty inhabitants.Nobody with a weak constitution or whose lungs were bleeding could have possiblywithstood these conditions, suggesting that the Currey account is dubious. It isalso true, and certainly ironic, that Kimberley, once the open-cast mining cameto an end and the dust cleared from the high desert air, became a populardestination for asthma sufferers – thanks in no small part to the railway linethat Rhodes had built from Cape Town. It drew in a number of characters, amongthem Olive Schreiner, who will feature later in our story.* * *In Kimberley the festering political disputes were, if anything, even worse thanthe digging conditions. The two neighbouring Boer republics still laid claim tothe diamond fields, though the British intervention had forced them to sit backand watch as 50,000 foreigners, whom the puritanical Boers perceived as drunksand whore-mongers, settled in as their neighbours.These Uitlanders – mostly foreigners like Rhodes – held the Boers in contempt;their scorn embraced the illiterate old president, Oom (Uncle) Paul Kruger, aswell as what they perceived as a scattering of peasant farmers occupying vaststretches of unfenced veld. For men like Rhodes, this was all simply to bebrushed aside, and the land incorporated into a proper English-speaking colonyas soon as troops could be diverted from the Kaffir Wars to do the job.The Boers had no idea that a stripling Uitlander, Cecil John Rhodes, had alreadybegun to dream of an Africa in which they would play no part whatsoever –unless, of course, they agreed to play a passive role. In Rhodes’s scheme ofthings, if the republics remained in Boer hands they would be nothing butroadblocks on the British highway he was planning from the Cape to Cairo.However, Rhodes did occasionally let his guard drop in the presence ofstrangers. There is, for example, the story beloved of Rhodes’s earlybiographers, where Captain Charles Warren1 [part0037.html#ch4fn-1] observes uponmeeting up with Rhodes en route to the diamond fields: ‘It was impossible not torecognise that he [Rhodes] had every prospect of a brilliant career.’ Had thecaptain been a closer observer, he might have reported that the pretentiousyoung man was a religious bigot spouting jingoistic nonsense (typical of manyBritish who were abroad at the time). Instead, we have the following: ‘Herelieved the tedium of the post-cart journey by intent study of the Book ofCommon prayer … and mastering the Thirty-Nine Articles2 [part0037.html#ch4fn-2]of the Anglican Church.’ Rhodes had also tucked away in his bags the draft ofhis Confession of Faith. Without realising it, Captain Warren was also presentedwith a broad outline of the aims and principles of the planned Secret Society,as Rhodes pronounced on man’s place in the universe, and predestination.It should be pointed out that the Confession of Faith provides significantevidence of Rhodes’s latent homosexuality. Psychologists claim that, givenRhodes’s deep devotion to his mother, his Oedipal desire to be part of a band ofbrothers indicates repressed sexual impulses. He never outgrew his boyhoodeither, as Rotberg points out:That Rhodes remained a pre-adolescent in so many significant respects and thesepre-adolescent characteristics shaped his striving for greatness, is clear.During Cecil’s school years the band of brothers substituted in important waysfor the absent masculine influence of his father … Lacking it, Rhodes repeatedlysought the support of a gang or band. Subsequently in his personal relationshipshe always gravitated to friends or lovers with whom he could stay young.Be that as it may, Anthony Sampson’s recent insights remain cogent: ‘thecharacter of Rhodes – with his combination of shrewdness and adolescence,romanticism and ruthlessness, imagination and vulgarity, has eluded all hisbiographers’.The actual birth of the Secret Society – in Rhodes’s so-called lost years of1873 to 1876 – occurred in very humble surroundings in Kimberley, which werefortunately recorded by Lewis Michell, who attended with at least four otheryoung men. Rhodes confessed to huge imperial ambitions, adding that theaccumulation of wealth was no longer his prime objective:Gentlemen I have asked you to dine because I want to tell you what I want to dowith the remainder of my life. I think that if a man when he is young determinesto devote his life to one worthy object and persists in that he can do a greatdeal during that life even if it is to be a short one as I know my life will be.The object to which I intend to devote my life is the defence and the extensionof the British Empire. The British Empire stands for the protection of all theinhabitants of a country in life, liberty, fair play and happiness and is thegreatest platform the world has ever seen for these purposes … It is mainly theextension of the Empire northwards that we have to watch and work for in SouthAfrica.3 [part0037.html#ch4fn-3]His audience, which included bankers and a civil servant, applauded. One of thegroup, Joseph Orpen, would go into politics, and he agreed that the Britishgovernment was ‘fundamentally the best’. They decided to form a secret societyand to exchange ideas on Rhodes’s ‘principals and points’. Joseph Orpensuggested members should be required to include a secret sign in all writtencorrespondence – ‘the symbol of a five on the dice’ – which would identify ‘ThePyramid of Brothers’. No further records of meetings exist, though this wasclearly a decision taken by the group.The members maintained close ties. Michell remained Rhodes’s banker and becamehis first biographer. Some years later, together with Rhodes, Joseph Orpenentered the Cape Parliament. They were, respectively, members for Kimberley andGriqualand West. In time, and with Orpen at his side, Rhodes would become primeminister.* * *Though Rhodes had an expanding business to run, he also needed to fulfil therequirements for his Oxford degree. He had to put in a total of nine terms, buthad completed only one term in 1873. He put in three when he returned in 1876,all four in 1877, two in 1878, and the Michaelmas Term in 1881, the year he wasfinally awarded a mediocre degree. Midway through this period, however, thespectre of frail health rose to haunt him once again.He is said to have suffered a heart attack, but at twenty-four Rhodes was trimand fit, and the vascular enlargement that eventually killed him was still morethan two decades in the future, as were the bad habits which probably caused it.Michell’s record of this attack is bizarre in the extreme: ‘It so shook hisnerves that his friends once found him in his room, blue with fright, his doorbarricaded with a chest of drawers and other furniture; he insisted that he hadseen a ghost.’ These are surely not the actions of a man who has just had aheart attack, or indeed ‘seen a ghost’? Rhodes would have sought help, notboarded himself up.Was Rhodes having some kind of nervous breakdown – a fairly common occurrence inthe early years of student life? He was certainly a prime candidate, as thingswere tough in Kimberley, his beloved mother had died, and he was far frommeeting his obligations at Oxford. Sadly, no primary evidence exists that thisincident ever actually happened. None of the friends who found him in a bluefunk ever identified themselves, and the only indication that something hadhappened to scare Rhodes in the summer of 1877 is his determination to finalisethe draft of his Confession of Faith by June, and to write the first of his manywills, which was completed in September of that year.Michell includes a verbatim copy of this Confession in his biography of Rhodes.The legalistic introduction is followed by a handwritten section where Rhodesdescribes himself as ‘Of Oriel College, Oxford, but presently of Kimberley inthe province of Griqualand West.’ He begins with a typical rhetorical flourish:‘It often strikes a man to inquire what is the chief good in life’, but it isthe text which follows that makes it such a unique and extraordinary document:I leave all my worldly goods in trust (to the Secretary of State for theColonies, Lord Carnarvon, and Sidney Godolphin Shippard now of the Inner Temple)To and for the establishment, promotion and development of, a Secret Society,the true aim and object thereof shall be the extension of British rulethroughout the world, the perfecting of a system of immigration from the UnitedKingdom, and of colonisation by British subjects of all lands where the means oflivelihood are attainable by energy, labour and enterprise, and especially theoccupation by British settlers of the entire Continent of Africa, the Holy Land,the Valley of the Euphrates, the islands of Cyprus and Candia, the whole ofSouth America, the Islands of the Pacific not heretofore possessed by GreatBritain, the whole of the Malay Archipelago, the seaboard of China and Japan,the ultimate recovery of the United States of America as an integral part of theBritish Empire, the inauguration of a system of Colonial representation in theImperial Parliament which may tend to weld together the disjointed members ofthe Empire, and, finally, the foundation of so great a Power as to hereafterrender wars impossible and promote the best interests of humanity.This surely numbers among the most deranged set of objectives ever compiled, andreads more like fiction – the stuff of John Buchan’s The Thirty-Nine Steps orEdgar Wallace’s The Four Just Men. Yet this was not some mad impulse: Rhodes hadbeen turning these ideas over in his mind for months, if not years.4[part0037.html#ch4fn-4] Apart from that single incident with the ghost, there isno record of mental illness. Indeed, within a few years Rhodes would be a primeminister and a privy councillor. How, then, did he come to believe that all thiscould be achieved by a secret society?Though the Confession was attached as a codicil to Rhodes’s first will, it isunlikely it was entirely his own work. The trustee, Sidney Shippard, a member ofthe Kimberley band of brothers and an African colonial officer, was a player inmany of Rhodes’s more outrageous adventures and also a close and loyal friend.He went on to Oxford at about the same time as Rhodes, and he will feature largein this account.* * *In South Africa, the Secret Society remained secret from its inception. It wasonly in 1912 that Lewis Michell revealed its existence, when in his biography herecords the first meeting of the Pyramid of Brothers. He goes on to reportRhodes’s claim that he had ‘never deviated from the policy we laid down then’ –a policy that, presumably, was known to the ‘brothers’ and to others associatedwith the group, as well as to Rhodes’s close friends. Caesar Hawkins, if not aco-author of the Confession, was almost certainly a member of the Society, aswas Sidney Shippard. Both were in the band of brothers and formed part of theTwelve Apostles, and both were at Oxford with Rhodes. Alfred Beit certainlywould have known of the existence of the Society, as would certain notaries andlawyers.The question remains: did Rhodes really believe the United States would agree tobeing reintegrated into the British Empire? Or China or Japan – or ‘the whole ofSouth America’ for that matter? Far from being a scheme to ‘render warsimpossible’, this outrageous plan would have set the world alight.And then there is the bewildering fact that at the time he wrote the Confession,Rhodes did not possess a fortune to bequeath. He was in fact borrowing money forday-to-day expenses from his rich Aunt Sophy. The Confession also hints atRhodes’s emerging awareness of his sexual orientation, by suggesting that he wasunlikely to marry and have dependants.* * *Despite the grandiosity of the secret plan, Rhodes and his successors managed toachieve many of its objectives. For one, the British designed an immigrationsystem that allowed ‘the colonisation by British subjects of all lands where themeans of livelihood are attainable by energy, labour and enterprise, andespecially the occupation by British settlers of the entire Continent ofAfrica’. I as a child was one of them.It is possible that Rhodes did not actually believe that all the ideals heoutlined could be realised, and the Confession may simply have been a kind ofimperial wish list. But what he did believe is that he could deliver Africa tothe British, and he continued to keep his dreams alive behind a shield ofclandestine societies, a shield which still protects those dreams today.When I first discussed the Confession with Professor Jeremy Catto, eminenthistorian and former dean of Oriel, he shared my incredulity regarding Rhodes’sgrandiose schemes. He did, however, come up with a theory explaining theseextreme imperialist views: ‘These were very early thoughts. I dare say he didn’tthink anyone would ever see them. In fact, would anyone ever have heard of theConfession had not Sir Lewis Michell revealed it in his biography of Rhodes?’Rhodes made several wills, all but the last of which contain elements of theConfession, though nothing quite as radical as the first will. The originalConfession will is preserved at Rhodes House in Oxford. The first seriousdiscussion of it and the Confession occurred in a book published in March 1902,immediately after Rhodes’s death, by W.T. Stead, who earned the reputation ofbeing the world’s first investigative journalist. Stead’s Last Will andTestament of Cecil John Rhodes contains intriguing insights.One of the more bizarre characters in his life, Rhodes sought Stead out whilethe latter was serving a prison sentence for hiring a child prostitute (Steadwas at the time investigating child sexual exploitation). Something of apsychic, who forecast his own death with uncanny accuracy, Stead eventuallybecame head of the Secret Society in England, and was for a time heir toRhodes’s entire fortune. He was clearly devoted to Rhodes, but the two men had amajor row over the Boer War.Stead describes Rhodes’s quasi-religious state of excitement in the monthsbefore he penned the Confession. This claim is partly supported by CharlesWarren’s report of Rhodes’s absorption in the Book of Common Prayer and theAnglican Creed at the time. The following is a sample of Rhodes’s inchoateramblings recorded by Stead: the creation of an English hegemony which wouldtransform parts of the world ‘at present inhabited by the most despicablespecimens of human beings’; the English were ‘the finest race in the world andthe more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race’; ‘Weshould recover the United States, lost to us by 18th Century “pig headed”English statesmen and get rid of “low class” Irish and German immigrants … If wehad retained America there would be … millions more of the English living’;‘Africa is still lying ready for us [and] it is our duty to take it’; Britishexpansion would result in an increase in the ‘most honourable race the worldpossesses’. And regarding Rhodes’s first conception of the Secret Society, Steadhas the following to say:The idea gleaming and dancing before ones eyes like a will-of-the-wisp at lastframes itself into a plan. Why should we not form a secret society with but oneobject, the furtherance of the British Empire and the bringing of the wholeuncivilised world under British rule. A Church for the extension of the BritishEmpire. A society which should have its members in every part of the BritishEmpire working with one object and one idea. Some of these men would besupported financially once they had been bound by an oath to serve the secretsociety.Stead goes on to sketch the type of membership which Rhodes sought:Take the case of the younger son with high thoughts, high aspirations, endowedby nature with all the faculties to make a great man, and with a sole wish inlife to serve his Country but he lacks two things the means and the opportunity,he is compelled to pass his time in some occupation which furnishes him with amere existence, he lives unhappily and dies miserably.One should be cautious of viewing the aspirations of the Victorian imperialiststhrough a contemporary lens. Viewed thus, most of the above is unconscionable.However, when Victorian imperialists of the late nineteenth century, men likeClive of India and Gordon of Khartoum, were putting the finishing touches to anEmpire ‘upon which the sun could never set’ – or otherwise die vaingloriously inthe attempt – the majority of English citizens would have supported suchsentiments. Imperialists were widely perceived as doing God’s work and wouldhave been applauded for their proposal of ‘a Church for the extension of theBritish Empire’.5 [part0037.html#ch4fn-5] One of Rhodes’s most loyal andcommitted supporters was, indeed, the founder of the Salvation Army, WilliamBooth.The Victorian writer Anthony Trollope, who made several visits to Kimberley,observed the sweating masses and commented:Who can doubt that work is the great civiliser of the world – work and thegrowing desire for those things which work only will bring … I have not myselfseen the model Christian perfected; but when I have looked down the Kimberleymine and seen three or four thousand of them at work … I have felt I was lookingat three or four thousand growing Christians.By today’s standards, this is indubitably mad. Yet Trollope in his time wasregarded as a liberal moralist. Rhodes’s form of imperial mania – the beliefthat a tiny island in northern Europe could conquer, occupy and govern the world– was, nevertheless, extremely ambitious, even for his times.So how did Rhodes get away with it? How did his 200 fortune-hunters – whoincluded men with police experience and others who seemed to have walkedstraight out of Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show – conquer an area defended by10,000 trained warriors in regiments similar to those which had decimated aBritish army at Isandlwana? And more to the point, how did Rhodes metamorphosefrom a son of the manse to a hungry imperialist with a passion for theseoutrageous adventures? The answer is fairly simple: he believed that Africa wasripe for ‘civilised’ occupation, and that this belief was shared both by hisQueen and his God.‘He wants to eat up my country!’ Lobengula, King of the Matabele, shouted toQueen Victoria. She had met Rhodes and shared Lobengula’s dislike of him, but inthe end apparently decided this conflict, from which she had much to gain andlittle to lose, was best left to the two men concerned.Rhodes espoused an imperialism which he believed had divine approval, and hetook it up with what amounted to evangelistic fervour. When the ground beneathhis feet rewarded him first with handfuls of diamonds and then gold inabundance, he decided that the wealth was manna from heaven which could be usedto fund a secret society for the protection of the Empire. And that was just thestart. In the longer term he envisaged a society benignly ruling the wholeEmpire via its own administrators, while dedicated universities produced worldleaders through richly endowed scholarship programmes. Funds like thoseestablished by Alfred Beit helped pay for this, and examples of the process atwork in recent years are world leaders such as Bill Clinton and Tony Abbott –both of whom are Rhodes Scholars, a fact more fully explored in the pages thatfollow.The Confession of Faith nevertheless has a dreamlike quality, which has causedsome commentators to pour scorn on its unrealistic, visionary aims. But if theConfession is viewed in the context of several experiences when Rhodes ‘saw’ghosts and other demons, it begins to make a kind of sense. We only regard it asstrange because we no longer recognise the ‘church’ in which Rhodes decided toworship. Had Rhodes simply confessed that he had ‘found’ the Christian faith andthen left his money to missionary work, he would have been universallyapplauded. Instead, Rhodes went one step further and established his own churchwith its own dogma, and with disciplines modelled on those of one-time knight,mystic, missionary and ascetic, Ignatius Loyola.From the time of the Confession, Rhodes becomes effectively a Jesuit-style monkin the Imperial Order. This chimera of monasticism explains the peculiarities ofRhodes’s much-hinted-at homosexuality. It is easy to see why Rhodes wasattracted to the Society of Jesus, founded in 1540 by Loyola. This religiousorder was an army of soldiers of God, spreading its message across the world asit converted ‘heathens’. Ignatius began his Society with six young men who metin secret – just like Rhodes did five centuries later.As Rhodes defended his actions against ‘barbarians’ by insisting he was bringing‘civilised standards’, the Jesuits justified their activity on the basis ofbeing part of the Church Militant, fighting to establish God’s kingdom on earth.The Jesuits are today active in 112 nations on six continents, specialising ineducation, research and missionary work, paralleling Rhodes’s Society in manyways.The Jesuits proselytised in accordance with their own rules in order to meettheir desired ends. The rules, which Rhodes effectively copied, allowed Jesuitsthe authority to use whatever means was necessary to accomplish their tasks.This placed them above the state, and the laws of the state. They suppressedseveral heathen tribes, particularly in South America, just as Rhodes tookmilitary action to suppress uprisings by the Matabele and the Shona, even thoughhis only writ was a disputed mining charter.From the time Rhodes founded his ‘faith’ with its bible, the Confession ofFaith, the imperial God seemed to smile ever more benignly on him. Newlyacquired mines began to produce diamonds by the ton, while his brother Herbertbrought reports of a gold bonanza in the far north. Rhodes benefited, too, fromthe advice of Hans Sauer who, like Jameson, was a medical doctor; driven largelyby gut instinct, Sauer urged Rhodes to buy up dirt-poor Boer farms outsideJohannesburg. A few hundred feet under the dirt they found the richest, deepestseam of gold the world has ever known.Soon, no one was able to stand up to Rhodes’s ferocious evangelism. BarneyBarnato, a diamond magnate as rich as Rhodes, was the last to hold out. He atfirst insisted he would only amalgamate with Rhodes to form the De BeersConsolidated Mines if the trust deed for the new company was confined to theprofitable mining of diamonds. Rhodes refused, confessing again to his largervision. By the end of a long evening arguing in Jameson’s Kimberley cottage,Barnato gave in, saying: ‘Some people have a fancy for one thing and some foranother. You have a fancy for making an Empire. Well, I suppose I must give itto you.’"},{"pageContent":"5The Secret LifeFrom the time he made his Confession of Faith and began to regard imperialism asa quasi-religious cause, Rhodes also started to spread his message abroad,displaying what amounted to missionary zeal. And he was not alone. Imperialismwas the God-driven cause of many of the great men and women of his age.General Sir Charles Warren and, later, General ‘Chinese’ Gordon had alreadyspotted something remarkable in young Rhodes. And so did many others, includingthe banker Nathan Rothschild, and Lord Alfred Milner, who by the turn of thecentury had trained an elite corps secretly destined to further Rhodes’s work.Rhodes’s cronies included the British foreign minister Joseph Chamberlain, and ascore or more of the British aristocracy, including the Lords Rosebery (a formerprime minister), Brand, Lothian and, later, Viscount Astor; also the LordsAmery, Selbourne, Grey and, in particular, Lord Esher (Reginald ‘Regy’ Brett),important advisor on political matters to Queen Victoria, and then to Edward VIIand George V.For a man who began life with no political or aristocratic connectionswhatsoever, not a penny to his name and, according to his Oxford professors, noexceptional intellect, Rhodes was soon influencing many of the most powerful menon earth. All of those mentioned above would speak at one time or other of his‘vision’, and several of them knew him as the Colossus – a reference to theColossus of Rhodes of the ancient world. Indeed, there was a time shortly beforethe start of the twentieth century when simply knowing Rhodes appeared to resultin a British knighthood. Lewis Michell reflected on opinions regarding Rhodes’sConfession at the time: ‘Compared with the Empire here formulated, that of Romeseems pale and ineffective … It is easy to laugh at the high-stepping ambitionsof the young digger sitting on the edge of the Kimberley mine, and to disparagethe light that irradiated his day dreams as a light “That never was on sea orland.”’ Michell’s reference to a ‘light that irradiated his day dreams’ suggeststhat Rhodes believed in and pursued the goals in the Confession of Faith, for hesaw the light – a blinding revelatory light shining down on inspirational plansfor a ‘regenerated universe’. This was a divine light, no less! And so, Michellcorrectly insisted that, rather than disparagement, the Confession deservedclose analysis, especially since there is much to be read between the lines:In one comprehensive sentence it reconstituted the world. North America wasrecovered, South America occupied, the Isles of the Pacific colonised, the HolyLand secured for the Zionists, the route to India made safe by the acquisitionof such strategically points [sic] as the Valley of Euphrates, Cyprus andCandia; and then, as a result, the re-united Anglo-Saxon race, one andindivisible, its ships on every sea, its flags on every shore, was to police theworld and permit no shot to be fired and no war-drum to throb throughout aregenerated universe!Had the Confession gone public instead of being the secret code of a clandestinesociety, it may well have been recognised as one of the most dangerous proposalsever devised. Yet though it was secret, the Confession was never dormant.We may pause at this point to look into the future to see how at least one ofRhodes’s ‘day dreams’ – the ‘recovery of the Holy Land for the Zionists’, asMichell put it – developed into a reality. The Balfour Declaration that broughtthis about is proof that in 1917 the evolved Secret Society was active and, withMilner at its head, influencing the Great War. Moreover, Parliament’s approvalof the document is an indication that the Society continued to exercise enormousinfluence right up to the start of the Second World War in 1939.The Balfour Declaration, as was generally believed in 1917, was a letter fromthe British foreign secretary, Arthur Balfour, to Baron Rothschild, offeringPalestine to the Zionists. The Rothschilds had been involved in the SecretSociety from the start: Nathan Rothschild was a trustee of one of Rhodes’swills, whose terms embodied the Confession of Faith. Had Rothschild not agreedwith the goals of the Confession, it is unlikely he would have been assignedthat role. Furthermore, Leopold Amery, who had taken over the running of theevolved Secret Society after Milner’s death in 1925, announced in NevilleChamberlain’s 1937 Parliament that he had written the Balfour Declaration withMilner.This has never been denied or raised eyebrows, perhaps because Milner, then andnow, is remembered not as the head of a secret society but as the super-diplomatwho ended the Great War. More recently, a Welsh academic, W.D. Rubinstein, hasclaimed that most of the drafting was done by Amery. This is unsurprising sinceAmery was Milner’s closest lieutenant, travelling with him to France whenReginald Brett, illicitly running intelligence from France for the Society,called, in some desperation, for Milner to help lay the ground for ending theGreat War.By recording his aims and ambitions in the Confession of Faith, Rhodes sets inmotion a sequence of events which – by the time Milner and Rothschild intervene– change the course of history, particularly in the Middle East: * 1877: In the Confession of Faith, repatriation to the Holy Land is listed as one of Rhodes’s objectives. * 1890s: The plan relating to the Holy Land is exported to Britain when Rhodes pays W.T. Stead a visit at the behest of Reginald Brett, and, inspired by Gordon, plans to set up a secret society there. * 1902: Rhodes’s new trustee, the political proconsul Alfred Milner, takes over the leadership of the Society after Rhodes’s death. * 1911: Milner actively – though secretly – promotes Rhodes’s goals as mooted in the Confession of Faith, in particular British–American reintegration, an imperial federation and British settlement in the Holy Land. * 1917: Milner, together with Amery, devises a strategy to implement the plan concerning the Holy Land. The document that emerges is handed to Baron Rothschild by British foreign secretary Arthur Balfour, and thus becomes known as the Balfour Declaration. * 1923: The League of Nations grants Britain a mandate to oversee and administer Palestine (today’s Israel, West Bank and Gaza).There is a tiny oddity, a devil in the detail, in Michell’s biography, whichclearly indicates that the plan for the Holy Land, which to this day carriesBalfour’s name, was entirely a Secret Society initiative.In The Right Honourable Cecil John Rhodes, Michell quotes this initiativeexactly as Rhodes described it in the Confession of Faith: ‘the occupation byBritish settlers of the entire Continent of Africa, the Holy Land, the Valley ofthe Euphrates …’ Michell goes on to summarise Rhodes’s words thus: ‘In onecomprehensive sentence the world was reconstituted … all Africa annexed, Chinaand Japan regulated to the position of Dependences, the Isles of the Pacificcolonised, the Holy Land secured for the Zionists …’ [emphases mine].The amendments are significant. In his 1877 Confession, Rhodes was mooting theoccupation of the Holy Land by British settlers. Michell’s biography – publishedyears later, in 1910, with Michell being a Secret Society founder member,Rhodes’s banker, and with a seat on the Rhodes Trust chaired by Milner – hasZionists replacing British settlers. Yet the Balfour Declaration, which proposesa homeland for Zionists, was not published until 1917, the British mandate notgranted until 1923, and the fact that Milner and Amery had actually written theBalfour Declaration not revealed until 1937. This leaves little doubt that theSociety had been working on the Confession of Faith plan to settle the Holy Landthroughout the first decade of the twentieth century, and Jewish – or ratherRothschild – influence had caused the shift from British to Zionist settlers.Here is clear evidence that the Secret Society not only evolved and moved toEngland, where it operated for at least another twenty years, but also operatedat a high level of influence.When Milner was approached in 1917 to rescue the government from a disastrouswar, he immediately asked foreign secretary Arthur Balfour to push the planforward. This confirms suggestions that Balfour, if not an actual member of it,was extremely close to the Secret Society. It has, moreover, been revealed thatthe man who in 1937 disclosed1 [part0037.html#ch5fn-1] that the declaration hadbeen written by Milner was W. Ormsby-Gore, an active member of the evolvedSociety then led by Amery.Small wonder that the Secret Society has remained so secret, and that successiveBritish administrations have denied not only its existence and control of thegovernment during the last years of the Great War, but also its influence upuntil the Second World War. However, what is even more disconcerting is thatmany of the ‘day dreams’ in the Confession actually came to fruition. Palestinebecame part of the Empire for a while, Egypt was occupied by British troopsuntil 1922, and the map of Africa was painted red from the Cape almost as far asCairo.It is astonishing that Rhodes ever imagined that the visions in his Confession –so outlandish, so risible in their naiveté – might one day become reality. Theconsensus view is that Rhodes became a law unto himself. Each outrageous move –achieving control of the world’s diamond market, for example – led on to an evenmore preposterous act, so that he eventually allowed an entire country to benamed after himself.2 [part0037.html#ch5fn-2] Naturally secretive, he surroundedhimself with followers who, from his mid-twenties, had labelled him a visionary.These he then bound to himself in a secret bond, and cut them off instantly themoment they betrayed his loyalty. W.T. Stead suffered this fate: his one-timepowerful lieutenant, Stead was guilty of a single lapse, and was instantly out.Rhodes came to believe he could ‘square’ anyone he chose, the classic case beingBarney Barnato, who was the first of the mega-rich to recognise and be swayed byRhodes’s ‘vision’. Nathan Rothschild was also seduced; chequebook always at theready, he never wavered in his support for Rhodes. His reward, as we have seen,was a homeland for the Zionists.Even closer to Rhodes was an inner circle of ‘idealists’ who shared his dreamsof Empire but, until Rhodes came along, had neither the money nor the courage torealise them. Chief among these was Alfred Milner, who had the intellect andadministrative competence to turn it into a working reality. Recognising this,Rhodes left Milner everything bar some small legacies. Important military menlike Lord Kitchener and General Jan Smuts helped facilitate Rhodes’s dreams, aswould leading politicians like David Lloyd George and – in a more distant future– Bill Clinton. There were certain women too who flitted in and out of thecircle, with whom we will reacquaint ourselves in the chapters ahead.* * *Rhodes’s prime objective was ‘colonisation by British subjects of all landswhere the means of livelihood are attainable by energy, labour and enterprise,and especially the occupation by British settlers of the entire Continent ofAfrica’. Even though my family migrated to Rhodesia almost half a century afterthe death of its founder, the country was at the time very much the originalRhodesia.One cannot help wondering how Rhodes thought he could simply take Africa fromits indigenous inhabitants. The answer is, however, quite simple: in Rhodes’seyes, the Africans did not realise that God had preordained their fate, or thatthey were dealing with a man on a secret mission who had no problem driving thisevangelistic message home with a Maxim machine gun. His chosen land, backed upwith the full mandate of the Empress Queen Victoria, was one of the mostbeautiful in the world. The land was vast and largely empty, peaceful, lush andfertile. Moreover, the Africans didn’t seem to mind too much. The Britishpresence provided them with bicycles, tin pots and pans, as well as medicinedispensed from clinics, and schools with water closets.My own family must surely have seemed like aliens as we travelled through thecontinent, arriving in pole-and-dagga villages, our huge truck wheezing dieselfumes and stuffed with goods which could be bartered, such as Primus stoves,electric torches, parasols, sunglasses, Nivea cream, methylated spirits andanti-malarial prophylactics. We had nothing in common with the smilingvillagers. As a boy of ten, I sensed that they worshipped strange gods, acomplex bestiary of wonder and mystery that seemed to control their livesabsolutely. Ancestors were worshipped like next-door neighbours, everyone seemedto live in fear and trembling of evil spirits, while witch doctors, dressed interrifying masks and cloaks of leopard skin and bird feathers, foretold thefuture by means of bones and through a mist of chicken blood.The more ‘savage’ the people we met along the way, the more ‘innocent’ my fatherinsisted they were, and eventually I came to appreciate his use of the word. Hewarned me that rural Africans were ‘the children of Adam and Eve’, and to methat meant they smiled continually, greeted us in a friendly fashion by cuppingtheir hands in front of their faces as they bobbed up and down – and then stoleeverything in sight. This was simply a matter of cultural difference, my fatherexplained. If you left anything lying around, an African would assume you had nofurther use for it.‘It’s still stealing,’ my mother would say, for she had strong views oninnocence.‘Not one in a thousand of these innocent souls knows how an internal combustionengine works,’ my father would reply, as if in benediction.‘One in a million,’ my mother, ever sceptical, would snort.No African did not want a clinic or an education at the little red-brickschools, I think, and few would have turned up their noses at a Mercedes-Benz.And while colonialism did bring a better life to some, it did not include adultsuffrage.We drove through savannah filled with stupendous herds of game in vast,soon-to-be-promulgated national parks like the Serengeti and Tsavo. In everylittle thatched settlement – most of which looked as if they would blow away inthe next wind, and often did – smiling Africans came out to stare and giggle,ready to wait on us hand and foot. We quickly realised that the people had noidea of the value of money, or indeed the market value of some of their goods.One group offered us a large lump of fresh bush meat (furry tail and all), anostrich egg, and an eagle’s quill filled with at least two ounces of alluvialgold. For these we gave a yard or two of ‘Amerikani’ cloth (denim), and theirgleeful faces told us they felt they had got the better part of the bargain.When we asked where the gold came from, they waved at the river. They were muchmore interested in the durable, tightly woven cloth.The Africans were as curious of us and our gear as we were of them. InMaasailand we were offered cattle on the hoof – their most valuable commodity,and the true currency of the region – in exchange for various bits of the truck.The folding canvas hood was much sought-after as a mobile home; the seats wouldhave got us a couple of cows; and my father’s massive bunch of keys – completewith a small Swiss Army knife that drew especially lustful glances – the entireherd. I traded a Biggles book with pictures of aircraft for a Maasai spear, mymother a lipstick for a huge neck piece made of rare glass beads dating from thetime of the slave trade, and my father finally gave up the Swiss Army knife fora Samburu sword stick with a handle of beaten Arab silver, which I still own.We did not force these trades on the locals; quite the contrary in fact. Tothem, what we offered were sought-after iconic objects, and they frequentlyfought each other off with sticks to get to them first. Eventually it wasdecided we would only produce our ‘goodies’ when we needed fresh food or fruitin exchange.I admired the Turkana Maasai, whose initiation ritual required killing a lionarmed with just a spear and a shield. The Maasai managed to remain independentof the imperialists and clung on to their tribal culture. We discovered that itwas not only regarding the value of money where we differed from the Maasai, butalso our sense of right and wrong. They did not ‘steal’ cattle, they explainedto us, they rescued them. Any Maasai worth his salt believed he had been placedon this earth for the purpose of looking after the world’s cattle – includingthat belonging to other people.I vividly remember the day when two young Maasai in full tribal regalia, armedwith spears, swords and sticks, complete with stretched earlobes and missingfront teeth, sauntered into our camp while we were having lunch. We were by thenused to such behaviour, and they displayed no fear, which was a taboo, in anycase. The two men squatted low, spears and swords at the ready, staring withfascination at our Primus stove, the tin of corned beef my mother was opening,and the fork I had raised to my mouth. ‘Be friendly,’ the district commissionerhad told us. ‘Most of the Maasai you will meet will be herd boys.’‘Would you like some?’ my mother asked, forking corned beef onto a tin plate andhanding it over. One of the moran puffed out his cheeks, sniffed the meat, and,apparently judging it heavily overcooked, slid it onto my plate with anapologetic grin. Then he took the tin plate and fork, secreted it in the foldsof his red cloak, and he and his companion stood up and loped off.‘Well, I never,’ said my mother.‘You did give it to him,’ my father pointed out. ‘We have to learn to thinkdifferently out here.’It was 1947 when we eventually arrived in Rhodes’s promised land. Once there, wedispensed largesse to the locals, liberal with our ‘trade goods’. Woodbinecigarettes and matches (awesome magic) were dispensed by the dozen. Today thereis a town in Botswana called Woodbine. Nothing was wasted. Broken cutlery, emptybaked-bean tins, corks and beer bottles all found happy owners. We aliens didnot, of course, speak Shona. We spoke English – Rhodes’s winning ticket in thelottery of life.* * *One of the fallacies about Cecil Rhodes is that he was a lifelong racist whoexploited Africans. While it is true he believed most Africans were at aninferior stage of evolution, there is no evidence that he subscribed to the viewthat they were mentally incapable of ever improving their status, as we shalllater see. Rhodes’s Rhodesia could well have become the ‘great big melting pot,big enough to take the world and all it’s got’, as Blue Mink so hopefully sangin the 1970s. Sadly, though, the country failed to fulfil its promise. Rhodesiawas essentially consumed by the avarice of its white settlers – ironically, thevery instrument that Rhodes believed would justify his imperial ambitions.As a young journalist, I accompanied Rhodesia’s last white prime minister, IanSmith, to London, where I witnessed the ending of Rhodes’s dream. At theceremony, Smith referred to the Confession of Faith – that a united Empire wouldprevent future wars – when he reminded the colonial secretary, Arthur Bottomley,that Britain had only managed to win its wars with the aid of Commonwealthtroops, including many Rhodesians. Smith himself had been one of the famed ‘Few’of the Battle of Britain, and Rhodesia provided a major Royal Air Force trainingbase during the war. An Empire that fought together, said Smith, should sticktogether and look after its own, and not hand its colonies over to thecommunists. Arthur Bottomley was clearly unimpressed, and Smith declaredRhodesia ‘unilaterally independent’3 [part0037.html#ch5fn-3] of what was by thenleft of the British Empire. He would continue to thumb his nose at Britain forthe next seventeen years.Almost a century before, and using a similar tactic, though more successfully,Rhodes used the German ‘menace’ and the need for the Empire to stand againstGermany in his plea to Queen Victoria for a royal charter allowing him to occupyand control the land that eventually became Rhodesia. The Germans were, heclaimed, intending to block the Empire’s advance northwards via militaryententes with the anti-British Boer republics.The occupation of Mashonaland and Matabeleland was a classic example of Rhodes’sdeviousness. He negotiated safe passage through Matabeleland for two of his mostrespected brokers, John Rudd and Robert Moffat – the respected founder of theAnglican mission in Kuruman, Bechuanaland, where David Livingstone had begun hiswork as a missionary. Much controversy surrounds the deal involving Lobengula,but Mashonaland itself was something of a vassal state, despite the tenure ofthe recently arrived Matabele being partial and transitory, as they frequentlysent war parties to raid for slaves, steal food and extract tribute. Rhodesopenly proclaimed that his new Charter Company would free the Shona fromMatabele oppression, a promise he kept in that he moderated the Matabele raids,sending settler cavalry commandos against their warriors, and putting down theMatabele when they staged two rebellions.But here again Rhodes’s true interest in Mashonaland was a secret. He and hisnew acquaintances, the Rothschilds, as well as other rich Britons, now either‘friends’ or members of the Secret Society, were in search of something moremagical and mysterious. Like Rhodes, they believed Mashonaland was the lostbiblical land of Ophir, where King Solomon’s gold would be found.* * *British occupation lasted almost a century, until 1960, when British primeminister Harold Macmillan toured Africa, disliked what he saw, and made a speechin Cape Town: ‘The wind of change is blowing through this continent, and whetherwe like it or not, this growth of national consciousness is a political fact. Wemust all accept it as a fact, and our national policies must take account ofit.’4 [part0037.html#ch5fn-4] He went on to state with real prescience that thegreatest issue for the twentieth century would be whether newly independentcountries in Africa became politically aligned with the West or with communiststates such as Russia and China. In effect, which side of the Cold War wouldindependent Africa support? That decision had already been made in Rhodesia(helped along by Ian Smith’s intransigence), and had also been made in SouthAfrica, which opted for apartheid and international isolation. Both countriesbecame pariah states. Yet miraculously, in South Africa some three decadeslater, an apartheid-era Afrikaner, F.W. de Klerk, and an African nationalist,Nelson Mandela, found common cause and shared the Nobel Peace Prize for pullingtheir country back from the brink of a bloody abyss. Rhodesia-Zimbabwe gotRobert Mugabe.* * *Rhodes might well have approved of the rapprochement in South Africa. There is alittle-known speech of his, quoted by Lewis Michell at the time of the Boer War,where he claims the war had not been against ‘the Dutch’ but rather againstintransigent ‘Krugerism’. Though the Dutch of the Cape (wealthy landowners whoheld the political majority) were of the same stock as the Voortrekkers who hadset up the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, they were in fact ‘a raceapart’, or so Rhodes thought. He had always enjoyed an excellent relationshipwith them under their leader, Jan Hofmeyr, who was sympathetic at least to aSouth African federation.Under the presidency of Paul Kruger, who in Rhodes’s mind was a puritanicalilliterate, the Boer republics would never join his British-led Empirefederation. They were a roadblock on the northwards advance of Empire.Nevertheless, one can see in retrospect that the Boer republics were doomed fromtheir inception, their fate sealed in Rhodes’s Confession of Faith. Still,Rhodes had learnt diplomacy and he began to take the advice of Marcus Aureliusin that little book of aphorisms he carried wherever he went. He and Milner hadto adjust the plan outlined in the Confession, for changes were beginning tostir, threatening the inevitable advance of Empire.The Indian Mutiny, for example, had occurred in 1857 and was followed in 1885 bythe formation of the Indian National Congress. Few people put Mahatma Gandhi inthe same time frame and location as Cecil Rhodes, but Gandhi arrived in SouthAfrica in 1893 as a young lawyer of twenty-four when Rhodes was in his earlyforties and at the height of his power. Rhodes must have seen the writing on thewall. At about this time he wrote a letter to Stead wistfully reaffirming hisbelief in the Empire though expressing doubts as to whether Britain was still upto it. ‘I desire to act for the benefit of those who, I think, are the greatestpeople the world has ever seen, but whose fault is that they do not know theirown strength and their greatness and their destiny.’Rhodes kept at it, however, and was already at work on one of his more ambitiousschemes: a federation made up of the whole of Africa under a British flag. ThisCape-to-Cairo dream is the one by which Rhodes is most remembered, and it wouldbe achieved by building a railway from one end of the continent to the other. Hehad already made a start on this: ‘Every one supposes that the railway is beingbuilt with the only object that a human being may be able to get in at Cairo andget out at Cape Town. This is, of course, ridiculous. The object is to cutAfrica through its centre, and the railway will pick up trade all the way alongits route.’ Pragmatism was creeping in, with the focus shifting to trade.On 15 November 1947, my family and I drove across a unique railway bridge whichturned out to be the last monument to Rhodes’s dream – the magnificentsuspension bridge spanning the Zambezi River at the Victoria Falls which linkedNorthern Rhodesia (Zambia) to Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe). So excited was mymother to be ‘getting back to a bit of civilisation’, she insisted we drivethrough the night to the capital of Southern Rhodesia, Salisbury, through anelectrical storm. With huge bolts of lightning splitting the black sky and astrange orange sun rising between the storm clouds, our journey ended in frontof Meikles Hotel, a multi-storeyed confection of Victorian wrought-ironbalconies and balustrades which utterly delighted my mother but rather alarmedmy father because by then we were broke.* * *Rhodes himself had been broke many decades before my family’s arrival inRhodesia: his failure to complete his 1874–75 study term at Oxford was, saysMichell, ‘probably for want of means’ but may have been due to businessdifficulties requiring his presence in Africa. The Kimberley to which Rhodesreturned in 1874 was as awful as ever. His claims were on the De Beers land,which was a hole about a hundred feet deep, stretching across some ninety acres.Small-sized claims were generally worked by cutting straight down, usingmakeshift ladders and with buckets suspended on a variety of deadly liftingsystems. The odds on dying or finding a worthwhile diamond were more or lessequal. However, once exposed to rain and winds, the walls of the hole began tocrumble. Those who had cut straight down experienced catastrophic slippages andlandslides. When the rainy season arrived, the soil turned to mud, with acridyellow lakes forming which were difficult to pump dry.Most of the claims were one-man operations where the white miner sorted thespoil produced by a couple of native diggers. By now, Herbert had given up onthe place altogether, becoming involved in a variety of get-rich-quickactivities, including running a frontier bar, elephant-hunting andgold-prospecting ever further afield.The cost of digging rose exponentially as the hole got deeper. Later that yearthe Cape government relieved the situation somewhat by lifting the cap on thenumber of claims that could be owned by an individual. Rhodes and Rudd, togetherwith two partners, Grey and Graham, immediately bought up much of Baxter’s Gullyin De Beers mine. In his cricket flannels, battered jacket and an even morebattered hat, no one could have imagined that Rhodes would become a visionarywith the Midas touch. But the new mining law made the accumulation of a realfortune possible, and by 1876, when Rhodes went back to Oxford, he was clearlyon his way. Once there, he vanished for a while, and was in fact so unimpressiveduring these Oxford years that this is precisely the word many of his friendsand mentors used to describe him. Typical is the comment by the Reverend ArthurGray Butler, Dean of Oriel from 1875 to 1895, who is remembered as Rhodes’schief friend at Oxford:His career at Oxford was uneventful. He belonged to a set of men like himself,not caring for distinction in the schools and not working for them … Such a setis not very common at Oxford, living as it does a good deal apart from bothgames and work; but it does exist, and somehow includes men of much intellectualpower which bears fruit later.For all its ambiguity, the description suggests nothing of the budding youngintellectual, nor of the prodigy that lurked inside this Oxford playboy – theRhodes who had read and re-read the million and a half words of Gibbon’s Declineand Fall of the Roman Empire before he was twenty.Rotberg suspects that Rhodes went to Oxford solely for the company and onaccount of its reputation, which Catto confirms was quite common at the time.There were men who went to Oxford to enjoy the university life, the clubs, thedebates and the sport, while others – like Alfred Milner – went there to furthertheir careers, often as academics. Students generally knew from the start whichof these two courses they would be opting for, as did the colleges and the dons.Once there, Rhodes surrounded himself with a band of brothers. ‘It was to themhe was bonded,’ says Rotberg. The time was ripe for Rhodes’s latenthomosexuality to emerge. From Oriel, Rhodes wrote to a friend: ‘I hope you won’tget married. I hate people getting married, they simply become machines and haveno ideas beyond their respective spouses and offspring.’Later on, marriage would become synonymous with disloyalty, and was guaranteedto throw Rhodes into a tantrum. Men in his service who announced their intentionof marrying, especially young men, he often let go. This applied especially tothose he employed as secretaries, and who were referred to as Rhodes’s ‘angels’.Most of his closest associates, among them Leander Starr Jameson and CharlesMetcalfe, either never married or married late in life to secure their estates.Alfred Milner, executor and trustee of Rhodes’s last will, first married at theage of sixty-seven. His bride was a widow, Lady Violet Georgina Gascoyne-Cecil,whose deceased husband, Edward Cecil, had been a senior figure in the evolvedSecret Society.Others at Oxford damned Rhodes with faint praise – or worse. Professor A.V.Dicey, a prominent law don, described Rhodes as a student: ‘Oxford has apeculiar art of putting a stamp of her own upon her pupils, but of this stamp inRhodes, I, personally, could never discover any trace whatsoever.’ All of thebiographers, bar Rotberg, have largely ignored his Oxford years, claiming theycontain little of interest. But perhaps they simply do not fit the stereotype ofthe heroic Rhodes, the Colossus. In fact, in his first eighteen months atOxford, Rhodes was engaged in what was arguably his most significant albeitsecret work, the Confession of Faith, which was in a very real sense his life’swork. His exchange with General Warren on their Kimberley journey in September1877 testifies to its importance in Rhodes’s life at the time.A dubious ‘heart attack’ in 1877 provided the early biographers with a reasonwhy he chose to write a will at so early an age. A more likely reason, though,was that this will, notarised by a lawyer and rendered secret by clientconfidentiality, would formally affirm Rhodes’s intention to set up a secretsociety and to bind his executors to spend on it whatever fortune he mightaccumulate. The list of benefactors is significant. Rhodes leaves his entirenon-existent fortune to his closest friend in the Kimberley band of brothers,‘Sidney Shippard of the Inner Temple’, a lawyer, and to the colonial secretary,whom he has not met. The document – without any of the usual legacies to familyor siblings, of which there were many – goes straight to the point: ‘To and forthe establishment, promotion and development of, a Secret Society …’Some Oxford contemporaries noted that Rhodes seemed preoccupied. His ‘leadingcharacteristic’ at Oxford was ‘a cynical detachment’, says one, while anotherremarks: ‘Rhodes’s greatness was unperceived … he was reserved about his ownprivate affairs.’ And a college acquaintance who went on to be a cabinetminister was surprised that Rhodes, a rampant imperialist in Kimberley, showedno interest in such matters at Oxford: ‘I do not recollect that there was anyindication of the great strength of character and genius for Empire-building,which made him so remarkable a man afterwards.’ Rhodes was, however, keeping hisreal work out of the public eye, and so these Oxford years are truly formative.It was during this time that Rhodes confirmed his capacity, indeed preference,for keeping secret those ideas he believed in most strongly. ‘If he had notsubsequently become a great man, his Oxford career would have passed intooblivion. Or he would have been dismissed as a playboy.’What reveals itself at Oxford is the chameleon in Rhodes’s nature. On the onehand the almost freakishly studious Rhodes, introspective and brooding, whoeschews those things that are normally of interest to a pubescent boy,preferring to read the aphorisms of Marcus Aurelius. But he also dons a BertieWooster coat of many colours, becoming a posturing fop at the Bullingdon Club,and the master of the college hounds. According to his tutor, Barnes Laurence,Rhodes merely fooled everyone into believing he had ‘only elementary knowledge’of the classics, and that he ‘struggled manfully with Latin and Greek’. Laurenceconfirms that Rhodes was nearly sent down in his first year for lackadaisicalattendance of lectures and absenteeism at the Epsom races. This is the sameRhodes who was secretly writing an outline for a brave new world.Yet that same year – 1875 – his best friend at Oxford, Robert Yerburgh, withwhom he shared digs in an old timbered house in Oriel Lane – recalled Rhodesderiding Yerburgh’s own intention of becoming a writer, rejecting it as ‘mereloafing … every man should have active work to do in his life’.5[part0037.html#ch5fn-5] The Bertie Wooster buffoon would never have deliveredthat advice. Instead, it suggests Rhodes may have already entered some kind ofsecret priesthood by this time and, despite being attired in Oxford bags,boozing at the Bullingdon, and flashing his diamonds, in his own mind he waswearing the robes of general in his own Secret Society."},{"pageContent":"6The Power BrokerAt Oxford, Rhodes had gained the reputation of being not just a wastrel but alsoa fool. Contemporaries report that he carried either a bag or box of diamondsaround with him, on one occasion even spilling them on the floor during alecture. When the lecturer asked what the disturbance was, he was told, ‘It’sonly Rhodes and his diamonds, sir.’ Even Rotberg seems to have been taken in bythis image, asserting that Rhodes ‘seems not to have lived amongst theintellects, the aesthetes, or the adventuring imperialists. His friends were notaristocracy either but pretentious gentry … taking no particular pleasure inanswering larger questions about man’s fate, man’s purpose, or man’s socialresponsibilities.’But the reality of the situation was quite different, for in June 1877 Rhodessent his Confession of Faith – the most serious document he ever wrote, andwhich ironically dealt with all the issues above – to the notary. He hadreturned to Oxford the previous year, in 1876, remaining for three terms, andfor all of 1877 – an extended period, giving him enough time to write atreatise, about which Lewis Michell had the following to say: ‘Compared with theEmpire here formulated, that of Rome seems pale and ineffective, even in itspalmiest days.’ It is inconceivable that Rhodes never discussed or debated plansas ambitious as this, and they strongly suggest the existence of a secretsociety at Oxford. The members of this group can be named with reasonablecertainty, and their relationships with Rhodes will emerge more clearly in thechapters ahead.The members of the group included the following. Robert Yerburgh was a youthfulfriend with whom Rhodes frequently caroused at the Bullingdon. Sidney Shippard,one of the Twelve Apostles from Kimberley, was reading law, and as aninfluential civil servant in colonial South Africa would later help Rhodes inestablishing Rhodesia, as well as becoming executor of his first will and beRhodes’s lifelong political crony. Caesar Hawkins, another apostle, was ateenage friend and intellectual companion who came from Umkomaas, and,conveniently, was nephew of the don who eventually admitted Rhodes to Oxford.James Rochfort Maguire, lawyer and British MP who took a Northern Ireland seatrumoured to have been bought for him by Rhodes, was ever-loyal and a friend forlife. And Charles Metcalfe, the most shadowy of Rhodes’s companions, was also asoulmate.And yet the question remains: who was the real Rhodes? There were indeed severalversions of Rhodes, since he did not simply grow older, but seemed rather toevolve through his lifetime. By the middle of his long university dalliance,another Rhodes had begun to emerge – an enormously successful businessman whorivalled Carnegie, Rockefeller and the Astors. He acquired a complete monopolyover diamond production in Kimberley, achieved by means of calculated gambles,bribes, ‘claim-jumping’ and enforcement conducted by gangs of club-wieldingthugs. His shady speculations, his misrepresentation of his assets and generalfinancial chicanery have been the subject of several books. To that should beadded gunrunning, money-laundering, as well as ‘consolidations’, ‘amalgamations’and other monopolistic practices of the type that resulted in the Americanlegislature passing the first of today’s antitrust laws. By the time Rhodesreturned to Kimberley in 1874, he had already stopped playing the fool. Theviolent, unstable community of diamond diggers, diamond buyers, traders, saloonkeepers, whores and general riff-raff based around the burgeoning town had grownto the point where it had become the second-largest human agglomerate in SouthAfrica.Home for Rhodes was now a slum on the verge of anarchy, crammed around the edgeof an ever-deepening and dangerous hole where every foot of ground was worth aking’s ransom, not an inch of which was conceded without an argument or fight.Rhodes loved the place! The population comprised Englishmen and Afrikanersforever at odds with one another, shiftless adventurers from every Australianand American mining rush, at least one other secret organisation (the MollyMalones, descended from a weird Irish sect that wore widow’s weeds anddeath’s-head make-up), ‘old’ money like that of the Rothschilds and the Barings,and ‘new’ money typified by the irrepressible Barney Barnato. This scum-filledwater did not seem to bother this Rhodes, who was as buoyant as a cork.Once back in Kimberley, he dumped his ‘toff’ persona and went back to living inrough conditions, with few creature comforts apart from liquor and cigarettes.Yet Rhodes was far from being ‘on his beam ends’, as several biographers haveasserted. At the end of 1873, for example, he bought ten new houses in WestHampstead for a total of £6,200, £4,400 of which was a mortgage, though with areturn of £600 a year. This annual income amounted to a small fortune at thetime, especially for a young man of twenty-one who was penniless the yearbefore. Yet his wealthy Aunt Sophy, ever willing to subsidise her nephew’seducation, paid his fees when Rhodes had a second spell at Oxford in 1876.A letter that Rhodes wrote to Rudd presents a gleam of optimism in the generaleconomic gloom on his return to Kimberley in 1874: ‘You will be in the thick ofbad times now, but do not funk. The application of machinery to diamonds willlick depreciation in prices. Diamonds are worn as much and more than ever, onlythis year people are so poor that half of London is unlet. There is simply noSeason.’ Still, caution prevails in his urgings to Rudd: ‘We should knock alongwith what we have got. We have a sufficient block [of claims] to make a fortuneif diamonds last, and have enough property in Kimberley. If we make more money Iwould sooner say lend it or go in for a nest egg here at home.’And that is exactly what they did. For the next five years, until 1879, Rhodes,under Rudd’s steadying hand, worked away at meeting the right people andconsolidating his company. Men like the reclusive Jewish diamond buyer AlfredBeit and the secretive proconsul Alfred Milner, who would cold-bloodedly shapethe political future of South Africa, eventually came under his thrall.Throughout these years Rudd and Rhodes were little known, certainly no more thanother entrepreneurs. Yet Rhodes was unusually astute, as indicated by hisstatement: ‘the application of machinery to diamonds will lick depreciation inprices’.However, in 1875–76, the ground, quite literally, shifted under their feet. Theyellowish topsoil of the De Beers farm gave way to blue ground, the deepsubstratum which would continue to produce rich diamondiferous ore until themine eventually closed. Most diggers regarded this substratum as a disaster, andthe industry all but collapsed. It was harder, and therefore more difficult todig. When it was dug up, the softer soil above was destabilised, collapsinginwards. In addition, there was serious flooding as the mines got deeper. AsRhodes had forecast, machines were required to keep the industry going, and heand Rudd were among the first to bring in pumping equipment.The 1876 declaration by the British at the Cape had ended restrictions onbusiness dealings at the Big Hole. All bars on capital deployment wereeliminated, claims were allowed to be consolidated, and companies to beamalgamated. What followed was a takeover war in which no holds were barred.Rhodes’s financial gambles paralleled practices in America where vast fortuneswere being made. American financial trusts resulted in massive, secretivemonopolies which could be used to control prices of goods, services and stockmarket trading. Consequently, because they were regarded as a threat to thepublic good, the Sherman Antitrust Act was passed in 1890 to control monopoliesand promote competition.In contrast, Kimberley was a free-for-all. Nevertheless, the removal ofrestrictions did have the effect of lifting diamond mining out of the recession– and eventually giving control of the industry to Rhodes. This was the Gamethat Rhodes so loved to play, a battle royal in which he decimated hiscompetitors. The ten-acre De Beers mine saw Rhodes and Rudd competing withGraham and Grey to buy up Baxter’s Gully. George W. Compton gained control ofthe adjoining Poor Man’s Gully against competition from Frederick S. PhilipsonStow and Robert English. Another war was being fought over the Kimberley mine bythe famous English banker, Francis Baring-Gould, operating as the CentralCompany. A cartel comprising Isaac and Barnet Lewis and Samuel Marks was knownas ‘the French Company’ – Compagnie Française des Mines de Diamants du Cap duBon Espérance – and an up-and-coming London East Ender, Barnett Isaacs, known asBarney Barnato, was readying himself for a joust with Rhodes.The competition intensified when it was realised that the blue ground was infact the real bonanza. De Beers proved to be an ancient crater, and the ‘blue’was not bedrock but solidified mud that broke down when exposed to the weather,containing at least as many diamonds as the yellow clay. Rhodes was among thefirst to gamble on the possibility that the blue ground and its pipes ofdiamonds went very deep. He persuaded Rudd to buy up diggers’ claims – givingrise to rumours of coercion – as well as claims held by banks in lieu of debtrepayments. Rudd dug into the profits from their pumping business and theice-cream monopoly to make these purchases. By 1878 they owned forty claims.Rudd hedged the still dicey diamond investments by setting up a hardwarebusiness and a liquor outlet. Even so, by the late 1870s, neither man was aswealthy as Baring-Gould, Frederick Stow or Barney Barnato.Onto the stage now steps Alfred Beit, who will devote his life and the enormousfortune he made in his own right to everything Rhodes believed in. Beit would goon to found the British South Africa Company (BSAC), the chartered company thatenabled Rhodes to colonise Mashonaland. Soon another millionaire-in-the-making,the little-known locally born ‘Abe’ Bailey – who through astute gold investmentsaccumulated a huge fortune, political contacts, and eventually an Englishbaronetcy – also appears in the wings. Bailey would support Rhodes in many ofhis ventures, including the Jameson Raid. Some idea of the future influence ofthese moguls may be gleaned from the fact that Bailey was a close friend ofWinston Churchill from the time the latter was a war correspondent in SouthAfrica. Indeed, Bailey’s son, who became the Second Baronet, Sir William MilnerBailey went on to marry Churchill’s daughter, Diana. Churchill himself neverbothered to hide his admiration for Rhodes’s imperialism, and when Rhodesiaapplied for self-rule some thirty years later, the most influential of theBritish aristocrats who supported the idea was the First Lord of the Admiralty,Winston Churchill.* * *In my own life, Winston Churchill has featured almost as large as Cecil Rhodes.His name crops up in this story as regularly as the beat of a metronome,starting in 1947. It was then that my family happily settled down in Salisbury,in our own prefabricated house, to settler life – in the manner Rhodes hadadvocated in his Confession of Faith. My father Len had a job on the SalisburyCouncil, which ensured we remained poor as church mice in English terms, butlived high off the Rhodesian hog. He and my mother Edith (who both worked fromthe day we arrived almost to the day of their deaths) could not afford placesfor me or my brother Peter at any of the grand Salisbury schools like St Georgesor Prince Edward, so I enrolled instead as a Founder boy at the more prosaicSalisbury East Boys High School. Thanks to Winston Churchill, however, it didnot remain so.Salisbury East inherited from Prince Edward School the legendary ‘Jeeves’Hougaard, an Afrikaner intellectual who was determined that his new school wouldbecome more British even than Eton and Harrow. At the same time, he taught us toappreciate the poetry of Eugène Marais, even writing our Afrikaans textbook. Anyempathy I have for the Afrikaner and his language is due entirely to JeevesHougaard.Our masters all wore mortarboards and academic gowns over their suits and tieseven though the temperatures in our concrete blockhouse of a school regularlyexceeded 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Time was taken off from classes to createplaying fields that rivalled those of Eton. In full school uniform, we wouldmarch in the hot sun, picking up rocks from the black loamy soil. Discipline wasmaintained in typical English public-school manner – by flogging. Hougaardhimself once flogged me for wearing my school hat at too jaunty an angle.But to return to Churchill: my father had decided to emigrate when WinstonChurchill, having won the war, was defeated in the 1945 UK election. How couldany nation be so ungrateful? So convinced were my parents that Labour’s victorywas the equivalent of the Bolshevik Revolution that, not long afterwards, wepacked our bags and left for Rhodesia, a place where civilised standards stillprevailed – and one, moreover, that wasn’t having anything to do withBolshevism.Imagine my parents’ delight when, in 1950, Mr Hougaard announced that he hadbeen in secret negotiations with Winston Churchill, reminding the old war horsehow many Rhodesians had died with the Few in the Battle of Britain.Consequently, the school was renamed Churchill High School, and pupils woreexpensive purple blazers made in England, sporting the Marlborough crest of theChurchill family. Our school houses were renamed after Battle of Britain heroes.When Churchill was re-elected in 1951 at the end of my first school year, therewas much applause. Somewhat ironically, some twenty years later, one of the Few,Ian Smith, became prime minister – an event that would hasten my departure fromRhodesia as an undesirable liberal.I went to see my old school in 2013, checking up on what was left of Rhodes’sdream. It is still possible to travel on his railway from the Cape to VictoriaFalls via Kimberley, and when I arrived in Salisbury I was pleased to see thatthe school appeared well maintained. However, it was impossible to make mypresence known as BBC personnel are banned in Zimbabwe, and the only way I couldtravel was incognito.* * *Rhodes first met Alfred Beit in 1875, and Beit, who was least known of hispartners, was arguably the most important. Lewis Michell describes this meeting:In 1875 there came to Kimberley from Hamburg, as a diamond buyer, a youth of thesame age as Rhodes, of the name of Alfred Beit. Born of a wealthy and honourablefamily, and possessing in abundance all those qualities which make for successin life, he was gradually drawn into close, and ever closer, relations withRhodes. For many years before their death – for the one did not long survive theother – it is not too much to say that they were the complement to each other.Beit became a Rhodes Trustee, controlling this enormous fortune after Rhodes’sdeath. Like Rhodes, he chose not to marry: ‘I never,’ Beit wrote of marriage,‘ever felt the least inclined in that way.’In 1878, Leander Starr Jameson joined this new band of brothers. Born the sameyear as Rhodes, the unmarried Jameson would serve as Rhodes’s doctor, hisgeneralissimo in Rhodesia and his successor as prime minister of the CapeColony. He was also Rhodes’s most intimate friend – the man in whose arms Rhodeseventually died. Alongside Alfred Beit, Jameson joined the Rhodes Trustees. Helater noted of this lifelong friendship with Rhodes:We were young men together then and saw a great deal of each other. We shared aquiet bachelor establishment, walked and rode together, shared our meals,exchanged our views on men and things, and discussed his big schemes which eventhen filled me with admiration. I soon admitted to myself that for sheer naturalpower I had never met a man to come near Cecil Rhodes.1 [part0037.html#ch6fn-1]Writing just four years before Rhodes died, Jameson unwittingly provides animportant clue to Rhodes’s lifelong commitment to his Secret Society:He used to talk over all his plans and schemes with me and, looking back at themnow, it surprises me to note what little change there is in his policy. He had,for instance, even at that early date, formed the idea of doing a great work forthe over-crowded British public by opening up fresh markets for theirmanufactures. He was deeply impressed with a belief in the ultimate destiny ofthe Anglo-Saxon race. This purpose of occupying the interior and ultimatelyfederating South Africa was always before his eyes.Notably, there is no reference to anything clandestine, even though by this timeRhodes was the general of the Secret Society, and had been involved with Steadin re-establishing the Society in England as The Society of Friends, whichbecame a formidable cadre of leading British aristocrats, bankers and diplomats.In 1876, however, Rhodes was still at Oxford pursuing a worthless degree and, toall appearances, living a wastrel existence. The by-now gigantic Kimberley holehad been annexed by the British, and the area named Griqualand West. Supposedlyadministered as a Crown Colony, in reality there was barely any officialcontrol. The Boers in the neighbouring republics bitterly resented the continualinflux of Uitlanders who had effectively stolen their rich diamond fields.Meanwhile in the Transvaal the government had all but collapsed, with Boerfarmers deciding that so few services were being delivered that they refused topay taxes. Various African groups sensed an opportunity, and a number ofpowerful tribes, including the Zulu, Basuto, Pondo and Gaika, began testing thestrength of their white neighbours. Germany also scented opportunity in theanti-British feelings festering in the Boer republics. The new GermanChancellor, Otto von Bismarck, had a plan to establish two large Germancolonies, and he initiated talks with the Boer president, Paul Kruger, aboutforming defensive alliances with the Boer republics.The Boers themselves had their own expansion plans. The mission stationestablished by German missionary Alexander Marensky was strategically locatednorth of the Vaal River, and performed a useful monitoring function. Marenskywas not alone in this, as many other missionaries played the Great Game in theinterests of their mother countries. John Moffat at the Kuruman mission inBechuanaland spied on the Matabele for Britain, and would later endorse Rudd’s‘concession’ offer to Lobengula.Many German nationals exploring the wealth and military potential of thehinterland were assisted by Pastor Marensky. One such was the explorer-geologistKarl Mauch, who was briefed by Marensky on reports of a ‘lost city’ rich intreasure in Mashonaland. Rhodes soon learnt of these reports, sending his ownspy north – a Dutch elephant hunter, Willie Posselt. When the Dutchman returnedwith a startling artefact – a bird carved from stone, resembling those found inEgyptian temples – Rhodes embarked with determination on a scheme to find Ophir,the fabled city of gold and precious stones.In 1877 the British government through its Cape-based high commission sent alarge police contingent to the failing Transvaal, justifying its actions bysuggesting that the financially weak republic had become ungovernable. AnthonyTrollope, who may well have been dabbling in the Great Game himself, wrote insupport of the British action: ‘My conviction is that had not the Englishinterfered, European supremacy throughout a large portion of South Africa wouldhave been endangered. I think the annexation was an imperative duty.’Boer leaders saw the intervention as piracy and summoned dour, intransigent PaulKruger to lead their resistance. The reaction of the ‘back-veldt Boers’ was oneof general sullenness: powerless because of the weakness of their government,‘Israel retired to its tents and sulked,’ says Michell.Why Rhodes was so sanguine during this period of extreme economic and politicalflux remains unexplained. He does, however, seem to have been enormouslyoccupied with the band of brothers. They had by now become acolytes, and many oftheir reminiscences reveal that Rhodes was widely regarded as a visionary. Allthe while, his enlarged diamond holdings steadily grew, increasing his fortune.During the difficult years of 1876–80, he and Rudd built fortunes calculated –on paper at least – to be worth some £50,000 apiece, though they still had to becareful with their cash flow. Rhodes’s brother Frank loaned him £100, and AuntSophy covered debts in England to the tune of £400. On becoming secretary of thenew De Beers company, one of the first things Rhodes did was to pay himself anadvance on his salary – all of £5.It is a truism of recessions, then as now, that successful entrepreneurs sensetheir retreat long before their competitors do, and this was certainly true ofRhodes. For in Cape Town the economy was already on the move. The first mountainreservoir was built to supply fresh water to the growing city, the docks wereupgraded to handle large ships carrying troops, provisions and armaments forfrontier wars, and the Parliament building was commissioned. By now, Rhodes hadalso started to take on public responsibilities. Together with other volunteershe joined the Diamond Fields Horse under the command of young General Warren. Somuch for his ‘dicky heart’ and ‘consumptive’ lungs!The regiment had been formed by Warren to suppress native insurgencies that werebreaking out like bush fires on the borders of land occupied by whites. Formedin 1876, it had seen virtually continuous action against the Xhosa-speakinginhabitants of Pondoland, the Gcaleka in Transkei, and the Tswana-speakingThlaping. The skirmishes all stemmed from land disputes. The Thlaping wereprotecting forests which were being carted away by Boers who sold wooden polesto diggers to prop up their diamond mines. Trouble was also brewing inBasutoland.Two regiments of British troops were shipped to Cape Town to put down theseinsurgencies. Rhodes regarded these conflicts as a necessary evil, an inevitablepart of the process of Empire-building. One casualty of the many wars was a Zulutribe, the amaNdebele (known as the Ndebele or Matabele). They had fled acrossthe Limpopo River in the far north, where they were exiled as a result of asuccession war between the Zulu chief, Shaka, and the Ndebele chief, Mzilikazi.The notoriously warlike Matabele treated the Shona to the north of them asvassals. Significantly, Rhodes had developed a special interest in Mashonaland,where he was convinced Ophir and its fabulous wealth would be found.As a rough-rider with the Diamond Fields Horse, Rhodes’s growing contact withthe troublesome native tribes made him realise that a political solution wouldneed to be found if his investment in Kimberley was going to be worth anything.So a new persona emerged at a remarkably early age: Rhodes the adept politician.This political Rhodes was influenced at Oxford by John Ruskin, an eccentricpolymath best known for his support of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and theArts and Crafts movement. His inaugural lecture at Oxford in 1870 may well haveinspired Rhodes’s early thinking in the Confession of Faith. ‘A destiny nowpossible to us,’ Ruskin asserted, ‘is the highest ever set before a nation to beaccepted or refused. Will you youths of England make your country again a royalthrone of kings, a sceptred isle, for all the world a source of light, a centreof peace …?’ In order not to perish, England would need to ‘found colonies asfast and far as she is able, formed of the most energetic and worthiest of men;seizing any piece of fruitful waste ground she can set her foot on, and thereteaching her colonists that their chief virtue is to be fidelity to their owncountry and that their first aim is to be to advance the power of England byland and sea’.Ruskin’s words gave form to Rhodes’s youthful dreams – indeed, certain phrasesare repeated verbatim in the Confession of Faith – and in years to come inspiredthousands of British families – including my own – who turned their eyes to thecolonies. In the 1950s the ‘power of England’ made a last advance in southernAfrica, with the amalgamation of today’s Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi into theCentral African Federation.Apart from these imperial ambitions, Rhodes apparently shared Ruskin’s singularviews on marriage. Ruskin had had his unconsummated marriage annulled, aconsequence of the repulsion he felt for his wife’s body. At Oxford, Rhodesevidently regarded marriage as anathema, for he towed around his ‘ratherprecious’ young friend Robert Yerburgh, who was among the bon vivants at boththe Bullingdon and at Vincent’s Club.2 [part0037.html#ch6fn-2] Oscar Wilde wasat the time also a member of the Bullingdon, as was Rhodes’s new friend, JamesRochfort Maguire. Undoubtedly, another Rhodes persona altogether was emerginghere, and these bon vivant male friends soon became an intimate part of hislife.Yet Oxford was not simply, as some have claimed, nine terms of ‘rest andrecreation’, an escape from the rigours of life on the Kimberley mines. TheEnglish climate did not suit Rhodes, and Oxford winters brought on regular boutsof influenza. As a result, Rhodes never escaped his reputation for frail health,despite undertaking arduous safaris which are recorded as the happiest andhealthiest times of his life. Oxford not only cemented lifelong friendships,such as those with James Maguire and Sidney Shippard, but provided theopportunity of learning social skills essential to a man with aspirations thatwould result in him meeting Queen Victoria, becoming a privy councillor andeventually having an honorary degree conferred on him at Oxford. This educationalso provided access to another type of Oxford man, typified by Milner, there towin an excellent degree, whom Rhodes also needed to fulfil his grand ambitions.Surrounded by like minds, and egged on not only by the fervent nationalism ofRuskin but also by the imperial vision of Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli,Rhodes decided that what the Empire needed was a caste of champions, to whicheminent men like Milner might devote themselves. At about this time, AnthonyTrollope – novelist, polymath and a social reformer of the Ruskin school – wrotethat Africans should be urged ‘out of their unimproved simplicity into fruitfulcontact with the European that is to be found at railway construction works anddiamond diggings’.3 [part0037.html#ch6fn-3]* * *In 1881, having eventually obtained a rather poor Second from Oxford, Rhodesreturned to the Cape to put his larger plan into action, only to find that theslowly boiling pot had finally blown its lid. His imperialist plans had to adaptto a radically changed southern Africa. In 1879 Britain made the disastrousdecision to subdue the most militant tribe, the Zulus. A border raid into Natalby a small group of Zulus provided the excuse, and Lord Chelmsford led his armyinto Zululand, to a hill called Isandlwana. A hospital and a supply depot hadbeen established at nearby Rorke’s Drift.There was no sign of the Zulus, so Chelmsford left half of his army setting upcamp and took the other half off to search for the enemy. When Chelmsford hadbeen allowed to wander for twelve miles across the apparently empty countryside,the Zulu army rose from the deep gullies in which it had concealed itself,formed itself into the legendary ‘Horns of the Buffalo’ attack formation andwiped out almost every soldier at Isandlwana.The British reaction was one of astonishment and affront – no native tribe hadever before decimated a colonial army – although the British did, to a degree,manage to save face at Rorke’s Drift in a heroic stand by a rear-guard of sickBritish soldiers and engineers. A mere 152 men held up to 4,000 Zulus at bay,firing their new Martini-Henry rifles until the barrels glowed in the dark.Fifteen Victoria Crosses, the highest number for any battle in the British Armyuntil then, were awarded that day. The insult to British pride also ensured thata vast expansionist army, commanded by a clutch of major generals, quickly putdown the Zulu nation, sending Chief Cetshwayo into exile.Taking heart from the Zulu victory, the Boers rose up and fought three shortbattles against British troops, winning conclusively at Majuba, where superiorBoer marksmen wiped out the British positioned on top of the hill. These swiftand lethal encounters came to be known as the First Boer War or the TransvaalWar of Independence, and British colonial armies never quite recovered fromthem. So it was that in 1881, at the hastily convened Convention of Pretoria,the Boers managed to regain control of the Transvaal Republic.By now Rhodes had settled down in his shack on the edge of the ever-deepeningKimberley mine, aware that this was no longer a home but a battlefield – andthat the Empire would never be the same again. Moreover, the damage had beendone to the Empire’s invincible reputation by two inferior races in this part ofAfrica. With his Oxford degree under his belt, everyone assumed that Rhodeswould simply finalise the details of his diamond business and then retire toBritain, as other colonial magnates before had done, and indeed as Rudd and Beitdid after Rhodes’s death.But Rhodes chose to do the opposite. The time had come to put some flesh on thebones of his Confession of Faith, and also to flesh out the Secret Society.‘Africa is still lying ready for us, it is our duty to take it … [for] the mosthonourable race in the world.’ And so he stood for the Cape Parliament in theGriqualand constituency of Barkly West. The constituency was, as AnthonyTrollope describes it, ‘a half-deserted wasteland’, the home of a few remainingalluvial diamond diggers and farmers on the Transvaal side of the Vaal River.The majority of voters were rural Boers or their descendants. What could thismove possibly bring to the lives of the voters of Barkly West, or indeed toRhodes’s own life?Few biographers appear to have spotted the fact that Rhodes used his SecretSociety to take over – not merely the ‘half deserted wasteland’, but also two ofthe three Griqualand constituencies. The most important of the three seats wasKimberley, which was, however, being contested by a local worthy, Dr Josiah W.Matthews, a doctor with liberal views who had served as vice-president of theGriqualand West Legislative Council. Young Rhodes could not hope to unseat thisexperienced adversary but, with a stroke of good fortune, a certain Joseph Orpenstood for one of the other seats and won, with Rhodes winning the third seat.Orpen was a founder member of Rhodes’s Secret Society, who, with his brotherFrancis, had in 1876–77 attended the inaugural meeting in the ‘very small tworoomed corrugated iron house with a wooden floor’ in Kimberley where Rhodes hadfirst expounded his imperial dream. Present too was Lewis Michell, who confirmsthat it was an Orpen who proposed that whenever their ‘little committee’corresponded, they should include before their names the secret ‘symbol of fiveon the dice’ – the diamond-shaped symbol that denoted membership of the Pyramidof Brothers.The election victories gave Rhodes a majority position in Griqualand West, whicheffectively meant that the Secret Society had political control of the richestpiece of territory in the whole of southern Africa, with the bonus of a largeslice of the Cape’s income. Moreover, when the ‘Three’ – Rhodes, Orpen andMatthews (the latter had soon seen the way the wind blew, and joined thetriumvirate) – entered the Cape Parliament, they would succeed in bringing downthe government of Sir Gordon Sprigg within weeks.What had brought matters to a head was the ongoing strife in the kingdom ofBasutoland, home of the powerful Sotho tribes. It was this native war thatfinally offered Rhodes a way, via Gordon, to move his Secret Society onto thebig stage in Britain. The Basuto War had been raging for years, and ineptattempts by Cape bureaucrats had all but turned it into a civil war between thenorth and the south. The Cape considered partitioning the kingdom: the south,where loyal tribes had done a deal with the Cape; and the north, where rebelgroups remained active. The Cape then tried to relinquish Basutoland to Britishrule, but that had been turned down, and the war was now out of control, costingthe Cape a fortune. Rhodes had a special interest in this particular war becauseit was seriously impacting on the availability of labour in the Kimberley mines.* * *Now that he was a member of the Cape Parliament, Rhodes made it clear that hewas both an independent and a liberal, telling the house, in his Oxford bags,that he could legislate as well as anyone wearing ‘sable’. During debates, theSpeaker often had to remind him to refer to members by their constituencies andnot by name, a rule he often ignored. Rhodes was a poor speaker, his voicerising to a falsetto when he became excited, and there is no record of himmaking a memorable speech. Nevertheless, he managed very successfully to get hismessage across.In the 1870s the Cape government had taken control of the kingdom of Basutolandin the hope of establishing a reliable source of labour. It was with surprisingenthusiasm that Sotho men went off to work in the diamond and gold mines – untilthe reason became apparent. They were arming themselves, spending their earningson guns. Some ten years later, just before Rhodes went into Parliament in 1880,the Cape legislature took action, deciding to extend the Peace Preservation Actof 1878 to Basutoland, and to disarm its citizens. This alone was enough toexpand the conflict into a guerrilla war stretching into the territory’snorthern mountains. But Sprigg exacerbated the situation by telling the Sothochiefs that if they continued their rebellion their taxes would be raised andwhites would be permitted to settle on the troublesome lands.Rhodes and his cohorts condemned the Act, claiming it could kill the diamondindustry; in his maiden speech, made twelve days after entering Parliament,Rhodes took a surprisingly pro-African line: ‘We sold them the guns, they boughtthem out of hard-earned wages, and it is hard lines to make them give them upagain.’ And he derided the Cape’s ability to enforce the ban. The Cape, hereminded Parliament, had a white population no larger than ‘a third-rate Englishcity’. Seated right behind him was Orpen, stressing how dangerous it would be toinsist on total disarmament at a time of widespread tension. Matthews took asimilar line. The first vote went Sprigg’s way, but ten days later Rhodes, Orpenand Matthews swung their votes behind an amendment – and Sprigg was toppled asprime minister.In a dramatic volte-face, Rhodes, who had previously supported racistlegislation – including an Act permitting employers to flog natives caughtstealing diamonds – had changed his colours once again. From this time on, andthough he was often condemned for his views, Rhodes enjoyed the reputation ofliberal problem-solver in the troubled area of ‘native affairs’.Arguably, even more significant than this ‘liberalism’ was his friendship withJan Hendrik Hofmeyr, whom he later described as ‘without doubt the mostcompetent politician in South Africa’. Here again, the chameleon was changingits colour, as most ‘English’ South Africans rarely had intimate friendshipswith Afrikaners. This friendship was, admittedly, sweetened by the fact thatHofmeyr was editor of the prominent newspaper De Zuid Afrikaan; he was,moreover, destined to lead the Afrikander Bond, a political party that sought toprotect the interests of Dutch farmers in the colony.Southern Africa was at this time a tapestry comprising many different strands.The English governed in the Cape, though with the support of Britain’s politicaland military might. Dutch families like the Van der Byls, Melks and Van derStels were in the majority in the colony, and their rural descendants, theBoers, ruled over the republics to the north. Then of course there wereimmigrant groups, including the descendants of slaves who generally spoke a Capepatois that eventually became the Afrikaans language. Apart from the colouredpopulation, there were at the time three main African groups: the originalinhabitants, the San-Bushmen-Khoikhoi; migrants from the north who includedNguni tribes such as the Zulu and the Xhosa, as well as the Sotho and theTswana; and then there were the mixed-race Griquas.Rhodes’s friendship with Hofmeyr was perceived by many as a betrayal of hisclass, his nation, and the English at the Cape. And when the friendshipstrengthened and blossomed into what the novelist and biographer Sarah GertrudeMillin describes as ‘[s]omething more than a political alliance with the Dutchleader’, it alienated many an English supporter in the Cape Parliament. ButRhodes knew very well what he was doing, even if he only shared that knowledgewith Orpen. Rhodes was aware that Hofmeyr also wanted a federation, probably toensure that the Dutch of the Cape retained their dominance over their lesssophisticated brothers who were mismanaging their republics in the north.These proved to be the first steps towards ensuring that the entire continentfell under the control of the English-speaking race. In Rhodes’s mind, afederated South Africa would be the first to take its place in an EmpireParliament located in London – just as he had planned in his Confession ofFaith. Saul Solomon, the senior liberal in Parliament, allegedly remarked afterRhodes’s somewhat squeaky maiden speech: ‘Watch that man. He is the future manof South Africa and possibly of the world.’ But this glowing credential shouldperhaps not be taken entirely at face value: working through an intermediary,Rhodes had just bought the leading English newspaper, the Cape Argus, from SaulSolomon himself.At this point, Rhodes was about to meet an especially powerful admirer – one whoreally did help him to influence the course of history. It was in 1881 thatRhodes offered his services to Parliament, negotiating with the Basuto to endtheir rebellion. This brought him into contact with the star of the imperialcircus, General ‘Chinese’ Gordon. The meeting resulted in what was arguably thestrangest love affair in British colonial history. It was love at first sight:the two great men fell for each other, with Gordon inviting Rhodes to become hispartner."},{"pageContent":"7Loves and LoversThe affair between Rhodes and Gordon has been much debated,1[part0037.html#ch7fn-1] but the consensus is that Rhodes fell in love withGordon in what Robert Rotberg describes ‘as the conjunction of two meteors’.Gordon has left accounts2 [part0037.html#ch7fn-2] which leave no doubt that,from the moment he met Rhodes that fateful day in 1881, he was smitten.Moreover, Gordon’s love for boys – and for brandy – is strongly hinted at inLytton Strachey’s biography, Eminent Victorians.3 [part0037.html#ch7fn-3]Homosexuality is a significant theme in this account. As will becomeincreasingly evident, Rhodes’s sexual inclinations determined the company hechose to keep, and had a material effect on his decisions. Certainly itunderpinned his decision to involve himself in a strictly disciplined societylargely made up of gay men, to which he devoted his life and work. While hecontemplated associations with women, and even attempted friendships with some,he generally found women wanting in some way or another, and so had less andless to do with them.Until fairly recently, most biographers have not affirmed – and certainly notconfirmed – that Rhodes was gay. This was not for want of evidence – Rhodessurrounded himself with what were variously dubbed his ‘lambs’ or angels – butrather because of prevailing attitudes. As will become evident later, the effectof Victorian mores on Rhodes’s life was profound. Despite strict libel lawsprotecting people from public exposure, dire consequences awaited any eminentVictorian caught in a homosexual act.Gordon was adept at concealing his sexual passions.4 [part0037.html#ch7fn-4] Hedid not bother to conceal his interest in the occult, however. And like manyVictorians, Rhodes included, Gordon also flirted with the notion ofreincarnation. In 1877, he wrote: ‘I have little doubt of our havingpre-existed; and that also in the time of our pre-existence we were activelyemployed. So, therefore, I believe in our active employment in a future life,and I like the thought.’ In his hereafter there were no loafers – a notionRhodes would certainly have approved of.All this aside, Gordon’s record as an imperial soldier is undeniably remarkable.A hero of the Crimea, General Gordon went on to China when the Emperor wasfacing defeat at the hands of the Taiping rebels and took command of a largepeasant force known as the ‘Ever Victorious Army’. Because of his role inhelping to quell the rebellion, the Emperor made Gordon a Chinese viscount,while the British promoted him to lieutenant general. An adoring public gave himthe nickname ‘Chinese Gordon’. In 1874 he proceeded to Egypt where he served asa colonel in the Egyptian Army. Actively promoting imperialism, he travelledsouth in 1876 where he succeeded the explorer Samuel Baker as governor of a vastterra incognita called Equatoria (Sudan).5 [part0037.html#ch7fn-5] He succeededin establishing a line of way stations from the White Nile to the frontier ofUganda, whence he proposed opening a route to Mombasa. It was almost a racebetween Gordon and Rhodes to make the continent British from Cairo to the Cape,and had Gordon survived the attack on his life in 1885, it is likely that hewould have won. In that sense, the much younger Rhodes could be said to havetaken over where Gordon left off.Throughout the 1870s and 1880s, honours and appointments rained down on Gordon.He was invited by King Leopold II of the Belgians to take charge of the vastCongo Free State, and by the Cape government to take command of their armedforces. He declined both invitations, and for good reason: he had accepted theposition of governor general of the whole of the Sudan – and would soon be knownas Gordon of Khartoum. In the interim, he agreed to go to the Cape, where hewould help settle matters with the Basuto. Gordon was believed to be especiallygifted at this kind of negotiation. In the words of his biographer, Lord Elton:‘He knew that he possessed what some described as mesmeric power over primitivepeoples and what he himself called the faculty of getting under their skins.’6[part0037.html#ch7fn-6] Surprisingly, however, Gordon proved unsuccessful in hisefforts. So the Cape government sent a team of local experts, led bytwenty-seven-year-old Cecil Rhodes and accompanied by Joseph Orpen, to help himout.Rhodes and Orpen arrived in time to hear that Gordon was planning anunaccompanied visit to the fierce Sotho rebel Masopha – thereby giving theimpression that he was the representative of Queen Victoria rather than the CapeParliament. Orpen, a native speaker, was appalled at the news: ‘This will ruineverything,’ he complained to Rhodes. ‘Beside that, Gordon is quiteuncontrollable; he will say exactly what comes uppermost at the time and notwhat you may wish him to say … He seems quite mad sometimes.’ Orpen saw himquite simply as a loose cannon. He ridiculed Gordon’s tactics, his unsuccessfulattempts to get through to Masopha ‘with a display of compassion, mysticism, andsymbolism’. Clearly, the problem was not simply the conflict of policies, butalso a clash of personalities. The Cape authorities, who had by now had theirfill of Masopha, launched troops against his fortress at Thaba Bosiu. Clearly,Gordon relished the opportunity for another accolade as Queen Victoria’s lonepeacemaker – his behaviour foreshadowing the bravado which would eventually seehim cut down by the Mahdi in Khartoum.It was in these circumstances that Gordon and Rhodes first encountered eachother, at a meeting Orpen had arranged with the Sotho chiefs at a village inThlotse Heights. For forty-nine-year-old Gordon it seems to have been love atfirst sight; for Rhodes, who was, at twenty-nine, more cautious, the basicresponse seems nevertheless to have been the same.The two men had much in common, apart from a shared passion for the Empire. Bothpreferred burly blue-eyed boys to women, and both eschewed marriage. Eachcorrectly foresaw that they would not reach old age (Rhodes died at forty-nine,Gordon at fifty-one). Blue-eyed Rhodes was six feet tall, and though smaller instature, Gordon was very fit, with a military bearing. He was ‘[g]ood looking …with a remarkable forehead, both broad and high,’ according to Lord Elton. Thepair spent every spare moment of the next four days together, walking greatdistances and talking endlessly: ‘The two talked long together, and eachconceived for the other a fascinated respect which he never forgot.’ Though thetwo men were bound by the conventions of the age, Elton nevertheless declares:‘They were attracted to each other.’ Similarly, Rotberg describes these two‘lonely men of misogynist impulse … absorbed in [their] gigantic dreams’, whowere ‘delighted to find each other’.Various biographers, including Lewis Michell, who had privileged access toRhodes’s papers, say that Gordon ‘pleaded’ with Rhodes to stay with him. ThoughRhodes was not to be swayed, Gordon pressed his suit: ‘There are very few men inthe world to whom I would make such an offer, very few men.’ Two years later, in1884, Rhodes refused another impassioned appeal from Gordon when the latter wason his way to Khartoum. In a conversation with E.A. Maund of The Times, Rhodesconfessed that Gordon had exercised a strange influence on him, describing the‘restless energy and force of character in this quiet unassuming man who claimedno merit and abhorred publicity’.In her 1933 biography, Sarah Gertrude Millin claimed that Rhodes was thedominant partner in the relationship. Having ignored Gordon’s appeal toaccompany him to Khartoum, Rhodes remarked that he would rather have tried to‘square the Mahdi’ than to ‘smash’ him. ‘Whereupon,’ continues Sarah GertrudeMillin, ‘Squaring the Mahdi – the idea of bribery – became an amusing catchwordemployed against Rhodes.’This meeting between the two Englishmen in the Basutoland bush represents amajor turning point in the story of Cecil Rhodes. Soon afterwards, Gordon wroteto a young member of the British Parliament – probably his lifelongcorrespondent, Reginald Baliol Brett – with an extraordinary proposal. In thisletter, which was later quoted in an article, ‘The Campaign against Corruption’,published in the Pall Mall Gazette,7 [part0037.html#ch7fn-7] Gordon proposed thesetting up of a British secret society devoted to many of the ideals in Rhodes’sown Confession of Faith. Moreover, Gordon proposed that its members be bound bystrict Jesuit-style disciplines – just as Rhodes himself had suggested regardinghis Society.That Regy Brett was the young MP to whom Gordon had written concerning theSecret Society is the consensus of most biographers, though this has never beenproved. While researching General Gordon for this book, however, I chanced upona series of connections not made before, which strongly suggest that Brett wasthe man. My source is Lytton Strachey’s Eminent Victorians, a set ofbiographical essays, including one on General Gordon. Here is what I learnt fromStrachey’s book: the choice of Gordon for the Sudan job was not popular with theBritons ruling Egypt, and was indeed rejected twice by the top diplomat inEgypt, Sir Evelyn Baring. But Gordon’s application then received powerfulsupport in an article published in the Pall Mall Gazette, which was written byW.T. Stead! (Rhodes had of course sought out Stead in London in the early 1880s,gone into business with him, and made him the executor of his will some yearslater.)Stead’s pro-Gordon article was immediately supported by Lord Hartington, head ofwhat Strachey describes as ‘the Imperial section’ of the Gladstone government.The person who was Hartington’s personal private secretary at this time, upuntil 1885, the year of Gordon’s death, was none other than Reginald BaliolBrett. During this time, Brett claims he was in continuous correspondence withGordon, and that Gordon’s last letter from Khartoum was addressed to him.With Rhodes, Stead, Gordon and Brett accounted for, only one name is missingfrom the list that would later comprise the ‘Elect’ of the Secret Society inBritain: Alfred Milner. But it turns out Milner is in fact on the list: he hadjoined the Pall Mall Gazette as assistant editor to Stead in 1881, staying on ina job for which he was singularly over-qualified, until 1885.The interval between the Basutoland meeting with Rhodes and Gordon’s subsequentletter to Brett is minimal, but the consequences of that meeting and the letterGordon wrote are nothing less than extraordinary. At the time, Gordon wasarguably the most famous general in the Empire and he was acquainted with manypowerful people. His military and diplomatic triumphs caused him to be fetedacross the Empire, and his admirers included fellow Companions of the Order ofthe Bath, senior politicians, military men, bishops, courtiers, foreign princes,emperors and kings, as well as the mighty Queen Victoria. After his brave,lonely death at Khartoum he became a legend. In contrast, Rhodes was at thistime all but unknown outside of South Africa. However, it would not be longbefore Rhodes was as famous as the deeply mourned Gordon. And always at Rhodes’sside was the man who would soon be his champion and the interlocutor with theBritish government, the man who eventually saved him from losing his Rhodesianwrit: Regy Brett.After 1891 two men, using Rhodes’s money, ran the cabal:8[part0037.html#ch7fn-8] the influential editor, W.T. Stead, and Alfred Milner,intellectual autocrat and soon-to-be high commissioner in South Africa. Lurkingin the wings were hugely powerful friends of the ever-expanding Secret Society,two of whom would soon be actively involved: international banker NathanRothschild, and the prime minister, Lord Rosebery.Together, Stead and Brett set up the Society of the Elect, a clandestine cliquethat would run the now English-based Secret Society. It was modelled on theloose framework proposed in the Confession of Faith, and also on a secretsociety Gordon had encountered in China: the College of Censors. The questionremains, however: How did Rhodes, a twenty-nine-year-old junior colonialpolitician, manage to persuade an imperial veteran of Gordon’s standing topromote a cause which Rhodes’s biographers have all dismissed as a juvenilefantasy?Sarah Gertrude Millin astutely observes of Rhodes: ‘He knew his mind and had aplan of life at the age of twenty. He came to Parliament with a definite purposewhich was nothing less than to make Africa British.’ She goes on to claim thatRhodes actually stated: ‘I went down to the Cape Parliament, thinking in mypractical way, I will go and take the North.’9 [part0037.html#ch7fn-9] SouthAfrica was just the first step in Rhodes’s grand design, and Chinese Gordon waswilling to conspire in this plan. Millin points out further that Rhodes nevergave up even the most unrealistic aspect of his Confession of Faith, thereincorporation of the United States into an English-controlled union. Shequotes from a letter Rhodes wrote to Stead just a few years before his death:‘Fancy the charm to young America to share in a scheme to take the Government ofthe world,’ and her conclusion is unequivocal: ‘The Government of the world wasRhodes’s simple desire.’This was the most secret of Rhodes’s secrets, and he never wavered from it. Hebelieved that his good fortune was nothing more than destiny justifying hismessianic beliefs and ambitions. Gordon was almost certainly the first person hehad ever met who dared hold similar beliefs, and they shared a plan putting theminto practice: a secret society operating along strict Jesuit or Chinese tong(i.e. gang) disciplines.Was Joseph Orpen right – were Rhodes and Gordon both ‘quite mad sometimes’? Itis Rotberg’s opinion that ‘Like Gordon, Rhodes was in some ways as simple as achild.’* * *The year 1881 proved a seminal one for young Rhodes. It was the year hecompleted his Oxford degree and entered Parliament, which resulted a year laterin his meeting Gordon. In 1881 the Pall Mall Gazette was in full flow under itsnew editor, W.T. Stead, as well. This was also the year that Alfred Milner –with his Double First from Balliol and a fellowship at All Souls, andcomfortably established in a London law firm – abruptly and somewhatinexplicably decided to quit and to go into journalism. This was anextraordinary deviation from Milner’s obvious career path: a mandarin in theEnglish civil service, beginning as high commissioner for South Africa andgovernor of the Cape. But as we shall see, Milner was also something of achameleon, preferring to live in the shadows, and something of a politicalenigma. Even more surprising is the fact that the newspaper Milner chose to join– Stead’s Pall Mall Gazette – was generally regarded as the ‘gutter’ press. Thelink between Milner, Rhodes and Gordon – three extraordinary minds that seemeddestined to meet – was Regy Brett.This proved to be more than a ‘conjunction of two meteors’. With Brett, Rhodes,Milner and Stead involved, it was more like the Big Bang. Together they resolvedto build a secret society, rich and influential, beyond ego or avarice, toremake the world in the image of the Confession of Faith, and to run it as theysaw fit.* * *In order to establish the extent to which Rhodes’s homosexuality influenced thedecisions he took and the manner in which he took them, it is necessary toinvestigate some of his other relationships. Foremost among these is hisfriendship with a young clerk he met in Kimberley during that important year of1881. Neville Pickering was his name, and three years later Rhodes rewrote hiswill, leaving his entire fortune – which by then had grown considerably – toPickering, who was also tasked with responsibility for the Secret Society. Thiscould only be an act of madness – or love.Rhodes’s more adoring biographers generally seem embarrassed by this secondwill, explaining it as a ‘noble gesture’ and suggesting it demonstrates howlittle Rhodes really cared for money. Yet this explanation ignores the coveringnote that accompanied this will: ‘My dear Pickering. Open the enclosed after mydeath. There is an old will of mine with Graham, whose conditions are verycurious, and can only be carried out by a trustworthy person, and I consider youone.’ A postscript follows: ‘You fully understand you are to use the interest[my emphasis] of the money as you like during your lifetime.’Neville Pickering had come to Rhodes’s assistance when he was in urgent need ofa secretary. Rhodes had just set up the De Beers Mining Company, and Pickering,born in Port Elizabeth, was working as a clerk for the firm of Dunell Ebdenwhich had sold the farm Vooruitzicht, where the Kimberley and De Beers diamondswere first discovered in 1871. When De Beers was registered as a joint-stockcompany in 1881, Rhodes resigned as company secretary and Pickering took overlater that year.Matters then proceeded apace. Within a few months the two men were livingtogether in a small tin shack where they entertained few visitors. Theirrelationship continued in this manner for the next four years.10[part0037.html#ch7fn-10] Pickering is generally remembered as a pleasant youngman, both sociable and popular. When Pickering first met Rhodes, he regularlywent to dances, apparently enjoying the female company, whereas Rhodes famouslyonly went ‘for the exercise’. However, girls dropped out of Pickering’s lifewhen, like others, he discovered that even a mention of marriage was enough tomake Rhodes throw a tantrum. In his relationship with Pickering, Rhodes isreferred to by early biographers as a ‘father-figure’ – rather nonsensically,however, as Rhodes was a mere four years older.It was not long before Pickering excelled at his job. He got his diamondbroker’s licence in 1881, and was mentioned by the De Beers chairman at the AGMas ‘one of the best brokers for the company’s diamonds at Kimberley’. Threeyears later, on 26 June 1884, Neville Pickering was thrown from a horse into aclump of wag’n-bietjie thorn bushes.Pickering had ‘thorns entering below the knees of both legs’ which were removedwith much pain and great difficulty, and within hours the wounds were infected.Some months previously, Pickering had been bedridden with so-called Kimberleyfever (probably dysentery) and was already in a weakened condition. A week laterhis physician, the young Dr Jameson, diagnosed blood poisoning and a relatedlung infection. Pickering was bedridden for a month and convalesced for almosttwo years on crutches. Sadly, Dr Jim was not able to cure Pickering, who slowlywasted away. No expense was spared, however, and Rhodes’s devotion throughoutthis period was unquestionable.Pickering’s illness was the start of Rhodes’s lifelong relationship withJameson, to whom he would likewise be devoted. Born in the same year as Rhodes,Jameson had also gone to Kimberley for health reasons. When Pickering died, DrJim moved in with Rhodes – and so began an intimate friendship that survived thefiasco of the Jameson Raid, right up to the time Jameson nursed Rhodes on hisdeathbed.At the time Pickering had his accident, Rhodes was buying gold claims on thefabulously rich Witwatersrand. But he immediately put these deals aside, andwhen he found that the coach to Kimberley was full he climbed onto the roof,where he sat with the mail bags for a rough and dusty 300-mile trip to Kimberleythat took more than fifteen hours. Once again, so much for Rhodes’s weak heartand poor lungs.Pickering hung on for another two months until he died on the morning of 18October 1886. Rhodes, who had hardly left his friend’s bedside, was devastated –and visibly so. Most of Kimberley turned out for the funeral, which took placelater that day. Rhodes and Neville’s brother, William, were the chief mourners,with Rhodes being openly grief-stricken, his tears punctuated by bursts ofhigh-pitched, maniacal laughter. A colleague, Sir David Harris, reported seeingRhodes and William seated together weeping, each insisting that the other shouldhave Neville’s timepiece.Rhodes spent that night at Dr Jim’s tin shack opposite the Kimberley Club, whichfrom then on was his Kimberley home. He never returned to the shack he hadshared with Pickering. Much gossip was provoked by the obvious depth of Rhodes’sgrief, which exceeded that of a master for an assistant. And when it becameknown that he had gone to live with Jameson, the rumours intensified.Jameson’s relationship with Rhodes has attracted more speculation than any otherof his friendships. They shared the shack for years: it was never more than ahovel, always untidy, with little more than an iron bed in each of the twobedrooms, and a few rough chairs and a table in the sitting room. Nonetheless,momentous decisions were taken in that humble abode. One such decision involveda ‘clash of the Titans’ when, after an all-night meeting, Rhodes eventuallysquared Barney Barnato and succeeded in taking over the Kimberley mines. Thescheme to take control of Matabeleland was also brewed between those walls.The pair mostly took their meals at the Kimberley Club opposite. Dr Jim wassmall in stature, lively and energetic. With his easy bedside manner, he alwayshad more patients than he could cope with. By this time, Rhodes was gainingweight and looked ten years older than his age. He had become increasinglytaciturn since Pickering’s death, and his humour had become somewhat sadistic.His angry outbursts, delivered in his characteristic falsetto, often verged onthe hysterical. ‘Yet what a man this was!’ exclaimed Brian Roberts, whose study,Cecil Rhodes and the Princess, is nevertheless not a hagiography, as thefollowing suggests:One may not admire his methods or agree with his scale of values; one mightconsider him intolerant ruthless and egocentric – a man obsessed by his owninterpretation of the world and its destiny – but one must stand aghast at hisachievements. Consider what he had done in twenty years; the twenty years whenmost men are struggling to find their feet. He had arrived in South Africa anailing inconspicuous lad. He had neither name nor influence to help him. He hadeducated himself. He had built up one [of] the largest financial empires of theworld. He had become Prime Minister of the Cape. He was 37 years old.Of course, neither Rhodes nor Jameson could ever admit to a homosexualattraction, but Jameson’s devotion to Rhodes is suggestive of more than merefriendship – indeed a tender intimacy. Jameson eventually gave up full-timedoctoring, a profession he loved, and took on the more dangerous jobs ofpioneering and exploration. In addition, he performed an administrative role inhelping to implement Rhodes’s schemes, some of which were decidedly dubious. Onesuch mission was to the hinterland to negotiate with the King of the Matabele,who had changed his mind about the Mashonaland mining concession he had grantedto Rudd. Jameson succeeded in reversing Lobengula’s decision, but only after hehad administered several shots of morphine for ‘gout’, and delivered the riflesRhodes had illegally shipped up from Kimberley.Following this was the catastrophic raid which Jameson, at Rhodes’s behest,mounted from Rhodesia against the Transvaal. This was the turning point inRhodes’s career, which will be described in more detail shortly. But if we aredebating here how Rhodes’s attraction to men adversely influenced many of hisdecisions, we need go no further than the Jameson Raid. Jameson’s rejection ofRhodes’s repeated orders to end the raid proved to be the death of Rhodes’spolitical career, yet Rhodes’s reaction was more resigned than angry. For allthe intimacy of their friendship, there is no clear evidence that this strangelydevoted pair had a sexual relationship. Throughout their time together, Rhodeswas intimate with a string of young men, some of whom were quite fey, and evencamp. Still, Dr Jim, for all his charm and conviviality, never, so far as isknown, had a sexual relationship with a woman, and he certainly never married.Rhodes had an obsession with loyalty and trust, which for him were euphemismsfor the power and duties of love. Pickering displayed these virtues, as didJameson, Stead – initially, at least – and Alfred Milner too. To each one ofthese men, Rhodes at one time or another bequeathed his rapidly growing fortune.And while they all made mistakes – in Jameson’s case, a devastating one – Rhodesalways forgave them. The exception was Stead, the only married, heterosexualmale among them, who disagreed with Rhodes over the Boer War, breaking theSociety’s code of loyalty. At first, Rhodes despaired, but then he dumped him.The many other young men in Rhodes’s life – the lovers rather than the loved –did not enjoy Rhodes’s trust in quite the same way as his intimates. AlthoughRhodes was generous with his bunch of ‘burly boys’, he gave them noresponsibilities, whether managing his fortune or the Secret Society – indeed,no evidence exists that they were even members of it. These relationships werecategorised differently – either boyfriend or bodyguard, angel or lamb.Rhodes’s trust, once given, was generally for life. While there were those whoquestioned Jameson’s sanity at the time of the raid, Rhodes never did. He infact went on to make Jameson – who had no administrative experience –administrator of Rhodesia. When Stead wavered, Rhodes told him to study Milner’sloyalty. And in the case of Pickering, he bequeathed him his fortune solely onthe grounds that he found him especially trustworthy – which is probably codefor ‘loving’.* * *Apart from Rhodes’s young men, there were also two women who claimed to haveloved him. One was Olive Schreiner, who nevertheless ended up loathing Rhodeslargely because of the male company he kept and his political choices. The otherwoman, Princess Catherine Radziwill, was a much more complicated individual.When Olive Schreiner first met Rhodes, she had just broken off her engagement toHavelock Ellis, a psychologist11 [part0037.html#ch7fn-11] who proved to besexually impotent. Schreiner herself is reputed to have had lesbian affairs.Rhodes respected Schreiner as a writer, though it is unlikely he harbouredtender thoughts towards her. When travelling, he often made a special stop tosee her at Matjiesfontein in the Great Karoo, where one of his cronies, JamesLogan, had built the grand Lord Milner Hotel along the new railway line fromCape Town to Kimberley. In 1890, Schreiner confided in W.T. Stead: ‘I feel acurious and almost painfully intense interest in the man and his career.’ Sadly,this friendship rapidly deteriorated into intense hatred on both sides. Theantipathy began when Rhodes put his name to a bill – nicknamed the ‘Strop Bill’– which permitted employers to administer corporal punishment to blacklabourers; it was exacerbated when, sometime later, Rhodes mercilessly put downthe Mashona and Matabele rebellions in Rhodesia. A humanitarian and a liberal,Schreiner’s reaction was damning: ‘The perception of what his character reallywas in its inmost depths was one of the most terrible revelations of my life.’Olive Schreiner’s Trooper Peter Halket of Mashonaland is a clear condemnation ofRhodes’s actions. But her obscure novella did little harm to Rhodes – and evenless to enhance Schreiner’s reputation. Rhodes’s defendants claimed the novellawas Schreiner’s revenge for Rhodes’s later remark that, with The Story of anAfrican Farm, she had written herself out and had no more to say. There was astrange confrontation when Schreiner and Rhodes booked passage on the same boatto England – she to deliver the manuscript of Peter Halket, he to be admitted asprivy councillor to the Queen. Each pretended the other did not exist, untilSchreiner became suspicious that Rhodes’s minions were planning to raid her roomto steal the manuscript. She called in the captain, and never spoke to Rhodesagain.When he first met Catherine Radziwill in 1897, Rhodes seemed quite fond of her.He paid her hotel bills in Cape Town, took her on long rides round themagnificent Cape peninsula, and even invited her to his home. But with her aswith Schreiner, it was Rhodes’s men who put an end to the relationship: Jamesonin the case of Radziwill, and Rhodes’s secretary, Philip Jourdan, in the case ofOlive Schreiner. Both men displayed jealousy, to the point that Schreinereventually made their relationship conditional on Rhodes not seeing so much ofhis male friends. Rhodes refused, of course: there can be little doubt that hehad reached a point where he could not do without their company or their advice.* * *As mentioned, Rhodes’s loves and lovers included the angels or lambs – the burlyblue-eyed men who provided him with solace and no small degree of personalprotection for the rest of his life. The actual origin of the terms ‘angels’ and‘lambs’ tells its own story. It was to twenty-three-year-old Frank Johnson thatRhodes gave the job of commissioning men to join his planned Pioneer Column tomarch northwards. Rhodes had picked him up in the Kimberley Club, and discoveredthat the young man had been a quartermaster-sergeant in the Bechuanaland PoliceForce.Rhodes himself had just been given an estimate of £1 million, based on a forceof 2,500 men, for mounting the expedition into Matabeleland. ‘I told him thefigures were absurd,’ Johnson would later write, offering instead to ‘walkthrough the country with a mere 250 men’. The two men went off to Rhodes’s shackwhere Rhodes asked Johnson to work out a detailed estimate; completed four hourslater, Johnson came up with a total of £87,500. Delighted, Rhodes offered hisnew friend total command of the expedition, and Johnson accepted a contract todeliver within nine months a country half the size of France that would be ‘fitfor civil government’.Some months later, while Johnson was attempting the difficult task of selectinghis 250 from the thousands of young men who, for seven shillings and sixpence aday plus the promise of a farm, had applied to join the Pioneer Column, Rhodesstormed in with his own list of twelve names which he demanded to be included.Johnson pointed out angrily that this would blow his budget. Rhodes peremptorilysaid he would personally pick up the bill for the twelve. The group became knownas Rhodes’s angels or lambs, for it was feared that when the column met the hugeMatabele army it would be ‘like lambs to the slaughter’ – as with the Britishdrummer-boys at the battle of Isandlwana.Two of the angels were Bob Coryndon – a gifted youth who not only loved Rhodesbut also played a considerable part in establishing Rhodesia – and Jack Grimmer,another twenty-three-year-old, whom Rhodes called ‘Johnny’. An amiable lout, hewas almost certainly Rhodes’s lover, as evidenced by an affectionate disrespecthe displayed towards Rhodes that did not, however, prevent him from survivingRhodes’s seraglio until the end.Frank Johnson’s story is also useful for the light it sheds on Rhodes’s reactionto acolytes who married. Somewhat miraculously, though ably assisted by thehunter-explorer Frederick Courteney Selous, Johnson completed the mission andalso set up Fort Salisbury in Mashonaland. He then mounted a hazardousexpedition through the Pungwe marshes into Portuguese East Africa to see whethera link to the sea might be possible. Johnson heard nothing from Rhodes until hereturned to Kimberley, where Rhodes greeted him with a testy ‘You got back.’ Nota word more. For Rhodes had discovered that Johnson was married. Rhodes wouldlater comment: ‘Johnson was lost before I first knew him.’* * *Following the tragic death of Neville Pickering, Rhodes’s workload neverthelessdemanded a replacement. He personally selected a series of likeable young men,some of whom did a reasonable amount of work, while others, like Grimmer, werenothing more than toy boys. A key to Rhodes’s selection, as usual, was hisbelief that these young men could be trusted – which, however, proved to be farfrom the case. Almost all wrote books about their time with Rhodes, with somecontaining sexual revelations.Harry Currey, son of the family that had looked after Rhodes from the time hearrived in Kimberley, was the first of the new secretaries, and probably thebest of a long line. Harry came on loan from the Cape Public Service, and heaccompanied Rhodes on his first political missions, proving himself essentiallytrustworthy. He turned twenty-three while in Rhodes’s service, and in his laterwritings referred to his employer as ‘the Great Man’. On one occasion, shortlyafter returning from England, Rhodes was heard screaming at Currey: ‘Leave myhouse! Leave my house!’ He had discovered Currey’s secret engagement. Curreyresigned as private secretary and left Rhodes’s employ after a final row, whichhe refused ever to discuss. But Rhodes did attend Currey’s wedding, telling thebride ‘I’m jealous of you.’ Harry Currey’s final word on the subject, some fiftyyears later, was: ‘Does he not so give himself to his “cause” that there is nomore room left in his heart for people?’Secretaries in love with Rhodes, lovers uncomfortable in dual roles, companionsand bodyguards: roles had begun to overlap. Johnny Grimmer’s dual role was themost outrageous of all. He enjoyed enormous influence over Rhodes, mocking andabusing him in front of his friends, but he was an inefficient secretary andeventually became such an embarrassment he was packed off to Rhodes’s remoteestate in the Inyanga mountains of Rhodesia. When a fellow politician upbraidedRhodes for employing an incompetent like Grimmer as his secretary, Rhodesreplied with a grin, ‘You haven’t seen him handling mules.’Also twenty-three years of age was Gordon le Sueur, who one day accompanied agroup of Cape civil servants to see Rhodes at Groote Schuur. Rhodes invited LeSueur then and there to accompany him to Rhodesia as his private secretary, eventhough Johnny Grimmer was already supposedly doing the job. A few days later,while driving his Cape cart, Rhodes stopped and told Le Sueur he was leaving forthe north that night and renewed his invitation. Le Sueur agreed and resignedhis parliamentary job the following morning. Rhodes gave him a cheque to pay offhis debts. Later, in Bulawayo, Rhodes told Le Sueur that he intended to takecare of him and gave the young man an envelope containing a bequest of £5,000.The two men had known each other a matter of weeks.By now, Rhodes was shameless in introducing such gauche companions into ‘polite’society. At luncheons in England and Europe, he would turn up with Grimmer andLe Sueur without informing the unfortunate hostess. The feckless pair thoughtnothing of playing embarrassing practical jokes on Rhodes, and on one occasion aduke famously complained that Le Sueur had smashed his fingers with his heavyhandshake: ‘I wish to God, Rhodes, that you would not bring these Africansavages over here.’ Yet Rhodes regarded himself as above criticism, even that ofdukes.Rhodes would eventually find a secretary to rival not only Pickering but alsoHarry Currey in the fey, pretty Philip Jourdan. Yet another parliamentary clerkin Rhodes’s office, Jourdan soon became obsessed with the great man:I used to take long solitary walks, thinking of nothing else but Rhodes, Rhodes,Rhodes and my devotion to him. Sometimes I felt I dared not even think of it. Itwas my great secret and I did not communicate it to a soul … sometimes I wouldlie awake half the night working myself up into a state of delirious excitement,speculating on the joy and pleasure which would be mine when I would be hissecretary, when I should always be with him and would go wherever he went.12[part0037.html#ch7fn-12]Then in March 1894 – by which time Rhodes was prime minister – the call came:chief clerk in the prime minister’s department! Jourdan was twenty-three. Helater confessed: ‘I was very fond of him. I felt I could do anything for him anddeveloped the strongest imaginable hero-worship for him. I was never happierthan when I was with him, even the thought that he was present in the house wasa source of happiness to me …’Jourdan continues in a similar vein throughout his book, and the implication isclear: Jourdan loved Rhodes – and it is possible that Rhodes also loved him. ‘Hewas exceedingly kind and tender towards me,’ Jourdan wrote, giving a poignantdescription of the physical intimacy that existed between them: ‘He made me drawmy chair quite close to him and frequently placed his hand on my shoulder. Heused to send for me even when he did not have any work for me.’ Rhodes also gavehim extra money, despite his protests: ‘I never cared to accept this money fromhim … but he would have his way and occasionally forced cheques upon me.’* * *The point is made and there is no need to labour it. Rhodes was attracted tomen, especially young men. When, as prime minister of the Cape, he eventuallyrestored and rebuilt Groote Schuur on land which today also houses the campus ofthe University of Cape Town,13 [part0037.html#ch7fn-13] he insisted that thereshould be only male workers.How well and how intimately Rhodes loved the men in his life is another matterentirely. Nevertheless, it is impossible to understate the power and theinfluence Rhodes would exert on British politics through a number of veryinfluential homosexual men he had yet to meet.The secretaries, with a couple of exceptions, lived full and happy lives. Amongthem, Harry Currey would die a venerable South African liberal politician, whilePhilip Jourdan would outlive them all. Jourdan remained true to Rhodes all hislife, though he seemingly grew less besotted with his hero as the years passed;indeed, three years after Rhodes’s death, he married a Kimberley girl and thecouple had three children. Footloose Gordon le Sueur died at forty-six, havingenjoyed the care and tender ‘protection’ of Dr Jameson, who continued to live atGroote Schuur. Jameson himself died in 1917, and was buried by Rhodes’s side ina rocky tomb near Bulawayo. The feckless Johnny Grimmer also remained close toRhodes, and accompanied the funeral cortège to the gravesite near Bulawayo.Unfortunately, however, he contracted malaria there; it turned into blackwaterfever and Grimmer died aged thirty-five.This brings us back to the first of Rhodes’s loves, Neville Pickering, the manwho perhaps instructed Rhodes in the art of love. It was for his dying friendthat Rhodes had endured a bruising fifteen-hour ride atop the night coach toKimberley. But it was only after Rhodes’s death that his papers revealed thehigh price of his devotion to Pickering: he almost lost out on making anothervast fortune in gold."},{"pageContent":"8Fortune’s FoolThe gold of the Witwatersrand, the world’s richest seam, was to play a pivotalpart in Rhodes’s extraordinary life. And as he stared hungrily into the Africanhinterland, Cecil Rhodes began to pay attention to his impecunious brotherHerbert. The latter had spent a lifetime lured by stories of gold, preciousgems, noble savages and lost cities beyond the far horizons – the stuff offiction, of King Solomon’s Mines, Allan Quatermain and She.The tales of H. Rider Haggard were my constant companions during my own family’soverland adventure to Africa. They were among the many books my father carriedin a battered Swiss rucksack as we bounced along rutted roads. My motherinsisted I read a chapter a night ‘to make sure he can still read at the end ofall this’. For me, these classic African adventure tales were a living reality,a narrative of a strange landscape of snow-capped volcanoes, stately savages andprolific wildlife. A single step could take me from these pages into an evenmore exotic reality. My father told me that Haggard had accompanied Rhodes on anadventure as big as ours, and that Rhodes had conquered this vast hinterland,named it ‘Rhodesia’, and made it safe for the families of returning colonialsoldiers. That was us, of course. Rhodesia had civilised standards, contented‘boys’ and ‘nannies’, and was ‘a veritable Shangri-La’ (which I thought was somekind of vegetable).It had been pretty primitive in Northern Rhodesia, my mother reminded him. She’dhad quite a turn when those five natives came out of the forest, carryingswords. True, my father admitted, but Northern Rhodesia was still the frontier.Cecil Rhodes hadn’t gone up that far. His railway had ended at the VictoriaFalls, where we were heading right then.I loved it all!* * *Rhodes set himself the task of raising the millions required not only to arm butalso to pay the wages and provisions of his Pioneer Column. He also needed tosquare the politics that blocked the road to the north. Rhodes began the processby using his own money.Almost simultaneously, he and Alfred Beit had come up with the idea ofconsolidating mining claims, and after token negotiations, decided to do it inpartnership. Though Beit’s fortune was much larger than that of Rhodes, thelatter’s powers of persuasion prevailed. Rhodes had the vision, Beit thefinancial acumen. Of course, the talks were conducted in secret. There wereother serious problems as well: smallpox had hit Kimberley, and poor sanitaryconditions resulted in 2,300 infections and 700 deaths. Medical teams brought into assist with the smallpox discovered that syphilis was rife, with fatalitiessecond only to smallpox.Rhodes was far from being a lone player in the battle for control of the diamondbonanza. In 1886, both English Rothschilds as well as some other bankers hadcontemplated amalgamating the mines, but decided that the 3,600 claims owned by98 companies and individuals were beyond even their considerable resources andnegotiating skills. By now, the Kimberley mine was a terraced hole, 400 feetdeep and about half a mile in circumference, with every inch being scraped at byhopeful miners. Rhodes had his eye on a multitude of claims: on the west side,owned by the Standard Company; on the east side, owned by the Central Company;some scattered ones owned by the Cape of Good Hope Bank; and a line along thecentre owned by the French Company.Standing firm on the east side was Barney Barnato. He controlled the CentralCompany, having amalgamated with Baring-Gould, and his rise from rags to richeswas even more spectacular than that of Rhodes. Born in the Jewish ghetto ofLondon’s East End, Barnet Isaacs arrived in Kimberley with his horse and cart,hoping to be a trader. He supplemented his meagre income by boxing, conjuringand selling dubious cigars – until he bought a couple of rough diamonds. Hisbrother joined him, and not long afterwards they were buying diamond mines.After much manoeuvring, Rhodes managed to persuade backers like NathanRothschild, Alfred Beit and the Barings family. There was only one other bigplayer who was still in the Game: Barney Barnato. Many believed that Rhodes beatBarney Barnato by means of hard cash as well as charisma. The charm offensivehad begun with Rhodes guaranteeing that he could arrange for Barnato to be amember of the Kimberley Club, a rare privilege for a Jew. When Barnato pointedout that the club already had some Jewish members, Rhodes went one better andpromised him a seat in Parliament. Rhodes kept his word and Barney Barnato dulybecame an MP.* * *In 1888 Rhodes established the De Beers Consolidated Mining Company, and by1890, when he was thirty-seven, the company controlled the price of the world’sdiamonds – as it continues to do. De Beers is believed to have paid BarneyBarnato £4 million, the equivalent of £2.3 billion today, for his share. Butthere was one hitch before the deal was done. When Rhodes produced the trustdocument defining the reach of the new company, Barnato realised it waseffectively a document to facilitate the expansion of the Empire. He himselfregarded Empire-building as a waste of money, and that entire day, and well intothe night, Barnato resisted the sale. However, as we now know, he eventually bitthe golden bullet.Rhodes used the company to buy mines, houses, farms and water rights; it couldtrade in minerals and machinery, patents and goods, anywhere in the world. Itcould construct railways, factories, dams and reservoirs, and even engage inbanking. The company was free to acquire tracts of land in Africa or elsewhere,exploit rights ceded to it by indigenous leaders, and if necessary spend itsmoney on the pacification and administration of this territory. Quite simply,Rhodes could go Empire-building – and there were now strong hints that he wouldsoon be getting on with the job.Early in the 1880s, some of Rhodes’s more intimate friends, including theentrepreneurial medical doctor Hans Sauer, began to suggest that Rhodes’sbrother Herbert may have been right about the rumoured gold. Rhodes,understandably, had not trusted his maverick sibling, and was sceptical of hissuggestions (by then, in any case, Rhodes had his own secret El Dorado – the‘lost city’ in Mashonaland). But his Scottish partner, John Rudd, was lessdoubtful and certainly less cautious, and called in expert American geologiststo review the rumours.One morning, Hans Sauer arrived at Rhodes’s shack carrying rock samples thatoriginated not from some far-flung fabled place but from farmland near thegrowing Transvaal settlement called Johannesburg. Rhodes was openly sceptical,so much so that he did not even bother to get up from bed when he spoke toSauer. Johannesburg, he pointed out, was Oom Paul Kruger’s heartland, and nobodyhated Rhodes more than Oom Paul did. He told Sauer to come back the followingday.Overnight, though, Rhodes seems to have changed his mind. When Sauer returnedthe next morning, he found Rhodes in the company of two Australian miners whopanned the samples and confirmed that they were rich in gold. Sauer wasinstructed to board the first stagecoach and start buying up land. The followingmorning when Sauer arrived at the stagecoach terminal he found Rhodes and Ruddalready there. Even so, they almost missed the boat. It soon became a classic‘gold rush’ as news spread like a veld fire. Sauer took options on whatever landwas available, but he had stiff competition from Barnato and Beit. Anotherproblem was the sudden lack of interest on the part of Rhodes – who had just hadnews of his injured friend, Neville Pickering.In his autobiography Ex Africa, Sauer vividly conveys the general shock atRhodes’s sudden departure for Kimberley that winter’s night. He was abandoningthe prospect of a huge fortune just to be by the bedside of a dying companion.The rumour mills were active, and Sauer and his friends tried to turn what wasobviously a tragic love story into a bizarre badge of honour: Rhodes was abovemere mortals, of such noble character that he set friendship above fortune. Ofcourse there is an element of nobility in Rhodes’s devotion – but emphasisingthis ignores the true nature of the intense friendship between the two men. Inhis display of devotion, Rhodes defied the prohibitions of his time. BrianRoberts cogently observes:Had he done as much for any woman, there would have been no need to transformhim into a demi-god in order to explain an act of love. But Pickering was a man,and as a man could not be considered in such simple terms; Rhodes mighttranscend common humanity but he could not be allowed to transgress aconventional code of behaviour. It therefore became necessary to interpret ahuman weakness, calling for compassion, as superhuman strength, defyingcredibility.1 [part0037.html#ch8fn-1]It is not entirely true that throughout his sojourn in Kimberley Rhodes hadneglected his buying operation on the Witwatersrand, thereby losing the chanceof controlling the goldfields in addition to the diamond mines. Hans Sauer wrotein Ex Africa that Rhodes promised to wire him about two outstanding options onsome farms, but once back in Kimberley he allowed his business affairs to slide.This feeds into the myth of the noble, devoted Rhodes. However, the truth isthat Rhodes did maintain essential telegraph contact at least with Rudd; hislacklustre performance may simply have been the result of misinformation.In 1887 Rhodes appointed a skilled mining engineer, Gardner Williams, as generalmanager of De Beers. Williams was probably the best man available, and Rhodeshad benefited greatly from his advice in the amalgamation of his diamondbusiness. But the opinion Williams gave Rhodes on the Witwatersrand goldfieldsafter an inspection commissioned by Nathan Rothschild was spectacularly wrong.The reefs, he warned, were shallow, and the deeper reefs were likely to becontaminated with iron pyrites – fool’s gold.Rhodes later admitted that he had ‘returned too late to buy into the richerparts’ and blamed it on ‘bad luck’, which may well have been the case. Barnato,for example, who had got in earlier, was milling five to ten ounces of gold froma ton of ore on the land he had bought. Rhodes’s own mines rarely produced muchmore than an ounce per ton. This is not to say, however, that Rhodes did notmake money on the Witwatersrand. Stuck for whatever reason with the poorer land,Rhodes reverted to being the skilled entrepreneur of his early Kimberley days.He was soon making a tidy fortune from this land by selling claims to hungryprospectors rushing to the Rand with fat pocketbooks.But none of the above – not his Kimberley absence, nor the lack of supportextended to Sauer who had correctly predicted the vast wealth soon to be dugfrom the Rand, and especially not Rhodes’s reluctance to employ the huge capitalresources now pouring in from diamond sales – can properly explain why Rhodesmarked time on the Witwatersrand. He more or less left the company that he andRudd had formed, Gold Fields of South Africa, to Rudd to manage, and Rudd did sovery competently. At an annual general meeting of shareholders, he correctlypredicted: ‘Witwatersrand after a year or two is, in my opinion, going to be thebiggest goldfield in the world.’ But by the end of 1889 Gold Fields had soldmost of its Rand holdings and Rhodes seemed to have lost interest, devotinghimself instead to his parliamentary work and the diamond business.There has to be another reason for Rhodes’s attitude, for Rhodes was never thisslow or indeed careless in any business he set his mind to; it was completelyout of character. Had he applied just a fraction of the energy and acumen to thegold rush as he had devoted to the far more difficult task of taking control ofthe diamond business, he would have had a much larger stake in theWitwatersrand.The stories about Rhodes neglecting his gold business for love of Pickering maywell be off the mark, and a more simple explanation could be that theWitwatersrand gold rush came at the wrong time for him. Having set his diamondempire in place, and secure in the knowledge that it would go on making hugeprofits, Rhodes was ready to move on to his master plan: the conquest of Africaand the country where Solomon had mined his gold. Far from taking his eye offthe ball, Rhodes had simply shifted his focus.* * *Sidney Shippard, from the start a member of the Secret Society, recallsconversations with Rhodes as they walked in Christ Church Meadow during theirtime together at Oxford, where they ‘discussed and sketched out the whole planof British advance in south and central Africa’. Jameson also records how atthis time Rhodes ‘dwelt repeatedly on the fact that their great want was newterritory fit for the [English] overflow population to settle in permanently,and thus provide markets for the wares of the old country – the workshop of theworld’.These conversations took place before the dramatic change in Rhodes’s fortunes,before he had accumulated an amount of money that was more than adequate to fundhis fantasies. Rhodes knew, or at least sensed, that he had the Midas touch.Every one of his endeavours – whether the conquest of territories, agriculturalinnovation, educational endowments, even the establishment of a dynamite factory– succeeded spectacularly, thanks to his business acumen, his luck, and hisabsolute belief in his destiny.The one thing Rhodes lacked, or thought he lacked, was time, so it seemed properthat he should leave the development of their gold business to Rudd, Sauer andBeit while he got on with the job of running De Beers in accordance with thewide mandate for exploration he had inherited from Barnato. In terms offinancing, everything was in place for an assault on the north – but this wasnot the case for either the route or the politicians controlling that route, andit was to this that Rhodes now devoted himself. He needed to square the Boers ofthe north through his relationship with the Dutch leader of the Cape, JanHofmeyr. Rhodes knew that without the backing of the Boers he could not make astart on his grand plan for Africa, the first part of which was to federate thesouth.For a committed Anglophile like Rhodes, it was difficult to like the Boers, andthe Voortrekkers in particular. The Voortrekkers hated the British, to theextent that they had trekked away from the Cape. These semi-nomadic pastoralistsdesired not only freedom from British rule, but also from urban restrictions, asthey moved from place to place in search of grazing land for their cattle. Thatthis land was occupied by Africans was unimportant. They believed these blackpeople were the descendants of the tribes of Ham, condemned by God to servitude.Rhodes made overtures to Hofmeyr, eventually winning him over to the idea of afederated South Africa which would include the Boer states. Squaring Hofmeyr’sAfrikander Bond was crucial to Rhodes’s federal plan, as Dutch-speaking membersoutnumbered English-speaking members of the Cape Parliament by two to one.Hofmeyr also had a certain amount of influence over the Boers of the Orange FreeState and Transvaal republics.Hofmeyr supported Rhodes’s stand against General Charles Warren’s proposal thatthe whole of Bechuanaland be declared a Crown Colony, financed by the sale ofthousands of acres of farmland – exclusively to British settlers. At greatpolitical risk to himself, Rhodes vehemently spoke out against this plan inParliament: ‘I think all would recognise I am an Englishman, and one of mystrongest feelings is loyalty to my own country. [I call] on every Englishman inthe house to raise his voice against the exclusion of colonists of Dutchdescent. The introduction of race distinction must result in bringing calamityon this country.’ For the times, this was exceptionally liberal thinking; it wasalso prescient, given the disparate class and race mix of the Cape. Rhodes’sspeech won him few friends among the Cape British and earned him the title ‘BoerLover’ back in the home country.The upshot was the rejection of the Warren plan – which caused permanent enmitybetween Warren and Rhodes – but Rhodes stuck to his guns, later telling aBritish audience: ‘Only through a course of firmness and impartiality can wehope to see the day when the separate States of South Africa will be a unitedEmpire under the English flag.’ Most biographers contend that Rhodes wasconcerned solely with the interests of the white race, but he had a morepragmatic view. Much informal commerce was already in the hands of the‘coloured’ people of the Cape, and Rhodes realised that its English-speakingcitizens could only command a parliamentary majority if this mixed-racepopulation had the franchise. He scorned those who believed that power couldreside solely in the hands of a white population which was smaller than that ofa minor English town.* * *Through the agency of the embryonic Secret Society in England, Rhodes wasbeginning to lay the foundations of a much grander plan – a federated imperialparliament. In the crucial year of 1885, Alfred Milner was establishing hisreputation as a political journalist, before eventually becoming assistanteditor to W.T. Stead on the Pall Mall Gazette. Stead himself would soon beappointed head of Rhodes’s Secret Society, as well as executor of hispenultimate will. Alfred Milner would follow in Stead’s footsteps. The playersin this particular imperial game were beginning to coalesce.Late in 1885, Milner abruptly abandoned journalism and tried – thoughunsuccessfully – for a seat in Parliament. He then took a job as privatesecretary to George Goschen – later Lord Goschen – one of the most influentialmen in England who, like Milner, had a German education. Goschen, formerdirector of the Bank of England, later served as Chancellor of the Exchequer inLord Salisbury’s government. He would certainly have known Reginald Brett, nowLord Esher, whose Journals contain a report of a meeting held at LordRothschild’s house – a political gathering which included Goschen himself, aswell as Esher, Stead, Milner, Rhodes and several other prominent politicians,including soon-to-be prime minister, Arthur Balfour. ‘Rhodes has vast ideas.Imperial notions,’ Brett recorded, suggesting that Rhodes had sounded off on theideas in his Confession of Faith.By now Rhodes’s secret plan for imperial domination was up and running inEngland. This is evident from his deal with W.T. Stead, which led directly tothe establishment of the Secret Society in England. To suggest that Stead, Brettand Milner meeting up with one another in 1885 was pure coincidence does notmake sense, as all three men eventually became seminal players in Rhodes’sSecret Society. But at this point the extent of Rhodes’s imperial ambitions wereas yet unclear. Years later, when questioned by a concerned Sir HerculesRobinson – governor of the Cape at the time – as to the planned destination ofthe Pioneer Column, Rhodes replied that it would stop only once it reachedunclaimed territory. Pointing to a map, he indicated the Tanganyika border justsouth of the Great Lakes region and Uganda, the country the British eventuallyconquered and renamed in 1894.Rhodes’s neighbour, fellow parliamentarian and one-time editor of the CapeTimes, T.E. Fuller, provides a vivid account of Rhodes’s unbridled andinfectious enthusiasm:2 [part0037.html#ch8fn-2]It was one of those scorching summer days when no-one seemed inclined for workor, indeed, to go out of doors. The cabs stood in ranks in the middle ofAdderley Street without customers and old Table Mountain rose like a hugeshadowless wall in the blazing noontide heat.Mr Rhodes as apparently unoccupied as ourselves, came into the room and startedon the map and the trouble was to get him or ourselves away from it. Hediscoursed for a full hour on ‘the land and its people’ and his own schemes. Wesoon forgot the heat under the spell of his enthusiasms.Pointing with his finger, he described the proposed route of his railway fromUjiji to Victoria Nyanza, and thence through the Lake Rudolph district along theAbyssinian highlands to the ‘Blue Nile’, mentioning especially if I rememberrightly, Western Abyssinia where the population was very thick and, to a certainextent, under the influence of the Mohammedan civilization … describing it as‘the vertebrae and the spinal cord which would direct, consolidate and give lifeto the numerous systems which would eventually connect the vast centralhighlands with the sea’ … the great inland sea to which his territory was tostretch, and to the equatorial lakes and the vast spaces of water and the‘turmoil of hills’ with which they were surrounded.Lamenting the fact that he could only give ‘a bare outline of the expansionscheme’, Fuller was concerned that Rhodes’s ‘stupendous task’ might ‘not beunderstood’. And today, as Table Mountain rises ‘like a huge shadowless wall’outside my window as I write, Rhodes’s dream of dominance of Africa and itspeople continues to elude comprehension. Fuller’s journalistic account ofRhodes’s ambitions is confirmed by young Ralph Richards, a member of GeneralWarren’s Border Force, which Rhodes used as part of his plan to keep the routenorthwards open. Richards later recorded his experiences in 1885 while he andRhodes were in Vryburg, waiting for Warren to arrive: ‘He had no real sketch ofRhodesia in his head. He knew nothing of the country whereas I knew a greatdeal. It was to take the lake country of Tanganyika and the lakes to the northof it which Rhodes then wished for and his primary concern was to keep the roadthither open.’Rhodes clearly had no ‘sketch’ in his head, no idea at all of the terrain heplanned to traverse: the Zambezi with its mighty falls, the meandering Congo,massive mountains like Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya, endless savannahs, inlandlakes the size of small seas. Moreover, Alfred Milner, the man who would inheritthese dreams as well as the task of implementing them, was more of an aesthetethan a frontiersman. Milner’s first posting by Lord Goschen was asundersecretary for finance in Egypt in 1887–92, where he was introduced to acertain Horatio Herbert Kitchener, at the time an intelligence officer in Egypt.For five years, Milner and Kitchener worked together on the same imperial teamwhich, two years previously, included General Gordon in Khartoum.Gordon and Kitchener were good friends, part of a group that by now includedBrett, who, during the Great War, would run a clandestine intelligence servicefor Kitchener. To this list we can now add Milner. Many of these men werehomosexual, and there is no denying that they strongly influenced Britishpolitics from late Victorian times through the Edwardian period. Brett kept ajournal in which he recorded his affairs with men and boys, while Rhodes, as wehave seen, had his band of brothers, his angels and lambs, as well as NevillePickering, with whom he lived. Gordon had his brandy and his boys, whileKitchener had ‘a constant and inseparable companion’ in his aide-de-camp,Captain Oswald FitzGerald, with whom he perished in 1916 in a torpedoed ship.Kitchener, like Gordon and Rhodes, avoided contact with women, took a great dealof interest in the Boy Scout movement, and decorated his rose garden with fourpairs of bronze sculptures of boys. There have been similar speculations aboutMilner, whose sexual interests were, however, fairly conventional.3[part0037.html#ch8fn-3]More than merely close friends and allies, these men also shared an intimacy andtrust. When Rhodes heard that Kitchener was in Khartoum avenging Gordon, hetelegraphed rather rakishly: ‘Glad you beat the Khalifa … my telegraph willshortly be at the south end of Tanganyika. If you don’t look sharp in spite ofyour victory I shall reach Uganda before you.’ To this, the great generalreplied: ‘Hurry up.’What is certain is that these four giants – Rhodes, Gordon, Kitchener and Milner– shared a similar imperial dream. Milner, though by far the most enigmatic ofthe four, clarified his position in a credo later discovered among his papers:If I am an Imperialist, it is because the destiny of the English race, owing toits insular position and long supremacy at sea, has been to strike roots indifferent parts of the world. I am an Imperialist and not a Little Englanderbecause I am a British Race Patriot … The British State must follow the race,must comprehend it, wherever it settles in appreciable numbers as an independentcommunity. If the swarms constantly being thrown off by the parent hive are lostto the State, the State is irreparably weakened. We cannot afford to part withso much of our best blood. We have already parted with much of it, to form themillions of another separate but fortunately friendly State [America]. We cannotsuffer a repetition of the process.These were the halcyon days of Empire. America was only just beginning toacquire economic status, and even that wealth was in the private hands offamilies like the Astors, the Vanderbilts, the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers– all of whom had planted roots in Britain. American heiresses who had marriedinto British aristocracy willingly contributed to the funding of the Empire inreturn for a title. India was a hopeless sprawl of squalor ruled loftily by aBritish viceroy; China was the ‘Yellow Peril’ controlled by English opiumentrepreneurs and mercenaries like ‘Chinese’ Gordon, who also helped subdueparts of the Middle East. Much of the rest of the world was either a colony or,like America, an ex-colony; a protectorate, a dependency, a mandate, or aterritory within the British ‘sphere of influence’ – or at least that of anotherEuropean power.While the ‘scramble for Africa’ was by no means over, the continent remainedessentially terra incognita, with much ‘unclaimed land’, as Rhodes had put it tothe Cape governor, Sir Hercules Robinson. Rhodes saw no difficulty ‘squaring’ orbrushing aside any of the European powers – the French, the Belgians and thePortuguese – who laid claim to territory in his path. The only country he tookseriously was Germany: there was every possibility it might go to war withEngland over its new territories, which, fortuitously, were far to the east andto the west of Rhodes’s proposed route northwards. Not so, however, theterritories of the Boer republics, whom Germany seemed ready to supportdiplomatically and to defend militarily. You simply never knew what to expectwith Kaiser Wilhelm.Thus it was that in 1887, during the annual Christmas festivities inGrahamstown, Sir Hercules Robinson was confronted by an agitated Cecil Rhodes,accompanied by Sidney Shippard, who was by now administrator of Bechuanaland.The two men were the bearers of dire news: wily Oom Paul Kruger had sent histrusted agent Pieter Grobler, an Ndebele-speaker, on a mission to the kraal ofLobengula, King of the Matabele. Grobler threatened to send a Boer commandounless the King agreed to a concession for hunting and trading rights in histerritory, and foreswore dealings with any other foreign power. But there wasworse to come. Rhodes had it on good authority that the initiative was backed byGermany, and that Grobler had been granted the concession. The King had sworn‘perpetual peace and friendship’ and declared himself ‘an ally of the SouthAfrica Republic’. The deal had been drafted by Kruger himself in defiance of atleast two solemn territorial promises made to the British.All this had been confirmed by Ralph Williams, now ‘Her Majesty’s Agent’ inPretoria, whose task was to spy on President Kruger. He had reported to Rhodesthat, during a game of cricket, a merchant friend had called him off the pitchand said to him, ‘Do you see that man out there loading his wagon? That man isGrobler. He is starting tomorrow to try and revive an old half-promise made tothe Boers many years ago.’ Then Shippard delivered the final blow: it wasrumoured that Grobler had been murdered while returning home throughBechuanaland, and Kruger was apoplectic, blaming Rhodes personally for themurder. They now might be on the brink of war with the Boers – who had beenspending their new mineral wealth on modern German Krupp artillery and machineguns."},{"pageContent":"9King Solomon’s MinesRhodes, it has to be said, had feared the worst of the Boers to the north fromthe time he entered Parliament. Paul Kruger, in turn, had noted Rhodes’spresence in the Cape Parliament and been suspicious from the start. He was alsowary of Rhodes’s close relationship with Bond leader Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr. It wasin this fraught environment that Rhodes was accused of orchestrating the murderof the Boer envoy to Lobengula. While it is possible that Rhodes had some sortof role in the murder, nothing was ever formally alleged or proven, and Rhodesacted fast to avoid any further damage.Shippard, Rhodes’s closest personal and political ally, sent the idealconciliator to Lobengula’s court: John Smith Moffat, son of Robert Moffat,legendary missionary and Lobengula’s trusted friend. John Moffat hadconsiderable influence in his own right, however, being the brother-in-law ofthe most famous missionary of all, David Livingstone. Moffat had left missionaryservice to become Shippard’s assistant.* * *The Grobler incident spurred Rhodes on in his quest to invade the north. Rhodeswas now convinced by, if not obsessed with, the idea that Mashonaland held thebiblical temple built by the Queen of Sheba for Solomon. A number of Rhodes’sfollowers shared these weird and wonderful beliefs, including Arthur Conan Doyleand W.T. Stead, the newspaperman who was also a famous medium. There was, at thetime, broad interest in the occult, and one of Rhodes’s close associates, ArthurBalfour, was the son of the family that founded the Society for PsychicalResearch. Another such associate was Rudyard Kipling, who spent many winterswith Rhodes at Groote Schuur.The interior of Groote Schuur is dark and gloomy, even in the daytime, and heavyVictorian drapes are kept drawn as protection from sunlight and heat. It was inRhodes’s bedroom that Alta Kriel had shown me the stone bird which WilliePosselt had stolen for him from the fabled ‘lost’ city in Mashonaland. Rhodeshad, she informed me, been fixated on the Ra bird as well as other artefactsfrom Mashonaland, many of them made of gold. ‘Rhodes told his visitors thatthere were ghosts in Groote Schuur, and he virtually worshipped the stone birdwe have here. It was always kept in his bedroom, on top of a wardrobe, and itwas said he never took a major decision without it being present.’ When SirHerbert Baker rebuilt Groote Schuur after the fire, Rhodes had all the newelposts on the main staircase carved in the image of the stone bird.For a brief period at Oxford, Rhodes was a Freemason, and his Groote Schuurlibrary shelves held many books on topics such as the Rosicrucians and AnnieBesant’s Theosophical Society. One such book dealt with the Hermetic Order ofthe Golden Dawn, a closed society similar to Rhodes’s own Secret Society.Rhodes knew from Willie Posselt that the ‘lost city’ was just a week’s marchnorth of Lobengula’s kraal in Bulawayo. There was even a ‘Saba’ (Sheba) riverwinding its way through ‘Ophir’. Rhodes had secretly arranged for this river, aswell as the Mazoe, a tributary of the Zambezi, to be ‘panned’, and both hadproduced workable quantities of alluvial gold. Rhodes’s belief that he hadstumbled upon ancient Ophir became his best-kept secret. It is no exaggerationto say that without what Rudd called the ‘Ophir promise’ and the stone birdWillie Posselt had stolen from the site, Rhodes might never have bothered toraise the money he needed to invade Mashonaland and eventually establishRhodesia.He had a special box made for the bird, carved from African hardwoods and linedwith velvet. Thus armed with what he regarded as certain evidence of Ophir andSolomon’s mines, Rhodes embarked on a tour of the City of London andThreadneedle Street, assiduously hunting down investors for the British SouthAfrica Company. Their response was hugely enthusiastic.* * *British settlers generally adopted this origin theory with enthusiasm. My ownfamily saw itself as honorary heirs of ancient travellers from the deserts ofArabia who had built and ruled from stone castles, trading gold through theirport of Sofala on the east coast of Africa. In fact, Rhodes’s pitch to theLondon financiers was not entirely a fabrication. Thousands of ancient goldmines – ‘King Solomon’s mines’ – were subsequently found alongside the ancientzimbabwes by prospectors Rhodes had brought in as pioneers. Tales that GreatZimbabwe1 [part0037.html#ch9fn-1] was built by a ‘civilised’ (white) race fromfar to the north abounded, a much-contested history that persisted until wellinto the twentieth century. This theory was proposed by the first RoyalGeographical Expedition to explore the ruins. Prime Minister Ian Smith put aWhite Paper through Parliament banning any suggestion that Great Zimbabwe was aculture of native origin. Robert Mugabe hooted with derision, and when Britishrule ended in 1980 the country was renamed the Republic of Zimbabwe.* * *The year 1887 signalled a turning point in Rhodes’s life. The road to Ophir wasblocked, and he had to tackle the damage done by Pieter Grobler, Paul Kruger’senvoy to Lobengula, who had coerced the King into signing a peace treaty,presented to the King by General P.J. Joubert, with the Transvaal.Rhodes dismissed the treaty as a fake, claiming there were no independent whitewitnesses. However, Sidney Shippard, who was probably the most powerful memberof the Secret Society at the time, warned Rhodes against complacency. This was agenuine obstacle, and it had to be dealt with – fast. The Germans were almostcertainly involved. Shippard, with Rhodes’s support, had been appointedcommissioner for Bechuanaland, and as such was custodian of the territory to thewest of the Transvaal which Rhodes regarded as his ‘Suez Canal’ to the north.Following Rhodes’s intervention in 1884, the two new Boer republics of Goshenand Stellaland – whose legality Rhodes dismissed – were abolished, therebyopening the route to the north.Shippard warned Rhodes: ‘Our work is to see that we do not get shut in by theGermans cutting across our path.’ His fear of the Germans was real and tangible.Kruger may have deferred in the past to British military might, but with hisnewfound wealth from Witwatersrand gold he was also secretly acquiring Germanartillery that posed a real threat to his old enemy. Rhodes’s dream of rulingOphir and re-opening its ancient mines was being pre-empted by Boer diplomacy.The Boers knew all about Ophir from Mauch and Pastor Merensky – and they wantedit too.With Neville Pickering’s death, Rhodes had also reached a crossroads in hispersonal life and had emerged from it a changed man. It had been another bitterepiphany. By consolidating the diamond mines of Kimberley, he had accumulatedthe fortune he needed to start his occupation of ‘empty’ Africa – only to losethe love and, in a sense, the purpose of his life in Pickering’s early demise.Moreover, Pickering’s death at just thirty years of age left Rhodes ever moreconvinced that he too could die young, and probably would.Rhodes entered that fateful year of 1887 a young and still essentially naiveentrepreneur. He emerged from it a cynic with a short temper and a caustic senseof humour. And nobody was ever able to explain this change because the Pickeringaffair was never recognised – and certainly not as a love affair.* * *This hard-nosed Rhodes of the late 1880s was an entrepreneur of style andcourage – still blessed with good luck, though all was not plain sailing.Shippard’s man, John Smith Moffat, was in place at Lobengula’s kraal, contestingthe validity of the Joubert treaty and trying to prevent its implementation. Atthe same time, Rhodes was making demands on the governor, Hercules Robinson,that Britain should direct General Warren to annex Matabeleland. Fearful of aGerman reaction, however, Robinson vetoed the idea.Rhodes also had to deal with Kruger’s allegation that he had been behind theambush and murder of the Boer emissary taking the Joubert treaty back to Kruger.And while there was no evidence to support this, Rhodes by now had gained a badreputation: people speculated about his vested interests in the murder, and whobut he had the means and money to carry it out?Rhodes went on the attack, suggesting that Kruger was illiterate andincompetent, and that his treaty was not worth the paper it was written on. Hesummoned a formidable group to leave for Bulawayo immediately: Jameson, JohnRudd, lawyer James Rochfort Maguire and his tough Ndebele-speaking minesupervisor Francis Thompson. Robinson again advised Rhodes to tread warily.Queen Victoria would never agree to an invasion force against Kruger, and norwould her first minister, Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, Lord Salisbury.The latter, warned Robinson, regarded Bismarck’s Germany as a ‘hornet’s nest ofPrussian militarism’, always at the ready, and Rhodes’s Pioneer Column mighteasily provoke an attack. Certainly they were to make no mention of Ophir orlost cities.Robinson proposed a diplomatic solution. He likewise doubted the legality of theBoer treaty and promised Rhodes that, as a representative of Britain, he wouldgive him his support. Obviously they had to move quickly, and so the day afterChristmas a messenger was dispatched, bearing the British offer. Riding day andnight, he reached Bulawayo, 700 miles distant, in record time, and by February1888 Moffat had persuaded Lobengula to switch allegiances and declare thetrans-Limpopo region ‘within the British sphere of influence’. That same yearthe Portuguese published a map showing Lobengula’s territory as a Portuguesepossession. The race for southern Africa was on.Moffat’s treaty promised ‘Peace and Amity’ between Victoria – the ‘Great WhiteQueen of England’ – and Lobengula – ‘Mighty Elephant of Matabeleland’. Barnatohad ceded his rights, and now, armed with the De Beers Trust document, Rhodesbegan to map out the next stage of the Game, which would deliver Mashonalandinto his hands. He quickly bought out several other claimants to theMatabeleland concessions, including a witnessed and therefore valid one obtainedby Selous. The explorer soon succumbed to Rhodes’s offer of a huge tract of landin Mashonaland – which was not yet his to promise – and ended up agreeing toscout the route of the Pioneer Column.The Moffat treaty started its own little gold rush. Frank Johnson obtained a400-square-mile mining concession in Ngwato territory west of Mashonaland. In afew short months the concession was sold, first to the French Caisse de Mines ofParis and then to the Bechuanaland Mining Company backed by Rothschild money.The latter company was a cartel that arbitrarily extended its mandate toMashonaland and, like Rhodes, it announced plans to build a railway to theZambezi.Fortunately – and for reasons that were possibly pecuniary – Robinson remainedon Rhodes’s side. He treated other Mashonaland claimants coolly, and wasnoncommittal when the Bechuanaland Mining Company made a play for his support.He went so far as to send Moffat back to Bulawayo ‘to prevent Lo Bengula frommaking any more promises or concessions of any kind except such as may beexpressly sanctioned by the High Commissioner’.The Secret Society was also brought into the Game. Sidney Shippard, resplendentin his high-commissioner uniform and accompanied by a military escort, divertedhis entourage in order to impress Lobengula on Rhodes’s behalf. Throughout thistricky period Shippard worked diligently behind the scenes for Rhodes,responding to the clear yet subtle appeal in his cable: ‘If you can give me anyhelp, without of course in any way committing yourself.’ Rhodes confirmed thathis plan had not deviated from the one he had outlined in the Confession ofFaith:2 [part0037.html#ch9fn-2] ‘My plan is to give the chief whatever hedesires and also offer H.M. Government the whole expense of good government. Ifwe get Matabeleland we shall get the balance of Africa. I do not stop in myideas at the Zambezi.’3 [part0037.html#ch9fn-3]This correspondence may also be read as a rallying call to the troops. Indeed,Rhodes wrote gaily to young Francis Newton, a deputy commissioner forBechuanaland who was answerable both to Robinson and to Shippard: ‘I am awfullyrestless that I cannot get to run my hobby in Matabeleland.’ Regarding thelatter, Rotberg astutely observes: ‘For “hobby,” read dream of a band ofbrothers ordered along Jesuit lines for the extension of the Empire and thespread of good government as well as the glorification of Rhodes’ – a clearreference to the Secret Society.Rhodes’s comment to Shippard that he would give Lobengula ‘whatever he desires’is particularly revealing. Rhodes already knew what Lobengula might request:modern weapons and ammunition. But for a member of the Cape Parliament, the saleof firearms to natives – cross-border, no less – was completely illegal,especially with the connivance of a senior British official. This should havecost both of them their jobs.This was clearly a society that acted in whatever manner it chose to, with fewconcerns about the morality of its deeds. Giving Lobengula firearms andammunition was tantamount to condoning widespread slaughter. Rhodes would haveknown it had taken just 120 modern rifles to mow down more than a thousand Zulusat Rorke’s Drift. He was not, however, short of henchmen to carry out his dirtywork, and this time he took no chances. The team he sent to Bulawayo – Rudd,Maguire and the interpreter Francis Thompson – was accompanied by an entourageof civil servants, guides, cooks, servants and drivers, who were all carryingSir Hercules Robinson’s semi-official British declaration of support forLobengula.This high-powered team was made to wait in a rough camp in Lobengula’s goatkraal while he engaged in activities that included drinking (champagne was hisfavourite tipple) and spending long hours with his concubines, one of whom was alegendary Griqua beauty. Rudd, who had several businesses to run, threatened toquit. The situation was saved when Shippard arrived with two trustedmissionaries. No record exists of their exchanges with Lobengula, but shortlyafter Shippard’s departure, the long-awaited concession was granted – theso-called Rudd Concession. It is more than likely that Shippard simply carriedout Rhodes’s orders, giving the chief whatever he desired.Whatever the case, Rhodes himself did very well from the deal. Lobengula gaveRhodes ‘exclusive charge over all his metals and minerals’, coupled with theright to expel ‘all other claimants to land, metals, minerals or mining rights’.* * *At Churchill High School we learnt the terms of the Rudd Concession almost byheart. No other document so justified our presence on African soil as that pieceof paper, and I, for one, never questioned its terms. We were, I soon came torealise, the last generation of whites to rule an African country according toprinciples established in Victorian times – even though the Victorians and theirconventions were long gone. Settled there by virtue of Rhodes’s scheme, stillliving by the rules, and in accordance with the aims of his Secret Society, webelieved we were destined to spread British civilisation, thereby bringing peaceto the world.Some years later, when I first wrote about the Rudd Concession in anautobiographical account of my family’s overland journey to Africa,4[part0037.html#ch9fn-4] I came to see the concession for what it was. Rhodesclaimed the concession gave him the right to conquer and rule Mashonaland, andto do so wisely and well, in accordance with the writings of Marcus Aurelius.But the Rudd Concession was, in fact, no more than a mining licence based on anillegal payment. Lobengula had, as expected, demanded weapons in return for thefavour: rifles, 100,000 cartridges, and a gunboat on the Zambezi.Nor did Rhodes allow the Cape’s laws banning the cross-border sale of arms toAfricans to get in his way – even though he was prime minister by then. Hesolved the matter quite simply, by using the Secret Society: two of his closestcronies, Rutherfoord Harris and Frank Johnson, with the complicity of Shippard,smuggled the weapons from Cape Town to the mine store at De Beers Consolidatedin Kimberley, whence they were taken across the Bechuanaland border to Bulawayo.This operation took some weeks, though by then Lobengula had been warned off theRudd Concession by other concession-seekers. He locked the weapons andammunition away in a storeroom, refusing ever to touch them, and publicly deniedthe concession in a notice published both in the British Bechuanaland GovernmentGazette and the Bechuanaland News. Lobengula also wrote to Queen Victoria,requesting her to protect him from Rhodes, who, he said, wanted to ‘eat’ hiscountry; at the same time, Lobengula dispatched two of his senior indunas toLondon. The African king’s diplomatic skills took Rhodes by surprise. He wasshocked when the frock-coated Matabele warriors were feted in London, and theAboriginal Society enthusiastically espoused their cause.Queen Victoria responded by clearly distancing herself from all suchconcessions: ‘The Queen wishes Lobengula to understand distinctly that theEnglishmen who have gone out to Matabeleland to ask leave to dig for stones havenot gone with the Queen’s authority, and he should not believe any statementsmade by them, or any of them to that effect.’ The Queen’s letter went on: ‘Aking gives a stranger an ox, not his whole herd of cattle, otherwise what wouldother strangers have to eat.’This letter is one of the mysteries of Victoria’s reign. It suggests that theQueen realised she had been deceived by Rhodes and senior British ministers likeSir Hercules Robinson – which was quite likely – and was now seeking to redressthese wrongs. She assured Lobengula that someone would be sent to set mattersright, but Lobengula, by now wary of British officials, replied: ‘I have notasked the Queen to send anyone to me.’ This was a severe misjudgement on thepart of the Matabele king, for there was no more mention of royal intercession,and within weeks the British South Africa Company had its royal charter.As soon as Lobengula, who could neither read nor write, had applied histhumbprint to the concession document, Rudd immediately left for Cape Town.There then occurs a remarkable event which might quite easily have changed thecourse of African history. On his way to the Cape, Rudd stopped at an oasis inBechuanaland called Lemoen Pond, which turned out to be dry. A note fixed to athorn tree said that there was water two miles away, but in searching for itRudd became hopelessly lost in the bush. Convinced he would not last the night,he deposited the concession, his money bag and a farewell letter to his wife inan antbear hole. Wandering around in the dark, he heard the barking of dogs andfound their Tswana owners camped nearby. They gave him some water, and he wasable to recover his possessions. To make up time, he jumped onto his mule-drawnwagon and made a gruelling journey through the night: ‘We drove on through thenight in stretches of two hours with one and a half hour intervals.’ Two dayslater, an exhausted Rudd drove into Kimberley and handed the concession toRhodes. This was a record for the distance which would not be broken until therailhead was extended to Bulawayo.In the meantime Lobengula, having denied the Rudd Concession almost as soon asthe euphoria of Dr Jim’s morphine shots wore off, vented his growing rage onMaguire and Thompson. Things took an extremely nasty turn when Lobengula gave anorder for the induna who had advised him to sign the concession to be clubbed todeath in front of the two Englishmen. Unsurprisingly, Maguire left immediately,and Thompson fled soon afterwards when an induna warned him that Lobengula wasnow in a killing mood and he could be next. Rhodes had boarded a ship forEngland, determined to convert the concession into a royal charter. He cabledthe intrepid Jameson, telling him to return to Bulawayo to placate the enragedKing with a delivery of more guns and ammunition. Jameson duly went back to theKing’s kraal, telling a pain-ridden Lobengula he had gout – quite possible,given the amount of alcohol the King was fed by concession-hunters – andadministered morphine by injection. Jameson’s biographer, Seymour Fort, claimsthat the following conversation then took place:‘Well, king, as you will not confirm your promise and grant me the road, I shallbring my white impi, and if necessary we shall fight,’ said Jameson.Lobengula, stark naked and lying in a darkened hut, replied, ‘I have neverrefused the road to you and your impi.’‘Very well,’ said Jameson, ‘Then you acknowledge that you have promised to grantme the road; and unless you refuse to do it now, your promise holds good.’At this, the King remained ‘diplomatically silent’, according to Fort, withJameson quickly taking his leave.‘Then goodbye, chief; you have given me your promise about the road, and on thestrength of that promise, I shall bring in my impi to Mashonaland.’This strange exchange has all the signs of coercion, yet to Rhodes it seemedperfectly fine. Some years later, Rhodes would say of Jameson: ‘I am moreindebted to him than to any man in South Africa’ – this despite the ill-fatedraid that not only destroyed Rhodes’s political career in 1896, but also hisdream of a federated Africa.* * *Lord Salisbury had approved a similar charter deal for the Imperial British EastAfrica Company (IBEAC) in 1888. A private share-based company, the IBEAC was‘licensed’ to exploit on behalf of the Crown an area located north ofKilimanjaro and east of Lake Victoria. Correctly assuming that this could be aprecedent for the Mashonaland charter, Rhodes approached Lord Salisbury. Heargued that, if – at no expense to the Crown and with little political risk toBritain – the Queen granted him a charter for a share-based British South AfricaCompany, she would gain another piece of Empire.Word came back from Lord Salisbury that if Rhodes could satisfy Her Majesty thathis concession with Lobengula was rock-solid, a charter might be granted.However, because he had been several weeks at sea, Rhodes had heard nothing ofLobengula’s letter to the Queen, let alone her reply, which obviously came as ashock to him. He then sought out the colonial secretary, Lord Knutsford, andclaimed that the Grobler treaty was unwitnessed and therefore fraudulent, quitelikely the work of disgruntled concession-seekers at Lobengula’s court, and hebegged Lord Knutsford to amend the Queen’s reply. Knutsford refused, pointingout that no one dared tamper with this monarch’s mail.Rhodes was now desperate. And at about this time there was an incident which,had it gone public, would certainly have destroyed his reputation in England.Two new well-connected English concession-seekers, Alfred W. Haggard, brother ofH. Rider Haggard, and John Fellowes Wallop, son of Lord Portsmouth, wereprevented from reaching Bulawayo by a Matabele war party led by none other thanMaguire. In the tense exchange which followed, Maguire came to an arrangementwith the concession-seekers. Alfred Haggard later joined Rhodes’s British SouthAfrica Company.In London, Rhodes sought out E.A. Maund, who had been tasked with deliveringQueen Victoria’s letter to Lobengula. He asked him – with a financialinducement, no doubt – to ‘lose’ the letter on the voyage. Maund refused,pointing out that the Aboriginal Society had anticipated Rhodes’s skulduggeryand sent a copy of the Queen’s letter by another route. Maund did, however,agree to do his best to delay the arrival of the letter in Bulawayo. He was trueto his word – and it took months before Victoria’s reply landed in Lobengula’shands.In the meantime, what Rhodes referred to as the ‘Imperial Factor’ had begun tofavour him. There even seemed to be a touch of ‘divine’ intervention when LordSalisbury came under extraordinary pressure from the heirs to DavidLivingstone’s missionary empire in the country known today as Malawi. Thesepowerful Scottish peers, driven by the London Missionary Society and theWesleyan Methodist Society, and egged on by W.T. Stead’s Secret Society-fundedPall Mall Gazette, were nagging the British prime minister to annex Nyasaland,5[part0037.html#ch9fn-5] where Livingstone had set up a string of remote Churchof Scotland mission stations. For Lord Salisbury, the political dangersrepresented by this group were considerably more pressing than those posed byCecil Rhodes in Mashonaland.Lord Salisbury, an eminently practical man, thought he saw a solution. TwoAfrican birds could be brought down with one stone and at little political orfinancial cost to the British government. Those in the know – includingKnutsford, Salisbury and Milner – were fully aware that Rhodes had his sightsset on much more than Mashonaland. Indeed, the deal that finally emerged tradedMashonaland and neighbouring Nyasaland for a royal charter. Sir HerculesRobinson had also lined up closely with Rhodes. Robinson had studied the RuddConcession in Cape Town and then forwarded it to the Colonial Office with thecommendation: ‘It will check the inroad of adventurers … [and] secure thecautious development of the country with a proper consideration for the feelingsand prejudices of the natives.’ These pro-Rhodes epistles would cost Robinsonhis job. Some months later, when allegations began to circulate that he was onRhodes’s secret payroll, Robinson was recalled to London and replaced as highcommissioner. It also emerged that John Rudd, never more than a business partnerof Rhodes, may have been ignorant of Rhodes’s intention to widen the terms ofthe Rudd Concession, suggesting he was not party to the machinations of theSecret Society. Rhodes had in fact written to Shippard, warning him to becareful of Rudd: ‘I am quite aware you cannot act freely with him … Though hedoes not know our big ideas he will try and obtain what he desires for ourcompanies [De Beers and Gold Fields] whose trust deed I shall use for theobjects I have in view.’ The use of the pronoun ‘our’ is significant: Shippardwas a member of the Secret Society.Subsequent correspondence from Francis Newton – Shippard’s deputy inBechuanaland – further confirms the possibility that the Secret Society formedin Kimberley was by now larger and more active than has ever before beenacknowledged. Sir Hercules Robinson and Sidney Shippard (soon to be knighted)were among the most senior civil servants at the Cape, and Newton’s word wouldhave carried great authority in Bechuanaland. Writing to Moffat, Newton enthusedabout Rhodes: ‘We put him on a pedestal. We would have done anything for him.’6[part0037.html#ch9fn-6]By now, Frederick Selous, who had agreed to scout for the Pioneer Column, hadfound a ‘providential’ pass into the high, verdant savannah that would soonbecome Rhodesia. With its fertile soil, its copper, silver and zinc deposits,the country was ripe for agricultural and mining development – a place ofpromise where, sixty years on, my own family would settle. Selous rejectedearlier plans that called for an attack on Lobengula, and worked out analternative route which avoided upwards of 10,000 Matabele warriors eager to wettheir spears. Come the day, 1 July 1890, Lobengula hesitated, and his army heldback while Selous’s small band scurried across Matabeleland. Rhodes had squaredthe white queen, and now he had outmanoeuvred the black king."},{"pageContent":"10The Selling of OphirIn the summer of 1889, on the strength of his newfound fame and fortune, Rhodesattended a supper party – an event noted only in passing by a few biographers.John Verschoyle’s guests included Henry Hamilton Johnston (later Sir Harry),Walter Pater and Frank Harris, and it is only in examining who in fact thesepeople were that the extraordinary nature of this soirée becomes apparent.Johnston, a small-built man who never married – he was later nicknamed ‘LittleJohnston’ by Rhodes’s circle – was energetic, pushy and a keen imperialist. ABritish agent engaged in the Great Game in various parts of Africa, he was alsoa respected explorer, travelling for a time with Henry Morton Stanley. He hadconsiderable experience in African states, and had gained a reputation fordiplomatic work, having been active in Nigeria where he used gunboat diplomacyto persuade merchant kings like Jaja of Opobo to accept British hegemony.Walter Pater was a foppish professor at Oxford during Rhodes’s time,instrumental in establishing the aesthetic movement in Victorian England. Famousaesthetes included Harold Acton (said to be the model for the effete AnthonyBlanche in Evelyn Waugh’s Brideshead Revisited) and Oscar Wilde. In this contextthe term ‘aesthete’ was often synonymous with ‘homosexual’.Frank Harris was the most libidinous writer of the age, famous for hisautobiographical My Life and Loves in which he confesses – somewhat dubiously –to having indulged in every sexual deviation known to man. He was a witness forthe defence at Oscar Wilde’s sodomy trial. In keeping with his reputation,Harris was one of few friends ever to comment on Rhodes’s homosexuality,claiming one of Rhodes’s secretaries had mentioned his ‘erotic tendencies’ anddrawn comparisons with Oscar Wilde.Verschoyle himself was described by Johnston as a ‘strange character; young,rather good-looking, very blond and grey-eyed a curate of such broad theologythat all the strait [sic] Christian doctrines seemed to have slipped through themeshes of his mind’. The unorthodox Verschoyle was also a political fixer, andtherefore a useful contact.Rhodes and Johnston talked until midnight before moving on to the WestminsterPalace Hotel, where, in Rhodes’s suite, they continued their conversation untildawn. Johnston later recorded: ‘We settled as we thought the immediate line ofaction in South and Central Africa. I jotted down on paper the heads of a schemeI was to propose to Lord Salisbury.’ Rhodes then gave Johnston the relativelylarge sum of £2,000 for a scouting expedition beyond the Zambezi River intoKatanga (Congo), and promised him £10,000 (more than £1 million in today’scurrency) for the occupation and administration of the huge area extendingacross central Africa from the Zambezi to the White Nile. This exchange revealsthat, twelve years after writing it, Rhodes was still actively pursuing thegrand plan outlined in his 1877 Confession – a plan he admitted was insane:‘When the thought came to get through the continent, it was a mad thought, itwas the idea of a lunatic … But it is now not a question of the lunacy of theproject; it is merely a question of the years it will take to complete.’* * *W.T. Stead, just four years Rhodes’s senior, came from a background remarkablysimilar to that of Rhodes. The son of a Congregationalist minister in the northof England, William Thomas had only two years of formal schooling. This provedno obstacle, and in 1871, at the age of twenty-two, when Rhodes was starting tomake his fortune and had just entered Oxford, Stead became the youngest editorin England when he took over the Northern Echo in Darlington. Pioneeringinvestigative journalism, he went on to edit some of the greatest newspapers inthe land and established a network of foreign agents who helped to serve Britishpolitical interests. These agents also served Rhodes’s Secret Society when iteventually fell under Stead’s control, and in one case actually used bogusinformation to change official British policy. Apart from all this, Rhodes hadlittle in common with Stead, a married man and serial philanderer1[part0037.html#ch10fn-1] who disapproved of homosexuality.Before Stead’s time, newspapers were divided into two distinct categories: the‘dreadfuls’, which cost a penny and were little more than entertainment sheets,and the ‘thunderers’, which reported on politics, finance and internationalnews. The masses – those at least who were literate – read the penny dreadfuls,while the educated elite read thunderers like The Times.In 1880 Stead moved to London to assist John Morley in editing the Pall MallGazette. The newspaper’s critics accused it of practising ‘yellow journalism’and Stead himself of being a sensationalist, a crusader and a didact – though bytoday’s standards Stead would probably be regarded as a serious journalist. Hewas a committed imperialist, an active member of the Aboriginal Society, and achampion of women’s rights. The Pall Mall Gazette adapted to meet therequirements of a rapidly evolving Victorian middle class. It carriedinterviews, many conducted by Stead himself, when most other papers stuck toreporting and editorialising. (The Gazette was a forerunner of today’s EveningStandard, whose readership is still egalitarian.)The late nineteenth century was an era when a ‘foreign’ editor of a Britishnewspaper, i.e. a correspondent based abroad, could also expect to be asked toact as a foreign agent – in other words, a spy. These correspondents – and Steadwas no exception – recruited networks of foreign correspondents/agents, thePrincess Radziwill being a classic example. The Princess’s actions rival thoseof Mata Hari on the European political stage, and there is increasing evidencethat she was also a key agent in South Africa. Stead’s relationship withPrincess Radziwill dates from the time he had written a series of articlesopposing the Bulgarian atrocities of 1876–78, thereby helping to alter England’sposition in regard to Russia. Gladstone, Stead’s confidant, had enlisted theassistance of the influential newspaper editor.In 1881 Stead recruited an assistant editor – a young man who had given up lawafter being called to the bar. His name was Alfred Milner, and he was anintellectual prodigy. Like Rhodes, he was twenty-seven years old and also apassionate imperialist. It remains a mystery why this brilliant young academicbecame interested in yellow journalism. Milner had won the Hertford, Craven,Eldon and Derby scholarships, and finished with a Double First in classics fromBalliol College. He was certain of a brilliant diplomatic career (which he laterachieved) and would have done equally well in the law. Neither career, however,would have provided the appointment with destiny that Stead offered: eventually,Milner would follow Stead in running Rhodes’s Secret Society, transforming itinto a clandestine power elite that came close to controlling global politics –as the chapters that follow reveal.There is a surprisingly simple if little-known explanation for the attractionbetween this apparently disparate pair. Stead championed virtually every goodcause of the day, with his main focus being always the poor and the powerless.The man who would become Alfred, the Lord Milner, second only to Prime MinisterDavid Lloyd George in the administration of Britain, was at heart likewise achampion of the poor. At Oxford Milner had formed a close friendship with youngArnold Toynbee, writing a paper on the historian’s theories of social work and,in 1895, twelve years after Toynbee’s death at the age of thirty, penning atribute, Arnold Toynbee: A Reminiscence. An admirer of Ruskin, Milner joined hisgroup to build a road for the poor of Oxford. He was clearly a committedimperialist in the classic Ruskin tradition – far more so than even Rhodes was.* * *Rhodes had sought out W.T. Stead on an earlier trip to London in 1885. He failedin that attempt because Stead was in Holloway Prison (Milner was running thepaper in his absence). The tale behind this testifies to the strength of Stead’sideals and the new journalism he had introduced to the British media. The courthad accused him of using unlawful investigative methods in his exposé of childprostitution, a series of articles called The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon.Stead dealt in sensationalism. With the help of Bramwell Booth of the SalvationArmy, Stead’s staffers made contact with one-time brothel-keeper Rebecca Jarrettwho was acquainted with an alcoholic mother who was willing to sell her teenageddaughter, Eliza. The mother agreed to sell Eliza – ostensibly into service – for£5. After having her virginity confirmed by a midwife, Eliza was taken to abrothel and lightly drugged to await the arrival of her new ‘employer’ – noother than W.T. Stead himself! The ensuing melodrama was narrated in luriddetail, with Stead in the role of libidinous seducer who enters the druggedvirgin’s room and waits until she awakens – whereupon the girl screams andimmediately flees. Eliza is quickly handed over to the protective custody ofBramwell Booth, who spirits her away to France, where she is put under the careof a Salvationist family.On Saturday 4 July 1885, the Pall Mall Gazette issued a ‘frank warning’ to itsreaders:All those who are squeamish, and all those who are prudish, and all those whowould prefer to live in a fool’s paradise of imaginary innocence and purity,selfishly oblivious to the horrible realities which torment those whose livesare passed in the London inferno, will do well not to read the Pall Mall Gazetteof Monday and the three following days.Needless to say, the newspaper flew off the newsstands, and by the end of theseries the Gazette had generated a public furore against child prostitution, somuch so that the home secretary, Sir William Harcourt, fearing riots on anational scale, appealed to Stead to cease publication. Stead, however, ran hispresses until the machines ran out of paper.I remember the anguish and excitement of times like these when the primeminister decided to censor my own paper, the Rhodesia Herald. Ian Smith bannedthe publication of any news likely to produce ‘alarm and/or despondency’ (whichour editor pointed out covered items as mundane as a drought-affected tobaccocrop). The Herald responded by removing, before the presses ran, the typeface ofcensored items – which resulted in a front page filled with large blocks ofdamning white spaces. We got away with it for a couple of months, and thoroughlyenjoyed our moment of martyrdom!* * *W.T. Stead was tried for procuring a teenage prostitute, which legally speakinghe had done, and was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment. The Pall MallGazette printed a large picture of him in his striped prison uniform. He spentthree days in Coldbath Fields Prison and served the rest of his sentence atHolloway, where he was a first-class inmate.Contrary to the assumptions of most biographers, Rhodes did not seek Stead outat this time to pay homage to his moral fibre. Rhodes had a far more urgentmotive. The true nature of this mission to Stead could only have been Rhodes’scontinuing commitment to some of the more outrageous details of his Confessionof Faith, in particular the reconstitution of Britain and the United States intoa federal legislature based in England.When Rhodes met Stead four years after his abortive trip to Holloway, he wentproperly prepared – and he also took along his very deep purse. Stead had, inthe meantime, written an article suggesting that Britain and America shouldreform as an alliance for the sake of world peace. Over lunch, Rhodes ‘pouredout the long dammed-up flood of his ideas’ and offered Stead about £2 million intoday’s money for a stake in the Gazette or in any other publication to beedited by Stead to promote their ideas. He also, Stead reports, ‘spoke loftilyof underpinning the Empire by a society which would be to the Empire what theSociety of Jesus was to the Papacy’.This meeting took place in the summer of 1889, a month before Rhodes attendedVerschoyle’s soirée, and is proof that Rhodes had kept the original conditionsof the Confession of Faith, right down to the detail of the ‘Society of Jesus’,in the forefront of his mind. Stead may even have set up the dinner withVerschoyle, although the dubious vicar was famous for ‘giving large dinners orsmall and cosy ones’ and – again according to Harry Johnston – for ‘workingdesperately hard as an Imperialist’. Johnston himself had that same year writtenan article in The Times calling for an end to Britain’s ‘magnificent inactivity’in the scramble for Africa. He pleaded that Britain should consolidate itsterritories in southern Africa with its East African mandates, as well as theadministered countries of Egyptian Sudan and Egypt itself, into a ‘continuousband of British dominion’. Little Johnston should thus probably be credited withthe very large Cape-to-Cairo dream which was always associated with Rhodes.* * *As soon as Rhodes left, Stead wrote to his wife: ‘Mr Rhodes is my man!’ And hewas. Rhodes remained true to the instinct which had earlier made Sidney Shippardand Neville Pickering his wealthy beneficiaries by appointing Stead executor ofhis fourth will before the year was over. Rhodes ensured the continuation of theSecret Society by entrusting it to yet another individual he regarded as a manof principle, while Stead in turn gave Rhodes the contacts he needed among thepolitically influential elite of Britain.Stead claimed that Rhodes’s ‘brooding in intellectual solitude in the midst ofthe diamond diggers’ had found in the Gazette ‘the crude ideas which he hadembodied in his first will’, by which he meant their shared passion for anAnglo-American union. There was in fact a slightly earlier third will, which theStead will replaced. Following Pickering’s death, Rhodes had handwritten thisthird will in the De Beers London office. This hurried will was perhaps the mostpeculiar of Rhodes’s many wills in that he left his estate to the banker NathanRothschild, who was also the executor. A less-needy beneficiary it would havebeen hard to find, but the significance of the document lies in the fact that itsignals Rothschild’s involvement in Secret Society business. Indeed, a letterattached to the will specifically instructed the banker to use Rhodes’s fortuneto endow a British secret society.Rhodes instructed Rothschild in cryptic shorthand to establish a ‘Society of theElect for the good of the empire. In considering question suggested, takeConstitution of Jesuits if obtainable and insert English Empire for RomanCatholic Religion.’ This is the first known mention of the name of the societyStead would later create in Britain. The most important element of thisshort-lived will is its date: June 1888. Rhodes was thirty-five years old, andit was eleven years since he had penned his Confession of Faith. It is clearlyincontestable that he was throughout his life guided by the beliefs expressed inthe Confession. In its all but identical guises, the Society of the Electstrongly influenced the final decade of Rhodes’s life, and he took extraordinarymeasures to ensure its continuance beyond the grave.* * *With the Secret Society secure, his relationship cemented with an influentialnewspaper editor, and his expansion plans beyond the Zambezi safe in the handsof Johnston, Rhodes set about winning the big prize: Queen Victoria’s signatureon a charter for his British South Africa Company.The charter was the pièce de résistance of a mastermind for whom fair dealingswith African leaders was not a consideration. Rhodes took a dubious miningconcession which the illiterate Lobengula – unlikely to have understood itsterms – had marked with his thumbprint, and turned it into a right to rule acountry larger than Germany, backed by the military might of the Empire. He hadgone into this ‘game’ with nothing much in his hands, only to emerge on 29October 1889 with a royal warrant to conquer, occupy and administersouth-central Africa – and it had been issued by a queen who genuinely dislikedand distrusted him.Back in Cape Town, pinned down by bad weather, Rhodes had to wait while Selousmade his dash into Mashonaland, cutting through bush, kopjes and swamps until,two and a half months later, Selous and the Pioneer Column arrived safely attheir destination. Some have speculated that the survival of the column wasthanks to their steam-driven searchlight whose ice-white beam the Matabelefeared might kill them; or that Lobengula had mistaken the column with its smallnumber of men for a merely diversionary force. Whatever the truth, there isevidence to suggest that Lobengula – with his apparent liking for champagne andopium – did actually keep his word to Jameson.When, a year later, Rhodes returned to England, it was as a hero of Empire –rivalling even Gordon and Clive of India. All doors opened to him, includingthat of the palace. Rhodes famously had no clothes suitable for the royalreception. Equally famously, when asked by Victoria whether it was true he hatedwomen, he responded: ‘How can I hate a sex to which your Majesty belongs?’ Whenthe Queen asked: ‘What are you engaged in at present, Mr Rhodes?’ his reply wasless glib: ‘I am doing my best to enlarge your Majesty’s dominions.’Some years later, Harry Johnston wrote of his secret meeting with Rhodes at theWestminster Palace Hotel:Rhodes was the direct means of saving for the British Empire all the territoriesstretching between the north of the Transvaal and the basin of the Congo, inaddition to having given a valuable impetus to the growing idea among theBritish people that we should not abandon our control of Egypt, but that weshould seek to open up a continuous chain of Empire from the Cape to Cairo.The real nature of the business between Johnston and Rhodes was a hugelyambitious imperial scheme."},{"pageContent":"11The Queen’s GiftThe royal charter of 1889 was far more extensive than what Rhodes had originallyrequested: it gave him the right to acquire unlimited ‘heathen’ lands on thesame terms as were granted to a much earlier adventurer, Sir Walter Raleigh.‘Raleigh was Rhodes’s spiritual ancestor,’ writes Sarah Gertrude Millin, whopoints out that Raleigh was also an Oriel man. ‘He had received a patent tocolonise, to trade, to mine in lands that were not Christian.’Rhodes’s mandate stretched from the region to the north of British Bechuanaland,to the north and east of the Boer republics, and to the west of the Portuguesedominions. The omission to define borders to the north and west, and the vaguereference to the eastern boundary bordering Mozambique was deliberate. In anutshell, whatever Rhodes could take he could keep, as long as it was heathenterritory and unclaimed.It soon became clear that that was what Rhodes intended to do – indeed, thevoice of the imperialist rings loudly from speeches to the Cape Parliament andalso from his letters at this time: ‘I would abolish the system of independentstates antagonistic to us south of the Zambesi’; ‘If you were to sleep for fiveand twenty years, you might find a gentleman called your prime minister sittingin Cape Town and controlling the whole, not only to the Zambesi but to LakeTanganyika’; ‘I will stop where the country has not yet been claimed.’ In onefell swoop Rhodes had become the Colossus – and there was no holding him back:‘I can state to you that I shall never abandon my object. You can accept from metonight what I think now, and what I thought nine years ago, shall be my thoughtin the future.’A stream of influential British aristocrats, lured by cheap share options, wererecruited by Rhodes to serve as directors of the chartered British South AfricaCompany. The company chairman was the Duke of Abercorn, with the Duke of Fifevice-chairman; and perhaps most significantly, Albert Grey – later Earl Grey,arguably Britain’s most respected politician – agreed to join the board. LordRupert Cecil, Salisbury’s son, was appointed legal counsel, while a handful ofexperienced Rhodes acolytes, including Alfred Beit, did the real work. In aquick sleight of hand, Rhodes attempted to vest ownership of the charter in ashell company, thereby limiting liability, but the British government spottedthe ruse and Rhodes was made to sell the charter back to the BSAC. In theprocess, however, Rhodes’s cronies had managed to make a fair profit.At the same time, to the mystification of even his closest friends, Rhodesembarked on a dubious venture – one that did not elude the attention of John X.Merriman, one of his few critics in the Cape Parliament. Rhodes’s ambitions had,it seemed, been severely underrated. It came to light that in 1891 Rhodes metsecretly with the Irish nationalist leader, Charles Stewart Parnell, offeringhim the extravagant sum of £10,000 if he reversed a key policy of his IrishParty. Parnell held key seats in the British Parliament and his rallying crywas: ‘None of us whether we be in America or in Ireland … will be satisfieduntil we have destroyed the last link which keeps Ireland bound to England.’1[part0037.html#ch11fn-1] A militant advocate of home rule for Ireland, Parnellhad resolved, if necessary, to bring down the British Parliament. Rhodes’smeeting with this dangerous political adversary clearly threatened his relationswith the prime minister and the Queen. Merriman concluded from this that Rhodeswas trying to buy an ‘Irish’ seat in Parliament because a man with an Oxforddegree and a seat in the British Parliament was more likely to be trusted with aroyal charter than a ‘pro-Boer Cape politician’.2 [part0037.html#ch11fn-2] Orperhaps this was Rhodes’s first move in a Secret Society takeover of the BritishParliament? Merriman was, however, wrong on both counts.Driven by his master plan, Rhodes was after something far more ambitious.Parnell and his followers, with seats in both the Irish and the Britishparliaments, constituted a model for the imperial federation that Rhodes sodesired. Parnell’s politicians had held the balance in the British House ofCommons for many years, toppling and then reforming both Conservative andLiberal regimes. Gladstone and Salisbury were forced to play musical chairs toParnell’s tune. And now, for £10,000, Rhodes hoped he might call that tune!The previous year, in 1890, Rhodes had met J.G.S. ‘Swifty’ MacNeill, afundraiser for Parnell who also held an Irish seat in the English Parliament. Atdinner, MacNeill made a pitch for his party and Rhodes stunned him byimmediately offering him £10,000 – the largest private contribution ever made tothe party. When MacNeill heard what Rhodes wanted in return, he was even morestunned. Charles Parnell could earn this cash – Rhodes handed over £5,000 of itin £100 notes there and then – if the Irish Party pursued a form of home rulethat did not give up the Irish seats at Westminster; in other words, the exactopposite of what Parnell, champion of an independent Ireland, was demanding.They were still negotiating when the Parnell ‘squaring’ leaked – as thingsturned out, John X. Merriman had also been approached for funds by MacNeill.‘What is Rhodes about?’ a bewildered Merriman enquired of Rhodes’s secretary,Harry Currey. ‘What is his objective in tying himself up with this set of Irishmiscreants who are trying to ruin England and break up the Empire?’ In the wakeof this revelation, Rhodes was obliged to appear before his constituents atBarkly West to explain himself: ‘I have been told that my object is to obtain aseat in the British Parliament. There is no truth in this … I have not theslightest idea of quitting South Africa for any other country,’ he reassuredthem.This entire episode may demonstrate that Rhodes was merely seeking to preservethe core principle of his Confession of Faith, namely that a dominion/colony(which is what he perceived Ireland to be) could have its own parliament inaddition to having representatives in the mother house – together constitutingthe federated government of the British Empire. Yet it is possible that Merrimanmay have had a point. After all, the Irish Party did eventually present Rhodes’sfriend, Maguire – whose actions had prevented concession-seekers from reachingLobengula’s kraal – with a safe seat in the British Parliament, which in turnprovided the Secret Society with a foot in the door of the home parliament. Inthe event, the Parnell affair came to nothing, other than possibly inspiringRhodes’s most famous bon mot. Having heard from Stead about Parnell’sillegitimate offspring and the ensuing fury of the Roman Catholic Church, he isalleged to have said to Parnell: ‘Can’t we square the Pope?’3[part0037.html#ch11fn-3]By this time, however, Rhodes had more important things on his mind, just one ofwhich was his aim of becoming prime minister of the Cape. The new highcommissioner, Sir Henry Loch, had not welcomed his candidature, and nor hadMerriman. Rhodes himself asked Jan Hofmeyr to take on the position; Hofmeyrrefused, though he did say that he would serve in Rhodes’s cabinet. In hiselection speeches Rhodes made it clear that if the country wanted him to serve,it had to accept a new future: ‘I believe in a united South Africa, but as aportion of the British Empire … We should state by our policy that we areprepared to take the administration right through to the Zambesi … I wouldabolish the system of independent states antagonistic to ourselves, south of theZambesi.’ That meant the Boer republics, as well as the territories of theMatabele and the Shona.Rhodes went on to win the election, and willy-nilly South Africa becameimplicated in the pursuit of the aims of the Secret Society. As we have seen,however, Rhodes had set about its business before he was installed as primeminister. As Sarah Gertrude Millin records, ‘Lord Knutsford had not yet dippedpen in ink to tell Lobengula of the charter when the twelve young men, known asRhodes’s Apostles, were sent northwards to spy out the land and preparethemselves for escorting a Pioneer Column.’ He had in any event only been ableto afford 179 ‘pioneers’ and a newly recruited force of British South Africa(BSA) police that included miners and adventurers like H. Rider Haggard andRobert Baden-Powell. Rhodes had tried to join them but had been forced back byflooding rivers and on the orders of Sir Henry Loch, who thought the invasion aridiculous gamble and feared for the life of his new prime minister.For a while it seemed Sir Henry’s doubts were justified. Jameson claimed he hadan agreement with Lobengula that two indunas would come to the border to discussa route selected by Selous. But they failed to turn up. Then came a sarcasticand ominous message from the King: ‘Has the King killed any white men that animpi is collected on his border? Or have the white men lost anything they arelooking for?’ The message implied, of course, that Lobengula wasn’t expectingJameson, and this threw him into a fit of rage. Bristling with anger, he jumpedon his horse and dashed off to Bulawayo where he woke Lobengula and pursued himwhen he sought the sanctuary of his women’s kraal. When Lobengula later emergedhe was surrounded by blood-spattered traditional healers who had sacrificedchickens to rid the kraal of the irate Scot. When Jameson finally cornered theKing he demanded: ‘Was the King lying? He told me I might make that road.’‘The King never lies,’ was Lobengula’s riposte as he turned and walked away.4[part0037.html#ch11fn-4] Significantly, not a single Matabele warrior, all ofwhom were doubtlessly eager to defend their tribe, came within gunshot range ofthe Pioneer Column. Sarah Gertrude Millin gives a vivid account of the onwardjourney to Mashonaland:Lobengula had given his promise of the land and he kept it. Wagons were draggedby rope across streams with crocodiles, they broke on the granite kopjes, theoxen who drew them on the 460 mile trek became thin and weak. Roads were cutthrough marshy timbered valleys. Unaccustomed white faces sweated in the wintersun. Unaccustomed white hands grew calloused by pick and shovel. Scoutspatrolled. Laagers were nightly made. The pilgrimage was a grand idea, it readspectacularly – here was dangerous living! Actually it was so uneventful it wasbeyond anything tedious. The pioneers took a month to reach the lucky passcalled Providential that led to a clear plateau, four thousand feet abovesea-level, and another month to hoist the Union Jack at a spot they namedSalisbury … but no Matabele touched a man, nor was a life lost.* * *When I first arrived in Salisbury it was a pretty little place which myexhausted mother Edith thought had been lowered by God from Heaven. It had alovely white Victorian hotel with wrought-iron balconies manufactured inBirmingham which the locals called ‘broekie (knicker) lace’, two cinemas, theGrand and the Palace, and a smart department store, Barbours, where my mothersoon found a job as a fashion buyer.We had arrived, after the scary electrical storm of the previous night, atMeikles Hotel in the early hours of the morning of 19 November 1947 and bookedstraight into large, airy rooms with crisp linen sheets. I remember sleepinglike a log until a fierce shaft of sunlight awoke me and I went in search of mymother to check that this was still Africa.I found her sitting in a white basket-chair on the balcony, staring open-mouthedat my father Len who was emerging burdened with flowers from a little parkacross the road called Cecil Square. He bounced jauntily into their bedroom andscattered the flowers. My mother’s smile was radiant. For the first time inmonths, she felt secure – and all compliments of Mr Rhodes!‘This is where we’re going to make our new life,’ my mother said. ‘We’restopping here.’ I knew from the tone of her voice that the journey I had neverwanted to end had ended. My mother loved Mashonaland. It is a high and airyplace of outstanding natural beauty. Two of my children were born there. Myfather is buried there – along with part of my heart. Edith would, I think, havelived forever on that veranda surrounded by those flowers. But Len died agedfifty-six from lung cancer and she was forced to retreat slowly southwards aseach new independence war engulfed her, until, aged ninety-six, in pretty HoutBay in Cape Town, she seemingly became bored with life and took her leave.That day my father scattered flowers around the hotel bedroom I reminded himabout his promise about King Solomon’s mines. ‘Just down the road,’ he said. ‘MrRhodes has got it all tidied up. Picnic tables and barbecue spots.’ We relaxedinto our new life, and at my junior school called David Livingstone we all woretrilby hats and shorts. After an agonising parting with our four-wheel-driveShaky, which my father sold to a farmer at a huge profit, we replaced her with anifty little Morris Minor.Life was so much better than it had been in England. The excitements ofexploring were soon replaced as we became intrepid frontiersmen. My own frontierwas a rocky knoll, a kopje that divided the warriors of Cranborne Camp, the oldair force base housing new arrivals, from those in Arcadia. Far from being anykind of Elysian field, Arcadia was the bleak area the city council had allottedto the ‘Coloured Community’. Beyond Arcadia was the ‘Black Community’ that livedin Harare location. We never spoke about Harare or the living conditions inthese urban slums – all part of Rhodes’s legacy.We had no contact at all with the black community in all the months I lived inCranborne Camp – indeed, contact of any kind was discouraged. Children were alsodiscouraged from talking to the maids and kitchen staff (known as girls andboys, and irrespective of their actual ages), but we were allowed to fight thecoloured boys of our own age for occupation of the kopje. These battles werefairly lethal. Our opponents – mixed race and proud of it – used catapults tofire ball bearings at us. We had an assortment of airguns. As soon as anyone waseven vaguely nicked, or it was time to go home for tea, we went into immediate‘peace talks’ and resumed the battle in the morning.Cranborne Camp was the best place anyone could have invented for a ten-year-oldboy, mainly because it housed dozens of other ten-year-old boys and theiroverlander parents; they were English and Scots mostly, but there were also afair number of Greeks, Jews and Afrikaners. In the evenings the parents met inthe mess hall, boasting about their journeys as they enjoyed their sundowners.Rhodesia had been ‘the frontier’ up until about 1910, and a rural backwaterright through the 1920s and 30s, growing tidy little towns with churches,hospitals and schools – all neatly divided along racial lines. Settlers like ushad mined a few mines, set up a lot of farms, built many famous ‘strip roads’ –two tyre-width strips of tar set in the middle of a clay road. My father hadsettled contentedly into a dull office job. And my Uncle Aubrey had by now comeout to join us and was making his mark on the town, roofing the new SalisburyGeneral Hospital and many suburban houses.Cranborne Camp was tailor-made for us new settlers. Built during the war years,many Brits and a squadron or so of young Rhodesians, including Ian Smith, learnthow to fly Hurricanes and Spitfires there. It was in fact from his mates in theRAF that my father had first heard of ‘Shangri-La’. The Commonwealth Officepromoted Rhodesia as a grand place to settle – my family was exactly what Rhodeshad in mind all those years ago. For a while after the war, the camp stood emptybehind its high barbed-wire fence, home only to millions of spiders, fleas and,above all, cockroaches. The fibreboard walls of the houses in the camp stood onbrick pilings, and the space underneath was a shady snake heaven: black andgreen mambas, Gaboon vipers, puff adders and spitting cobras – even after wemoved in, these were our closest neighbours.The post-war migration of settlers arrived mainly by road and rail, the mostintrepid being overlanders like us who had motored down from the north.Thousands from war-torn Europe descended on sleepy Rhodesia. Armed with Flitpumps, DDT sprays and mosquito coils we moved into Cranborne Camp. Cockroachesscuttled from cracks in the walls, mosquitoes formed themselves into squadrons,and fleas, emulating the old Boer commandos, leapt out from the folds of ourbedding. My brother Peter, just three years old, won instant fame when, at asundowner party, he came in clasping a Flit pump and announced: ‘We’re killingbuggers!’ Peter stayed on in Rhodesia through the death throes of whitesettlement and fought in the guerrilla war.Eventually, my family was given a settler house. It had an asbestos roof thatLen had to go up and paint, suffering almost terminal sunburn in the process. Itwas our home for many happy years.* * *Back in 1891, Rhodes was also building his first real home. As prime minister ofthe Cape, he needed a suitable place for entertaining guests, so he bought ahuge ugly barn which had been built by the Dutch East India Company as a granary(hence the name ‘Groote Schuur’). To remodel it, Rhodes hired a relativelyunknown architect to whom he had taken a fancy at a dinner party – the youngHerbert Baker.5 [part0037.html#ch11fn-5]Baker ripped the front off the building, built a huge stoep at the back, andknocked down the slave quarters, forcing Rhodes, who liked the cool crampedquarters, to decamp into the main house. Together, they then crowded theinterior with vast pieces of furniture – Victorian replicas made of hard darklocal woods. Never possessive about Groote Schuur – or indeed any home he owned– Rhodes allowed Capetonians to wander around the house and surrounding estateat will. Baker built two guest houses, one of which was The Woolsack, to be usedby poets and artists, with the hope that Table Mountain might inspire theirefforts. In the late 1890s Rudyard Kipling used it as his winter home.There is a little-known story about Rhodes and Kipling which is worthy of note.Just over a century ago, a young Englishman, Edgar Wallace, the illegitimate sonof a London actress, decided to take the ‘Queen’s Shilling’ and become asoldier. He was posted to Cape Town where his company commander’s wifeencouraged a hobby unusual in so young a soldier. Wallace wrote poetry in thestyle of Kipling’s ‘Tommy’ poems, one of which was judged good enough to bepublished in the Cape Times. Kipling, en route to The Woolsack for his winterbreak, got word of this. He asked Rhodes to find the young soldier and to invitehim to a reception at the Cape Town Club. Though the club was a good deal moreexclusive than it is today, Rhodes had endowed it handsomely and so his wish wastheir command. The ‘soldier-poet’ was duly found, and in full evening dress and,no doubt, quaking in his boots, was introduced to Kipling at the grand dinner.It was the start of an extraordinary rags-to-riches story that echoed Rhodes’sown.The young Edgar, filled with ambition to be another Kipling, had his appetitewhetted after this meeting, and there was soon no restraining his eagerness.Moreover, as a serving soldier he knew that the Boer War was imminent, so whenhis meeting with Kipling was reported in the Cape Times, he wrote to the LondonDaily Mail and, describing himself as the ‘famous Tommy-poet of Cape Town’,offered to be their war correspondent! The editor of the Mail already had a warcorrespondent – Winston Churchill – but he reasoned astutely that Churchill knewlittle about South Africa and probably had few friends in army ranks. Wallacewas offered the job of assistant war correspondent to Churchill, and having paidthe Queen back her shilling, he mounted his bicycle and rode off to the front!Quite possibly, no better decision has ever been made by an editor. Using hismates as paid informants, Wallace scooped everyone for the next two years.Travelling morning and evening by train past the fenced-off Peace Camp, hesucceeded in breaking news of the peace agreement before it was officiallyannounced – a scoop that had Lord Kitchener calling for his arrest. Behind thebarbed wire, one of Wallace’s friends stood guard, occasionally wiping his facewith his handkerchief. When the peace treaty was signed the guard signalled thisby the colour of his handkerchief, and Wallace was there to spot it.After the war this soldier-poet was appointed founder-editor of the Rand DailyMail and thereafter returned to Britain and various editorships. In a careerthat earned him a fortune, Edgar Wallace wrote 175 novels, 24 plays, andinnumerable articles in newspapers and journals. He died of a heart attack(allegedly in the arms of a young starlet) in 1932 in Hollywood, where he waswriting the script of King Kong. His body was brought back to England on theimmense and stately SS Berengaria which was saluted by the whistles andwaterworks of fireboats on arrival in the Port of London.While Wallace’s link with Rhodes’s Secret Society via Kipling may seem tenuous,there is little doubt that Wallace was a member. His considerable experience ofSouth Africa would have been useful to Rhodes during the difficult period of theBoer War. And he would certainly have known W.T. Stead and Times journalistslike Flora Shaw who acted as clandestine agents for Rhodes.Moreover, it is interesting to examine themes in Wallace’s writing from thisperiod. He wrote twelve Africa-based novels, as well as six thrillers thatformed part of a series called The Four Just Men, the first of which was a hugebestseller. The Four Just Men features a secret vigilante society of foureponymous men who reluctantly threaten to ‘eliminate’ the British foreignsecretary if he tries to ratify an ‘unjust’ law. This is a clear reference toRhodes, Milner, Stead and Brett – ‘vigilantes’ who were committed to theprotection of the Empire, particularly from dubious British foreign secretaries.The fictional four ‘just’ men were, similarly, wealthy political savants.Wallace goes out of his way to present his vigilantes as men of high moral fibreand political acumen. Their secret society is the only way to prevent threats toworld peace.As we shall see, Milner and Brett believed that only they could save the Empirefrom collapse in the first part of the twentieth century. Not even theirsocialist leanings could counter their belief that they were part of anessentially moral ruling class. Milner in particular did not really believe inan unqualified universal franchise – what we now call democracy – and he wascertainly attracted to the idea of ruling through the agency of a secretsociety.So there they all were in Cape Town: Rhodes, Milner, Kipling (also very fond ofspy stories and agents playing the Game on the Afghanistan frontier), Buchan (heof the Thirty-Nine Steps) who was secretary to Milner, and Edgar Wallace, alleulogising The Four Just Men. But while Rhodes was playing host to them, therewas disturbing news from the north. British South Africa Company (or CharterCompany) shares had been floated the moment news reached London that FortSalisbury had been established. In 1899, 5,000 shares were sold and they shot upin value. The young pioneers who had queued up to risk their lives for 7/6d perday were given 3,000 morgen of verdant savannah land apiece. A few weeks later,the first private wagon to drive into Fort Salisbury was weighed down withnothing but whisky. Each pioneer was also given fifteen mining shares. Theprospectors among them walked straight off into the virgin bush, returning,sometimes weeks later, with news of fabulous discoveries. Great Zimbabwe wasmerely the largest of dozens of lost stone cities and settlements, and aroundevery one of them they had found hundreds of ghostly, abandoned gold mines. Whohad opened these ancient shafts was a complete mystery. Not even the localnatives had the vaguest idea who had dug them, and nor did they lay any claim tothem. The problem was, the majority of the mines were worked out.My father had been right: King Solomon’s mines were just down the road – but theGolden Goose seemed to have flown, and there were no more eggs to be found."},{"pageContent":"12Fool’s GoldRhodes and his expanding Secret Society had pulled off one of the mostextraordinary gambles in British imperial history. They had persuaded QueenVictoria, the City of London, the British Parliament as well as eagershareholders of the British South Africa Company that Mashonaland was in factlegendary gold-rich Ophir. But what is truly extraordinary about all this isthat not one ounce of this ancient gold had ever been proven to exist.The early British miners found that the ancient mines they discovered whereverthey found a zimbabwe (stone city) were for the most part empty of gold. ButRhodes ignored all these reports and kept them secret from his shareholders.Instead, in order to continue to lure shareholders and to prove that he had infact discovered King Solomon’s mines, in 1891 he funded an expedition to GreatZimbabwe by the Royal Geographical Society (RGS). This expedition was led byTheodore Bent, a prestigious antiquarian and a considerable field expert on thePhoenicians. Among their first finds were ingot moulds and forges for refiningpure gold, all of ancient origin.Rhodes, whose debts were by now astronomical, and with the BSAC facinginsolvency, was delighted at these discoveries, especially when, in 1892,Theodore Bent wrote a spellbinding official report which appeared to show thatGreat Zimbabwe really was Ophir – or at least had the same origin – and had beenbuilt by ‘A race coming from Arabia – a race which spread more extensivelyacross the world than we have at present any concept of, a race closely akin tothe Phoenician and the Egyptian, strongly commercial, and eventually developinginto the more civilised races of the ancient world.’ These conclusions were farmore mysterious than anyone had expected.Perhaps because earlier – amateur – explorers like Karl Mauch had alreadylabelled Great Zimbabwe a Phoenician site, Bent was wary of making the sameoutright claim, despite the discovery of Phoenician and early Egyptianartefacts. In my more detailed 2005 study, The Lost City of Solomon and Sheba, Iin fact conclude that Bent was here describing either the Phoenicians underHyram, Solomon’s ancient Israelites, or nodding in the direction of one of the‘Lost Tribes’ of Israel. Whatever the case, the key to Bent’s theory is to befound in his suggestion that the builders of Great Zimbabwe were ‘akin’ to thePhoenicians (Solomon was related by marriage to the Phoenician king Hyram), andthere is a strong hint of a Jewish lost tribe in the phrase ‘eventuallydeveloped into the more civilised races of the ancient world’. A wandering orlost tribe might, indeed, explain the presence of these Arabians in Mashonaland.Since the publication of The Lost City of Solomon and Sheba, intriguing DNAevidence has come to light. The Ashkenazi line in modern Israelis carries asingular Y-chromosome mutation. In South Africa a small tribe, the Lemba, livingsouth of the main zimbabwes, has been found to carry the same mutation. Finally,two other groups have been located on a possible trade route down Africa: theFalasha Jews of Ethiopia and a similar group on the Comoros Islands.Significantly, a line drawn from the Comoros, just south of the 20th parallelacross central Africa, will pass first through Sofala, known as an entrepôt forgold since the days of Marco Polo, and then straight through Great Zimbabwe.Nevertheless, shortly before the turn of the nineteenth century, Bent’sconclusions caused such a furore among RGS Fellows that, some years later, anarchaeologist rather than an antiquarian was sent to examine the ruins. Heconcluded that Great Zimbabwe was medieval, though because of the hurried natureof the trip and the fact that the site had already been much disturbed, thisconclusion is rather dubious too.Rhodes opted for the Phoenician theory in order to boost the flagging spirits ofBSAC shareholders, who included influential friends of his like Rothschild,Beit, Barnato and Bailey. By ‘proving’ that Great Zimbabwe was in fact Ophir, hecould keep the company afloat until they discovered the location or at least thefate of all that gold.By the turn of the century some 114,814 mining claims had been registered bysettlers – more than half of them on the sites of ancient workings. The claim‘lines’ were usually 50 to 200 yards long, though some were much longer. Boththe New Killarney and the Surprise Mine had been opened up on ancient lines1,200 and 1,500 yards in length. The depths of their shafts averaged 30 to 50feet, though some exceeded 200 feet. There were also hundreds of claims thatextended deep into the hillsides.In 1899 Dr Hans Sauer, who by then was president of the Rhodesian Chamber ofMines, claimed: ‘Our experience in this country now amounts to this, that givena regular and extensive run of old workings on a block of claims, it is almost acertainty that a payable mine will be found on development of the ground.’However, this was far from the truth. The Golden Goose had definitely flown thecoop, or been carried off by the likes of the Queen of Sheba. The much-fabledgold of Mashonaland turned out to be nothing more than a handful of glitteringancient artefacts, and the only people to make any money were those who could bebothered to sift the sand of the derelict zimbabwes.Without ‘payable’ new gold, Rhodesia and the BSAC were just another South SeaBubble.1 [part0037.html#ch12fn-1] But Rhodes – and particularly the ineptJameson – seemed unconcerned by this. Instead, they focused on setting up afunctioning state in what they regarded as virgin, underpopulated territoryinhabited by Iron Age people. They had after all achieved their primaryobjective by adding a huge chunk of territory to the Empire, and now nothingstood in the way of expanding ever further northwards.That there was nothing but subsistence farming sufficient only to feed the localpopulation appeared not to bother Rhodes, and nor did the fact that even themost basic necessities of settler life – axles for wagons, nails for building,buckets for carrying water, soap for washing, medical supplies – were notavailable. These goods had to be brought in by ox wagon, usually taking monthsand at great cost. And when the rains came at the end of the dry season mattersgot really serious. What would they eat until next year’s crops were harvestedif there wasn’t enough gold in the ground to buy food?The Shona simply smiled and looked away in embarrassment when my pioneerpredecessors asked if they had food to sell – any food at all. The Shona hadnone to spare. And when in desperation the settlers approached Rhodes, heaccused them of whining and told them just to take from the Shona whatever theycould lay their hands on. The Shona, accustomed to being robbed and evenenslaved by the Matabele, had long since developed a system of cunningwell-provisioned hiding places where they survived these incursions, lairs whichoffered as much protection from white plunderers as they did from Africanneighbours. It was in one of these lairs, a vast cave at Sinoia, that as a boy Idiscovered abandoned Shona agricultural tools, disused fireplaces and anassortment of bones. The Shona generally refused to work for my forbears. Moneywas simply of no interest to them as there was nothing to buy. They were able tomake all the tools and weapons they needed, and in a good year their neat littlegardens and their livestock produced enough to feed their families.Heavy rains in the first half of 1891, described as the worst on record – thoughone wonders what records these were – cut the new colony off from the south.Maize and wheat, the settlers’ staple food, rotted on wagons trapped by floodingrivers. Malaria followed, and the price of quinine, the only prophylactic,soared from a few shillings to £5 a packet. Whisky was £1 a bottle, a pot of jam£2. The settlers’ children walked around barefoot and wore clothes made ofmealie sacks. While Rhodes did not exactly tell these ‘peasants’ to eat cake,when one deputation found him in his bath with a sponge over his brow, he threwone of his infamous tantrums. Every Shona village in the country was full ofmaize, pumpkins, beans and eggs, he reminded them. ‘Your agitation has notarisen from want of food but from something else,’ he thundered, ‘it is want ofliquor that displeases you.’Rhodes was at the time almost wholly preoccupied with events in Cape Town. Inhis new role as prime minister, he made a number of innovations and changes: heestablished financial stability by means of the Bank Act; he obtained ‘enormoussubscriptions’ for a university at the Cape; he scotched a Dutch republic inManicaland, which bordered Mashonaland; he negotiated with Kruger – who had toldhim pointedly that ‘ill-gotten gains are accursed’ – to take Lourenço Marquesfrom the Portuguese; he demanded of Britain that it annex Pondoland; heinitiated a railway system that ran from the Cape through the Orange Free Stateto Johannesburg, and began a railway in Rhodesia; he obtained imperial approvalfor his new territories (Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland); having negotiatedfavourable tariffs for the Rhodesias with the British government, he bought therival European Lippert Land Concession, thus extending his Mashona concession toencompass the whole of Matabeleland; he also offered to run Bechuanaland as wellas Rhodesia if England gave him £50,000 a year. Quite clearly, 1891 was a verybusy year for Cecil John Rhodes, and he even managed to fit in a visit toEngland where he was given another hero’s welcome. The Duke of Abercorn wasthere on a bitter winter’s morning to greet him off the train. And famously,during a visit to Windsor, he neatly sidestepped the Queen’s quite evidentconcerns regarding his sexuality.* * *That same year, Nathan Rothschild arrived at Rhodes’s hotel, the WestminsterPalace, for the first of several confidential meetings with Rhodes. Theyundoubtedly discussed the Secret Society, for in the very next will that Rhodesdrew up he added a codicil entrusting the Society and its future protection toRothschild. At Rhodes’s side was his latest friend, Charlie (later Sir Charles)Metcalfe, a mysterious intimate who kept the details of their relationshipsecret. For close on ten years Metcalfe accompanied Rhodes almost everywhere hewent.Rhodes was especially keen to win more friends so as to extend his influenceeven further. No one was better positioned to assist him in this than W.T.Stead, who regarded Rhodes as an apostle of Empire and exhorted Rhodes to thinkof himself in these terms. He evidently needed little encouragement, though, forRhodes confidently declared to Stead:If there is a God, it is clear that he would like me to do what He is doingHimself. And He is manifestly fashioning the English-speaking race as the choseninstrument by which He will bring in a state of society based upon Justice,Liberty and Peace. He would like me to paint as much of the map of AfricaBritish red as possible, and to do what I can elsewhere to promote the unity andextend the influence of the English-speaking race.2 [part0037.html#ch12fn-2]The domination of Africa had become the Secret Society’s means to a final end:world domination by the ‘English-speaking race’. Rhodes made it clear to Steadthat they should spend his entire fortune – which at this point was massive – onthe plan. Together the two men plotted the creation of a more formallystructured Society, which would be supported by a newspaper, the Review ofReviews, funded by Rhodes. By now Rhodes was utterly single-minded, eveninvoking the Bible: ‘Our Saviour was continually telling his Disciples that forHim everything must be abandoned.’ Uncompromising in his commitment, hedeclared: ‘I contend that the success of any undertaking depends mainly on thetotal devotion of the human mind to it and the abandonment of all other ordinarypursuits and pleasures to it.’There was one other important meeting during this glorious visit of 1891: Rhodeswent to see Reginald Baliol Brett, friend and confidant of Queen Victoria, andlater influential ‘whisperer’ to King Edward VII and King George V. It is notknown how the two men got to know each other, though Brett appears to have beencalled in after Stead’s first meeting with Rhodes. What is certain, however, isthat Brett and Rhodes had a lot more than imperial politics in common – indeed,Robert Rotberg puts this bluntly: ‘Brett was a well-connected, ingratiating,homosexual and pederast.’3 [part0037.html#ch12fn-3] A respected Rhodesbiographer, Rotberg would not have been this emphatic had he not been inpossession of ample evidence.Brett was part of a ring of influential politicians with similar predilictions.Best known among these was Lewis (‘Loulou’) Vernon Harcourt – son of the homesecretary Sir William Harcourt – who committed suicide when his escapades withan Eton student went public, and who had also sexually assaulted Brett’sdaughter.Brett habitually had affairs with Eton boys who had been groomed by his oldtutor, the details of which are graphically described in his Journals. ByBrett’s own account – as well as that of his homosexual biographer – he evenfelt a strong erotic attraction to his son, Maurice. He had, moreover, attemptedin 1890 to intercede for Lord Arthur Somerset who fled England at the height ofa rent-boy trial known as the Cleveland Street Scandal. The infamous trial, withits revelations about teenage ‘buggery’ at brothels frequented by aristocrats,took place at precisely the time Rhodes was attending intimate dinner partiesgiven by the likes of Verschoyle, Pater, Johnston and Frank Harris.The documented accounts of Brett’s sexual inclinations are significant becausethey represent rare hard evidence of the shared interests of three highlyinfluential men at the height of Empire: Cecil Rhodes, ‘Chinese’ Gordon, andRegy Brett himself. In the pages that follow, the list will grow, supportingrecent suggestions that a homosexual hegemony – which was already operative inthe Secret Society – went on to influence, if not control, British politics atthe beginning of the twentieth century.W.T. Stead, the heterosexual odd man out in all this, appears to have played aCassandra-like role, foretelling the future of his newspaper and the SecretSociety while snakes whispered in his ears – as with the legendary prophetess.Upon Stead’s death, Brett unwittingly revealed his importance to the SecretSociety – as well as that of the Society to Gordon – when he wrote in anobituary:He died poor and unrewarded. Yet he was rich in the esteem of many noble minds,and honored by the confidence of the greatest among his contemporaries. I oncesaid to General Gordon, ‘You appear to me always walking with God.’ He replied,‘Some of us do. Look at Stead. In the early days of their friendship Rhodes saidto me, speaking of Stead, “He is the greatest patriot I know; England is hishome and every foot of ground over which the British flag flies is his nativeland.”’Here they are, together again, Brett, Gordon, Rhodes and Stead – allincontrovertibly connected. The Elect of the Secret Society.* * *The end of 1891 was approaching, and it was time to go back to ‘my Rhodesia’,as, by now, Rhodes referred to that part of Africa. ‘I quite appreciate theenormous difficulties of opening up a new country,’ he wrote to Stead, ‘but ifprovidence will furnish a few paying gold reefs I think it will be all right.’But things were not all right. Jameson, with no experience whatsoever of civiladministration, was going through the Charter Company’s investment capital at analarming rate. The desperate state of affairs was reflected in a letter Rhodeswrote to Lord Salisbury at the time: ‘I have thrown into the country about 500wagon loads of food and with good fortune may just about be able to save thepopulation from starving during the next summer when all transport is closeddown.’ Others were equally concerned. The cantankerous Lord Randolph Churchill –admittedly then dying of syphilis – subsidised an extravagant safari to Rhodesiaby writing articles for the Daily Mail. This despite his dislike of Rhodes, andhis scorn for the country that bore his name. ‘It is neither an Arcadia nor anEl Dorado. It is no promised land,’ he wrote – and shares in the Charter Companyimmediately dropped by half.Rhodesia was landlocked, and this made for difficulties which no one hadanticipated. Trapped behind the Boers, hedged in by the Matabele and thePortuguese, cursed with rivers that flooded the road from the south each summer,there was also the deadly rinderpest, and malaria and the tsetse fly that struckdown travellers along the contested road to the Indian Ocean. With all this anda nervous Queen Victoria who kept vetoing its founder’s attempts to gain seaaccess, Rhodesia seemed doomed: Rhodes’s viable, independent state wasapparently the stuff of dreams.Despite these difficulties, Rhodes’s agents were busy throughout south-centralAfrica, hard at work acquiring new land concessions in their Empire-buildingexploits. Led by Jameson, Shippard and Beit, they were all members of the SecretSociety, and included Michell, Maguire, John Willoughby, Nathan Rothschild and anew favourite, Patrick W. Forbes. Rhodes himself was, together with Rothschild,scheming to buy a section of Mozambique, which would give Rhodesia a corridor tothe sea. Eduard Lippert, a relative of Beit, had managed to persuade Lobengulain 1891 to sell him a concession to administer the very land through whichRhodes’s Pioneers had marched – and which he then sold on to Rhodes, enablingthe latter to consolidate his territory. Selous had similar dealings with Rhodesregarding the Mazoe Concession, and news of these deals caused a rise in CharterCompany stocks. Further north, Little Harry Johnston, who rivalled Jameson interms of administrative incompetence, was busily at work in Nyasaland, andlusting after the Great Lakes region.The most serious excursion of all was mounted by yet another former journalist,A.R. Colquhoun, a hard-drinking flashy dresser whom Rhodes had, seemingly on awhim, made administrator of Mashonaland. Together with Colquhoun, FrederickSelous and a troop of settler police set out to take over adjoining Manicaland.They arrived at the kraal of Mtassa, chief of the Manica Shona in the mountainsto the east – territory which for centuries the Portuguese had claimed asfalling under their sphere of influence. Within days, Mtassa concededManicaland; like Lobengula, he did so in exchange for a large quantity of riflesand ammunition. The Portuguese mounted a counter-attack on Mtassa’s village, andwith Portuguese guns at his head, the chief retracted the concession.Immediately, Captain Forbes – ‘a typical British bulldog with about as muchsense’, according to John X. Merriman – arrived with sixteen Rhodesian troopers.Hot on his heels were two senior Portuguese diplomats and seventy troopers.However, when reinforcements arrived, Forbes routed the Portuguese and arrestedthe diplomats, sending them under escort on the dangerous overland journey backto Cape Town.Queen Victoria heard news of the incident and was certainly not amused,especially when the Portuguese government threatened war. By then this operabuffa had reached new heights of absurdity as Forbes, blithely oblivious to thepolitical catastrophe he had triggered, continued his advance towards the IndianOcean, triumphantly waving Rhodes’s flag. The Queen ordered Rhodes to stop theadvance, which, after an enraged outburst, Rhodes was forced to do. Forbes’sdaring dash had given Rhodes almost as much satisfaction as the originaloccupation – indeed, he had for a time contemplated the possibility of a secondPioneer Column to the coast. From that moment on, however, Rhodes’s hopes ofgaining a port for Rhodesia were dashed. Part of the fallout of the Forbesfiasco was that it stymied Rothschild’s attempts to purchase the Pungwe flats,near Beira, from the Portuguese.Goods bound for Rhodesia were nevertheless permitted to be imported throughBeira, and Rhodes, with Portuguese consent, built a narrow-gauge railway fromthe port to Salisbury. Rhodesians and the Portuguese colonists shared a commoninterest in opposing African nationalism, and consequently had cordialrelations, a situation that continued until the 1960s. Following the Rhodesiangovernment’s Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965, British primeminister Harold Wilson blockaded the oil depot at Beira which supplied Rhodesia.It ceased only in 1975, when Frelimo – the nationalist liberation front – gainedindependence for Mozambique. Five years later, following wars and protractednegotiations, Zimbabwe was born, with communist-aligned Robert Mugabe its first– and indeed only – president since 1980.Rhodes’s food wagons successfully kept starvation at bay that fateful year of1891, though by then he had decided to abandon his personal share in the goldwhich was beginning to trickle in from Mashonaland. And in late October thatyear, a weekly newspaper, the Rhodesia Herald, was founded in Fort Salisbury.* * *Some seventy-five years later, this same newspaper made the decision to recruitlocal journalists rather than importing professionals from England. And so, twodays after my eighteenth birthday in 1972, I clocked in on my first day as a cubreporter in the Herald newsroom. I was told to report to a news editor, Mr RexHarris, who apparently scorned the new Rhodesian upstarts. ‘Who, pray, are you?One of these new Rhodesian cadets?’ he enquired, and I admitted I was. Then hegrinned and said to me: ‘Into the Valley of Death rode the six hundred. Welcomeaboard a sinking ship.’The Herald had the day before printed a story announcing their selection oflocal journalistic candidates – just six from more than 600 applicants acrossthe country. There being no university in Rhodesia at the time, my father hadwanted me to enrol at Rhodes University in Grahamstown, South Africa, but JeevesHougaard had persuaded him, on the strength of my final English results, toenter me as a Churchill Scholar for the Herald ‘lottery’. This had the advantageof saving my father the fees for a university education which as a lowly clerkhe could ill afford. But who knows, had things gone the other way I mightpossibly have been a Rhodes Scholar, and this story would probably never havebeen written!‘Take this up to the print room,’ said Rex Harris, handing me a sheet of roughpaper with a typed-out news story. I followed his instructions and entered ahuge, noisy room where sweaty linotype operators were loading warm metal intoframes. As I walked in they all threw scraps of the bright silver metal at me.It was my initiation – my rite of passage – into a business, the fourth estate,which I have equally loved and hated ever since.* * *On Rhodes’s first visit to the new colony of Rhodesia, he faced a huge protestmeeting in Fort Salisbury attended by almost every settler who lived there. Hewas accused of starving the colony of investment. Not a single stamp mill, forexample, had been brought in for the struggling gold industry.Rhodes knew, but could not say openly, that under Jameson the country hadalready soaked up £580,000 of its £606,000 start-up capital and that the CharterCompany was essentially bankrupt, kept going only by personal loans from Beit,De Beers and himself. Even loyal Alfred Beit remarked to another investor: ‘Sofar I have not seen anything that I think worth putting a £100 into’ – thusreflecting the consensus of the protestors.But all this was water off a duck’s back. Rhodes had fallen in love withRhodesia, which he now treated like a wayward child. And when he decided to makehis next journey to Rhodesia, this ‘consumptive’ with the ‘dicky heart’travelled not by the safer Great North Road but via the fever-infested deltasurrounding Beira. He did this for no other reason than he was convinced hewould eventually own this land too. When ordered by a Portuguese customs officerin Beira to open his personal luggage for inspection, Rhodes stalked out.Enraged, he glared at Frank Johnson who had come from Salisbury to see himsafely ashore, and shouted, ‘I’ll take this fucking country off them!’After a sixty-mile trip on the malaria-infested Pungwe River, Rhodes continuedthe journey to Umtali along a road that was nothing more than a footpath,difficult even for horses to negotiate. Eventually abandoning their carts, theparty slogged on through tsetse-fly country for a further twenty days on foot,living off game birds shot by Rhodes. Again, Rhodes’s constitution provedrobust.His humour improved as they moved upcountry. The mountains around Umtali areamong the most beautiful in the world, with alpine meadows, vivid yellow gorseand tumbling brooks filled with fish. Rhodes fell so in love with theChimanimani range that he would later make his largest property investmentthere: the vast fruit-growing estate that he eventually gave to his latest‘lad’, Johnny Grimmer, to run after Johnny turned to drink and Rhodes felt tooembarrassed to take him about. As Rhodes’s party approached Salisbury throughthe verdant bush around Marandellas, Johnson recalls that Rhodes became more andmore excited. But he tarried only four days in the little town ofcorrugated-iron shacks, patently irritated with the discontented settlers whomhe simply regarded as ungrateful. From there he headed south to Fort Victoriawhere a telegraph had just arrived and a vast pile of messages awaited him.Fort Victoria is the town closest to Great Zimbabwe, and a day or two laterRhodes paid his first visit to the ruins together with fellow parliamentarianDavid Christian de Waal, a friend of Jan Hofmeyr. Utterly overawed, De Waalwrote in his autobiography: ‘A strange feeling ran through me as I stood thereand cast my eyes upon the ruins; it was the same sensation I felt when I beheldthe remains of ancient Rome, and, at a later date those of Pompeii andHerculaneum.’ Rhodes’s own reaction was one of speechlessness, and there are norecords of another visit to Great Zimbabwe.By now prospectors had been given the word that they should sink shafts whereverthey found lines of old workings, and some of these mines were yielding a viablereturn of up to nine ounces per ton. So when De Waal returned to the Cape heurged his followers to emigrate to Rhodesia, in terms which could have beentaken verbatim from the Confession of Faith: ‘Just as once the eye of Europe wasturned to America and a great migration followed thither, so it shall fall onAfrica – and with the same result. Now is the time to trek.’ And trek they did,setting up their own little town of Enkeldoorn – in my own rugby-playing youththe Afrikaner boys at Enkeldoorn school were rumoured to be bred with no necks,going automatically into scrummage stance whenever a whistle was blown.Rhodes’s silence before the ruins of Great Zimbabwe may be read as awe, but itis equally possible that his mind was otherwise occupied, for his eyes werealready turning to the rest of Africa. Upon returning to Cape Town he had anasty fall from his horse, and he complained afterwards that his heart wastroubling him. But the truth is he was eating, smoking and drinking too much,and the political stress hadn’t let up – nor would it for a while. Stead wasurging him to agree to and fund a new working structure for the Secret Societywhose first priority was global English hegemony.There were pressing problems in Rhodesia, however, so he put everything on holdwhile he tried to stabilise the situation there. Though unwilling to admit it,Rhodes had in fact lost control of the gung-ho Jameson, as is illustrated by theevents of mid-February 1891, while Rhodes was still in England. The concessionfor Manicaland had been obtained from Mtassa, but the wherewithal to secure theterritory, the rifles and the ammunition, had still to be smuggled in. And noone could think of a way of getting them past the Portuguese.While Rhodes was occupied in disarming Queen Victoria at Windsor – in effectsquaring her in a manner not dissimilar to the way he had squared Lobengula –the 100-ton Countess of Carnarvon was steamed up the Limpopo under the commandof Rutherfoord Harris in an act of blatant gunrunning set up by Jameson. Thesecunning agents of the Secret Society got away with it: a Portuguese customsofficer had signed off on their cargo of small arms for a generous fee. BraveJameson – he was ever brave – arrived at the Manica chief’s kraal at about thesame time as the guns were delivered. He had traipsed 700 miles across soddenbushland recently depopulated in an mfecane by the warlike Shangaans. The gooddoctor persuaded Mtassa that the guns demonstrated the English queen’sdomination of the area, and the chief endorsed the concession – whose validitythe Portuguese later denied, however, claiming that Mtassa was their vassal.Jameson marched back to the Limpopo where he found the Carnarvon, which had inthe meantime steamed to Durban and back, waiting for him. But a large Portuguesegunboat arrived, arrested the Rhodesian party and then, according to Jameson’saccount, shipped them back to Lourenço Marques where they were held ‘in the holdwith all the filthy Portuguese and niggers’.Rhodes was so incensed by this shaming of his beloved administrator that hedecided on an even more outrageous response. Young, tough John Willoughby,member of the Secret Society and active participant in the Rhodes all-male set,4[part0037.html#ch12fn-4] was immediately ordered to Beira. Rhodes instructedWilloughby to openly confront the Portuguese on the Pungwe, thereby provoking anincident which would result in a British diplomatic reaction if the Portuguesedecided to block the free passage of Britons up the river. The Colonial Officetried to stop this illegal expedition – Lord Salisbury had just made a speech inthe Lords affirming Portugal’s right to the east coast – but by the time theinjunction reached Durban, Willoughby’s ship had sailed.At Beira, Willoughby arrogantly announced that with his shipload of men andequipment – thirteen whites, ninety-one Africans, a stagecoach, and several tonsof tools – he intended to march through the disputed territory and build a roadfrom Sofala to Umtali. This was nothing other than a thinly disguised invasionforce. The Portuguese immediately denied Willoughby passage, and when hebrazenly ignored them and steamed ahead they fired shots from their gunboatacross the bow of his ship.Willoughby and Rhodes got away with this Beira outrage because politics were sodelicately poised in Europe. While there was the omnipresent danger of a Germanreaction, there was also the continual threat of Portugal strengthening itsclaim to Mozambique. A lack of British resolve was to be avoided – it mightencourage the Germans to take over the Portuguese spheres of influence and joinforces with the Boers. As Rhodes had expected, Lord Salisbury declared hiscountry affronted by Portugal’s denial of British access to the river, only partof which was in their sphere of influence, and he dispatched British gunboats tothe Pungwe. The ensuing stand-off was eventually resolved by a settlement whichinfuriated Rhodes: while entrenching Britain’s access rights to the Pungwe, itgave him no territorial rights at all. He was also forced to give up aPortuguese fort at Macqueque on the Zambezi which Forbes had attacked and taken,killing twenty-one Portuguese soldiers in the process. The British simplyignored Rhodes’s pique, advising him to regard the affair as a victory since hehad his passage to the interior. Willoughby was feted as a hero – which may wellhave encouraged Jameson to take the same gamble with his subsequent raid intothe Transvaal.* * *From the time Rhodes conquered Rhodesia, he clearly became a kleptocrat whocynically used British influence to advance his aims, while ignoring anystrictures that conflicted with them. Rhodes referred to such strictures as the‘Imperial Factor’. He was contemptuous of the fractious British political scene,as well as the endless manoeuvrings of Disraeli, Gladstone, Rosebery andSalisbury in the slippery game played by Liberals and Tories seeking to stay inpower.The Empire envisioned by Rhodes and Ruskin seemed to the Secret Society to beflagging. The ‘race’ of English supermen, with their divine right to rule,should have been colonising an ever-expanding Empire which, however, remainedtantalisingly out of Britain’s grasp. Others like the Germans and the Belgianswere demanding their share of Africa, and British political tardiness was makingit so much easier for them to grab what they could. Rhodes was contemptuous ofwhat he saw as Salisbury’s overcautiousness. When decisive action needed to betaken, Rhodes himself never held back. Indeed, he was spurred on by the newLiberal prime minister, Lord Rosebery, who compared him to the Elizabethanadventurer Raleigh, and his achievements in Africa to earlier crusades tocolonise lands that were not Christian.The Rhodes who sailed from London in the winter of 1891 was a man of influencewho realised that, if he was quick enough, much of the African continent wouldbe his for the taking. He was confident too that he had the mechanism, his newlyregenerated Secret Society, to shape others to his will. When Rhodes announcedhe was returning to Africa, Lord Salisbury, then still prime minister, offeredto host a grand farewell dinner. This was clear recognition of the status he hadachieved, but Rhodes was due to sail for Africa that very night. So a call wasmade, and the Union mailship anchored off Southampton was given orders to waitfor Rhodes until the following morning, when he would join it after the trip onhis special train. By now, everyone knew who Rhodes was.It is unsurprising that when Rhodes arrived at Fort Victoria, he had little timeor indeed inclination to admire the splendours of Great Zimbabwe. Among thetelegrams waiting for him were several from W.T. Stead. Rhodes was informed thatStead had completed a working plan for the English Secret Society, and the timehad come to make it a reality."},{"pageContent":"13Sex and SensibilityAt this point of his story, Rhodes’s biographers usually succumb to one of twostereotypes: Rhodes the venerated VIP pre-eminent among Empire-builders, orRhodes the pirate, the Raleigh of his time, who has gambled his all in Africaand now needs luck to survive. Neither is particularly accurate, however.There is also a third Rhodes: a reclusive, introverted individual with a poorlydeveloped sensibility – especially where his own sexuality is concerned. ThisRhodes is also a carpetbagger, dishonest to his shareholders and to himself,careless of the company he keeps, often cantankerous and hysterical when riled,and sometimes even sadistic. Indeed, Rotberg contends that Rhodes’s aggressiveteasing of his lover, Grimmer, had elements of sado-masochism.1[part0037.html#ch13fn-1]By now Rhodes is thirty-eight years old. He has been lurking in the relativedarkness of the closet for twenty years – when suddenly he discovers he is notalone in this. This Rhodes goes off to England, and encounters a community quitedifferent from anything he has so far experienced. In Africa, colonials withhomosexual inclinations were doomed to a life sentence in the closet. To ‘comeout’ meant certain abuse, social vilification and the risk of violence. Themajority lived secret lives, sometimes seeking comfort across the race divide.In some African countries homosexuality remains a taboo – with dangerousconsequences.Rhodes’s contemporaries included bisexuals, especially among the upper classes,where this was a fashion of the Victorian age, becoming even more voguish in theEdwardian era. For the rich, marriage with children did not preclude affairswith men and boys – or indeed the molestation and even rape of young girls andwomen. Rhodes soon participated in secret meetings with minister of the Crown,Lewis ‘Loulou’ Harcourt, an aristocrat and man about town who was also RegyBrett’s best friend. The Rhodes who thrived on this company is the Rhodes weneed most to understand as it puts his obsession with secrecy into somethingapproaching a rational context. It also explains his obsession with loyalty.Rhodes discovered in England that homosexuals survived only if they formed asociety that remained secret, ring-fenced by wealth and political influence.When this class of moralistic Victorians encountered practices they deemedrepugnant, they simply looked the other away. The class structure that operatedin the general community was also evident among gays; there were upper-classhomosexuals and working-class homosexuals. There were also crossover points –the elegant rent-boy brothels of the West End, where the two social classescould meet and mix in comparative safety. Victorian gays could only operatefreely from within this unique ‘band of brothers’. Those among them who dared todisplay – or even celebrate – their sexual preference were instantly dispatched,mostly abroad and usually by their relatives, often for life.In 1891 when Stead arranged for Rhodes to mingle with the rich and powerful inEngland, Rhodes discovered that this band of brothers was not only large butcomposed of extremely powerful people. They met at private dinner parties likeVerschoyle’s but they also attended the grand entertainments of societyhostesses. It was at such functions that Rhodes learnt the rules of Victorianhomosexuality: charm the women, perhaps an easy undertaking if one were anaesthete or avant garde, though Rhodes was neither. Alternatively, share thebeds of bisexual women, though the most effective ploy by far was to don theimpermeable suit of social armour: marriage. The coup de grace was to have a fewoffspring of one’s own, within wedlock of course.Both W.T. Stead and Bramwell Booth of the Salvation Army tried to persuadeRhodes to wear this armour, and had he lived longer he may well have beentempted. Rhodes certainly tested the waters in his friendship with OliveSchreiner – a failed effort, however. By the time of his death Rhodes’s attitudeto women had warmed, at least socially, and in spite of persistent gossip abouthis sexual inclinations he continued to receive numerous letters offeringmarriage.The Queen herself was undoubtedly aware of the silent conspiracy around theissue of homosexuality, but what really mattered was that the public face ofVictorian society be presentable. The two monarchs who preceded her might bedescribed as libidinous, for both George V and William IV had numerousmistresses with whom they had many bastard children who were usually wellsupported, and often granted titles. But the God-fearing Victorians weregenerally churchgoers who worked hard at social reform, improving conditions forworking-class children and abolishing slavery, as well as spreading the Word ofGod throughout the world, and building the Empire. They regarded themselves as achosen and exemplary people, and seemed blissfully unaware of the meaning ofhypocrisy.When Victoria died, this cloak of morality was thrown aside and society, led bythe more libertine Edward VII, soon reverted to the behaviour of earlier times.Regy Brett moved seamlessly from one era to the next, and soon gained the ear ofthe new reigning monarch. Brett adapted as social mores changed, and in theensuing decades these mores changed swiftly. Within thirty years an English kingwould swap his throne for his divorced American mistress – indeed, EdwardWindsor and Mrs Simpson play a seminal role as the story of Rhodes eventuallyunspools.All over Europe, change was evident. In the art world, for example, thegold-tinted nudes of Gustav Klimt burst onto the scene. Their eroticism shockedthe staid conservatism of the Austro-Hungarians – whose royal family werecousins to the British – as the Symbolists explored the possibilities of artoutside the confines of tradition. Literature was, similarly, scandalising abourgeois public, and the coterie known as the Bloomsbury Group includedhomosexuals such as E.M. Forster, Lytton Strachey, artist Duncan Grant andradical economist John Maynard Keynes – who had an affair with Strachey. Thelatter cohabited – though platonically – with the promiscuous artist DoraCarrington, who, upon hearing of Strachey’s death, shot herself. Virginia Woolfhad lesbian affairs with both Vita Sackville-West and Violet Keppel, eventuallydrowning herself. Her sister Vanessa Bell lived with the artist Duncan Grant,who had previously had three male lovers, including her own husband Clive Bell.Sackville-West had two children in her open marriage with her bisexual husbandHarold Nicolson. This era makes the ‘Swinging Sixties’ look positively pale incomparison.Yet Rhodes’s era – straddling the late Victorian and early Edwardian periods –was not simply a hotbed of illicit homosexuality but rather an extraordinarytime of sexual experimentation, conducted in a discreet manner in clandestinegroups. People could ‘swing’ any way they wanted – provided they kept it quiet.The popular gentlemen’s clubs along the Mall were all a form of secret society.Mostly within range of Piccadilly and Fitzrovia, where prostitution, both maleand female, was rife, the clubs provided accommodation for members, though theydid not permit sex on the premises. Indeed, the infamous card (‘For Oscar Wildeposing somdomite [sic]’) which caused Wilde to sue the Marquess of Queensberryfor criminal libel, was left for Wilde at one such club, the Albermarle. Theseclubs were extremely selective and protective of their membership. Rhodes, atthe height of his fame, was blackballed by the Travellers Club – of which I am,incidentally, a member – allegedly because of his involvement in the JamesonRaid. This scandal nevertheless reflected Rhodes’s increasing influence: thePrince of Wales resigned from the Travellers in protest.* * *Other societies of the time were far more clandestine than Rhodes’s SecretSociety, among them the aforementioned Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Thisorganisation flourished in the late Victorian and early Edwardian eras and itsfocus was on magic and the occult. Its cabals specialised in esotericphilosophy, astrology, geomancy, astral travel, scrying (spirit mediums) andalchemy. Its link with the Rhodes Secret Society is through W.T. Stead and theIrish spy Maud Gonne. An Irish nationalist, Gonne was acquainted with thePrincess Radziwill, whom Stead used as a spy for his newspaper and later to spyon Rhodes. Maud Gonne was the long-time love of the poet W.B. Yeats, the mostfamous member of Golden Dawn. Stead devoted his latter years to the occult andmysticism, a shift of loyalties which cost him control of Rhodes’s fortune asRhodes viewed this as a breach of secrecy and a betrayal of loyalty.These secret societies were formed essentially to protect their membership frompublic scrutiny or criticism of their more esoteric activities – homosexualitywas indeed the least ‘dangerous’ of these, as Stead himself had revealed in hisexposé of child prostitution. The taking of oaths and initiation ceremonies wereinstituted to prevent betrayal. The Oscar Wilde case was a significant moment inthe history of gay rights, and it occurred exactly during Rhodes’s time inLondon. Existing records, such as Regy Brett’s Journals, indicate its effect onthe thinking and behaviour of the English homosexual elite.The lives of Wilde and Rhodes have an uncannily identical trajectory: bornwithin a year of each other, they were at Oxford together, and, initially atleast, both men were repressed homosexuals; they came into the public eye in thesame year, and in their latter years both fell from grace, and died, utterlydisgraced, in their late forties. Their story is a vignette of the moral andpolitical environment of the time, where Rhodes and Wilde grew from obscurity towidespread fame and eventual notoriety.Wilde was found guilty of public indecency and sentenced to hard labour, whichentailed the mentally corrosive and physically exhausting prison treadmill. Foran aesthete, such physical labour would have been especially gruelling, andWilde’s friends begged him to flee the country – as indeed other homosexuals hadbeen forced to do. However, encouraged by his mother – another Irish nationalist– and believing he was protected by his fame, Wilde decided to make a stand forthe ‘love that dare not speak its name’ – as Wilde’s lover, Alfred Douglas, hadput it in his poem ‘Two Loves’.The Oscar Wilde affair certainly scared the prime minister of the time, thesomewhat effete Archibald Philip Primrose, Lord Rosebery. W.T. Stead wrote toBrett – and presumably Rhodes also – about his concerns for the prime minister’smental health in the wake of the scandal. Rhodes and his circle wouldundoubtedly have been concerned for their friend, the prime minister, given hissexual indiscretions. The friendship between Rhodes and Rosebery strengthened,and after Rhodes’s death, he chaired the Rhodes Trust.Rhodes would surely have been haunted by the terrible sentence imposed on Wildeas well as its repercussions (he never wrote for the stage again). Since this iswoven into Rhodes’s own story, it is worth recounting here. The son of Dublinintellectuals, Oscar Wilde read ‘Greats’ (the humanities) at Oxford, provinghimself an outstanding classicist. His tutors Walter Pater and John Ruskininfluenced him to become involved in the Aesthetic Movement. Rhodes himself wasinfluenced by Ruskin, and of course knew Pater through Verschoyle. Wilde’s firstnovel, The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890), made his name, and subsequent plays,including his masterpiece, The Importance of Being Earnest (1895), made him asmall fortune.In 1881 (the year Rhodes was elected to the Cape Parliament and came down fromOxford), Wilde married Constance Lloyd, and her generous annual allowance of£250 enabled the couple to live in Tite Street, Chelsea, a noted artisticquarter. Wilde was a devoted father to his sons, Cyril and Vyvyan, though he hadalso taken a male lover, Robbie Ross. Rhodes was by then back in Kimberley,where he was mourning the death of his first love, Neville Pickering. Wilde thenfell in love with the unstable Alfred ‘Bosie’ Douglas, son of the Marquess ofQueensberry. The latter disapproved of Wilde’s flamboyant style, and wasdetermined to destroy his son’s lover – a situation made worse by the fact thathe suspected Rosebery too of having ‘buggered’ Francis, his eldest son. Rhodeswould have been all too aware of this as he was now touring the society salons,usually accompanied by a lamb or two.By the time Rhodes made his fifth will entrusting the Secret Society to Stead,his beneficiary, Wilde was completely infatuated with Bosie, though stillplaying by the Victorian rules, spending time with his wife and children. ButBosie, drinking heavily and loathing his abusive father, threw caution to thewinds. He introduced Wilde to the underground of gay prostitution with itsworking-class rent boys, and on one such rendezvous Wilde took the boy to ahotel room. Wilde was now engaged in rough trade, where blackmail was oftenpractised. Matters came to a head in 1894 when Queensberry implicitly accusedWilde of sodomy: ‘I do not say that you are it, but you look it, and pose at it,which is just as bad. And if I catch you and my son again in any publicrestaurant I will thrash you.’ It was after this that the Marquess left hisinfamous calling card at the Albermarle: ‘For Oscar Wilde, posing somdomite’(deliberately misspelt, perhaps).Wilde had Queensberry arrested for criminal libel, since the card amounted to apublic accusation that Wilde had committed a felony. Queensberry could avoidconviction only by demonstrating that his accusation was in fact true, so hetook the case to trial. The trial opened in April 1895 among scenes of nearhysteria both in the press and the public galleries. Never before had thecurtains on Victorian homosexuality been opened so wide. When the defenceannounced that several male prostitutes would testify that they had had sex withWilde, the prosecution was dropped and Queensberry was found not guilty. Thecourt declared that Queensberry’s accusation was ‘true in substance and infact’. The acquittal rendered Wilde liable for costs and he left the courtbankrupt. Worse was to come, however.A warrant for Wilde’s arrest was applied for on charges of sodomy and grossindecency. Wilde again ignored advice to leave the country – and there can belittle doubt that the government would have preferred him to go. Bosie Douglas,who was patently as guilty as Wilde, was allowed to do just that and fled toParis with several of Wilde’s friends. Wilde spoke eloquently at his trial andthe jury failed to reach a verdict, but Queensberry’s desire for revenge knew nolimits and a new trial was ordered where Wilde immortalised a line from Bosie’spoem to him:[Homosexuality] may be described as ‘the love that dare not speak its name’, andthat on account of it I am placed where I am now. It is beautiful, it is fine,it is the noblest form of affection. There is nothing unnatural about it. It isintellectual, and it repeatedly exists between an older and a younger man, whenthe older man has intellect, and the younger man has all the joy, hope andglamour of life before him. That it should be so, the world does not understand.The world mocks at it, and sometimes puts one in the pillory for it.On 25 May 1895, Oscar Fingal O’Flahertie Wills Wilde and Alfred Taylor (thebrothel-keeper) were convicted of gross indecency and sentenced to two years’‘hard labour’. That same year, Cecil Rhodes was gazetted a privy councillor. Itwas also the year Jameson brought Rhodes’s stellar political career to an end inhis failed attempt to occupy the gold-rich Transvaal with a band of Rhodesian –officially British – police and volunteer settlers armed to the teeth with Maximmachine guns.Rhodes and Wilde were destroyed by a similar kind of arrogance. Rhodes believedthat his actions were predestined, which justified Jameson murdering a few Boerswith his Maxims, occupying the Transvaal, and thereby achieving the unificationof southern Africa. Was it not written in his stars? When the trials andtribulations resulting from the Jameson Raid were over, Rhodes was a broken man,his career and health ruined – just like Wilde. And again like Wilde, Rhodesmistook fame for good fortune, decided the time was right to name the love thelaw forbade, made his stand – and paid the price. Apart from this, it isunlikely that Rhodes was actually a friend of Wilde, and once the gossip millsbegan, he would probably have given Wilde a wide berth. He was, however, closelyassociated with some of Wilde’s friends, including Frank Harris, who appearedfor the defence at Wilde’s trial.There was at the time a ‘gang’ suspected of strongly influencing Britishpolitics in the first part of the twentieth century: Brett, a homosexual andactive pederast; the promiscuous and predatory Loulou Harcourt, who for a whilewas secretary to his father William, the home secretary, and who himself laterbecame colonial secretary; Archie Primrose, Lord Rosebery, prime minister, whowas accused by the Marquess of Queensberry of sodomising his eldest son; andCecil Rhodes who, after Neville Pickering’s death, was no longer averse toparading his lambs and angels on social outings. There were many more, likeArthur Balfour, the self-obsessed, aloof and effete future prime minister whonever married. It would not be long before the issue of gay and lesbian controlof British society and government was eventually raised in Parliament.In a journal entry of 3 February 1890, Brett records that Rhodes visited Steadthe day after he disembarked, and that he himself had attended the meeting: ‘Ileft them together,’ Brett notes. ‘Tonight I saw Stead again. Rhodes had talkedfor three hours about all his great schemes.’ Twelve days later, on 15 February,Brett records that he met Rhodes again, this time at Lord Rothschild’s countryhouse where Rhodes was ‘in the company of Arthur Balfour, the Harcourts, AlbertGrey, Alfred Lyttelton’.Albert, Earl Grey, was the most respected politician of the era and would becomegovernor general of Canada. Rhodes persuaded him to become director of hisproposed Charter Company, and later on to replace Jameson as administrator ofRhodesia. Arthur Balfour would eventually rise to the position of primeminister, while Alfred Lyttelton would become colonial secretary.* * *The Wilde affair was by no means the only homosexual scandal troubling those inhigh places in the early 1890s. In 1889, London society had already been shakento its core by a police raid which became known as the ‘Cleveland StreetScandal’. It was another case of Victorian homosexuality breaking free of itsconstraints, only this time the allegations involved the British royal family.Moreover, the Secret Society, through Brett and Rosebery, seems to have beenactively implicated in the affair.In Cleveland Street, Fitzrovia, a male brothel like the one frequented by OscarWilde was raided by police. It was rumoured that one of the clients was PrinceAlbert Victor, eldest son of the Prince of Wales, and second in line to theBritish throne. The government of Lord Rosebery initiated an immediate cover-upof any royal involvement in the affair, and nothing was ever proved and nocharges laid against Albert.One of the named clients of the brothel was Lord Arthur Somerset, an equerry tothe Prince of Wales. His relationship with Prince Albert was never regarded asanything more than malicious gossip until, many years later, his private letterswere published. They reveal a close friendship with Regy Brett, whose own sexualindiscretions – both many and varied – were later revealed in his Journals.Referring to the Cleveland Street Scandal, Somerset wrote to Brett: ‘I can quiteunderstand the Prince of Wales being much annoyed at his son’s name beingcoupled with the thing … we were both accused of going to this place but nottogether.’ Sometime later, Brett arranged for Somerset to go into exile abroad.There were also the infamous Harcourts, who, as Brett notes in a journal entryin February 1890, met Rhodes at Lord Rothschild’s country house ‘in the companyof Arthur Balfour, Albert Grey, and Alfred Lyttelton’. Lewis ‘Loulou’ Harcourtwas the son of the eminent Liberal statesman Sir William. Loulou’s mother diedsoon after he was born, and he grew up a sickly child who developed a closerelationship with his father, eventually serving as his private secretary untilthe age of forty. Upon William’s death, Loulou entered Parliament, in timebecoming colonial secretary. He married an American heiress, Mary Burns, in1899. The outwardly conventional couple had a son and two daughters – but Loulouwas also a paedophile who preyed on children of both sexes.His friend, Regy Brett, shared his sexual tastes, though Regy’s preference wasboys, including Maurice, his own son, who procured Eton school friends for hisown father. Loulou also seduced Maurice, as well as Regy’s young daughter,Dorothy. Regy was concerned his friend’s public profile might land him introuble: Etonians were already being warned to avoid being alone in the companyof Lord Harcourt, and ironically of Brett himself.2 [part0037.html#ch13fn-2]‘Some time during the autumn of 1921, Loulou pounced on an Eton boy who, withhis mother, was visiting Nuneham Court, the Harcourts’ country house inOxfordshire.’ That boy was Edward James, who later became patron of fellowEtonian, poet laureate John Betjeman. James recalls in his memoirs that he hadfought off Loulou’s advances, describing him as ‘a hideous and horrible oldman’, and reporting the incident to his mother. Indignant, she spread word ofthe assault among her friends, and the story slowly made the social descentuntil it reached the police. Thus ended the career of Loulou Harcourt.Before this, however, in that heady year of 1890 when Rhodes first madeacquaintance with Harcourt, Rosebery and the rest, Lord Queensberry had his ownaxe to grind: he had accused Rosebery of seducing his eldest son FrancisDouglas, who was at the time serving as Rosebery’s secretary. Francis had beenappointed Lord Drumlanrig at Rosebery’s instigation. This further fuelled thegossip mills as there was no real career justification for the appointment. Thereason may well have been spite on the part of Rosebery, for Queensberry hadrefused to take the oath of allegiance required for admission to the House ofLords. The elevation of his son infuriated the bellicose Queensberry –remembered, incidentally, for introducing the ‘Queensberry Rules’ into the sportof boxing – and he went on the rampage against Rosebery, as well as Wilde. In aletter to Bosie, he said that Francis had also been seduced by ‘Snob Queers likeRosebery’. The new Lord Drumlanrig died of a gunshot wound a year later – hisbrother Bosie told Wilde it was suicide, caused by their father’s hounding ofFrancis. His son’s death led the homophobic Queensberry to focus on Wilde, andit is possible that Rosebery used his influence to keep the Wilde trials runningin order to deflect attention from himself and the affair with Francis.Despite these scandals and machinations, the achievements of these men,including the Harcourts, have filled many a book, and even the Marquess ofQueensberry’s appalling reputation has softened over the years. Suffice to saythat there is ample evidence – at precisely the moment when Rhodes was at theheight of his power – of a homosexual and paedophiliac cadre at the very summitof English politics. Rhodes was directly connected to the cadre through W.T.Stead and Regy Brett, who built the Secret Society in England. That Rhodesinfluenced the decisions of that powerful cadre there is no doubt. Hisinfluence, moreover, grew throughout his lifetime, as is evidenced by the factthat Rosebery himself headed the Rhodes Trust after Rhodes’s death.Rosebery’s brief one-year term as prime minister (1894–1895) constituted, forthe Society, a period of apprenticeship in influencing and later runningsubsequent British governments. Regy Brett may even have influenced QueenVictoria in her choice of Rosebery as prime minister, given her dislike of theother candidates. Yet Rhodes’s biographers as well as most historians haveeither denied or ignored this possibility. The subject is apparently taboo, inspite of evidence that is readily available. Nor is this the only area where thehistory of Rhodes has been warped. The received ‘truth’ of Rhodes’s life is thathe worked himself to death building an Empire in Africa for the English-speakingpeople and was only brought down by Jameson’s arrogance and stupidity. However,the actual truth is that, like most gamblers, Rhodes’s luck ran out, and afterthe disastrous Jameson Raid in which he was heavily complicit, he started todrink heavily. These human failings have not been properly addressed, certainlynot in the early biographies. There are many pages describing Rhodes’s valiantfight against looming illness, but they contain little to suggest that theultimate cause of his death may well have been the sins of the flesh.* * *One morning in Rhodes’s billiard room at Groote Schuur I was turning over someold picture albums, and to my surprise I came across his wine cellar book. Thelast hand to touch it may well have been Rhodes’s own. The annotations on thedaily consumption of alcohol at his table are undoubtedly his. Day in and dayout, huge quantities of wine, whisky, sherry, gin, as well as port, beer andparticularly champagne, were hauled up from that cellar for Rhodes and hisguests. Everybody noticed but seemingly only a few noted. F. Edmund Garrett,editor of the Cape Times (and an early intimate of Rhodes), is typical of theVictorian apologists: ‘The truth is that the life-work which was to Mr. Rhodes adevouring passion, if it left too little scope for some of the virtues, lefteven less for most of the vices.’Rhodes drank copiously, ate gluttonously and smoked like a chimney. And he had amore than passing interest in men with similar vices. In 1893, young HarryJohnston was summoned after midnight to ‘Groeteschuur’ to be met by a garrulousRhodes in pyjamas and a dressing gown. Johnston judged him to be either drunk‘or on drugs’ (opiate medicines were at the time in common use). Johnston alsoremembers lunching with Rhodes in the Cape Parliament with members of thecabinet and ‘finding most of them drunk’. The extent of such drunkenness in theearly 1890s was ‘unbelievable’, Johnston wrote. ‘Jameson drank too much – he wasan absolute sot,’ he categorically states, while Rutherfoord Harris, ‘agood-looking man with a pleasant manner’, was oft times ‘a furious inebriate’.One of the secretaries, Le Sueur, wrote: ‘No stranger to brandy, Rhodes drank aspecial champagne before lunch, sometimes mixing it with stout.’ Brandy and sodainvariably preceded dinner where wines, both red and white, were served,followed by port for the men. According to Le Sueur, Rhodes habitually downedfive or six glasses of Russian Kümmel liqueur after dinner, and would havewhisky and soda to see him to bed. In London in 1891, Sir Charles Mills, a SouthAfrican diplomat, had noted that Rhodes drank a whole bottle of chartreuse inone sitting. Keir Hardie, a Labour MP who admittedly was no fan of Rhodes,called him ‘a confirmed drunkard – a dipsomaniac – who had to be watched by hisfriends so that he might be fit for the duties of the hour’.By what standard should we judge Rhodes today? Heavy drinking was common amongrich men of the time. He certainly drank no more than Winston Churchill, whosedecision-making remained sound enough to win a war. In addition to his drinking,Rhodes was also what Le Sueur described as a ‘gross feeder’: ‘In the veldt heliked getting the joint in front of him and cutting off great chunks of meat. Athome he would go to the sideboard and carve for himself and carry over to hisplate on his fork what he had carved.’ Herbert Baker’s insights are especiallytelling: ‘He used to eat and drink with absent-minded carelessness, swallowingfood as he swallowed continents.’ Rhodes was virtually a chain-smoker, too, andhis preference was for nicotine-rich Turkish tobacco.We are left with the paradox: the ‘sickly’ youth who arrived in the Umkomaasvalley two decades previously was now embarking on safaris across the wilds ofMashonaland, Matabeleland and Bechuanaland. When Rhodes picked up his telegraphat Fort Victoria – there was nothing more than an operator in a tent with aMorse code machine – he scrabbled urgently through the mail, anxious for news ofhis multifarious interests in the outside world. He had been in terra incognitafor more than a month and there were dozens of cables, but only one that trulyinterested him. Stead had telegraphed that the core committee of the SecretSociety in England – the ‘Elect’ – had been confirmed. He had laid thefoundation stone of Rhodes’s immortality."},{"pageContent":"14The Society of the ElectThe Secret Society of Cecil John Rhodes was called home to its new base inLondon by W.T. Stead, following his appointment in the fifth will of 1891 askeeper of Rhodes’s kingdom, with Lord Rothschild keeper of Rhodes’s purse. TheSociety had left its African roots, and with its new status as a bondedbrotherhood in Stead’s capable hands, it became a permanent and powerful corpsin the British political and diplomatic establishment – and has remained so eversince.Rhodes’s Secret Society has – perhaps inevitably – been confused with variousLondon clubs and cliques that went by a variety of names. Included among thesewere the Rosebery Group, the Coefficients Club and the Monday Night Cabal.Rhodes’s Secret Society had considerable influence in all of these even beforeStead formalised it as the Society of the Elect. Its homosexual links can betraced clearly to William ‘Tute’ Johnson Cory, who had been a tutor at Eton. Byall accounts a teacher of great genius and poet of much merit, severalgenerations of pupils owed their inspiration to him. But he has also beendescribed as the ‘groom’ of the cult of Victorian pederasty. He is the bestknown of the Uranian poets, an obscure, secretive school of gay and bisexualwriters. In 1858 Cory published a book of poems, Ionica, dedicated to one of hispupils, the ‘pretty-faced’ Edward Wood, later Lord Halifax. The latter wasclosely connected to the Rhodes Society in England, a fact that is explored inthe chapters ahead.A second volume, Ionica II, was privately published in 1877, causing a stir atOxford, where ‘aestheticism’ was all the rage. Wilde himself wrote verse inCory’s style, as did his lover Bosie. The book generated much interest inpederasty, with many defending it on the basis that affection between people ofthe same sex is no less natural and rational than ordinary passionaterelationships. In 1872, however, William Cory was forced to resign from histutorship under suspicion of improper relations with boys. The names of allthese boys remained a well-kept secret – certainly for the rest of Victoria’sreign.Then in 1924, a book titled Ionicus was published, and it was dedicated toWilliam Johnson Cory. The author was Reginald Baliol Brett, whose dedicationdiscloses a devotion to Cory as a teenager. This dedication also mentions threeBritish prime ministers: Lord Rosebery, Lord Balfour and Lord Asquith, ‘Who atEton learnt the elements of high politics from IONICUS’. That was not all theylearnt, however, for Cory had groomed these and many other influential men athis club called The Trap.W.T. Stead ensured that the new Secret Society would be more circumspect thanRhodes’s earlier band of brothers. He was determined to realise the imperialambitions Rhodes had laid down two decades previously in his Confession ofFaith. Brett’s Journals give us a sense of these early meetings with Rhodes: ‘Along talk with Rhodes today. He has vast ideas. Imperial notions. He seemsdisinterested but he is very ruse and I suspect, quite unscrupulous as to themeans he employs.’ And in an 1891 entry, Brett refers to Rhodes considering aclandestine group, a ‘secret league of the English race’ modelled almostentirely on the Gordon proposal. Brett records his own proposal that thereshould be a ‘pyramid’ system of recruitment whereby each new member would beexpected to find two more members, and so on. He had explained to Rhodes: ‘Itcould begin with you and might roll up indefinitely!’Stead himself records that the new group would be called the Society of theElect, with Rhodes as general (thus echoing Loyola of the Jesuits). Under thegeneral, he proposed a hierarchy: * A Junta of Three: Stead, Brett and Alfred Milner. * A Circle of Initiates: Cardinal Newman, Cardinal Manning, General Booth, Bramwell Booth, Harry ‘Little’ Johnston, Albert Grey and Arthur Balfour. The membership was to be secret. * An Association of Helpers (to be recruited).A college would also be established ‘to train people in the English-speakingideal’. (Significantly, a similar institution was set up by the Rhodes Trust.)Rhodes agreed to this structural plan, handed over a good deal of cash, andStead went off to see Alfred Milner, who was, according to Stead, ‘filled withadmiration for the scheme’. Subsequently, Rhodes revealed the secret proposal toRothschild and Little Johnston. Rhodes suggested that the Society adopt secretsigns, oaths and mystical initiations, but Milner and Brett vetoed this,claiming the Society would be more secure if its inner circles operated secretlyand separately. It is likely that the Circle of Initiates was nothing more thana wish list, and that Cardinal Newman, General Booth and his son Bramwell maynever actually have joined. Newman died in 1892, and the name Booth does notcome up at all in the posthumous letters and journals of members of the group.* * *The core society went underground, its ‘spoor’ later to be traced by theAmerican academic Professor Carroll Quigley. Fortunately, Quigley’s academiccredentials are excellent. Having studied history at Harvard, he taught thereand at Princeton before being appointed Professor of the School of ForeignService at Georgetown University in Washington. He served as consultant to theUS Department of Defense, the House Committee on Astronautics and SpaceExploration, and the US Navy, inter alia. Professor Quigley has over the yearsquietly – and secretly – researched several institutions established by theSecret Society after Rhodes’s death, which by now included the names of severalheads of state. Without Quigley’s efforts, the trail would have long grown coldand might even be untraceable.In the chronology of the story of Rhodes’s Secret Society, Quigley exists in thefar future. However, it is useful to introduce him at this point because ofcomments he made about the formation of the English-based Secret Society in1891. Quigley was the first political historian to take the Secret Society as amatter of fact and to strip it of the layers which had kept it secret. Hediscovered a tangle, which he proceeded systematically to unpick. His task wasmade more difficult by the fact that the Society had a habit of going quiet forlong periods and then flaring into brisk activity – moments usually associatedwith Rhodes’s activities in Rhodesia.In 1895, for example, there is clear proof that the English Secret Society isactive, for Stead requested Rhodes to endow the Association of Helpers with anannual income of £5,000. Rhodes was otherwise occupied with a crisis inRhodesia, so was unable to oblige right then. Nevertheless, he promised Steadthat he would soon institute their scheme for the formation of a ‘college’, forlibraries, lectureships, the acquisition of a newspaper, and ‘the dispatch ofemissaries on missions of propagandism throughout the Empire’. Rhodes dideventually make good on his promise, and a few years later a powerful emissary,George R. Parkin, a friend of Milner’s from his Balliol days and a fanaticalsupporter of the imperial federation, began touring the world on Rhodes’s money.The problem with the Secret Society is that it does not fit in with the imageRhodes had achieved almost overnight with his conquest of Rhodesia. He was theColossus, and no writer was prepared to subvert this heroic image. Theycertainly never revealed that Rhodes was the general of a powerful clandestinesociety run along semi-religious lines. Quigley’s revelations thus fell likebombshells on this protected territory, despite his impeccable credentials. Hisexpertise was, indeed, recognised by Bill Clinton, Quigley’s former student atGeorgetown, and a Rhodes Scholar. Clinton commended Quigley in his presidentialnomination speech in 1981 – ninety years after the Secret Society was first setup in England.As a teenager, I heard John Kennedy’s summons to citizenship. And then, as astudent at Georgetown, I heard that call clarified by a professor named CarrollQuigley, who said to us that America was the greatest Nation in history becauseour people had always believed in two things – that tomorrow can be better thantoday and that every one of us has a personal moral responsibility to make itso.Carroll Quigley described himself as a liberal conservative, and as suchappealed to Democrats like Clinton. He was Clinton’s mentor, and, thereafter, aCold War expert respected across the nation as one of the leading political andmilitary analysts of the era.For others, however, Quigley sails too close to the wind. His 1966 study,Tragedy and Hope: A History of the World in Our Time, is an apocalyptic tomewhich contains revelatory information on Rhodes’s Secret Society, as well as itsevolution under Stead, Milner and an expanding cartel of the most powerful andwealthy people on the planet. The book’s content caused conspiracy theorists tocome wheeling in like flocks of ravenous ravens, the eventual upshot being theend of any claim to credibility, causing sales to plummet, although the book hassince then become something of a cult classic. The reaction appeared to scareoff the publisher too, with Quigley claiming:The original edition published by Macmillan in 1966 sold about 8,800 copies andsales were picking up in 1968 when they ‘ran out of stock’, as they told me. In1974, when I went after them with a lawyer, they told me that they had destroyedthe plates in 1968. They lied to me for six years, telling me that they wouldre-print when they got 2,000 orders, which could never happen because they toldanyone who asked that it was out of print and would not be reprinted. Powerfulinfluences in this country want me, or at least my work, suppressed.Certainly by the time he died in 1977, Quigley felt persecuted: his book hadbeen blighted, condemned to obscurity by critics, and its author labelled anarch conspiracy theorist. These accusations are, however, patently untrue andfor the simplest of reasons: the most basic internet research providesinformation on the Secret Society that Rhodes set up with Stead, Brett andMilner. It is as well to remember, however, that conspiracy theories are likequicksand: however warily one may approach, there is the ever-present danger ofbeing sucked down. Quigley himself never expected his tome to become so belovedof conspiracy theorists. When it was espoused by the John Birch Society as beingsupportive of their belief in a worldwide Jewish conspiracy, Quigley vehementlyprotested, but to little avail.There is some evidence that Quigley was persecuted in the latter years of hiscareer, though there are also indications that this was partly of his ownmaking. In the event, he stopped teaching his acclaimed course ‘Development ofCivilisation’ – which had so impressed young Clinton – when the universityattached ‘unacceptable conditions’ to it. Was this a covert attack by partieswhose interests he had exposed in Tragedy and Hope and a 1981 version of thebook, The Anglo-American Establishment, or was it simply the pique of aneccentric professor in the twilight of his career?There is seldom smoke without fire, however, and one cannot help wonderingwhether Quigley, for most of his life at the pinnacle of American politicalresearch, was not initially at least part of the very system he went on toexpose. Quigley admitted to being an enthusiastic supporter of the aims of the‘Milner Group’: ‘I feel that the British way of life and the BritishCommonwealth of Nations are among the great achievements of all history. I feelthat the destruction of either of them would be a terrible disaster to mankind.’Though this chimes with Rhodes’s Confession of Faith, Quigley goes on to delivera telling critique of the Secret Society:Agreeing with the Group on goals, I cannot agree with them on methods. To besure I realize that some of their methods were based on nothing but goodintentions and high ideals – higher ideals than mine, perhaps. But their lack ofperspective in critical moments, their failure to use intelligence and commonsense, their tendency to fall back on standardized social reactions and verbalclichés in a crisis, their tendency to place power and influence into handschosen by friendship rather than merit, their oblivion to the consequences oftheir actions, their ignorance of the point of view of persons in othercountries or of persons of other classes in their own country – these things itsseems to me have brought many of the things which they hold dear close todisaster.While Quigley’s opinions are interesting, it is his deep and detailed researchthat is of real significance, for it shows that the Secret Society was not amyth, as the next few chapters reveal.* * *The extraordinary year of 1891 finally drew to an end and Rhodes could turn hismind to other things, not least the only house and garden he ever owned – andthe only woman he ever seemed to like. The house was Groote Schuur, and thefemale friend was Olive Schreiner, author of The Story of an African Farm, anovel that Rhodes greatly admired. There may be a certain amount of intriguehere too, however, for Schreiner – whose affair with Rhodes was platonic –conducted an equally intimate correspondence with W.T. Stead which may cast herin the role of ‘double agent’. Whether she was in fact a member of the SecretSociety – women joined the Circle of Initiates and the Association of Friends –is doubtful, though she did keep an eye on Rhodes for Stead.Schreiner represents a turning point in Rhodes’s sexual and emotional life, forwhen his relationship with her ended, he chose a road for himself that he neverdeviated from. They were not entirely unsuited. Schreiner, braver and moreadventurous than Rhodes, espoused and practised lesbianism and was quite openabout her sexual preferences. Rhodes was a closed book when it came to sex, butthe Schreiner affair reveals that he did at least contemplate opening the book –and with an attractive woman, at that. More importantly, however, Rhodes wasnever quite the same after his dalliance with Olive Schreiner, though manybiographers have put this down to a nasty fall from a horse at about that time.Two other elements of the story which have become somewhat distorted may also berectified here. Firstly, according to Jameson, Schreiner ‘downright proposed’when walking with Rhodes on Table Mountain and Rhodes ‘turned and fled’. This isnot true at all, and may be explained as jealousy on Jameson’s part. The fact isthat for many months to come Rhodes continued to see Schreiner, taking her onrides round the peninsula and dining with her privately.1[part0037.html#ch14fn-1] No one will ever know what attracted Rhodes toSchreiner, for he took that secret to the grave; but he definitely saw a lot ofher, spending much more time with her than with any other woman. For her part,Schreiner fancied Rhodes for at least two years, until they had a mighty fallingout over his race politics.The role of W.T. Stead in their relationship is intriguing, especially since, bythe end of 1891, he already had an enormous vested interest in Rhodes. It maywell have been Stead who set the pair up. He found it useful to engage women assecret agents – the degree to which he manipulated the Princess Radziwill is astory still to come – and, as his published letters reveal, Stead was in onRhodes’s relationship with Schreiner from the start.2 [part0037.html#ch14fn-2]Olive Schreiner ostensibly returned from England to South Africa and the GreatKaroo, where her famous novel is set, because of her asthma. She was also on therebound from a disastrous affair with a bisexual academic, Karl Pearson. But herdecision to live in the remote dorp of Matjiesfontein – little more than arailway siding – raises a flag. Stead’s correspondence with Schreiner dates fromjust before this time. It is clear from other correspondence that Stead andBramwell Booth had made their feelings known that Rhodes should marry – to takethe ‘married option’ as Regy Brett and Lord Rosebery had done. Wandering theworld with his lambs was causing too much exposure, and threatening Rhodes’sreputation.The dorp where Schreiner chose to settle was Rhodes’s town down to the lastbrick. He always overnighted there on his journeys because it had a telegraphpoint and the only grand hotel for hundreds of miles. Significantly, he had gotinto political hot water for granting its builder, James Logan, a lease to buildthe hotel, which his accusers said amounted to a bribe. The Lord Milner Hotel isstill an excellent traveller’s stopover, a unique historic Victorian landmark inthe grand semi-desert of the Great Karoo.Schreiner may well have set out to ensnare Rhodes, with Matjiesfontein thecentre of her web. If this was the case, then the secret matchmaker wascertainly Stead, who was also protecting his own interests. Schreiner herselfconfirms her interest in Rhodes in a letter to Havelock Ellis: ‘I am going tomeet Cecil Rhodes, the only great man and man of genius in South Africa. If hebacks me up at all I shall be able to carry out my plan.’ She had a strongdesire to write an account as she followed in the path of the Voortrekkers.En route to Rhodesia, Rhodes stopped by at Matjiesfontein and invited Schreinerto dine with him. The person who set up this meeting may well have been Stead,for his fingerprints are all over it. Stead and Schreiner were writing to eachother at the time, though what this was about no one has ever satisfactorilyexplained. A letter Schreiner wrote to Stead is, however, telling: ‘There aretimes when one loves to rub one’s brains against another human’s. There areplenty of women and children and niggers to love here, but sometimes one wantsthe other side of one’s nature satisfied, that thinks.’Schreiner and Rhodes had much in common and would have found much to talk about.She was writing a series of essays which were later published as Thoughts onSouth Africa. There was also her ‘monumental sex book’: somewhat weird anderotic, it proposed a brave new world where ‘lower beings’ conform to the sexualmores of ‘those of a higher state of evolution’. This was the stuff of theimagination of H.G. Wells and George Bernard Shaw – two writers who will alsofind their place in Rhodes’s story. Rhodes himself enjoyed discussing thesetopics, as Schreiner reports to Stead, thereby signalling her emotions too: ‘Ifeel a curious and almost painfully intense interest in the man. It’s not love,it’s not admiration … it’s not that I think him noble or good … it’s thedeliberate feeling: “That man belongs to me.”’Rhodes made every effort to see Schreiner whenever time and opportunitypermitted. She herself visited Groote Schuur frequently and always occupied aprivileged seat at the dinner table, most notably on the occasion of a granddinner for Lord Randolph Churchill. Rhodes took her out in his trap for scenictours around the beautiful Cape Peninsula and he offered to pay for her plannedtrek into the interior. Then there is also an enigmatic pencilled note fromSchreiner in which she refers to a letter of an apparently intimate nature: ‘Ihave suffered the agony of a lost spirit about it ever since. Please forgive meand don’t mention it to me.’ The Irish MP, Swifty MacNeill, who had gone to CapeTown to collect the £10,000 Rhodes had donated to the Irish nationalists,3[part0037.html#ch14fn-3] warmly records Schreiner’s vibrancy around Rhodes,declaring that she ‘seemed to speak on the spur of the moment in a style asperfect and sparkling as that of her writings’. However, in spite of thisapparent intimacy, Rhodes was by now keeping Schreiner at arm’s length,suggesting that her enigmatic note may have referred to some kind of rejectionof a marriage proposal. It also provides some support for Jameson’s belief thatSchreiner’s advances had been rejected by Rhodes.Rhodes journeyed to Rhodesia, neither telling Schreiner when he would return norinviting her to join him. Her ‘trek’ seems to have been put on the back-burnerand she expresses concern about Rhodes, writing to Stead: ‘Any accident to himwould, I believe, mean the putting back of our South African development forfifty years.’ This reveals a direct concern with politics, the same politicsPrincess Radziwill appeared secretly to promote on Stead’s behalf whenSchreiner’s suit failed. Two months later, Schreiner reported – withconsiderable relief – Rhodes’s safe return.With Stead now running the Secret Society, he would have welcomed more controlover Rhodes, and he would have preferred a wife for Rhodes that he mightinfluence to the gaggle of lambs who were already beginning to resent him.Schreiner was obviously happy to conspire with Stead, and it is unlikely Rhodeshad any suspicions about their correspondence. Her interference in Rhodes’scircle – and whether wittingly or not, with the business of the Secret Society –led to a monumental row. She urged Rhodes to break with associates likeRutherfoord Harris, who had shipped guns to Lobengula, but an infuriated Rhodesforbade her to interfere in his friendships. On another occasion when Rhodes hadstopped to see her in Matjiesfontein, Schreiner refused to dine with him and hisfriends. ‘I saw … that Rhodes had deliberately chosen evil and that I could notsave him,’ she later told her sister. In 1894 Schreiner married Samuel C.Cronwright, though by then Stead may have lost interest in her as he too wasbeginning to fall out with Rhodes on key issues and would, in turn, be writtenout of Rhodes’s will.Rhodes maintained his loyalty to the friends Schreiner disapproved of, and whowere generally uncritical of him, unlikely to tell the emperor he had no clotheson. Rhodes clearly preferred the company of his male cronies. Mavericks likeJameson and Willoughby, whisperers like Charlie Metcalfe and F. Edmund Garrett,and the ever-present lambs, increasingly limited his contact with more balanced,less sycophantic company.* * *Late in 1891 Rhodes fell from his horse while out riding with Merriman and therewas talk that he had suffered a cardiovascular stroke. Soon afterwards therewere two concussion episodes – another horse-riding accident, and the secondfrom a cart overturning. The myth of fragile health was given a fillip andRhodes’s biographers neatly date his decline from this time. However, records atGroote Schuur reveal that this number of accidents was normal in an age whenthere was no other transport but the horse, oxen or mule – especially if thevictim enjoyed his daily pint of alcohol.A few weeks after his first fall, Rhodes embarked on a two-month trek throughMozambique and Mashonaland which involved a three-week tramp across themalaria-infested Pungwe swamp and a climb into the Chimanimani Mountains. Theproblems he was facing in Rhodesia may well have affected his temper, hisdrinking, and his cardiovascular health. A year into the occupation, Rhodesiawas a shambles of mismanagement, starvation and corruption. Randolph Churchilldescribed it as ‘Barren and worthless … grievous for man or beast.’ Rhodesordered Jameson to fire two-thirds of the company’s police force, offeringchunks of land by way of compensation. Jameson was left with 400 men to policethe country, a force which now included the surly Matabele.Rhodes’s luck held, however, as the land proved bountiful. The savannahs wouldeventually produce maize and wheat in abundance, with Rhodesia producing moretobacco than anywhere else but America. Beef cattle thrived in the lowlandsnorth of Bulawayo. Fruit grew prolifically in the eastern districts under theVumba and Chimanimani Mountains, and the forests provided large quantities ofvaluable hardwoods like teak and mahogany. Even the barren old gold mines beganto respond to modern mining techniques. The dream expressed in the Confession ofFaith finally started to come true for Rhodes when a steady stream ofEnglish-speaking immigrants began to flow from the overcrowded working-classareas of England – including four near-penniless Browns from the backstreets ofBrighton who arrived in an old army truck in the middle of the century.But in 1891 Rhodes realised that unless he returned to England at least asquickly as doomsayers like Randolph Churchill, it would all come crumbling roundhis ears as investors pulled out. Leaving Fort Victoria, he travelled southwardsin a light ox-drawn cart for a fleeting meeting with the Bechuana chief Kgama,then changed to a speedier mule-drawn stagecoach for the middle part of thejourney. The party covered 4,000 miles in three months, travelling the final 625miles from Tuli to Shippard’s house in Vryburg in seven days and six hours – asouthern African record. His fellow parliamentarian, a tough Boer named De Waal,later exclaimed: ‘No one else had before completed that distance in so short atime with only draught animals and, I may safely assert, no one ever will.’To save the Charter Company, Rhodes had to counter Churchill’s damning reports,and he went about it in his usual manner. Using 20,000 acres of prime Rhodesianland as an inducement, he managed to square the influential E.A. Maund, the manwho had brought Lobengula’s letter to the Queen and returned with her reply. Hewas no crony of Rhodes, and his was a voice to be trusted. And so, with whatRhodes described as untiring energy, Maund worked the shareholder circuit,calming nerves while Jameson curtailed expenditure and provided assurances thathe could run the country on £3,000 a month.Rhodes reassured Charter Company shareholders: he had completed the telegraphservice, which would also make a profit; settlers were buying building plots inthe towns; the country was ‘mineralised throughout’; and he was also starting tobuild a railway from Beira. ‘We are on the most friendly terms with Lobengula,’Rhodes lied in 1892 with Maund – trusted emissary to both Victoria and Lobengula– at his side. ‘I have not the least fear of any trouble with Lobengula,’ heboasted. This at the very moment when the Matabele were well advanced with theirplans for an uprising and Jameson knowing full well that trouble was brewing –that Lobengula was in fact spoiling for a fight. Throughout his administration,Jameson had meted out harsh retribution against native infractions of his laws.In 1893, following the death of a white trader, nearby villages were razed tothe ground. Later that year, when a white merchant alleged theft and claimed hehad been assaulted by Shona villagers, Jameson dispatched Captain C.F. Lendywith a seven-pound cannon and a Maxim machine gun to teach the villagers whatLendy described as a ‘very wholesome lesson’: twenty-three Africans weremassacred that day.The British government reacted with shock and horror in public statements. Butbehind the scenes they placed their representative at the Cape, Governor SirHenry Loch, on war alert when Jameson reported that a vast Matabele impi had setout for Mashonaland. Jameson had in fact concocted the story and embarked uponhis own plans for war. Throughout August and September that year, Jameson boughthorses for his settler militia, promising them 3,000 morgen in Matabeleland,five alluvial gold claims, as well as a share of the enormous herds of Matabelecattle.Sensing war, Lobengula attempted to send a peace mission to Queen Victoria, butGovernor Loch prevented his emissaries from boarding in Cape Town. Not realisingthat the Matabele raiders were a ruse on the part of Jameson, Loch informed himand Rhodes that they had British permission to go to war. Rhodes, with CharlesMetcalfe and Gordon le Sueur, then set out secretly for Rhodesia, again via theeast coast route and Beira. A two-foot guage railroad had been laid across thePungwe marshes, enabling Rhodes to race through the mosquitoes and tsetse fliesas far as Willoughby’s newly built road that led up into the mountains. A dashacross Mashonaland brought them to a bush camp outside Salisbury where Rhodeswent into hiding, fearing a recall from the imperial government. Once again, onewonders: Where, in all of this, is the Rhodes of the weak heart and consumptivelungs?The whole party waited incognito for several days until a mounted policemanbrought word: Jameson had launched his first attack on the Matabele on 25September 1893 at Shangani, fifty-five miles from Bulawayo, using five Maxims,three rapid-fire Gardner guns, two cannons and 200 rifles. The carnage wasdreadful, and no one knows exactly how many Matabele died that day. Five dayslater the Matabele lined up regiments numbering in excess of 6,000 warriorsagainst Jameson’s weaponry. The killing was repeated as wave upon wave ofMatabele advanced in disciplined ranks into a ‘hailstorm’ – as one capturedwarrior described it – of bullets and exploding shells. The Matabele, thougharmed with their newly acquired Martini-Henri rifles, generally preferred theirspears and useless shields. This time there was a headcount of the casualties:800 Matabele – and three whites. The Times correspondent praised the Matabelefor their bravery.Bulawayo fell on 4 November, and Jameson marched into a deserted town. Lobengulafled north with the remnants of his army until he reached a spot near theconfluence of the Shangani and Zambezi rivers, where he died of hypothermia, or,some say, by his own hand. Cecil Rhodes rode triumphantly to Bulawayo, enteringthe conquered capital of his new territory at the head of a uniformed escort oftwenty white soldiers of the Cape Mounted Rifles. Reporting Rhodes’s triumph,Stead made a rough estimate of the land Rhodes had added to Rhodesia, concludingit was approximately the size of Germany. The one stumbling block to Rhodes’stakeover of the whole of south-central Africa had been eliminated in a week,with Rhodes praising the settler militia: ‘Nine hundred of you have effected thedestruction of ruthless barbarianism and created a further extension of theBritish Empire, and all this by your own unaided efforts.’This was a triumph for the Secret Society too. Rhodes reminded those in Britainwho had vilified the settler soldiers as ‘freebooting marauders and bloodthirstymurderers’ that this merely reflected the manner in which ‘some in themother-country had once lost us America’ – thereby echoing his Confession ofFaith. Moreover, the Secret Society’s longest-serving acolyte, Rhodes’s belovedJameson, had been proven loyal, devoted and correct in his judgement.Rhodes took his time joining Jameson, arriving in Bulawayo on 4 December, amonth after the town fell. The delay provoked an angry response from his friend:‘Where the devil have you come from?’ Rhodes, more adept politically thanJameson, had been keeping the ‘Imperial Factor’ at bay. From Fort Victoria, hehad cabled Jameson in Bulawayo: ‘Retain management for the Company.’ He thencabled Sir Henry Loch – who had insisted on discussing arrangements for the‘British’ administration of the conquered territory – to say that he would meethim in the border town of Tati. But he failed to keep his appointment. SkirtingTati, Rhodes rode straight back to Bulawayo, where he celebrated his victorywith Jameson.Jameson, puffed up by his victory, was unconcerned with diplomatic niceties. Sohe and Rhodes sat down to toast each other with some of Lobengula’s abandonedchampagne – utterly unaware, however, that a genie would emerge from one ofthese bottles which would soon destroy the pair of them. And as for OliveSchreiner, she no sooner had news of Rhodes’s role in these events than she gaveup on him once and for all."},{"pageContent":"15The Jameson RaidVictory against all odds – as the 1896 Matabele Campaign was perceived – savedRhodes’s reputation in Britain and made Jameson a hero. Jameson’s Maxims hadavenged Lord Chelmsford’s bloody defeat at the hands of the Zulus at Isandlwana.There was suddenly a rosy tint to Rhodes’s activities in Africa. Queen Victoriaand her ministers, who had been not altogether happy with Rhodes’s freebootingimperialism, particularly with regard to Jameson’s attacks on the Portuguese,were now forced by public jingoism to applaud Jameson’s massacres. Paul Kruger,looking at Rhodes’s vast new territory, and suspecting that Jameson might alsohave the Transvaal in his sights, used revenue from his newfound gold to buyGerman weaponry. The Kaiser saw colonial gains for Germany and was all too happyto accommodate the Transvaal president.Meanwhile in the Cape, trouble was brewing. Rhodes’s attempts to form analliance with the Dutch and to federate all the countries of the south were notgoing well. The Dutch shared a heritage with the northern Boers and weresympathetic to Kruger’s fears. They suspected that Jameson, together withRhodes, was fomenting rebellion among the thousands of European miners –Uitlanders who had come to Johannesburg to mine gold. Then there was Jamesonhimself. Always ‘insanely brave’, though perhaps somewhat more insane thancourageous, Jameson now regarded himself as the little Caesar of central Africa,the flag-bearer of Rhodes’s dreams. And soon enough, one unholy dawn a fewmonths hence, he would lead a small but lethal army on a march to the Transvaalborder.The Jameson Raid changed not just African but world history. Had the raidsucceeded, the two Boer republics – the Transvaal and the Orange Free State –would have ceased to exist. The Uitlanders comprised an electoral majority inthe Transvaal in any case, so with Jameson in charge they would simply havevoted themselves back into Rhodes’s Cape. The vast fortune being hauled up fromgold mines around Johannesburg would have been available for Rhodes and the CapeParliament to tax and spend at will. Still relatively young and vigorous, Rhodeswould have had the time and the political influence to paint much of thecontinent red – all the way to Cairo. The Cape Dutch would meanwhile haveregained influence over the Boers who had trekked away, joining with Rhodes toform a federation of South African states – the first stage in the SecretSociety’s plan for a world federation of English-speaking dominions.Furthermore, the Anglo-Boer War that followed in the wake of the raid, and whichdamaged British colonial confidence and accelerated the collapse of the Empire,would never have taken place. And then there was the legacy of English hatred ofGermany, which had been provoked by the Kaiser’s condemnation of Jameson, andwas still festering when Britain was dragged into the Great War in 1914. Hadthis legacy not existed, the ‘appeasers’ of later years – who are players inthis story – might have prevailed with Hitler and prevented the Second WorldWar.As things turned out, however, after the abortive raid, Rhodes was forced toresign, both as prime minister of the Cape and also as chairman of the CharterCompany. But if this had not happened, with gold and diamonds in his pocket plusthe support of a grateful Britain, ‘Rhodes of Rhodesia’ may well have completedhis plans as, together with Little Johnston, he extended British hegemonythrough the Great Lakes region, Uganda and the Sudan. In that case, he wouldquite likely be remembered today as ‘Rhodes of Africa’.Were it not for the raid and the damage it caused to Rhodes’s reputation, he mayhave gone ahead, possibly aiming at becoming prime minister in the BritishParliament. South Africa was already being used by Rhodes and Milner as apolitical training ground – indeed, Milner himself eventually came very close tooccupying the top position in Britain.* * *The raid began with a letter written in November 1894 in which a group known asthe Reformers – mainly business leaders – appealed to Jameson to come to therescue of the Uitlanders, ‘thousands of unarmed men, women and children of ourrace in the greatest of peril. All feel we are justified in taking steps toprevent the shedding of blood and to ensure the protection of our rights.’Jameson made a special trip to Johannesburg to pick up a copy of the letter,which was deliberately undated. ‘An Intelligence department was created,’ writesSarah Gertrude Millin. ‘A code was arranged … Everywhere strong men, not sosilent as they might have been, were rushing by train, horse and bicycle. Alongall the wires telegrams in code were buzzing.’ The hand of the Secret Societywas much in evidence, and, with a somewhat ironic glint in her eye, Millinobserves: ‘Rutherfoord Harris returned from England and put a really imaginativemind to the code. He sent for instance, one urgent telegram about the veterinaryfor his horses, signed Godolphin. Who was Godolphin, it wasn’t in the code? Didanyone remember that Godolphin was Shippard’s second Christian name?’British complicity in the plan, though never admitted, is undisputed. The Timescorrespondents in South Africa acted as secret couriers for the Secret Society,carrying correspondence back and forth to Rhodes in the Cape from his frontlinenegotiator in Johannesburg, Rutherfoord Harris. The Times’s main correspondent,Flora Shaw, even had a major say in the actual timing of the raid, for ‘Rhodesnow controlled wholly, or in part, all the important newspapers in SouthAfrica,’ as Millin observes. Flora Shaw herself acted as Rhodes’s direct conduitto the British government, and she cabled Rhodes about the foreign secretary:‘Chamberlain sound in case of interference European powers, but have specialreasons to believe you must do it immediately.’ Later on, Shaw urged Rhodes:‘Delay dangerous. Sympathy now complete, but will depend very much upon actionbefore European Powers given time to enter a protest, which, as Europeansituation considered serious, might paralyse Government. General feeling onStock Market very suspicious.’A looming crisis over which only Rhodes had any kind of control was about tolapse into farce. Buoyed up by the success of the Maxims in Matabeleland,Jameson decided to take matters into his own hands. With no hard evidence thatan Uitlander uprising awaited him in Johannesburg to support his plannedtakeover, Jameson simply set out from Pitsani with his small band of soldiersafter he failed to get a reply to his last cable to Cape Town: ‘Shall leavetonight for the Transvaal.’ But Rhodes had in fact replied: ‘Things inJohannesburg I yet hope to get settled, and a little common sense are onlynecessary. On no account whatever must you move. I strongly object to such acourse.’However, it was Christmas time, and the Intelligence Office staff inJohannesburg were on holiday, as was Rutherfoord Harris, who had gone to CapeTown. And so, Rhodes’s telegram did not reach Jameson. Not that this would havemade any difference, though: Jameson had already dispatched an advance group tocut the telegraph wires around Johannesburg and Pretoria, where Kruger waswatching and listening for an incursion. In a moment of true farce, however, thewire-cutters outside Pretoria who had methodically set to work cutting and thenburying wires were in fact cutting a farmer’s fence! ‘Accordingly,’ observesMillin, ‘the only person who knew all about Jameson’s movements was PresidentKruger in Pretoria.’And so it was that on Boxing Day in 1895, a group of men under Jameson’s commandcrossed the border into the Transvaal to tip the scales on world events. Thiswas not the force of 1,500 that Rhodes had promised – fewer than 500 hadstraggled out of Pitsani. As ever, Jameson remained chipper. ‘You could take theTransvaal with a brace of revolvers,’ he had once told a journalist. And it wasindeed true that, by 1895 at least, Britons and English-speakers outnumberedAfrikaners in the gold-rich Boer republic, with the Uitlanders beingconcentrated in Johannesburg, a village which had grown almost overnight into atown.Whenever the Uitlanders walked the streets, or gathered at bars, or turned up atmeetings to air their many grievances against the hostile administration of the‘illiterate’ Oom Paul, they knew that they constituted a political majority.Yet, they claimed, Kruger treated them as ‘white trash’: immigrant workers whowere no better than the Africans who came to work his mines. Moreover, theUitlanders were denied the vote but were heavily taxed. It was a recipe forrevolt.Rhodes too had just received news that gave him a vital interest in this fetidbrew. In September of that year he, together with Jameson, Willoughby and a topAmerican mining engineer, John Hays Hammond, had finally found the time toinspect ‘Ophir’ at Great Zimbabwe as well as thousands of nearby abandoned goldmines. Hammond concluded that these Rhodesian reefs in no way compared to thoseof the Rand. He advised Rhodes to concentrate his efforts and his funds on thestill under-explored Transvaal. The Rand reefs were unique, he opined, and wouldbe productive for decades, making multi-millionaires of Rhodes, Rudd, Barnatoand Beit if they moved fast enough.These riches would of course also secure the fortunes of the mismanagedTransvaal under President Kruger. If that were to happen, Rhodes’s ultimatedream of a federated Africa under British rule would be shattered, and he wouldbe competing with wealthy German-armed Boers for control of the Africanhinterland. Consequently, the plight of the Uitlanders was identified by theSecret Society as sufficient justification for its plot to eliminate Oom Pauland his republic. As Stead observed: ‘When [Rhodes] left England everythingseemed to point to his being able to carry out his greater scheme, when weshould be able to undertake the propagation of “our ideas” on a wider scalethroughout the world.’ This observation, published after Rhodes’s death, is thefirst real confirmation of the Secret Society functioning in Britain with Steadat its helm, and that it was working towards a ‘greater scheme’ that embracedthe world.With Stead promoting the Secret Society, and with the sympathetic support of‘dozens of important others’, in Rotberg’s terms, Rhodes and the foreignsecretary Joseph Chamberlain ‘hatched a tendentious and risky scheme to subvertPresident Kruger’s hold on the Transvaal and make, by an invasion linked to anarmed revolt, that interior Afrikaner stronghold British’.1[part0037.html#ch15fn-1] While this is speculation on the part of Rotberg, andonly circumstantial evidence exists that Chamberlain was in cahoots with Rhodes,the claim does seem feasible. Indeed, Rhodes’s entire future hinged uponChamberlain’s support.For Chamberlain, the scheme was fraught with danger as both Britain and theBoers were under the watchful eye of the Kaiser and Chancellor Bismarck inGermany. Kruger presided over a recognised nation state, so for the primeminister of the Cape and an English privy councillor to conspire with theforeign secretary on a scheme to invade the Transvaal would amount to an act ofinternational piracy. It had all the potential of providing Germany with theexcuse she needed to go to war with Britain.Chamberlain and his cronies, who by now included Rhodes and Milner, did not takeKruger or his Boer republic very seriously, however. Instead, they regardedtheir continued existence as nothing more than the unfortunate consequence ofyears of indecision and inaction on the part of the Cape administration. Butthey hesitated in the face of German belligerence, deciding finally – atSalisbury’s prompting – that Chamberlain’s complicity in the planned raid shouldbe kept secret. As Salisbury put it to Chamberlain, the raid should seem‘entirely the result of the action of internal forces, and not of Cecil Rhodes’sintervention, nor of ours’.The numbers were on Rhodes’s side: there were 51,000 whites in Johannesburg,40,000 of whom were Uitlanders. So, with the support of the Secret Society,notably his brother Frank, and Rutherfoord Harris, Rhodes began shipping arms toJohannesburg which were hidden in oil drums and in crates packed onto coaltrucks. Colonel Frank Rhodes was also charged with raising and arming a secretarmy at a camp in sleepy Pitsani, 176 miles to the west. The recruitment wentslowly, dangerously slowly, with the result that Rhodes lost faith in hisbrother, never fully trusting him again. Rhodes had agreed to fund a force of7,500 – and Frank was only able to recruit some 300 men.Furthermore, it was coming up to Christmas. All the secret talk about anuprising and a fifth column was usually done over a bottle of brandy, and muchthe same was true at Jameson’s end. He had planned to march with well over 1,000trained soldiers and police, but in fact set out for Johannesburg with only 494men. But Jameson did at least have his Maxims, having hauled eight of them downfrom Rhodesia – and, he had persuaded himself, the Boers posed no real threat,having just a few cannons, elephant guns and rifles. ‘You do not know the Maximgun,’ Jameson told Frederick Hamilton, editor of the Johannesburg Star. ‘I willsimply blow [the Boers] away. I shall draw a zone of lead a mile on each side ofmy column and no Boer will live in it.’He gave command of the column to Rhodes’s devoted friend, John Willoughby, aformer transport officer and road builder in Rhodesia who had never commanded anattack force. But that mattered little to Jameson, for he himself would begiving the final orders. The key to the plan was that Jameson would begin themarch as soon as the Uitlander uprising took place in Johannesburg. Chamberlain,Rhodes, Harris, Stead and even Brett were all hostages to that plan, butJameson, arrogant as ever, the maverick who won against impossible odds, decidedotherwise. Rhodes, the squarer, the planner, the player of the long game, shouldhave anticipated that his friend would go at it alone. But Jameson had the vitalkey to Rhodes’s heart: loyalty. And loyalty was the one thing Rhodes banked on.While Kruger had a reputation for bluffing, then calling it off, this time heacted immediately, sending out a call to Boer farms for sharpshooters, andequipping them with Mauser rifles. Frank Rhodes stood by and wrung his hands,thereby demonstrating what Rhodes later described as the difference between ‘abrave soldier and a man for a crisis’. Meanwhile in England, Stead and Brett –the two other grand masters of what had evolved into the Society of the Elect –were busy harnessing support for Rhodes. Brett, as we know, was by this timeprivate secretary to Lord Hartington (later the 8th Duke of Devonshire) and inintimate contact with some of the highest aristocrats in the land, including theEarl of Ripon and his wife Frederica, who distinguished herself by providingcover for Brett’s love affairs with young boys.Henry Paulet, Marquess of Winchester and a hunting companion of Rhodes, suggeststhat the raid was planned at the Burlington Hotel by certain men we now knowbelonged to the inner circle of the Secret Society: Rhodes, Jameson, Maguireand, almost certainly, Paulet. The insiders may have included Lord Ripon,Brett’s erstwhile boss, who was at the time colonial secretary in the Liberalgovernment. And nor should one discount the prime minister, Lord Rosebery, a manwho shared with Rhodes not only a love of Empire but also – according to theMarquess of Queensberry – a love of men. Stead’s contribution was to check onRosebery. He reported to Brett that the prime minister was ill, and that he wasfinding his office a ‘crown of thorns’: his doctor had diagnosed him withinfluenza, as well as depression and chronic insomnia, and warned that he was onthe edge of mental collapse.Rosebery was perhaps haunted by an incident two years before, in 1893 – thefracas at Bad Homburg, where the Marquess of Queensberry had threatened tohorsewhip him for sodomising his eldest son Francis, who was at the timeRosebery’s handsome young secretary. The Wilde trials were far too close forRosebery’s comfort, as is clear from Brett’s journal entry regarding gossip fromthe Earl of Durham: ‘The Newmarket scum say that R. never had the influenza, andthat his insomnia was caused by terror of being in the Wilde scandal.’ ButRosebery (who kept several race horses) apparently persisted in hisunconventional behaviour. Some years later, Brett’s bisexual biographer JamesLees-Milne records that in 1898 Raymond Asquith quipped about Rosebery’s prettynew secretary, a young man called Waterman: ‘He inclines me to believe the worstof his illustrious master.’ Lees-Milne also reveals that Tute Cory had been‘intoxicated’ by Rosebery at Eton.Rhodes’s machinations resulted in the reappointment of the pliant though ailingSir Hercules Robinson as governor of the Cape in 1895. Rhodes demanded thatBritain annex Bechuanaland, or at least the strip adjoining the Transvaal, so asto facilitate the raid. Britain had always baulked at handing Bechuanaland overto Rhodes – though at one stage they did consider making it part of hisRhodesian Charter – but a change of government saved Rosebery from having tomake that decision. Lord Salisbury came to power, and the committed imperialistJoseph Chamberlain replaced Ripon in the Foreign Office. The new government waseven more wary of the planned raid than Rosebery and Ripon. Moreover, Brett wasnot as close to Chamberlain as he was to Ripon.Earl Grey, now chairman of the British South Africa Company, and RutherfoordHarris went immediately to the Foreign Office to press for the annexation ofBechuanaland. They were asked to detail their reasons, and the conversationwhich followed is generally regarded as the moment when Chamberlain becamecomplicit in the Jameson Raid. A secret telegram from Rhodes to Chamberlainseems to suggest it was Chamberlain who proposed the transfer to Rhodes of thestrip of land where Pitsani was situated as it would assist Jameson. Stead wasalso operating behind the scenes. He had helped Flora Shaw to get the jobreporting for The Times in South Africa, and she immediately started to lobbyfor Rhodes, assuring Chamberlain that the newspaper would back him if he backedRhodes.Rhodes, who was concerned about the delays, wrote to Beit: ‘He [Chamberlain]risks nothing. I risk everything and yet he will not budge an inch to help a bigidea which could make England dominant in Africa, in fact give England theAfrican continent.’ Chamberlain had in fact been pondering his options, and inNovember he called in Harris to announce his decision. Bechuanaland would remainin the hands of the Tswana people, but Rhodes could run a railway to Mafeking.For that purpose he would, ostensibly at least, be granted the strip of land soconveniently close to the Transvaal, thereafter known as the Pitsani Strip.Meanwhile in Johannesburg, the Uitlander Reform Committee decided that theircoup would take place on 28 December, a day after the Christmas horse races.Jameson would set out two days before this date. So he travelled to Cape Townfor a final briefing with Rhodes and Robinson. He also lunched with Frank Rhodesand the deeply sceptical Johannesburg Star editor Hamilton, who was notimpressed by Jameson’s professed expertise with Maxims: ‘I shall get through aseasily as knife cuts butter. You people do not know what the Maxim gun means. Ihave seen it at work.’ Jameson’s arrogance and complacency were everywhereevident. He seemed unconcerned that complex plans for provisioning andreinforcements collapsed when men and materials failed to arrive fromJohannesburg. There were other problems too: the last-minute row as to whichflag the rebels would carry – the Transvaal flag or the Union Jack.On 22 December at Groote Schuur, a reporter from The Times, Colonel FrancisYounghusband, informed Rhodes of Jameson’s disastrous state of unreadiness. TheStar editor Hamilton had travelled to Cape Town to tell Rhodes on behalf of theReform Committee that the uprising should be postponed until after Christmas.Their deputation said it might take six months to get the uprising properlyorganised. However, these warnings contradicted urgings from the top brass atThe Times – editor Moberly Bell and Flora Shaw – to continue with the plan.Meanwhile, the plotters continued to communicate in their code, a puerile ploythat no doubt brought smiles to the listening Boers. The revolt was referred toas the ‘polo tournament’. The Reform Committee in Johannesburg insisted oncalling it ‘the flotation’, however, and urged a postponement until 6 January.A farcical series of telegrams passed between Rhodes and the Reform Committee inJohannesburg, starting with one from Frank Rhodes: ‘Tell Dr. Jameson the polotournament is cancelled for one week as it would clash with Race Week.’ Jamesonwas so annoyed at this that, ignoring the schoolboy code, he wired back: ‘Inyour estimation do you consider races is of the utmost compared to the immenserisks of discovery daily expected.’ He warned darkly: ‘By which under thecircumstances it will be necessary to act prematurely.’Sunday 29 December, the day after the scheduled uprising, saw two telegrams comein: one from Rhodes – ‘In view of changed conditions, Jameson has been advisedaccordingly’ – another from Jameson – ‘I shall start without fail tomorrownight.’ Beset by conflicting advice, Rhodes wavered. He realised that if theraid did not take place immediately, it might never happen. On the other hand,Jameson’s retreat from Pitsani would be noted by the Boers – and his owninvolvement would be revealed. ‘I am closely watched,’ he told the ReformCommittee deputation led by Hamilton. ‘If it were known that you had comestraight off the train to me, tongues would get busy.’ Hamilton called PercyFitzPatrick, co-conspirator and Secret Society member, and told him that theraid was off and a fresh date would now be necessary. Rhodes also told hisneighbour and parliamentary colleague, Graham Bower, that the uprising had‘fizzled out’.There was panic as people jumped on horses and trains trying to get to Jameson,who was a good seventeen hours away. It was all to no avail, however, and tothis day it is unclear whether Rhodes genuinely wanted to stop Jameson.Significantly, a last telegram from Rhodes was never sent: in it, he instructedJameson to stop. Some have suggested it was forged, for it absolves Rhodes ofcharges of complicity. In the event, Rhodes threw a big luncheon party at GrooteSchuur that day and seemed serene. Perhaps he was trusting in fate – and therewas nothing and no one he trusted more than Jameson.The following day Rhodes went on the attack, instructing Hamilton to support theraid and sending a long defensive letter to The Times. Flora Shaw, who, onceagain, was probably operating under the direction of Stead or Brett, telegraphedChamberlain. She quoted Rhodes: ‘Today the crux is, I will win and South Africawill belong to England.’ Later in the week, Rhodes himself asked Chamberlain toencourage Robinson to go to Johannesburg as the British standard-bearer for theuprising. This followed a political storm in Parliament when Jan Hofmeyrabandoned all alliances with Rhodes and insisted that the governor denounce theraid. When it came to nothing, Rhodes determined to martyr himself inJohannesburg, contemptuously ignoring Rutherfoord Harris’s warning about theBoers. ‘Hang me!’ Rhodes screamed. ‘They can’t hang me. I’m a Privy Councillor.There are only 200 of us in the British Empire.’Alfred Beit’s complicity in the raid was confirmed in a coded telegram. It wassent to Cape Town after Rhodes had insisted that Robinson should travel openlyto Johannesburg the moment the uprising started. ‘Chairman starts immediatelyflotation takes place.’ Beit’s reply clearly reveals that he knew the code. InLondon, Brett – who held no official position at the time – went to see thecolonial secretary, Chamberlain. Soon thereafter the prime minister, LordRosebery, brusquely dismissed Jameson’s murderous advance on the Transvaal asnothing more than an ‘Elizabethan adventure’.Rhodes’s new group of contacts, who included Secret Society members as well asinvestors, started to flex their muscles. Among his influential friends, Rhodesalready listed Nathan Rothschild, Lord Halifax, Earl Grey, Lord Somerset, ArthurBaldwin and Regy Brett, who had the ear not only of the Queen but of many otherswho formed part of her imperial entourage. And circling the Society of the Electthere was the expanding Society of Friends. Stead, at the peak of his career andwielding massive power, herded them all like sheep. The intimacy of thisjournalist’s relations with the prime minister – allowing him to drop in anddiscuss Rosebery’s mental health with his doctor – is extraordinary. Stead’ssphere of influence may also have extended to the circle whose members – LoulouHarcourt and Brett in particular – were indulging in highly questionableactivities. A close confidant of Brett and Rosebery, Stead would surely havebeen aware that the young Archie Primrose – Rosebery himself – was among thosewho had fallen into Tute Cory’s Eton ‘Trap’.These links are confirmed by Brett’s biographer, James Lees-Milne, who expandsthe list by naming others, among them Lord Curzon, who were enmeshed in the EtonTrap. However, Lees-Milne goes on to deny the existence of the Secret Society,suggesting it never developed any further than the early meetings between Brett,Stead and Rhodes. Notwithstanding his scepticism, Lees-Milne records their plansfor a society that would ‘resemble the Society of Jesus but without attributes;the Elect would bind themselves to work for the Empire just as the Jesuitsworked for the Church of Rome’. He also mentions Stead’s proposal that the groupshould comprise four members: Stead himself, Milner, Brett, and Rhodes asgeneral. While these observations point to nothing less than the society Rhodeshad discussed with Gordon, Lees-Milne concludes: ‘In the end the Rhodes secretsociety came to nothing. Rhodes’s [later] wills omitted Stead.’This seems strangely disingenuous. In Brett’s own Journals he records plans formeetings with Chamberlain so as to work out a plan to save Rhodes – and indeedChamberlain – from the worst repercussions of the Jameson Raid. Indeed, Brettrefers to ‘our Society’ in 1896 when Rhodes comes to see him about this meetingwith Chamberlain. Lees-Milne must also have been aware that in 1900, a yearafter Rhodes’s seventh and last will, in his row with Stead about his loyaltyand the Boer War, Rhodes made an indisputable reference to the Society: ‘How canour Society be worked if each one sets himself up as the sole judge of whatshould be done?’ Appealing to Stead, he continued, ‘Just look at the positionhere. We three are in South Africa, all of us your boys … I myself, Milner andGarret, all of whom learned their politics from you.’In later years there were many press exposés of Brett’s clandestine activities,so Lees-Milne’s views can only be the consequence of Brett’s extreme reticence.The most secretive of all the Society’s agents, Brett had no option but to stayin the shadows if he was to keep his vital royal contacts. Throughout his longand extraordinary career as a lobbyist, Brett turned down some of the mostprestigious jobs in the land, including foreign secretary and viceroy of India.This is probably because he was devoted to the Secret Society and because anyhigh-profile job would have meant giving up his life of subterfuge. Happy tooccupy mediocre positions in England, he fought hard to keep the ear of theageing Queen and the two kings who succeeded her. Any suggestion that he was amember of a secret society in the employ of Cecil Rhodes would have shut thesedoors instantly. What is clear is that, for all his long years of secretactivity, serving three monarchs and as many prime ministers, Brett departed notone iota from the imperial dreams of Rhodes – and Milner, in particular – whichwere, of course, the raison d’être of the Secret Society as outlined in theConfession of Faith.* * *None of this was enough to save Rhodes from the fiasco of the Jameson Raid,although in the annals of disaster management what came next is surely in aclass of its own. The Boers waited until Jameson’s column marched into a valleybeneath the hills near Krugersdorp. Resplendent in his spotless uniform, SirJohn Willoughby shelled the Boer positions and then ordered a direct frontalattack. Thirty men fell immediately, cut down by lethal rifle fire from an enemythey could not see. Thirty more were captured, and the rest retreated. Theremnants of Jameson’s force were surrounded at a hill called Doornkop, wherethey surrendered after a brief and bloody encounter. The Boers took the woundedto hospital, while Jameson, Frank Rhodes and the other survivors weretransported to prison in Pretoria."},{"pageContent":"16Spies in SkirtsCecil Rhodes’s entire future depended on whether the British colonial secretary,Joseph Chamberlain, would be proved complicit in the Jameson Raid – and whetherRhodes could somehow trade information to save Rhodesia from the wreckage leftby the raid. The odds in the Game were heavily stacked against Rhodes. Hisbrother, Frank, and Jameson were both being held under threat of death in aPretoria jail, and their only hope was payment of ransom money as well as apromise from the British that they would stand trial in England. These termswere quickly agreed to.Rhodes knew he was too exposed to avoid being implicated, and that as a privycouncillor he would probably face a parliamentary trial – as indeed happened.That Chamberlain himself was complicit in the raid is no longer a matter ofdispute, but was not quite so cut and dried at the time.Chamberlain and Rhodes did at least have the British press on their side. TheTimes correspondent Flora Shaw had been enraptured by Rhodes, and both she andher newspaper remained loyal to him. ‘I have met now most of the English publicmen of my day,’ she wrote to her future husband, Frederick Lugard, in November1895, ‘but the impression conveyed to me by Mr. Rhodes is one of unselfishnessof aim greater and more complete than I have ever recognized before.’That year, on 10 December – three weeks before the raid – Shaw herself hadcabled Rhodes: ‘Can you advise when you will commence the plan, we wish to sendat earliest opportunity sealed instructions to representatives of the LondonTimes European capitals: it is most important using their influence in yourfavour.’ However, on 29 December, a few days before Jameson threw caution to thewinds and headed for Johannesburg, Chamberlain had panicked and cabled SirHercules Robinson:There seems to be fiasco in Johannesburg … Jameson might endeavour to forcematters … I could not remain passive were this to be done … remind Rhodes ifnecessary but not otherwise, of Articles 22 and 8 of the Charter and intimate tohim that in your opinion, he would not have my support and point out theconsequences which would follow to his schemes were I to repudiate the action.Chamberlain was issuing a clear threat to Rhodes: he would revoke the charter.Rhodes replied angrily: ‘Inform Chamberlain I shall get through all right if hesupports me, but he must not send cable like he sent the High Commissioner inSouth Africa. Today the crux is, I will win and South Africa will belong toEngland.’By then the ‘fiasco’ was already a reality, however, and Jameson was beyondRhodes’s control. Olive Schreiner claims to have asked Rhodes, ‘Why do you notstop [Jameson]. Although he has ridden in you could still stop him.’ Rhodesallegedly responded: ‘Poor old Jameson. Twenty years we have been friends andnow he goes in and ruins me. I cannot hinder him. I cannot go in and destroyhim.’On hearing news of the raid, an indignant Germany warned that it would notaccept any change of the status quo in the Transvaal, as proposed by CecilRhodes. This was followed by the rather blunt telegram from Kaiser Wilhelm toKruger, which so annoyed Queen Victoria: ‘I express my sincere congratulationsthat without calling on the aid of friendly Powers you and your people, by yourown energy against the armed bands which have broken into your country asdisturbers of the peace, have succeeded in re-establishing peace, and defendingthe independence of the country against attacks from without.’The cable caused an uproar in England and a nationalistic backlash. QueenVictoria cabled her grandson, Wilhelm: ‘I cannot refrain from expressing my deepregret at the telegram you sent President Kruger. It is considered veryunfriendly towards this country, which I feel it is not intended to be, and has,I grieve to say, made a most unfortunate impression.’ When the public called forwar, the Kaiser hurriedly backed down, though one suspects his tongue was in hischeek when he wrote: ‘Most beloved Granmamma, never was the telegram intended asa step against England or your Government … I never suspected that there werereal Englishmen or officers among them.’The Kaiser regarded the whole affair as a triumph for Germany. He had stoppedRhodes in his tracks, and German expansion could now proceed – possibly eveninto Rhodesia if the British revoked Rhodes’s charter. De Beers was accused ofgunrunning, the offices of Rhodes’s Gold Fields company had been theheadquarters of the conspirators, and Rhodes himself might well be arrestedunder the Foreign Enlistment Act, which made it an offence to launch anoffensive against a friendly state from British soil.The situation was further complicated by a change in government: Rosebery hadgiven way to Lord Salisbury, who decided he did not want to go to war for aninternational crime where a British privy councillor might be judged the guiltyparty. But the British public continued to stick by Rhodes, to the extent thatin England Jameson had become a folk hero, with a poem written in his honour bythe poet laureate, Alfred Austin. It was titled ‘Jameson’s Ride’:When men of our own blood pray usTo ride to their kinsfolk’s aid,Not Heaven itself shall stay usFrom the rescue they call a raid.There are girls in the gold-reef cityThere are mothers and children tooAnd they cry: ‘Hurry up! For pity!’So what can a brave man do.Not to be outdone, that more talented Victorian wordsmith, Rudyard Kipling,wrote a poem called ‘If’. The poem is essentially a paean for Jameson. The finalstanza was perhaps addressed to his friend Rhodes, and it has become a classicof English literature:1 [part0037.html#ch16fn-1]If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,Or walk with Kings – nor lose the common touch,If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,If all men count with you, but none too much;If you can fill the unforgiving minuteWith sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,And – which is more – you’ll be a Man, my son.For all the chauvinism, there was no saving Rhodes. Joseph Chamberlain haddecided to deny his own involvement in the raid.Rhodes took the advice Kipling offered elsewhere in the poem: he would ‘holdon’, and he would not ‘lie’. He sailed for England to face his accusers, thoughwith the incriminating Chamberlain telegrams tucked inside his briefcase. So awell-armed Rhodes arrived with his lawyer, Bouchier Hawksley, carrying a dossiercontaining a total of fifty-nine incriminating telegrams. Hawksley himself wascertainly a member of the Secret Society, having drawn up several of Rhodes’swills and been privy to their codicils.A meeting of the Secret Society was convened in London, following which Brettset up a meeting with an official of the Foreign Office. Chamberlain’srepresentative requested to see the telegrams, but Hawksley refused, saying,‘Mr. C. knows what I know, and I can shape his course with this knowledge.’ On 6February 1896, Brett arranged for Rhodes to meet Chamberlain himself. After along discussion, Rhodes left with an assurance that the charter – Rhodes’s writto run Rhodesia – was safe. The two parties had effectively blackmailed eachother: Rhodes would keep the Chamberlain telegrams secret if Chamberlain wouldnot revoke the charter.Chamberlain confirmed he would be obliged to set up a Parliamentary SelectCommittee to try Rhodes, but he also appointed himself chairman of the committeeto prevent any embarrassing questions being asked of either of them. The matterhad been squared. There was one problem, however: just as the raid had destroyedJan Hofmeyr’s confidence, so too it had shaken the confidence of W.T. Stead.From then on, Stead decided to keep a close eye on Rhodes, and so he contacted aspecial agent whose services he had used before. The agent operated incognitoand under diplomatic cover. Her name was Princess Catherine Radziwill, a wealthymember of the roving European royal community. She was what might be called a‘spy in a skirt’, and she had an uncanny ability to sniff out the type ofsalacious political story that Stead published in the Pall Mall Gazette.The Princess’s finances had collapsed after the death of Tsar Nicholas II andshe had a large family to support. Because Stead’s other female agent, OliveSchreiner, had become disillusioned with Rhodes, Stead decided the PrincessRadziwill might be more successful as a secret interlocutor. Exchanges betweenStead and the Princess indicate that he hoped to use her to negotiate with –rather than, as Milner believed, to blackmail – Rhodes after his relationshipwith Rhodes had begun to deteriorate. Whatever the case, the Princess Radziwillwas to prove a very competent agent who pursued her own agenda at least asassiduously as she worked to satisfy Stead’s requirements. Stead armed thePrincess with deadly ammunition: the contents of the Chamberlain telegrams. Bythis time, it should be recalled, Rhodes and Stead were still at loggerheadsover the raid, though Rhodes had fulfilled his part of the deal with Chamberlainby suppressing the incriminating telegrams. No one wanted this can of worms tobe reopened.Alfred Milner, intellectual giant of Balliol and All Souls,2[part0037.html#ch16fn-2] makes his first shadowy appearance as a member of theLondon-based Secret Society at about this time. A one-time journalist withStead, and having had a spell of diplomatic service in Egypt with Chinese Gordonand Kitchener, Milner was by now an up-and-coming civil servant and chairman ofthe Board of Inland Revenue. Among the first to be selected by Stead and Brettfor membership of the Society, it was not long before he was part of itsclandestine inner circle, the Society of the Elect. Later on, it was Brett wholobbied to have Milner appointed high commissioner for South Africa.Following the fiasco of the Jameson Raid, the crucial question is the extent ofcomplicity of the former prime minister, now the influential leader of theLiberal Party, Lord Rosebery – he who had dismissed the raid as an ‘Elizabethanadventure’. Dropping this pebble into these murky waters results inever-widening rings of complicity. If Chamberlain knew about the raid, then so,almost certainly, did Rosebery – and likewise close political contacts such asLoulou Harcourt, Lord Albert Grey, Arthur Balfour, Lord Halifax and AlfredLyttelton. Had the complicity of the Liberal Party leader been proven, hispolitical demise would have been as certain as that of Rhodes. But it was in theinterests of the Secret Society that Rosebery be protected. The government ofthe ageing Lord Salisbury was on its way out, and Rosebery might well bereturned to power.Rhodes had obviously debated the matter with the Secret Society. He had all theammunition he needed to take Chamberlain down, but the collapse of Chamberlaincould have a domino effect, starting with Rosebery and followed by most of theSociety’s influential friends. Rhodes agreed with the Elect of the SecretSociety that his best course was to resign as prime minister of the Cape andalso as chairman of the Charter Company, to protect Chamberlain and to vanishinto Rhodesia. At the very least, this would protect the Rhodesia charter.Stead, who was at the helm of the Society as well as Rhodes’s estate, meanwhilemade secret arrangements with Catherine Radziwill. There was far more to thePrincess than merely being a fortune-hunter, as history has portrayed her.Brett feared, however, that if Rhodes were to retire to Rhodesia – effectivelywithdrawing from public life – the Secret Society would lose its general. Steaddid not like it, but authority began to shift in Milner’s direction. Thesedevelopments occurred over many months, indeed amounted to contingency ratherthan forward planning, in the ripples from the raid. Brett’s Journals, asindicated previously, are remarkable documents not least because they werecollected and compiled into two massive volumes by the son he adored soobsessively, Maurice. In Volume One of two rare first editions I was fortunateto acquire, I discovered entries by Regy Brett which record conversations withRhodes and Chamberlain. These exchanges alter the course not only of imperialhistory but also, quite possibly, world history. Significantly, Brett kept hisjournals under lock and key, safely stowed inside a sturdy cupboard, where theyremained until his death. There is evidence that in 1896, more than two decadesafter its formation, the Secret Society is not only attested to, but all itsmain players are named – by Brett himself. They were flushed out by the JamesonRaid.The first entry refers to a letter from the ‘Hon J. Chamberlain, Highbury,Birmingham’ to ‘My Dear Brett’. In this letter, Chamberlain acknowledges thatBrett is acting on behalf of Rhodes and that Brett had sent word regardingRhodes’s stance on the matter. Dismissing Rhodes’s position, Chamberlaindeclares: ‘It will never be tolerated that pro-consuls in all the ends of theearth shall be allowed to have war-making power of their own and to conduct boththat and their diplomacy without consideration for headquarters.’ Chamberlainthen suggests a defence to Brett – effectively proposing that Rhodes should lie:If Rhodes were able to say (and to stand examination upon it) that he was, likeeveryone, aware of the possibility of revolution in Johannesburg, and that hethought it his duty to be prepared, and even to have a force in observation, buthe had no intention that this force should be used except upon an emergency andon the consent of the High Commissioner, I think it would be difficult to findserious fault with him.As I understand it, what Rhodes’ enemies allege is that, with a view to improvethe pecuniary position of the Chartered Company, whose property in Matabelelandand Mashonaland has turned out to be a failure, he desired ‘to rush’ theTransvaal. With this object he fostered the revolutionary movement and assistedit with arms and money. Of course I do not adopt this charge but it issubstantially what Rhodes will have to answer. I might add that, although theexistence of a German-Dutch conspiracy would hardly justify the action imputedto Rhodes yet conclusive proof of it would undoubtedly tend to divert the issueand share the blame.I have marked this letter private but you may show it if you like to anybodyinterested in the question.In other words, ‘show it’ to Rhodes. The very next entry in the Journals of 1896is a memorandum which reveals that Brett hurriedly consulted with senior membersof the Secret Society. ‘I asked Natty Rothschild to let him [Rhodes] knowimmediately he arrived at Plymouth that he should make no statement until he hadseen him. Then I told Natty the substance of Chamberlain’s letter.’ Rothschildmet Rhodes off the boat and told him exactly what Chamberlain had said. Andthen, Brett records the following: ‘Rhodes denies all knowledge of the JamesonRaid. He urges very strongly that Chamberlain should obtain the release of thefive prisoners at present in Pretoria [by now they included Frank Rhodes andJameson, both under sentence of death], and redress for the grievances of theUitlanders.’This defiance generated widespread alarm, and Stead was duly summoned. ‘In theafternoon Stead came to see me,’ Brett records. Stead had apparently just had along talk with Rhodes but Rhodes’s own account was a different, rather garbledone. Rhodes said he would admit complicity in the raid, even though he was notresponsible for it and had no idea it would take place, and that in fact it wasnever intended to occur. The idea was that the uprising should take place inJohannesburg and that the Chartered Force led by Jameson would restore order.Brett relayed the rest of Rhodes’s statement to Stead:On the other hand he had fostered and encouraged rebellion in Johannesburg.There might be documentary evidence of this. He had taken no trouble to coverhis trail. He had subscribed money and sent telegrams, if he had not sentletters. There might be heaps of evidence. It was of no use to deny all this,and beside he never told lies.Brett’s Journals further reveal that on 5 February he again met with Rhodes. Thelatter confirmed what he had said to Stead, saying that he planned to tellChamberlain ‘the whole truth’. Aware of course of what Chamberlain wished him tosay, Rhodes claimed that he ‘thought it better on the whole to be perfectlyfrank. That it was the worst possible policy to lie.’ Moreover, ‘his brother,Frank, was in charge in Johannesburg … if he were to tell [Chamberlain] that hehad known nothing of the events leading up to the rebellion, I should think himnot only a liar but a fool’.It is hard to know whether, by this stage, Rhodes himself could distinguishbetween truth and falsehood. Brett’s records reveal a mixture of lies, righteousself-justification, self-delusion and dubious buck-passing to Frank. However,Brett’s response to Rhodes brings the Colossus down to earth: ‘I pointed outthat there was one consideration which appeared to have escaped him, that wasthe position of Mr. Chamberlain. Chamberlain was obviously anxious to help.’ Thequestion is, if Chamberlain was innocent, why was he so anxious to help? Surelyhe would not have wanted any further involvement in the affair?An intriguing journal entry follows, recording a wistful statement from Rhodes:‘On leaving, he said. “Wish we could get our secret society”’ (emphasis mine).Obviously written in a hurry, this fragment of conversation is open to wideinterpretation. The most likely meanings are that Rhodes was asking Brett to geta decision on the matter from the Secret Society, or to get the members togetherto help with decisions he had to make – which in fact is what happened.Maurice Brett, who published his father’s journals, certainly believed thatthere was a Secret Society in 1896. Seeking to explain the meaning of Rhodes’smysterious ‘wish’, Maurice inserts the following: ‘See Sarah Millin, pp. 32[part0009.html#page32], 128 [part0016.html#page128], 172[part0020.html#page172], 216 [part0023.html#page216].’ All these italicised pagenumbers in Millin’s Rhodes relate to various aims of the Secret Society.Maurice’s note is significant because at the time he published his father’sjournals the Secret Society was still regarded as something of a myth, aninfantile fantasy of Rhodes.Soon after Brett’s February meeting with Rhodes, he and Stead began conferringnot only with Chamberlain but also with Rosebery, with whom Stead was onintimate terms, and who was likely to be the next Liberal prime minister. In awell-known letter from the time, Eton tutor William Johnson Cory tells Brettthat Rosebery is ‘the wisest and wittiest boy that ever lived’. Cory elaborateson this in a letter to Francis Warre-Cornish, vice-provost of Eton, describingyoung Rosebery as ‘one of those who like the palm without the dust’. Bretthimself wrote to Rosebery, recalling one of his earliest memories: ‘the stresslaid upon’ Rosebery’s name by Cory, who had exercised ‘the greatest influence’over Brett’s own youth. He tells Rosebery: ‘From that time you have always beenmore to me than anyone else in public life, representing something which everyother man lacked. For this reason, if no other, I desired to be beholden to you,and to feel this tie in addition to those of private friendship.’It is no surprise, therefore, that the obsequious Brett landed the job ofsecretary to the Office of Works, though Rosebery was condemned for favouritismby his own chief whip, who described the appointment as ‘execrable’. Questionswere raised as to why Brett had taken the job, for he had turned down moreprestigious posts in the past – as indeed he would continue to do. But the‘Works’ for which Brett was responsible included the maintenance of publicbuildings, in particular Queen Victoria’s favourite palace, Windsor Castle.Within a few months of his appointment, Brett had the royal ‘ear’. He soonbecame England’s most influential courtier – a position he would hold for thenext forty years. Significantly, he remained a confidant of Alfred, soon to beLord Milner, and soon also to be high commissioner of the Cape of Good Hope, themost influential position in South Africa.* * *The aftermath of the Jameson Raid saw a beleaguered Rhodes in England, while inSouth Africa the situation was quite different: his Secret Society and themajority white population of the Transvaal remained fiercely loyal to him.Within weeks of the raid a new group calling itself the South African Leagueemerged, which quickly became known as the ‘Jingoists’. The league representedEnglish nationalism in its most extreme form. It was the product of Britishpublic reaction to the Boers and to Germany in the wake of the Kaiser’s gloatingletter to President Kruger. Its stated objective was similar to the coreobjective of the Rhodes Secret Society – the federation under English rule ofall the countries of south-central Africa – which was assiduously supported byStead’s newspapers and The Times.Few records exist of this league or of its leaders and backers. It was wellfunded, and branches quickly grew all over South Africa as it receivedenthusiastic support from the embittered Uitlanders of the Transvaal. The leagueoperated exactly like an Association of Helpers – the broader outer circle ofthe Society of the Elect that, under Milner, was to be the next stage in themetamorphosis of the Secret Society. Milner himself was appointed highcommissioner in South Africa just a few months after the Jameson Raid – asomewhat surprising move that was orchestrated by the Secret Society. Stead, inhis book on Rhodes’s wills, claims credit for Milner’s nomination. Brett –another member of the cadre – accompanied Milner to Windsor upon his appointmentby Rosebery. Rhodes clearly had a hand in this too, as is confirmed by LittleJohnston (now Sir Harry), who had himself had his eye on the position of highcommissioner: ‘At last the decision was made – Sir Alfred Milner. I suspect verymuch on the personal pleadings of Cecil Rhodes.’Milner’s influence in the Secret Society was evident from the beginning. Somemonths earlier, Stead had told Milner that Rhodes had confessed his complicityin both the raid and the Uitlander uprising. Milner then reported this to Brett,and warned him that the plans of the Secret Society might have to be placed onhold: ‘We may have to give up for years the hope of bringing the Transvaaleffectively within the South African “dominion.”’ Milner mentioned a dangerouspossibility: ‘What if the Boers place themselves under German protection?’Brett then decided on an extraordinary step3 [part0037.html#ch16fn-3] which heis unlikely to have taken without the sanction of the other members of theSociety. He told Chamberlain of the existence of the Secret Society and evendisclosed his own involvement in it. With Jameson in jail and the threat ofimprisonment hanging over Rhodes, this seems an exceptionally dangerous move.However, perhaps that was precisely Brett’s purpose – a veiled warning toChamberlain to leave Rhodes alone because he had such powerful friends. Theforeign secretary’s reaction supports the latter interpretation, as Brett’sbiographer claims: Chamberlain heard Brett out, and then told him he wanted tohear nothing more about the Society. Chamberlain ‘was not particularlyinterested, indeed rebuked Brett for mentioning it’. The only rationale for sucha reaction is that, were he to be asked in a court of law or Parliament,Chamberlain could convincingly deny any knowledge of the Secret Society.By now it is clear that Chamberlain had – however unwittingly – abetted theSociety in the planning and organisation of the raid. At the very least, he wascognisant of the intentions of the Society. The telegrams that Rhodes broughtwith him to London confirm this over and over again. Moreover, Chamberlain hadappointed Milner – who, he would surely have known, was close to Brett and Stead– to effectively resume the work Rhodes had been obliged to give up after theraid. Some have suggested that Chamberlain was in fact a member of the Society:it had been Chamberlain after all who, on the recommendation of Rhodes, Steadand Brett, had fired Robinson and conveniently appointed Milner in his place.Chamberlain’s reluctance to deny any knowledge, if put under oath, of thecomplicity of the Secret Society – as opposed to that of Rhodes – in the JamesonRaid is understandable. For though Chamberlain was undoubtedly a ‘friend’ ofRhodes’s Society, he was also fathering a political dynasty of his own, namelyAusten and Neville Chamberlain. He would in any case have hedged his commitmentto the Society, given the fact that Rhodes was in such deep trouble. So, at thatstage, Milner was definitely the better bet.* * *Rhodes’s ship had docked at Southampton with its explosive cargo – BouchierHawksley and the incriminating cables – and in his Journals Brett records havingyet another meeting with Chamberlain. Though no mention was made of the SecretSociety, Chamberlain warned Brett to get Rhodes to a good lawyer, and to do soquickly. Together with Brett, Rhodes went to see Sir George Lewis, who advisedhim to hold his tongue and get out of the country. This was not what Rhodeswanted to hear. He loudly declared that he had expected the British governmentto come to the aid of the Uitlanders – that is, to support another uprising. ButBrett put an end to the bombast, telling Rhodes that an estimated 20,000 Britishtroops would be needed to put down the now triumphant and well-armed Boers.Rhodes took Sir George’s advice and left the country on the first availablesteamship.Jameson was brought to England and charged under the Foreign Enlistment Act withmounting a military attack on a friendly state. He was sentenced to fifteenmonths’ imprisonment, though he served only four months of the sentence. Havingpleaded ill health, he returned to the Cape, where in time he became primeminister. He had taken Rhodes’s place.Of those in jail in Pretoria, four, including Frank Rhodes, were sentenced todeath for treason. However, these sentences were commuted to large fines, whichBeit and Rhodes paid the next day. By the time the dust had settled, the twomagnates are thought to have spent close on a million pounds for variousexpenses.The Parliamentary Select Committee set up to judge Rhodes’s part in the raideventually met in 1897, and Rhodes duly returned to England, attending hearingstwice a week for three weeks. When sessions went on through the lunch hour, hecould usually be found chewing on sandwiches and sipping stout. He admitted hispart in the raid, but only after lecturing the committee on the iniquitiesimposed by Kruger on the majority-Uitlander population. Any questions whichmight incriminate third parties he refused to answer. Under Chamberlain’s gaze,Rhodes refused as a ‘matter of honour’ to reveal the contents of the telegrams.His interrogators accepted all these evasions, and the hearing was recognisedfor what it was – a cover-up, with one headline aptly describing it as ‘TheLying in State at Westminster’. Rhodes biographer Brian Roberts wrote at thetime, ‘Thus it was that, at a public investigation held in the full glare ofworld-wide publicity, the only facts revealed were those which Cecil Rhodescondescended to supply.’But when Rhodes returned to the Cape, the crowds that gathered to greet him wereeven bigger than before. Standing on the dock before a huge audience, hedeclared that he had come back to ‘fight for equal political rights for everywhite man south of the Zambesi’ – a statement he later revised, scribbling on ascrap of paper:My motto isequal rights for every civilised man South of the ZambesiWhat is a civilised man?A man whether white or black who has sufficient education to write his name, whohas some property or worksin fact is not a loafer.C.J. Rhodes.4 [part0037.html#ch16fn-4]This hurriedly written scrap earned Rhodes the dubious soubriquet‘nigger-lover’, which stuck with him for the rest of his life. Nevertheless, aprocession numbering almost 5,000 working-class people marched out to GrooteSchuur to pledge their loyalty to him.Soon afterwards Rhodes took himself off to his vast fruit farm in Rhodesia,where he met up with a couple of angels – Gordon le Sueur and Johnny Grimmer.While there, he caught a fever which, Le Sueur noted, was brought on by hishabit of walking about ‘stark naked exposed to draughts’.5[part0037.html#ch16fn-5] So bad-tempered did Rhodes become that Le Sueur wentoff hunting in Mozambique without telling him. On his return Rhodes forgave him,and in 1899 he took Le Sueur to England where he bought him a lavish wardrobe.Grimmer, who had developed a serious alcohol problem, had fortunately been leftbehind on the farm.The real damage done by the Jameson Raid was, however, insidious andirreversible. Afrikaner nationalism and an empathy with Germany prevailed. Therewas also a deep hatred of Britain. This antipathy would be deepened by Milner’streatment of Boer women and children in concentration camps during theAnglo-Boer War, and it persisted up to the Second World War and beyond; to thisday, there are remnants of anti-British feeling in pockets of South Africa.At the time, Kruger exacerbated matters by arming his republic to the teeth witha vast array of weapons willingly supplied by Germany and France, comprisingfield and siege artillery, Maxim guns, howitzers, Mauser and Martini-Henryrifles. A third of the Transvaal’s revenue was spent on this weaponry between1896 and 1899. But Kruger never had the manpower to win a war against theBritish, and the expected help from Germany failed to materialise.In Rhodesia, the Matabele were quick to realise that Dr Jameson no longer posedany problem, and that virtually his entire police force had been locked up inthe Transvaal. They embarked on a vengeful mfecane and nearly 10 per cent of thesettler population was killed or wounded. Rhodesia turned into an armed camp,with the citizens of Bulawayo fighting each other to loot weapons from theCharter Company’s arsenal. At this point the usually more placid Shona joinedthe fray, proving that they could kill whites as effectively as the Matabele,adding 100 more casualties to the number of settler dead. Nobody bothered,apparently, to count the black dead.For Rhodes, these upheavals could not have come at a more convenient time. Heneeded to keep his head down while the dust of the raid settled, and a colonialwar provided the perfect smokescreen. Chamberlain, apparently at Rhodes’sbidding, sent colonial troops under imperial officers – among them RobertBaden-Powell – to put down the rebellion. Having no sooner appointed himselfcolonel, Rhodes vanished into the hinterland to lead the troops, promisingChamberlain that he would fund the entire campaign. What followed is awell-known tale: Rhodes fought bravely, he skilfully negotiated, peace wasdeclared, and he earned the respect of the Matabele chiefs – a claim someNdebele deny – and restored much of his reputation. On his return to the Cape,even larger crowds turned out to give him a hero’s welcome. Rhodes had clearlyregained his appetite for politics.Following the fiasco of the raid, Lord Grey was appointed administrator ofRhodesia in Jameson’s place. He promised Rhodes that he would complete hisimperial project in Matabeleland. Given his lifelong friendship with Brett andRhodes, it is probable that Grey was an early member of the Secret Society. Thisassumption is further validated in Grey’s revelation as to the true reasonbehind the Matabele campaign: ‘Until we catch them and thoroughly convince themthat this country is to be the country of the white, and not the black, man wemust go on hammering and hunting them.’6 [part0037.html#ch16fn-6]The Secret Society had held on, not without pain but with few victims, and itwas now ready to return to the fray: to federate South Africa and eventually thewhole world under an imperial government. Quigley observes: ‘Leaving aside allhypothesis, the facts are clear: Rhodes wanted to create a worldwide secretgroup devoted to English ideals and to the Empire as the embodiment of theseideals and such a group was created. It was created in the period after 1890 byRhodes, Stead and above all, by Milner.’ Brett had stayed in the shadows socleverly that not even Quigley had spotted him.Rhodes returned to his beloved Cape in 1897 to find that the newly appointedhigh commissioner had lost no time in making clear his approach to Kruger andthe victims of the failed raid – and he was clearly out to avenge the SecretSociety. Milner presided over a series of tense meetings, culminating in theBloemfontein Conference, where both sides proved ever more intransigent. Milnerand Rhodes had already decided that war with the Boers was inevitable, and thata British conquest of their little republics was the only way to get theSociety’s plan back on track: a federation that was the first stage in aneventual world federation.On his voyage back to South Africa on the steamship Scott, Rhodes was a regularguest at the captain’s table. The first night at dinner a well-dressed Europeanwoman approached the table and enquired whether any seats were free. Rhodesinvited her to join them. According to his secretary, ‘Flippie’ Jourdan, Rhodesdid not recognise the Princess Radziwill, despite the fact that they hadpreviously been guests at a dinner party in London. Colin Harding wrote anaccount of this encounter, claiming the meeting was far from accidental. ‘ThePrincess was so anxious to travel to Cape Town in the society of Rhodes that shehad cancelled a berth which she had taken on a steamer sailing the previousSaturday to travel now with the illustrious statesman.’This and other reports suggest that, while Catherine Radziwill’s motives mayhave been mixed, her primary target was Rhodes, whom she saw as a ‘catch’.However, her role as an agent for W.T. Stead in an era when the roles of femalejournalists, secret agents and mistresses were somewhat blurred, casts doubt onso obvious a conclusion. Catherine Radziwill would have had strong suspicionsabout Rhodes’s sexual inclinations. His boyfriend-secretary was a constantpresence at the captain’s table (young Philip Jourdan had previously fantasisedabout travelling with Rhodes), as was Sir Charles Metcalfe, another ‘intimate’of Rhodes.It is more than likely that the Great Game was played at that table, and thatCatherine Radziwill was dealing the cards – as we know, the Princess wasintensely interested in politics and political scandals. It is likely she was ona mission for Stead, who, since Milner’s appointment, would have begun to fearthat his grip on Rhodes as well as his fortune were slipping. One of the lettersof introduction the Princess carried to South Africa was from the British primeminister Lord Salisbury to the high commissioner Lord Milner. From Stead himselfshe carried ‘secret documents’ – her possession of which was a matter of alarmfor Milner. Oblivious of all this, Rhodes ignored his disgruntled neophytes andgraciously welcomed the Princess to the table."},{"pageContent":"17The Great GamePrincess Catherine Radziwill has been widely denigrated1[part0037.html#ch17fn-1] as a minor European royal with fading looks, littletalent and even less money who set off on a mission to seduce Cecil Rhodes.However, this is a risible picture of the Princess. She was in fact a legitimateRussian princess with royal relatives and her own estate. When she first metMilner in South Africa her credentials were from the British Tory primeminister, Lord Salisbury. She refused to rise when Milner, the representative ofthe Queen in South Africa, entered the room. Her own rank, she rightly claimed,was superior to that of any high commissioner. A Ruskin-styled socialist, Milnerloathed her from that moment.He did not realise he was dealing with a Trojan horse, however. Whenfifteen-year-old Catherine married Prince Adam Karl Wilhelm Radziwill, who wastwenty-six, she became the youngest princess in a family that traced its lineageto the former kings of Poland. She spent the first years of her marriageproducing five children at the Radziwill Palace in Berlin where she wassurrounded by stuffy relatives, Prussian aristocrats and Catholic churchmen.Closely chaperoned, she attended soirées twice a week where, often in thecompany of the Emperor and the Empress, everyone spoke French. Eventually,Catherine Radziwill was fluent in five European languages – but she was bored totears.For a vivacious, intelligent and enquiring young woman such a life wasuntenable, and the Princess was soon in trouble for coquetry and flirtationswith the younger princes and courtiers. The austere Empress Augusta called herto a special audience, rebuking her for her behaviour. As these tedious yearswent by, the Princess began to find interesting and lucrative ways of occupyingherself. In 1885 she secretly collaborated with the Countess Yuliana Glinka on aseries of articles published in Mme Juliette Adam’s racy magazine La NouvelleRevue. Catherine Radziwill later published anonymously these exposés of Berlinsociety as a very successful book, Berlin Society, and the two authoresses thenturned their eyes towards St Petersburg. Eventually, however, the Princess andher family were forced to move from Berlin. As things turned out, she wasluckier than her relatives, who were sent into exile and their estatesconfiscated by the Tsar.The European wars and revolutions of the next two decades had by the late 1880sreduced the Princess Radziwill to living by her wits. A writer who eventuallyhad many books to her name, she resorted to being a political informer. She wasalso an agent-cum-lobbyist in the political game that played out in the Balkansand on the borders of the Russian empire. Another individual who was playingthis political game was W.T. Stead, who employed a network of agents, many ofthem women. Stead describes Princess Radziwill’s situation thus: ‘She was thenvirtually under sentence of banishment from Berlin by decree of Prince Bismark.She had written a novel which made no small sensation at the time, owing to theside-lights which it threw upon the inside track of German politics … and wasrecognized both in St Petersburg and Berlin not only as a lady of great personalcharm, but a political person of no small influence.’The Princess likewise believed that Stead was playing politics as well asjournalism as she watched his manoeuvrings at a conference in St Petersburg –where, she noted, he made a pass at the beautiful Irish nationalist, Maud Gonne.Also present was the French lobbyist Juliette Adam; she and Radziwill wouldeventually be instrumental in setting up a Russian–French alliance. From thistime on, Catherine Radziwill was a secret contact of Stead’s, selling himinformation whose source remains mysterious. On one occasion, at a ball duringthe conference, she was partnered with Prince Alexander of Battenberg, a criticof the Russian government who had become an enemy of the Tsar. In an earlyautobiographical work she admitted she had passed on news of this spat to DonaldMackenzie Wallace, the Times correspondent in Constantinople.Catherine Radziwill was, in fact, anything but the fortune-hunting frump thatthe Rhodes camp described after their meeting with her on the Scott. Moreover,there is no actual proof that her change of ticket was anything butcoincidental. If indeed she had heard that Rhodes was sailing at about the sametime, it would have been sensible as a journalist to try to be on his ship. Thestory of her joining Rhodes at his table has been stretched to fit the theory ofgold-digger – but what could be more natural than a princess joining thecaptain’s table? The only objections would have come from Rhodes’s gay fellowtravellers, Charles Metcalfe and Flippie Jourdan. They are unlikely to havewelcomed a vivacious, attractive female who threatened to encroach on theirterritory. Indeed, Jourdan’s account speaks volumes:She tripped along lightly, only the rustling of her silk garments being audible.As she advanced she looked round the salon for a seat, but accidentally, Isuppose, made a bee-line for Mr. Rhodes’s table. She did not of course recognizehim until she was at the table. She appeared quite overcome with surprise whenshe did see him and exclaimed ‘Oh. How do you do.’ Mr Rhodes rose from his seatas did Sir Charles and I, and we all bowed to her. She nervously placed her handon the back of a chair at our table and said ‘Is this chair engaged? May I haveit?’ Mr. Rhodes gallantly replied ‘Certainly Princess, you are welcome to it’,and at the same time turned it for her at a convenient angle. Of course sheoccupied the chair for the rest of the voyage.Jourdan continues in this somewhat bitchy vein: ‘She was inclined to be stout,had black hair and black shifting eyes. She could not be called handsome orpretty and was about 47 years of age.’ This is nothing more than jealousy.Catherine Radziwill was forty-one years old, and photographs show her as fairlyslim with an elegant head of hair and sparkling, intelligent eyes. Jourdan lateradmits that she astonished everyone with her knowledge of politics, Englishliterature and her multilingualism. A worldly woman, she made even Rhodes blushwith her blunt observations of ‘delicate matters’, and once, while sitting nextto him on deck, she fainted, her head falling into his lap! ‘I shall neverforget,’ says Jourdan, ‘the absolute abject look of helplessness on his face.’And yet one cannot help asking: Why, if Rhodes so disliked the Princess, was helying right beside her sunning himself?Rhodes had clearly taken to the Princess, and after she landed and went to stayat the gracious Mount Nelson Hotel he not only paid her bills but invited her onnumerous occasions to social events at Groote Schuur. Dr Jameson, newlyreinstated in Cape Town and clearly with a vested interest in Rhodes, was thefirst to smell a rat – and a rat there indeed was – eventually banning thePrincess altogether from Groote Schuur. But there was a far more interestinggame afoot: a Great Game featuring Catherine Radziwill, orchestrated by Stead.This story needs to be carefully unravelled, since it has been muchmisrepresented by most of Rhodes’s biographers.The received history of the Radziwill–Rhodes affair – a good man, innocent ofwomen’s wiles, robbed by an ageing gold-digging female blackmailer – issimplistic. Reading between the lines of the official story, a much darkerversion emerges. While several questions remain unanswered, this alternativeversion posits the possibility of a very different history of Cecil Rhodes. ThePrincess first met Stead in Berlin in 1888. At that time, at least in Europe,she was a better-known journalist and author than he was. The terms ‘journalist’and ‘secret agent’ were almost synonymous in those volatile times, and thePrincess was at least as well connected politically as Stead, including with theIrish nationalist movement (via Maud Gonne), and with French activists (viaJuliette Adam).The Princess had contact with dissident liberal elements of the Europeanaristocracy in Russia – her dancing partner, Prince Battenberg, being one such –and in Germany through her own personal sympathies. She extended her net toLondon in 1893 when her daughter ‘came out’. They enjoyed a season of balls andparties where Princess Radziwill made many influential contacts; two inparticular are already part of this story: Lord Rothschild, a member of theSecret Society, and Lord Salisbury, the prime minister. She stayed at each oftheir homes, Hatfield House and Waddesdon Manor. From there, it was on toFlorence and Paris and then the hunting season in Scotland. The Princess wasclearly in a social bracket far superior to that of Rhodes, Stead, and even RegyBrett.In Rome, the Princess experienced something of an epiphany when she attended aprivate Mass said by the Pope: ‘That silent, haughty hieractic figure! Isuddenly understood what I had not been able to comprehend until then, the powerwielded by the Church of Rome, simply through its immobility, and its stagnationpaths into which the human mind had left long ago.’ As a consequence shedeclared: ‘I love England. After my own native Russia, it is the country I carefor most.’ She was more than a mere Anglophile, however, and was soon a fervidimperialist whose enthusiasm rivalled even that of Rhodes.She loved her homeland, maintained strong ties with the Tsar, and attended hisson’s marriage. Nicholas II’s bride was Princess Alix of Hesse – the ill-starredgranddaughter of Queen Victoria, mother of the haemophiliac Tsarevich Alexei,friend of Rasputin, and last empress of Russia. Princess Radziwill’s fall fromgrace was the consequence of her growing animosity towards Nicholas II, whom sheblamed for the suppression of liberal opinion in Russia. ‘Her contempt forNicholas II was surpassed only by her loathing for his German-born wife,’ writesBrian Roberts in Cecil Rhodes and the Princess. In a damning observation, henotes: ‘Catherine claimed that together Nicholas and Alexandra were the solecause of the downfall of the Romanov dynasty and the collapse of ImperialRussia. It was an opinion shared by many other Russians.’Before this, while her star was still on the rise, both her elder daughters hadmarried well,2 [part0037.html#ch17fn-2] making Catherine Radziwill a grandmotherat thirty-nine. She spent the next two years as an agent in Europe sellinginformation, mostly anonymously, to The Times, the Pall Mall Gazette and the newmagazine W.T. Stead had started with Rhodes’s money, the Review of Reviews. Shewas the subject of much gossip as a result of her bohemian life spent among‘socialist agitators, artists, circus riders, authors and journalists’. Her auntwas the wife of Émile Zola, having been his mistress for several years. She wasobviously living an exciting life, though one wonders about her association with‘circus riders’. Unfortunately, her income rarely equalled her expenditure. Thatis not to say that Catherine Radziwill was penniless, though, or even poor. Herfather’s death had left her with her own estate at Pjatino which yielded a smallbut regular income, and two of her daughters were now immensely wealthy women.The fact is that when she arrived in South Africa in 1899, she wore jewellerythat made other women gasp.No record exists of what called the Princess to England in 1896 when the countrywas in a ferment about the failed Jameson Raid, but the night of 4 Februaryfound her dining with her old friend Moberly Bell. He was manager of The Times,the newspaper which, through Flora Shaw, had acted as a conduit for Rhodes priorto and during the raid. Seated on Radziwill’s right was Cecil Rhodes –contradicting Flippie Jourdan’s hint that their meeting on board the Scott wasentirely coincidental. The seating arrangement at Bell’s table was surely noaccident. Catherine Radziwill was obviously being set up for a relationship withRhodes, whether professional or otherwise.The Secret Society has always been regarded as an all-male group, which is inthe tradition of such cabals. But it is highly likely that women like FloraShaw, Catherine Radziwill and Violet Gascoyne-Cecil (who had a late marriage toMilner), had a special relationship with the Secret Society and were almostcertainly members of its fringe group, the Society of Friends. The Princess wasby this time a passionate imperialist and would a few years hence destituteherself by publishing in South Africa a jingoistic newspaper called GreaterBritain which was entirely supportive of Rhodes’s ideals, and which she startedwith the help of W.T Stead.Catherine Radziwill was apparently at her scintillating best at that dinner inLondon with Rhodes. However, he had many other things on his mind and no greatimpression was made on either side. The Princess went back to her ‘journalism’,developing an ever-closer relationship with W.T. Stead. Incidentally, the dinnertook place in 1896, the same year that Stead had his first serious disagreementwith Rhodes. It may even have been the moment that started the rot whicheventually caused Rhodes to cut Stead from his will in favour of Milner. And itmay have triggered Stead’s sense that someone was needed who could keep an eyeon Rhodes. The Princess would do very well for the job.Stead conceived the idea of preparing the public for the revelations which werebound to come out about Rhodes and the Jameson Raid. With this in mind, hesuggested a semi-fictional booklet titled The History of the Mystery which wouldreveal, by means of a series of telegrams, Chamberlain’s complicity in the raid.It was a good title but a bad idea, for Rhodes had already devised other plansfor the telegrams.Stead had learnt of the secret Chamberlain telegrams from Rhodes’s lawyer,Bouchier Hawksley. While The History of the Mystery was allegedlysemi-fictitious, it was alarmingly accurate about the content of the telegrams.It is unlikely that Hawksley would have revealed this material to Stead withoutconsulting Milner, Rhodes and Brett. There is the equally unlikely scenario ofStead going ahead with his booklet without consulting Rhodes or the othermembers of the Society of the Elect. The only logical scenario is that theSecret Society was aware of Stead’s booklet and initially approved it. Theproblem was Rhodes’s vacillation: he kept changing his mind about what he shouldadmit to, particularly after Brett’s meeting with Chamberlain and theirconsultations with a lawyer. So Rhodes ordered Stead to censor the publication –but by then it was streaming off the presses.After Rhodes’s intervention Stead changed his mind and agreed to do what hecould to limit distribution – a highly unusual response for him. Stead had neverstopped publication of anything before, so this is symptomatic of how vulnerablehe had begun to feel, particularly as Milner’s star rose in the Society. Steadneeded a helpmate who could influence Rhodes and also breach the protective wallof male acolytes who never left his side.So when Catherine Radziwill – either by accident or design – sailed for CapeTown on the same ship as Rhodes in 1899, she was far more than a woman in searchof a rich husband. Together with Stead, she intended not simply to report on theEmpire, but to advance its interests. That is not to say she had no romanticintentions. Stead was eager for Rhodes to have a wife even if it were a meremarriage of convenience as enjoyed by his friends, Regy Brett and ArchiePrimrose.Stead had no compunction in using women to help him play the Great Game. Andnow, according to Quigley, Stead had chosen Catherine Radziwill to take overfrom the discredited Miss Shaw, who had played the dual role of friend and spyto Rhodes. Flora Shaw had turned out to be more of a political animal than ajournalist, as Quigley suggests:Miss Shaw, when she came to The Times, was an open champion of Lord Salisburyand an active supporter of a vigorous imperial policy especially in SouthAfrica. She was in the confidence of the Colonial Office and of Rhodes to adegree that cannot be exaggerated. She met Rhodes on Stead’s recommendation, in1889, at a time when Stead was one of Rhodes’s closest confidants. In 1892, MissShaw was sent to South Africa by Moberly Bell, with instructions to set up twolines of communications from that area to himself. One of these was to be knownto The Times and would handle routine matters; the second was to be known onlyto herself and was to bring confidential material to her private address. Theexpenses of both of these avenues would be paid for by The Times, but theexpenses of the secret avenue would not appear on the records of Printing HouseSq.It should not be forgotten that Milner had initially been Stead’s man, havingbeen in his employ at the Pall Mall Gazette. Stead had also been instrumental insecuring Milner’s job in South Africa. But within months of Milner taking up theposition, Stead suspected him of forming a new and separate relationship withRhodes. As a result, Stead not only paid the Princess in kind, commissioningarticles, he also armed her with a number of allegedly secret documents, theexact nature of which has, however, never been revealed. She received otherforms of assistance too, with Brett funding the salary of an assistant sent outfrom England when Radziwill started her pro-Rhodes newspaper.The moment Milner took up his position in South Africa, there is evidence of aslow worsening of relations between Stead and other members of the Society ofthe Elect. It never broke down entirely while Rhodes was still alive, but fromthe time of the Jameson Raid the Society split into two camps, with Rhodes andMilner in one, and Stead and Catherine Radziwill in the other. Regy Brett, aswas his wont, remained all things to all people, linking the court, thegovernment, and the Secret Society with its expanding circle of Helpers in aclandestine though powerful triangle of influence. He certainly playedgo-between to Joseph Chamberlain, whose motives in this saga are, to put itmildly, dubious.Stead’s relationship with Catherine Radziwill has generally been regarded aspurely professional, with him paying her to write articles on South Africa.However, it is likely that there was far more to their connection. Milner’sdislike of Radziwill is well known, though the extent of his venom remainsunexplained. Possibly the product of her attempt to come between him and Rhodesin furtherance of Stead’s cause, Milner’s antipathy could also have had a sexualbasis. Rhodes’s biographers seem generally to have had difficulties inattempting to decipher the contradictory nature of ensuing events involvingMilner and the Princess.In spite of the obvious disapproval of Rhodes’s gay entourage, CatherineRadziwill became a regular guest at Rhodes’s table, frequently seated beside herhost. Their friendship was so widely recognised that the Princess put it outthat they were engaged. Rhodes’s financial generosity and his attentiveness toher at Groote Schuur did nothing to dispel the gossip. Jameson, now in permanentresidence, and the numerous lambs who were known as ‘the bodyguard’, all beganto fear the loss of their patron. They watched anxiously as the loquaciousPrincess not only made eyes at Rhodes but was forever talking politics to him.Then, in a dramatic turn of events, Catherine Radziwill apparently turns tofraud, faking Rhodes’s signature on a number of promissory notes, and when thecourts find her guilty she is imprisoned in Cape Town. The reality is, however,diametrically and dramatically different from the official story. For atprecisely the point where Rhodes’s interest in the Princess seems to have ended,Stead makes a decisive move to ensure that he himself remains a player in theGame. He is still trustee of Rhodes’s will, but there are distant rumblings,with looming disagreements in the run-up to the Boer War. The Radziwill scandalis overtaken, albeit only temporarily, by this conflict.Rhodes had solved his post-raid legal problems by giving up control of theCharter Company and premiership of the Cape, but he was still determined tocrush Kruger and his Boers, and, thanks to the efforts of Stead and Brett, henow had Milner at his side. A disgraced Rhodes could not, of course, be seen tobe influencing Milner, though it is quite obvious that he was doing preciselythat. Milner pursued Rhodes’s line of attack and appeared even more contemptuousof the Boers. His negotiations with Kruger virtually amounted to ultimatums, forhe was convinced Kruger would not take on the might of the Empire.Unfortunately, Milner’s contempt for the old Boer leader overcame his politicaljudgement.Kruger declared war on 9 October 1899, and the Boers unpacked their German andFrench weapons which, in the first months of the war at least, brought theBritish Army to its knees. In military failure after failure, eventsunprecedented in the history of British colonial warfare occurred. Britishcasualties numbered in excess of 3,000 in the first week of fighting a bunch ofragtag amateurs that the British had expected to demolish.Cecil Rhodes, accompanied by his secretary Jourdan, as well as Maguire and hiswife, left for Kimberley the very night war was declared. Jameson headedstraight for Mafeking but turned back on the instruction of Baden-Powell: thelatter was in charge of the town’s defences without the advantage of artillery,and feared that the Boers would hit him hard if Dr Jim was known to be in town.Jameson rode off and spent the rest of the war in Ladysmith far to the east.Characteristically, Rhodes behaved as if Kimberley belonged to him, making manyunsolicited military decisions. He instructed the engineering works to make alarge artillery piece that fired homemade shells charged with quarry explosives.It was called ‘Long Cecil’. Rhodes soon fell out with Kimberley’s militarycommander, Colonel Kekewich, to the point where they no longer spoke to eachother – a situation that persisted for most of the siege. One laudable decisionRhodes made was to use his mine shafts as shelters, thereby saving the lives ofmany women and children. By this time he was also falling out with Stead, whowas vehemently opposed to the war. In an angry letter to Stead, Rhodes accusedhim of disloyalty and of jeopardising the Secret Society through his refusal tobe swayed by the decisions of the Elect – ‘your boys’ – in South Africa.An ostensibly cash-strapped Princess Radziwill returned to the Cape after anexpensive trip to Britain where she had many meetings with Stead, gainingseveral commissions at the same time. She had also met with the pro-Rhodesmanager of the The Times, Moberly Bell, and had lunch with the prime minister,Lord Salisbury – not bad going for a woman whose public image at the Cape wasthat of a destitute fortune-hunter! With Rhodes trapped in Kimberley, andfeelings running high against any form of federated South Africa, CatherineRadziwill now took it upon herself to negotiate an end to the Boer War. Theforce behind this decision was almost certainly Stead, though Moberly Bell alsohad a track record for this kind of interference.Catherine Radziwill was clearly exhibiting signs of being among Rhodes’s mostenthusiastic and loyal political supporters. This is clear from an observationin one of her many books: ‘Whilst in the Diamond City, Rhodes entered intosecret negotiations with some of the Dutch leaders … the sincere effort of atrue patriot to put an end to a struggle which was threatening to destroy theprosperity of a country for which he had laboured for so many years.’ There is amystery in this revelation, however, for how would she have known of these talksif Rhodes was cut off in Kimberley? The information certainly did not come fromMilner, who was convinced that the suppression of the Boers was the only way toachieve a federated South Africa, and who was in any case at daggers drawn withthe Princess.While Catherine Radziwill claimed to have insider knowledge on the subject,whether Rhodes did in fact make overtures to Boer leaders while in Kimberley isuncertain. There is no doubt, however, that while Rhodes was stranded during thesiege of Kimberley, the Princess herself decided to take on the job ofnegotiating with the Boers. She set up meetings with the leaders of theAfrikander Bond and began secret talks with them. In an attempt to explain herdecision, she later wrote: ‘From the bottom of his heart he [Rhodes] regrettedhis quarrel or rather his rupture with the Dutch side. I began then to work withall my heart to bring a reconciliation between them.’ That talks did take placewas confirmed by no less a person than J.W. Sauer, the Afrikander Bondspokesman: ‘Rhodes, through a close friend of his, in fact a political agent,was making efforts to arrange a new alliance with the leaders of the AfrikanderParty.’ This ‘close friend’ was undoubtedly the Princess, now confirmed as a‘political agent’, but apparently acting secretly as Rhodes’s representative.She also met John X. Merriman, the Cape Parliament’s most experiencedpolitician, telling him: ‘What we require here is a strong party which has inits ranks all the strong men as well as the powerful ones in South Africa.’By now the international press had got word that the Princess Radziwillrepresented powerful interests. Some said she was a Russian agent, others thatshe was in South Africa to spy for the British. The French prime minister,Georges Clemenceau, significantly raised her political credibility when he madethe following public comment: ‘Everyone in Paris knows that the woman is a Boeragent.’ It is simply not credible to suggest that Catherine Radziwill becameinvolved of her own volition in such controversial and clandestine politics inthe simple hope that she might appear more attractive to Rhodes. Quite theopposite, in fact: she knew that Rhodes did not like people – especially women –meddling in his political life. It is more credible to suggest that the Princesswas in fact Stead’s agent. Now that Milner had suffered such a setback with theBoer War, Stead may have tried to use her as the go-between with the Bond inorder to restore the Secret Society’s plan for a negotiated federation of theSouth African states. The war, if pursued to the end, threatened to alienate theDutch of the Cape forever – and they still held the political majority.Stead could not possibly have been so naive as to think that a European princesscould pull off a bloodless coup unaided. In the context of conservativeAfrikaner politics – especially Voortrekker politics – a woman’s place was inthe home rather than out playing the Great Game of politics. Therefore the morelikely scenario is that Catherine Radziwill enjoyed broader support, possiblyeven that of her friend, Lord Salisbury. This is not to suggest, however, thatthe Princess was not politically astute – a quality that is clear from herpersonal history. She was used to dealing with top politicians, had survived theintelligence services of both the Tsar and the Bolsheviks, and was wellacquainted with other female international agents like Maud Gonne and JulietteAdam. And in all this, Stead’s anxiety concerning his waning control of theSecret Society, plus his anti-Milner meddling, cannot be discounted.* * *Into this peculiar affair now steps a man who will come to feature large in thestory of Rhodes and his Secret Society, particularly as it evolved under Milner.Leopold Charles Maurice Stennett Amery – known as Leo – has been identified byQuigley as being part of the ‘real circle of initiates [of the Secret Society]in the 20th century’.Amery, twenty years younger than Rhodes, had come to South Africa as acorrespondent for The Times, and was quickly won over by Catherine Radziwill.Given the support of W.T. Stead and The Times for the Secret Society, it ispossible that Amery was in the country on a secret commission from Stead to givethe Princess a helping hand. Certainly she had Amery to meals at the MountNelson and fed him huge amounts of information. She told him of secret meetingswith the Afrikander Bond so that eventually Amery became convinced that she wasdeeply involved with the Bond leaders – significantly at a time when they werecondemning Rhodes as being behind the Jameson Raid. For Amery, the mostsignificant aspect of her pro-Rhodes lobbying was the fact that she consistentlyblamed Milner for the Boer War debacle. This was clearly Stead’s alternativegame plan if he had indeed lost Rhodes. Stead may even have regarded himself,now that Rhodes was in disgrace, as a more important lobbyist for the Societythan Milner – who seemed increasingly to be Rhodes’s favourite.In all this speculation, one thing is certain: the Princess Radziwill continuedto loathe Alfred Milner. She sent a stream of messages to Rhodes in Kimberleyinforming him of Milner’s duplicity, while at the same time writing articleswarning him not to believe the stories!In an attempt to make sense of all the conflicting reports – both to and fromthe Princess – Milner’s close confidant, the journalist Philip Lyttelton Gell,went to see Stead. He reported rather despairingly to Milner: ‘It has becomeabsolutely clear to me as we talked … that she is an active agent in the policyof getting things into a tangle … she has obviously tried to make Rhodes believeyou are animated by jealousy of him.’3 [part0037.html#ch17fn-3]If Catherine Radziwill was indeed playing all these games without Rhodes’sknowledge, it is easy to see why his admiration had soured. ‘Rhodes believedthis absurd fiction,’ she wrote (a ‘fiction’ largely of her own making,incidentally), ‘and learned to look upon Sir Alfred Milner as a natural enemy,desirous of thwarting him at every step.’ Article upon article espousingRhodes’s causes and political philosophy spun from the Princess’s prolific pen,with many being published in her newspaper, Greater Britain. She even attackedRhodes’s critic, Olive Schreiner, and in her book The Resurrection of Peter sheattempts to discredit Schreiner’s condemnation of Rhodes’s campaign against theShona and the Matabele.Her efforts came at a financial cost, and she was forced to pawn her jewelleryto keep her publisher paid, with her debts leading eventually to the allegedforging of Rhodes’s signature on promissory notes. While the amount involved –between £1,000 and £4,500 – was paltry by Rhodes’s standards, the allegedforgery of his name was no paltry matter. She consistently claimed that Rhodeshad given her the promissory notes to help her promote his name in the dark daysthat followed the raid. She pointed out that he had given her money on previousoccasions, paid her hotel bills, and after his return from Kimberley continuedto extend invitations to her. Rhodes himself was economical with the truth,denying he had ever discussed politics with the Princess – a claim that wasroundly contradicted by Jourdan. It was in fact her preoccupation with politicswhich, according to Jourdan, caused most of the rows between her and Rhodes.Rhodes himself was duplicitous, secretly buying back some of the promissorynotes from the Princess.But there is more to the mystery, stemming from a separate series of events thatinvolved Milner. Back in England, W.T. Stead persisted with his campaign –promoting it in the Review of Reviews – to reveal Chamberlain’s complicity inthe Jameson Raid. Then on 22 March 1900, at a meeting in London, Rhodesconvinced Stead that a deal with Chamberlain was for the best. They alsodiscussed Secret Society matters, in particular Milner’s position since becominghigh commissioner. It was at this meeting that Rhodes made a telling disclosureto Stead: the letters the Princess had sent while he was under siege inKimberley had caused bad blood between him and Milner, who, when Rhodesconfronted him, dismissed their contents as nonsense. And Rhodes trusted Milner.Rhodes and Stead parted with exaggerated displays of friendship. They huggedeach other warmly, and Bouchier Hawksley said he thought they might kiss eachother. However, things were never the same after that, and Rhodes wouldeventually replace Stead’s name with that of Milner in his final will. Steadhimself stuck by the Princess and placed articles written by her in the Americanpress, including the North American Review. These articles reflected Stead’sposition on Chamberlain, and included a widely read piece, ‘Cecil. J. Rhodes: Animpression by Princess Radziwill’, which would later form the basis of a book.Lyttelton Gell, who had acquired land in Rhodesia, and whom Quigley names as aSecret Society member, warned Milner that Stead had now ‘passed under the swayof the Princess Radziwill’.In truth, Catherine Radziwill is a tangle no one has ever satisfactorilyunravelled. Did Rhodes even know she was working for Stead? And what were herreal motives? She destituted herself for Rhodes and was passionate in hersupport of him, yet saw Rhodes return angrily to South Africa to appear before acourt and denounce her. She must have realised that her political interferencewould alienate Rhodes, yet she pursued her own (or Stead’s) agenda for years,long after it had destroyed any chance of ever marrying Rhodes.It is a known fact that there were undercurrents of animosity between Stead andMilner and the Princess and Milner, and there is even the possibility that shewas an agent for other political interests in Britain. A diary entry recordsthat, during her visit to see Stead, she had also had secret talks with LordSalisbury at his home, where the prime minister spent much of his timecriticising Rhodes. Doubt has been cast on the veracity of her diaries, butthere is no more reason for disbelieving them than there is for Brett’sJournals. Sceptics have suggested that Lord Salisbury would not have discussedpolitics with a woman, but we know that Catherine Radziwill was adept at talkingpolitics with men, even when they were dour Boers. Stead made sure in the Reviewof Reviews that the public knew of the Princess Radziwill’s visit with the primeminister, describing her as ‘a life-long friend of Disraeli’s’ and confirmingthat her acquaintance with Lord Salisbury ‘has continued down to the presenthour’. Stead put his own interests on record by urging her in the same articleto ‘take a hand in the political game in South Africa’.Armed with this potent patronage, Catherine Radziwill set sail for Cape Town.Once again, she seemed determined to bring Milner down. She had been given aletter from Stead to give to Rhodes, with strict instructions that she was todeliver it to no one but him."},{"pageContent":"18Trials of LifeUpon arrival in Cape Town in January 1901, Catherine Radziwill opened Stead’sletter to Rhodes and read it. So disturbed was she by its contents, she claims,that she decided not to deliver it. The letter has never been published but itsprovenance is confirmed in reliable subsequent correspondence. The Princessfollowed at least part of Stead’s instructions by inviting herself to lunch atGroote Schuur the day after her arrival on 22 January – the same day Rhodeshimself returned to Cape Town.Here again, the ‘official’ record of Rhodes and the Princess trips over itself.On the one hand there is the popular myth of a Rhodes desperate to avoid thePrincess, protected by his wall of brawny bachelor boys as well as by Jamesonand Metcalfe. On the other hand, we have the Princess joining Rhodes for lunchat his home. Gaily reporting on this, Gordon le Sueur says with some certaintythat she ‘cordially hated not only Jourdan, but Grimmer and myself’. Thoughprobably true, it is likely that Catherine Radziwill was more than a match forthese boys – and it certainly did not stop her arriving for lunch the next dayalso, and being a regular guest for some time afterwards. It is ludicrous tosuggest that if Rhodes hadn’t wanted the Princess at his table, he and hisall-male household could not have put a stop to it.That is not to say that Rhodes could not be rude and unwelcoming, but thisbehaviour was not reserved for the Princess. Francis Dormer, a journalist whohad known Rhodes for some twenty years, had this to say of the choleric,cantankerous Rhodes of 1901: ‘I have had occasion to discover during the pastfew weeks that he has ceased to be the Cecil Rhodes that he used to be; that hehas come under the influence of new men and an altogether new set of ideas.’Even his oldest friend, Sidney Shippard, was losing patience with him: ‘Rhodeshas been so long surrounded by men who defer to him in every way, and hang onhis every utterance as though it were that of an oracle, that he can no longerbrook even a difference of opinion.’ The best description of all came fromCatherine Radziwill herself, writing many years later:A man supposed to have an iron will, yet he was weak almost to childishness inregard to those flattering satellites. It amused him to have always at his beckand call people ready and willing to submit to his insults, to bear with hisfits of bad temper, and accept every humiliation which he chose to offer. CecilRhodes never saw, never affected to see, the disastrous influence all this hadon his life.These opinions signal not merely shifts in people’s attitudes, but aresymptomatic of a seismic shift in the Secret Society itself. Rhodes and hisclosest cronies were moving in a different direction to Stead and the rest – andthe crony to watch was indubitably Alfred Milner. Further signs of the splitcame with the publication of Stead’s The Candidates of Cain, where he openlyaccused the foreign secretary of active complicity in the Jameson Raid:‘[Chamberlain] was in it up to his neck.’ This came out when Jameson himself wasin England, having been sent there by Rhodes essentially to shut Stead up.Catherine Radziwill’s own account of the letter she read out at that fatefulluncheon at Groote Schuur is revealing. At the table were Rhodes, Jameson,Metcalfe, and Rhodes’s neighbour and friend, T.E. Fuller. She recalls: ‘Ienjoyed myself by reading loudly a letter from Mr. Stead relating to them.’Rhodes, she says, sat listening in stunned silence. Then Metcalfe got up andleft the room, while Jameson and Fuller took refuge on the veranda. When Rhodeshimself stood up and left, the Princess followed him into the house where theyhad a ‘violent quarrel’. She later stated the following in a legal affidavit:Mr. Rhodes wanted me to do certain things which I positively refused to do … Oneof the things Mr. Rhodes wanted me to do was to write on certain points to LordMilner, and when I got Lord Milner’s reply to tell him the text of the reply. Iwas not in a position to do so and declined. We had a violent quarrel, and Isaid whatever communication passed I would not communicate them to Mr. Rhodes.That was one of the points. Then he wanted me to return certain documents whichI possessed, amongst others the copy of a letter from Mr. Stead … I utterlyrefused to return it.In subsequent private conversations the Princess is alleged to have claimed shehad in her possession letters, some of which were ‘very compromising for certainpersons’ while others had been ‘stolen from their proprietors’. It is generallybelieved that these were letters stolen from Rhodes, possibly by the Princessherself.The really puzzling aspect of this affair is Rhodes’s alleged insistence thatthe Princess should write immediately to Milner and inform Rhodes of his reply.Apparently suspecting Milner of keeping ‘certain points’ from him, Rhodesdemanded that she probe and report back to him. There is also Stead’s suggestionthat Jameson had told lies about Catherine Radziwill. Was Stead perhaps tryingto warn Rhodes that his senior cronies could not be trusted? Casting doubts onMilner’s trustworthiness was a serious charge. If true, however, and if thePrincess was prepared to disclose Milner’s disloyalty, this might have restoredStead’s position vis-a-vis Rhodes.The letter, never since published, was a ticking bomb. And if, as CatherineRadziwill claims, she refused Rhodes’s request to spy on Milner, this may havebeen a matter on which she needed to consult her spymaster – most likely Stead,but possibly Lord Salisbury. Whatever the case – and this is a secret both havetaken to their graves – Rhodes slammed the door on her when she refused tocooperate, and they never again communicated with each other.There has been much speculation as to what was in these documents. The consensusis that they contained information that revealed differences of opinion betweenMilner and Rhodes, possibly about the Boers, and Milner’s miscalculationsregarding Kruger’s obduracy and resolve. There is ample evidence to support thissupposition. Catherine Radziwill is confirmed as working long and hard for anegotiated peace with the Boers, thereby jeopardising her own position withRhodes. And Rhodes himself had been supportive of the Boers of the Cape underJan Hofmeyr. So there is every possibility that the Princess had secretlynegotiated with the Boers – possibly even on behalf of Rhodes himself.Milner’s own views were set in stone. He was never anything but icilyuncompromising with Kruger, whom he regarded as the main stumbling block to theSecret Society’s master plan for a federated Empire. Milner – like the CapeTimes editor Garrett and the respected junior proconsul Sir Sidney Shippard –had by this time begun to doubt Rhodes, not only for the company he kept butalso for his drinking habits.After the uncomfortable luncheon at Groote Schuur, the imperturbable CatherineRadziwill bought herself a typewriter and began to put together her newspaperGreater Britain. She told her printer not to worry about the bills as Rhodeshimself would pay. Biographers down the years have puzzled over the Princess’ssangfroid, but she may well have been a good deal more Machiavellian than anyonehas yet given her credit for.Greater Britain was pro-Rhodes, pro-Britain and pro-Empire. But it alsopresented Rhodes in a role he no longer wished to play, and which Milnerdisapproved of: pro-Voortrekker Boer, appeaser and peacemaker. Meanwhile, thePrincess projected the image of a campaigning publisher, with Rhodes ostensiblyher man and Stead her mentor. In the event, Rhodes did not pay the printer’sbills, and without his backing Greater Britain failed after three issues. In astate of friendless penury, and after the promissory-note allegations, thePrincess was pursued by half a dozen lawyers (none of whom admitted that theywere working for Rhodes). She grew so desperate that she threatened suicide toher friends, Dr Sholtz and his wife. Meanwhile, behind the scenes a vengefulMilner tried every trick to get her to give up the letters, and on 2 November DrSholtz sent a letter offering to pay her passage back to Europe – but at aprice. ‘I could assist you to secure food,’ wrote the doctor, ‘but on conditionthat you give up the letters.’Catherine Radziwill kept all the letters, though bits of them leaked out. In aletter to Milner, she claimed not only that Rhodes had agreed to support GreaterBritain and given her the signed promissory notes, but that he denied signingthem because she had refused to spy on Milner and to hand over letters toRhodes. While it is possible that she was not above forgery, stalking and lying,this version better fits the facts than the Rhodes–Milner versions. She had beengiven money by Rhodes before, and there is no reason why he should not havefunded Greater Britain too. Moreover, W.T. Stead himself had met part of theproduction costs by paying for an ‘agent’ to go out to South Africa and helpwith the newspaper. Finally, there is the obvious fact that she could notpossibly have supported this weekly publication on her meagre savings.The missing piece in the puzzle may be Milner who, in 1900, suspected that Steadand possibly even Rhodes were dispensable. Rhodes, increasingly overweight andirritable, was not at all reliable. Milner had his own plans for the SecretSociety, indeed had already begun to train a new administrative staff. CatherineRadziwill was seen as Stead’s agent, which meant she had to be disposed of too.On 11 November the Princess had a visit from an officer from the Committee ofImperial Defence in Cape Town who, she alleges, enquired whether they were‘alone’. Officer Widowson explained that he had been sent by Milner on aconfidential mission:‘Madam’, then said my interlocutor, ‘the English Government knows that you havesome documents, interesting for him [Milner]. I come to tell you that, if yougive them to me, we should arrange that you should be largely rewarded.’ I lostmy coolness in the presence of such a proposition and gave full vent to myindignation. With vehemence I refused as I had formerly refused to give away mydocuments to C. Rhodes. The officer, vexed, went away.Time was now running out on the war front. Milner delivered his ultimatum toKruger – but the Boer leader called his bluff, and the Radziwill scandal wastemporarily driven from the headlines as the tiny Boer army with its armoury ofGerman ordnance embarked on a bloody massacre of the British.Milner and Rhodes thought they had the British government squared with regard tothe war. Lord Salisbury had permitted Chamberlain his ‘lying in state atWestminster’, and Rhodes kept to his side of the cover-up deal by, for a while,lying low in Rhodesia and giving up his chairmanship of the British South AfricaCompany. The Secret Society would likewise have believed they had the oppositionsquared: its leader, Lord Rosebery, had dismissed the Jameson Raid as an‘Elizabethan adventure’, after all.1 [part0037.html#ch18fn-1]On to this battlefield strides an unlikely David: David Lloyd George, theelegant and eloquent Welsh Liberal who had announced in a letter to his brotherhis decision to campaign for the Boers: ‘If I have the courage I shall protestwith all the vehemence at my command against the outrage which is perpetrated inthe name of freedom.’ At Penarth, on 28 November 1896, Lloyd-George launched avitriolic attack on the Jameson Raid: ‘South Africa, a small republic, with anarmy the size of an ordinary German principality, has been able to defy GreatBritain.’ His reference to Germany was no accident, and, ignoring Britishjingoism, he went straight to the heart of the matter: ‘The way these poorhunted burghers have been driven in self-defence to forestall us aggravates ourcrime. There is something diabolical in its malignity.’ Ignoring the riotousoutcry, he continued the tirade: ‘I would be recreant before God and man if, inaddressing my fellow countrymen, I did not offer a protest against what Iconsider an infamy. I will do it tonight if I leave Carmarthen tomorrow withouta friend to bid me good-bye.’After one such meeting, Lloyd George had to run the gauntlet of a furious crowd,was hit on the head with a heavy stick, and had to be thrown by the police intoa cab. He compared the Boers to the ‘old Welsh Puritans of this country’ andthen went on: ‘They are fine men, more godly men than those for whom we arefighting.’ The Uitlanders and their supporters were, on the other hand,degenerates: ‘German Jews, 15,000 – 20,000 of them.’This was clearly directed at Rhodes’s Jewish partners – Alfred Beit, BarneyBarnato and Nathan Rothschild. Lloyd George was supported in this anti-Semiticattack by several British politicians, including Keir Hardie, the first LabourParty MP, who proceeded to promote a motion which attributed the war largely toJews and foreigners.Milner and Rhodes closed ranks, with public opinion eventually coming to theirrescue. In 1899, in what came to be known as ‘Black Week’, 719 British Tommieswere lost at Stormberg, 950 at Magersfontein, and 1,100 at Colenso. It was onlywhen it emerged that the casualties were largely the result of sharpshooterswielding superior German weaponry that Lloyd George softened his rhetoric.It took the defeat of the British Army by a grossly outnumbered Boer commando atSpioen Kop for the Queen to summon the prime minister, Arthur Balfour – LordSalisbury’s successor, who also happened to be his nephew. Balfour wasperemptorily instructed: ‘We are not interested in the possibilities of defeat.They do not exist.’ The public felt differently, however, with Lloyd Georgehaving just survived a riotous meeting in Glasgow: ‘The worst public meeting rowI have ever witnessed – 10,000 people outside trying to break into the meeting –surging, struggling, fighting, yelling like savages and a small Armageddon goingon inside.’ But the government listened to the Queen. It poured more troops intoSouth Africa, just as it had after the slaughter at Isandlwana many yearsbefore. Lord Roberts replaced Sir Redvers Buller as commander-in-chief, and inMay 1900, Mafeking – which had been under siege for 217 days – was relieved. Aswas Kimberley, sometime later.Rhodes was free again – and dangerous, in the view of Lloyd George. Two monthslater, in July, the feisty Welshman went back to Parliament to make a fightingspeech. It was clear that he had taken the measure of Rhodes, Chamberlain, andparticularly Milner: ‘A war of annexation against a proud people must be a warof extermination and that seems to be what we are committing ourselves to –burning homesteads and turning women and children out of their homes.’ However,Balfour’s Conservatives still had a winning card up their sleeves, and on 25September they played it by dissolving Parliament at the peak of thenationalistic war fever and going to the country. ‘A seat lost to theGovernment,’ said Chamberlain, ‘is a seat gained by the Boers.’One of the seats at risk in the proposed election would almost certainly be thatof Lloyd George. He backtracked rapidly, describing his earlier stance as ‘anhonest mistake’, and joined those who proposed that the Transvaal should accepthome rule within the Empire. He was re-elected with a majority of just 296votes. Fifteen years hence he would be prime minister, and closely allied to theSecret Society run by Milner. During this period his anti-Semitic leanings wouldgain a special significance.The Boers now reverted to the commando2 [part0037.html#ch18fn-2] warfare theyhad pioneered: small roving bands on horseback, each a sharpshooter, lived offthe country and launched guerrilla-style attacks wherever they found theBritish. With their German Mausers, the Boer snipers took a small but steadytoll, and then vanished into the landscape. ‘It is a most frustrating problem,’an irritated Kitchener remarked in February 1901, by which time the war hadeffectively been won, ‘an enemy that always escapes, a country so vast there isalways room to escape, supplies such as they want abundant almost everywhere.’Kitchener launched his notorious ‘scorched-earth policy’, clearing great swathesof the country of all living persons. The Boer refugees created by thisattrition were sent to camps as far afield as St Helena Island and Colombo inCeylon. Undeterred, the commandos fought on. Emily Hobhouse, an English Quaker,disembarked in South Africa with twelve tons of clothing on behalf of the SouthAfrican Women and Children Distress Fund. She was appalled at what shewitnessed, and described one camp where ‘some twenty to twenty-five people werecarried away daily … it was a death rate such as had never been known except inthe times of the Great Plagues’.Oblivious to the suffering and sensing victory, Milner and Chamberlain vetoedall dealings with the Boers other than unconditional surrender. They rejected anoffer by Kitchener of an amnesty for Boer fighters who agreed to lay down theirarms immediately. Instead, the Boer commandos took to the veld, leavingKitchener concerned that a future South Africa might see the Boers provoked intoa permanent state of rebellion with the formation of hill bandits. With peoplesteeped in so much hatred, it seemed an impossibility to bring them to the peacetable.Lloyd George, increasingly isolated and aware that he was splitting his ownparty – terminally, as it turned out – fought on. Upon enquiring about the highcasualty rates, the secretary for war, St John Brodrick, callously replied: ‘[Icannot] be expected to remember all the statistics – War is War.’ Outraged bythis response, Lloyd George shot back: ‘When is war not a war? When it iscarried out by methods of Barbarism in South Africa.’ Later, at a meeting inBirmingham, a mob armed with stones, bricks, bottles and cans attacked theplatform where Lloyd George was standing, and he was smuggled out disguised as apoliceman. The mob then began to smash windows, resulting in a police batoncharge that was not enough, however, to save the life of a man who was killed.While the Boer War may for a time have made Lloyd George the most unpopular manin England, it also made his name. Afterwards he became Chancellor of theExchequer, creating the welfare state, and some years later, as prime minister –and with Milner at his side – he would go down in history as having ‘won’ theFirst World War.Against all these odds, however, by the turn of the twentieth century peace wasin the air in South Africa, and when Kitchener overruled Milner in May 1901 andmet sixty representatives of the commando groups, Lloyd George realised it wastime to retreat, and to rescue his career. Some ten years later he wrote: ‘Onthe Day of Judgement when I have to answer for my sins – and God knows I haveenough to answer for – I shall say one thing, “Sir, I was a pro Boer”. And hewill let me in.’This was in sharp contrast to Milner’s position. He insisted on peace termswhich would humiliate the Boers, whereas Kitchener wanted post-warreconciliation. Milner also blocked Boer terms for the settlement of war debts,describing them as ‘detestable’ and ‘preposterous’. When, finally, on 31 May1902 the Boers signed their unpopular peace treaty, Milner had already workedout the Secret Society’s game plan. He told a journalist, H. Spencer Wilkinson:‘It is quite true we hold the winning cards, but it is not true we have won thegame, and we cannot afford to lose a single trick.’One of the ‘tricks’ Milner was seemingly nervous of losing was the lettersCatherine Radziwill still had in her possession. In Cecil Rhodes and thePrincess, Brian Roberts puts his finger on the importance Milner attached to theepistles:The war was still dragging on and he was extremely busy. Why then was he sointerested in the hysterical outbursts of a foreign adventuress? How couldCatherine have letters of his which were of vital importance to Cecil Rhodes?But there can be no question that he was interested. He not only investigatedthe matter but detailed one of his top men to carry out the investigation. Therewas obviously much more to the Princess’s intrigues than anyone was prepared toadmit.Milner decided that the only way to seal the Princess’s lips was a combinationof bribes and threats of court action. Being who she was, of course, shevociferously rejected all offers and threats.Rhodes, in the meantime, was in London minding his businesses – De Beers and theCharter Company. He rode every day in Hyde Park, and found time to see DrKingston Fowler about his breathlessness. Fowler seems to have been something ofa quack. However, like Rhodes, he was a bachelor, and as one wag put it, wasknown for his numerous male friends ‘of distinction in walks of life other thanmedical’. Having been instructed to go on holiday, Rhodes went to Scotland fortwo weeks shooting. Three weeks later he made a brief return to the Cape, thenimmediately embarked on an arduous five-month safari in Rhodesia.Shortly before leaving for Scotland, however, Rhodes had a terminal falling-outwith Stead. They discussed the war and Rhodes pledged support for Milner. At thesame time, there is evidence that Milner had started to question Rhodes’s futurerole in the Secret Society, perhaps especially in light of his condition. Milnerwrote to his close friend, Philip Lyttelton Gell: ‘We have separate & successiveparts to play in one policy – mine is to make British S. Africa, including theAfrikaner, but as real British subjects, possible (in order to do that theimperial harrow may have to pass over the whole field). He [Rhodes] is to governand consolidate the new community when my work is done.’ Milner went on to warnGell that this preparatory work had to be completed ‘before a self-governing,all-embracing nation … the basis of a clear unquestioning and unquestionablemembership of the British group of nations, could be laid’.As for Catherine Radziwill, Milner vents his spleen in a second letter toLyttelton Gell: ‘She is a beast. Strange how sex enters into these great mattersof state. It always has, always will. It is never recorded, therefore historynever will be intelligible.’ He then voices his suspicions about the Princessbeing in cahoots with Stead, whom he clearly dislikes too: ‘Princess R— is to methe most repulsive animal imaginable but there is no doubt that she did have(not in the coarse sense) a hold over Rhodes. 100 to 1 she has it over Stead(that) most susceptible mortal to the most fleshy type of feminine charm. She isDangerous.’ There is no need to read between these lines, which blatantly exposeLord Milner’s attitude to women and to sex in general. Nevertheless, hisstatement that sex is ‘not recorded’ in ‘matters of state’ is significant.Indeed, the question of sex and sexuality has generally been glossed over inrelation to the political decisions and actions of both Rhodes and Milner.Still, Milner’s focus here – the suggestion that Rhodes was attracted by a‘fleshy type of feminine charm’, and may even have contemplated having sex witha ‘repulsive animal’ – reveals Milner’s prejudices and phobias. Again, Milner’sreaction is extreme, and if there is indeed any lurking danger, he is the one towatch rather than the Princess, who had in any case been brought to court.Rhodes claims he first got wind of the promissory-note allegations whilevoyaging to London. Lewis Michell, his banker, sought confirmation that thefirst £435 note was indeed under Rhodes’s signature. In Madeira a secondtelegram awaited Rhodes from his lawyer, Hawksley, indicating that another notefor £6,300 had turned up in London. Both notes were later withdrawn by thePrincess when Rhodes questioned the signatures. When another note for £4,500appeared, Rhodes inserted a notice in the Cape Town newspapers and also in TheTimes denying he had signed any promissory notes in favour of CatherineRadziwill, who accordingly appeared guilty.In reality, however, several mysterious moneylenders and lawyers, one of whomworked secretly for Rhodes, had appeared on the scene. The Princess also pickedup a few equally mysterious benefactors, including a Mr Louw who bought back oneof the notes, and a Miss Flowers who seemingly underwrote most of the Princess’sdebts. One might also suspect the hand of Stead, or perhaps even the Boers, inall this.When he got back from Scotland, Rhodes travelled to Egypt, but he had no soonerarrived there than the heat drove him back to England. According to Gordon leSueur, ‘His face was bloated, almost swollen … he was livid with a purpletinge.’ To Le Sueur, Rhodes seemed ‘very ill indeed’.A few days later, Rhodes surprised the lambs and Charlie Metcalfe by announcinghis return to South Africa, where, in January, it can be almost as hot as Egypt.He ignored the advice of local doctors who were concerned about the state of hisheart, and merely asked Dr Jameson to accompany him. Referring to the Princess,Rhodes insisted to friends: ‘No risk will prevent me clearing my character ofany stain in connection with that woman.’ Again and again he repeated, ‘I mustgo and defend my honour,’ and the only way he could do this was ‘by upsettingthe bona fides of the Princess’. He was determined that no one should believeher about matters relating to money – or about the letters.The case was further complicated by the fact that the Princess had appointed anew lawyer, a Mr Michau, when she arrived in court on 28 April 1901. Themysterious Michau had an interesting past: he was an Afrikaner who had beeninterred by the British for his Boer sympathies. Only later did it emerge that,at the time he represented the Princess, he was occupying the position ofsecretary of the Afrikander Bond! The question then arises: was CatherineRadziwill indeed a Boer agent, as the French had suggested? And was the truthabout her alleged negotiations with the Boers that they had in fact beennegotiating via her? If this was the case, it would have given Milner everyreason for loathing her to the extent he did. Whatever the truth, it was yetanother secret she took to her grave.Rhodes believed that if Catherine Radziwill was proved in court to be a liar anda forger he would finally be rid of her, and that all the rumours would finallybe put to bed. He was assisted by T.K. Graham, the attorney general, who wasalso the prosecutor, and who resisted all attempts to have the Stead letterintroduced in evidence. When her lawyers cabled Stead to enquire as to whetherhe had given the Princess a letter for Rhodes, Stead replied in the affirmative.This is further confirmation that she was an agent of Stead’s, acting as hissecret courier.This should have upset the case for the prosecution, but Graham was permitted inhis address to the jury to make a damning assertion: the Princess’s papers werenothing more than ‘an attempt to mystify the jury by reference to mysterioustelegrams from hare-brained individuals like Mr. Stead and others, byallegations that she had in her possession certain important incriminatingdocuments – the ordinary armoury of the blackmailer – from various persons’.Even a jury in faraway Cape Town must have known that to describe W.T. Stead asa ‘hare-brained individual’ amounted to gross distortion. And if the Princess’sletters were not in fact ‘incriminating’, why was Milner so keen to suppressthem?The jury conferred for forty-five minutes, and during this time the accused wasseen to toss a coin with her counsel! She was sentenced to two years’imprisonment, though the judge spared her hard labour. ‘If that is justice,’ shedeclared in a comment clearly directed at Milner, ‘I pity those who areadministered by people having such a peculiar idea of it.’ She maintained herinnocence to the last, and in a letter to Jameson she said of Rhodes: ‘Herepeated in the [Cape Town] Supreme Court his experiences before the SelectCommittee [of the British Parliament] … he perjured himself to save Mr.Chamberlain.’Time has shown that the Princess Radziwill did not get a fair trial. Thepresiding judge, Chief Justice Sir Henry de Villiers, having handed down ajudgment in a previous case, was in fact unfit to try the Princess. Sir Henryalso wrongfully refused to admit evidence – a letter belonging to the accused –which he pre-judged as a ‘document got by treachery’. And so it was that thePrincess Catherine Radziwill was sent to prison without having revealed thecontents of the letters – and with Rhodes breathing a sigh of relief.Yet the irony is that Rhodes was not breathing at all by then. The Colossus haddied fighting for breath in a little cottage in Muizenberg surrounded by hisentourage: Jameson, Metcalfe, Beit, Le Sueur, Jourdan, and even Johnny Grimmer,who had travelled down from Rhodesia. And so it was that Cecil John Rhodesbreathed his last on 26 March 1902, at three minutes to six in the morning."},{"pageContent":"PART TWOMILNER"},{"pageContent":"19ShadowlandsThe body inside its lead-lined coffin was loaded onto a special train draped inblack and purple that steamed slowly northwards across the arid South Africanlandscape. Once it reached Rhodesia, it was transported across Matabeleland bymule train to a spectacular outcrop of rounded granite hills. On top of the mostprominent of the rocky outcrops, a large hole had been carved out of thegranite. The inscription on the Matopos tomb was as brief as it wasunostentatious: Here lie the remains of Cecil John Rhodes. The Colossus haddecided against a stone slab at Westminster Abbey alongside the likes of hisimperial architect Herbert Baker.The mules transporting Rhodes’s coffin were probably hired from George Elcombeand Co. In all likelihood they were the ancestors of the feral mules my brotherand I tried to catch, corral and ride as wild young boys. In those bygone daysRhodesia was still a ‘settler’s paradise’ and land could be had for a song. I’dbeen taught to regard Rhodes as ‘The Founder’, a guiding spirit in theshadowlands, something between God and Kipling’s ‘immense and brooding Spirit’,which Sarah Gertrude Millin vividly evoked: ‘A gun-carriage, drawn by twelveoxen, carried the coffin up the black slope of his hill. The hill was swarmingwith the Matabele he had won and betrayed and won again and succoured. “Ourfather is dead!” they cried, and gave him, alone of white men before or since,the royal salute of “Bayete!”’Rudyard Kipling, deeply bonded to the Secret Society, gave momentum to thegrowing legend in his memorial poem, ‘The Burial’, that was read at thegraveside by the bishop of Mashonaland:There, till the vision he foresawSplendid and whole arise,And unimagined Empires drawTo council ’neath his skies,The immense and brooding Spirit stillShall quicken and control.Living he was the land, and dead,His soul shall be her soul!Here was the Confession of Faith, expressed in verse form.Jameson had also embellished the legend by telling the crowd gathered outsidethe Muizenberg cottage that Rhodes’s last words were: ‘So much to do, so littledone’ – or, as Sir Lewis Michell has it, ‘So little done, so much to do’. Thisbecame a catchphrase that was beaten into us almost daily at Churchill HighSchool. Years later, I was cheered to discover that Rhodes’s actual last words,addressed to Johnny Grimmer, were rather more prosaic: ‘Turn me over, Johnny.’A post-mortem of sorts had been carried out on the corpse, and a few days latertwo contrasting versions of an autopsy report were produced. The first, by localdoctor S.B. Syfret, confirmed the suspicions of other medical practitioners,including Jameson: a ‘large cardiac aneurysm which blocked the circulation’. Thesecond report promised a ‘detailed letter’. To this day, the official autopsylacks this letter, which somehow failed to reach Rhodes’s estate or any otherarchive. Coupled with the fact that the autopsy was conducted privately andinformally and was never followed up with an official examination, this missingreport has fuelled many a conspiracy theory.Various experts speculated at the time that Rhodes may have died ofcomplications from syphilis – at the time a common cause of aneurysm; or perhapsfrom atrial fibrillation precipitated by a bout of malarial fever; or even from‘a hole in the heart’. Lord Milner’s wife is said to have pronounced waspishly,‘It was that woman that killed him.’ She may well have been right, consideringthe rages the defiant Princess Radziwill provoked, not to mention thechain-smoking and heavy drinking which accompanied Rhodes’s tantrums in thelatter stage of his life.Unless that missing page from the autopsy turns up, history will remain ignorantas to the real facts of Rhodes’s death. In the months following his demise, hispapers suffered a considerable cull – as indeed did the papers of Beit. The realtruth about Rhodes became proscribed territory, and from the time he died themyth of Rhodes the Colossus, the Founder, the Immense and Brooding Spirit, beganto rise from his lonely grave. And so, the real story of Rhodes may be said tobegin with his death.1 [part0037.html#ch19fn-1]Paradoxically, perhaps, Rhodes’s death changed everything – and nothing. Theinstitutions of the Secret Society expanded, and the anglicisation of SouthAfrica went ahead under Milner far more efficiently than Rhodes could haveimagined. There is clear evidence that Milner began immediately to transform theSecret Society into a more modern, far more complex, though still clandestinesociety of his own design. His task began with South Africa. He told the ForeignOffice he would convert the Transvaal into a British domain where ‘Britishinterests, British ideas and British education’ would prevail. He explains: ‘Iattach the greatest importance of all to the increase in the British population.If ten years hence, there are three men of British race to two of Dutch, thecountry will be safe and prosperous. If there are three of Dutch and two ofBritish we shall have perpetual difficulty.’ Years before, Rhodes had expressedsimilar sentiments in a letter to Lord Grey: ‘We shall never be safe until weoccupy the soil equally with the Dutch.’It is ironic that this arch-Anglophile and passionate imperialist had a Germanfather, and was born in Germany. In 1854 Alfred Milner’s English mother gavebirth to him in the Hessian town of Giesen. His early education was in Tübingen.From there he went to England, where he attended King’s College School, and from1872 to 1876 he was a student at Oxford. Though only a year ahead of Rhodes,there is no evidence that Milner knew him as a student. The two were, however,subject to similar influences, in particular the political radicalism of Ruskinand Arnold Toynbee’s social Darwinism. While Rhodes subscribed only to certainelements of Ruskin’s thought, Milner was an acolyte, and he was also a devotedfriend of Toynbee. In spite of their different personalities, Milner and Rhodesshared similar political attitudes. However, while Rhodes is remembered for thegrandeur and scope, as well as the foolishness and cruelty, of his imperialvision, Milner is hardly remembered at all. His was a somewhat narrower vision –an imperial federation of British nations – yet it was no less ambitious. Toachieve this, he trained a team of talented young men to run a newly envisionedSecret Society that would usher in a new world order.Rhodes’s ideal – his Secret Society – underwent a radical transformation.Carroll Quigley labels it the Milner Group, though at heart it was still the oldSecret Society: ‘Of the six men whom Milner inherited from Rhodes2[part0037.html#ch19fn-2] only one was young enough to become an active member ofthe Milner Group.’ Milner’s trainee secretariat became known as the MilnerKindergarten, and R.S. Holland was initially the leading light of this otherwiseshadowy group. It implemented the policies of the Society until Milnereventually came up with a new structure and a new name, a process which took anumber of years.‘The character of the secret society and its personnel was changed after 1902,’Quigley confirms. ‘This was the result of the activities of Lord Milner. Thedeath of Rhodes and the elimination of Stead gave the organization a much lessmelodramatic form while making it a much more potent political instrument.’While Rothschild, Johnston, Hawksley, Rosebery, Jameson, Michell and Maguire allremained active, they became like the old Society of Helpers. The key players –Milner, Grey, Brett and Balfour – continued to form the core of the Societywhile Milner worked on the new structure.During this transformation of the Secret Society, Milner kept things covert andunder strict control, so there is little hard evidence of its existence at thistime. Indeed, those who contend that there never was any such society point tothis particular period – which, if anything, was a time of maximum growth of theSecret Society. Liberated from Rhodes’s esoteric disciplinary structures, thenew Milner Group was that much easier to join. Its inner circle included AbeBailey, George Parkin, Lord Selborne, General Jan Christiaan Smuts, Arthur J.Glazebrook, Robert Henry Brand, Philip Kerr (Lord Lothian), Lionel Curtis,Geoffrey Dawson, historian and Liberal politician H.A.L. Fisher, Edward Grigg,Leopold Amery and Lord Astor.3 [part0037.html#ch19fn-3] Having named itsmembers, Quigley continues: ‘This circle we shall call the “inner core” or the“inner circle” of the Milner Group.’ He then produces long, meticulous lists,sorting the active members from the fellow travellers, and the Elect from theInitiates. While this new cadre was being recruited, Milner’s essentialobjectives remained remarkably close to those of Rhodes, incorporating many ofthe influences and ideas they had shared in their formative years.* * *To trace the origins of Milner’s recruitment of the new cadre, it is necessaryto go back twenty years to 1873, when Milner’s time at Balliol overlapped withthe term Rhodes spent at Oriel.4 [part0037.html#ch19fn-4] They would both havecome into contact with the ideas of George Parkin, a Canadian who in 1873 spenta year at Balliol. While there, Parkin made a famous speech to the Oxford Unionadvocating ‘a closer union between England and her colonies’ in the form of an‘imperial federation’.5 [part0037.html#ch19fn-5]Milner and Parkin became lifelong friends, and just before taking up his post inSouth Africa in 1897, Milner wrote to Parkin telling him that he had been‘greatly influenced’ by his ideas, and that in his new position he would ‘morethan ever’ appreciate Parkin’s ‘enthusiasm and broad hopeful view of theImperial future’. While this underlines Milner’s ongoing commitment to Rhodes’svision, it also recalls Parkin’s Oxford Union address a quarter of a centurypreviously, which itself repeats verbatim certain words and phrases in Rhodes’sConfession of Faith.Parkin became the first of Milner’s emissaries sent ‘on missions of propagandathroughout the Empire’.6 [part0037.html#ch19fn-6] By the late 1890s, Parkin wasworking for an organisation known as the Imperial Defence League and hadlectured on the topic in New Zealand, Australia and Canada. On a subsidy raisedby Lord Rosebery and others, Parkin published Imperial Federation in 1892, andon 24 April 1893 Milner offered to form a group of imperialists who wouldfinance Parkin’s work on a more stable basis. As a result, Parkin was paid anannual fee of £450 for three years to propagate globally the notion of ‘imperialsolidarity’ – an enterprise Rhodes himself would surely have been party to.Certain early scholars of Rhodes who lacked the advantage of access to Brett’sJournals or Stead’s revelations after Rhodes’s death have suggested that thisgroup of imperialists was the real Secret Society, and that Rhodes had in factjoined Milner, rather than the other way around. But that is not the case:Rhodes, Stead and Brett were hand in glove well before Brett eventuallyaccompanied his friend Milner to South Africa to receive his posting.Other scholars have argued that the Secret Society died out with Rhodes’s death.Dr Frank Aydelotte, an authority on Rhodes’s wills, claims that in his sixthwill ‘Rhodes abandons forever his youthful idea of a secret society’. Again thisis wrong. While it is true that Rhodes’s last will does not contain the famouscodicil announcing his ambitious intention to form his Secret Society, it didnot need to: by then Milner and the others had for years been members of asecret society whose entire purpose was to bring about those imperial aims. TheRhodes Scholarship programme was the first outcome of Milner’s as yet unnamedsecret society, though at a time when all the funding still came from Rhodes andBeit. Cape MP John X. Merriman, by no means an uncritical admirer of Rhodes, andprobably the most objective observer of the man, had his own strong suspicions:‘Rhodes left the residue of his vast estate for political purposes un-named. Itis no doubt an attempt to realize some of Rhodes’s crazy meanderings to Steadabout an order of millionaires on the basis of the Jesuits.’In a note to Hawksley, after the drafting of his last will, Rhodes statedunequivocally that he wanted the best of his Rhodes Scholars spread around theglobe to ‘maintain the Imperial thought’. And so, with Milner’s appointment ofParkin as organising secretary of the Rhodes Trust in 1902, there can be littledoubt that the Rhodes Secret Society had seamlessly moved on under Milner, whowas now its chief executive. Quigley astutely observes that ‘When Rhodes spoketo Stead in 1895 about the scholarships at Oxford, he did not abandon thesociety but continued to speak of it as the real power behind the scholarships.’Milner slowly implemented changes. There were no instant executions – though hedid cut all communication with Stead. Also, with the expanding hegemony manyolder members, such as Jameson, either took less active roles or assumeddifferent roles. Alfred Beit and Abe Bailey both invested huge chunks of theirfortunes in trusts supporting the new core activities of the Society, thoughtheir roles were also diminished.Jameson, who had already begun to shift allegiance to Milner in the last year ofRhodes’s life, led the Progressive Party to victory in the Cape, where he servedas prime minister from 1904 to 1908. Important Afrikaners like Jan Smuts werebrought in to the secret circle, and would in the future sit at Milner’s side.Jameson was made a baronet in 1911, thereby putting to an end any lingeringdoubts about where British sympathies for the raid really lay. By then, however,the Secret Society had already grown into a massive organisation spanning theworld.* * *After Rhodes’s burial in Rhodesia, Milner’s first task was to bring the Boer Warto an end. Boer generals like Jan Smuts decided they did not want to see theirpeople living the lives of hill bandits and, however reluctantly, they came tothe peace table. Milner himself had hastily sailed for England in November 1898,and by the time he returned to the Cape in February 1899 he was fully assured ofChamberlain’s support for draconian measures against the Boers. Milner wouldhave informed Chamberlain too that Rhodes was deteriorating, that Stead nolonger had control of the Rhodes millions, and that significant Society memberssuch as Jameson were coming over to his side.When the war was nearly won, Milner wrote to Chamberlain: ‘Bring out Britishsettlers through government agencies in considerable numbers’ – which has thering of a Secret Society diktat. He launched schemes to create what amounted toan English-speaking ‘Milner Youth’ in the Boer lands, telling Chamberlain: ‘Nextto the composition of the population, the thing which matters most is itseducation. English should be the dominant language and Boer children should betaught from English books of “the right tone and spirit”. I attach specialimportance to school history books.’ Milner endowed English-speaking grammar anddiocesan schools, known as the Milner Schools, in the Afrikaner heartlands ofthe Transvaal, particularly around Pretoria. These, along with schools likeRondebosch Boys’ High School in the Cape which Rhodes endowed, are still amongthe most prestigious schools in South Africa.Milner hired an imperialist, Edmund Sargant, as his director of education, andthe latter employed only teachers who were prepared to affirm ‘sympathy with theintention of the government to make the Orange River and Transvaal coloniespermanently part of the British dominions’. During job interviews applicantswere asked: ‘Will you use your best endeavours to reconcile all the Boer men,women and children … to their new position as citizens of the British Empire?’Milner remained loyal and true to everything Rhodes believed in, particularlyhis aim of making southern Africa ‘one dominion’. He confidently proclaimed: ‘Athoroughly British Transvaal will draw all South Africa after it … Every newrailway, every new school, every new settlement is a nail in the coffin of Boernationalism.’ The legislative councils of both the Orange Free State andTransvaal were presided over by two former associates of Rhodes who would almostcertainly have been initiated into the Secret Society: the aforementioned PercyFitzPatrick and his friend George Farrar from the Chamber of Mines. They hadboth supported Rhodes in the Jameson Raid and both were knighted.Milner had become something of a mandarin of Empire. Seeming to feel it was hislot to be unpopular, and increasingly so, he sensed that his position as highcommissioner was threatened: ‘My accumulated unpopularity must ultimately leadto a change,’ he wrote to his family in England. ‘The whole question is, at whatpace the unpopularity accumulates.’ He was still in intimate contact with theburgeoning British Secret Society, as is clear from Brett’s Journals, where,dating from 1891, there are no fewer than ten entries relating to Milner.Addressing Rosebery, Brett says: ‘I want you to see Alfred Milner who just nowis here [Hôtel des Deux Mondes, Paris] then he returns to London. Such acharming fellow, with a “culte” [a feeling of worship] for you. Will youconsent?’ As we already know, Brett himself had a culte for Archie Primrose,Lord Rosebery.A later entry in 1897 is revealing, not only concerning the state of Rhodes’shealth but also about Brett’s relationship with Milner, who was just settling into his job as high commissioner for South Africa: ‘I came up with Milner fromWindsor this morning. He has a heavy job; and has to start de novo. TheCommittee [into the Jameson Raid] will leave few of the old gang on their legs.Alas! Rhodes was a pitiful object. Harcourt very sorry for him.’ Milner in turnwrote to Brett, expressing anxiety but also eagerness about his appointment: ‘SoI will believe in the thing when I land at Cape Town. But I hope there will beno slip, for, though I know perfectly well that I may break my neck over it, Iam wild to go.’It was not long before his ‘accumulated unpopularity’ led to the change Milnerhad anticipated. This suited him, and it certainly suited the Boers. Theirresentment had turned into bitter hatred, as the poet Eugène Marais observed:‘We hate these people from the bottom of our hearts because they have besmirchedour honourable name. It is not possible to forgive and even less forget.’Throughout this period Milner remains something of an enigma.A prominent gossip of the time, Sir T.E. Fuller, mentions Milner only once inhis Cecil Rhodes: A Monograph and Reminiscence, and that only in relation to acomment Milner made about Edmund Garrett, former editor of the Pall Mall Gazettewho now edited Rhodes’s newspaper the Cape Times. Garrett was a great favouriteof Milner’s as indeed he was of Rhodes. ‘He is good to look at,’ is what Milnerallegedly said of Garrett, though it is more likely that this hints at Rhodes’sown feelings for Garrett.Still, the gossip about Milner’s sexual predilections persisted, despite hismany female relationships with women such as the actress Catherine Duval and thewriter Elinor Glyn. He also had a twenty-year friendship with Lady VioletGeorgina Gascoyne-Cecil, whom he married just four years before his death.Margot Tennant, later accused in court of having lesbian relationships, seems tohave enjoyed a somewhat ambivalent affair with Milner, entering into whatQuigley describes as an ‘all too brief romantic interlude’ with him during hisperiod as undersecretary of finance in Egypt. Milner’s liaison with youngMargot, whom he first met at a Balliol dinner, was not nearly as brief asQuigley suggests, however. Quite clearly, Milner was not that shy, though hedoes seem to have had a somewhat odd attitude to women.The socially adept Margot had a sharp wit and even sharper claws, and was,together with her sister Laura, a leading light in a group known as The Souls.7[part0037.html#ch19fn-7] According to Quigley, The Souls ‘flitted about from onegreat country house to another or from one spectacular social event to anotherin the town houses of their elders’. This group of sexually adventurousaristocrats included several individuals already mentioned in this account. Therelevance of this is that The Souls and many similar groups, including theCliveden Set, have come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, followingsuggestions that a cadre of aesthetes, homosexual, bisexual and lesbiansocialites dominated British society and politics in the first third of thetwentieth century. Later, in 1918, when Milner was at the height of his powerand influence and a member of the war cabinet, Margot – by then the wife ofPrime Minister Herbert Asquith – was publicly attacked by a member ofParliament, Noel Pemberton Billing, who claimed that the nation’s war effort wasbeing undermined by homosexuals in high places. Billing hinted that MargotAsquith herself was part of this homosexual clique.Billing was himself something of a national hero. After serving in the Boer Warhe went back to England, founded the company that produced the Spitfire fighterplane, was elected a member of Parliament, and then launched a politicalcampaign and a magazine, The Imperialist, whose name was later changed to TheVigilante. Germany, he claimed, had infiltrated and tainted English society byblackmailing ‘47,000 highly placed British perverts’ – one of whom, he hinted,was Margot Asquith.8 [part0037.html#ch19fn-8]However, to return to 1891: following the Balliol dinner, Milner arranged asubsequent meeting with Margot in Reading, deciding soon afterwards that he hadfallen in love with her. But there was little time to pursue his suit, and so hetravelled to Peeblesshire in Scotland where he hatched a plot with Margot’smother. The family would visit him in Egypt. He had one last dinner with Margotat the House of Commons then returned to Cairo. Margot arrived with her familyin October, and together they set off to see the sights of Egypt. Therelationship between Margot and Milner apparently deepened, but Margot was notimpressed by the antiquities, and even less by the flies, the heat and thesqualor; she was homesick for the cool English countryside. When Milner took heron a trip to the Pyramids, where he proposed marriage, she turned him down andwent home to marry Herbert Asquith, a widower with five children.Milner took his rejection well, observing drily to his friend, Philip LytteltonGell: ‘No bones broken. I have not been eaten by an ogress.’ Nevertheless, heapparently decided that at thirty-seven he had left marriage rather too late,and got down to what he did best: work. Many years later, his marriage to LadyViolet Cecil at the age of sixty-nine seemed a marriage of convenience. Still,the couple had in fact enjoyed a personal and political liaison for over twentyyears. Violet Cecil was a woman to be reckoned with, particularly in thosechauvinistic times. Indeed, she had her own close journalistic connections withMilner’s two other great loves, the Empire and Rhodes.* * *The marriage between Alfred Milner and Violet Cecil was also a conjoining of theideals of the Secret Society. Violet Cecil was the clever daughter of AdmiralFrederick Maxse, and her brother, General Sir Ivor Maxse, was, according toQuigley, ‘a good friend of Milner’s, and married to Mary Caroline Wyndham,daughter of Baron Leconfield and niece of Lord Rosebery’.Leopold, Violet Cecil’s second brother – who, before her, had edited theprestigious National Review – is listed among the prominent members of a diningclub named the Coefficients, which Milner likewise joined when it was founded in1902 by members of the Fabian Society. The club was a monthly forum for Britishsocialist reformers in the Ruskin mould. Its members included at least five menwho had been initiates of Rhodes’s Society of Friends, or the Society of theElect: Leopold Amery; Liberal politician, lawyer and philosopher Richard BurdonHaldane; James Louis Garvin, newspaper editor; Edward Grey, éminence grise ofBritish politics; and Sir Henry Birchenough, imperial civil servant.Violet Cecil’s first husband was Lord Edward Cecil, son of the British primeminister Lord Salisbury. A career soldier, Edward Cecil fought in both the BoerWar and the First World War, and died on active service in 1918. Violet Cecilexchanged letters with Lord Milner throughout his time in South Africa and was aregular guest at Rhodes’s table at Groote Schuur – and when Rhodes died it wasshe who had angrily pointed a finger at Catherine Radziwill, saying it was ‘thatwoman’ who had killed him. In 1901 Violet Cecil established the Victorian Leagueto promote Milner’s imperial vision, an act that hints at the deep and abidingdevotion, both personal and political, that existed between them.Not a single act of impropriety stains Milner’s personal record – though on apolitical level he was never, as the Boers discovered, anything less thanruthless. Milner’s main interest was work. He put in many long hours with anenthusiasm that verged on zealotry. Inheriting Rhodes’s vast fortune apparentlymade no material difference to the way he lived his life.Rhodes had been astute in choosing the wily Milner to carry the torch. Whilethere is a miasma of intrigue here, the sequence of events concerning Milner’sappointment as high commissioner to South Africa is clear and telling: Stead andBrett definitely had a hand in the matter, but the appointment only occurredafter Chamberlain had learnt from Brett that Rhodes had the powerful backing ofa secret society of which Brett himself was a core member.There were others in these shadowlands who would surely have been aware ofMilner’s hidden political aims. If Chamberlain knew, then Rosebery must haveknown – indeed, Rosebery’s ties to the Secret Society are far clearer today thanthey were in those murky times. A series of letters and speeches have come tolight which indicate with little equivocation Rosebery’s involvement in theJameson Raid.These begin with Rosebery confiding to Lord Ripon that he himself had supportedthe raid, and cited his reasons: ‘We could not be unconcerned if Britishsettlers [Uitlanders] should be shot down in conflicts caused by a persistentdenial of their human rights.’ Soon after the raid, Rosebery told his closefriend and Eton contemporary Edward Hamilton (then secretary to the Treasury)that he was worried about the damage the raid could do to the government becausehe had ‘the best reason to believe that there was truth in the rumours that inthe Transvaal business, culminating in the raid, Chamberlain’s hands were notclean’.Furthermore, Rhodes had gone straight to Rosebery’s country house, Mentmore,when he arrived in England in 1895 to be made a privy councillor. Rhodes wasespecially pleased by the appointment, as he viewed the Privy Council, whichincluded many colonial heads of state, as a model for his own imperialfederation. And it was at Mentmore, Rosebery’s biographer Leo McKinstry claims,that Rhodes gave Rosebery an outline of his plan to support an Uitlanderuprising in Johannesburg. McKinstry adds: ‘Rhodes said later, that he felt itonly fair to give this information in case it might affect his decision toappoint him to the Privy Council. Apparently Rosebery allayed his fears on thescore: “Oh that’s alright, I’m a bit of a filibuster9 [part0037.html#ch19fn-9]myself.”’According to his close friend Hans Sauer, Rhodes later used this information –in particular the filibuster comment – as blackmail, which ensured that Rhodeslargely survived the Committee of Inquiry into the Jameson Raid: ‘We also have acat in the bag which let out would show that one of their big men knew all aboutit. The big man in question, Rhodes said, was Rosebery.’ Indeed, McKinstryclaims that ‘Rosebery was the statesman Rhodes most admired’.In light of the above, it is reasonable to suggest that Rosebery was a de factomember of the Secret Society even if his instincts for avoiding the tedium ofcommitment precluded him from formalising this relationship. Small wonder, then,that the tortuous trial of Rhodes was described by W.T. Stead as ‘The WorshipfulCompany of Whitewashers’, but that after Rosebery’s career petered out at theturn of the century, he soon popped up again – as chairman of the newly formedRhodes Trust!From this time on, the British government effectively became an Association ofHelpers for the Secret Society, with Milner and Brett operating as a gingergroup for matters imperial. Ten years hence that group would have a name, andten years later still, while continuing to operate as a secret society, therewould be one significant change: the unelected Milner would still be controllingthings while working hand in glove with the prime minister, David Lloyd George."},{"pageContent":"20ImmortalityThe year before Rhodes passed away, Queen Victoria had died. In 1901 Edward VIIwas left sitting nervously on the throne, surrounded by warring politicalfactions – Liberals, Liberal Conservatives, Gladstonian Liberals, Unionists,Conservative Unionists, Free Traders, Home Rulers, and more!Edward had initially been confused by all this politics. Dominated by animperious mother who regarded his libertine ways as the cause of his fatherAlbert’s death, Edward had sought solace in the life of a playboy. It isestimated that, during the course of his life, he had fifty-five sexualliaisons; several women – among them Alice Keppel and Daisy Greville, Countessof Warwick – were, quite openly, Edward’s mistresses.Moreover, Edward, so far as we know, had not realised that Daisy Greville was aspy for W.T. Stead. She was among a league of intelligent socialites likeCatherine Radziwill whom Stead conscripted to collect hot copy – often hot fromthe pillow. It is even possible that, like Flora Shaw of The Times, DaisyGreville was among the rare female initiates in the ever-evolving SecretSociety. She recorded that after a talk with Stead she knew ‘everything’ and hadagreed to become ‘a silent worker for the cause’ – an admission that puts her inthe secret Association of Helpers, at the very least. The ‘cause’ was, as shedescribed it, a ‘reunion and reconciliation of the English-speaking universe soas to improve the world’; in this, there are distinct echoes of Rhodes’sConfession of Faith. Like Regy Brett, Daisy Greville spent much time with theKing, who may well have been a Secret Society sympathiser.The new King inherited the government of Lord Salisbury who, at sixty-five, wasill and too old for the job. The new monarch had favoured his predecessor ArchiePrimrose, Lord Rosebery, whose honour he had defended when the latter wasaccused of sodomising the eldest son of the Marquess of Queensberry, for thejob. But Rosebery, who disliked the hard grind of governance, had in any caseretired from the political arena some years earlier. To make matters worse,Edward found himself stuck with a war in South Africa that seemingly could notbe won. A bunch of Boer sharpshooters had the Empire’s supposedly invinciblearmy pinned down in Africa, and their success – or obduracy – was encouragingBritain’s enemies in Europe, particularly the Germans.Help was at hand, however. King Edward’s mother had been greatly assisted in thelast years of her life by an enigmatic courtier – no one could quite work outwhat exactly he did or how he was paid – whose name was Reginald Baliol Brett.And now this courtier made it his business to gain the confidence of her sontoo. Thus it was, and in one fell swoop – Stead’s fall from grace and Rhodes’sdeath – that Wallace’s notion of ‘four just men’ morphed into a potent pair, asAlfred Milner and Regy Brett became the two best-connected, most adept politicalmanipulators of their age.As executor of Rhodes’s will, Milner had access to all Rhodes’s money. And ashigh commissioner he occupied a position at the heart of the action – and withcontrol over the Anglo-Boer War. Moreover, he could count on the support of thenow immensely powerful Secret Society. Brett, similarly backed, had the ear notonly of the King but also of the foreign secretary Joseph Chamberlain. EvenWinston Churchill wrote admiringly of Chamberlain’s political clout at thistime, describing him as the man ‘who made the weather’.* * *Milner and Brett kept to the Secret Society’s political agenda, though theythrew away most of the trappings, lifting the blanket of secrecy at the sametime. None of the oaths, no secret signs, no draconian disciplines modelled onthe Jesuits survived. These were replaced by a structure comprised of layers,with the top one being transparent and open to public scrutiny. From this timeon, Milner and Brett in particular ceased to regard the evolved entity that wasemerging as totally secret – though at its actual core the new cabal was no lesssecretive than before. It would, however, be infinitely more powerful.The top layer of the structure was the newly established Rhodes Trust. Its taskwas largely to administer a transparent and prestigious scholarship programme atOxford, Rhodes’s alma mater, endowed from his gold and diamond fortune. Designedto provide immortality for Rhodes, this public programme – the RhodesScholarship programme – which had been created by Rhodes, Stead, Brett andMilner, as well as a few moneyed supporters like Abe Bailey and Alfred Beit,could obviously not be clandestine.Down the years, many thousands of words have been written about the RhodesScholarship programme and the great men it has educated – as indeed it continuesto do. It has its own grand building in South Parks Road, Oxford, designed bySir Herbert Baker, architect of Groote Schuur. Rhodes House has a huge meetinghall, and it houses important libraries as well as the offices of the RhodesTrust. The letterhead of the Rhodes Trust is the Zimbabwe bird – a copy of theicon that Willie Posselt had stolen from Great Zimbabwe to decorate GrooteSchuur.Alfred Milner built the trust, and after his unpopularity caught up with him inSouth Africa, he went back to England in 1905, where he retired from publiclife. Once again, Milner’s timing was immaculate. The Boer War had finally endedin an ignoble Boer surrender, and the English public was riding a tsunami ofpatriotic feeling. The heroes of the hour had all been Rhodes’s cronies:Kipling, who had immortalised the khaki-clad British Tommy; Lord Kitchener, whohad bludgeoned the Boers into submission; and Alfred Milner, who somehow got thecredit as the peace negotiator.In much the same way as Rhodes had returned to a hero’s welcome after theoccupation of Mashonaland, Milner now returned to enthusiastic public acclaim.On the very day he disembarked he had an audience with King Edward VII, was madea Knight Commander of the British Empire and privy councillor, and was raised tothe peerage as ‘Baron Milner of St James’s in the County of London and of CapeTown in the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope’. The next day he spoke at aluncheon given in his honour, and afterwards, answering journalists who askedwhether, with more time and patience, the war might not have been averted,Milner shot back by suggesting it was impossible to ‘conciliate’ with Boer‘panoplied hatred, insensate ambition, and invincible ignorance’.John Bull decided that Milner had saved the Empire, and henceforth he could dono wrong. He set to work refining the Rhodes Scholarships into a programme whichprovided young men from the colonies and ex-colonies with the necessaryeducation to run Milner’s English-speaking and English-dominated Empire. Therewere also scholarships for Germans. Rhodes had visited Kaiser Wilhelm the yearbefore, and the Kaiser had so admired Rhodes that he agreed to have Englishtaught as a second language in German schools! Which fits, albeit ironically,with the original Secret Society ambition to build a global hegemony so powerfulthat war would no longer exist, and where English was the ‘winning ticket’.The idea of the scholarships did not in fact originate with Rhodes, or indeedStead. Rhodes lifted it almost entirely from a journalist friend of theirs, J.Astley Cooper, who edited a jingoistic weekly called Greater Britain – its titlesomewhat oddly, perhaps, identical to that of the newspaper Catherine Radziwillhad produced in Cape Town. In both his weekly and in a letter to The TimesAstley Cooper wrote: ‘I suggest the foundation of national or imperialscholarships. There are none in existence yet.’ Setting up such scholarshipsthroughout the Empire would ‘increase the goodwill and understanding of theEmpire’. Stead, who records that he was consulted on the idea, suggested theinclusion of a few Americans also – which of course accommodated essentialelements of the Confession of Faith. Cooper had also suggested that athleticprowess be a factor in the choice of candidates as ‘the future relationship ofthe various portions of the Empire rests chiefly in the hands of the young menof the Empire’ – an idea that had obviously appealed to Rhodes.What emerged from it all was a modernised and better-run version of the SecretSociety, though it deviated not an iota from the key elements of Rhodes’s grandplan as outlined in the Confession of Faith. The mood of the nation masked thefact that, unlike similar scholarships such as the Carnegie Trust, the RhodesScholarship programme had a political purpose: with the assistance of Rhodes’sfirst lieutenant, Milner, the programme was still being directed from the grave.This is confirmed by one of Rhodes’s most intimate friends and undoubtedly amember of the Society’s inner circle in South Africa, Edmund Garrett. This isthe same intimate who used to announce his presence at Groote Schuur by throwingpebbles at Rhodes’s window, and who, in an obituary in the Contemporary Reviewof 1902, asserted: ‘That idea of a sort of Jesuit-like Secret Society for thePromotion of the Empire, which for long he hugged and which – minus perhaps thesecrecy and the Jesuitry – I know to have had a good deal of fascination forothers among our contemporaries.’ This strongly implies that the Rhodes SecretSociety was carried whole by Milner into the twentieth century, where a new teamtook it further to the future.Milner’s first job after Rhodes’s death was the creation of the Rhodes Trust toimplement the Rhodes Scholarship programme. At the same time, Milner wasrebuilding South Africa as an anglicised state, and ensuring that the SecretSociety was a working entity. He did this by appointing George Parkin as itstravelling ambassador, and by training the aforementioned elite secretariatknown as the Milner Kindergarten.The criteria for Rhodes Scholarship candidates had also been redefined. An award‘should not only be for literary attainments but also … [for] character andsocial qualities … especially being fond of field sports say cricket andfootball,’ with Rhodes insisting, ‘I do not want simply bookworms.’ He added apolitical codicil: a Rhodes Scholarship was for ‘instilling into their minds theadvantages of the colonies as well as to England for the retention of the Unityof the Empire’. To give Rhodes his due, he also specified that no student shouldbe disqualified on account of religion or race. Women were originally excluded,although the relevant clause was later amended by the Rhodes Trust.Today, the Rhodes Trust website reads as follows: ‘The Rhodes Scholarshipselection committees will be seeking young women and men of outstandingintellect, character, leadership, and commitment to service. The RhodesScholarships support students who demonstrate qualities likely to result intheir becoming “leaders for the world’s future”.’ It further claims that ‘theRhodes’ is the oldest and most prestigious international scholarship programmein the world, as it undoubtedly is. Rhodes is today widely regarded as havinghad feet of clay, yet his legacy is rock solid, and those who benefit from itare – however slightly – moulded in his image. Rhodes’s ‘leaders for the world’sfuture’ have, over the decades, exerted huge influence on our world, as willbecome clear in the pages that follow.* * *When Milner returned to England in 1905 he joined the ranks of the greatEmpire-builders – Clive of India, Gordon of Khartoum, Kitchener of the Nile, andseveral other men of their ilk. And, furthermore, Milner had every intention ofleading ‘the world’s future’. However, not long after his triumphant return,Milner reverted to being simply Alfred Milner and all but vanished from publicview. No one seemed to notice, or to care, that the Rhodes Trust and its glossyscholarship programme was just the tip of an iceberg of influence. The fullspread of this influence only became apparent when the Rhodes Trust met for thefirst time in London. That very first meeting was held in May 1902 at the homeof the former Liberal prime minister Lord Rosebery, who had taken Milner’s placeas senior trustee – this because Milner was otherwise occupied at the post-warpeace conference in Vereeniging.Rosebery comfortably presided over a meeting where the following familiar faceswere present: Jameson, now head of the Progressive Party in South Africa andsoon-to-be prime minister of the Cape; Earl Grey, the British South AfricaCompany director now serving as administrator of Rhodesia; Alfred Beit, Rhodes’sfriend and financier; Sir Lewis Michell, Rhodes’s banker; and Bouchier Hawksley,his lawyer. This was still very much the Secret Society of old. The onlysignificant names missing from the group are those of Regy Brett and theallegedly disloyal W.T. Stead. Brett generally remained undercover to ensure thecontinuance of the uniquely clandestine relationship he enjoyed with Britishmonarchs. Nevertheless, he managed to remain active in the evolved Society andalso to maintain his loyalty to Milner.Now that Rhodes was dead, W.T. Stead makes a surprise return to the scene,suggesting that his split with Milner was not quite as absolute as has beensuggested. It is as well to recall that as late as 1898, Rhodes was still givingStead orders, instructing him to stand by Milner: ‘Always trust Milner. Youdon’t know what you have got in him.’ And later, knowing Stead’s opposition tothe Boer War was absolute: ‘You support Milner in any measure that he may takeshort of war. I make no such limitation. I support Milner absolutely withoutreserve. If he says peace, I say peace; if he says war, I say war. Whateverhappens I say ditto to Milner.’It is clear that Stead continued to enjoy a close relationship with the RhodesTrust – even going so far as to try, with two of its clerical staff, to reachRhodes in the hereafter. He had taken two of the secretaries from the trust to aseance where a medium apparently announced – on behalf of the dead Rhodes – thatRhodes’s one regret was that he had not followed the advice of his greatestfriend, Stead! Unsurprisingly, Stead penned the first ‘biography’ of Rhodes,titled:THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF CECIL JOHN RHODES WITH ELUCIDATORY NOTES TO WHICHARE ADDED SOME CHAPTERS DESCRIBING THE POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS IDEAS OF THETESTATOREdited by W.T. STEADThis 215-page book was opportunistically published in 1902 by Stead’s own Reviewof Reviews Press, and its ‘elucidatory notes’ contained, needless to say, muchmaterial lauding Stead himself. By the time the book was published, the firstRhodes Scholarships – including tuition at Oxford for one to three years, fullboard and lodging, and a travel allowance to and from the furthest reaches ofEmpire – were already in place, and from there the trust developed into a treewhose branches span the globe.* * *In 1902 Alfred Milner had the world at his feet: favoured by the King, he wouldremain thus the entire period Regy Brett was the court whisperer – from the timeof Edward VII to George V, Milner was already a viscount, and could easily havechosen any government position he desired. He had access to all of Rhodes’smoney, with no interest in spending it on himself or a family. And there wereother fortunes too – those of Beit and Bailey – which he could dispose of as hewished. He enjoyed the absolute support of the British foreign secretary, theprime minister, the former prime minister, as well as a vast circle ofinfluential and wealthy friends, most bonded to him in one form or other,including through the mutating Secret Society.In South Africa, Milner’s rule over the Boers was absolute, and he had begun hisassault on their nascent national identity. Having secretly trained hisKindergarten, he sent them back to England to manage the Secret Society’smetamorphosis into an organisation which he hoped would realise Rhodes’s dreamson the international stage.And then, seemingly out of the blue and after wintering with Milner in SouthAfrica in 1902–03, the foreign secretary, Joseph Chamberlain, put his career onthe line: he launched a ferocious political campaign to promote colonial tariffpreferences, a scheme that would make the products of the self-governingcolonies of the Empire cheaper than imports from other countries. Known asimperial preferences, the scheme reached out across the world, seeking to givethe lands of the Empire most-favoured status. It was an idea obviously favouredby the Secret Society.But events were to follow which left Alfred Milner with a lifelong contempt forpoliticians. He never fully believed in democratic government again, apparentlydeciding that a dedicated, hand-picked and trained elite were far betterequipped to run a country’s affairs. Indeed, Milner may even have triggered,however inadvertently, the ensuing events, which would eventually costChamberlain and Prime Minister Balfour their jobs.Things came to a head in 1903, when Chamberlain and the issue of imperialpreferences were challenged in Parliament. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, C.T.Ritchie, supported the free trade ideas of leading economists of the time, andwas vigorously opposed to any preferential import scheme.Balfour, who headed the shaky Conservative-Unionist coalition government, losthis nerve. He had previously promised Chamberlain full support for his campaignbut, faced with the Ritchie putsch, he switched sides. It was not onlyChamberlain who felt betrayed, but also the Secret Society. There was talk ofcalling back Rosebery, but Rosebery would have none of it. His last stint asprime minister had been extremely stressful, with the result that he now hadchronic insomnia. Chamberlain’s sense of betrayal was compounded by the factthat the year before, at the Colonial Conference, Canada had given imperialpreferences its outright support. But Balfour’s position remained ambivalent,and that September Chamberlain broke with Balfour and committed himself to runalone for imperial preferences.The entire episode may well have been a bloodless coup attempt on the part ofthe Secret Society, hoping to gain control of the British government. Whateverthe case, there is one indisputable fact: Chamberlain had Milner’s support, andthe timing suggests that he may have decided, after talks with Milner (i.e. theSecret Society) in South Africa, to risk his political future by going it aloneon the issue of imperial preferences.All summer long, Balfour had stalled the imperial preference debate – until, on9 September, Chamberlain’s letter of resignation arrived. While at firstagreeing to keep the letter secret, Balfour then attempted a devious manoeuvrethat would have seen Chamberlain’s son, Austen, elected to the cabinet in placeof Ritchie. Austen could then lobby for his father’s imperial tariff policy andChamberlain’s eventual return to government. This, however, led to a welter ofresignations as the free traders locked horns with the imperial preferencelobby.With renewed energy, Chamberlain threw himself into his campaign. He addressedvast crowds across the length and breadth of the country, extolling the virtuesof imperial preference and suggesting that Ritchie’s free trade policiesthreatened British industry. He hit the headlines, and his ideas received muchsupport from the press. So hard did he campaign that his health began to failand he was forced to take a two-month holiday in February 1904. By then theacrimony had become intense, with the two sides virtually irreconcilable.Deciding that the government was irreparably split, Balfour resigned in November1905. In what was surely more than mere coincidence, Milner promptly resignedhis position in South Africa and hurried back to England. His return wasundeniably linked to deep concerns about the state of British politics and thefuture of the Empire.Following Balfour’s resignation, the Liberals took over. They were led by arelatively unknown friend of Rosebery’s, Henry Campbell-Bannerman. However, hishealth also collapsed, and Campbell-Bannerman died just nineteen days afterresigning in 1908 in favour of Herbert Asquith. Chamberlain’s own ill healthpersisted, and in 1906 he suffered a disabling stroke. All this was bad news forMilner and the Secret Society, and seemed to represent its first failed ventureinto imperial politics. Though embittered, the stoic Milner soldiered on.On the surface, Milner showed little or no concern for the rise and fall in thefortunes of Chamberlain. Milner apparently had come home to early retirement andto rest on well-earned laurels. His only duties were running the Rhodes Trustand the scholarship programme for his late friend Cecil Rhodes, both of which hemanaged admirably. He also took on several directorships, and in 1906 wasappointed director of the Joint Stock Bank and also of the Rio Tinto MiningGroup. The banking job, arranged by Nathan Rothschild, was Milner’sapprenticeship into the massively wealthy world of finance, particularly Jewishfinance, where he would continue to be active.* * *To determine the extent of Milner’s continued clandestine involvement duringthis period, it is necessary, however, to revisit that fateful year of 1902.Joseph Chamberlain, as foreign secretary, had, somewhat surprisingly, agreed toa meeting with a certain Theodor Herzl, a pioneer Zionist who was at the timetouring Europe. Herzl’s quest was to establish a Jewish state, and for years hehad organised meetings of the Zionist Congress and met with Jewish millionaires.Among these were the Rothschilds, one of whom – presumably unbeknown to Herzl –had, along with Alfred Milner, just been made executor of Rhodes’s latest will.Despite his persistence, Herzl’s efforts so far were singularly unsuccessful. Itwas at a meeting in April – while Milner was in London collecting his peerage –that Foreign Secretary Chamberlain, in an apparently surprise gesture, offeredHerzl the territory of Uganda as a Jewish homeland!This bizarre, long-forgotten moment in British colonial history gains freshsignificance when it is considered in the context of the Secret Society, whichwas vitally interested in north-central Africa. Together with Kenya, this wasterritory that Rhodes required for his Cape to Cairo railway; it was also partof the terra incognita that he had commissioned Little Johnston to explore – andwhere the latter had already laid out the rail-link directly south of Uganda.Uganda at this time was at the heart of the ‘scramble’ for the central part ofAfrica. The French wanted it because they thought it would give them control ofthe headwaters of the Nile – and thus of ‘British’ Egypt. The Germans were inTanganyika, just a march away from the Great Lakes region. When the offer to theZionists was not taken up, Britain began to build the ‘Lunatic Line’ from Kenyato Uganda with the purpose of moving troops efficiently to central Africa wherethe Great Lakes, believed to be the source of the Nile, were attracting so muchattention. For the Secret Society, the Uganda plan would have been an idealsolution: a grateful ‘Zion’ in central Africa, dependent on the likes of NathanRothschild, and with Rhodes’s railway running all the way down Africa.From a contemporary perspective it seems inconceivable that cool, secretiveAlfred Milner was involved in a scheme this lunatic, which envisaged theequivalent of today’s state of Israel helping to steer the Secret Society’simperial plan. Yet Milner never gave up on it. Exactly a decade after theinitiative to establish a homeland for the Jews, and long after Uganda had beenforgotten, Arthur Balfour made the following declaration: ‘His Majesty’sgovernment view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national homefor the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate theachievement of this object.’As we now know, this ‘Balfour’ Declaration, which effectively created the stateof Israel – putting Balfour in the ambit of the Secret Society – was in factwritten by Alfred Milner. Ever loyal to the Rothschilds, Milner had apparentlynever stopped searching for a site for the Jewish homeland, or for land to buildthe railway line to Cairo. And all the while he kept his Rothschild contactswarm – the London venue for the first meeting of the Rhodes Trust was, ofcourse, the palatial mansion leased by Lord Rosebery, who was by then wedded tofabulously wealthy Hannah Rothschild.* * *Viscount Milner was in fact appalled at the infighting surrounding the demise ofthe Balfour government and the controversy around Chamberlain’s attempt to bondthe Empire with preferential tariffs. He now saw his job as the protection ofEngland and the Empire – if necessary from its own rotten governments. In 1902,writing to an old friend, Sir Clinton Dawkins, Milner declared: ‘Two thingsconstantly strike me. One the soundness of the British nation as a whole,contrasting with the rottenness of political parties.’ That same year herepeated this to George Parkin, his imperial emissary: ‘I am strongly impressedby two things; one that the heart of the nation is sound, and secondly that ourconstitution and methods are antiquated and bad.’ Two years later he declared toSir Lewis Michell: ‘Representative government has its merits, no doubt, but theinfluence of representative assemblies organised on the party system, uponadministrations – “government” in the true sense of the word – is almostuniversally bad.’Milner had clearly had enough of democracy. He set out to discover whether theworld, particularly his beloved Empire, might not be better served by anautocracy, though one that respected certain liberal ideals. The solution wasrule by his Secret Society, itself supported by a clandestine cadre ofaesthetically inclined and intellectually able civil servants recruited in themain from All Souls College – an outstanding group of men all trained in his ownimage!"},{"pageContent":"21The KindergartenIt is no small irony that almost the first recruit to Milner’s Kindergarten wasJohn Buchan, bestselling author of spy thrillers like The Thirty-Nine Steps,which featured secret agents, secret societies up to no good, and mysteriousmasterminds attempting to control the world as they all played the Great Game.Buchan’s first novel, Prester John, featured a secret society which attempted tooverthrow the rule of law in South Africa, where Buchan himself served for awhile as Milner’s personal private secretary. The term ‘Kindergarten’ had beenused to describe loyal young recruits like Buchan. Having been trained andtested in minor civil service jobs in South Africa, Milner then sent them backto England where they oversaw the evolving Secret Society while keenlyanticipating illustrious careers.John Buchan is an excellent example of the type. Having served hisapprenticeship with Milner, he rose through the ranks of the colonial civilservice and ended up governor general of Canada. Acclaimed author he may havebeen – The Thirty-Nine Steps has never been out of print – but first andforemost he was a Milner proconsul and a star pupil of the Kindergarten. Atfirst, Milner’s critics used the term sarcastically, but later on they used itsomewhat fearfully. Kindergarteners were known for their loyalty. They neverbroke ranks, and with few exceptions they remained dyed-in-the-woolimperialists. Milner’s character calls were similar to those of Rhodes – andloyalty was all.Milner began to train the Kindergarten at around the turn of the nineteenthcentury, when Rhodes was noticeably ageing and Milner himself had been nominatedas Rhodes’s executive heir. All mention of a secret society had been droppedfrom the last two wills, and the Rhodes Trust and the Rhodes Scholarships becamethe public face of the Secret Society. It was at this point that Milner began totransform the Society, eventually rebranding it and renaming it.Close scrutiny of the Kindergarten and the Rhodes Scholarship programme revealsthat the former was designed to produce clones of Milner, and the latter toproduce clones of Rhodes. Both programmes proved a huge success, and in theseveral years before the new Secret Society was ready they each producedprecisely what Milner needed: the Kindergarten cultivated a steady flow ofsuperb single-minded administrators, and the Rhodes Scholarship programmeprovided a stream of well-educated English-speakers equipped to run the Empirethat Milner had in mind.The Kindergarten was a true elite, hand-picked by Milner largely from Oxford’smost learned college, All Souls. Patrick Duncan, later Sir Patrick, and laterstill governor general of South Africa, was an early Kindergarten recruit whodied in 1943. One of his many obituaries read:Duncan became the doyen of this band of brothers, Milner’s young men, who werenicknamed, The Kindergarten, then in the first flush of youthful enthusiasm. Itis a fast aging and dwindling band now; but it has played a part in the Union ofSouth Africa colonies. For forty years and more, so far as the vicissitudes oflife have allowed, it has kept together; and always, while looking up to LordMilner and to his successor in South Africa, the late Lord Selborne, as itspolitical Chief, has revered Patrick Duncan as the Captain of the band.Some intriguing points emerge when one reads between these lines. The firstrelates to the term ‘band of brothers’, which was the phrase Rhodes always usedto describe the young men with whom he had ‘messed’ in Kimberley, and from whosenumbers the first Secret Society was formed. The second point relates to thefact that, some forty years after Rhodes died, this band of brothers was stilloperative, though now as ‘Milner’s Men’. Carroll Quigley has compiled a list ofMilner’s Men1 [part0037.html#ch21fn-1] consisting of the twenty-three mostsuccessful Kindergarten members – all of whom had served a stint in SouthAfrica. The following are especially important to the story of the SecretSociety:Philip Kerr (later Lord Lothian) progressed rapidly through the British civilservice via the Chancellery of the Duchy of Lancaster, and eventually ended upas British ambassador to Washington.Robert Brand (later Lord Brand), close friend of Kerr, came from a line ofpublic servants, started his Kindergarten service in 1902, and subsequently saton numerous diplomatic commissions. A banker, he was instrumental in arrangingenormous loans from Lazards and Lloyds for the purposes of post-warreconstruction, and was deputy chairman of the British Mission in Washington. Hemarried Phyllis Langhorne, sister of Nancy Astor, thereby gaining entry to theCliveden Set – which, as later chapters reveal, played an influential role inthe progress of the Secret Society.Geoffrey Dawson was Milner’s private secretary in South Africa from 1901. He waseditor of the Johannesburg Star, and also editor of The Times for six years,from 1912 to 1918, and again from 1922 to 1941. In the interim period of nigh ontwenty years, he served as a director of Rhodes’s Consolidated Gold Fields Ltd.His obituary in The Times said: ‘To none was Milner’s heart more wholly giventhan to Dawson; the sympathy between the older and the younger man was almostthat of father and son.’Lionel Curtis enjoyed the reputation of being the oracle of the group, havingauthored many erudite works that had massive influence across the Empire. Whenhe finished his stint in South Africa he became interested in India, and, likeGeorge Parkin, he toured the world as a roving ambassador for the SecretSociety. Curtis proposed in 1913 that the name of the British Empire be changedto ‘Commonwealth of Nations’,2 [part0037.html#ch21fn-2] thus signalling afoundational shift in the very identity of the Secret Society.Milner’s Men also included Douglas Orme, William Hitchins, Richard Feetham, JohnDove, Basil Williams, Hugh Wyndham, George F. Fiddes, John Hanbury-Williams,S.O. Walrond, Fabian Ware and William Flavelle Monypenny. A random selectionfrom this list reveals the calibre of the group, its consistent excellence.Richard Feetham became a judge of the Supreme Court in South Africa. JohnHanbury-Williams, who went to South Africa as Milner’s military secretary, waslater chief of the British military mission to Russia (1914–17), serving as amajor general. He was also a marshal in the diplomatic corps, and equerry tothree successive kings of England. William Hitchins served first on commissionsin Rhodesia and India, then as chairman of the giant Cammell Laird shipbuildingcompany, and, together with Brand, established the Canadian munitions industry.And so it goes, like ripples from a pebble thrown in a global pond. Those whohad been Kindergarten-trained in South Africa under either Milner or his chosensuccessor, Lord Selborne, could expect important civil service commissions invarious parts of the Empire, as well as directorships and chairs in importantcompanies and banks, and proconsulships or ambassadorships, as well asprestigious marriage alliances. Wyndham, for example, married Maud Lyttleton,daughter of Viscount Cobham, thus becoming brother-in-law to Sir Ivor Maxse(Lady Milner’s brother) and a relative of Lord Rosebery.* * *Milner’s evolved Secret Society did not change fundamentally. According toQuigley, ‘There was no change in goals.’ Furthermore, ‘There was little changein methods. In fact both of these were modified more by Lord Lothian and hisfriends after Milner’s death than they were by Milner after Rhodes’s death.Rhodes and Milner were aiming at the same goals and had been for twenty-fiveyears.’So when Milner went home, in his view to rescue an ailing England, he had asuperb civil service waiting in the wings, ready and willing to return fromSouth Africa to jobs he had already begun to find for them, and eager to helpform a new Secret Society. What Milner found in England, however, was infinitelyworse than anything he had imagined.The golden age of Edwardianism was in full swing – as indeed was the seeminglyuncontrollable libido of the King. To Milner it seemed that British politicians– drawn mostly from the aristocracy, rich landowners and a growing pool ofindustrial moguls – were aping the dubious morality of the monarch, and doing soopenly. And at the head of it all was that flawed genius, Archie Primrose, LordRosebery, a man incapable of sustaining any kind of commitment, not even to theSecret Society. Archie Primrose dabbled in almost everything but committedhimself to almost nothing.A brilliant orator, Rosebery drove his Liberal colleagues to despair: he refusedto commit to being prime minister when it was perfectly clear that no one elsehad the charisma or requisite qualities for the task. His Rothschild wife Hannahhad brought him a dowry so large that he could buy anything he desired. She alsoput up with anything Archie did – or did not do. Theirs was perhaps the mostsuccessful of the ‘Buccaneer’ Anglo-American marriages, where a ‘landed gent’traded his title for the fortune of an American bride. Though Hannah Rothschildwas ridiculously rich and bright as a button, she was reputed to be ratherplain. Rosebery’s unreliability is well illustrated by the occasion when, atMilner’s urging, he agreed to be chairman of the Imperial Federation League,only to avoid the next two annual general meetings when he realised how muchwork was involved.There were also the much-discussed affairs: Rosebery is alleged to have engagedin long-term correspondence with known pederasts such as William Johnson Coryand Regy Brett. Ahead of the Wilde trials, tongues wagged too about therelationship between Rosebery and Lord Drumlanrig, elder brother of BosieDouglas, Wilde’s boyfriend. Eventually, discretion was thrown to the winds whenan Oxford don, Sir Edmund Backhouse, claimed in his memoir that he had enjoyednights of ‘lingering and protracted copulation’ at Barnbougle Castle, Rosebery’sprivate retreat. McKinstry – Rosebery’s biographer – questions the veracity ofthis claim, pointing out that there is no mention of Backhouse in Rosebery’sdiaries. This omission is not surprising, however: any such mention might haveput the pair alongside Oscar Wilde on the treadmill at Reading Gaol.Brett records in his Journals that Milner confessed his deep concerns not onlyabout the state of the country, but also its politicians: ‘There is somethingunnatural, uncanny and unwholesome in the condition of our party.’ Even theadoring Brett was eventually telling Rosebery to mend his ways and to altercertain of his political attitudes. It is unlikely that a courtier would havebeen in a position to issue such a warning to a prime minister had they not beenpart of a far more intimate and clandestine cadre. Indeed, Brett hints at itsexistence when he warns Rosebery about the importance of ‘aloofness’ as heengages in political battles: ‘If you are going to carry on the fight, it canonly be by conquering first the sympathies of the rank and file of the party andgrouping round you a faithful and intimate group of Praetorians.’ I have fewdoubts who these praetorians might have been.This correspondence had begun many years before Rosebery became openly involvedin the Secret Society – a connection that is evidenced by the fact that hechaired meetings at his London home which Milner, Brett, Jameson and lesserdevotees like Rothschild and Hawksley attended. Rosebery must surely have knownthat these early meetings of the Rhodes Trust were de facto meetings of theSecret Society, not to mention those attended by other associates, one of whomwas the notorious Loulou Harcourt. Brett’s daughter Dorothy had angrily reportedthat Harcourt – her ‘rapist’ – was ‘a sex maniac … as bad with boys as withgirls’. She accused Harcourt of having a voracious sexual appetite: ‘It isn’tthat he is in love. It is just ungovernable Sex desire for both sexes.’3[part0037.html#ch21fn-3] It is a sad fact that Brett made it clear to hisdaughter that she was not to make a fuss as that would cause embarrassment tohis powerful friend.The King himself was an infamous model of licentiousness. Prince Bertie, nowEdward VII, was a philanderer whose pious public face was defended by the pressbaron W.T. Stead – who nevertheless titillated his readers with campaigns likethe child-prostitution scandal, and was himself not averse to flirtations andsexual liaisons.4 [part0037.html#ch21fn-4] Debauchery had, of course, roamed thecorridors of power in previous eras, and would certainly not cease to do soafter Edward’s demise, yet this era was unique for its predatory libertines.The protégés of the pederastic Eton tutor William Johnson Cory includedup-and-coming politicians practising imperial policies. At the very least, thismade them influential associates of Milner’s evolving Secret Society. Foremostamong this group was Charles Wood, Lord Halifax, whose son Edward would becomethe King’s favourite and, arguably, Britain’s most famous politician – aheadeven of Winston Churchill. Then there was Lord Curzon, whose boyhood dalliancewith Oscar Browning – another Eton master and close friend of Cory’s – wasinstrumental in the two masters eventually being ‘let go’ from Eton. Some ofCory’s protégés were members of Chat, a club he formed; they likewise becameactive supporters of the Secret Society, and included three prime ministers,Archie Primrose, Arthur Balfour and Herbert Asquith. Other members were HenryScott Holland, a professor of Oxford, Howard Overing Sturgis, a friend of FrankHarris’s, John Verschoyle, and Reginald Brett, all long-term devotees of Cory.For all their moral dubiousness, these men went on to become the elite thinkersof Britain, academics or politicians of immense power and influence. LordCurzon, who eventually made two lucrative Buccaneer marriages (and had an affairwith Elinor Glyn) was made viceroy of India, joined the war cabinet with Milnerin Lloyd George’s government, and served on the Imperial War Committeecontrolled by Maurice Hankey.At the turn of the century, Milner, who was a good deal more moral than most,tried to combat what he saw as the negative political situation by attempting tostimulate Rosebery’s fading career. Milner reminded his friend of his commitmentto imperialism and of their shared Ruskinian radicalism. Rosebery rallied, andwent on to make the following fervent declaration in 1895:If a Liberal Imperialist means that I am a Liberal who is passionately attachedto the Empire, if it means as I believe it does, that I am a Liberal whobelieves that the Empire is best maintained upon the widest democracy and thatthe voice is most powerful when it represents the greatest number of persons andsubjects – if those are accurate descriptions of what Liberal Imperialist is,then I am a Liberal Imperialist.But Milner learnt that these were nothing more than gilded words. A year later,Rosebery quit as Liberal prime minister and never fully supported the partyagain. Milner then scraped together what was left of Rosebery’s loyalty andfading energy, and made him chairman of the Rhodes Trust.Milner had not yet reached the point where he could control the prime minister –and nor had he yet put himself forward for the job – but his new group offriends now included several people who had once held the position.Consequently, within a year they were all meeting at Rosebery’s mansion inBerkeley Square where, apart from Rhodes Trust business, Milner’s latestcatchphrase, ‘a new world order’, would often be aired. The atmosphere began toreek of intrigue.A glance at some of the names of those who came under Milner’s thrall, and theirsubsequent career paths, is instructive: Leo Amery, formerly of theKindergarten, rose to the position of colonial secretary in Britain, and whenMilner died, he took the reins of the Secret Society; Stanley Baldwin5[part0037.html#ch21fn-5] was three times prime minister of Britain; GeoffreyDawson was for several decades editor of The Times; H.A.L. Fisher rose to becomeroyal commissioner of India and warden of New College, Oxford; Edward Peacock, aCanadian, became an international financier at Barings Bank and a director ofthe Bank of England; Philip Kerr, who had worked under Milner in Johannesburg,ran Lloyd George’s prime ministerial office and was later appointed ambassadorto the United States of America. Quigley cogently observes: ‘If we look at thelist of Rhodes Trustees we see the Milner Group always had complete control. Inthe 1930s the group was stabilised for a long period as Amery, Baldwin, Fisher,Dawson, Holland and Peacock, with Philip Kerr, Lord Lothian, as secretary. Sixof these seven were of the Milner Group, four from the inner core.’ Of thosementioned here, Philip Kerr is the one to watch: an early member of the MilnerKindergarten, and one of its more radical reformers, he went on to play apivotal role in the development of the Secret Society. But Milner could stillnot see a clear way forward which would keep faith with his dead mentor’sConfession. By 1902, the policies of both Liberals and Tories were alreadybeginning to move away from the notion of Empire held dear by Rhodes.Up-and-coming Liberals like David Lloyd George had not even supported the Empirewhen it went to war – the Boer War, Milner’s war! Where would it all end?It is clear that Milner decided that, for the foreseeable future and with theenormous resources at his disposal,6 [part0037.html#ch21fn-6] his Kindergartenhad the potential to run a federated Empire. For that, however, he would need asteady flow of talent – the best that British universities had to offer. Not forthe first time, Milner went talent-spotting in Oxford. He initially placed theRhodes Trust in the secure hands of George Parkin, who had been a rovingcommissioner for the Secret Society since 1885. Some two decades later, in 1902,he became organising secretary for the Rhodes Trust, where he continued to workwith Milner for the next twenty years.Others were similarly woven by Milner into the changing tapestry of the SecretSociety. Philip Lyttelton Gell, who had first made acquaintance with Milner atKing’s College in London, went up with him to Balliol. In 1884 Milner appointedGell first chairman of Toynbee Hall – a social initiative in the East End ofLondon that attempted to close the gap between rich and poor. Just five yearslater, Milner made Gell a director of Rhodes’s British South Africa Company, andin his twenty-six-year tenure Gell was president three times.Milner himself seemed to have settled into a kind of neo-Jesuit existence.Intellectually, at least, he lived his life in accordance with precepts in adiary entry from his Oxford days: ‘One cannot have everything. I am a poor manand must choose between public usefulness and private happiness. I choose theformer, or rather, I choose to strive for it.’While the period 1905–1911 is sometimes referred to as ‘Milner’s lost years’, hewas in fact hard at work with close associates such as Parkin and Kerr. It couldbe said they were reconceptualising the Nietzschean notion of a superman as asuper bureaucrat: a man of superior intellect, loyal to the last, who livedtogether with other supermen in a cabal, resistant to the temptations of fame,flesh and financial fortune. Simply put, Milner was creating modern-day knightsin shining armour. Aptly, he went in search of his supermen at the College ofthe Souls of all Faithful People, better known as All Souls. Oxford students whoobtain ‘Firsts’ are eligible to apply for the few fellowships available at AllSouls. A New Statesman journalist once observed: ‘If intelligence can bemeasured by exams, the All Souls people by examination are the cleverest in thecountry.’A seven-year All Souls fellowship is today worth about £15,000 per annum, withfree board and lodging. In the first half of the twentieth century there werejust 150 Fellows. In 1903 Milner recruited Edward Wood, Lord Halifax. Thelatter’s biographer, Andrew Roberts, states: ‘It is safe to assert that theFellow of All Souls is a man marked out for a position of authority in publiclife, and there is no surprise if he reaches the summit of power, but onlydisappointment if he falls short of the opportunities that are set out beforehim.’Fellows of All Souls soon began to predominate in the Kindergarten. In hisbiography, founder member John Buchan lists his closest friends at Oxford asHilaire Belloc, F.E. Smith (later Lord Birkenhead), John Simon, Leo Amery, T.A.Nelson, Arthur Salter, Bron Lucas, Edward Wood and Raymond Asquith. Of thisgroup, five would eventually be Fellows of All Souls, and four would become coremembers of Milner’s nascent Secret Society. The group eventually expanded tosome twenty-five names. Each individual reached some degree of fame, with someoccupying cabinet posts and positions in the civil service, while most wereknighted, with more than half obtaining peerages. There were also influentialKindergarten sub-groups, and among these was the ‘group of seven’ who controlledand edited The Times after 1912.In the meantime, the money continued to roll in. Alfred Beit died childless in1906, leaving a far larger fortune than his mentor Rhodes. Beit’s specialinterest in the Secret Society’s imperial plan was railways – a mode oftransportation which would link British territories, ultimately joining the Capeto Cairo. Beit’s first bequest to the Beit Railway Trust was £1,200,000 – anenormous sum at the time. He also provided Oxford with a Beit Professorship anda Beit Lectureship in colonial history. So generous was the endowment that itprovided an income far in excess of the needs of the two chairs, and wassubsequently steered by Milner to other imperial projects, all of his choosing.Beit also gave money to the Bodleian Library in Oxford for books on colonialhistory. When, in 1929, the Rhodes Trust built itself a grand home in Oxford,these books were relocated to Rhodes House, thus becoming the Bodleian Libraryof Commonwealth and African Studies. The Beit Professorship also moved tooffices and a lecture hall at Rhodes House. Although these endowments ostensiblyincluded independent members on their governing boards, the Milner Groupretained actual control. By 1910, for example, the Beit Professorship wascontrolled by a board which included several Oxford dons, as well as Milner,Amery and Fisher. Three of these dons held ex officio fellowships at All Souls –where Milner now exerted great influence. So, Milner effectively controlled thevotes of five of the seven ‘electors’ to the Beit Professorship.Within a year of Rhodes’s death, Milner had transformed his theories for anevolved Secret Society into fully functional programmes which were steadilyproducing the two groups he needed: a cadre that was obtaining useful experiencein Africa in order to go on to administer the Empire; and Rhodes Scholarshipgraduates, bright young colonials from Oxford who would go home to lead theircountries along the same imperial lines.7 [part0037.html#ch21fn-7]A key person in Milner’s evolving viewpoint was Arnold Toynbee, who eventuallybecame his closest friend. While Toynbee had popularised the term ‘industrialrevolution’, he also defended an ‘elect’ class of society. Milner accommodatedthese contradictions, as is clear from his later support of Toynbee Hall – he infact came very close to committing himself to a life’s work of pioneeringsocialism. And then Milner made a momentous decision. In the early 1900s hejoined a dining club, a clandestine group with distinctly socialist leanings:the aforementioned Coefficients. Founded by radical early Fabians Sidney andBeatrice Webb, this group reveals much about Milner’s evolving politics.The Coefficients met monthly, and its members constituted a formidable group. Inaddition to Leopold Amery and rising political stars Richard Haldane and EdwardGrey, the club included journalist James Garvin, later editor of the Observer,and Leopold Maxse, editor of the National Review. Among its number wereluminaries like Halford John Mackinder, a geographer, politician and director ofthe London School of Economics; the philosopher Bertrand Russell; and thenovelist H.G. Wells. By 1905, Edward Grey would be foreign secretary, holding onto the job until 1916 – the longest continuous tenure for this office inBritain.The Coefficients lasted six years, eventually splitting up in 1909 when SecretSociety politics began to conflict with the beliefs and aims of certain members,and political differences began to show. Bertrand Russell, for example, resignedfrom the Coefficients after a row with Edward Grey over the imperial tariffissue. Amery invited those Coefficients supporting tariff reform – i.e. SecretSociety policy – to form a new club, the Compatriots.But none of this really mattered. Milner had used the Coefficients and theCompatriots as sounding boards for the Secret Society that he, with Rhodes, hisghostly mentor, had been planning for years. Via a series of secret meetings inthe depths of rural Wales, surrounded by his Kindergarten, he now readiedhimself to announce its name."},{"pageContent":"22Knights in Shining ArmourMilner chose a name for the transformed Secret Society that was based onEngland’s most revered cabal: King Arthur’s Knights of the Round Table. And so,in 1909, Rhodes’s Society was refashioned and renamed the Round Table. Itsset-up conferences were serendipitously held at a country house just up the roadfrom Arthur’s mythical Camelot at Tintagel, and were by invitation only. Membersof the Kindergarten were brought back to England to help run the neworganisation.Round Table principles reflected certain ideas propounded by the Coefficientsand Amery’s Compatriots, as well as a group called the Twelve Wise Men foundedby Sidney Webb, whose members, Webb insisted, should be ‘kept unconnected withany person’s name or party allegiance’. Secrecy was still imperative forsocialists and imperialists alike.The declared aims of Milner’s Round Table were no less ambitious than the ideasin the Confession of Faith, though they were far more worldly and workmanlike.Milner intended not only to continue Rhodes’s schemes, but to enlarge them sothat they encompassed the globe. So convincing was Milner’s leadership andcommitment that his acolytes devoted their lives to the implementation of hisplan.Extremely secretive at first, Milner’s Round Table gradually opened up as itexpanded throughout the Empire. It continues to survive, though thetwenty-first-century version barely resembles the original. According to theRound Table website, members ‘have fun, get involved with the local community,learn new skills, make friends and build trusted contacts’. Significantly, thatsame website still finds it necessary to declare: ‘We are not a secret society.’That Milner created the Round Table to echo Rhodes’s ideals is no long a matterof debate.* * *The founder members of the elite group that eventually established the RoundTable were a collective known as the Kindergarten. They lived fraternally in ahouse in Johannesburg, ‘messing’ in much the same way as Rhodes had with hisband of brothers in Kimberley. Rhodes’s close friend, the journalist EdmundGarrett, had hinted that something like the Round Table, an inclusive ‘unformedparty’, was under consideration at the time: ‘Rhodes and Milner both numberthemselves of that great unformed party which is neither the ins nor the outs …which I believe when it comes by a soul and a voice, will prove to include themajority of the British in Britain and a still greater majority of the Britishoverseas.’Milner himself indicated that a group like the Round Table was already in hismind when he retired to England. In a letter to F.H. Congdon, in which he turneddown what he probably perceived as a ‘too public’ post – president of theImperial Federal League – Milner hinted at a group that might function toameliorate conditions in a world that had become increasingly alarming, andwhere ‘injurious’ politics was ‘lauded to the skies from year’s end to year’send’. The situation could only be reversed through ‘a powerful body of men – andit would have to be very powerful – determined at all times and under allcircumstances to vote and work, regardless of every other circumstance, againstthe man or party who played fast and loose with the cause’. Milner’s letterconfirms his despair concerning British attitudes to Empire, and hissingle-minded determination to do something about it. It also advocates theestablishment of a dedicated body that would be far more powerful than the fourjust men of Wallace’s eponymous novel.Milner was fast returning to his Ruskinian roots, and his friendship with ArnoldToynbee focused his socialist leanings. Following the historian’s untimelydeath, Milner delivered his tribute, Arnold Toynbee: A Reminiscence, at ToynbeeHall. In it, he outlined principles that guided his own life and underpinned thenewly formed Round Table organisation:If by socialism you mean Collectivism, the abolition of individual property,then Toynbee was no socialist. On the other hand he was convinced of thenecessity for social reorganisation. The industrial revolution had shattered theold system of society [which] left to itself can not right itself. Salvationcould only come through deliberate corporate effort inspired by moral ideas,guided by the scientific study of economic laws.What is clear from all this is that Milner had been a secret society untohimself – a radical conservative concealing a fairly radical socialist. TheSecret Society which, together with Rhodes, Brett and Stead, he had helpedbuild, had suited Milner well; all four men wished to be just – though each, forhis own reasons, needed the cover of secrecy. However, unlike Rhodes, Brett andStead, Milner knew that British society would not accept rule by cabals. So heset out to create a society in which four just men (only rarely did more thanfour run it full-time) lived dual lives, shielded by the outer layers of asemi-secret hegemony – the Rhodes Trust, the Rhodes Scholarship programme and,in time, the Round Table.So complex a security structure was not easy to maintain – Brett broke coverfrequently – and a significant breach occurred in 1906, when John Buchanpublished A Lodge in the Wilderness. In the preface to this strange novel,Buchan pays tribute to ‘the brilliant minds of the Round Table’ – though Milneronly went public with the Round Table three years later, in 1909. A Lodge in theWilderness is a fictitious tale about a conference held at a lodge in EastAfrica where eighteen delegates, of whom nine were women, exchange views onvarious issues relating to the future of the Empire. It is as if Buchan isdebating Milner’s plan to rule the Empire through the agency of a secretsociety. Of all Milner’s acolytes, Buchan was the most sceptical concerning thepracticability of imperial federation. This may well account for the fact thathe left Milner’s service the same year he aired his doubts in his novel, andtook up a publishing career instead. Yet despite this, Buchan’s devotion toMilner never wavered, as this extract from his autobiography indicates:Milner was the most selfless man I have ever known. He thought of his work andhis cause, much of his colleagues, never of himself. He was simply notinterested in what attracts common ambition. He could not be bribed, for therewas nothing on the globe wherewith to bribe him; or deterred by personalcriticism for he cared not at all for personal fame; and it would have been aseasy to bully the solar system, since he did not know the meaning of fear.Buchan balances this accolade by pointing out an imperfection: ‘He cut himselfoff from some of the emollients of life. Consequently, the perfect administratorwas a less perfect diplomatist.’ Despite his qualms, Buchan remained in theMilner camp, and continued his friendship with Haldane and Grey, both championsof federated Empire.A Lodge in the Wilderness is especially revealing if the luxury lodge in EastAfrica is substituted with a wealthy estate in Wales – a scenario suggesting theactual manner in which the Round Table was ‘mooted’. A select few guests at asecret rendezvous cleverly captures the tone of the early clandestine meetingsof the Round Table. Buchan, who was extremely religious, seemed to regard Milneras a prophet-like figure surrounded by disciples in search of enlightenment inthe wilderness. His eulogy reflects his admiration of an imperialism thatbordered on the evangelical: it was not enough simply to believe in the cause,one had to go out into the world and proselytise. And that was the real missionof the Round Table, as will soon become apparent.One of the prime tasks at the Welsh country estate moot had been to work out howthe Rhodes charities and the generous donations of a Randlord,1[part0037.html#ch22fn-1] Abe Bailey, might be used to fund the Round Table.Philip Kerr became its secretary, assisted in time by Lord Brand. Lionel Curtis,whose support for imperial federation verged on the fanatical, set off as a kindof ambassador-at-large to set up the new structure in countries throughout theworld. He was accompanied by Kerr, and their project was funded by Milner. Inthis way, Round Tables were soon established in South Africa, Canada, NewZealand, Australia, and later in India. A new publication, funded by Abe Bailey,was established to further propagate the aims of the organisation. It was calledThe Round Table, with the subtitle A Quarterly Review of the Politics of theBritish Empire.2 [part0037.html#ch22fn-2]How this new structure worked is illustrated by Curtis’s first efforts,conducted in New Zealand, to form an independent plan for a united Empire.Curtis’s memorandum on the subject was distributed to five study groups who wereprovided with blank sheets for written comments. Based on this feedback, Curtisand Kerr produced a comprehensive report on the viability of the venture, andthis draft was then returned to the study groups as the basis of a final report.In 1910, five such ‘think tanks’ were set up in Australia, Canada and England.* * *That The Round Table was the mouthpiece of Milner’s new Secret Society was neverin dispute. Philip Kerr, who had edited The State, the Kindergarten’s propagandajournal in South Africa, also edited The Round Table. During the Second WorldWar, The Round Table was published from the headquarters of the Rhodes Trust andRhodes Scholarship programme, Rhodes House in Oxford. The atmosphere of secrecywas endemic: the magazine never named its editor, leader-writer or even itscorrespondents. Nonetheless, it was immensely influential (quite likely becausethose in the know politically knew who was behind it). The first issue of whatwould eventually become a quarterly magazine was published on 15 November 1910,and featured not a single name of any contributor. This anonymity has beenmaintained, and is justified on the grounds that anonymity gives the contributorgreater independence and freedom.It did not pretend to be a popular magazine, responsive to public opinion. Withstrong financial support from Milner, Rhodes and other Randlords, the magazinewas a conduit for a narrow set of views, mostly those of Milner, Curtis andKerr. Curtis wrote in 1920: ‘A large quarterly like The Round Table is notintended so much for the average reader, as for those who write for the averagereader,’ thereby echoing Milner’s Ruskinian ideal of a liberal autocracy. Milnerhad found a vehicle for his knights to do their good works, and fordecision-makers to get word of this, while himself sticking to the shadows. Andso, in the not-too-distant future, Milner would accompany his knights to theback garden of Downing Street – and he would see the government of Lloyd Georgethrough its darkest hour.Milner was much influenced by Frederick Scott Oliver, who had ‘a real andenduring influence on political thought’, according to Buchan. In his 1906biography Alexander Hamilton, Oliver put forward the blueprints of theFederalists of the early United States as a model for a federated BritishEmpire. The book came to the notice of Milner and was widely consulted by theKindergarten. Using the nom de plume ‘Pacificus’, Oliver wrote numerouspolitical articles for The Times. These articles, which first appeared in May1910, outlined his federalist ideas, especially his proposal for theestablishment of separate parliaments in the United Kingdom to deal with purelylocal issues. A supreme parliament would be responsible for national andimperial concerns.Oliver had attended the meetings at Plas Newydd in Wales, and he maintained akeen interest in the affairs of the Round Table. He became a member of themovement’s central forum, the moot, and helped edit The Round Table. He was alsoan anonymous contributor to the magazine. Oliver shared Milner’s dislike of thepolitics of the day, and claimed to despise democracy. He is best remembered forthe part he played in the Monday Night Cabal, an intrigue that had Round Tablesupport and brought Milner out of hiding and into the government of LloydGeorge.Running parallel with this political activity was Milner’s plan to take over themost influential part of the British press with the help of Regy Brett. By nowBrett was firmly entrenched as the most influential courtier in the land, andthese two spheres of activity were soon intricately enmeshed. Milner’s specialrelationship with The Times had a long and secret history. Its colonialcorrespondent, Flora Shaw, working through Moberly Bell, had acted as Rhodes’sagent throughout the Jameson Raid and the Boer War. Milner also had thesympathetic ear of All Souls Fellow George Buckle, who was editor of The Timesfrom 1884 to 1912. Leo Amery had been connected to the paper ever since 1889,and Regy Brett was offered a directorship in 1908. Kindergarten graduate W.E.Grigg, a staff writer from 1903 to 1905, ran the imperial department from 1908to 1913.Geoffrey Dawson was chief correspondent in South Africa for five years, from1905, becoming editor soon after the Round Table was formed. The Round Tablesustained this relationship until Dawson retired in 1941. The connection had infact been strengthened in 1919 when the owner, Lord Northcliffe, had a row withDawson over the influence of Round Table policies on the newspaper’s content.Under Dawson, The Times was a small-circulation paper aimed at thedecision-making elite, while Northcliffe wanted a more egalitarian spread thatwould be more profitable. Dawson, merely the tip of an iceberg of influence, wonthe battle, as the Round Table called in its rich friends, who by now includedthe Astors. They simply went ahead and bought the paper, and restored Dawson tothe editorship – a position he held for the next twenty years. The deal wasengineered by Milnerite economist Lord Brand, who had married Phyllis, sister ofthe first female member of the British Parliament, Nancy Astor.Stead creeps briefly back into the tale through the ubiquitous Flora Shaw. In1902, at the age of fifty, she became Lady Lugard, having married Sir FrederickLugard, a colonial proconsul whose influence rivalled even that of Milner. Aspy, secret agent and brilliant journalist, Shaw had, like Milner, learnt herjournalistic skills from Stead and her politics from Ruskin. And, like Milner,she had worked with the poor at Toynbee Hall. Far from being an opportunisticjournalist assigned to the Rhodes camp, Flora Shaw was ‘of the faith’. Later on,and despite her support of the Jameson Raid, she was made a Dame of the BritishEmpire.Carroll Quigley credits Lady Lugard with playing a decidedly significant role inthe Secret Society:The second person to come into the Milner group from The Times was Lady Lugard,who was probably a member of Rhodes’s secret society on The Times and appears tohave been passing from The Times to the Milner Group, when she was reallypassing from the society to the Milner Group. She and her husband are of greatsignificance in the latter organization.Never before has it been suggested that Flora Shaw, in the run-up to the JamesonRaid, was first and foremost a member of the Secret Society, with her role asTimes correspondent being secondary. Quigley may well be right. It is an equallyrare implication that the future Lady Lugard had, for most of her life, putpolitical activism above her journalism. With all this, it should also beremembered that it was Flora Shaw herself who wrote the fulsome sketch of Rhodesfor the 11th edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.* * *From 1909, whether individually or collectively, members of Milner’s Round Tabledevoted their time and energy to influencing British and imperial policy,including foreign policy cooperation between Britain and the self-governingdominions, as well as the push for independence in southern Ireland,constitutional reform in India and elsewhere, and the forging of anAnglo-American partnership. Articles from The Round Table magazine in theseearly years reveal imperialist thinking at its most jingoistic, albeitcompletely consistent with the attitudes of the majority of decision-makers ofthe early twentieth century. ‘The people must first be trained to understand andpractice the chief principles of commonwealth, namely the supremacy of law andthe subjection of the motives of material gain to the sense of duty to theinterests of the community as a whole,’ Lionel Curtis piously observed fromRhodes House.Echoes of George Bernard Shaw’s Man and Superman and the early Fabian beliefthat a ruling class was essential, provided it was benign, abound in these earlyeditions of The Round Table. The idea of democracy was treated with opensuspicion, and the imperialists even toyed with national socialism. In reality,Milner and the Fabians preferred the flip side of that coin, namely socialnationalism, or jingoism as it was more commonly known. In time, certain membersof the group, notably Dawson and Kerr, would, together with Lord Halifax andNeville Chamberlain, become infamous for their advocacy of appeasement withHitler and Nazi Germany. Nevertheless, in these early days both The Round Tableand The Times were anti-German in outlook.An anonymous article entitled ‘The Ethics of Empire’ – penned, presumably byKerr or Milner, and published in The Round Table – condemns motivations such as‘self aggrandizement and greed’. Instead, ‘duty’ is put forward as ‘a motivepower’ in the lives of Empire-builders. Commenting on this article, Quigley,though no great admirer of the Round Table, concedes: ‘They were convinced thatthe British Empire was the supreme moral achievement of man. The Milner Group isa standing refutation of the Marxist/Leninist interpretation of imperialism. Itsmembers were motivated only slightly by materialistic incentives, and not at allby the desire to preserve or extend capitalism.’Milner, poised at the centre of these events at the start of the new century,could already sense the winds of change gusting around the Empire. Again,Germany featured large in his concerns. ‘The existing parliaments are toosmall,’ he wrote in 1901, ‘and so are the existing statesmen they produce. Untilwe get a real Imperial Council with control of all our world business, we shallget nothing.’ And a decade later, Milner was ready.The Kindergarten had provided him with an elite administration he could rely on:Oxford men, the crème de la crème. The model for an imperial federation had beentested in South Africa, and Milner anticipated that rapprochement might even bepossible with America – indeed, there were those in the Round Table who weremooting the American constitution as a working model for the imperial stateenvisaged by Milner. And if the British were unable to produce the politiciansneeded not only to sustain but also expand the Empire, then he, together withhis hand-picked and devoted corps of administrators, would do it for them.Through Brett he had the ear of the King, and through the Astors and Dawson heenjoyed the commanding influence of The Times, the Observer and the Pall MallGazette.3 [part0037.html#ch22fn-3]Perhaps there is more to all this in terms of hidden ambitions than meets theeye. Alfred Milner had already saved the Empire from defeat in the Boer War,which Britain never expected to lose. Together with his Kindergarten, he hadthen gone on to govern a country (South Africa) five times the size of Britain.And now he was universally recognised as Lord Milner – the greatest imperialproconsul of his time. Did Milner perhaps contemplate leading this new empire?It was, after all, a federation of countries at least a thousand times the sizeof England, and where English – Rhodes’s winning ticket in the lottery of life –might be the first language. One thing is certain: Milner definitely had thewherewithal. Thanks to Cecil Rhodes, there were millions in the bank – withmillions more coming in from Beit, Barnato and Bailey, and unlimited credit fromthe Rothschilds, the Barings, the Lazards and the Astors. Even American bankerswere joining the Game.Small wonder, then, that Alfred Milner strode into the new century with suchconfidence, determined to rid the Empire of ‘rottenness’, and committed to theidea of establishing a new world order."},{"pageContent":"23The New World OrderMention the phrase ‘new world order’ today, and you will immediately feel afrisson, a sense of disquiet about secret elites and totalitarianism in the freeworld. At the start of the twentieth century, however, the phrase was simply arallying call for reformists – whether political figures like Alfred Milner orwriters like George Bernard Shaw.The term was usefully defined by William Lyon Mackenzie King, long-servingpremier of Canada, who already had considerable experience of the burgeoningRound Table. At a dinner party in New York during the Great War, Mackenzie Kingenvisioned a future characterised by unity and a new order that promoted peaceand freedom: ‘When victory and peace came the peoples of the BritishCommonwealth and of the United States would be united more closely than ever –as all the nations who have united in the defence of freedom would remain unitedin the defence of mankind.’These ideas clearly reflect Round Table dogma and Rhodes’s Confession of Faith.Milner’s new world order was no longer the unrealistic dream of an ageingBritish imperial proconsul. The Round Table was on the march, and indeed it waswell on the way to its destination. Mackenzie King was addressing the PilgrimsSociety, an elite British–American dining club that still exists today, andwhich maintains an air of secrecy. Set up in 1902 in London, and supported inpart by Milner and the Rhodes legacies, its patrons include members of theBritish royal family. The society has two branches, one in New York and one inLondon. When Mackenzie made his speech in New York it was well received by itsinfluential and wealthy audience.For the most senior of the Round Tablers, Lionel Curtis and Philip Kerr, theearly years of the twentieth century were spent in pursuance of a new worldorder, backed by Milner via the Rhodes Trust, much of which was invested inactivities on North American soil. Milner’s presence was felt at all meetings ofthe trust and deliberations concerning the Rhodes Scholarship programme, whichwas soon recognised as the most prestigious in the world. It was especiallyuseful in advancing Milner’s hidden agenda, and providing cover for hisactivities. On the face of it, the trust was nothing more than a group ofvenerable gentlemen chaired by the former prime minister, Lord Rosebery,administering a huge non-political charity. Few people bothered to look beyondthat. Yet the old hierarchy of the Secret Society – Milner, Jameson, Grey,Michell, Beit and Hawksley – were still there, focusing on huge tracts of theAfrican continent that Rhodes had acquired, and which were now devoted toadvancing the goals of Milner’s Secret Society.Rhodes owned vast acreages in Rhodesia, Bechuanaland and South Africa, with manyproperties being equal in size to some of the smaller English shires. Hecultivated much of this land, growing vines, fruit, deciduous crops and wheat,and he also raised cattle. And all the while his mining companies continued topump wealth from the depths of the earth. Then there were the dynamitefactories, mines of several kinds producing copper, asbestos and zinc, ‘model’farms, and, oddly, a number of hostels built to accommodate women in places likeKimberley and Malmesbury; in addition, there were the various schools anduniversities with their large endowments, and the Smartt Syndicate, a scheme –one of the first to use irrigation – for putting English settlers on vacatedBoer land, which, though unpopular with the locals, functioned until the 1950s.Rhodes’s money was well spent. Jameson used £20,000, which was a huge sum at thetime, to establish his Progressive Party and to fund his successful bid for thepremiership of the Cape. And Lord Rosebery administered a special imperial fundfor assisted emigration to the colonies.1 [part0037.html#ch23fn-1]Milner’s broader influences were hidden from public view. To all appearances, hehad little involvement, for example, in Chamberlain’s campaign for imperialpreferences, even though the stakes were high for him. The campaign had turnedinto a leadership battle, and, had ill health not brought Chamberlain down, itmay well have delivered a sympathetic British prime minister to Milner’s hands.His friend, indeed acolyte, Lord Selborne, was overseeing the politicalsituation in South Africa, with the old Boer republics and the grumblingAfrikaners toeing the line. The youngest, most ambitious – and visionary – oftheir generals, Jan Smuts, worked with Milner’s men to achieve the union theyhoped would be a model for an Empire federation.But the real goal was America. Lionel Curtis’s most important contact in theUnited States was the historian Louis Beers, who, in 1912, became the first USRound Table member who was not a British subject. His status is confirmed in abiographical article in The Round Table, which also points out that Beers hadwritten articles correcting what he perceived to be misconceptions in Americantextbooks about the British Empire. While agreeing with the Round Table’s aims,Beers categorically stated that Americans would never sign up to a conventionalfederation with the British Empire. He rejected the outrageous aim at the coreof Rhodes’s Confession of Faith, and so Milner and the Round Table began to seekways around it. From 1915 to 1918 Beers was appointed – anonymously, of course –American correspondent for The Round Table magazine, and he also promoted theorganisation’s aims in the American press. In the Political Science Quarterly,Beers describes Milner as ‘the intellectual leader of the most progressiveschool of imperial thought throughout the Empire’.Many influential Americans became de facto members of the Round Table. Theyincluded Isaiah Bowman, who taught at Harvard and Yale, eventually becomingdirector of the American Geographical Society; Thomas W. Lamont, a graduate ofHarvard, who in 1910 became a partner of J.P. Morgan & Co., and later endowedthe famous Lamont Library; Whitney H. Shepardson, an early Rhodes Scholar,became an immensely wealthy lawyer, businessman and wartime diplomat, whoeventually headed the Secret Intelligence Branch of the United States Office ofStrategic Services (OSS), which gathered intelligence via a network in Asia,Europe and the Middle East.As in Britain, the Round Table entrenched itself in the American press. WalterLippmann, twice winner of the Pulitzer Prize for journalism, was a clandestineproponent of Round Table ideology. Erwin D. Canham, who was editor of theChristian Science Monitor for twenty-four years, backed the Round Table andwrote in its support. Milner’s close friend, Lord Edward Grey, a founder memberof the Round Table, was, during his tenure as British ambassador to America, ananonymous correspondent for the Monitor.* * *At this point Milner was concentrating on America, and so the aforementionedPilgrims Society bears closer scrutiny. The original society came into being inLondon in 1902 (followed a year later by a club in New York); it was in manyways analogous to the Compatriots Club set up by Leo Amery after theCoefficients was deemed not sufficiently committed to the imperialist project orto Chamberlain’s imperial trade preferences campaign.It was initially a clandestine club whose members comprised the very rich,including Round Tabler Robert Brand of Lazards Bank, as well as the Astors andCharles Dawes, who, together with Milner, set up the financial rescue ofpost–First World War Germany. The Pilgrim influence on international affairs hasalways been as an old boys’ club for the WASP elite, relying on the prestige ofits invited speakers. The society’s somewhat ominous motto is Hic et Ubique –Here and Everywhere.Wholly beloved of conspiracy theorists, the Pilgrims Society is not so secretivetoday (indeed, Queen Elizabeth is its patron). Nevertheless, it remains somewhatwary of disclosing information regarding communication between Pilgrims inBritain and America – at least when they are not breaking bread together. Thenames of those who dine at the club, as well as those of famous guests andspeakers such as the Canadian prime minister – and, more recently, Prince Andrew– are mostly reported in the press. The society’s membership has never been lessthan extremely influential, and includes many who have randomly been encounteredin these pages: Alfred Beit, J.P. Morgan, Nelson Rockefeller, the Du Ponts andW. Averell Harriman. Other notables are General Haig, General George C.Marshall, US secretary of state Dean Acheson, US presidents Harry Truman andGerald Ford, and Prime Minister Winston Churchill.Though the decline of the Pilgrims Society has echoed that of the Round Table asa famous cabal, impressive monuments remain to its wealth and power and thescope of its original ambitions. Bush House, home of the BBC in central London,was built in 1919 by a New York Pilgrim, Irving T. Bush. Cut from Portland stoneat a cost of $10 million, it was at the time the most expensive building in theworld. Arthur Balfour, on duty for the Round Table, opened the building in 1925;it would serve as an emporium to promote transatlantic goods, and as a monumentto the blossoming Anglo-American entente. Dispelling any doubts as to itspurpose, standing before Bush House is a large statue of two semi-nude menholding aloft the torch of liberty while supporting two shields, one emblazonedwith lions, and the other with eagles. An inscription reads: ‘To the friendshipof English-speaking people.’Sadly, the spirit of cooperation depicted by the monument soon faltered, as didthe largely favourable press enjoyed by the Pilgrims Society. Indeed, as Americalapsed back into isolationism between the wars, even a respected structure suchas the Rhodes Scholarship programme became the target of attacks. Thisrepresents another of those occasions where the Secret Society had grownarrogant or impatient and pushed its luck with the press. In one of a series ofinsightful articles published in the Chicago Herald Tribune, William Fultonobserves that ‘Rhodes scholars dominate the United States department of state,which directs the doling out of billions in foreign aid, with the United Kingdomgetting the major share. The savants also hold down important positions in theeconomic cooperation administration, mutual defense assistance program, andother foreign handout setups.’This kind of allegation revived the suspicion that the Round Table was aclandestine cadre with imperial ambitions which would resurrect a kind of PaxBritannica. Fulton put it bluntly: ‘This is all in keeping with Rhodes’overweening ambitions for a world federation dominated by Anglo-Saxons for thepurpose of enforcing peace and the status quo.’ Fulton directly – and accurately– accused the Milner Group of seeking ‘the ultimate recovery of the UnitedStates of America as an integral part of the British Empire’.* * *Despite Milner’s expansionist ambitions, by 1915 things were not going that wellfor the Round Table. Lionel Curtis had the task of sifting through the vastamount of information that came in from Round Table groups in the dominions. Theanonymous reports were collated into two massive volumes which were neverpublished, though a thousand copies were returned to the various groups withstrict instructions regarding secrecy. Curtis drafted a summary of the reports,which, according to Quigley, revealed a shocking truth: ‘It soon became apparentthat there was no real agreement within the groups and that imperial federationwas not popular in the Dominions. This was a bitter pill to the group,particularly Curtis.’ In a gesture suggesting that too much democracy merelyconfuses things, Milner simply brushed aside the unwelcome information. Heaccompanied Kerr on a voyage to Canada, where he severely criticised the RoundTable groups for their anti-federation views.The next part of this history involves that most shadowy of British politicians,Sir Edward Grey, who in the early years of the century shared almost everyinterest of Milner’s, including founder membership of the Coefficients as wellas the Round Table. Moreover, as one of the most powerful Liberals in Britain,Grey led the country into the disaster that almost destroyed Milner’sclandestine network, the Great War. Before continuing, however, it is necessaryto differentiate the two Greys who feature in the story of Rhodes and his SecretSociety. The first was Albert Grey, the 4th Earl Grey and Liberal peer who grewvery close to Rhodes when he became chairman of the British South AfricaCompany. He, together with Brett, was the link between Rhodes and the colonialsecretary Joseph Chamberlain, both before and during the Jameson Raid.The second Grey was Sir Edward (the Earl’s cousin). Though also a Liberal, hewas a far more formidable politician. An unsuccessful candidate for theleadership when the Liberals won their landslide victory in 1905, Grey wasappointed foreign secretary under Henry Campbell-Bannerman. Like the Earl, hewas a great supporter of the Boer War and of Empire, and an admirer of Milner.He and Milner joined the Coefficients together, and it was at one of themeetings that Grey had his famous falling-out with Bertrand Russell over certainfriendly agreements – ententes cordiale – with other nations. Grey was in favourof these defence agreements, but Russell felt they would provoke rather thanprevent a looming war in Europe.Meanwhile, back in South Africa there had been a surprising development whicheventually resulted in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State being handed backto the Boer leaders. This was initiated by Jan Smuts, and though Milner did notmuch like the idea at first, Smuts worked closely with the Kindergarteners toreinstate the vision of a federated South Africa. Though sceptical of Smuts’smotives, Quigley concedes: ‘No stage could be too big for this young actor’sambitions and these ambitions were not, except for his own personal role, muchdifferent from those of Milner and Rhodes. But, as a very intelligent man, Smutsknew that he could play no role whatever in the world, or in the British Empire,unless he could first play a role in South Africa.’ And so, in 1908, Smuts – whowas by now back in favour with Milner – brought together thirty delegates fromfour parliaments: the Cape Colony, Natal, the Orange Free State and theTransvaal.2 [part0037.html#ch23fn-2] Two years later, on 31 May 1910, the Unionof South Africa came into being.Milner and Rhodes had got their way at last. The national anthem of the newcountry was ‘God Save the Queen’, and the British Privy Council was the finalarbiter in the administration of justice. Most importantly, however, when itcame to war South Africa was not a sovereign independent state but bound bydecisions of the British government. A perfect model for the Empire federation,it was especially useful for Milner’s propaganda campaign. The Union of SouthAfrica was a shining model of peace, clawed back from a disastrous war. TheCloser Union societies run by the Kindergarten in South Africa were, indeed,forerunners of the Round Table, which came into being around the same time asthe Union of South Africa.Abe Bailey funded the Closer Union magazine The State, and some of these fundswere siphoned off to start The Round Table magazine, which, as we know, was apropaganda sheet for Milner’s ideals of Empire. Its anonymous editorials had anOlympian tone that unambiguously set its imperial agenda. As John Buchanobserved at the time, ‘Loyalty to Milner and his creed was a strong cement whichcontinued long after our South African service was ended, since the Round Tablecoterie in England continued the Kindergarten.’None of this helped, however, with the negative feedback Curtis had receivedfrom the colonies concerning federation, which in turn raised serious questionsregarding loyalty to all the old ideals of Empire. Britain could, moreover, nolonger be confident that the colonies would unreservedly commit their young mento the war looming in distant Europe. In the face of all this uncertainty,Milner took the Society underground. Kerr, Curtis and Parkin continued workingat Rhodes’s dream of Empire, while Milner, with Brett as his chief politicaladvisor and royal interlocutor, surreptitiously implemented the core policies ofthe Secret Society.In his Milner entry in the Dictionary of National Biography, a seniorKindergarten member, Basil Williams, later describes the top-secret moots of theRound Table – and the not-so-secret discussions of the Coefficients – asfollows:Milner was always ready to discuss national questions on a non-party basis,joining with former members of his South African ‘Kindergarten’ in their ‘moot’from which originated the political review The Round Table, and in a moreheterogeneous society, the ‘Coefficients’, where he discussed social andimperial problems with such curiously assorted members as L.S. Amery, H.G.Wells, (Lord) Haldane, Sir Edward Grey, (Sir) Michael Sadler, Bernard Shaw, J.L.Garvin, William Pember Reeves, and W.A.S. Hewins.Regy Brett – by now a ubiquitous though invisible agent – is notably absent fromthe list. However, Brett was never anything less than a covert Secret Societyambassador, artfully spying upon and influencing the King.From about 1907 onwards, an influential group ran what amounted to a secretsecond cabinet in Britain. The group comprised Milner and Brett; press mogulslike Stead; fellow travellers like Haldane and Edward Grey; loyal lobbyists likeAmery; and bankers like Nathan Rothschild. Milner himself became part of thiscadre as the architect of the Round Table – a group that would extend not onlyhis own influence but Rhodes’s legacy throughout the Empire.At this point there was another unfortunate breach of security, to which theSecret Society was so vulnerable. On 27 April 1910 Regy Brett awoke to find thathis world had changed. The press had sniffed out his clandestine activities.Brett had just published a rather whimsical volume of essays entitled Today andTomorrow, but the reviews included one in The Daily Express which was openlyhostile. Under the title of ‘The Anomalous Position of Lord Esher’ the Expressreferred to Brett as the ‘arch-apostle of outside interference’:When an irresponsible civilian however clever, seems to arrogate to himself aposition which becomes practically subversive of departmental control … [then]amateur interference by irresponsible persons, however high in rank, cannot begood for the office in which it is exercised … A basic rule of the Britishconstitution is that influence shall be enjoyed in proportion to responsibilitytaken. This rule is unhappily violated in the position accorded to Lord Esher.The Express alleged that Brett was running the Committee of Imperial Defence(CID) and putting forward proposals for top officers, and that he wasattempting, through his chairmanship of the Army Reform Committee, to reform theWar Office itself – without consulting the army. As both these allegations weretrue, and since war minister Haldane and foreign secretary Edward Grey were bothBrett’s ‘men’, Regy Brett’s defence was entirely disingenuous: he had merelymade suggestions, and never final decisions, he claimed. In fact, Brett remainedin contact with Milner throughout. Moreover, he made these ‘suggestions’ withthe help of Maurice Hankey, who had been Brett’s protégé ever since 1908, whenhe was given the job of secretary of the CID under Brett’s chairmanship.3[part0037.html#ch23fn-3]Brett was not only duplicitous, he was also arrogant. Writing for the NationalReview – with Milner’s knowledge, no doubt – he commends Haldane for setting upthe Territorial Army, and simultaneously claims that recruitment is inadequate,recommending a compulsory call-up.But Regy Brett had failed to keep his head down. A harbinger of thiscarelessness – possibly its cause – was a sexual adventure that went wrong. Thatsame year, 1910, his affair with Laurence ‘Thrushy’ Burgis – who was fifteenwhen Brett first met him – had begun to fade. When Thrushy turned seventeen,Brett assigned him ‘secretarial work’, and later, as Brett’s ‘cousin’, Thrushyapplied for various government and army positions. As a result, a doctor wroteto the young man’s ‘cousin’, informing him that Thrushy was unfit for service:he had been diagnosed with syphilis.When Brett’s beloved son Maurice suggested that certain people resented Brett’srelationship with Thrushy, Brett hotly defended himself: ‘You might, but thenyou know there is no cause … I am obliged (and always have been) to have acompanion. But all those others, who don’t care a pin whether I am alive ordead, why should they care? Their lives would pursue an even tenor without me.They need not grudge me Laurence.’There could not have been a worse moment for Brett to suddenly find himself inthe public eye. His exposure in the Express article was soon picked up by otherpapers. The popular periodical The World launched a series of vitriolic articleswhich were so close to the truth of Brett’s secret activities as to makeeveryone, Haldane in particular, extremely uncomfortable. Brett was branded theéminence grise of a ‘Cabal’ under a headline that read: ‘Cabal? Conclusion: “TheCabal Must Go!”’:Our first demand is that Lord Esher, whom we regard as the fons et origo of theCabal, should be made directly responsible to parliament. His position should bedefined in a White Paper explaining why he has access to confidential War Officepapers, a privilege ordinarily allowed to the Secretary of War. He should beobliged to answer questions in the House of Lords. His performance is shroudedin obscurity.It should be remembered that ‘Lord Esher’, i.e. Regy Brett, is the very personwho had approached Joseph Chamberlain, warning him that Cecil Rhodes wasprotected by a powerful clandestine society, of which Brett himself wasindubitably a member.Haldane was obliged to rebuke Brett for attacking the War Office, Asquith was ofthe same mind, and even the King was critical. Instead of apologising, however,Regy Brett went on the attack. He was an unpaid member of the Committee ofImperial Defence, he was quick to point out, he found little pleasure in thejob, and he had never revealed its secrets. He then offered to resign his postat the CID. This was the last thing Haldane wanted, however, and he invitedBrett to spend the night at his Scottish home, hoping to brush the whole affairunder the carpet. Soon afterwards, Brett found himself another juvenileplaymate, so the year had a happy ending. He had learnt a lesson, and wouldnever make the same mistakes again.As the first decade of the new century drew to a close, the clouds of warcontinued to gather. By August 1911, the Secret Society believed that conflictwas imminent: indeed the prime minister had held a secret meeting to decide onstrategy in the event of war with Germany. Soon afterwards the press suggestedthat Brett’s CID had leaked confidential war plans to the French. In aninterview with the Guardian editor C.P. Scott, Brett denied this, pointing outthat most members of the CID were away on holiday. However, what he did admit towas the fact that a small cadre of ministers, who included Lloyd George andChurchill, advised by a general and two admirals, had used the holiday season toexchange ‘intimate communications’. These communications amounted to advancedwar plans between the army and navy chiefs of France and England – this in spiteof a British government pledge that no such thing would occur without theknowledge of the full cabinet. The fact that Brett was privy to this informationsuggests extremely close contact with Lloyd George, most likely through Milner,but possibly via Milner’s assistant Maurice Hankey,4 [part0037.html#ch23fn-4]who would soon be secretary to the war cabinet.By now Milner had lost his belief in Britain’s capacity for worldwide expansion.The conundrum he faced was how Britain, alone and unsupported, might bring peaceand order and civilised standards to the huge, disparate Empire. A federatedEmpire was the only answer to strengthening imperial defence. And the way topromote and publicise it was The Round Table – a publication that was, accordingto historian Walter Nimocks, constantly reminding the reader of ‘deficiencies inimperial administration which imperilled the future of the Empire’. Furthermore,it frequently examined the ‘irrational organization of the British Parliament,the ineffectual nature of Imperial Conferences, and the injustice over thesystem which gave to Britain war-or-peace authority over supposedlyself-governing nations’. Significantly, ‘the whole body of Milnerian criticism,and usually the Milnerian solution, was offered’.In the first issue of The Round Table (November 1910), all these themes,including the threat from Germany, were explored. Noting the possibility of‘conflict’ between Britain and Germany, and that there was ‘no means ofmarshalling the whole strength and resources of the Empire effectively behindits will’, Philip Kerr wrote in an article that there should be ‘some othermeans’ whereby Britain and the dominions might speedily make the necessarydecisions. Another article in the same issue, also by Kerr, titled ‘ForeignAffairs: Anglo-German Rivalry’, asserted that ‘the central fact in theinternational situation today is the antagonism between England and Germany …[and] the solution of this rivalry … is the most difficult problem which theEmpire has to face’. Kerr – and therefore Milner – characterised Germany asinherently aggressive and expansionist, dominated by Bismarck’s desire to extendthe German colonial empire, and to expand the German Navy. In May 1911 The RoundTable proposed a draconian solution: either the nations of the Empire must agreeto cooperate on foreign policy and defence, or they should dissolve the Empireand each assume responsibility for its own policy and its own defence.* * *Throughout this period Milner had stayed in the shadows, so much so that severalhistorians, including James Lees-Milne and the eminent Frank Aydelotte, went sofar as to suggest that the Secret Society died in 1905 when Milner retired, andthat the old Elect – Brett, Rothschild, Grey and Rosebery – went their separatepolitical ways. But the truth is that the Society metamorphosed and modernisedinto the Round Table organisation led by Milner himself, as his obituary in TheRound Table magazine confirms: ‘The founders and the editors of The Round Tablemourn in a very special sense the death of Lord Milner. For with him they havelost not only a much beloved friend, but one whom they have always regarded astheir leader.’But with the colonies beginning to waver in their support for the traditionalnotion of Empire, and with German militarism and Prussian belligerence growingdaily, there seemed little hope for the old Empire. With Germany and Austriaalready enjoying an entente, and Bertrand Russell forecasting that suchagreements could trip Britain into a continental war, a fellow Coefficient, H.G.Wells, insisted: ‘The British Empire had to be the precursor of a world-state ornothing.’Wells had by then written his science-fiction allegory War of the Worlds, inwhich an alien force with superior technology invades England. The novel conveysthe anxieties of the time, and may have provided Milner, years later, with aprism through which he viewed the German threat. For Germany was, with apparentimpunity, building a naval fleet to rival that of Britain, and, as Kerr was alsowarning, this weakened Britain’s ability to protect her dominions.Milner realised that Arthur ‘Bob’s-your-Uncle’ Balfour’s5[part0037.html#ch23fn-5] government was failing fast and was little more than anextension of the ageing Lord Salisbury’s nepotistic regime. Enormously rich,effete, elitist, and part of a bisexual clique, Balfour headed a government thatwas struggling, arguably as a result of political manoeuvring in which Milnermay well have played a part. Milner had initially backed both Rosebery andBalfour, but as the Balfour government began to fail, Milner’s contempt forBritish democratic institutions grew.In the months leading up to the collapse of Balfour’s administration, Milner’sclose friends Edward Grey and Richard Haldane, both arch-imperialists andsupporters of imperial preferences, met in secret at a remote Scottish Highlandslodge reminiscent of the Lodge in the Wilderness in John Buchan’s eponymousnovel published that same year, i.e. 1906. What emerged from the actualHighlands conclave was known as the Relugas Compact, after the lodge where themen had met. So closely were Grey and Haldane’s interests aligned with those ofMilner, that the compact reads like a plan for a Secret Society coup, or atleast a contingency plan in the event of Chamberlain failing in his campaign forimperial preferences and consequently failing to lead a pro-Empire, pro-Milnergovernment.The compact or ‘plot’ was that Grey, Haldane and another imperial preferencessupporter, Herbert Asquith, would refuse to serve in a post-Balfouradministration unless the King’s favourite, Campbell-Bannerman, accepted apeerage. This would leave Asquith in control of the House of Commons, and hewould find places for Grey, Haldane and possibly Milner in the new government.Grey, Haldane and Asquith were by now leading lights in the LiberalImperialists, a wing of the Liberal Party that strongly favoured an expandingEmpire.And so, the question is whether the Secret Society was on its way to becomingthe de facto government of Britain. The answer is yes – but not quite yet."},{"pageContent":"24PlottersThe 1905 Relugas plot1 [part0037.html#ch24fn-1] failed – though only partially.Throughout, the King had kept in touch with the plotters through his privatesecretary Francis Knollys. The King’s secretary communicated almost daily withRegy Brett, who, as Haldane records, was elected to be the plotters’ contactwith the King.After complex political manoeuvres involving Edward VII, and what amounted to aroyal injunction to the plotters – Asquith, Haldane and Grey – to get back inline, Asquith reluctantly agreed to serve as Chancellor of the Exchequer underSir Henry Campbell-Bannerman in a new Liberal Unionist government. His decisionmay well have been influenced by the fact that Campbell-Bannerman was in poorhealth, and as things turned out, Campbell-Bannerman died in 1908, having servedonly two years. Herbert ‘Squiffy’ Asquith – now married to Milner’s friendMargot – became prime minister. As for Haldane, a full decade before the startof the Great War, he bizarrely took the appointment of secretary of state forwar. He had no experience at all in military matters, and was entirely relianton Brett and Hankey at the Committee of Imperial Defence. Grey was made foreignsecretary.The Relugas plotters had hoped that their machinations would restore the formerprime minister, Lord Rosebery, as leader of the country or at least as foreignsecretary. For two years Rosebery had been chairing, in a somewhat desultoryfashion, the Imperial Federation League, which George Parkin hadenthusiastically taken abroad, with particularly successful outcomes in Canada.But Rosebery was beginning his slow retreat into self-doubt, depression andinsomnia that would eventually blight his political career. When Relugas failed,Rosebery all but gave up politics. He did, however, continue as a member of theSecret Society, chairing the Rhodes Trust while Milner was tidying up hisaffairs in South Africa. Indeed, during the next decade Milner’s own careersuffered a series of unfortunate setbacks, with Joseph Chamberlain ending uppolitically and physically incapacitated, Lord Rosebery suffering personal andpolitical disintegration, and Philip Kerr (Lord Lothian) brought low by hisill-fated love for a woman.With war now imminent, the involvement of the Secret Society inevitably becamemore visible. A government committee quietly and surreptitiously positioneditself at Richard Haldane’s side. Working incognito, its job was to recommendand promote major reforms in the British Army – and there at its head was RegyBrett, a man with not a shred of military training or combat experience. Hisquango was known simply as the Esher Committee. Haldane clearly needed all thehelp he could get in his new job as minister of war, an appointment that haditself been greeted with incredulity by most commentators. As in the case ofBrett, it was a posting that made sense only by factoring in Milner’s SecretSociety, soon to be given its new name: the Round Table.Haldane’s somewhat strange appointment was never fully explained. His preferencehad been Lord Chancellor, but instead he was offered attorney general and thenthe Home Office before being appointed minister of war. Regy Brett almostcertainly played a role in this. Edward VII was keen on a candidate who mightact as a middleman between the warring Liberals and Conservatives, and Haldanewas something of a Milner clone, a Liberal Imperialist albeit with strongsocialist leanings.2 [part0037.html#ch24fn-2]It is impossible not to see the hand of Milner – or a covert chain of command,at least – in these events. Milner the war-wise proconsul, to Regy Brett’s EsherCommittee, to the inexperienced minister Richard Haldane. Indeed, there was soonclear evidence of this. The Esher Committee called for sweeping changes which,in the months ahead, Haldane implemented in his new position as minister of war.Again, the detail of these reforms could only have come from a person who hadrecent experience of conducting a war, and who had strong views on what wasrequired of the British Army. And again, the only man who fits this bill isAlfred Milner. It is, moreover, inconceivable that Brett and Haldane did notconsult with Milner – in fact, a few years later, when Britain was in danger oflosing the Great War, Milner was summoned by the prime minister himself to servein government. Lloyd George was in need of rescue, and he finally recognisedMilner as his man.But a decade or so earlier, in 1906, the dangers were already becoming apparentnot only to Britain, but especially to the Empire. As early as January, Haldane,who had completed his legal studies in Germany, was persuaded by Edward Grey toprepare for a ‘Continental’ war in support of the French against the Germans – awar that would be triggered by the detentes Britain had signed. Haldane laterclaimed to have envisaged various reforms, including the establishment of animperial general staff, a British expeditionary force, a territorial force, anofficer training corps, and a special reserve. But it is extremely doubtful thatthis inexperienced politician could have conceived such a sweeping militaryshake-up in so short a time, and with no expert help.But in a sense the Secret Society was making the best of a bad job. HadChamberlain or Rosebery led the new government, Milner’s influence would haveknown no limits. But the ever-pragmatic Asquith, whose survival instinctsinvariably overrode other concerns, was less malleable. We may reasonablyassume, however, that any major item of British imperial policy emanating fromthe office of Edward Grey would have been seen by Lord Milner and vetted by LordEsher ‘for the King’. The same was probably true of Richard Haldane’s WarOffice. So, it is not an exaggeration to suggest that the inner core of theSecret Society operated as a kind of alternative cabinet a full decade beforethe Great War.The resignation of Arthur Balfour in 1905 had marked the start of a swing to theMilnerites by the long-term power brokers who, until 1903, had been led byRobert Gascoyne-Cecil, Lord Salisbury. A veritable clan – through marriage,nepotism and ennoblement of political allies – this group held sway in Britishpolitics for more than half a century. It was Lord Salisbury’s wont to encouragehis family members to form marriage alliances with the most eminent of thelanded gentry who then, almost by right, took seats in Parliament. To take justone example, the eldest of his five sons, James Edward Hubert Gascoyne-Cecil,the 4th Marquess, was in almost every Conservative government from 1900 to 1929.He had four children, two of whom married Cavendishes, with one becoming theDuke of Devonshire, and the other Lord Harlech. They both became politicians,and each of them produced several more.After Balfour’s political demise, the Milner Group gained prominence.Essentially, this was the Secret Society that had come of age. Quigley describestheir predecessors as ‘originally a major fief within the great nexus of power,influence and privilege controlled by the Cecil family’. However, under thehedonistic Balfour the group failed to grow, becoming ‘looser and lessdisciplined’. Balfour lacked the necessary ‘ambition and determination’ –qualities that Milner had in abundance, to the extent that he was ‘willing tosacrifice all personal happiness and social life to his political goals’.* * *By now, the talk was all of war. This reminiscence from Bertrand Russell’sautobiography, relating to the Coefficients, captures the mood of the times:Most of the [club] members … shocked me profoundly. I remember Amery’s eyesgleaming with blood-lust at the thought of a war with America, in which, as hesaid with exultation, we should have to arm the whole adult male population. Oneevening Sir Edward Grey (not then in office) made a speech advocating the policyof Entente, which had not yet been adopted by the Government. I stated myobjections to the policy very forcibly, and pointed out the likelyhood [sic] ofits leading to war, but no one agreed with me, so I resigned from the Club. Itwill be seen that I began my opposition to the first war at the earliestpossible moment.Amery argued in a speech that the threat of America to the British Empire was asserious as that posed by Germany. When Empire loyalists such as Amery criticisedthe Coefficients for being spineless and irresolute, they took Milner’s adviceand set up their own club, the Compatriots. Since a Triple Alliance alreadyexisted between Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy, Grey and some otherCompatriots embarked on plans for a counterforce of European nations. It islikely that Rosebery, by now a Rhodes Trustee, had a hand in this, as Grey hadbeen his undersecretary of state for foreign affairs. It is probable, too, thatthey would have run this past the military mastermind lurking in the shadows –Alfred Milner.Significantly, Grey’s first act as foreign secretary in the Asquith governmentof 1907 was the announcement of a Triple Entente between Britain, France and theRussian Empire. And just as Bertrand Russell had forecast, squabbles betweenEuropean sovereigns – among them Tsar Nicholas and Kaiser Wilhelm – made acontinental war increasingly likely. These ominous conflicts resulted in Grey’sfamous comment: ‘The lamps are going out all over Europe. We shall not see themlit again in our lifetime.’ And thus it came to pass, a war which really didbring about a new world order. Moreover, in 1918, when the time came to switchthe lights on again, only one man seemed capable of that – and once again theman was Alfred Milner.The Great War employed troops from all over the Empire, thus making it the firstworld war (significantly, that sense of global reach was an essential aspect ofRhodes’s Confession of Faith). The British cause was helped enormously by theRound Table, which by now was well established in all the colonies, as well asits magazine, which enthusiastically churned out propaganda to fuel Britain’swar effort. Inevitably, criticisms were levelled and scapegoats targeted: anallegedly over-secretive Grey was blamed for leaving Britain ill-prepared forwar, and when Haldane was falsely accused by the Daily Mail of being pro-German,the pragmatic Asquith let him go – hence his joining the new Labour Party someyears later.In the early years of the war, Milner still busied himself with the expansion ofthe Round Table organisation, administering the Rhodes Trust, and developing thescholarship programme. But all this changed in 1916 when Lloyd George turned tohim in desperation. The war seemed unwinnable, and Lloyd George had taken overfrom Asquith what was termed a ‘national government’. Milner was invited to jointhe five-man war cabinet, and it was not long before he became Lloyd George’sfirefighter.* * *America entered the fray, and it would later laud General Douglas Haig – ‘theButcher of the Somme’ – as the man who won the Great War. It was in fact thearrival of American troops and American ordnance that allowed Milner, togetherwith Haig, and via Brett, to engineer the Allied victory of 1918. This seemed tobe the moment when everything Cecil Rhodes had dreamed of in his Confession ofFaith came to fruition. Men from across the old colonial Empire, allied underthe Union Jack, speaking English, had sacrificed their lives to the ideal ofworld peace; as one, they had defeated the mighty enemy. Even more miraculously,as Rhodes had fervently wished, America had emerged from isolation to allyitself with fellow English-speakers in the cause of global peace.None of this took Milner’s Secret Society by surprise. A decade earlier, he andRegy Brett had sat down to make contingency plans, among the first of which wasensuring Haig was their man. Their connection went back to 1904 when, as a youngBritish cavalryman, Captain Douglas Haig, who had waged a successful campaignagainst the Boers, was patrolling the Cape Colony at the head of a column of2,500 men. He was mentioned in dispatches four times for his services during theBoer War. His final duty was to find and then escort General Jan Smuts to thepeace negotiations at Vereeniging. This is when Smuts began his lifelongrelationship with Milner, and his association with the Secret Society. The sameis true for Haig.From the Cape, Haig went to India as Inspector General of Cavalry. He became theyoungest major general in the British Army. In 1905, a year after arriving inIndia, Haig used his home leave to lobby for a job at the War Office. It is herethat the Haig story begins to interlock with the Secret Society, for the personhe went to see about a job was none other than Regy Brett – on Milner’srecommendation!While Brett still occupied his ex officio position on the Imperial WarCommittee, the committee itself had become all but moribund. This time, however,Milner and Brett tripped over their own presumptuousness: Haig’s application wasrejected on the grounds that it relied on ‘royal influence’ – a fact that waslater revealed by the highest military authority in the land, the secretary ofstate for war, H.O. Arnold-Forster. Notwithstanding this rejection, Haigcontinued to lobby Brett for the War Office job, and eventually he wassuccessful. With a new government installed in 1906, and with Richard Haldanesecretary of state for war, Haig was brazenly appointed as part of the ‘Esher’recommendations for reforming Britain’s war machine. In October that year, Haigwas appointed director of military training on the general staff. Haldane laterwrote that Haig had ‘a first rate general staff mind’ and ‘gave invaluableadvice’. Haig in turn would dedicate a volume of his dispatches to Haldane, whoby then had been hounded out of office for alleged pro-German sympathies.If we assume that Haig – generally perceived as having won the war for Britain –was not only Milner’s but also Brett’s man, it may be concluded that the SecretSociety played a major role in the Great War virtually from the start. No onehas ever questioned that, from 1916 onwards, Milner directed military policy, orthe more obvious fact that from 1918 he was Lloyd George’s secretary of statefor war. It is equally possible that he had planned this with his Secret Societycronies, Brett in particular, from 1914 – and perhaps even earlier.It is useful, at this stage, to glance at behind-the-scenes events. Once again,Regy Brett – in alliance with Milner – was at the heart of things. On 28 June1914, the process Bertrand Russell had predicted was triggered in Sarajevo:Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarianthrone, and his wife, Sophie, were assassinated. A friendly treaty turned out tobe a detonator, sparking war. In the wake of this, Brett hurried to London to benear the King and the cabinet. Austria issued an ultimatum to Serbia, thendeclared war. Tsar Nicholas, concerned for Russia if Germany entered the war,telegraphed his friend, the Kaiser, to say that ‘an ignoble war had beendeclared on a weak country [Serbia]’, and Russian public opinion was forcing onhim ‘extreme measures’ that would lead to war. Willy the Kaiser replied to Nickythe Tsar: ‘I have gone to the utmost limits of the possible in my efforts tosave peace. You and you alone can avert it.’But the dominoes were already tumbling. The Tsar, under pressure from hisgeneral staff, mobilised against Austria; because of its entente with Austria,Germany declared war on Russia and issued an ultimatum to Belgium; this led toGermany declaring war on France; England’s entente with France resulted in adeclaration of war on Germany. In a little over a month the whole of Europe wasat war. So much for ententes cordiale! The ubiquitous Brett was intimatelyinvolved in these eleventh-hour discussions. He had lunch with Asquith atDowning Street, and on the very eve of the declaration of war he spoke with theKing, who assured him that he had done everything possible in making personalapproaches to the emperors of Russia and Germany to maintain peace. But it hadall been in vain.As a consequence, Brett lost his military sinecure. With the commencement ofwar, Brett’s Committee of Imperial Defence was absorbed into the War Office.With Haldane now in charge, the upshot was that Brett was forced to gounderground – his preferred modus operandi. James Lees-Milne observes that ‘Therest of the world may have been mystified by what he was doing. That was theirbusiness. He didn’t care.’ Yet this is not entirely accurate, for Lees-Milneapparently ignores Brett’s clandestine relationship with Milner. The SecretSociety was certainly not mystified by Brett’s activities – and Milner certainlycared.Brett suddenly became very active in the County of London Territorial ArmyAssociation. He established an office overlooking the river in the Duke ofYork’s headquarters in Chelsea, where he busily set up a staff. Never a wealthyman, he somehow found the funds for this. His daughter, Sylvia, wrote of him atthe time:My father was in a turmoil of organization, flashing like a meteor from the Kingto the Army, from the Navy to the Flying Corps, dispensing wisdom. Many werejealous of him for he had no scheduled work and was not bothered by red tape.Lord Esher may not have been welcome, but they had to admit they could not dowithout him.The upshot was that Regy Brett, the Secret Society’s ubiquitous back-room boy,was forced by the war to peer somewhat further over the parapet than usuallysuited him. On a number of occasions he came close to blowing his cover again.His first move was to ingratiate himself with the new secretary of state forwar, the man behind the finger in the famous poster Your Country Needs You: LordKitchener. The first serving military commander to hold the job, Kitchener was ahero of the Boer War and India. Milner, of course, was very well acquainted withKitchener. By means of scorched-earth policies and concentration camps, the twomen had brought the Boer War to a close.Brett’s task was not an easy one. Kitchener was an imperious general and, it wasrumoured, very tight-lipped. Regy Brett no doubt exploited his Milner contacts,and would certainly have resorted to flattery, and by August 1914 the two menwere – if not literally – in bed together. Brett reports in his Journals thatKitchener had shared confidences about ‘his rotten army’, alleging thatKitchener was ‘damaging the whole organisation from not understanding and fromimpatience. There never was such a wild elephant. And yet his instincts are trueenough.’ According to the outgoing secretary of state for war, Sir CharlesBrodrick, Brett was soon invited by Kitchener to sit with three prominentgenerals on an ad hoc committee. They sat for a total of fifteen hours a day butdisagreed on almost everything, until Brett persuaded Kitchener to dismiss thecommittee.Brett’s increasingly intimate relationship with Kitchener culminated in himserving as an ambassador-plenipotentiary to France. Brett records that his taskwas to covertly ‘smooth out those constantly recurring difficulties that wereinvariably the world of tittle-tattlers and mischief-makers’ – ironically,Brett’s own field of expertise. Kitchener himself was at complete loggerheadswith the commander-in-chief of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) to France,Sir John French, and repairing bridges became the focus of Brett’s activitiesright up to the end of the war, first between Kitchener and French, then betweenthe British and French General Headquarters (GHQ). ‘This was a ticklish task atwhich Regy was adept,’ comments Lees-Milne. Sir John French was at least as vainand opinionated, not to say predatory, as Kitchener – and a good deal lessintelligent, as Lees-Milne implies: ‘Vain, too fond of smart ladies and society,of which he himself was no adornment, he was self-opinionated yet lacking inconfidence.’Regy Brett would have enjoyed considerable influence with Sir John, since he hadarranged for his son, Maurice, to serve as Sir John’s aide-de-camp. There was atthe time a famous incident which Brett managed to smooth over: Kitchener, assecretary of war, visited the front dressed in his field marshal uniform, whenhis official status was that of cabinet minister. Sir John took this as aslight, and Brett goes on to record that Kitchener was utterly contemptuous ofsuch touchiness: ‘Lord K’s big nature, his indifference to all men beyond a verycontracted circle of intimates, renders him impervious to the sensitivereactions of Sir John.’ The affectionate undertone to this note suggests thatBrett’s relationship with Kitchener had improved since the ‘wild elephant’ days,though as Milner would later show, this was no way to run a war. Still, Brettdutifully persisted with the job, letting slip, however, the basis of hiscommitment: ‘I delve down in the psychology of both men, being stronglyattracted to them, and try to find solvents for the acids that lie about theirhearts.’Clearly, Kitchener and French had a toxic relationship. Their fundamentaldifferences had serious effects, ultimately preventing them from coming to anyagreement about military strategy. Kitchener, Brett and the War Office believedthe British Expeditionary Force of 150,000 men should only be deployed once theFrench had held the German advance. The British Army would then be landed inorder to cut off the Germans from the Rhineland. The expectation remained thatthe war would be over within a few months. Though no military expert, Brett hadbeen particularly sceptical of the tactic whereby the small British Army wouldsimply tag on to the French Army – he feared that if the Germans took the Frenchchannel ports the BEF would be cut off from the homeland. This cautious plan wasoverruled by Sir John as well as the French, and so it was that the British wentoff to fight in the trenches. The Germans dug themselves in, equipped with ahigher quality of field weapons from factories like Krupps which had won theBoers the early battles of the Boer War. It was not long before the massslaughter began.By this stage the relationship between Haig and Regy Brett had blossomed, as hadHaig’s career. Early in 1914, Haig had been appointed aide-de-camp to KingGeorge V and taken command of the 1st Corps, which constituted half the BEF.Soon afterwards he crossed the Channel to France, where he fought alongside SirJohn at the Battle of Mons, which saw the BEF outnumbered three to one as theytried to keep the German 1st Army at bay. The BEF managed to repulse the firstGerman attack with their Lee-Enfield rifles and a rate of fire so rapid that theGermans thought they were facing machine guns. Eventually, though, the Britishwere obliged to retreat. Mons, the BEF’s first major battle, proved the fightingability of a relatively small army and raised British hopes. Sadly, things wentdownhill from there. On 1 July 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme,some 20,000 British troops fell, while another 30,000 suffered hideous woundsfrom heavy gunfire and shelling. To this day, this remains a one-day casualtyrecord.It was at the Somme that Haig acquired his nickname ‘the Butcher’, although itshould be said that the heavy casualties were as much caused by Joseph Joffre,commander-in-chief of the French forces, who regarded the Somme as a battle ofattrition, its aim being to drain the German Army of reserve forces. Territorialgains were a secondary aim. Sir John, Haig and Joffre initiated a ‘rolling’artillery barrage designed to clear everything in its path. It failed, however,and Tommies advancing on foot were confronted with barbed wire and concretebunkers relentlessly spewing machine-gun fire. The British infantry wereliterally mowed down. They had little chance anyway, equipped as they were withinferior and ineffective munitions.Behind the scenes, Milner fumed over the ghastly statistics: he was appalledwhen, at Mons, British casualties outnumbered the total Boer commandos. Therewas growing mistrust and dissent, as the French questioned Britain’s troopcapacity, and the British questioned France’s combat capability. All the while,Regy Brett went about his secret business, though he was warned by his sonMaurice3 [part0037.html#ch24fn-3] – now an assistant provost marshal in Paris –of the difficulties of trying to infiltrate the French military:I suppose K. is going to make you his representative here. Get authority fromthe P.M. too if you can. It will open doors much more easily in this country,where the first question is always ‘What position does he hold?’ They do not yetunderstand, I mean the people who matter here, who you are and why they shouldsee you! They are very hide-bound.However, Brett remained contemptuous of the French: ‘I am not going to putmyself out. I never do. Nor am I going to regularise my position which meansthat someone can give me orders. Very soon a moment will come when independentjudgment from the standpoint of the French4 [part0037.html#ch24fn-4] will bevery useful to Lord K.’Just how bonded and powerful Milner and Brett were is evidenced by Leo Amery’swar diary entry claiming that Milner at times acted completely independently ofthe government. In 1918, when the Germans made an unexpectedly rapid advance onParis and Haig began to talk of retreat to the Channel ports, Milner immediatelywent to France, with Amery – by then a colonel – at his side. Haig informed himthat the British 5th Army had been ‘shattered’ and that there was a breach inthe Eastern Front. Milner described the situation as follows:Haig was planning to retire NW to cover the Channel ports. This would have lefta gap opposite Amiens, through which the Germans could be expected to pour. Itwas then likely that they would wheel right and pin the British expeditionaryforce up against the Channel … it was necessary at all costs to maintain contactbetween the British and French armies and Haig and Petain [the French commander]must throw in their reserves to stop the breach … it would be necessary to putpressure on Petain to do this.Amery’s diary takes over the story: ‘Single handed and without Cabinetsanction’, Milner gave the command of the British Army to the French general,Foch, making him commander-in-chief of all the Allied troops. Milner had assumedthe de facto role of prime minister. Later that same day, the French primeminister, Clemenceau, accepted Milner’s decision: ‘Le General Foch est chargepar le gouverments britanniques de co-ordonner l’action des armees britaniqueset francaise sur le front oust.’ Given the speed with which Milner was movingaround France, it is quite likely that Amery’s suggestion is right: that LloydGeorge – le gouverments britanniques – knew nothing about Milner’s decision. AsMilner’s biographer John Marlowe concludes: ‘This probably saved an Allieddefeat.’"},{"pageContent":"25War and PeaceThe role of Milner and the Round Table in ending the Great War has largely beenforgotten. Mentioning either today is likely to draw blank stares. Similarly,Reginald Baliol Brett would not be given due credit for his significantcontribution. That said, Brett, and to a lesser degree Milner, have onlythemselves to blame for puppet prime minister David Lloyd George and an Americangeneral or two getting all the credit.Driven by desperation, Milner eventually put his nose over the parapet whenLloyd George invited him to join the war cabinet, though as an unelected member.And Regy Brett was only smoked out of the hole he managed to occupy for thecourse of the war when he became careless and attracted press attention. Thetradition of secrecy was, however, maintained by Curtis and Kerr and other RoundTable members who spent the war years running government committees so secretivethey didn’t even have names. The secrecy that prevailed has allowed the roles ofMilner and Brett to be largely unacknowledged and certainly under-explored. Weknow that they worked hand in glove, but how closely and for how long isunclear.At this point, a backward glance is useful. Ever since the turn of the century,the relationship between Milner and Brett had been more public, with Brettrecommending Milner for the prestigious position of high commissioner for SouthAfrica, and even accompanying him to the palace to collect the royal commission.Rhodes himself had, for some years, been close to Brett. Moreover, there isconsensus among historians that it was Brett who established the fledglingSecret Society in Britain, after General Gordon had introduced him to the idea.Soon afterwards, together with W.T. Stead, who was a trustee of Rhodes’s will,Brett joined the inner circle of the Secret Society – the Elect. Thus, in termsof hierarchy, Brett was senior to Milner in the Society.During the war, Milner was at first a behind-the-scenes force, and then, once hehad agreed to join Lloyd George’s government, he appeared to eclipse Regy Brett.However, this public face of Milner’s has merely served to disguise theextraordinary covert war that Brett continued to wage. As a start, Brett turnedhis quango, the Committee of Imperial Defence, into a military wing of theSecret Society. Indeed, there is confirmation of this even in Lees-Milne’shagiography of Brett: ‘After Balfour’s resignation the CID turned into a secretconclave.’ Lees-Milne goes on to record that in ‘January and February 1908 theCID were occupied in prolonged discussion of invasion and the forces whichBritain needed to repel an assault by a potential enemy such as Germany.’Shortly afterwards, Brett turned his hand to the British Navy.The issue that obsessed most military planners at the time was the Kaiser andhis plans for the German Navy – and the possibility that Britain might no longerrule the waves. Milner and Brett would have been vitally interested in thisissue as it was Britain’s maritime dominance that kept the Empire safe. Thisissue soon became an oft-repeated lead article in The Round Table magazine.At this crucial moment in history an eccentric character arrives on the scene:Admiral of the Fleet, John Arbuthnot Fisher, the First Sea Lord. Not only did heseem to have stepped right out of a Gilbert and Sullivan musical, ‘Jackie’Fisher was also in love with Regy Brett. ‘He was a contradiction of ruthlesstoughness and almost feminine sensitivity,’ says Lees-Milne. Passionately fondof dancing, Fisher would often dance the gavotte with his officers when at sea.King Edward loved his eccentricity and allowed him to take ‘personal libertiesdenied to others’. Brett records too that the admiral sent him ‘nautical loveletters’ that invariably began ‘My beloved friend’. According to Lees-Milne,Fisher was ‘absolutely convinced that war with Germany was inevitable, and hadbeen largely responsible for the ensuing arms race’. The admiral’s ‘navalreforms involved the wholesale destruction of small ships; instead of them heintroduced the huge dreadnoughts’. In all his decisions, Fisher was supportednot only by Brett, but also by the King.* * *Maurice Hankey – former protégé of Brett, and Milner’s assistant – played asignificant role in unfolding events. The French, who had called on Britain fora pledge of military intervention in the event of Germany declaring war onFrance, began to realise that a secret society existed at the heart of Britishpolitics. Their mistake, however, was to assume that this was Regy Brett’sCommittee of Imperial Defence, run by young Maurice Hankey, rather than Milner’sRound Table.As the threat of war grew, the French sent their London-based military attachéto see Regy Brett at his country house, Orchard Lea. Even though Brett still hadno official status, he and Auguste Huguet discussed the matter of Britishmilitary commitment to France. Immediately thereafter, the CID circulated a notesigned by Lord Esher which contained no such commitment, even though this hadfor a time been government policy. Behind Esher’s note lay Britain’s obligationsto the Empire. Nonetheless, in the summer of 1909 we find Brett suggesting toKitchener that he start making plans for the mobilisation of the million and ahalf partially trained men and officers who might be called up to defend theEmpire. Again, no such government commitment existed at the time.Brett claimed that his policy had the backing of Asquith, Haldane, Grey and eventhe opposition, i.e. Balfour, as indeed it may have had. Brett then invitedKitchener to be commander-in-chief of British forces in the Mediterranean, witha seat on the CID! The proposition, he stated, ‘commended itself to the King’,thereby indicating he saw his role as running a cross-party cabinet, with theKing’s full approval. Brett persisted in his claim that he was merely theinterlocutor – the proposal was Haldane’s, he insisted. But those in the knowsaw through this: Brett alone had the ear of the King. Moreover, the appointmenthe had offered Kitchener was far more significant than it seemed, for Brett wasfully aware of the War Office’s plans to expand the Mediterranean garrison,making it a large concentration of all the forces of the Empire, both naval andmilitary. All of this would have passed across Milner’s desk, thoughunofficially.Presumptuously, Brett demanded that the CID be strengthened, and when this wasrejected he threatened to resign in a fit of pique. Brett pointed out thatofficially the committee did not even exist. However, when later that yearEdward VII died, these concerns vanished. (Brett never did resign from the CID;he remained a member until his death.)The panjandrum of Edward’s court was much in demand for delivering obituaries,but Brett wisely kept a low profile. Instead, he focused all his efforts oningratiating himself with George V, efforts which proved largely successful.However, Empire affairs were not working out as the Secret Society intended.Curtis’s Round Table surveys made it depressingly evident that the dreamsentertained by Rhodes, Stead, Milner and Brett were probably not going to workout according to plan.These doubts began to be aired at the Colonial Conferences which had been heldsporadically since 1887. After the 1905 conference, a group met in secret todiscuss the likely shape and future relationship of the colonies, and in 1907convened a conference which called for dramatic change. Signs of Secret Societyinfluence are very obvious here. Specifically, there was a proposed change ofname to the ‘Imperial Conference’, which would sit every four years, and wouldcomprise the prime ministers and their staffs of the various self-governingcolonies of the Empire. This proposal was a thinly disguised recognition of theindependent nature of the new colonies. As Philip Kerr wrote in The Round Tablein 1911, the final outcome of the committee’s work was to destroy the hopes fora federated Empire by recognising the separate existences of the dominions.Nevertheless, the Round Table consoled itself with the fact that an imperial‘parliament’ rather than a ‘federated’ Empire was simply a rose by another name.Richard Haldane set up an interim plan involving regular ‘summits’ which wouldbe managed by Brett’s CID. Hankey was also brought in to help, and Lees-Milnepoints out the significance of this move:[Hankey’s] greatest achievement was the formation of the Cabinet Secretariatwhich brought him immense power, for no man was in closer touch with the PrimeMinister in wartime.Milner was clearly involved in these developments: by 1917 the CID’s assistantsecretary was W. Ormsby-Gore, who had been personal private secretary to Milnerwhen he joined the Lloyd George government. A lifelong member of the RoundTable, Ormsby-Gore went on to become colonial secretary.It had taken a failing war, with the concomitant threat of a failed Britain, tocreate the next opportunity for the Secret Society. The war had become boggeddown in France: both sides were like drowning moles stuck in rain-soakedtrenches. There were other debilitating consequences too, which were notimmediately recognised as medical conditions, for example the ‘shell shock’resulting from continuous bombardment by heavy artillery, and lungs destroyed bypoison gas used for the first time in war.1 [part0037.html#ch25fn-1] Many of thecrazed, dazed troops who tried to escape the noise and carnage were shot asdeserters. Welsh mining divisions burrowed underground so that sappers couldexplode mines under enemy lines. Heavy tanks made their first wartimeappearance, and, lumbering over the muddy terrain they often caused morepsychological than physical damage.Brett interfered throughout, going so far as to upbraid Kitchener for the‘disgraceful’ conditions, telling a boyfriend about the letter he had written tothe eminent field marshal: ‘I have made a tremendous fuss, and have got Lord K.to back me.’ After the Battle of the Marne, he and J.A. Spender, editor of theWestminster Gazette, travelled home with a party of British wounded. After lyingon bare church floors and in barns, the suffering men endured a twelve-hour trekin wagons until, at the nearest railway station, they were piled into horseboxes and cattle trucks. The worse casualties took at least thirteen days toarrive in England, during which time their wounds were unattended and theirdressings seldom changed. Brett arranged for Arthur Stanley, chairman of the RedCross, to accompany him to the front, where they wrote a memorandum to Kitchenerthat was circulated among the cabinet.When, at the Third Battle of Ypres, Canadian, Australian and New Zealand troopstook back the salient around the village of Passchendaele, Rhodes’s dream ofBritons fighting together to overcome the supreme enemy appeared vindicated.Even the most absurd of those dreams – bringing America back into an imperialfederation – began to seem possible as American opinion shifted in favour of hertroops fighting side by side with these English-speaking soldiers of the Empire.Milner began to believe that all that remained was to win the war and thusdemonstrate that such a union could produce military might too powerful for anyother power to contemplate war – in fulfilment of the prophecy of his mentorRhodes.Brett had inveigled his way into Kitchener’s confidence to the point that thisrelationship now rivalled the one he enjoyed with the King. He was in and out ofthe War Office at all times, with Kitchener eventually suggesting he beappointed chief of the imperial general staff. But Brett was quite content withhis behind-the-scenes role. There was another reason for this, of course. Had heheld any official position, and military information had leaked, he could havebeen shot as a spy. Lees-Milne asserts that by January 1915 Brett was ‘therecognised liaison between the British secretary for war and Milner and hiscounterpart in France. He had wormed his way, so to speak, into this unofficialposition.’ Brett had indeed informed his son Maurice of covert moves he wasmaking in setting up ‘a sort of Allied Council; very small, of Russia, England,France and Germany’ – a plan which apparently never came to fruition.Milner had complained to Brett that the French were not seeing enough ofKitchener, who had excused himself on the grounds that he dare not leave the WarOffice, which was very weak. Astonishingly, Kitchener told Milner that Brettwould from time to time deputise for him. Or, put another way, Regy Brett,unelected, with no official status, could play at being minister of war – a rolehe evidently relished. Lees-Milne describes the situation thus:By March 1915 Regy was de facto head of the British Intelligence Service inFrance, and in this capacity he wrote long, weekly letters to his friend,Maurice Hankey, Secretary of the War Committee.… Since Hankey regarded Regy as philosopher and friend, admitting that he owedpractically everything to him, Hankey could hardly have had a more valuablecontact with the French government.Lees-Milne makes it clear that by now Brett’s covert activities encompassed theWar Committee and Hankey himself, who occupied a supposedly more open governmentjob: ‘Hankey was, moreover, a man of his [Brett’s] own creation … Known as the“man of a million secrets”, Hankey had one of the most brilliant minds of hisday.’It was a mind that was undoubtedly well picked by Milner, Brett, Kerr, Curtis,Curzon, Amery and others who were by this time bound into a spiderweb‘secretariat’ that went by the peculiar name of the Garden Suburb – at the heartof which was none other than Alfred Milner. And the Garden itself was located inthe gardens of No. 10 Downing Street, the official residence of the Britishprime minister."},{"pageContent":"26The Garden SuburbThe year is 1915, and the scenario is one where Regy Brett is de factoambassador to France and deputy war minister, with Milner commanding ‘general’of the Round Table and also Lloyd George’s war minister in waiting. Their manHankey was in charge of the war cabinet, which itself controlled another oftheir creatures, Field Marshal Haig. Moreover, the secretariats supportingBritain’s war effort – Hankey’s Cabinet Committee and Kerr’s covert GardenSuburb – were top-heavy with Milner Kindergarteners like Curtis, who was alsoadministering the Round Table. So, in summary, this was the cast of charactersactually controlling events during the crucial period of the Great War.The most powerful of these groups was Philip Kerr’s Garden Suburb. So draconianwere its powers that Andrew Marr describes it as closer to the notoriousguillotine-wielding ‘Committee of Public Safety in the French Revolution than toa conventional British Cabinet’.1 [part0037.html#ch26fn-1] The young men of theGarden Suburb vetted all requests to see the prime minister, prepared specialreports for Hankey’s war cabinet, and monitored other government departmentswith a view to discovering how the decisions of the war cabinet had been carriedout. In a word, they spied on and monitored the elected government.Though Hankey’s war cabinet secretariat claimed to work independently of Kerr’scovert secretariat, Hankey himself patently worked hand in glove with Milner andBrett. The question is, how far did Milner’s influence extend over thesecommittees? The work of both the war cabinet and the Garden Suburb was announcedat a birthday party for Lloyd George hosted by the Astors at Cliveden,2[part0037.html#ch26fn-2] which by then had become something of a weekendwatering hole for the Round Table. The prime minister met all his newsecretaries and assigned them their duties; significantly, he was working from adocument laid before him by Kerr and another Milner man, W.G.S. Adams. Theseevents were the end result of Lloyd George’s traumatic takeover from Asquith inDecember 1916. This had been set in motion when, with thousands of troops dyingevery day, Asquith agreed to call up an extra 1.5 million soldiers – a decisionwhich so outraged Lloyd George that he resigned his seat, thereby bringing downAsquith’s government. For close on twelve months preceding this takeover, LloydGeorge had been courted by a number of key Round Table members, includingMilner, Kerr, Dawson, Amery, Waldorf Astor and the ageing Jameson. Diningtogether every Monday, often at Amery’s residence, the primary obsession of thisginger group was the replacement of Asquith with ‘firm leadership’. The groupbecame known as the Monday Night Cabal.For most Round Table members, the obvious choice as prime minister would havebeen Milner. However, a foiled attempt by Dawson and Astor to convince Asquithto resign in favour of Milner had resulted in the more politically adept LloydGeorge assuming the role. Though Milner had been trumped, Lloyd George’selection was a triumph for the Round Table: its most important members were soonworking for the prime minister, and two years later Milner himself becamesecretary of state for war. The Round Table appointments included Philip Kerr asLloyd George’s private secretary and foreign policy advisor; Leo Amery becameassistant secretary to the war cabinet secretariat; Waldorf Astor was appointedLloyd George’s personal parliamentary secretary, then to the Garden Suburb, andlater, through Lord Curzon’s influence, he occupied a seat in Parliament; RobertBrand, already serving on the Imperial Munitions Board based in Ottawa, waspromoted to deputy chairman of the British Mission in Washington DC; and JohnBuchan joined Lloyd George’s staff as director of information. The knights ofthe Round Table were everywhere!For some time, Regy Brett had been uneasy about the outcome of the war, writingto his old Eton intimate ‘Chat’ Williamson: ‘We are going to lose this war. Astalemate and a peace settlement that is only a truce. No flattening out of theGermans or reinstatement of the Belgians is possible … look at the maps and seewhat Germany has done and is doing.’ His report to the CID, The War After SixMonths, portrayed a victorious Germany enjoying a clear advantage.Still, Brett did not allow the war to entirely dampen his spirits. He loved todress up, and was nicknamed the ‘Dog at the Fair’ by embassy staff. At a partyat the Ritz, the ambassador, Lord Castlerosse, wryly observed of Brett’sappearance: ‘gorgeously caparisoned; round his neck a cross, and his breast wasso covered with medals that I came to the conclusion that not only must he be acommander-in-chief, but also must have played a prominent part in the 100 YearsWar’. Castlerosse recalls his first meeting with Brett, where he made the slyobservation: ‘We were introduced and I said there was certain affinity betweenus. I understand that you have your finger in every pie, and I, on the otherhand, go the whole hog and spend my life in hot water.’Neither the reality of war nor Brett’s doubts inhibited Milner in his strategyto enlarge the Secret Society’s circle of powerful friends. Featuring largeamong these were Waldorf and Nancy Astor, newly moved into their splendid homeCliveden on the banks of the River Thames. Waldorf’s father, William WaldorfAstor, had inherited a personal fortune based on the fur trade, New York slumproperties and sumptuous hotels, which, it was claimed, made him the richest manin America. In 1891, the year he relocated to Britain, Astor began constructionof the luxurious Waldorf Hotel on the site of his former residence in Manhattan.His cousin, John Jacob Astor IV, built the adjacent Astoria Hotel in 1897, andthe complex became known as the Waldorf Astoria.William Astor I lived at Hever Castle in England, becoming the first BaronHever, and he also owned the Cliveden mansion in Surrey. If not an actual memberof the Secret Society, William Astor was almost certainly a close associate, ifthe editorial bias of his newspapers is anything to go by. His first majoracquisition in England was the Pall Mall Gazette, which he bought from W.T.Stead. Astor then bought the London Observer and started a magazine, The PallMall Magazine, which published a number of politically inspired stories by H.G.Wells, some dating from the time Wells was a member of the Coefficients togetherwith Milner, Haldane, Grey and Amery.The link between the Astors and the Secret Society was confirmed when his sonWaldorf married a ravishing American divorcee, Nancy Astor, who became the firstwoman to occupy a seat in the British House of Commons. As a wedding gift, Nancyand Waldorf were given Cliveden – where, in time, the famous Cliveden Set wouldhold their soirées and the Secret Society its moots. Nancy Astor became a defacto member of the Round Table through a lifetime’s friendship with Philip Kerrbased on shared left-of-centre political beliefs, and, in time, a sharedreligion. Kerr was an ardent Christian Scientist and it was not long beforeNancy herself became a committed follower of the faith, as she remained all herlife.* * *In the meantime, the war had dissolved into a bloodbath. Hundreds of thousandsof weary, shattered men were giving up their lives in a contest for territorymeasuring no more than a few thousand yards – at most a few miles – andconsisting of barbed wire, shell holes and ruined villages. Morale was at anall-time low, with more troops needed on the Western Front, and Kitchener’sdrowning on a torpedoed warship. In Russia, revolution had swept away the Tsarand his family, and there were mutinies in the French Army. But just in timecame some good news. The Americans had begun to arrive in numbers, bringing withthem tons of modern ordnance. Regy Brett, who had virtually taken up residencein France, instantly saw an opportunity. As he had done with Kitchener, Brettinveigled himself into the favour of American General Pershing, so that Pershingeventually requested him to be official liaison officer between himself andHaig.At the same time, Brett urged the home government to send Milner to assist withthe warring Allies in Paris. His own sense of urgency – as well as his deepconnection to Milner – is clear from his journal entry: ‘I feel like Nelson whenhe used to pray for frigates! Send me Milner, Milner, Milner!’ In December 1917,he suggested that the government pack up the Paris embassy and establish Milnerthere as ambassador plenipotentiary. Regy Brett had decided it was time to makepeace. His views, however, somehow found their way back to the ambassador, whowas understandably furious:Everybody asks what Esher is doing here. He gives people to understand that heis the official agent of many important persons. One of his functions is toconvey messages from Sir Douglas Haig to the President of the Republic who,until I told him that Esher is merely a friend of the Field Marshall, thoughthim to be a distinguished military officer attached to GHQ.Brett had in the meantime ingratiated himself with Woodrow Wilson’s secret agentHenry Morgenthau, a close confidant of the president. Morgenthau was in Londonto explain to the British government what America wanted from a peacesettlement. What Regy Brett heard he judged to be naive, and so he wrote toHaig: ‘There is an element of pathos in the simple and serious faith of thesepeople [American politicians]. They are like early Christians in some well knownpicture attending white robed in the arenas hemmed in by wild beasts andshouting crowds.’ Brett saw dangers in such naiveté: ‘The unpleasant reflectionis that these same early Christians destroyed the Roman Empire and plungedEurope into the darkness of the Middle Ages.’ Brett seems to imply that theAmericans had their sights on the British Empire. Without mincing his words, hetold Morgenthau that President Wilson was incorrect in his assessment that theAllied forces were fighting a ‘war to end all wars’. Instead, the Allies’strategy should be to gain whatever they could from Germany to ensure they werestronger when the next war arrived. But Morgenthau responded that Wilson wantedthe moral high ground and was determined the war should end in a ‘righteous’peace. The war was far from over, however, and a crisis developed in Calais whenthe French demanded control of the Allied forces. Brett backed Haig, who refusedto surrender leadership and then resigned – though the King eventually talkedhim round.When the next revolution took place in Russia, the Allies were shaken. But therevolution found sympathisers in the Round Table. Taking George Bernard Shawwith them, the Astors paid a visit to Russia where they met the new Bolshevikhierarchy. Regy Brett was less sanguine, however; if the war did not end soon,the British royal family might suffer the same fate as the Tsar.With Allied casualties already totalling 400,000 at the end of 1917, some threemonths later, on 15 March 1918, Germany launched a massive assault against theBritish 5th Army. Seventy divisions of German soldiers stormed through France,winning back half the ground the Allies had gained at the Battle of the Somme.Brett – who had no right to secret information – was kept informed by Haig. InApril, throwing caution to the winds, Brett wrote to Chat Williamson: ‘The newsis bad. Very dangerous position. There are no reserves. The outlook is gloomy.Very.’On 27 May a second German offensive began, and this time the Germans progressedat the rate of three miles a day. Haig urgently summoned Brett to GHQ – Britainseemed on the brink of losing the war! Then a curious turn of events occurred onthe Western Front. The Allied forces finally coordinated their efforts with theAmerican advance, the German attack stalled as they met fiercer opposition, andthe ensuing delay over-extended the Germans’ ability to supply their forwardtroops. A retreat began which soon became a rout. Brett was strangely silent asthe Allies stormed eastwards, against his dire predictions. Notwithstanding thisadvance, Lloyd George responded to Brett’s appeals to put Milner in charge. LordDerby was removed as minister of war and Milner took his place.With the arrival of armistice, Brett became almost as anxious as he had been inthe months immediately before the peace. Old suspicions were resurrected, and hequestioned American motives for entering the war, suspecting they were tocurtail the influence and spread of the British Empire. He pointed out to Milnerthat Canadian government ministers were already making overtures to America.Brett and Milner’s work generally dovetailed: as Brett’s involvement in secretdiplomatic work increased, Milner kept his head down. And when circumstancesdemanded that Milner go public as minister of war, he emerged into the light andBrett went deeper underground. Brett’s relationship with Maurice Hankey wassimilarly linked: as Hankey’s star rose, that of the ageing Brett waned. Theirfates continued to be connected, however, as is evident from Hankey’s responsewhen overtures were made to him to take up the position of secretary general tothe League of Nations. Had he taken the job he would have been forced to quitthe British civil service, and so on 18 February 1919 Brett advised his friendto reject the offer. Hankey was tempted, however, and Brett himself shouldperhaps have shown more enthusiasm, since the new League looked a lot like thekind of international force for peace that Rhodes had outlined in his Confessionof Faith.Brett’s lack of commitment may be attributed to signals at the Paris PeaceConference, where the League was mooted: there were threats of growingrestrictions to British power, which in turn heralded further limitations toRound Table influence. By 1917 Britain was destitute, and its reserves of goldand American bonds were seriously depleted. Leo Amery, the Chancellor of theExchequer, warned that US president Woodrow Wilson would soon be ‘in a position,if he wishes, to dictate his own terms to us’.Wilson’s price for sending Americans to fight against Germany was afourteen-point programme for world peace. Each point was a nail in the imperialcoffin, the first four points especially: the abolition of secret treaties,absolute freedom of the seas, the elimination of trade barriers, and globaldisarmament. None of this was particularly good news for the Round Table, butthe real sting was in the tail, with number fourteen requiring ‘A generalassociation of nations formed under specific covenants for the purpose ofaffording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrityto great and small states alike.’ The Round Table’s initial reaction to thelatter was positive, with most seeing the ‘association’ as an imperialparliament by another name. And in any case, given the circumstances, thisassociation was the best that could be hoped for. Kerr, undoubtedly, was one ofits architects – if not the leading one. As historian John E. Kendle comments:‘The Round Table had its major wishes fulfilled when both a League of Nationsand a mandates system were established by the Peace Conference.’However, by this time Britain was no longer a true democracy. It was beingcovertly run by the unelected Milner and the even less representative GardenSuburb. A British journalist, Eric Walker, wrote scathingly at the time of a‘little body of Illuminati’ from ‘the class of travelling empirics of Empire,who came in with Lord Milner’ and had now taken up residence in the GardenSuburb for the sinister purpose of ‘cultivating the Prime Minister’s mind’.Philip Kerr’s advisory role on foreign affairs was perceived as being at theexpense of the trained diplomats of the Foreign Office. Permanent undersecretaryLord Hardinge complained that his experienced professionals were being sidelinedwhile ‘amateur diplomacy holds the field’. The Foreign Office had become whathistorian Roberta Warman describes as ‘a “passed-over” department with littleinfluence on the policy-making process’. Kerr believed the Foreign Office had‘no conception of policy’, while Amery accused it of a ‘general absence ofdefinite purpose’. Milner claimed its lack of ‘energy and promptness of action’was threatening Britain’s interests.By 1919 Milner was also ‘very doubtful about the success of the League ofNations’. He believed the League could only work ‘by virtue of the influence ofthe British Empire and America’: without that support, ‘the larger League [had]no future’. Milner cautioned Lloyd George against relying on the ‘shadow’ of theLeague of Nations at the expense of the ‘substance’ of the British Empire. Amerywas particularly dismissive, describing the League variously as ‘moonshine’, ‘afarce’ and a ‘sham structure’.And then cracks began to appear in the hierarchy of the Round Table. Kerr wantednot so much a peace league but a permanent conference of the great powers – theold ‘imperial parliament’ idea – and he declared himself ‘emphatically opposedto the plans for guaranteed or enforced peace … being propounded by pro-Leaguegroups in Britain and America’. Lionel Curtis broke ranks, as did Alfred Zimmern– a man Curtis professed to admire because his mind was ‘not shaped in the ironMilnerian mould’.Curtis and Zimmern first joined a pro-League group started by H.G. Wells, andlater another group, the League of Nations Society, which in turn led them intothe League of Nations Union (LNU). Distinctly echoing the Secret Society, thedeclared aim of the LNU was ‘The prevention of war by international government’.In an LNU article, ‘The Idea of a League of Nations’, published in the AtlanticMonthly in 1919, another such goal was mooted: ‘A general agreement on the partof mankind to organise a permanent peace’ or, failing this, the ‘progressivedevelopment of the preparation for war’. No mere ‘little league scheme’, theLeague was, according to Curtis, Zimmern and other LNU collaborators, a‘proposal to change the life and mentality of everyone on earth’. The‘World-League of Nations’ they ambitiously proposed was ‘either to be a greatthing in the world, an overriding idea of a greater state, or nothing’.Curtis (who spoke for the Round Table with at least as much authority as Kerr)coupled this with an impassioned plea for Anglo-American cooperation to ensurethe League would function efficiently. In fact, until it had ‘developed thestructure of a world government’, a powerless League ‘plastered with phrases andmade to look like stone’ would be ‘the greatest danger which can threatenmankind’. Finally, Curtis proposed a trusteeship system in which the Leaguewould direct certain powers to bring ‘peace, order and good government’ to those‘races who cannot as yet hope to govern themselves’ in ‘tropical’ Africa and thePacific.These proposals echoed almost verbatim Rhodes’s Confession of Faith, and it wasnot long before they were being enacted in places like Rhodesia. The phrase‘peace, order and good government’ could easily be substituted with the colonialcatchphrase ‘the maintenance of civilised standards’, and Alfred Zimmern wasspeaking openly of a ‘new world order’ as the only possible foundation for ‘theworld-State of the future’.The most prominent Round Table member was Philip Kerr. As private secretary andforeign policy advisor to Lloyd George for the period 1916–1921, Kerr’sinfluence was enormous. Both intimate companion and gatekeeper, Kerr virtuallydictated the prime minister’s policy on the League of Nations. He managed, forexample, to personally veto a suggestion that the League’s covenant imposeobligations on members to go to war in certain stated conditions, suggestinginstead ‘continuous consultation’, with solutions to each crisis to be decidedon a case-by-case basis.In contrast with all this theorising, Regy Brett was giving Maurice Hankeydetailed practical advice on how to conduct himself as secretary to theConference of Dominion Prime Ministers, instructing him to continue to worktowards the old Secret Society idea of ‘a league of Empire’. Brett also toldHankey to try to obtain an agreement on the issue of an imperial general staff.Brett’s manipulation of Hankey continued for many years. As late as 1929, Brettintervened with the prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald, when Hankey was notinvited to secret cabinet meetings. Brett’s extraordinary letter to MacDonaldshows the authority he still wielded, and reveals the continued workings of theSecret Society thirty years after the death of Rhodes:What is this I see quoted from a London paper that you are excluding yourSecretary from Cabinet meetings? It probably is untrue for you are the lastperson in the world to take a retrograde step towards ‘secrecy’ whether indiplomacy or government. The evolution of our Cabinet system from ‘Cabal’ hasbeen slow but sure. When the Secretary to the Cabinet became an establishedfactor in conducting business, almost the last trace of Mumbo Jumbo, cherishedfrom the days when Bolingbroke was a danger to public peace, disappeared.There is an interesting choice of words in this letter, with perhaps even aFreudian slip, for Milner himself had insisted on dispensing with ‘mumbo jumbo’in the evolved Secret Society – the ‘cabal’ – after Rhodes’s death. In theevent, Regy Brett got his way, and Maurice Hankey’s political career outlivedthat of Ramsay MacDonald; Hankey stayed on in the increasingly powerful role ofsecretary of the cabinet for another decade until 1938. When he eventuallyretired he was replaced by E.E. Bridges, who had been an avid follower of Milnerever since becoming a Fellow of All Souls in 1920.Alfred Milner had taken control of key foreign affairs, and together with Kerrhe ran his office as if it were the headquarters of the Round Table. Throughout1915, the Round Table had argued that the war should be used as a means ofbringing the countries of the Empire closer together. The Imperial Conference ofColonial Heads of State was postponed when war broke out, but the Round Tableargued for its reinstatement and used their magazine to publicise theirobjective. Upon taking office in 1915, Milner immediately cabled the dominionsand India with this proposal. By adding dominion members to the British warcabinet he created the imperial war cabinet. Milner wasn’t merely answering hiscountry’s call, he was also furthering the aims of the Secret Society.The Round Table magazine commended Milner’s initiatives and gave clear andauthoritative details of what they were designed to achieve:To consider what further steps can be taken to transform the Empire to a Statein which the main responsibilities and burdens of its common affairs aresustained and controlled by the United Kingdom into a commonwealth of equalnations conducting its foreign policy and common affairs by some method ofcontinuous consultation and concerted action.Significantly, the proceedings would be ‘secret’. The Commonwealth was all but areality – one that would effectively be run by the Secret Society. Milner’simperial war cabinet, packed with comrades like Jan Smuts, met fourteen times in1917 and once in 1918. At the end of the war, as the British Empire delegation,it attended the Paris Peace Conference. Milner invited the dominions toestablish resident ministers in London to ensure constant consultation. Dulyrepackaged and relabelled, this arrangement was nothing other than Rhodes’simperial federation.And so in 1919 Milner made the following declaration: ‘The only possibility of acontinuance of the British Empire is on a basis of absolute-out-and-out equalpartnership between the United Kingdom and the Dominions. I say that without anykind of reservation what so ever.’ Milner knew there was no real differencebetween dominions having their own resident ministers engaged in constantconsultation in London, and having ministers sitting as equal partners in aLondon-based federal legislature, as Rhodes had planned. Milner’s compromiseplan for a bonded Empire was well on its way.Two years previously, in 1917, Milner had drafted the Imperial Resolution whichavoided the controversial notion of federation by recognising the absoluteequality of the dominions and the United Kingdom – ‘under one King’. In hisobituary in The Times, Milner’s sleight of hand was described as follows:The special meetings of the War Cabinet attended by the Dominion PrimeMinisters, beginning on March 20, came to be distinguished as the Imperial WarCabinet [with which] Milner was more closely concerned than any other Britishstatesman. The conception of the Imperial War Cabinet and the actual proposal tobring the Dominion Premiers into the United Kingdom Cabinet were his. And when,thanks to Mr. Lloyd George’s ready acceptance of the proposal, Milner’sconception was realized, it proved not only to be a solution of the problem ofImperial Administrative unity in its then transient but most urgent phase, but apermanent and far reaching advance on the constitutional evolution of theEmpire. It met again in 1918, and was continued as the British Empire Delegationin the peace negotiations at Versailles in 1919. Thus at the moment of itsgreatest need, the Empire was furnished by Milner with a common Executive. Forthe Imperial War Cabinet could and did take executive action, and its decisionsbound the Empire at large.Milner’s ‘Commonwealth’ grew into the inter-governmental organisation whichtoday consists of fifty-three independent member states. Apart from Rwanda andMozambique, all of these states were formerly part of the British Empire.In 1920, the main concern of the Round Table was the avoidance of future warsthat might involve Europe, America and the Empire, and so Milner becameincreasingly fixated on world peace. From the beginning of the 1919 peace talks,the Secret Society had favoured ‘reasonable’ terms with Germany, and Milner andhis associates now effectively spoke for Britain.‘When the original draft of the Treaty of Versailles was presented to theGermans on 7th May 1919, the defeated delegates were aghast at the severity ofthe terms,’ says Carroll Quigley. Nevertheless, the French continued to pressfor tougher conditions. And when, later, the Germans defaulted on their warrepayments, France immediately mobilised and occupied the Rhineland. Thedominoes were beginning to tumble again. Philip Kerr was the Britishrepresentative on the Peace Commission, and through him Milner put on pressureto ease the terms. In her biography of Smuts, Sarah Gertrude Millin contendsthat the South African delegation, led by Smuts and doubtless influenced byMilner, demurred, refusing to sign because the terms were too harsh.The chief British objections were levelled against ‘reparations’ – payments byGermany that would later be blamed for the catastrophic inflation that deliveredthe country into Hitler’s hands, and ultimately sparked the Second World War.The Round Table, by now Lloyd George’s official ‘advisers’, thought ‘more hadbeen asked than Germany could pay’. France, however, was intractable, insistingon crippling reparations even though the British prime minister’s ‘advisers’argued that Germany could not possibly, for the next fifty years at least, posea danger to France.And so, ‘Kerr, Brand, Curtis, and the whole inner core of the Milner Group begana campaign to undermine the Treaty, the League of Nations and the whole peacesettlement.’ Quigley goes on to point out:Those who are familiar with the activities of the ‘Cliveden Set’ in the 1930shave generally felt that the appeasement policy associated with that group was amanifestation of the period after 1934 only. This is quite mistaken. The MilnerGroup which was in reality behind the phantom-like Cliveden Set, began theirprogramme of appeasement and revision of the [peace] settlement as early as1919.The Milner Group had come to accept President Woodrow Wilson’s view that therewere both good Germans and bad Germans – a view Rhodes himself had held aftermeeting the Kaiser – with the result that two Rhodes Scholarships were allocatedto Germany. However, this was a view that clashed with that of most Britons, forwhom the Germans were nothing more than ‘the Boche’.* * *A shadow soon spread over this generally peaceful post-war period. By 1920America had noted the lack of entente between her allies in Europe. And then theretreat to isolationism that the Round Table most feared began to gain ground inthe United States. The first sign that America was pulling up the drawbridgecame when the American Senate rejected the League of Nations in 1920. By thenMilner and the Round Table were also somewhat wary of the League, believing itto be a propaganda mechanism that was essentially anti-Empire.Regy Brett shared these misgivings. Having advised Maurice Hankey againstbecoming secretary to the League, he now confessed in his Journals: ‘Everyone isanxious; no one sees daylight anywhere.’ Underlying this anxiety was the growingreality that differences of opinion between Britain and the French regardingGermany seemed irreconcilable. A devotee of Brett, Philip Sassoon, who wasrelated to the Rothschilds and was also a member of the Round Table, hadattended the signing of the armistice, and he condemned the attitude of theFrench: ‘The German delegates were treated aggressively by Foch and Weygand[French delegates]. They were appalled by the terms imposed but quite helpless.’The French insisted that the League of Nations deal should include militaryforces on permanent alert, and an international force with autonomous policingpower. Milner disliked this French militarism as much as he hated Prussianmilitarism, and the two ‘Allies’ were now worlds apart. Rhodes still haunted thethinking of these Round Tablers: studiously avoiding the use of the term‘federated’, Kerr advocated an integrated Europe, hopefully in alliance withAmerica. But the idea was short-lived. America rejected it and the republicanFrench never even considered it.In his aptly titled Europe in Convalescence, Alfred Zimmern stated, ‘We standashamed, dishonoured, and above all distrusted before all mankind.’ In a similarmood, Jan Smuts declared that the reparation terms imposed on Germany would leadto German disintegration and immediate economic chaos – ‘a first-class andirreparable disaster’. The Round Table issue of June 1919 confirmed that Milnershared these views: ‘The Treaty is too severe. The spirit of the pre-armisticecommitments was violated and in detail after detail, Germany was treatedunjustly … specifically the reparations are too severe.’Nevertheless, Milner as foreign secretary was one of the signatories of theTreaty of Versailles. A bad peace deal was evidently better than no peace atall. Quigley states that from 1921 onwards, ‘the Milner Group and the Britishgovernment did all they could to lighten the reparation burden on Germany and toprevent France from using force to collect reparations’.Issuing a clear warning, The Round Table of March 1922 stated that ‘Britishopinion can no more tolerate a French military hegemony over Europe than itcould a German or a Napoleonic one, with its menace to freedom and democracyeverywhere.’ Such a situation would lead inevitably to the outbreak of war, thearticle insisted.By 1923 events were proving Milner right. He had been working closely with hisKindergarten economist Bob Brand. With runaway inflation already reducing theGerman currency to mere waste paper, The Round Table forecast a crisis: ‘Theprinting presses have been engaged in a vain attempt to follow the depreciationof the currency. That depreciation has been a direct consequence of the world’sjudgement that the Allied claims for reparation were incapable of being met. Itwill continue until that judgement, or in other words those claims are revised.’* * *By the end of 1923 Germany was in its death throes. The Secret Society, which bythen was utterly indistinguishable from the voice of the British government, wasall but threatening France with war, while the Americans were clearly in despairabout European politicians.Behind the scenes, Milner began to work on an initiative to use American moneyto relieve Germany of the crippling reparation payments, and also to get France,which was still occupying the Ruhr, out of Germany. The scheme that emergedbecame known as the Dawes Plan, and it eventually won its architect CharlesGates Dawes a Nobel Peace Prize. A close look at the people behind the DawesPlan reveals the global influence of Milner’s Round Table. Essentially still acovert organisation operating in accordance with the objectives of the RhodesSecret Society, the Round Table had become an international power broker whichhad close, even familial, links to international banking cabals that could anddid influence the outcome of world affairs. A ‘new world order’ is therefore notan inaccurate description of its ultimate goal.By now the Round Table not only had a following in America, but also manypowerful friends, including Thomas W. Lamont, head of J.P. Morgan and Co. Itwould be Lamont who would later call in Charles Gates Dawes to broker Milner’splan for the financial rescue of Germany. Lamont and Dawes, together with acommittee in England dominated by Milner, set up a $500,000,000 fund to prop upthe German mark, thereby getting the French out of the Ruhr. This plan, togetherwith an even more generous loan plan, the Young Plan, should have rescuedGermany, but by then inflation had done terminal damage to its economy.In the meantime, hardly anyone noticed a little incident now immortalised as the‘Beer Hall Putsch’ which took place in Munich on 8 November 1923. This failedattempt at revolution resulted in its leaders spending a few months in jail,which did their cause no harm. The leaders were the war hero Erich Ludendorffand the little-known Adolf Hitler, and the event gave birth to an infinitelymore draconian attempt at a new world order: the Third Reich."},{"pageContent":"27Tomorrow the World!With Europe rapidly collapsing into economic and political chaos, and the Empirealready a shadow of what it had been before the Great War, Milner and the RoundTable would have been forgiven for reverting to a survival plan of disastermanagement. But in fact the opposite happened. Immediately after the Great War,Milner, Philip Kerr and Lionel Curtis in particular began to set up a globalhegemony. It exerted influence through institutions and a hierarchy of thinkerswho linked policy in Britain, America and, in time, most of the countriesmentioned in Rhodes’s Confession of Faith. These institutions were all housed ingrand buildings which became known as ‘Think Tanks’.The first of these was the Institute of International Affairs in London, foundedin 1920. Little mention is made of its Secret Society origins or its Round Tableassociation, but in fact it was funded by the Rhodes Trust and the Abe Baileymillions. Later known as the Royal Institute of International Affairs (RIIA), ittook up residence in Chatham House at No. 4, St James, in the smartest part oftown. Just across the road at No. 10 lived the man alleged to be the richestperson in the world and one of the RIIA’s staunchest supporters, Waldorf Astor.At his side was his wife Nancy – political hostess, anti-Semite, anti-Catholicand arch-intriguer. While Chatham House was the Round Table’s ultimate and mostprestigious venue for policy debate, another, for a time, was the Astors’country house.The St James address is a clear indication of how influential and well-connectedthe Round Table organisation and the RIIA had become. Speakers at Chatham Househave included Mahatma Gandhi, Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher, RonaldReagan, Mikhail Gorbachev, Nelson Mandela, Yasser Arafat, Vladimir Putin, AlanGreenspan and Kofi Annan, to name a famous few.The RIIA soon had a sister organisation in America, the Council for ForeignAffairs, which is at least as influential. Since 1940, most US secretaries ofstate have been members of either or both the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)and the Trilateral Commission, which grew out of the council. This is also trueof most American secretaries of war and secretaries of defence. The CentralIntelligence Agency has generally been headed by a person who is a CFR member,beginning with CFR founding member Allen Dulles. Furthermore, for the pastseventy years virtually every key US national security and foreign policyadvisor has been a CFR member. A quarter of a century on, these have become thefaces of the Rhodes Secret Society.The RIIA, primarily through its Round Table ambassadors Kerr and Curtis, beganimmediately to set up affiliate and sister institutes around the globe. Typicalof these, and picked at random, is the Australian Institute of InternationalAffairs (AIIA) which was established in 1924 through Curtis’s efforts, becominga national body in 1933. It has identical aims to the RIIA – albeit more locallyfocused – and today consists of seven independent branches in each state andterritory, apart from the Northern Territory. The AIIA currently has amembership of about 1,600.The Pakistani Institute of International Affairs (PIIA) was founded in 1947 inKarachi in affiliation with the RIIA. It is located in Frere Hall, a magnificentRaj building named for Sir Bartle Frere, former high commissioner in SouthAfrica and political colleague of Rhodes. In 1934 the South African Institute ofInternational Affairs (SAIIA) was established in Cape Town, though itsheadquarters later moved to Johannesburg. These institutes all share the beliefthat right-thinking people, linked by a special relationship with the Englishlanguage, can influence the course of international events.The English language itself is regarded as the greatest success story of all. Ithas rapidly become a universal language, especially in the spheres of commerceand technology, particularly aviation, in a globalising world. People all overthe world are eager to learn the language they see as a tool of empowerment –or, as Rhodes put it, the winning ticket in the lottery of life.* * *There are other habits too that die hard, especially regarding anonymity. TheRoyal Institute of International Affairs is famous for its Chatham House Rule:1[part0037.html#ch27fn-1] ‘When a meeting, or part thereof, is held under theChatham House Rule, participants are free to use the information received, butneither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of anyother participant, may be revealed.’ This mirrors the manner in which Rhodes,Milner and the early more covert Round Table editorialists thought informationshould be dispensed – i.e. indirectly, via opinion-makers.The RIIA is also quite secretive about its origins, and one has to search hardon its website to find the name of Lionel Curtis – a founder of the Round Tablewho also set up the RIIA. Milner and Kerr get much the same treatment, whileRhodes fares even worse. There is no mention either of W.T. Stead or Regy Brett,without whom Milner would have been nothing but a colonial civil servant andwithout whom there would have been no Kindergarten, no Round Table and no RIIA.Institutions such as the RIIA were the means by which the Round Table planned tocement the early Empire-cum-Commonwealth into a new world order. As the RIIAgrew, it revealed that the old urge to proselytise remained an inherent aspectof the Secret Society in all its iterations and phases. Nowadays, admittedly,one has to dig for that dogma in the activities of the various Institutes ofInternational Affairs; however, try as they may, there is no escaping the basicimpetus towards benevolent amity – even if such activity tends to be viewed withsuspicion in today’s world.A whiff of Jesuit incense has hung in the air from the time the firstKindergarteners lived fraternally in the ‘Moot House’ Richard Feetham created inJohannesburg when Milner was still high commissioner. ‘Messing’ together, thegroup debated federal systems not only in South Africa, but also in the Empire.Philip Kerr – who had become Lord Lothian – is on record as routinely working aneleven-hour day and relentlessly driving his colleagues to do the same.* * *Once the Round Table was established in Britain, other moots were formed, eachoffering a rather monastic lifestyle. The situation was, however, enlivened byNancy Astor when – motivated by her love for Kerr – she encouraged weekend RoundTable moots at Cliveden. It is important to remember that the Round Table didnot – as Norman Rose has suggested – simply spring ‘whole from the earth’ whenMilner returned to England. Like many biographers, Rose seems strangely indenial or unaware that Rhodes, Milner, Brett and Stead had formed an earliersecret society of which the Round Table was simply an evolved form. He seemsunaware, also, that what he describes as Milner’s ‘Anglo-Saxon brotherhood’closely echoes Rhodes’s Confession of Faith, and that certain aims of the twocabals were almost identical.Milner was ever the Kindergarten’s role model, ‘a Roman of the Augustan Age’ asPhilip Kerr described him.2 [part0037.html#ch27fn-2] He and the Kindergartenwere clearly singing from the same song sheet when they set themselves up backin Britain. They were inspired by one book in particular, Frederick ScottOliver’s Alexander Hamilton: An Essay on American Union, and perhaps thefollowing paragraph in particular: ‘The union of the British race, the firm andeffective federation of our people in all quarters of the earth, appears to meto be of such transcendent importance as a matter of both morals and ofpolitics, that if the achievement of it required a sacrifice instead of a gain,I should be prepared to make it.’Oliver attended all the early meetings to set up the Round Table and became acontributor to the The Round Table magazine; moreover, he remained a loyalmember of the Round Table committee for the rest of his life. Most importantly,he was among the senior members of this band of brothers who came together onMonday nights at Astor’s house in St James, where they discussed strategies.David Lloyd George was an occasional guest at the meetings, where only aminority were not members of the Round Table. The idea of a global network offorums to promote Round Table policies, which soon manifested as the institutes,was first conceived by this cabal with Milner and Jameson always a strongpresence. Lionel Curtis was elected secretary of the first of these forums, theRIIA.Curtis’s loyalty to Milner, the Round Table, the Rhodes Trust and the Beit Trustis indisputable, and his influence was considerable: for this he was rewardedwith the post of Beit Lecturer in Colonial History at Oxford University, and healso became a Fellow of All Souls. The Beit Lecturer position was a fiefdom ofMilner’s, as, to a significant degree, was All Souls at this time. Both thelectureship and the fellowship had a secondary purpose, according to JohnMarlowe in his Milner: Apostle of Empire. Accordingly, Milner instructed Curtistouse his ample spare time to produce what became known, in the esoteric languageof the initiates of the Moot, as the ‘egg’ – a considered statement of theprocedure recommended and the organization necessary for the creation of anorganic Imperial unity, which could be used as a basis for a propaganda campaignto that end as soon as the time was ripe, when, in the words of one member ofthe Moot, ‘a conspiracy could be converted into a crusade’.The ‘egg’ Curtis duly laid was an Anglo-American Institute of Foreign Affairsfor the study of international problems and alliances with a view to preventingfuture wars – a familiar idea, traceable right back to Rhodes. America, however,was already retreating into isolationism, and the idea of a joint institutenever found traction. Consequently, the Council on Foreign Relations was set upin New York in 1920 to ‘turn the conspiracy into a crusade’ following meetingsat the peace conference in Paris between Curtis and Woodrow Wilson.Back in Britain, Chatham House, formerly the home of three British primeministers, had been bought for the use of the RIIA by a Canadian, Colonel ReubenWells Leonard. A businessman and philanthropist, Leonard chose to name itChatham House in honour of Pitt the Elder, Earl of Chatham, ‘to whom they, asCanadians, owed their status as British subjects’ – a clear alignment with theRound Table.These covert efforts to create a new world order did not go entirely unnoticed.In Milner’s Young Men, Walter Nimocks records that Wilfrid Laurier, Canada’slongest-serving prime minister, was extremely concerned about the activities ofthe Round Table. In 1917 Laurier is quoted as saying: ‘Canada is now governed bya junta sitting in London, known as the Round Table, with ramifications inToronto, in Winnipeg, in Victoria … receiving their ideas from London andinsidiously forcing them on their respective parties.’ Laurier’s concerns werewell founded.From 1919 Lionel Curtis orchestrated the massive expansion of both the RIIA andthe CFR, which finally encompassed the globe. What had started out as sevenInstitutes of International Affairs was expanded into a second network ofPacific Councils across Asia. By 1935 this new hegemony embraced China, Japan,the Dutch and French archipelagos, as well as Soviet Russia. In Australia, NewZealand and Canada, the various Institutes of International Affairs amalgamatedwith their Pacific Council clones. All of these bodies adopted the Chatham HouseRule, and could therefore choose to remain secret.True to Rhodes’s dream, Lionel Curtis had finally achieved not a worldfederation but certainly a global hegemony of like-minded spheres of influence.Nor should it be forgotten the degree to which the Kindergarten, as the covertRound Table, was influencing the governance of Britain. Milner was foreignsecretary. Philip Kerr was chief secretary to the prime minister, Lloyd George,and he also headed the Star Chamber. Leo Amery lurked in the corridors of power,as did Regy Brett. All were confident of stellar futures. According to the pressbaron George Riddell, Lloyd George viewed the Round Table as ‘a very powerfulcombination – in its way perhaps the most powerful in the country. Each memberof the group brings to its deliberations certain definite and importantqualities, and behind the scenes they have much power and influence.’But all that was about to change. Philip Kerr was the natural heir to theleadership of the Round Table and all its founding principles. His Kindergartenyears as Milner’s right-hand man had provided him with the necessary politicaland diplomatic skills. For the next three decades the talented Kerr didoutstanding government work at the highest level. In the end, however, hegratefully accepted the position of British ambassador to the United States, apost often bestowed as a retirement reward or, as in Kerr’s case, when acandidate had somehow stumbled.That hurdle proved to be Kerr’s nadir and his nemesis. For – albeit indirectly –the love of his life would also be the cause of his death: her name was NancyAstor. She fell in love with Kerr and he with her, and though a soulmate, Kerrwas never, alas, a mate. Nancy was a man-eater who chewed reflectively on hermany conquests, and then spat them out: she did not like the taste of men. Thiseventually included her husband, especially when he got in the way of herpolitical career.The rise and fall of Philip Kerr occurred at Cliveden. By then, however, theSecret Society was far from being the tough plant that Cecil Rhodes had pluckedfrom the soil of Africa and taken to Milner, Stead and Brett to transplant inEngland. By this stage of our story Milner and Brett were approaching theirfinal years, but their apparent successors seemed a breed of etiolatedintellectuals. Though all were superb civil servants cast in the Milner mould,they lacked the fibre, the reliable gut instinct of Rhodes, Jameson and W.T.Stead. And unlike Milner and Brett, they did not know how to live, how tooperate, in the shadows.Despite it being common knowledge that Milner was doing the real work behind thescenes, Lloyd George managed to hold on to the title of prime minister. TheRound Table realised Lloyd George had the common touch, that he had learnt hispolitics on the streets rather than at All Souls, and that he knew how to fillballot boxes.* * *Each of the chapters of this book has been obliged to jump backward and forwardin time because, while the main plot has progressed much according to theRhodes/Milner plan, sub-plots which could have derailed it were busily playingout in the background. How, for example, did a predatory paedophile like RegyBrett manage to retain his position as intimate courtier and secret courier inthe service of a series of monarchs while at the same time remaining Milner’sconfidant and an active member of the Secret Society? How did Milner and whatthe Canadian prime minister referred to as his ‘junta’ manage to manipulateevents in Canada and throughout the Empire? How did Rhodes manage to invadeLondon society with his entourage of burly boys during the dangerous Oscar Wildeyears? And who in fact was Catherine Radziwill, and who was she really spyingfor, and why?Far and away the most insidious of these sub-plots was the one just startingalongside the Thames at Cliveden. It began before the First World War, andalmost three decades later it had a huge effect on World War II. Once again, itis necessary to go back in order to go forward. In 1911, Philip Kerr set out onhis world tour promoting the Round Table. He travelled to Europe, the Near East,the Far East, India and America. Kerr came back physically exhausted andmentally depleted – in a ‘state of complete mental coma’, as he put it. Fragileand seriously in need of a retreat, his needs happily coincided with those oftwo ambitious Virginians: Nancy Langhorne and her sister Phyllis had justembarked upon a hunt through the English shires to find husbands in the upperechelons of British society.Phyllis met Round Table economist Bob Brand, and after a long courtship livedvery happily with him. Nancy was equally lucky. Both had had disastrous earlymarriages, but in 1905 Nancy met wealthy American Waldorf Astor, whose familyhad relocated to England at the turn of the century. A year later, she marriedhim. The newlyweds had been given Cliveden as a wedding gift, with more thanenough money to renovate and run the huge estate.Philip Kerr and Waldorf Astor had been contemporaries at Oxford. In the meantimeAstor had joined the Round Table. By the time they met up again in London Kerrhad risen in the organisation, occupying a place beside Milner at the top table.Nancy had, meanwhile, converted Cliveden to a light, flower-filled house, whichboasted inside and outside tennis courts and swimming pools. She openly competedwith her neighbour, Lady Bessborough, who happened to be the King’s mistress,and who hosted parties for influential guests. Nancy Astor had by now developedher own political ambitions, and so, apart from the artists, writers andreligious cranks who were invited to her soirées, on her instruction Waldorffilled the house with guests of all political persuasions.Quite where Philip Kerr fitted into this company is hard to say, though he didbring to Cliveden the new religion of Christian Science. Nancy took to the cultlike a duck to water, and thrived on it. When, soon afterwards, Kerr pledged hislove to her, she insisted that they kneel on either side of her bed and seekcomfort in Christian Science – a ploy that apparently worked. Having stolenKerr’s heart, Nancy coolly stored it away with those of her many other beausuntil his final days. There is no evidence whatsoever that their love, thoughnever denied and barely hidden, was ever consummated.Waldorf Astor, who indulged his beautiful, volatile wife by tolerating all this,remains one of the most underrated social reformers of the twentieth century. Hecould easily have lived a life of indolence – as indeed many of his peers did.And yet, defying poor health, he chose instead to stand in the 1910 election asa Unionist representative for Plymouth, one of the poorest Englishconstituencies. Astor held the seat until the constituency was abolished in1918, and thereafter he moved to the borough of Plymouth Sutton.Despite his wealth, Astor displayed his socialist soul by voting for LloydGeorge’s ‘People’s Budget’, which resulted in the National Insurance Act of1911. Astor held the seat in the Commons until 1919 when his father’s deathobliged him to move to the Lords. Nancy then stood in his place, and she was amember of Parliament until 1945, seeing the city through the German blitz whichalmost destroyed Plymouth. The Astors’ stewardship of Plymouth is a Britishparliamentary record, and Waldorf himself was granted the Freedom of the City.To this day, the city recognises their commitment.When it comes to Cliveden, however, and the demons that plagued Nancy Astor, therecord is less pristine. Waldorf had poured money into the grand house, andcelebrity guests from all over the country were soon travelling to Cliveden forweekend visits. The food was fairly average and the drinks did not flow freely –Nancy’s aversion to drink allegedly stemmed from the sexual abuse she hadendured at the hands of her alcoholic first husband. But there were other formsof stimulation, with the conversation in particular being excellent.The house became famous for its politically influential visitors. The RoundTable came so regularly to Cliveden that the house became their weekend moot. Inaddition to senior Round Table members, leading politicians like Arthur Balfour,Winston Churchill, David Lloyd George, as well as top civil servants likeHankey, and eventually even the King, saw fit to spend time there.Nancy proved to be a refreshingly different kind of hostess. While her socialcompetitors ran more sombre – and sometimes more sexual – soirées, Nancy would,to the gentle derision of her English guests, often dress up, put in a pair ofartificial teeth and give music-hall performances, sometimes even performingcartwheels. She insisted that her guests be as active as she was, playing golf,tennis and swimming, as well as hunting and taking long walks.Philip Kerr, a Scottish laird and an exceptionally good golfer, was often herpartner, and so the friendship developed, eventually becoming the most cherishedof both their lives. Kerr knew that Nancy would never leave Waldorf, but nor didhe want her to. Although she was devoted to the tall, angular Kerr, with hisdeeply spiritual inclinations, and flirted with him as all the five Langhornebeauties had been raised to do, Nancy Astor kept him firmly at arm’s length.Kerr and Nancy Astor had met at a critical juncture in both their lives. Aonce-devout Catholic, Kerr had suffered a spiritual crisis, and Nancy herselfwas in a spiritual limbo, having rejected the Church of England. Their searchfor an alternative led them both to Christian Science, which came to dominateNancy’s life. Indeed, her zealotry filled many of her friends, and even herchildren and family, with dread. It had been her sister, Phyllis, who firstintroduced her to Mary Baker Eddy’s Science and Health in the hope that it mighthelp Nancy through a period of niggling illnesses. After reading this self-helptome, Nancy’s physical health improved dramatically and remained excellent forthe rest of her long life. Sadly, the same could not be said of her mentalhealth.Philip Kerr himself had investigated certain Eastern religions beforeencountering Christian Science, a faith that appealed to him because it viewsphysical illness as nothing more than a mental ‘error’ or construct. He embracedthe belief system wholeheartedly and became Nancy’s spiritual advisor. Nancyherself became aggressively evangelical, insisting her children take dailyChristian Science tuition, though none of them fully espoused it. The authorHilaire Belloc stopped visiting Cliveden because of Nancy’s persistent attemptsto convert his daughters. Her interest in the faith was increasingly perceivedas fanatical. Along with these extreme religious convictions Nancy, togetherwith Kerr, developed a deep hatred of Catholicism. Her vehemence caused manysecular intellectuals to consider her insane. Indeed, her anti-Catholicism andgrowing anti-Semitism soon affected her political career.One cannot help wondering whether it was Nancy Astor, or, more accurately,Philip Kerr’s obsession with her, that eventually brought down the Round Table,thus finally burying the much-evolved Secret Society first conceived by CecilJohn Rhodes. It seems a sad fact that Philip Kerr, the heir-apparent to theleadership of the Secret Society, lost his way in the company of Nancy Astor.* * *But these developments lay in the future, when the Cliveden crowd became anotorious ‘set’ – by which time Philip Kerr was paying secret visits to AdolfHitler. For the moment, however, we shall go back to the period of mid-Edwardianexcess: the country was still in a heady party mood as the libidinous Edwardburied not just his mother but also the fifty years of mourning in which thewidowed Victoria had draped her kingdom. Much to everyone’s surprise, Edward wasturning out to be a rather good king, with a real interest in the state and thepeople. But the wretched political state of Britain ensured that the fun couldnot last. It was indeed fading fast by the time Edward VII died in 1910. TheAstors had, however, used these years well to build their influential salon, andwere now ready for the Round Table’s Cliveden moot to shape the destiny not onlyof the country but also of the Empire.Nancy Astor is not credited with having much influence on political events, mostprobably because her relationship with Philip Kerr is not fully understood.Nancy was unquestionably the dominant force at Cliveden, even if she did notdirectly influence political debates there. But she did dominate Philip Kerr,who was by now the most respected member of the Round Table elite, and arguablyits intellectual leader. She and Kerr spent much time together, not only atCliveden but at other Astor retreats, in particular the large beach house calledRest Harrow. ‘Their friendship grew particularly after Waldorf joined the RoundTable group and Cliveden became a regular venue for its Moots,’ says NormanRose. ‘Nancy too was undergoing a spiritual upheaval. Whenever they met at StMoritz or Biarritz, Rest Harrow or Cliveden, they comforted each other.’Initially, it was their joint interest in their new religion that provided themwith ‘comfort’, with Kerr concluding that Christian Science was ‘manifestly thereligion that Jesus of Nazareth taught’. Eventually, however, their faith becamean obsession, and this was a concern to their friends in the Round Table. ‘I amincreasingly convinced that Christian Science is the real key to all ourproblems, political and economic, no less than personal,’ Kerr wrote to analarmed Curtis. ‘Christian Science will have the first claim on my time andactivities … [but] it will make me a more valuable rather than a less valuablecoadjutor in any RT [Round Table] work that may be undertaken.’Kerr was living at Cumberland Mansions in London in a state of traditional mootcelibacy together with three other members of the Round Table who had aestheticleanings, namely Bob Brand, John Dove and Lionel Hitchins. Despite the celibacy,Brand had his eye on Nancy’s sister Phyllis, who was generally regarded as beingthe sweet, pleasant Langhorne sister. Yet Phyllis, who was married, was at thetime having an affair with a big game hunter. Such behaviour was pretty much parfor the course, though, if one was a Langhorne ‘belle’.‘There was an affinity between Philip and my mother,’ wrote Nancy’s son MichaelAstor. ‘Love on his side, and something deeper than friendship and lesspassionate than love on hers.’ Nonetheless, Nancy Astor’s usual valediction inher letters to Kerr was: ‘Your devoted and affectionate slave.’ Her considerablepowers of persuasion – indeed seduction – were not, however, confined to PhilipKerr. Lionel Curtis first came to Cliveden in 1911 and Nancy took him in hand;as he admitted later, she stopped him from living ‘in an atmosphere ofunpopularity especially among women’.Quite how influential the Cliveden soirées could be is illustrated by thefollowing encounter. One evening, Curtis glimpsed Winston Churchill strolling onthe lawns with Bob Brand and he decided to join them. Out of this meeting camean invitation from Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, for Curtis,Brand and another Round Table member, Edward Grigg, to join him on a cruise onthe Enchantress, Churchill’s Admiralty yacht. The purpose was nothing less thanto discuss and make proposals for resolving the Irish Question. Later, a clearlyunimpressed Curtis commented: ‘I haven’t any hopes of Winston … but if one wasonly friendly with people whom one respected we should not get much further.’While the Cliveden moot was being formed, a further expansion of Round Tablepower was under way at All Souls. One of the college’s most influential members,Geoffrey Dawson, claimed that its Fellows delighted in ‘politics in the widestsense’. He went on to declare that the Fellows ‘have taken it upon themselves noless a task than that of forming an unofficial committee for running, or helpingto run, the destinies of the British Empire’. Dawson, now among the elite of theRound Table through his early membership of the Kindergarten, had madeinvaluable friends in South Africa, and he was now reunited with them at AllSouls weekend moots. He had shared a cottage in Johannesburg with Lionel Curtisand Basil Blackwood, and also met Edward Wood (later Lord Halifax) there. At AllSouls, this group became intimate friends. Geoffrey Dawson would be rememberedas the editor of the London Times. It has been suggested that Waldorf Astor,under pressure from the Round Table, acquired The Times to secure Dawson’sfuture – this after Astor had locked horns with the previous owner, LordNorthcliffe. The more likely scenario, however, is that Milner had plannedDawson’s ascent to the position of editor of The Times some seven yearspreviously.Milner had surprised everyone in 1905 when he released Dawson from hisKindergarten duties in South Africa to allow him to take up the £2,000 a yearjob as editor of the Johannesburg Star. The young civil servant had absolutelyno journalism experience, but Milner had squared things with Lionel Phillips,one of Jameson’s raiders, who was by then a Randlord and held a controllinginterest in the Star. Milner then arranged for Dawson to go to England where hemet eminent Fleet Street journalists, many of whom were ‘friends’ of the oldStead–Brett–Milner Society of the Elect. The journalists included Leo Maxse ofthe National Review, H.A. Gwynne of The Standard and Fabian Ware of the MorningPost. It is possible that Maxse himself was by then already an active member ofthe Secret Society.Dawson also had long sessions at Printing House Square with Valentine Chirol,head of the Times foreign department. He also met the duplicitous Moberly Bell,the Times manager who connived with Princess Radziwill, and later with FloraShaw, to present the Jameson Raid in a favourable light so that Rhodes wouldavoid criticism. Dawson became a South African correspondent for The Timesbefore being made editor in 1912. While Milner undoubtedly had a hand in allthis, Dawson proved himself a skilled and resourceful editor. He held the postfor thirty years. Geoffrey Dawson was an active member of the Round Table inLondon and also enjoyed the more relaxing meetings at Cliveden; from the time hejoined The Times it was unequivocally Milnerite. In 1914, the paper published afamous leader ascribed to Dawson which could easily have been written by Milner(or Rhodes) himself: ‘The Empire cannot act at all unless it acts as one … theonly ultimate alternative to its disruption is a truly organic union.’Dawson remained an Empire loyalist all his life, in fact was often accused ofbeing ignorant of European politics. He never deviated, even after Milner’sdeath, from his conviction that, in words quoted by Norman Rose, ‘Imperial unitywas the key. If it was preserved and expanded, Britain’s place among the greatpowers was guaranteed; if it was neglected and disregarded, Britain would sinkto the rank of a second-rate power.’When Dawson in 1912 returned to London to head up The Times, Milner’s web wasconsiderably strengthened. Kerr and Curtis had also returned from South Africa,the Rhodes and Bailey fortunes had been put to work to create the Round Table –which in turn would provide the capital to found fraternal organisations aroundthe world. Dawson was in control of the most powerful newspaper in Britain, andWaldorf Astor was ready to buy even more of the media.During the time Dawson was editor of The Times he performed many other functionslinked to Milner and Rhodes: he was bursar of All Souls, a director ofConsolidated Gold Fields Ltd and of Trust Houses Ltd, as well as secretary tothe Rhodes Trust. He also became a power broker in his own right. Dawson was atEton with Edward Wood, Lord Halifax, and it was Dawson’s championship, togetherwith that of Milner, which helped Lord Halifax into the position of viceroy ofIndia in 1926.It still seems remarkable that such an erudite, sophisticated group could havebeen so easily seduced by a flighty Southern Belle whose only ambition, in thoseearly days at least, seemed to be to turn her house into a never-ending partywhere she could perform vaudeville stunts. But this is not as incredible as itseems. Milner had – rather carelessly, in retrospect – raised his All Soulsprodigies and his Kindergarten as hothouse plants: disciplined and intellectual,they were nevertheless a rather unworldly cadre. When Waldorf and Nancy Astorused their vast fortune to underwrite the Round Table moots, Milner’s men cameto Cliveden like lambs to the slaughter.* * *Edward VII had died in 1910 and was succeeded by the stricter, much veneratedGeorge V, who ruled soberly until 1936, by which time the Cliveden Set had beenactive for a decade. But a series of catastrophes, marginally involvingCliveden, then shook British royalty to its core. George V’s successor, EdwardVIII, fell in love with American divorcee Wallis Simpson, and after gauging thereaction of the Establishment, Edward decided to abdicate in favour of hisbrother George VI.Edward (whose preferred name was David) and Wallis Simpson are known to have hadclear Nazi sympathies. In this they were supported by a number of importantfigures among the Cliveden Set, a group of like-minded politicians who cameperilously close to achieving a fascist union of Europe in which Edward VIIIcould have returned to rule Britain. Wallis Simpson would have been his queen,Sir Oswald Mosley (or David Lloyd George) his prime minister, and the cabinet,in these duplicitous days before Neville Chamberlain met Hitler at Munich, mighthave included Lord Halifax and Leopold Amery.By focusing on Philip Kerr in particular in the context of Cliveden, and tracingthe Set’s movements and meetings in the years immediately preceding and alsoduring the rise of Hitler and the Nazi party, a startling scenario begins toemerge. And while the story of Edward’s obsession with Wallis Simpson has beenwell documented, the opposite is the case concerning his obsession with Nazipolitics and Adolf Hitler. Similarly, little attention has been paid to PhilipKerr’s secret negotiations with Hitler, despite the fact that he, along with twoleading political figures, Lord Halifax and David Lloyd George, with Nancy Astorin tow, were by then also making friendly calls on the Führer. Moreover, theirnames were at the top of what turned out to be a far longer list. And Edward’sreinstatement as a quisling king was a plan actively pursued by the Nazis, asrevealed in captured Nazi archives released by the American government in 1957.Wallis Simpson warmly accepted Adolf Hitler’s welcome kiss when she and Edwardvisited Germany in 1937. Efforts have been made to excuse Edward, and some havecalled his obsession with Wallis Simpson a great love story. Depending on one’sviewpoint, it took either great courage or great selfishness to abdicate andmarry the American divorcee, though the latter seems more likely. Edward fanciedhimself a moderniser, touring the Empire on fact-finding and flag-wavingmissions far more regularly than his father did, and he was generally liked bythe public.As events unfolded, Edward seemed keen to deal with Hitler not so much becausehe admired fascism as because he had served briefly in the Great War and did notwant a repeat of it. He was a ‘peace at any price’ man. But Edward’s mule-likeobduracy over Wallis Simpson and his subsequent abdication in 1936 created anightmare for Churchill, who was already fighting and losing the battle againstthe Germans in France. Edward remained comfortably supported by the Britishtaxpayer with all the perks enjoyed by a duke, a sinecure with a secret income,and a free Paris mansion provided by the French. Yet he continued to consortboth secretly and very publicly with the enemy.Edward and Wallis, by now the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, visited Germany inOctober 1937 against the advice of the British government, and met Adolf Hitlerat his Obersalzberg retreat. The German media gave huge publicity to the event,and the Duke inspected SS squads and gave full Nazi salutes to all and sundry.Indeed, as recent royal home movies have revealed, Edward taught hissister-in-law Queen Mary, as well as her children, the present queen and thePrincess Margaret, how to do so. Hitler considered Edward somewhat more than afriend of Nazi Germany and was convinced that Anglo-German relations could havebeen improved had Edward not been forced to abdicate. ‘I am certain through himpermanent friendly relations could have been achieved,’ stated Hitler’sright-hand man Albert Speer, who claimed to be quoting Hitler directly. ‘If hehad stayed, everything would have been different. His abdication was a severeloss for us.’When war broke out in 1939, the Duke was promoted to the rank of major generalattached to the British Military Mission in France. But when Germany invaded thenorth of France in May 1940, the new major general deserted his post, fleeingsouth to Biarritz, and from there to Spain. That July the Duke and Duchess ofWindsor moved to Lisbon, where they stayed with a businessman closely allied toGermany. Edward requested the Germans to guard his properties in Paris, whichthey did.Winston Churchill had in the meantime embarked on a major hunt for Britishappeasers (whom he called ‘defeatists’), finding help in unlikely places. A bookentitled Guilty Men, co-written under a pseudonym by future Labour leaderMichael Foot, identified a group of ‘arch-appeasers’: Neville Chamberlain, SirJohn Simon, Sir Samuel Hoare, Ramsay MacDonald, Stanley Baldwin, Lord Halifax,Sir Kingsley Wood, Ernest Brown, David Margesson, Sir Horace Wilson, Sir ThomasInskip, Leslie Burgin, Earl Stanhope, W.S. Morrison and Sir ReginaldDorman-Smith. The list includes three prime ministers (Chamberlain, MacDonaldand Baldwin), several of the most influential politicians in Britain, and RoundTable members or fellow travellers, including Lord Halifax, who at the time wasboth an appeaser and the King’s preferred candidate as next prime minister.There were many more anti-Semitic pro-Nazi sympathisers among the Britisharistocracy. They were led by David Bertram Ogilvy Freeman-Mitford, 2nd BaronRedesdale, and his wife Sydney Bowles. The couple had five daughters, two ofwhom, Diana and Unity, were devoted to Hitler – so much so that Unity claimedshe was in love with the Führer. In 1938 the Redesdales accompanied theirdaughters to Germany, where they attended the Nuremberg Rally and were won overby Hitler’s charm and his declared love of Aryans and of the British Isles.Redesdale later addressed the House of Lords, expressing support for Anschlussand the Sudetenland initiative. He became a strong supporter of Chamberlain’spolicy of appeasement, and Lady Redesdale went further, writing articles inpraise of Hitler and in support of National Socialism.Two years earlier, in September 1936, the former prime minister David LloydGeorge had visited Germany for talks with Hitler. According to The Express, whenthe Führer praised Lloyd George as ‘the man who won the war’, he responded thatHitler was ‘the greatest living German’. Taken on a tour of Germany’s publicworks, Lloyd George was much impressed.3 [part0037.html#ch27fn-3] He describedHitler as ‘the George Washington of Germany’, and confidently declared: ‘TheGermans have definitely made up their minds never to quarrel with us again.’After Chamberlain’s Munich debacle, Lloyd George back-pedalled – as he had atthe time of the Boer War – on the matter of appeasement. But not for long: in1940, after the Battle of Britain, he wrote to the Duke of Bedford advocatingpeace with Germany.With so many capable and experienced politicians sharing Edward’s pro-Naziviews, Britain came very close to having a Nazi king – indeed it is possiblethat Edward defiantly married his American divorcee in the belief that he wouldsoon be recalled to the throne by a new European order. Hitler’s propagandaminister Joseph Goebbels himself confirmed that Hitler had such a plan in mind.Only Winston Churchill’s quick-wittedness seems to have prevented it from comingto fruition.As near a thing was Lord Halifax becoming prime minister of Great Britain thenight Neville Chamberlain decided he no longer commanded the support of theBritish electorate – and once again Britain had Churchill to thank for avertingthat possibility. Halifax – the favoured successor not only of the King, LloydGeorge, the Cliveden Set, and most Round Tablers – was just a breath away fromoccupying the highest office in the land.But two candidates waited upon Chamberlain that fateful night in 1940: Halifaxand the far more bellicose Winston Churchill. Though Churchill had alreadyagreed to serve under Halifax, the latter decided at the last minute that heliterally did not have the stomach for the job. Halifax apparently suffereddebilitating stomach cramps in times of extreme stress, with the result thatChurchill stepped into the breach.Through all this, Edward remained sulkily hostile, demanding that the royalfamily receive his new wife despite the fact that accusations of Nazi sympathieswere mounting against Wallis. In February 1940 Count Julius vonZech-Burkersroda, who was German ambassador to The Hague at the start of thewar, claimed that the Duke of Windsor had leaked Allied plans for the defence ofBelgium.4 [part0037.html#ch27fn-4] Churchill had always treated Edward and hisnew wife with unusual grace, but his mood changed when Edward deserted hismilitary post in France and fled to Spain. The situation deteriorated furtheronce word reached Churchill through British intelligence that the Nazis werenegotiating with Edward and had a plot to kidnap him if he did not agree tocollaborate with them.* * *On the other side of the Atlantic, America was beset by anti-war activism andisolationism – as well as the demands of a determined group of pro-Nazis (manywith Irish connections) who included in their number the hostess of Cliveden,Nancy Astor. One particular American who had attended many of her soirées wasJoseph Patrick ‘Joe’ Kennedy, a wealthy businessman and Irish sympathiser whowas American ambassador in London.5 [part0037.html#ch27fn-5] He and Nancy Astorconducted a long correspondence infamous for its virulent anti-Semitism. Hitlerwould have to do far more than ‘give a rough time’ to the ‘killers of Christ’,she wrote, before she would get involved in ‘Armageddon to save them’.An appeaser throughout his ambassadorship, Joe Kennedy was openly pessimisticabout Britain’s chances in the war. In 1938 he had even gone so far as toarrange, without the approval of the State Department, an independent Americandeal with Hitler. Then in 1940, shortly before the Blitz, Kennedy sought anotherunauthorised meeting with Hitler to ‘bring about a better understanding betweenthe United States and Germany’. Throughout this period Kennedy was not only incorrespondence with but also attending social events in the company of the newDuchess of Windsor and her friend, Nancy Astor. Kennedy also sponsored the visitto England of famous aviator Charles Lindbergh, who was invited to Cliveden fora weekend in July 1938, and also to a luncheon attended by Kennedy and otherappeasers like George Bernard Shaw and leading Round Table member GeoffreyDawson. Lindbergh later wrote: ‘I was encouraged about the feeling of most ofthese people there in regard to Germany. They understood the situation betterthan most Englishmen do these days.’Kennedy urged Lindbergh to write a report on German air strength and, afterworking on it all night, Lindbergh concluded that there were not enough modernwar planes in ‘England and France combined’ to mount an effective defenceagainst Germany. He estimated that the Germans were producing 500 to 800 planesa month and had a total air superiority of some 8,000 to 10,000 aircraft –though it was later shown that the Germans had only 3,300 planes, many of whichwere not operational, against a combined French and British strength of 4,000.On his return to America, Lindbergh issued the following radio warning:‘Germany, on account of her military strength is now inseparable from thewelfare of every civilisation, for either to preserve or destroy it is in herpower. We are likely to lose a million men, possibly several million – the bestof American youth [in a war] which may lead to the end of Western civilization.’He proposed an embargo on the sale of offensive weapons to Britain, suggestingthat America should instead supply ‘all the defensive weapons [it] could spare’.This was the final straw for Churchill, for Britain was now alone in facing therapidly advancing German Army. With Franklin Roosevelt’s consent, Kennedy – whohad in a newspaper article questioned the existence of democracy in Britain andAmerica – was packed off home. Meanwhile, Roosevelt had been asking his ownquestions about the existence of a pro-Hitler conspiracy involving the Duke andDuchess of Windsor. Having ordered FBI agents to monitor the Windsors closelyduring their Palm Beach visit in 1941, he was surprised to receive a report ofthe Duchess’s affair with Joachim von Ribbentrop, who had been German ambassadorin London. This startling accusation came from a seemingly impeccable source:Duke Carl Alexander of Württemberg, a Benedictine monk who had assisted Jewishrefugees, and was on a Nazi hit list. He alleged that the Duchess had remainedin constant communication with Ribbentrop and leaked secrets to him.The net was beginning to close, not only on the Windsors, but also on DavidLloyd George and the appeasers of the Round Table."},{"pageContent":"28Cometh the Hour, Cometh the ManWhen war broke out, Joachim von Ribbentrop returned to Germany where he took upthe post of foreign minister. He turned his attention almost immediately to acomplex plan involving the German Secret Service, the Abwehr: Edward would beoffered sanctuary in Spain where he could prepare himself to be King of England,which would form part of the Third Reich.Many of the appeasers, among them Philip Kerr, Nancy Astor and David LloydGeorge, were either exploring options or in formal talks with Hitler. Inparticular, Lord Halifax met Hitler and suggested peace negotiations throughthird parties, although others among the ‘Guilty Men’ had already had secondthoughts after Hitler duped Chamberlain at Munich.Britain in the 1930s was still a time when the royal family enjoyedextraordinary immunity from adverse press comment, an immunity that extended toa large degree even to Edward after his abdication. Editors like Dawson at TheTimes and Astor at the Telegraph routinely suppressed controversial materialconcerning the royal family. This conspiracy of silence was, moreover, regardedas a matter of national security. With war clouds gathering, nothing could beallowed to blacken the reputation of a crown prince: neither his scandalousrelationship with an American divorcee, nor the degree to which he and his newwife admired Hitler and his ambitions. These tricky undercurrents were picked upby German intelligence who saw political advantage in the censorship –especially when it became apparent that Edward would abdicate, which he dulydid.1 [part0037.html#ch28fn-1]His rejection by the royal family became increasingly bitter. With the rapidadvance of the Germans, Edward abandoned his post in France and headed south tofetch his duchess at their chateau, La Cloe, and together they fled to Spain –in Edward’s favourite Buick, and with a van in tow that carried their luggage.On 19 June 1940, the Duke’s party was halted at the Spanish border and refusedentry. The impasse was eventually sorted out by an old ally, Sir Samuel Hoare –one of the Guilty Men – who was effectively in exile in Spain after Churchillcleared his decks of appeasers. Hoare wrote with alarm of the Duke’s arrival toChurchill: ‘Under the pressure of the German machine the Spanish press declaredthat you had ordered his arrest if he set foot in England, that he had come hereto make a separate peace behind your back and that he had always disapproved ofthe war and considered it an even greater mistake to go on with it etc., etc.’Churchill had a host of other problems at the time, not least Edward’sinsistence that he would only return home on his own terms: he demanded aprominent position, and the royal family would have to welcome his wife.Churchill knew he was not in a position to deliver on this, so he told Hoare tohold the Windsors in Spain while he tried to find a solution. But Ribbentrop hadalready cabled the Spanish foreign minister, Colonel Juan Luis Beigbeder,requesting him to discuss the situation with the Windsors. Beigbeder repliedthat he had gained the impression that the Windsors might ‘perhaps’ be persuadedto stay, with a view to the Germans eventually getting in touch with them. A newsense of urgency arose when Churchill appointed Edward governor of the Bahamas.There was apparently no prior consultation, and Churchill hinted that if Edwardrefused he might be court-martialled for deserting his post in Paris. Edward wasdevastated. The Bahamas appointment met none of his demands. However, whenChurchill made it clear it was the best he could offer, Edward accepted it. Buthe was playing for time, for by now the Spanish had offered him permanentresidence.The Germans moved in rapidly on the nervous Duke. Beigbeder was asked to detainthe Windsors in Spain ‘for a couple of weeks to begin with’ – though withoutthem being aware that the Germans were behind the detention. Then on 25 June,the German ambassador in Madrid, Dr Eberhard Baron von Stohrer, cabledRibbentrop: the Spanish foreign minister ‘had promised that he would doeverything possible to detain the Windsors here’.All this happened at a time when British politics was in a chaotic state and theRound Table had enormous influence: apart from Lord Halifax and several of theGuilty Men, there was Philip Kerr, who enjoyed an especially exalted status notonly as Nancy Astor’s soulmate but also as a political expert at Cliveden.Documents released from Britain’s Official Secrets archive have in factidentified the nature of the contacts between Round Table members and theirfriends in Germany.Among the latter was Count Helmuth von Moltke, remembered as the intellectualleader of the German resistance who would lose his life in the mass executionsthat followed the plot to assassinate Hitler. Moltke was also the anonymousaddressee – ‘Hans’ – of American Dorothy Thompson’s ‘Listen, Hans’ broadcastsfrom Germany.2 [part0037.html#ch28fn-2] It is possible that the Round Table,through Moltke, influenced the strategy of this German resistance group from themid-thirties onwards, and compelling evidence has emerged to support the idea.Moltke’s father was from a long line of Prussian military aristocrats, but it ison his mother’s side that we find Helmuth’s links to the Round Table. His motherwas Dorothy Rose-Innes, daughter of Sir James Rose-Innes, Rhodes’s attorneygeneral who became chief justice of the Transvaal in 1902, and later chiefjustice of South Africa from 1914 to 1927.Moltke visited England regularly from 1934, even being mentioned in The RoundTable’s social diary when he visited Lionel Curtis’s family: he ‘was made amember of the family, rooms in Duke St. being put at his disposal and All Soulsbeing thrown open to him’. Curtis also visited the Rose-Innes family in SouthAfrica while Helmuth was there in 1937. Quigley comments, tellingly: ‘Von Moltkekept in touch with both Curtis and Lothian [Kerr] even after the war began in1939 … [and his mention in The Round Table magazine] makes it clear to those whocan read between the lines that Moltke became a member of the Milner Group.’There can be little doubt that Moltke spied for the Round Table when he returnedto Germany, where he signed up as Advisor on International Law to the SupremeCommand of the German Forces (OKW), and eventually headed the resistance groupKreisau Circle (named after his estate in Silesia). But perhaps the most tellingdetail in his story is the fact that his parents were both Christian Scientists.Dorothy Rose-Innes is recognised as one of its leading intellectuals, and shewas involved in the translation of Mary Baker Eddy’s Science and Health intoGerman. She may well have introduced Philip Kerr, with all its traumaticconsequences for him and the Round Table, to Christian Science!‘Round Tablers were among those who conceded Hitler’s territorial claims,’Carroll Quigley affirms. He goes on to suggest that on 5 September 1938, LordHalifax, then a minister in the Chamberlain government, was informed through hisRound Table connections of a plot by the German high command and otherpoliticians to assassinate Hitler if he invaded Czechoslovakia’s Sudetenland andprovoked war with Britain. The plot disintegrated when the German resistancelearnt, on 28 September, that Chamberlain had arrived to negotiate with Hitler,made no great fuss about the Sudetenland, and left brandishing his assurancefrom the Führer that there would be ‘Peace in our time’.Halifax had himself travelled to see Hitler at Berchtesgaden in 1937, presentinghim with a package of essentially Round Table ideas. This was followed up with asimilar visit by Philip Kerr. From all these top-level comings and goings,Hitler’s government was persuaded that Britain regarded Germany as the chiefbulwark against the spread of communism beyond Russia’s borders; that Britainwas prepared to join a Four-Power Pact that included Germany, France and Italy;and that Britain would allow Germany to take over Austria, Czechoslovakia andPoland if this could be done without provoking a war.For this arrangement to work Hitler needed a sympathetic British royal family,and he remained convinced that one was waiting in the wings. On 21 July 1940, aweek before the Duke and Duchess of Windsor were due to leave for the Bahamas,the New York Times broke the startling news that Edward had proposed to hisbrother George VI a Lloyd George–Halifax–Chamberlain ‘peace cabinet’, a plan hewould ‘elaborate on’ when he came to the United States. Hitler and Ribbentropwere further encouraged by a message from the German ambassador in Madridreporting a conversation3 [part0037.html#ch28fn-3] in which Edward is alleged tohave declared ‘he was apparently ready to break with his brother, who wasentirely under the influence of the Queen who was not well disposed to theWindsors’.In the meantime, however, Churchill had sensed the involvement of Germanintelligence. He insisted that the Windsors transfer immediately to Portugal,away from German influence, and arranged forthwith for a warship to transportthem. Then, almost simultaneously, on 17 June, what looked like a mini coupinvolving Halifax against Churchill occurred in England. The Swedish minister inLondon, Björn Prytz, was called to the Foreign Office where Lord Halifax wasstill foreign secretary. Prytz was told by a senior Tory appeaser, R.A.B.Butler, that ‘Churchill did not have the last word’ in the government, and that‘no occasion would be missed to reach a compromise peace [with the Germans] ifreasonable conditions could be obtained’. Halifax added that ‘common sense andnot bravado would govern British policy’.These were extraordinary pronouncements (confirmed in a telegram from Prytz tohis foreign minister Christian Gunther, who, that same day, had had a similarbriefing from the British minister in Stockholm, Sir Victor Mallet). But nothingcame of Halifax’s intervention, and no one ever established what exactly Hitlerhad in mind for the Windsors. Halifax lasted only seven months in the Churchillgovernment before going into genteel exile as British ambassador to Washington,taking up the post vacated by the late Philip Kerr. Churchill’s axe did not stopshort at this point, and Leopold Amery, though no longer an appeaser but still aRound Table man, was dispatched to the India Office in 1940 – the same year thatfound Sir Samuel Hoare in the somewhat obscure posting of Madrid.Adolf Hitler’s new suave former man-about-London and friend of the Mitfords, theSimpsons and the Astors, Joachim von Ribbentrop, decided to take control of thefate of the unhappy, egotistical Windsors once they arrived in Portugal. Heinstructed the German Secret Service to scare the wits out of them, replacinghouse servants with German agents, who were told not to disguise their presence.Senior Spanish ministers, old friends of Edward, warned him that there might beBritish assassination plots against him. Samuel Hoare worked hard to get theWindsors off to Portugal, fearing the increasingly bitter and indiscreet remarksthe Duke was making, often under the influence of whisky.An envoy at the American embassy reported to the ambassador, Alexander Wendell,that Edward had praised Germany for its reorganisation of society, and warnedthat countries not willing to do likewise – specifically Britain and America –‘should avoid dangerous adventures’. Wendell also reported that the Duchess hadgone further, declaring that France had been lost to the Germans because it was‘internally diseased’, and that a country which was ‘not in a condition to fighta war, should not have declared war’. Wendell concluded his report to the StateDepartment with the comment that the Windsors ‘reflected the view of a group inEngland, possibly a growing one, who find in Windsor and his circle a group whoare realists in world politics and who hope to come into their own as thenatural leaders of a peace party’. But Churchill’s threat of a court martialhung heavy over Edward, and he finally packed up for Portugal on 3 July, tellingthe Spanish foreign minister that he would return if the royal family refused torecognise his wife. Ribbentrop was furious, and an aide, Erich Kordt, reported:‘The [Spanish] Embassy has failed us completely in letting him get away.’Ribbentrop cursed himself for not having asked the Spanish government to internthe Duke as a deserting British officer on foreign soil. He then hatched a farmore complex plot, commissioning the services of a young SS agent, WalterSchellenberg, who, in time, would head the German secret intelligence service,the Abwehr. Meanwhile, in Portugal, the Windsors were installed at the Roco deInferno, a remote seaside villa on the cliffs near Estoril that belonged to abanker, Ricardo Espirito Santo Silva, who had strong British and Germanconnections. ‘Mr and Mrs Holy Ghost’ – as one of the Duke’s aides described thebanker and his wife – were almost daily visitors to the Windsors.But the Windsors continued to worry about their possessions and property inFrance, with Edward demanding an important position in Britain and eventuallyissuing an ultimatum that he would not quit his safe haven unless the Queen metthe Duchess. By now Churchill had had enough, and he cabled: ‘Your RoyalHighness has taken active military rank and refusal to obey direct orders ofcompetent military authority would create a serious situation. I hope it willnot be necessary for such orders to be sent. I must strongly urge immediatecompliance of wishes of the Government.’ The ultimatum was clear: the Bahamas –or a court martial.Once again, Ribbentrop decided to put pressure on Edward, though this time hespecified that the Duke and Duchess should remain oblivious of Germaninvolvement. And so, over the next weeks, two clandestine visits were made bySpanish diplomats who were acquainted with the Windsors. In addition toassurances of sanctuary in Spain and the suggestion that the Duke should issue apeace manifesto there, they said that Ribbentrop had confirmed that Britishintelligence now had contingency plans to murder the couple. One of theseenvoys, Don Miguel Primo de Rivera, confided to a friend that, while the Dukehad seemed nervous of committing himself to the peace offer, the ‘Duchess mighthave been quite keen on it’. The Duke, he learnt, had protested to Churchillabout his travel arrangements and had warned he ‘might have to reconsider’ hisposition, since he regarded his banishment to the Bahamas with ‘profound gloomand despondency’.As events unfolded, Sam Hoare warned Churchill: ‘We might be dealing with aspoilt child.’ It was the Spanish ambassador in Lisbon, Don Nicolás Franco yBahamonde, who brought matters to a head. At a dinner party on 24 July, he tolda British diplomat, Lord David Eccles, that the Duke had asked for a visa toSpain ‘for a few days’ – and hinted at a German connection. Eccles flewimmediately from Portugal for a meeting with Churchill on 26 July. The Duke wasdue to leave for the Bahamas four days later. ‘Now came the news that the Dukewas trying to delay his departure,’ writes David Bloch, with the result that‘there was something akin to panic in London on the subject of the Duke ofWindsor’. Churchill kept remarkably cool in his dealings with the wayward Duke,despite his symbolic leadership role among the despised appeasers or, asChurchill referred to them, the defeatists.The ageing though still energetic Churchill – who by now was sixty-six – wasalso profoundly involved in the debate on the federation of the states of India,which for many years had been a Round Table priority. Empire governance hadstarted to collapse in India, and Churchill knew he would soon need thatcountry’s huge army. The Round Table, for its part, was trying to turn theIndian situation to its own advantage. By the mid-1930s the organisation hadalready shifted its focus to the Government of India Bill, a vast piece oflegislation that was the longest ever enacted up till then. Birthed almostentirely through the efforts of Curtis and Kerr, the bill had also enjoyed thelong-term support of Halifax, the Astors, John Buchan, W. Ormsby-Gore – and SirSamuel Hoare, the man the Windsors were now dealing with as the ambassador inSpain.The future of Empire depended on the success of the India Bill – and so, byimplication, did that of the Milner Group and the Round Table. So keen were Kerret al. to get this working example of their ‘federated Empire’ throughParliament, that they and the Elect of the Secret Society broke cover and met inopen conference. ‘A Round Table Conference was called,’ writes Carroll Quigley,‘at which contrary to all expectations, the Indian princes accepted Federation.’Churchill, who loathed the bill and led the opposition to it, used theconference to do a headcount of Round Table members and Round Tablesympathisers, knowing all the major appeasers would feature among thesupporters. In a BBC interview Churchill condemned the bill and all thosesupporting it, while at the same time hinting that it was backed by a sinistersecret society:A monstrous monument of sham built by pygmies … I have watched this story fromits very unfolding, and what has struck me more than anything else has been theamazing small number of people who have managed to carry matters through totheir present lamentable pitch. You could almost count them on the finger of onehand. I have also been struck by the prodigious power of this group … Theirchorus is exceedingly well drilled.Never before had the Round Table been so clearly – and venomously – exposed.When the Government of India Act of 1935 passed to the committee stage it wasdoggedly worked through by the Round Table group led by Samuel Hoare who, at anearlier stage, had answered 5,594 questions over four days before a selectcommittee. Churchill then countered with a three-day session. A series ofclashes ensued, with Churchill this time the underdog. But Churchill was aboutto succeed Chamberlain as prime minister, and many of the Round Table heads wereabout to roll. It was not only the Duke and Duchess of Windsor who would sufferpolitical banishment.* * *As suggested above, Halifax and Kerr’s visits caused Hitler to believe thatBritain regarded Germany as the bulwark against the spread of the RussianRevolution, and that Britain was inclined to a ‘Teutonic’ alliance. Moreover,Halifax had been promoting policies similar to those propounded by the Duke ofWindsor in Spain. Hitler came to a peculiar unwritten agreement with Halifaxwhen they met: while Britain might, in order to calm public opinion, need todeclare war, she would not actually make war. Quigley claims that this strangepolicy was also accepted by Chamberlain and many Round Tablers, though not byeveryone in the inner circle, in particular Bob Brand. It was this same policy,claims Quigley, which resulted in ‘the phony war from September 1939 to April1940’.Churchill, of course, disavowed it all, and made that quite clear to Hitler. Allthe while, however, he put his time to good use, managing to keep ForeignSecretary Halifax and other powerful Round Tablers on side while pondering theirfate as well as that of the Cliveden moot. Churchill was particularly concernedwith the fate of Nancy Astor, the bane of his life in the Commons, though he wasquite probably relishing the end he anticipated for her and her star-crossedfriend Philip Kerr.The extent of the enmity between the two parliamentary factions may be gaugedfrom the quotation Churchill chose to end his speech on the India Act, directedbalefully at Hoare:God save thee, Ancient Mariner.From the fiends that plague thee thusWhy look’st thou so? With my cross-bowI shot the Albatross.4 [part0037.html#ch28fn-4]Whereupon Leo Amery, speaking for the Round Table, shot back: ‘Here endeth thelast chapter of the Book of the Prophet Jeremiah.’Just as history proved Churchill correct in his derision of the notion of afederated India (partition soon followed), he was also right about Hitler’s trueintentions. An astute historian, Churchill clearly saw what Hitler represented,and foresaw the effect of fascism in creating a federated ‘German Europe’. Norwas he going to put up with any more prevarication from ‘the man who would beking’ and ‘That Woman’ – which is how Queen Mary always referred to WallisSimpson. Realising this, Ribbentrop initiated Operation Willi, which was codefor capturing the Duke. Hitler too was growing impatient with the shenanigans inPortugal, and in July 1940 he issued Directive 16, which ended the phony war:Since England despite her militarily hopeless situation, still shows no sign ofwillingness to come to terms, I have decided to prepare a full landing operationagainst England and if necessary carry it out. The aim of the operations is toeliminate the English homeland as a base for carrying on war against Germany,and if it should become necessary to occupy it completely.Ribbentrop persisted with Operation Willi, and had Hitler’s full support,according to Walter Schellenberg,5 [part0037.html#ch28fn-5] the Abwehr agent whoorganised it. Schellenberg was told to offer the Duke fifty million Swiss francs‘if he was ready to make some official gesture disassociating himself frommanoeuvers of the British Royal family’ – and also from ‘that clever Queen’.Schellenberg records the instructions issued to him by Ribbentrop: ‘If theBritish Secret Service should choose to frustrate the Duke in some sucharrangement, then the Fuhrer orders are that you [Schellenberg] are tocircumnavigate the British plans, even at the risk of your life and if needs beby the use of force.’ Ribbentrop went on to explain to him: ‘Hitler attaches thegreatest of importance to this operation, and he has come to the conclusionafter serious consideration that if the Duke should prove hesitant, he himselfwould have no objection to your helping the Duke to reach the right decision bycoercion – even by threats of force if the circumstances make it advisable.’ TheSpanish diplomats were supposed to persuade the Windsors to return to Spain fora few days under the guise of a hunting trip. Once there, they would go intoexile either voluntarily or ‘by coercion’, and await Germany’s victory. Instead,however, the Duke and Duchess sailed secretly for the Bahamas on anunprepossessing ship, the Export Line’s Excalibur.With Edward safely dispatched, Churchill launched an attack on defeatism. In themost famous of three fighting speeches he delivered, the prime minister offeredthe nation nothing but ‘blood, sweat, toil and tears’, promising to fight Hitler‘on the beaches, on the landing grounds and in the fields and streets’. Heassured his countrymen that this would be their ‘finest hour’. Cleverly and withgreat subtlety, he then embarked on a programme that would effectively exile theappeasers. He put them to work, and all their jobs had one feature in common:substantial distance from Britain. In his efforts, Churchill had help from anunlikely source.The appeasers among the Cliveden Set were exposed by Claud Cockburn, a lonejournalist on a crusade. Cockburn was an ardent communist and Cliveden embodiedeverything he opposed: a secret elitist cadre, bourgeois intellectuals who paidlip service to socialism as well as democracy, and grace-and-favour hospitality.Apart from Milner, Lloyd George, Rothschild, Curzon, Churchill, Chamberlain,Balfour and Grey, literary figures like George Orwell and George Bernard Shawwere numbered among Nancy Astor’s ever-expanding ménage, where politics was,however, beginning to overshadow the partying.‘APPEASEMENT,’ yelled the banner headline on Cockburn’s hand-printed broadsheet,The Week. It was aimed at the Cliveden Set, in particular Philip Kerr, thoughwith her distinctly anti-Semitic leanings, Nancy Astor was an obvious targettoo. Cockburn’s scoop was the revelation that Philip Kerr had been holdingsecret talks with Hitler.By now Cliveden had become Kerr’s second home, the place where he practised hisChristian Science with Nancy Astor. He was a great help with the family,supporting Nancy’s daughter Phyllis (‘Wissie’) over her mother’s objections tothe conventional medical treatment Wissie was given after a debilitatinghorse-riding accident. Kerr also took on the task of informing Nancy thatBobbie, her son from her previous marriage, had been arrested for engaging inhomosexual acts. Moreover, he was at Nancy’s side when she took theparliamentary seat in Plymouth.Kerr was now also the Round Table’s senior spokesman on Germany – a role he hadoccupied since the early 1930s when Round Table policy first began to condemnGermany for threatening world peace. However, Kerr’s attitude to Hitler becameincreasingly enthusiastic and he was soon having bitter rows with other leadingRound Tablers, including Nancy’s brother-in-law Bob Brand. Kerr held thatBritain was being irresponsible in not talking peace with Hitler – a viewessentially shared by Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, who has since becomethe scapegoat for British appeasement, and remains so long after the ClivedenSet has been forgotten.6 [part0037.html#ch28fn-6]Though continually concerned to advance the Round Table’s work of defending theEmpire, and despite his awareness that war would lead to German colonialexpansion, Kerr was convinced Hitler could be bought off by allowing himcontested territory like the Sudetenland and the Rhineland. After the second ofhis visits to Hitler, Kerr returned to Nancy Astor, bearing Hitler’s red andblack swastika as a goodwill gift! Hitler’s present caused an early rift betweenNancy and her English family, as well as between two powerful leaders of theRound Table. Bob Brand, one of the Round Table elite and also a Europeaneconomic expert who had never trusted Hitler, refused to remain in the same roomas the Nazi flag. The row estranged Nancy from her sister Phyllis, who wasmarried to Bob, until Phyllis’s death some six months later.Despite all this, Kerr persuaded the Astors to meet the German ambassadorRibbentrop, who visited St James Square, and then had a second meeting at theirhouse in Sandwich. Claud Cockburn kept the gossip mills going by implying thatKerr and the Round Table were not only manipulating politics, but selling out tothe Germans. Nancy Astor tried to play down the Ribbentrop meetings, claimingthat whenever he gave a Nazi salute she told him ‘not to be silly’. Ribbentropobviously did not see their meetings in the same light: years later, when he wastried at Nuremberg for war crimes, he called on the Astors to be defencewitnesses. They refused.When questioned in Parliament about her contact with Hitler, Nancy Astor claimedthat she supported German rearmament because Germany was surrounded by ‘Catholiccountries’. Sir Stafford Cripps, the leader of the Labour Party, called her the‘Honourable Member for Berlin’, while Tory spokesman Harold Nicolson applaudedher for ‘working hard for Hitler and Mussolini’. A French newspaper called theCliveden Set les Cagoulards – the Hooded Ones – thereby coming closer to thetruth than all the appeasement allegations. Despite these political gaffes, itwas only in 1945 that Nancy Astor was persuaded to give up the Plymouth seat.Milner was an occasional visitor to Cliveden in the early days, though hispresence went largely unnoticed. He would surely have been aware of the deepwater Kerr was getting himself into, yet he apparently did nothing to dissuadehim. It is very possible that he had already seen the writing on the wall forPhilip Kerr after the latter’s espousal of Christian Science and his infatuationwith Nancy Astor, who seemed clearly doomed. In the event, Milner had anotherRound Table heir waiting in the wings. Carroll Quigley gives a rare summary ofthe web that was the Round Table in the first half of the twentieth century:The Round Table was the most powerful single influence in All Souls, Balliol,and New Colleges at Oxford. It controlled The Times for more than fifty years,with the exception of the three years 1919–1922. It publicized the idea of andthe name ‘British Commonwealth of Nations’ in the period 1908–1918. It was thechief influence in Lloyd George’s war administration in 1917–1919 and dominatedthe British delegation to the Peace Conference of 1919. It had a great deal todo with the formation and management of the League of Nations and of the systemof mandates. It founded the Royal Institute of International Affairs in 1919.7[part0037.html#ch28fn-7] It was one of the chief influences on British policytoward Ireland, Palestine, and India in the period 1917–1945. It was a veryimportant influence on the policy of appeasement of Germany during the years1920–1940.The appeasement scandal spread to the American press after Nancy Astor toldinterviewers that the Jews in Germany needed ‘to take heed’. She also expressedadmiration for Hitler’s abstemiousness in an article in Time and Tide; and wroteto Prime Minister Baldwin saying she ‘wholeheartedly supported’ Hitler in hisbelligerent Rhineland policy. In Nancy’s defence, it should be acknowledged thatfrom 1918 to 1920 the British press was openly anti-Semitic following events inthe Russian Revolution. Newspapers, including The Times, began to print articleswarning of ‘Bolshies’, identifying Jews – Trotsky, Béla Kun, Rosa Luxemburg andKarl Marx – as being at the heart of Bolshevism, and supporting the WhiteRussian8 [part0037.html#ch28fn-8] cause against Bolshevik communists.For Winston Churchill, Nancy Astor was a gift from heaven. It was about thistime that she came out with her gibe – that if she were married to Churchill shewould poison his tea. Churchill, by far the better wordsmith, replied: if hewere married to her, he’d drink it.With Kerr ever more deeply committed to Christian Science and Nancy Astor, andLionel Curtis ever more tediously obsessing about Empire, Milner had alreadybegun to look elsewhere for a successor who was not only clever but alsopassionately committed. Leopold Amery was the obvious candidate. Born in Indiato an English father and a Hungarian Jewish mother, he returned to England as achild with his mother. He entered Balliol College in 1892, studying languagesand political economy. After becoming a Fellow at All Souls, he became ajournalist for The Times in 1898. Amery was fluent in seven European languages,and it was while reporting on the Boer War that he was recruited by Milner. Hesoon became known as Milner’s mouthpiece.Cecil Rhodes invited Amery to dinner, and over a long evening he discussed withhis guest the Rhodes Trust and the establishment of a scholarship fund at Oxfordthat would recruit talented young men from the British dominions, Germany, andespecially the United States, to encourage American support for an Empirefederation. His son Julian has confirmed he saw British imperialism as an‘ideology’ and ‘a faith’.Carroll Quigley is similarly unequivocal on the subject of Amery’s relationshipwith Milner, which was extremely close not only politically, but alsopersonally:Amery can be regarded as Milner’s political heir. From the beginning of his ownpolitical career in 1906 to the death of Milner in 1925, he was more closelyassociated with Milner’s active political life than any other person … hisassociations with Milner became steadily more intimate. In his last years ofpublic office, Milner was generally assisted by Amery (1917–1921), and when hedied it was Amery who arranged the public memorial service and controlled thedistribution of tickets.Milner’s demise was bizarre, and is worth recounting. When the great powerbroker retired from government in 1921, Stanley Baldwin appointed him chair of acommittee to re-examine the case for imperial preferences – Round Table work tothe last! Four years later, while on Rhodes Trust business in South Africa, hewas bitten by a tsetse fly. Soon afterwards he died of sleeping sickness – amore ironic end for a man as driven as Milner it would be hard to imagine.But to return to Amery: it became clear that his contact with Hitler rivalledeven that of Kerr, to the extent that the Führer may have perceived Amery as theRound Table’s new general. But there was a significant difference: Amery wasnever taken in by Hitler, and he appears to have had a more mature appreciationthan either Kerr or Curtis of where the Anglo-American alliance might lead.In 1919 Milner appointed Amery to the board of the Rhodes Trust. In 1925, whenAmery was stepping into Milner’s shoes, certain diary entries support thesuggestion that his was the dominant voice at Round Table cabals. In May 1937,for example, when Philip Kerr had just met with Hitler, Amery notes thefollowing:RIIA Garden Party in St. James Square … Lothian [Kerr] told me all about recentinterviews with Hitler and Göring, describing the former as essentially aprophet and the latter as a genial buccaneer of the F.E. type. He says theGermans are very anxious to be friends with us if they can but that if we allowthings to drift … they will solve it by force, in which case we are likely toclimb down ignominiously.What is less well known – though again revealed by Amery’s diaries – is thatduring the 1930s, as a member of the board of various British and German metalcompanies, Amery travelled extensively in Germany and monitored its rearmament.In August 1935, two months after the signing of the British–German navalagreement that allowed Germany to rebuild its navy, Amery met with Hitler andgave him advice on how to strengthen the German economy. Though extensive,Amery’s revealing diary entry of 13 August is worth recounting:At 10.45 the big open car, familiar to cinema visitors, arrived and K., myselfand Dr. Schmidt, another expert from von Ribbentrop’s office … drove throughBerchtesgaden up the winding road to Obersalzberg … We were welcomed by a burlybrown shirt ADC, like a jollier Göring, and then taken on to a veranda whereHitler met us and took us in to a room opening out on to it. He didn’t wastemuch time on compliments but got on to high politics at once. What I was chieflyinterested in was his outlook on the European problem generally. On this hetalked what seemed to me vigorous common sense …We talked – though it was about ten to one – for over an hour and a half. I didnot find the hypnotic charm I had heard of, and no attempt to exercise it, butliked his directness and eagerness to let his hearer know all his mind.Intellectually he has a grip on economic essentials and on many political ones,too, even if it is crude at times and coloured by deep personal prejudice … Hisimmediate surroundings, like K. regard him as a universal genius as well as anational saviour. It will be interesting to see how he shapes in the next 20years, if he lasts, and there is no particular reason why he shouldn’t.He over-works and under-sleeps, but as he leads an extraordinarily ascetic lifehe may stand more of that than most. We got on well together I think, owing tothe fundamental similarity of many of our ideas. But I admit we didn’t discusssome controversial subjects like Austria, constitutional liberty, Jews, orcolonies. I did, however, expound to him my view that Germany should enter intopreferential schemes with Holland and Belgium in regard to their colonies.Reading between the lines of this diary entry, two extraordinary possibilitiesemerge: first, Amery and Kerr (assuming that ‘K’ denotes Kerr) were received byHitler as if they were government ministers; and second, Amery seems to be theone in charge. Significantly, they all got on so well with Hitler ‘owing to thefundamental similarity of so many of [their] ideas’. Also, the whole encounterwas more than a little sycophantic in that they avoided contentious matters suchas ‘Jews’. Moreover, neither Amery nor Kerr had any official status at the time:Amery had been left out of the cabinet and Kerr did not represent the electedhouse at all.* * *When, after the Munich debacle, Amery famously attacked Chamberlain, he quotedOliver Cromwell: ‘You have sat too long here for any good you have been doing.Depart, I say, and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go!’ But thefact remains that the Round Table had better contacts with Hitler and hisministers than the British government. And so, when Amery assailed Chamberlain,the inference may be drawn that he was hoping for a Halifax premiership. If thiswas indeed the case, it is yet another example of Secret Society manipulationwhich by pure chance failed at the final hurdle.It could be claimed that there were in fact two ‘governments’ operating inBritain in the mid-1930s – as had been the case in 1918, with the Garden Suburb.One was the fractious, very fragile ‘democracy’ overseen by Neville Chamberlain,with the other being the Round Table operating partly through the politicalpowerhouse that was the Cliveden moot. Indeed, no other clandestine group inBritish history negotiated with the country’s enemies in the manner of thisRound Table elite. Claud Cockburn, who was pilloried for gutter-presssensationalism, may well have been correct in identifying an appeasementgovernment-in-waiting.It was onto this political battlefield that Churchill – regarded as a warmongerby many Round Tablers – exploded. Shaken by the bellicose speeches blasting fromthe BBC, Hitler speedily abandoned the sham of a Teutonic alliance, just as hehad abandoned his promise that the gift of the Sudetenland would ransom Poland.Cliveden proved not to have been a cohesive political force after all – indeed,the Round Table, and its shiniest knight Philip Kerr, were beginning toself-destruct.Churchill, displaying a single-minded aggressiveness that few shared, grabbedhis chance, saw them all off, eventually brought America into the war, andfinally, against all the odds, achieved victory. The two toughest jobs, defenceand the Treasury, Churchill himself took on, combating the ‘black dog’nightmares of the many military defeats on a regimen of afternoon naps,arrogance, experience, and what for everyone else (barring Rhodes) would havebeen far too much whisky and champagne. Winston Churchill had complete controlof the war. Cometh the hour, cometh the man!"},{"pageContent":"EpilogueThe star of Nancy and Waldorf Astor would never again be in the ascendant,whether socially or politically. After 1945, Nancy became the subject of muchderision and was persuaded by Waldorf not to stand in the election – which alsoremoved Churchill from power. It was the end of an era, and of the Clivedendynasty.Was this the end, too, of Rhodes’s evolved Secret Society? Quite the contrary,in fact: Rhodes and Milner had ensured their own immortality, and those knightswho were able – Amery, in particular – eventually rode back into the lists.Post-war, these Round Tablers found themselves facing what many had alwaysfeared – a fear first expressed by Regy Brett: an America toughened by war, witha president determined to ensure that some of the spoils went to the victor. Andthen there was a destitute Europe. Amery had anticipated most of this, however,and was prepared for the challenge. As early as January 1941, Amery had writtena private letter to the viceroy of India, Lord Linlithgow, warning thatRoosevelt’s secretary of state, Cordell Hull, ‘really representsmid-nineteenth-century vision on economics, coupled no doubt with the desire tocreate an American export hegemony in the world’. And the following year, inAugust 1942, Amery wrote to Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, secretary of state for thecolonies:Smashing Hitler is only a means to the essential end of preserving the BritishEmpire and all it stands for in the World … It will be no consolation to suggestthat Hitler should be replaced by Stalin, Chiang Kai-Shek or even an AmericanPresident if we cease to exercise our power and influence in the world. What Ithink is needed to-day more than anything else is a vigorous reaffirmation ofour faith in our destiny as an Empire … regarding the war merely as a step inthat process.The Secret Society was still on the march, with Amery carrying its banner. Afterthe war, Amery continued to write prodigiously, rallying the public behind theEmpire. In his 1946 study, The Washington Loan Agreements: A Critical Study ofAmerican Economic Foreign Policy, he contended that Roosevelt’s New Dealersmight use the Bretton Woods agreements and the terms of the British war debt tothe United States as a means to dismantle the British Empire. Amery issued aclear warning: ‘The object of American policy is perfectly simple. It is toclamp upon the world, and in particular upon the British Empire, the obsoleteeconomic system of the last century.’Eventually, factors beyond his control ultimately destroyed Leopold Amery’scareer – recalling Rhodes and the Jameson Raid, Milner and Chamberlain’s stroke,Kerr’s seduction by Nancy Astor and Hitler, and Halifax finding he had nostomach for the job of prime minister. Was the Secret Society finally cursed byendemic bad luck? Amery’s elder son John was exposed as an outspoken Nazisympathiser who had made propaganda broadcasts from Germany, inducing someBritish prisoners of war to join the German-controlled ‘British Free Corps’. Inspite of frantic efforts by his family, John Amery was hanged for treason in1945. The sins of this son should not have been visited upon so visionary afather, but sadly they were.The remnants of the Round Table elite retired, with most occupying positions inorganisations founded by Rhodes, which, largely unnoticed, had gone fromstrength to strength during the war. Leopold Amery, who had joined the RhodesTrust in 1933, ran its affairs until his death in 1955. During that entiretwenty-two-year period, Amery missed but one meeting of the trust. Waldorf Astorchaired the Round Table from 1935 until his death in 1945, overseeing itsmetamorphosis to the more benign charity we know today.The Rhodes Trust still occupies the grand meeting hall and library in theHerbert Baker building in Oxford, and each year a new batch of Rhodes Scholarsarrives. When they leave, these young men and women go on to make their mark onthe world, just as their 7,000 or so predecessors have done since 1902. Thespirit of Rhodes and Milner lives on also in the RIIA – Chatham House – and itssister organisation in America, the Council on Foreign Relations. Today, theseare two of the most influential discussion forums on earth. Rhodes’s reputationmay have crumbled somewhat as attitudes to imperialism have changed. But hisfortune, thanks to Milner, turns out to have been very well invested: ‘theRhodes’ remains the world’s leading scholarship, and the RIIA is the leadingindependent political forum.* * *How does one end a story which appears to have no end? It is likely that RhodesScholars will still be beavering away a thousand years from now, and there isevery chance that among them will be many members of Parliament, prime ministersand presidents. Rhodes’s Secret Society has achieved an immortality whichoutlives its old Elect. Alfred Milner, W.T. Stead, Regy Brett, Philip Kerr,Lionel Curtis and Leo Amery have all slipped off to quiet cemeteries – the onlyburial sites I am certain of are Stead’s watery grave1 [part0037.html#fn-1] andRhodes’s rocky tomb, alongside his best friend and loyal foot soldier LeanderStarr Jameson.When I visited the Matopos in 2013, unable to declare myself a British writerand posing instead as a tourist, I lay on the great brass slab atop Rhodes’stomb. I turned to a group of Zimbabwe schoolchildren and invited them to do thesame, listening as Rhodes turned in his grave. A few of them put their earsagainst the metal, giggling as they did so. Their teachers gaped in amazement atthe old white guy so fearless of Cecil Rhodes.Yet the experience resurrected my own past when I returned to England to startthis book in 1990. I had bought a house in Eydon village, Northamptonshire, tobe closer to the editing facilities I needed for my television series NatureWatch. Walking in the pretty churchyard one day, I spotted memorials to theBaron Brand and his wife Phyllis. Bob Brand and Phyllis Brand née Langhorne,sister of Nancy Astor, had owned Eydon Hall for more than thirty years. PhyllisBrand had bought it on the basis of its reputation for local hunting when sheand her sister first came to England – American huntresses in search of newhusbands.Completely unbeknown to me until then, Eydon Hall had been a regular, albeitoccasional, meeting place for the Round Table elite. It saw visitors like JanSmuts who, together with Kindergartener Bob Brand, worked out the draftconstitution of the Union of South Africa, and who later returned to England toadvise Milner and the Lloyd George war cabinets. By pure coincidence I wasliving in a minor moot! Baron Brand, alongside John Maynard Keynes, would becomea key economist in Europe, and the most vociferous critics of the reparationterms imposed on Germany.A similar epiphany occurred when I was browsing around the war memorial rotundaat Rhodes House in Oxford and came across the names of two Germans: Count JohannHeinrich von Bernstorff and Adam von Trott. This struck me as odd, since noRhodes Scholarships had been awarded in Germany during either of the world wars.But it turned out that Von Trott and Von Bernstorff had been awarded theirscholarships before the war. More to the point, the names provided irrefutableevidence that ‘the Rhodes’ had never been the politically neutral teachingprogramme its public image suggests. In the pre-war years, together with a groupof Round Tablers who were also Fellows of All Souls, three Rhodes Scholars hadbeen actively engaged in the German resistance organisation I had come acrossearlier in my research. The plot also involved the British Secret Service andthe head of the German army intelligence network, the Abwehr.Adam von Trott zu Solz, son of a German proconsul, arrived in Oxford in 1931 ona Rhodes Scholarship. He became a close friend of Lord David Astor, son ofWaldorf Astor. During the next few years he used the contacts he made at Oxfordand Cliveden, which included some American Rhodes Scholars, to warn of the Nazithreat. Von Trott made three secret visits to London to meet Philip Kerr andgain support for an internal resistance movement against the Nazis, but theCliveden appeasers were not convinced. So Von Trott bravely returned to Germanyto join the Kreisau Circle.The Kreisau Circle was then a German equivalent of the Round Table: its coremembership was intellectual, supported by rich aristocrats and Prussiannationalists who despised Hitler. Though the Kreisau Circle never actuallymooted the overthrow of the Hitler regime, it became increasingly involved inspying operations, with Von Trott himself joining the Nazi Party in 1940 as aspy. Events soon escalated, and Von Trott was one of the leaders of ColonelClaus von Stauffenberg’s plot of 20 July 1944 to assassinate Hitler. Sentencedto death on 15 August 1944, Von Trott was hanged on 26 August. His wife wasimprisoned and their children put up for adoption, though she recovered them ayear later when the war ended.Two other German Rhodes Scholars, Albrecht von Bernstorff and Erich Vermehren,continued to operate in various clandestine activities. Vermehren was preventedfrom taking up his Rhodes Scholarship in 1938 (Bernstorff had sat on hisselection board) because he refused to join the Hitler Youth and was thusforbidden to leave Germany.2 [part0037.html#fn-2] Vermehren then became a covertassociate of Von Trott’s Kreisau Circle and another anti-Nazi group known as theFrau Solf Tea Party. With the Gestapo becoming suspicious of his activities,Vermehren managed to get himself assigned to the Istanbul branch of the Abwehr,under Admiral Wilhelm Canaris. He also arranged for his wife to follow him,despite the Gestapo’s efforts to detain her as a hostage in Germany. When, soonafterwards, members of the Tea Party were arrested, the Gestapo summoned theVermehrens to Berlin. Knowing what awaited them, they contacted the BritishSecret Intelligence Service in February 1944, and were flown to Cairo and thenceto England. When, via British intelligence, news of the Vermehrens’ defection tothe UK broke, Hitler immediately put out an order for the Abwehr to bedissolved. The result was an intelligence coup for Britain, for the Germansincorrectly assumed that their secret intelligence codes had been compromised.The story of these young Germans is clear evidence that Rhodes Scholars have inthe past and, indeed, continue to participate actively in politics. A famousexample is Bill Clinton, who worked to establish peace3 [part0037.html#fn-3] inan area where Rhodes, Milner and the Round Table had failed: brokering peace inNorthern Ireland, and thereby consolidating the Empire. It may not be too high ahope that Rhodes Scholars will continue to subscribe to the broad principles ofRhodes’s Confession of Faith, and that, however these principles are redefinedin a changing world, the ultimate goal will remain that ever-elusive andoft-mocked grail, ‘world peace’.Though the road is ever rocky, the pursuit of this grail will undoubtedly enjoydramatic successes and well-publicised falls. In 2015, in a gesture that hadworldwide repercussions, the vice-chancellor of the University of Cape Town, MaxPrice – himself a Rhodes Scholar – was persuaded to take down a statue of Rhodesafter it was befouled by a student protesting against colonial symbols.4[part0037.html#fn-4]Despite setbacks, the success stories continue to prevail, with a particularlyencouraging story being the expansion of the Rhodes Scholarships programme intoChina. This promises to be the biggest – and most significant – expansion of thescholarship since 1970, when women first became eligible.5 [part0037.html#fn-5]* * *Once upon a time, most British people of the administrative class – Rhodes andMilner’s class – believed, as Leopold Amery so succinctly put it to the RoundTable, that ‘The Empire is not external to any of the British nation, it issomething like the Kingdom of Heaven within ourselves.’ This viewpoint gave riseto a single-minded, unrepentant mission of benevolence – which in some quarterstoday is, however, viewed as malevolence. Yet it remains Cecil Rhodes’s truelegacy, and the Rhodes Trust has the complex task of ensuring that this missionremains relevant.While I was writing this book – before the Rhodes Must Fall movement gainedmomentum – my eye was caught by an item on the Rhodes Scholarship programmewebsite. It confirmed that in Nelson Mandela’s uneasy Rainbow Nation, goodthings still were happening, and, more important, that plans were being made toensure they continued into the future.The Cape Town-Oxford SwapAs the Trustees of the Mandela Rhodes Foundation arrive in Oxford today fortheir annual meeting, 18 current Scholars are heading to South Africa for a tourwhich will include meetings with Archbishop Desmond Tutu and with Mandela RhodesScholars at the Mandela Rhodes building in Cape Town.The Mandela Rhodes Foundation offers scholarships to African studentsundertaking postgraduate study in South African universities.
