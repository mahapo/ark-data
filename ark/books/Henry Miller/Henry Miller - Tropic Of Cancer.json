Last night Boris discovered that he was lousy. I had to shave his armpits and even then the itching did not stop. How can one get lousy in a beautifu l place like this? But no matter. We might never have known each other so intimately, Boris and I, had it not been for the lice. Boris has just given me a summary of his views. He is a weather prophet. The weather will continue bad, he says. There will be more calamities, more death, more despair . Not the slight est indication of a chang e anywhere. The cancer of time is eating us away. Our heroes have killed themselves, or are killing themselves. The hero, then, is not Time, but Timelessnes s. We must get in step, a lock step, toward the prison of death. There is no e scape. The weather will not chang e. It is now the fall of my second year in Paris. I was sent here for a reason I have not yet been able to fatho m. I have no money, no resources, no hopes. I am the happiest man alive. A year ago, six months ago, I thought that I was an artist. I no longer think about it, I am. Everything that was literature has fallen from me. There are no more books to be written, thank God. This then? This is not a book. This is libel, slander , defamation of charac ter. This is not a book, in the ordinar y sense of the word. No, this is a prolonged insult, a gob of s pit in the face of Art, a kick in the pants to God, Man, Destin y, Time, Love, Beaut y ... what you will. I am going to sing for you, a little off key perhaps, but I will sing. I will sing while you croak, I will dance over your dirty corpse... To sing you must first open your mouth. You must have a pair of lungs, and a little knowledge of music. It is not necessar y to have an accord ion, or a guitar. The essenti al thing is to want to sing. This then is a song. I a m singing. It is to you, Tania, that I am singing. I wish that I could sing better, more melodiousl y, but then perhaps you would never have consented to listen to me. You have heard the others sing and they have left you cold. They sang too beautifully, or not beautifu lly enough. It is the twent y - something th of October . I no longer keep track of the date. Would you say – my dream of the 14th November last? There are intervals, but they are between dreams, and there is no consciousness of them left. The world around me is dissolving, leaving here and there spots of time. The world is a cancer eating itself away... I am thinking that when the great silence descends upon all and everywher e music will at last triumph. When into the womb of time everything is again withdrawn chaos will be restored and chaos is the score upon which reality is written. You, Tania, are my chaos. It is why I sing. It is not even I, it is the world dying, shedding the skin of time. I am still alive, kicking in your wom b, a rea lity to write upon. Dozing off. The physiology of love. The whale with his six - foot penis, in repose. The bat – penis lib re. Animals with a bone in the penis. Hence, a bone on ... \"Happil y,\" says Gourmont, \"the bony structure is lost in man.\" Happil y? Yes, happil y. Think of the human race walking around with a bone on. The kangaroo has a double penis – one for"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"weekda ys and one for holidays. Dozing. A letter from a female asking if I have found a title for m y book. Title? To be sure: \"Love ly Lesbians.\" Your anecdo tal life! A phrase of M. Borowski' s. It is on Wednesda ys that I have lunch with Borowski. His wife, who is a dried - up cow, officiates. She is studying English now – her favorit e word is \"filthy.\" You can see immediately what a pain in the ass the Borowskis are. But wait ... Borowski wears corduro y suits and plays the accordion. An invinc ible combination, especia lly when you consider that he is not a bad artist. He puts on that he is a Pole, but he is not, of course. He is a Jew, Borow ski, and his father was a philat elist. In fact, almost all Montparn asse is Jewish, or half - Jewish, which is worse. There's Carl and Paula, and Cronstadt and Boris, and Tania and Sylvester, and Moldorf and Lucil le. All except Fillmore. Henr y Jordan Oswald turned out to be a Jew also. Louis Nichols is a Jew. Even Van Norden and Chéri e are Jewish. Frances Blake is a Jew, or a Jewess. Titus is a Jew. The Jews then are snowing me under . I am writing this for my friend Carl whose fath er is a Jew . All this is i mpor tant to understand. Of them all the loveliest Jew is Tania, and for her sake I too would become a Jew. Why not? I already speak like a Jew. And I am as ugly as a Jew. Besides, who hates the Jews m ore than the Jew? Twilight hour. Indian blue, water of glass, trees glistening and liquescen t. The rails fall away into the canal at Jaurès. The long caterpillar with lacqu ered sides dips like a roller coaster . It is not Paris. It is not Cone y Island. It is a crepuscu lar melange of all the cities of Europe and Central America. The railroad yards below me, the tracks black, webb y, not ordered by the engineer but cataclysmic in design, like those gaunt fissures in the polar ic e which the camera regist ers in degrees of black. Food is one of the things I enjoy tremendousl y. And in this beautiful Villa Borghese there is scarcel y ever any evidenc e of food. It is positive ly appall ing at times. I have asked Boris time and again to order bread for breakf ast, but he always forgets. He goes out for breakfast, it seems. And when he comes back he is picking his teeth and there is a little egg hanging from his goate e. He eats in the restauran t out of considera tion for me. He sa ys it hurts to eat a big m eal and have m e watch hi m. I like Van Norden but I do not share his opinion of himself. I do not agree, for instance, that he is a philosophe r, or a think er. He is cunt - struck, that's all. And he will never be a write r. Nor will Sylvester ever be a writer, though his name blaze in 50,000- candle- power red lights. The only writers about me for whom I have any respect, at present, are Carl and Boris. They are possessed. They glow inwardl y with a white flame. They are mad and tone deaf. They are sufferers. Moldorf, on the other hand, who suffers too in his pecul iar way, is not mad. Moldorf is word drunk. He has no veins or blood vessels, no heart or kidne ys. He is a portable trunk filled with innum erable drawers and in the drawers are labels written out in white ink, brown ink, red ink, blue ink, vermilion, saffron, mauve, sienna, apricot, turquo ise, onyx, Anjou, herring, Corona, verdigr is, gor gonzola... I have moved the typewr iter into the next room where I can see myself in the mirror as I w rite. Tania is l ike Irène. She expects fat le tters. But there is another Tania, a Tania like a big seed who scatters pollen everywhere – or, let us say, a little bit of Tolstoy, a stable scene"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"in which the fetus is dug up. Tania is a fever , too – les voies urinair es, Café de la Liber té, Place des Vosges, bright neckti es on the Boulevard Montparnasse, dark bathroo ms, Porto Sec, Abdull ah cigare ttes, the adagio sonata Pathé tique, aural amplificators, anecdota l seances, burnt sienna breasts, heavy garters, what time is it, golden pheasants stuffed with chestnu ts, taffeta fingers, vaporish twilights turning to ilex, acromegaly, cancer and delirium, warm veils, poker chips, carpets of blood and soft thighs. Tania says so that every one may hear: \"I love him!\" And while Boris scalds himself with whisk y she says: \"Sit down here! O Boris ... Russia ... what'll I do? I'm bursting with i t!\" At night when I look at Boris' goate e lying on the pillow I get hysterical. O Tania, where now is that warm cunt of yours, those fat, heavy garters, those soft, bulging thighs ? There is a bone in my prick six inches long. I will ream out every wrinkle in your cunt, Tania, big with seed. I will send you home to your Sylvester with an ache in your belly and your womb turned inside out. Your Sylvester! Yes, he knows how to build a fire, but I know how to inflame a cunt. I shoot hot bolts into you, Tania, I make your ovari es incandescent. Your Sylvester is a little jealous now? He feels something, does he? He feels the remnants of my big prick. I have set the shores a little wider . I have ironed out the wrinkles. After me you can take on stallions, bulls, rams, drakes, St. Bernards. You can stuff toads, bats, lizards up your rectum. You can shit arpeggios if you like, or string a zither across your navel. I am fucking you, Tania, so that you'll stay fucked. And if you are afraid of being fucked publicl y I will fuck you priva tely. I will tear off a few hairs from your cunt and paste them on Boris' chin. I will bite into your clitoris and spit out two franc pi eces... Indigo sky swept clear of fleecy clouds, gaunt trees infinitely extend ed, their black bough s gesticulating like a sleepwalke r. Som ber, spectral trees, their trunks pale as cigar ash. A silence supreme and altoge ther European. Shutters drawn, shops barred. A red glow here and there to mark a tryst. Brusque the facades, almost forbidding; immaculate except for the splotches of shadow cast by the trees. Passing by the Orangerie I am reminded of another Paris, the Paris of Maugham , of Gauguin, Paris of George Moore. I think of that terrible Spaniard who was then startling the world with his acrob atic leaps from style to style. I think of Spengler and of his terrible pronuncia mentos, and I wonder if style, style in the grand manner, is done for. I say that my mind is occupied with these thoughts, but it is not true; it is only later, after I have crossed the Seine, after I have put behind me the carnival of lights, that I allow my mind to play with these ideas. For the moment I can think of nothing – except that I am a sentient being stabbed by the miracle of these waters that reflec t a forgotten world. All along the banks the trees lean heavi ly over the tarnished mirror; when the wind rises and fills them with a rustling murmur they will shed a few tears and shiver as the water swirls by. I am suffocated by it. No one to whom I can communicate even a fract ion of m y feelings... The troubl e with Irène is that she has a valise instead of a cunt. She wants fa t letters to shove in her valise. Immense, avec des choses inouïes. Llona now, she had a cunt. I know because she sent us some hairs from down below. Llona – a wild ass snuffing pleasure out of the wind. On every high hill she played the harlo t – and sometimes in telephon e booths and toilets. She bought a bed for King Carol and a shaving mug with his initials on it. She lay in Tottenham Court Road with her dress pulled up and fingered herself. She used candles, Roman candl es, and door knobs. Not a prick in the land big"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"enough for her ... not one. Men went inside her and curled up. She wanted extension pricks, self - exploding rocke ts, hot boiling oil made of wax and creosote. She would cut off your prick and keep it inside her foreve r, if you gave her perm ission. One cunt out of a million, Llona! A labora tory cunt and no litmus paper that could take her color. She was a liar, too, this Llona. She never bought a bed for her King Carol. She crowned him with a whisk y bottle and her tongue was full of lice and tomorrows. Poor Carol, he could only curl up inside her and die. She drew a breath and he fell out – like a dead clam. Enorm ous, fat letters, avec des choses inouï es. A valise without straps. A hole withou t a key. She had a Germ an mouth, French ears, Russian ass. Cunt internat ional. When the flag waved it was red all the way back to the throa t. You entered on the Boulevard Jules - Ferry and came out at the Porte de la Villette. You dropped your sweetbr eads into the tumbrils – red tumbrils with two wheels, natura lly. At the conflu ence of the Ourcq and Marne, where the water sluices through the dikes and lies like glass under the bridges. Llona is lying there now and the canal is full of glass and splinters; the mimosas weep, and there is a wet, foggy fart on the windowpanes. One cunt out of a million Llona! All cunt and a glass ass in which you can read the histor y of the Middle Ages. It is the caricatur e of a man which Moldorf first presents. Thyroid eyes. Miche lin lips. Voice like pea soup. Under his vest he carr ies a little pear. However you look at him it is always the same panoram a: netsuke snuffbox, ivory handl e, chess piece, fan, temple motif. He has fermented so long now that he is amorphous. Yeast despoiled of its vitamins. Vase withou t a rubber plant. The females were sired twice in the ninth century, and again during the Renaissance. He was carried through the great dispersions under yellow bellies and white. Long before the Exodus a Tatar spat in his blood. His dilemma is that of the dwarf. With his pinea l eye he sees his silhoue tte projected on a screen of incommensurab le size. His voice, synchroniz ed to the shadow of a pinhead, intoxic ates hi m. He hears a roar where others hear only a squeak. There is his mind. It is an amphitheater in which the actor gives a protean perform ance. Moldorf, multiform and unerring, goes through his roles – clown, juggler , contort ionist, priest, lecher, mountebank. The amphitheater is too small. He puts dynamite to it. The audience is drugged. He scotches it. I am trying ineffectually to approach Moldorf. It is like trying to approach God, for Moldorf is God – he has never been anything else. I a m merely putting down words... I have had opinions about him which I have discarded; I have had other opinions which I am revising. I have pinned him down only to find that it was not a dung - beetle I had in my hands, but a dragonfl y. He has offended me by his coarseness and then overwhel med me with his delicacy. He has been voluble to the point of suffocation, then quiet as the Jordan. When I see him trotting forward to greet me, his little paws outstretched, his eyes perspiring, I fee l that I am meeting... No, this is not the wa y to go about it! \"Comme un œuf dan sant sur un jet d'eau.\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"He has only one cane – a mediocr e one. In his pocke t scraps of paper contain ing prescriptions for Weltschmerz. He is cured now, and the little Germ an girl who washed his feet is breaking her heart. It is like Mr. Nonentit y toting his Gujarat i dictionar y everywhere. \"Inev itable for everyone \" – meaning, no doubt, indispensabl e. Borowski would find all this incomprehensib le. Borow ski has a differen t cane for each day in the week, and one for E aster. We have so many points in common that it is like looking at myself in a cracked mirror. I have been looking over my manuscrip ts, pages scrawled with revisions. Pages of literatu re. This frightens me a little. It is so much like Moldorf. Onl y I am a Gentile, and Gentiles have a different way of suffering. They suffer without neuroses and, as Sylvester, says a man who has never been afflicted with a neurosis does not know the meaning of su ffering. I recall distin ctly how I enjoyed my suffering. It was like taking a cub to bed with you. Once in a while he clawed you – and then you really were fright ened. Ordinaril y you had no fear – you could alwa ys turn him loose, or chop his head of f. There are people who cannot resist the desire to get into a cage with wild beasts and be mangled. They go in even withou t revolver or whip. Fear makes them fearless... For the Jew the world is a cage filled with wild beasts. The door is locked and he is there without whip or revolve r. His courage is so great that he does not even smell the dung in the corne r. The spectators applaud but he does not hear. The drama, he thinks, is going on inside the cage. The cage, he thinks, is the world. Standing there alone and helpless, the door locked, he finds that the lions do not understand his languag e. Not one lion has ever heard of Spinoza. Spinoza? Why they can't even get their teeth into him. \"Give us meat!\" they roar, while he stands there petrifi ed, his ideas frozen, his Weltanschauung a trapez e out of rea ch. A single blow of the lion's paw and his cosm ogon y is smashed. The lions, too, are disappo inted. They expec ted blood, bones, gristle, sinews. They chew and chew , but the words are chide and chicle is indigest ible. Chicle is a base over which you sprinkle sugar , pepsin, thyme, licorice. Chicle, when it is gathered by chicl eros, is O.K. The chi cler os came over on the ridge of a sunken continent. They brought with them an algebra ic langu age. In the Arizona desert they met the Mongols of the North, glazed like eggpl ants. Time shortl y after the earth had taken its gyroscopic lean – when the Gulf Strea m was parting ways with the Japanese curren t. In the heart of the soil they found tufa rock. They embroid ered the very bowels of the earth with their language. They ate one anoth er's entrails and the forest closed in on them, on their bones and skulls, on their lace tufa. Their langu age was lost. Here and there one still finds the re mnants of a m enageri e, a brain plate covered with figures. What has all this to do with you, Moldorf? The word in your mouth is anarch y. Say it, Moldorf, I am waiting for it. Nobod y know s, when we shake hands, the rivers that pour through our sweat. Whilst you are framing your words, your lips half parted, the saliva gurgling in your cheeks, I have jumped halfwa y across Asia. Were I to take your cane, mediocr e as it is, and poke a little hole in your side, I could collect enough material to fill the British Museum . We stand on five minutes and devour centuries.

They have the appearance of Tyrolean tablecloths dipped in lysol. The room sparkl es. I sit on the bed in a daze, thinking about man before his birth. Suddenl y bells begin to toll, a weird, unear thly music, as if I had been transl ated to the steppes of Centra l Asia. Some ring out with a long, lingering roll, some erupt drunkenl y, maudlin ly. And now it is quiet again, excep t for a last note that barel y grazes the silenc e of the night – just a faint, high gong snuffed out lik e a fla me. I have made a silent compact with myself not to chang e a line of what I write. I am not interest ed in perfe cting my thoughts, nor my actions. Beside the perfect ion of Turgenev I put the perfec tion of Dostoevski. (Is there anything more perfect than The Eternal Husband ?) Here, then, in one and the same medium, we have two kinds of perfect ion. But in Van Gogh' s letters there is a perfection beyond either of these. It is the triumph of the ind ividual over art. There is only one thing which interests me vitally now, and that is the recording of all that which is omitted in books. Nobod y, so far as I can see, is making use of those elements in the air which gives direction and motivation to our lives. Only the killers seem to be extrac ting from life some satisfac tory measure of what they are putting into it. The age demands violenc e, but we are getting only abortive explosions. Revolut ions are nipped in the bud, or else succeed too quick ly. Passion is quickl y exhausted. Men fall back on ideas, com me d'habitud e.

Someon e is co ming to rent the apart ment.... It looks as though it were finished, my life at the Villa Borghese. Well, I'll take up these pages and move on. Things will happen elsewhere. Things are always happening. It seems wherever I go there is dram a. People are like lice – they get under your skin and bury themselves there. You scratch and scratch until the blood comes, but you can't get permanently deloused. Everywhere I go .peopl e are making a mess of their lives. Everyone has his private traged y. It's in the blood now – misfortun e, ennui, grief, suicide. The atmospher e is saturat ed with disaste r, frustration, futility. Scrat ch and scratch – until there's no skin left. Howeve r, the effect upon me is exhilarating. Instead of being discourag ed, or depressed, I enjoy it. I am crying for more and more disasters, for bigger calamities, for grander failures. I want the whole world to be out of whack, I want ever yone to scratch himself to death. So fast and furiousl y am I compelled to live now that there is scarcel y time to record even these fragm entary notes. After the telephon e call, a gentl eman and his wife arriv ed. I went upstairs to lie down during the transac tion. Lay there wondering what my next move would be. Surely not to go back to the fairy's bed and toss about all night flicking bread crumbs with my toes. That puking little bastard! If there's anything worse than being a fairy it's being a miser. A timid, quaking little bugger who lived in constant fear of going broke some day – the 18th of March perhaps, or the 25th of May precise ly. Coffee without milk or sugar. Bread without butter. Meat without gravy, or no meat at"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"all. Without this and withou t that! That dirty little miser! Open the bureau drawer one day and find money hidden away in a sock. Over two thousand francs – and checks that he hadn't even cashed. Even that I wouldn't have minded so much if there weren't always coffee ground s in my beret and garbage on the floor, to say nothing of the cold cream jars and the greas y towels and the sink always stopped up. I tell you, the little bastard he smelled bad – except when he doused himself with cologne. His ears were dirty, his eyes were dirty, his ass was dirty. He was double - jointed, asthm atic, lousy, picayune, morbid. I could have forgiven him everything if only he had handed me a decent breakf ast! But a man who has two thousand francs hidden away in a dirty sock and refuses to wear a clean shirt or smear a little butter over his bread, such a man is not just a fa iry, nor even just a m iser – he's an im becile! But that's neither here nor there, about the fairy. I'm keeping an ear open as to what' s going on down stairs. It's a Mr. Wren and his wife who have called to look at the apartment. They're talking about taking it. Only talk ing about it, thank God. Mrs. Wren has a loose laugh – complications ahead. Now Mister Wren is talking. His voice is raucous, scraping, booming, a heavy blunt weapon that wedge s its way through flesh and bone and carti lage. Boris calls me down to be introduced. He is rubbing his hands, like a pawnbroker . They are talking about a stor y Mr. Wren wrote, a stor y about a spavin ed horse. \"But I thought Mr. Wren was a pain ter?\" \"To be sure,\" says Boris, with a twinkle in his eye, \"but in the wintert ime he writes. And he writes well ... rem arkabl y well.\" I try to indu ce Mr . Wren to talk, to sa y something, an ything, to t alk about the spavin ed horse, if necessar y. But Mr. Wren is almost inarticulate. When he essays to speak of those drear y months with the pen he becomes uninte lligible. Months and months he spends before setting a word to paper . (And there are only three months of winter!) What does he cogitate all those months and months of winter ? So help me God, I can't see this guy as a writer. Yet Mrs. Wren says that when he sits down to it the stuff just pou rs out. The talk drifts. It is difficult to follow Mr. Wren's mind because he says nothing. He thinks as he goes along – so Mrs. Wren puts it. Mrs. Wren puts everything about Mr. Wren in the loveliest light. \"He thinks as he goes along\" – very charming, charming indeed, as Borowski would say, but really very painful, particularly when the thinker is nothing but a spavined horse. Boris hands me money to buy liquo r. Going for the liquor I am alread y intox icated. I know just how I'll begin when I get back to the house. Walking down the street it commences, the grand speech inside me that's gurgling like Mrs. Wren's loose laugh. Seem s to me she had a slight edge on already. Listens beaut ifully when she's tight. Coming out of the wine shop I hear the urinal gurgling. Everything is loose and splash y. I want Mr s. Wren to list en... Boris is rubbing his hands again. Mr. Wren is still stuttering and splutter ing. I have a bottle between my legs and I'm shoving the corkscrew in. Mrs. Wren has her mouth parted expectan tly. The wine is splashing between my legs, the sun is splashing through the bay windo w, and inside my veins there is a bubble and splash of a thousand crazy things that commence to gush out of me now pell - mell.

With that bottle between my legs and the sun splashing through the windo w I exper ience once again the splendor of those miserable days when I first arrived in Paris, a bewildered, povert y - stricken individua l who haunted the streets like a ghost at a banquet. Everything comes back to me in a rush – the toilets that wouldn't work, the prince who shined my shoes, the Cinema Splend ide where I slept on the patron's overco at, the bars in the window , the feeling of suffocation, the fat cockroach es, the drinking and carousing that went on between times, Rose Cannaqu e and Naples dying in the sunligh t. Dancing the streets on an empty belly and now and then calling on strange peopl e – Mada me Delor me, for instance. How I ever got to Madam e Delorme's, I can't imagine any more. But I got there, got inside somehow , past the butler, past the maid with her little white apron, got right inside the palac e with my corduro y trouser s and my hunting jacket – and not a button on my fly. Even now I can taste again the golden ambiance of that room where Mada me Delor me sat upon a throne in her mannish rig, the goldfish in the bowls, the maps of the ancient world, the beautifu lly bound books; I can feel again her heavy hand resting upon my shoulder , frighten ing me a little with her heavy Lesbi an air. More comfortab le down below in that thick stew pouring into the Gare St. Lazare, the whores in the doorwa ys, seltzer bottles on every table; a thick tide of semen flood ing the gutters. Nothing better between five and seven than to be pushed around in that throng, to follow a leg or a beaut iful bust, to move along with the tide and everything whirling in your brain. A weird sort of content ment in those days. No appoint ments, no invitations for dinner , no progra m, no dough. The golden period, when I had not a single friend. Each morning the drear y walk to the Americ an Express, and each morning the inevitable answer from the clerk. Dashing here and there like a bedbug, gathering butts now and then, sometimes furtive ly, sometimes brazenly; sitting down on a bench and squeez ing my guts to stop the gnawing, or walking through the Jardin des Tuileries and getting an erection looking at the dumb statues. Or wandering along the Seine at night, wandering and wandering, and going m ad with the beau ty of it, the trees leaning to, the broken images in the water , the rush of the current under the blood y lights of the bridges, the women sleeping in doorways, sleeping on newspapers, sleeping in the rain; everywhere the musty porches of the cathedra ls and beggars and lice and old hags full of St. Vitus' dance ; pushcarts stacked up like wine barrels in the side streets, the smell of berries in the market place and the old church surrounded with vegetab les and blue arc lights, the gutters slipper y with garbage and women in satin pumps staggering through the filth and vermin at the end of an all - night souse. The Place St. Sulpice, so quiet and deserted, where toward midnigh t there came every night the woman with the busted u mbre lla and the crazy veil; every night she slept there on a bench under her torn umbre lla, the ribs hanging down, her dress turning green, her bony fingers and the odor of decay oozing from her body; and in the morning I'd be sitting there myself, taking a quiet snooze in the sunshine, cursing the goddam ned pigeons gathering up the crumbs everywhere. St. Sulpi ce! The fat belfries, the garish posters over the door, the candles flaming inside. The Square so beloved of Anatole France, with that drone and buzz from the altar, the splash of the fountain, the pigeons cooing, the crum bs disappear ing like magic and only a dull rumbling in the hollow of the guts. Here I would sit day after day thinking of Germaine and that dirty little street near the Bastille where she lived, and that buzz - buzz going on behind the altar, the buses whizz ing by, the sun beating down into the asphalt and the asphalt working into me and Germ aine, into the asphal t and all Paris in the big fat belfries."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"And it was down the Rue Bonapar te that only a year before Mona and I used to walk every night, after we had taken leave of Borow ski.

The music is still playing and maybe Mona'll be coming to fetch me, or Borow ski with his gold - knobbed cane, but I'm in her arms now and she has hold of me and I don't care who comes or what happens. We wriggle into the cabine t and ther e I stand her up, slap up against the wall, and I tr y to get it into her but it won't work and so we sit down on the seat and try it that way but it won't work either. No matter how we try it it won't work. And all the while she's got hold of my prick, she's clutching it like a lifesaver , but it's no use, we're too hot, too eager . The music is still playing and so we waltz out of the cabine t into the vestibul e again and as we're dancing there in the shithouse I come all over her beautifu l gown and she's sore as hell about it. I stumb le back to the table and there's Borow ski with his ruddy face and Mona with her disapproving eye. And Borowski says \"Let's all go to Brussels tomorrow ,\" and we agree, and when we get back to the hotel I vomit all over the place, in the bed, in the washbo wl, over the suits and gowns and the galoshes and canes and th e notebooks I never touched and the m anuscripts cold and dead. A few months later. The same hotel, the same room. We look out on the court yard where the bicycles are parked, and there is the little room up above, under the attic, where some smart young Alec played the phonograph all day long and repea ted clever little things at the top of his voice. I say \"we\" but I'm getting ahead of myself, because Mona has been away a long time and it's just today that I'm meeting her at the Gare St. Lazar e. Toward evening I'm standing there with my face squeez ed between the bars, but there's no Mona, and I read the cable over again but it doesn't help any. I go back to the Quarter and just the same I put away a heart y meal. Strolling past the Dame a little later sudden ly I see a pale, heavy face and burning eyes – and the little velve t suit that I always adore because under the soft velve t there were always her warm breasts, the marble legs, cool, firm, muscular. She rises up out of a sea of faces and embraces me, embraces me passionat ely – a thousand eyes, noses, fingers, legs, bottles, window s, purses, saucers all glaring at us and we in each other's arms oblivious. I sit down beside her and she talks – a flood of talk. Wild consu mptive notes of hysteria, perversion,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"lepros y. I hear not a word because she is beaut iful and I love her and now I am happy and will ing to die. We walk down the Rue du Chât eau, look ing for Eugene. Walk over the railroad bridge where I used to watch the trains pulling out and feel all sick inside wondering where the hell she could be. Everything soft and enchan ting as we walk over the bridge. Smok e coming up between our legs, the tracks creaking, semaphores in our blood. I feel her body close to mine – all mine now – and I stop to rub my hands over the warm velve t. Everything around us is crumbling, crum bling and the warm body under the warm velvet is aching for me ... Back in the very same room and fifty francs to the good, thanks to Eugene. I look out on the court but the phonograph is silent. The trunk is open and her things are lying around everywhere just as before. She lies down on the bed with her clothes on. Once, twice, three times, four times ... I'm afraid she'll go mad ... in bed, under the blank ets, how good to feel her bod y again! But for how long? Willft last this time? Alread y I have a presenti ment that it won't. She talks to me so feverishl y – as if there will be no tomorrow . \"Be quiet, Mona! Just look at me ... don 't talk .\" Final ly she drops off and I pull my arm from under her. My eyes dose. Her body is there beside me ... it will be there till morning surel y... It was in Februar y I pulled out of the harbor in a blind ing snowstorm . The last glimpse I had of her was in the windo w waving good - bye to me. A man standing on the other side of the street, at the corner , his hat pulled down over his eyes, his jowls resting on his lapels. A fetus watching me. A fetus with a cigar in its mouth. Mona at the window waving good- bye. White heavy face, hair streaming wild. And now it is a heavy bedroo m, breath ing regularl y through the gills, sap still oozing from betwe en her legs, a warm feline odor and her hair in my mouth. My eyes are closed. We breathe warm ly into each other's mouth. Close togethe r, America three thousand miles away. I never want to see it again. To have her here in bed with me, breathing on me, her hair in my mouth – I count that something of a m iracle. Nothing can happen now til l morning... I wake from a deep slumb er to look at her. A pale light is trickling in. I look at her beautifu l wild hair. I feel something crawl ing down my neck. I look at her again, closel y. Her hair is alive. I pull back the sheet – more of them. They are swarm ing over the pi llow. It is a little after daybreak. We pack hurriedl y and sneak out of the hotel. The cafés are still closed. We walk, and as we walk we scratch ourselves. The day opens in milky whiteness, streaks of salmon – pink sky, snails leaving their shells. Paris. Paris. Everything happens here. Old, crum bling walls and the pleasan t sound of water running in the urinals. Men licking their mustaches at the bar. Shutters going up with a bang and little streams purling in the gutters. Amer Picon in huge scarlet letters. Zigzag. Which way will we go and why or where or what? Mona is hungr y, her dress is thin. Nothing but evening wraps, bottles of perfu me, barbaric earrings, bracelets, depila tories. We sit down in a billiard parlor on the Avenue du Maine and order hot coffee. The toilet is out of order . We shall have to sit some time before we can go to another hotel. Meanwhile we pick bedbugs out of each other's hair. Nervou s. Mona is losing her temper. Must have a bath. Must have this.

Only ten o'clock and we have alread y had breakfast and been out for a walk. We have an Elsa here with us now. \"Step softly for a few da ys,\" cau tions Boris. The day begins gloriousl y: a bright sky, a fresh wind, the houses newly washed. On our way to the Post Office Boris and I discussed the book. The Last Book – which is going to be written anon ymously. A new day is beginning. I felt it this morning as we stood before one of Dufresne' s glisten ing canvases, a sort of déj euner intime in the thirte enth centur y, sans vin. A fine, fleshy nude, solid, vibran t, pink as a fingernai l, with glistening billows of flesh; all the secondar y charac teristi cs, and a few of the primary. A body that sings, that has the moisture of dawn. A still life, only nothing is still, nothing dead here. The table creaks with food; it is so heavy it is sliding out of the frame. A thirteenth century repast – with all the jungles notes that he has memorized so well. A family of gazell es and zebras nipping th e fronds of the pal ms. And now we have Elsa. Site was playing for us this morning while we were in bed. Step softly for a few days... Good! Elsa is the maid and I am the guest. And Boris is the big cheese. A new drama is beginning. I'm laughing to myself as I write this. He knows what is going to happen, tha t lynx, Boris. He has a nose for th ings too. Step softly.... Boris is on pins and needl es. At any moment now his wife may appear on the scene. She weighs well over 180 pound s, that wife of his. And Boris is only a handful. There you have the situation. He tries to explain it to me on our way home at night. It is so tragic and so ridicu lous at the same time that I am oblig ed to stop now and then and laugh in his face. \"Why do you laugh so?\" he says gentl y, and then he commences himself, with that whim pering, hysterical note in his voice, like a helpless wretch who realizes suddenl y that no matter how many frock coats he puts on he will never make a man. He wants to run away, to take a new name. \"She can have everything, that cow, if only she leaves me alone,\" he whines. But first the apartment has to be rented, and the deeds signed, and a thousand other details for which his frock coat will come in handy. But the size of her! – that's what really worries him. If we were to find her suddenl y standing on the doorstep when we arrive he would faint – that's how much he respects her! And so we've got to go easy with Elsa for a while. Elsa is only there to make breakfast – and to sho w the apart ment. But Elsa is alread y underm ining me. That German blood. Those melanchol y songs. Coming down the stairs this moming, with the fresh coffee in my nostri ls, I was humming softly... \" Es wä r' so schön gewesen .\" For breakfast, that. And in a little while the English boy upstairs with his Bach. As Elsa says – \"he needs a woman.\" And Elsa needs something too. I can feel it. I didn't say anything to Boris about it, but while he was clean ing his te eth this morning Elsa was giving me an earful abou t Berlin, about the women who look so attra ctive from behind, and when the y turn round – wow , syphil is! It seems to me that Elsa looks at me rather wistfully. Something left over from the breakfast table. This afternoon we were writing, back to back, in the studio. She had begun a letter to her lover who is in Italy. The machine got jammed. Boris had gone to look at a cheap room he will take as soon as the apartment is rented. There was nothing for it but to make love to Elsa. She wanted it. And yet I felt a little sorry for her. She had"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"only written the first line to her lover – I read it out of the corner of my eye as I bent over her. But it couldn't be helped. That damned German music, so melancholy, so sentimental. It under mined me. And then her beady little eyes, so hot and sorrowful at the sa me time. After it was over I asked her to play something for me. She's a musician, Elsa, even though it sounded like broken pots and skulls clank ing. She was weeping, too, as she played. I don't blame her. Everywhere the same thing, she says. Everywhere a man, and then she has to leave, and then there's an abort ion and then a new job and then another man and nobod y gives a fuck about her excep t to use her. All this after she's played Schum ann for me – Schum ann, that slobber y, sentimental Germ an bastard! Somehow I feel sorry as hell for her and yet I don't give a damn. A cunt who can play as she does ought to have better sense than be tripped up by every guy with a big putz who happens to come along. But that Schum ann gets into my blood. She's still sniffling, Elsa; but my mind is far away. I'm think ing of Tania and how she claws away at her adagio. I'm thinking of lots of things that are gone and buried. Thinking of a summer afternoon in Greenpo int when the Germ ans were romping over Belgiu m and we had not yet lost enough money to be concern ed over the rape of a neutral countr y. A time when we were still innocent enough to listen to poets and to sit around a table in the twilight rapping for departed spirits. All that afternoon and evening the atmosphere is satura ted with Germ an music; the whole neighborhood is Germ an, more Germ an even than Germany. We were brought up on Schum ann and Hugo Wolf and sauerkraut and kümmel and potato dumplings. Toward evening we're sitting around a big table with the curtains drawn and some fool two - headed wench is rapping for Jesus Christ. We're holding hands under the table and the dame next to me has two fingers in my fly. And finally we lie on the floor, behind the piano, while someone sings a drear y song. The air is stifling and her breath is boozy. The pedal is moving up and down, stiffly, automatically, a crazy, futile movement, like a tower of dung that takes twent y - seven years to build but keeps perfe ct time. I pull her over me with the sounding board in my ears; the room is dark and the carpet is sticky with the kümmel that has been spilled about. Suddenl y it seems as if the dawn were coming: it is like water purling over ice and the ice is blue with a rising mist, glaciers sunk in emerald green, chamois and antelope, golden groupers, sea cow s mooching along and the amber jack leaping over the Arctic rim... Elsa is sitting in my lap. Her eyes are like little belly-buttons. I look at her large mouth, so wet and glistening, and I cover it. She is humming now... \" Es wä r' so schön gewesen ...\" Ah, Elsa, you don't know yet what that means to me, your Trompet er von Säckingen. Germ an Singing Societies, Schwaben Hall, the Turnverein ... links um, rechts um ... and then a whack over the ass with the end of a rope. Ah, the Germ ans! They take you all over like an omnibus. They give you indigest ion. In the same night one cannot visit the morgue, the infirmary, the zoo, the signs of the zodiac, the limbos of philosoph y, the caves of episte mology, the arcana of Freud and Stekel... On the merry - go - round one doesn't get anywhere, whereas with the Germ ans one can go from Vega to Lope de Vega, all in one night, and come away as foolish as Parsifal. As I say, the day began gloriousl y. It was only this morning that I became conscious again of this physical Paris of which I have been unaware for weeks. Perhaps it is because the book has begun to grow inside me. I am carrying it around with me everywhere. I walk through the streets big with child and the cops escort me acros s the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"street. Women get up to offer me their seats. Nobod y pushes me rudel y any more. I am pregnant. I waddle awkwardl y, my big sto mach pressed against the weight of the world. It was this morning, on our way to the Post Office, that we gave the book its final imprimatur. We have evolv ed a new cosmogon y of literature, Boris and I. It is to be a new Bible – The Last Book. All those who have anything to say will say it here – anonymously. We will exhaust the age. After us not another book – not for a generation, at least. Heretofore we had been digging in the dark, with nothing but instinc t to guide us. Now we shall have a vessel in which to pour the vital fluid, a bomb which, when we throw it, will set off the world. We shall put into it enough to give the writers of tomorrow their plots, their dramas, their poems, their myths, their scienc es. The world will be able to feed on it for a thousand years to come. It is colossal in its pretent iousness. The thought of it al most shatters me. For a hundred years or more the world, our world, has been dying. And not one man, in these last hundred years or so, has been crazy enough to put a bomb up the asshole of creation and set it off. The world is rotting away, dying piece meal. But it needs the coup de grâce, it needs to be blown to smithereens. Not one of us is intac t, and y et we have in us all the continents and the seas betwe en the continen ts and the birds of the air. We are going to put it down – the evolution of this world which has died but which has not been buried. We are swim ming on the face of time and all else has drowned, is drowning, or will drown. It will be enorm ous, the Book. There will be oceans of space in which to move about, to perambulate, to sing, to dance, to climb, to bathe, to leap somersau lts, to whine, to rape, to murder. A cathedr al, a veritab le cathedra l, in the building of which everybody will assist who has lost his identity. There will be masses for the dead, prayers, confessions, hymns, a moaning and a chattering, a sort of murderous insoucianc e; there will be rose windo ws and gargoyles and acolytes and pallbearers. You can bring your horses in and gallop through the aisles. You can butt your head against the walls – they won't give. You can pray in any language you choose, or you can curl up outside and go to sleep. It will last a thousand years, at least, this cathedra l, and there will be no replica, for the builders will be dead and the formu la too. We will have postcards m ade and organize tours. We will build a town around it and set up a free commune. We have no need for genius – genius is dead. We have need for strong hands, for spirits who are will ing to give up the ghost and put on flesh... The day is moving along at a fine tempo. I am up on the balcony at Tania's place. The dram a is going on down below in the drawing room. The dram atist is sick and from above his scalp looks more scabrous than ever. His hair is made of straw . His ideas are straw . His wife too is straw , though still a little damp. The whole house is ma de of straw . Here I am up on the balcon y, waiting for Boris to arrive. My last probl em – breakfast – is gone. I have simplified everything. If there are any new proble ms I can carry them in my rucksack, along with my dirty wash. I am throwing away all my sous. What need have I for money? I am a writing machine. The last screw has been added. The thing flows. Be tween m e and the machine there is no estrange ment. I am the machine... . They have not told me yet what the new drama is about, but I can sense it. They are trying to get rid of me. Yet here I am for my dinner , even a little earlier than they expect ed. I have informed them where to sit, what to do. I ask them polite ly if I shall be disturbing them, but what I really mean, and they know it well, is – wil l you be disturbing me? No, you blissful cockroach es, you are not disturbing me. You are"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"nou rishing me. I see you sitting there close togeth er and I know there is a chasm between you. Your nearness is the nearn ess of planets. I am the void between you. If I withdraw there will be no void for y ou to swim in. Tania is in a hostile mood – I can feel it. She resents m y being fi lled with an ything but herself. She knows by the very caliber of my excitement that her value is reduced to zero. She knows that I did not come this evening to fertilize her. She knows there is something germinating inside me which will destro y her. She is slow to realiz e, but she is reali zing it... Sylvester looks more content. He will embrace her this evening at the dinner table. Even now he is reading my manuscript, preparing to inflame my ego, to set my ego against hers. It will be a strange gathering this evening. The stage is being set. I hear the tinkle of the glasses. The wine is being brought out. There will be bump ers do wned and S ylvester who is i ll wil l come out of his il lness. It was only last night, at Cronstadt's, that we projected this setting. It was ordain ed that the wom en must suffer, that offstage there should be more terror and violen ce, more disasters, mo re suffering, more woe and m isery. It is no accident that propels people like us to Paris. Paris is simply an artificial stage, a revolving stage th at per mits the spectator to gli mpse al l phases of the conflic t. Of itself Paris initiates no dram as. They are begun elsewhere. Paris is simply an obstetrical instrum ent that tears the living embryo from the womb and puts it in the incub ator. Paris is the cradle of artificial births. Rocking here in the cradle each one slips back into his soil: one dreams back to Berlin, New York, Chicago, Vienna, Minsk. Vienna is never more Vienna than in Paris. Everything is raised to apotheosis. The cradle gives up its babes and new ones take their places. You can read here on the walls where Zola lived and Balzac and Dante and Strindber g and everybody who ever was anything. Everyone has lived here som e time or other . Nobod y dies here... They are talking down stairs. Their language is symbolic. The world \"struggle\" enters into it. Sylvester , the sick dramatist, is saying: \"I am just reading the Manifesto .\" And Tania says - \" Whose? \" Yes, Tania, I heard you. I am up here writing about you and you divine it well. Speak more , that I may record you. For when we go to table I shall not be able to make any notes... Suddenl y Tania remarks: \"There is no prom inent hall in this place.\" Now what does tha t mean, if an ything? They are putting up pictures now. That, too, is to impress me. See, they wish to say, we are at home here, living the conjugal life. Making the home attractive. We will even argue a little about the pictur es, for your benefit. And Tania remarks again : \"How the eye deceives one!\" Ah, Tania, what things you say! Go on, carry out this farce a little longer . I am here to get the dinner you prom ised me; I enjoy this comedy tremendousl y. And now Sylvester takes the lead. He is trying to explain one of Borowski' s gouaches. \"Com e here, do you see? One of them is playing the guitar; the other is holding a girl in his lap.\" True, Sylvester . Very true. Borowski and his guitars! The girls in his lap! Only one never quite knows w hat it is he holds in his lap, or whether i t is real ly a man playing the gui tar... Soon Moldorf will be trotting in on all fours and Boris with that helpless little laugh of his. There will be a golden pheasant for dinner and Anjou and short fat cigars.

Had to knock off for an hour or so. Another custom er to look at the apartment. Upstairs the blood y English man is practising his Bach. It is imper ative now, when someone comes to look at the apartment, to run upstairs and ask the pianist to lay off for a while. Elsa is telephoning the greengro cer. The plumber is putting a new seat on the toilet bowl. Whenever the doorbel l rings Boris loses his equilibrium. In the excitement he has dropped his glasses; he is on his hands and knees, his frock coat is dragging the floor. It is a little like the Grand Guignol – the starving poet come to give the butch er's daughter lesson s. Every time the phone rings the poet's mouth waters. Mallarmé sounds like a sirloin steak, Victor Hugo like foie de veau. Elsa is ordering a delicate little lunch for Boris – \"a nice juicy little pork chop,\" she says. I see a whole flock of pink hams lying cold on the marble, wonderful hams cushioned in white fat. I have a terrific hunger though we've only had breakfast a few minutes ago – it's the lunch that I'll have to skip. It's only Wednesda ys that I eat lunch, thanks to Borowski. Elsa is still telephoning – she forgot to order a piece of bacon. \"Yes, a nice little piece of bacon, not too fatty,\" she says ... Zut alors ! Throw in some sweetbr eads, throw in some mountain oysters and some psst clams! Throw in some fried liverwurst while you're at it; I could gobble up the fif teen hundred pla ys of Lope de Vega in one sitt ing. It is a beautiful woman who has come to look at the apartment. An Amer ican, of course. I stand at the window with my back to her watch ing a sparrow peck ing at a fresh turd. Amazing how easily the sparrow is provided for. It is raining a bit and the drops are very big. I used to think a bird couldn't fly if its wings got wet. Amazing how these rich dames come to Paris and find all the swell studios. A little talent and a big purse. If it rains they have a chance to displa y their brand new slickers. Food is nothing : sometimes they're so busy gadding about that they haven't time for lunch. Just a little sandwich, a wafer , at the Café de la Paix or the Ritz Bar. \"For the daught ers of gentlefo lk only\" – that's what it says at the old studio of Puvis de Chavannes. Happened to pass there the other day. Rich Amer ican cunts with paint boxes slung over their should ers. A little talent and a fat purse. The sparrow is hopping frantically from one cobbl estone to anothe r. Truly hercu lean efforts, if you stop to exam ine closel y. Everywhere there is food lying about – in the gutter , I mean. The beaut iful American woman is inquir ing about the toilet. The toilet! Let me show you, you velvet - snooted gazelle! The toilet, you say? Par ici, Mada me. N'oubl iez pas que les plac es nu mér otées sont réservées aux mutilés de la guer re. Boris is rubbing his hands – he is putting the finishing touches to the deal. The dogs are barking in the court yard; they bark like wolves. Upstairs Mrs. Melvern ess is moving the furniture around. She had nothing to do all day, she's bored; if she finds a crumb of dirt anywhere she cleans the whole house. There's a bunch of green grapes on the table and a bottle of wine – vin de choix, ten degre es. \"Yes,\" says Boris. \"I could make a washstand for you, just come here, please. Yes, this is the toilet. There is one upstairs too, of course. Yes, a thousand francs a m onth. You don't car e much for Utrillo, you say? No, this is it. It needs a new washer , that's all....

If this rich bastard takes the place I won't even have a place to sleep. It's hard to know, when you're in such a jam, which is worse – not having a place to sleep or not having a place to work. One can sleep almost anywhere, but one must have a place to work. Even if it's not a masterp iece you're doing. Even a bad novel requir es a chair to sit on and a bit of privacy. These rich cunts never think of a thing like that. Whenever they want to lower their soft behinds there's alwa ys a cha ir standing ready for the m... Last night we left Sylvester and his God sitting togeth er before the hearth. Sylvester in his pajam as, Moldorf with a cigar between his lips. Sylvester is pee ling an orange. He puts the peel on the couch cover. Moldorf draws closer to him. He asks perm ission to read again that brilliant parod y, The Gates of Heaven. We are getting ready to go, Boris and I. We are too gay for this sickroo m atmosphere. Tania is going with us. She is gay because she is going to escape. Boris is gay because the God in Moldorf is dead. I am gay because it is anoth er act we are going to put on. Moldorf's voice is rever ent. \"Can I stay with you, Sylveste r, until you go to bed?\" He has been staying with him for the last six days, buying medicine, running errands for Tania, comfort ing, consoling, guarding the portals against malevolent intruders like Boris and his scalawags. He is like a savage who has discovered that his idol was mutilated during the night. There he sits, at the idol's feet, with breadfruit and grease and jabberwock y prayers. His voice goes out unctuousl y. His limbs are already paral yzed. To Tania he speaks as if she were a priest ess who had broken her vows. \"You must make yourself worth y. Sylvester is your God.\" And while Sylvester is upstairs suffering (he has a li ttle wheeze in the chest) the priest and the priest ess devour the food. \"Y ou are pollut ing yourself,\" he says, the gravy dripping from his lips. He has the capacity for eating and suffering at the same time. While he fends off the dangerous ones he puts out his fat l ittle paw and strokes Tania's hai r. \"I'm beginn ing to fa ll in love with you. You are like my Fann y.\" In other respec ts it has been a fine day for Moldorf. A letter arrived from Amer ica. Moe is getting A's in everything. Murra y is learning to ride the bicycle. The victrola was repaired. You can see from the expression on his face that there were other things in the letter besides repor t cards and velociped es. You can be sure of it because this afternoon he bought 325 francs worth of jewelr y for his Fann y. In addition he wrote her a twent y- page letter. The garçon brought him page after page, filled his founta in pen, served his coffee and cigars, fanned him a little when he perspired, brushed the crum bs from the table, lit his cigar when it went out, bought stamps for him, danced on him, piroue tted, salaamed ... broke his spine damned near. The tip was fat. Bigger and fatter than a Corona Corona. Moldorf probabl y mentioned it in his diary. It was for Fann y's sake. The bracelet and the earrings, they were worth every son he spent. Better to spend it on Fann y than waste it on little strumpets like Germ aine and Odette. Yes, he told Tania so. He showed her his trunk. It is cra mmed with gifts – for Fann y, and for M oe and Murra y. \"My Fann y is the most intelligent woman in the world.

She sits there so peacefully. I am rewarded for all my struggles and heartaches in just watch ing her. She listens intelligently. When I think of your stinking Montparnasse and then of my evenings in Bay Ridge with Fann y after a big meal, I tell you there is no comparison. A simple thing like food, the children, the soft lamps, and Fann y sitting there, a little tired, but cheerful, contented, heavy with bread ... we ju st sit there for hour s withou t saying a word. That's bliss! \"Today she writes me a letter – not one of those dull stock-report letters. She writes me from the heart, in language that even my little Murra y could understand.

Moe, of course, will get a scholarship. But little Murra y, that little genius, Murray, what are we going to do about him? I wrote Fann y not to worry. Send Murra y to school, I said.

Her fat legs are a little too short to reach the floor. Her eyes have a dull permang anate glow. Breasts like ripe red cabbag e; they bobble a little when she leans forward. But the sad thing about her is that the juice has been cut off. She sits there like a dead storage battery; her face is out of plum b – it needs a little animation, a sudden spurt of juice to bring it back into focus. Moldorf is jumping around in front of her like a fat toad. His flesh quivers. He slips and it is difficult for him to roll over again on his belly. She prods him with her thick toes. His eyes protrude a little furthe r. \"Kick me again, Fann y, that was good.\" She gives him a good prod this time – it leaves a perm anent dent in his paunch. His face is close to the carpet ; the wattles are joggling in the nap of the rug. He livens up a bit, flips around, springs fro m furniture to furniture. \"Fann y, you are marvelous!\" He is sit ting now on her should er. He bites a little piece from her ear, just a little tip from the lobe where it doesn 't hurt. But she's still dead – all storage batter y and no juice. He falls on her lap and lies there quivering like a toothache. He is all warm now and helpless. His belly glistens like a paten t-leather shoe. In the sockets of his eyes a pair of fancy vest buttons. \"Unbut ton my eyes, Fann y, I want to see you better!\" Fann y carries him to bed and drops a little hot wax over his eyes. She puts rings around his navel and a thermometer up his ass. She places him and he quivers again. Suddenl y he's dwindled, shrunk completely out of sight. She searches all over for him, in her intestines, everywhere. Something is tickling her – she doesn't know where exact ly. The bed is full of toads and fancy vest buttons. \"Fann y, where are you?\" Something is tickling her – she can't say where. The buttons are dropping off the bed. The toads are climbing the walls. A tickling and a tickling. \"Fann y, take the wax out of my eyes! I want to look at you!\" But Fann y is laughing, squirming with laughte r.

Oppo site me is the Hôtel de Louisiane. A grim old hostelry known to the bad boys of the Rue de Bud in the good old days. Hotels and food, and I'm walking about like a leper with crabs gnawing at my entrails. On Sunda y mornings there's a fever in the streets. Nothing like it anywhere, except perhaps on the East Side, or down around Chatha m Square. The Rue de l'Echaudé is seething. The streets twist and turn, at every angle a fresh hive of activity. Long queues of people with veget ables under their arms, turning in here and there with crisp, sparkling appeti tes. Nothing but food, food, food. Makes one delir ious. Pass the Square de Furstenber g. Looks differen t now, at high noon. The other night when I passed by it was deserted, bleak, spectr al. In the middle of the square four black trees that have not yet begun to blossom . Intellectual trees, nourished by the paving stones. Like T. S. Eliot's verse. Here, by God, if Marie Lauren cin ever brought her Lesbians out into the open, would be the place for them to commune. Très lesbienn e ici . Steril e, hybrid, dr y as Boris' heart. In the little garden adjoining the Eglise St. Germ ain are a few dismount ed gargoyles. Monsters that jut forward with a terrifying plunge.

At the Galerie Zak across the way some imbecile has made a pictur e of the cosmos – on the flat . A painter's cosmos! Full of odds and ends, bric - a-brac. In the lower left- hand corner , howeve r, there's an anchor – and a dinn er bell. Salute! Salute! O Cosmos! Still prowling around. Mid afternoon. Guts rattling. Beginning to rain now. Notre- Dame rises tomblike from the water . The gargoyles lean far out over the lace façade. They hang there like an idée fixe in the mind of a monomaniac.

How a man can wander about all day on an empty belly, and even get an erection once in a while, is one of those mysteries which are too easily explained by the \"anato mists of the soul.\" On a Sunda y afternoon, when the shutters are down and the proletar iat posses ses the street in a kind of dumb torpor , there are certain thoroughfares which remind one of nothing less than a big chancrous cock laid open longitudin ally. And it is just these highwa ys, the Rue St. Denis, for instan ce, or the Faubour g du Temple – which attrac t one irresistibl y, much as in the old days, around Union Square or the upper reaches of the Bower y, one was drawn to the dime museu ms where in the show window s there were displayed wax reproduc tions of various organs of the body eaten away by syphilis and other venere al diseases. The city sprouts out like a huge organism diseased in every part, the beautifu l thoroughfares only a little less repulsive because th ey have been drained of their pus. At the City Nortier, somewher e near the Place du Comb at, I pause a few minutes to drink in the full squalor of the scene. It is a rectangular court like many another which one glimpses through the low passagewa ys that flank the old arteri es of Paris. In the middle of the court is a clump of decrepit buildings which have so rotted away that they have collapsed on one another and formed a sort of intestin al embrace. The ground is uneven, the flagging slipper y with slime. A sort of human dump heap which has been filled in with cinders and dry garbag e. The sun is setting fast. The colors die. They shift from purple to dried blood, from nacre to bister, from cool dead grays to pigeon shit. Here and there a lopsided monster stands in the window blinking like an owl. There is the shrill squawk of children with pale faces and bony limbs, ricket y little urchins marked with the forceps. A fetid odor seeps from the walls, the odor of a mildewed mattress.

Not forgetting Rodin, the evil genius of The Wandering Jew , who practised his nefarious ways \"until the day when he was enflamed and outwit ted by the octoroon Cecily.\" Sitting in the Square du Temple, musing over the doings of the horse knackers led by Jean Caboche, I have thought long and ruefu lly over the sad fate of Charles the Silly. A half - wit, who prowled about the halls of his Hôtel St. Paul, garbed in the filthiest rags, eaten away by ulcers and vermin, gnawing a bone, when they flung him one, like a mangy dog. At the Rue des Lions I looked for the stones of the old menager ie where he once fed his pets. His only diversion, poor dolt, aside from those card ga mes with his \"low - born co mpanion,\" Odet te de Cham pdivers. It was a Sunda y afternoon, much like this, when I first met Germ aine. I was strolling along the Boulevard Beau marcha is, rich by a hundred francs or so which my wife had frantic ally cabled from America. There was a touch of spring in the sir, a poisonous, malefic spring that seemed to burst from the manholes. Night after night I had been coming back to this quarter , attracted by certain leprous streets which only revealed their sinister splendor when the light of day had oozed away and the whores commenced to take up their posts. The Rue du Pasteur - Wagner is one I recall in particu lar, corner of the Rue Amelot which hides behind the boulevard like a slumb ering lizard. Here, at the neck of the bottle, so to speak, there was always a cluster of vultures who croak ed and flapped their dirty wings, who reach ed out with sharp talons and plucked you into a doorway. Jolly, rapac ious devils who didn't even give you time to button your pants when it was over. Led you into a little room off the street, a room without a windo w usuall y, and, sitting on the edge of the bed with skirts tucked up gave you a quick inspection, spat on your cock, and placed it for you. While you washed yourself another one stood at the door and, holding her victim by the hand, watched nonchalan tly as you gave the finishing touch es to y our toilet. Germ aine was different. There was nothing to tell me so from her appearanc e. Nothing to distinguish her from the other trollops who met each afternoon and evening at the Café de l'Eléphan t. As I say, it was a spring day and the few francs my wife had scraped up to cable me were jingling in my pocket. I had a sort of vague premonition that I would not reach the Basti lle without being taken in tow by one of these buzzards. Sauntering along the boulev ard I had noticed her verging toward me with that curious trot-abou t air of a whore and the run - down heels and cheap jewelry and the pasty look of their kind which the rouge onl y accentu ates. It was not difficult to co me to terms with her. We sat in the back of the little tabac called L'Eléphan t and talked it over quickl y. In a few minutes we were in a five franc room on the Rue Amelot, the curtains drawn and the covers thrown back. She didn't rush things, Germaine. She sat on the bidet soaping herself and talked to me pleasant ly about this and that; she liked the knickerbock ers I was wearing. Très chic! she thought. They were once, but I had worn the seat out of them; fortunate ly the jacket covered my ass. As she stood up to dry herself, still talking to me pleasant ly, suddenl y she dropped the towel and, advanc ing toward me leisure ly, she commenced rubbing her pussy affectionately, stroking it with her two hands, caressing it, patting it, patting it. There was something about her eloquen ce at that moment and the way she thrust that rosebush under my nose which remains unfor gettab le; she spoke of it as if it were some extraneous object which she had"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"acquired at great cost, an object whose value had increased with time and which now she prized above everything in the world. Her word s imbued it with a pecul iar fragrance ; it was no longer just her priva te organ, but a treasure, a magic, potent treasure, a God - given thing – and none the less so because she traded it day in and day out for a few pieces of silver. As she flung herself on the bed, with legs spread wide apart, she cupped it with her hands and stroked it some more, murmuring all the while in that hoarse, cracked voice of hers that it was good, beautifu l, a treasure, a little treasure. And it wa s good, that little pussy of hers! That Sunda y afternoon, with its poisonou s breath of spring in the air, everything clicked again. As we stepped out of the hotel I looked her over again in the harsh light of day and I saw clearly what a whore she was – the gold teeth, the geraniu m in her hat, the run-down heels, etc., etc. Even the fact that she had wormed a dinner out of me and cigaret tes and taxi hadn't the least disturbing effect upon me. I encour aged it, in fact. I liked her so well that after dinner we went back to the hotel again and took another shot at it. \"For love,\" this time. And again that big, bushy thing of hers worked its bloom and magic. It began to have an independen t existence – for me too. There was Germ aine and there was that rose - bush of hers. I liked them separa tely and I lik ed the m togeth er. As I say, she was differen t, Germ aine. Later, when she discovered my true circumstances, she treated me nobly – blew me to drinks, gave me credit, pawned my things, introdu ced me to her friends, and so on. She even apolog ized for not lending me money, which I understood quite well after her maquer eau had been pointed out to me. Night after night I walked down the Boulevard Beau marcha is to the little tabac where they all congreg ated and I waited for her to stroll in and give me a few minutes of her precious ti me. When some time later I came to write about Claude, it was not Claud e that I was thinking of but Germ aine... \"All the men she's been with and now you, just you, and barges going by, masts and hulls, the whole damned curren t of life flowing through you, through her , through all the gu ys behind you and after you, the flowers and th e birds and the sun strea ming in and the fragran ce of it choking you, annih ilating you.\" That was for Germ aine! Claud e was not the same, though I admired her tremendousl y – I even thought for a while that I loved her. Claude had a soul and a consci ence; she had refine ment, too, which is bad – in a whore. Claude alwa ys impar ted a feeling of sadnes s; she left the impression, unwittingly, of course, that you were just one more added to the stream which fate had ordained to destro y her. Unwitt ingl y, I say, because Claude was the last person in the world who would consciousl y create such an image in one's mind. She was too delicate, too sensitive for that. At botto m, Claud e was just a good French girl of average breed and intelligence whom life had trick ed somehow; something in her there was which was not tough enough to withstand the shock of daily experien ce. For her were meant those terribl e word s of Louis - Philippe, \"and a night comes when all is over, when so many jaws have closed upon us that we no longer have the strength to stand, and our meat hangs upon our bodies, as though it had been masticated by every mouth.\" Germ aine, on the other hand, was a whore from the cradle; she was thoroughl y satisfied with her role, enjoyed it in fact, except when her stomach pinched or her shoes gave out, little surface things of no account, nothing that ate into her soul, nothing that created torment. Ennui! That was the worst she ever felt. Days there were, no doubt, when she had a bellyful, as we say – but no more than that! Most of the time she enjoyed it – or gave the illusion of enjoying it. It made a differenc e, of course, whom she went with – or came with. But the princip al thing was a man. A man! That was what"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"she craved. A man with something between his legs that could tickle her, that could make her writhe in ecstas y, make her grab that bushy twat of hers with both hands and rub it joyfully, boastful ly, proudl y, with a sense of connec tion, a sense of life. That was the only place where she experien ced any life – down there where she clutched herself with both hands. Germ aine was a whore all the way through, even down to her good heart, her whore' s heart which is not rea lly a good heart but a laz y one, an ind ifferent, flacc id heart that can be touched for a moment, a heart withou t referen ce to any fixed point within, a big flaccid whore's heart that can detach itself for a moment from its true center. However vile and circumscribed was that world which she had created for herself, never theless she functioned in it superbl y. And that in itself is a tonic thing. When, after we had become well acquainted, her companions would twit me, saying that I was in love with Germ aine (a situation almost incon ceivab le to them), I would say: \"Sure! Sure, I'm in love with her! And what's more, I'm going to be faithful to her!\" A lie, of course, because I could no more think of loving Germ aine than I could think of loving a spider; and if I wa s faithfu l, it was not to Germaine but to that bushy thing she carried between her legs. Whenev er I looked at anoth er woman I thought immediately of Germ aine, of that flaming bush which she had left in my mind and which seem ed imperishab le. It gave me pleasure to sit on the terrasse of the little tabac and observe her as she plied her trade, observe her as she resorted to the same grimaces, the same tricks, with others as she had with me. \"She's doing her job!\" – that's how I felt about it, and it was with approbation that I regard ed her transa ctions. Later, when I had taken up with Claude, and I saw her night after night sitting in her accusto med place, her round little butto cks chubbil y ensconced in the plush settee, I felt a sort of inexpressibl e rebell ion toward her; a whore, it seemed to me, had no right to be sit ting there like a lady, waiting timidly for someone to approach and all the while abste miousl y sipping her chocolat. Germaine was a hustler. She didn't wait for you to come to her – she went out and grabbed you. I remember so well the holes in her stockings, and the torn ragged shoes; I remember too how she stood at the bar and with blind, courageous defiance threw a strong drink down her stomach and marched out again. A hustler! Perhaps it wasn 't so pleasant to smell that boozy breath of hers, that breath compounded of weak coffee, cognac, apérit ifs, Pernod s and all the other stuff she guzzl ed between times, what to warm herself and what to summon up strength and courage, but the fire of it penetrated her, it glowed down there betwe en her legs where women ought to glow, and there was establ ished that circuit which makes one feel the earth under his legs aga in. When she lay there with her legs apar t and m oaning, even if she did m oan that way for an y and ever ybody, it was good, it was a proper show of feeling. She didn't stare up at the ceiling with a vacant look or count the bedbugs on the wallp aper; she kept her mind on her busines s, she talked about the things a man wants to hear when he's climbing over a woman. Where as Claude – well, with Claude there was always a certain delicacy, even when she got under the sheets with you. And her delicacy offended. Who wants a del icat e whore! Claude would even ask y ou to turn your face awa y when she squat ted over the bidet. All wrong! A man, when he's burning up with passion, wants to see things; he wants to see everyth ing, even how they make water . And while it's all very nice to know that a woman has a mind, literature coming from the cold corpse of a whore is the last thing to be served in bed. Germ aine had the right idea: she was ignorant and lusty, she put her heart and soul into her work. She was a whore all the way through – and that was her virtue!"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Easter came in like a frozen hare – but it was fairly warm in bed. Today it is lovely again and along the Champs-El ysées at twilight it is like an outdoor seraglio choked with dark-e yed houris. The trees are in full foliage and of a verdure so pure, so rich, that it seem s as though they were still wet and glistening with dew. From the Palais du Louvre to the Etoile it is like a piece of music for the pianoforte. For five days I have not touched the typewrit er nor looked at a book; nor have I had a single idea in my head except to go to the Amer ican Express. At nine this morning I was there, just as the doors were being opened, and again at one o'clock. No news. At four - thirty I dash out of the hotel, resolved to make a last-m inute stab at it. Just as I turn the corner I brush against Walter Pach. Since he doesn 't recognize me, and since I have nothing to say to him, I make no attempt to arrest him. Later, when I am stretching my legs in the Tuileries his figure rever ts to mind. He was a little stooped, pensive, with a sort of serene yet reserved smile on his face. I wonder , as I look up at this softly enameled sky, so faintl y tinted, which does not bulge today with heavy rain clouds but smiles like a piece of old china, I wonder what goes on in the mind of this man who transl ated the four thick volum es of the History of Art when he takes in this blissful cosm os with his drooping eye. Along the Champs - Elysées, ideas pouring from me like sweat. I ought to be rich enough to have a secret ary to whom I could dictate as I walk, because my best thoughts always come when I am away from the m achine. Walking along the Champs - Elysées I keep think ing of my really superb health. When I say \"health\" I mean optimism, to be truthful. Incurabl y optimistic! Still have one foot in the ninete enth centur y. I'm a bit retarded, like most Americ ans. Carl finds it disgu sting, this optimism. \"I have only to talk about a meal,\" he says, \"and you're radiant!\" It's a fact. The mere thought of a meal – another meal – rejuvenat es me. A meal! That means something to go on – a few solid hours of work, an erection possibly. I don't deny it. I have health, good solid, animal health. The only thing that stands between me and a future is a m eal, another meal. As for Carl, he's not himself these days. He's upset, his nerves are jangled. He says he's ill, and I believ e him, but I don't feel badly abou t it. I can 't. In fact, it makes me laugh. And that offends him, of course. Everything wounds him – my laugh ter, my hunger , my persistence, my insoucianc e, everything. One day he wants to blow his brains out because he can't stand this lousy hole of a Europe an y more; the next day he ta lks of going to Arizona \"where they look y ou square in the eye.\" \"Do it!\" I say. \"Do one thing or the other, you bastard, but don't try to cloud my health y eye with your melancholy breath!\" But that's just it! In Europ e one gets used to doing nothing. You sit on your ass and whine all day. You get cont aminated. You rot. Fundam entally Carl is a snob, an aristo cratic little prick who lives in a dementia praecox kingdo m all his own. \"I hate Paris!\" he whines. \"All these stupid peop le playing cards all day ... look at them! And the writing! What's the use of putting words together? I can be a writer without writing, can't I? What does it prove if I write a book? What do w e west with book s anyway? There are too m any book s already...\" My eye, but I've been all over that ground – years and years ago. I've lived out my"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"melancholy youth. I don't give a fuck any more what's behind me, or what's ahead of me. I'm healthy. Incurab ly health y. No sorrows, no regrets. No past, no future. The present is enough for me . Day by day. Today! Le bel aujou rd'hui! He has one day a week off, Carl, and on that day he's more miserable, if you can imagine it, than on any other day of the week. Though he profes ses to despise food, the only way he seems to enjoy himself on his day off is to order a big spread. Perhaps he does it for my benefit – I don't know , and I don't ask. If he chooses to add martyrdom to his list of vices, let him – it's O.K. with me. Anyway, last Tuesda y, after squander ing what he had on a big spread, he steers me to the Dôme, the last place in the world I would seek on m y day off. But one not onl y gets acquiesc ent here – one gets supine. Standing at the Dôme bar is Marlowe, soused to the ears. He's been on a bende r, as he calls it, for the last five days. That means a continuous drunk, a peregrina tion from one bar to anoth er, day and night without interrupt ion, and finall y a layoff at the Amer ican Hospital. Marlowe's bony emaciated face is nothing but a skull perfora ted by two deep sockets in which there are buried a pair of dead clams. His back is covered with sawdust – he has just had a little snooze in the water close t. In his coat pocket are the proofs for the next issue of his review , he was on his way to the printer with the proofs, it seems, when some one inveigl ed him to have a drink. He talks about it as though it happen ed months ago. He takes out the proof s and spreads them over the bar; they are full of coffee stains and dried spittle. He tries to read a poem which he had written in Greek, but the proof s are undecipher able. Then he decides to deliver a speech, in French, but the gérant puts a stop to it. Marlowe is piqued: his one ambition is to talk a French which even the garçon will understand. Of Old French he is a master; of the surrea lists he has made excellent translat ions; but to say a simple thing like \"get the hell out of here, you old prick!\" – that is beyond him. Nobod y understands Marlowe' s French, not even the whore s. For that matter, it's difficult enough to understand his English when he's under the weathe r. He blabb ers and spits like a confir med stutterer ... no sequenc e to his phrases. \" You pay! \" that's one thing he m anages to get out cl early. Even if he is fried to the hat some fine preservativ e instin ct always warns Marlowe when it is time to act. If there is any doubt in his mind as to how the drinks are going to be paid he will be sure to put on a stunt. The usual one is to pretend that he is going blind. Carl know s all his tricks by now, and so when Marlowe suddenl y claps his hands to his temples and begins to act it out Carl gives him a boot in the ass and says: \"Come out of it, you sap! You don't have to do that with m e!\" Whether it is a cunning piece of revenge or not, I don't know , but at any rate Marlowe is paying Carl back in good coin. Leaning over us confidenti ally he relates in a hoarse, croaking voice a piece of gossip which he picked up in the course of his peregr inations from bar to bar. Carl looks up in amazement. He's pale under the gills. Marlowe repeats the story with variations. Each time Carl wilts a little more. \"But that's impossible!\" he finally blurts out. \"No it ain't!\" croaks Marlowe. \"You're gonna lose your job ... I got it straight.\" Carl looks at me in despair . \"Is he shitting me, that bastard?\" he murmurs in my ear. And then aloud – \"Wha t am I going to do now? I'll never find anoth er job. It took m e a year to land th is one.\" This, apparen tly, is all that Marlowe has been waiting to hear. At last he has found someone worse off than himself. \"They be hard times!\" he croaks, and his bony skull glows with a cold, electric fire. Leaving the Dôme Marlowe expla ins between hiccups that he's got to return to San"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Francisco. He seems genuine ly touched now by Carl's helplessness. He proposes that Carl and I take over the review during his absence. \"I can trust you, Carl,\" he says. And then suddenl y he gets an attack, a real one this time. He almost collapses in the gutter. We haul him to a bist ro at the Boulevard Edgar - Quinet and sit him down. This time he's really got It – a blinding headach e that makes him squeal and grunt and rock himself to and fro like a dumb brute that's been struck by a sledge hammer. We spill a couple of Fernet - Branc as down his throa t, lay him out on the bench and cover his eyes with his muffler. He lies th ere groaning. In a li ttle while we hear hi m snoring. \"What about his proposition?\" says Carl. \"Should we take it up? He says he'll give me a thousand francs when he comes back. I kno w he won't, but what about i t?\" He looks at Marlowe sprawled out on the bench, lifts the muffer from his eyes, and puts it back again. Suddenl y a mischievous grin lights up his face. \"Listen, Joe,\" he says, beckoning me to move closer , \"we'll take him up on it. We'll take his lousy review over and we'll fuck hi m good and proper .\" \"What do you mean by that?\" \"Why we'll throw out all the other contributors and we'll fill it with our own shit – that's what!\" \"Yeah, but what kind of shit ?\" \"Any kind ... he won't be able to do anything about it. We'll fuck him good and proper . One good number and after that the magazin e'll be finished. Are you game, Joe?\" Grinning and chuck ling we lift Marlowe to his feet and haul him to Carl's room. When we turn on the lights there's a woman in the bed waiting for Carl. \"I forgot all about her,\" says Carl. We turn the cunt loose and shove Marlowe into bed. In a minute or so there's a knock at the door. It's Van Norden. He's all aflutter. Lost a plate of false teeth – at the Bal Nègre, he thinks. Anyway, we get to bed, the four of us. Marlowe stinks like a smok ed fish. In the morning Marlowe and Van Norden leave to search for the false teeth. Marlowe is blubbering. He im agines the y are his teeth."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"It is my last dinner at the dramatist's home. They have just rented a new piano, a concert grand. I meet Sylvester coming out of the florist's with a rubber plant in his arms. He asks me if I would carry it for him while he goes for the cigars. One by one I've fucked myself out of all these free meals which I had plann ed so careful ly. One by one the husbands turn against me, or the wives. As I walk along with the rubber plant in my arms I think of that night a few months back when the idea first occurred to me. I was sitting on a bench near the Coupole, fingering the wedding ring which I had tried to pawn off on a garçon at the Dôme. He had offered me six francs for it and I was in a rage about it. But the belly was getting the upper hand. Ever since I left Mona I had worn the ring on my pinkie. It was so much a part of me that it had never occurred to me to sell it. It was one of those orange- blossom affairs in white gold. Worth a dollar and a half once, maybe more. For three years we went along without a wedding ring and then one day when I was going to the pier to meet Mona I happened to pass a jewelr y windo w on Maiden Lane and the whole window was stuffed with wedding rings. When I got to the pier Mona was not to be seen. I waited for the last passenger to descend the gangplank, but no Mona. Finall y I asked to be shown the passenger list. Her name was not on it. I slipped the wedding ring on my pinkie and there it stayed. Once I left it in a public bath, but then I got it back again. One of the orange blossoms had fallen off. Anyway, I was sitting there on the bench with my head down, twiddling the ring, when sudden ly someon e clapped me on the back. To make it brief, I got a meal and a few francs besides. And then it occurred to me, like a flash, that no one would refuse a man a meal if only he had the courage to de mand it. I went immediately to a café and wrote a dozen letters. \"Would you let me have dinner with you once a week ? Tell me what day is most conveni ent for you.\" It worked lik e a char m. I was not only fed ... I was feasted. Every night I went home drunk. They couldn't do enough for me, these generous once- a-week souls. What happened to me between times was none of their affair. Now and then the thoughtful ones presented me with cigaret tes, or a little pin money. They were all obviousl y relieved when they realized that they would see me only once a week. And they were still more relieved when I said – \"it won't be nec essary any more.\" They never asked why. They congratul ated me, and that was all. Often the reason was I had found a better host; I could afford to scratch off the ones who were a pain in the ass. But that thought never occurred to the m. Finall y I had a stead y, solid progra m – a fixed schedule. On Tuesda ys I knew it would be this kind of a meal and on Frida ys that kind. Cronstadt, I knew , would have champagne for me and homemade apple pie. And Carl would invite me out, take me to a different restaurant each time, order rare wines, invite me to the theater afterward or take me to the Cirque Médrano. They were curious about one another , my hosts. Would ask me which place I liked best, who was the best cook, etc. I think I liked Cronstadt's joint best of all, perhaps because he chalk ed the meal up on the wall each time. Not that it eased my conscience to see what I owed him, because I had no intention of paying him back nor had he any illusions about being requi ted. No, it was the odd numbers which intrigued me. He used to figure it out to the last centime. If I was to pay in full I would have had to break a sou. His wife was a marvelous cook and she didn't give a fuck about those centimes Cronstadt added up. She took it out of me in carbon copies. A fact! If I hadn't any fresh carbons for her when I showed up, she was crestfal len. And for that I would have to take the little girl to the Luxe mbourg next day, play with her for two or three hours, a task which drove me wild because she spoke nothing but Hungar ian and French. They were a queer lot on the whole, my hosts..."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"At Tania's I look down on the spread from the balcony. Moldorf is there, sitting beside his idol. He is war ming his feet at the hearth, a monstrous look of grat itude in his water y eyes. Tania is running over the adagio. The adagio says very distinctly: no more word s of love! I am at the founta in again, watching the turtles pissing green milk. Sylvester has just come back from Broadwa y with a heart full of love. All night I was lying on a bench outside the mall while the globe was sprayed with warm turtle piss and the horses stiffened with priapic fury gallop ed like mad without ever touch ing the ground. All night long I smell the lilacs in the little dark room where she is taking down her hai r, the lilacs that I bought for for her as she went to meet Sylveste r. He came back with a heart full of love, she said, and the lilacs are in her hair, her mouth, they are choking her armpits. The room is swim ming with love and turtle piss and warm lilacs and the horses are galloping like mad. In the morn ing dirty teeth and scum on the windowpanes; the little gate that leads to the mall is locked. People are going to work and the shutters are rattling like coats of mail. In the bookstore opposite the fountain is the story of Lake Chad, the silent lizards, the gorgeous gamboge tints. All the letters I wrote her, drunken ones with a blunt stub, crazy ones with bits of charcoal, little pieces from bench to bench, firecra ckers, doilies, tutti - frutti; they will be going over them now, together, and he will compliment me one day.

And you want to know if you can play something for me. Yes, play something with those big thumbs of yours. Play the adagio since that's the only goddam ned thing you know . Play it, and then cut of f your big thum bs. That adagio! I don't know why she insists on playing it all the time. The old piano wasn't good enough for her; she had to rent a concert grand – for the adagio! When I see her big thumbs pressing the keyboard and that silly rubber plant beside me I feel like that madman of the North who threw his clothes away and, sitting naked in the wintr y bough s, threw nuts down into the herring - frozen sea. There is something exasper ating about this movement, something abort ively melanchol y about it, as if it had been written in lava, as if it had the color of lead and milk mixed. And Sylveste r, with his head cocked to one side like an auctione er, Sylvester says: \"Play that other one you were practising today.\" It's beautifu l to have a smoking jacket, a good cigar and a wife who plays the piano. So relaxing. So lenitive. Betwe en the acts you go out for a smok e and a brea th of fresh air. Yes, her fing ers are very supple, extraordin ary supple. She does batik work too. Would you like to try a Bulgarian cigaret te? I say, pigeon breast, what's that other movement I like so well? The scherzo! Ah, yes, the scherzo! Excellent. the scherzo!

The cheek of him! To think that he can lie beside that furnace I stoked for him and do nothing but make water! My God, man, you ought to get down on your knees and thank me.

I'm flattering the ass off you, can't you tell? While I listen to your crap she's got her hand on me – but you don't see that. You think I like to suffer – that's my role, you say. O.K. Ask her about it! She'll tell you how I suffer. \"You're cancer and deliriu m,\" she said over the phone the other day. She's got it now, the cancer and delirium, and soon you'll have to pick the scabs. Her veins are bursting, I tell you, and your talk is all sawdu st. No matter how much you piss away you'll never plug up the holes. What did Mr. Wren say? Words are lone liness. I left a couple of words for you on the tablecloth last night – you covered them with your elbows. He's put a fence around her as if she were a dirty, stinking bone of a saint. If he only had the courage to say \"Take her!\" perhaps a miracle would occur. Just that. Take her! and I swear everything would come out all right. Besides, maybe I wouldn't take her – did that ever occur to him, I wonder ? Or I might take her for a while and hand her back, imp roved. But putting up a fence around her, that won't work. You can't put a fence around a human being. It ain't done any more... You think, you poor, withered bastard, that I'm no good for her, that I might pollu te her, desecrate her. You don't know how palatable is a polluted woman, how a change of semen can make a woman bloom ! You think a heart full of love is enough, and perhaps it is, for the right woman, but you haven't got a heart any more ... you are nothing but a big, empty bladder . You are sharpen ing your teeth and cultiv ating your growl. You run at her heels like a watchdog and you piddle everywhere. She didn't take you for a watchdog ... she took you for a poet. You were a poet once, she said. And now what are you? Courage, Sylvester, courage! Take the microphone out of your pants. Put your hind leg down and stop making water everywhere. Courage I say, because she's ditched you alread y. She's conta minated, I tell you, and you might as well take down the fence.

I have had to share myself with others, princip ally with some crazy Russians, a drunken Dutch man, and a"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"big Bulgarian woman named Olga. Of the Russians there are chiefl y Eugene and Anatole. It was just a few days ago that Olga got out of the hospital where she had her tubes burned out and lost a little excess weight. However she doesn't look as if she had gone through much suffering. She weighs almost as much as a camel-backed locomotive; she drips with perspirat ion, has halitosis, and still wears her Circassian wig that looks like excelsio r. She has two big warts on her chin from which there sprouts a clump of little hairs; she is growing a must ache. The day after Olga was released from the hospita l she commenced making shoes again. At six in the morning she is at her bench ; she knocks out two pairs of shoes a day. Eugene complains that Olga is a burden, but the truth is that Olga is supporting Eugene and his wife with her two pairs of shoes a day. If Olga doesn't work there is no food. So everyone endeavors to pull Olga to bed on time, to give her enough food to keep her going, etc. Every meal starts off with soup. Whether it be onion soup, tomato soup, vegetable soup, or what not, the soup always tastes the same. Mostly it tastes as if a dish rag had been stewed in it – slightly sour, mildewed, scummy. I see Eugen e hiding it away in the commode after the meal. It stays there, rotting away, until the next meal. The butter , too, is hidden awa y in the co mmode; after three days it tast es like the big toe of a cad aver. The smell of rancid butter frying is not particu larly appetizing, espec ially when the cooking is done in a room in which there is not the slightest form of ventilation. No sooner than I open the door I feel ill. But Eugen e, as soon as he hears me coming, usually opens the shutters and pulls back the bedsheet which is strung up like a fishnet to keep out the sunligh t. Poor Eugene! He looks about the room at the few sticks of furniture, at the dirty bedsheets and the wash basin with the dirty water still in it, and he says: \"I am a slave!\" Every day he says it, not once, but a dozen times. And then he takes his guit ar fro m the wall and sings. But about the smell of rancid butter... There are good associat ions too. When I think of this rancid butter I see myself standing in a little, old - world court yard, a very smelly. very drear y court yard. Through the cracks in the shutters strange figures peer out at me ... old women with shawls, dwarfs, rat - faced pimps, bent Jews, midinet tes, beard ed idiots. They totter out in to the court yard to draw water or to rinse the slop pai ls. One da y Eugene asked me if I would empty the pail for him. I took it to the corner of the yard. There was a hole in the ground and some dirty paper lying around the hole. The little well was slimy with excre ment, which in English is shit. I tipped the pail and there was a foul, gurgling splash followed by anoth er and unexpe cted splash. When I returned the soup was dished out. All through the meal I thought of my toothbrush – it is getting old and the bristles get caught in m y teeth. When I sit down to eat I always sit near the window . I am afraid to sit on the other side of the table – it is too close to the bed and the bed is crawling. I can see bloodstains on the gray sheets if I look that way, but I try not to look that way. I look out on the court yard where they are rinsing the slop pails. The meal is never complete without music. As soon as the cheese is passed around Eugene jumps up and reaches for the guitar which hangs over the bed. It is always the same song. He says he has fifteen or sixteen songs in his reper toire, but I have never heard more than three. His favorit e is Cha rmant poème d'amou r. It is full of angois se and tristesse."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"In the afternoon we go to the cinema which is cool and dark. Eugene sits at the piano in the big pit and I sit on a bench up front. The house is empty, but Eugene sings as if he had for audien ce all the crowned heads of Europe. The garden door is open and the odor of wet leaves sops in and the rain blends with Eugene's angois se and tristesse. At midnigh t, after the specta tors have satura ted the hall with perspira tion and foul breaths, I return to sleep on a bench. The exit light, swim ming in a halo of tobacco smoke, sheds a faint light on the lower corner of the asbestos curtain ; I close my eyes every night on an artif icial eye... Standing in the court yard with a glass eye; only half the world is intelligible. The stones are wet and moss y and in the crevices are black toads. A big door bars the entranc e to the cellar ; the steps are slipper y and soiled with bat dung. The door bulges and sags, the hinges are falling off, but there is an enameled sign on it, in perfec t condit ion, which says: \"Be sure to close the door.\" Why close the door? I can't make it out. I look again at the sign but it is removed; in its place there is a pane of colored glass. I take out my artificial eye, spit on it and polish it with my handkerch ief. A woman is sitting on a dais above an immense careen desk; she has a snake around her neck. The entire room is lined with books and strange fish swim ming in color ed globes; there are maps and charts on the wall, maps of Paris before the plague, maps of the antique world, of Knos sos and Carth age, of Carthage before and after the salting. In the corner of the room I see an iron bedstead and on it a corpse is lying; the woman gets up wearil y, removes the corpse from the bed and absent - mindedly throw s it out the window . She returns to the huge carven desk, takes a goldf ish from the bowl and swallows it. Slowl y the room begins to revolve and one by one the continen ts slide into the sea; only the woman is left, but her body is a mass of geograph y. I lean out the windo w and the Eiffel Tower is fizzing champagne; it is built entirely of numbers and shrouded in black lace. The sewers are gurgling furiousl y. There are nothing but roofs everywhere, laid out with execr able geom etric cunning. I have been ejected from the world like a cartridge. A deep fog has settled down, the earth is smeared with frozen grease. I can feel the city palpitating, as if it were a heart just removed from a warm body. The windows of my hotel are fester ing and there is a thick, acrid stench as of chemicals burning. Look ing into the Seine I see mud and desolation, street lamps drowning, men and women choking to death, the bridges covered with house s, slaugh terhouses of love. A man is standing against a wall with an accordion strapped to his belly; his hands are cut off at the wrists, but the accordion writhes between his stum ps like a sack of snakes. The universe has d wind led; it is onl y a block long and there are no stars, no trees, no rivers. The peopl e who live here are dead; they make chairs which other people sit on in their dreams.

It is one of those streets which by good fortune the municipality has forgotten to pave. Huge cobblestones spreading convexl y from one side of the street to the other. Only one block long and narrow . The Hôtel Pretty is on this street. There is a little church, too, on the Rue Amélie. It looks as though it were made especi ally for the President of the Republic and his private family. It's good occasiona lly to see a m odest little church. Paris is full of pom pous cathedr als. Pont Alexandre III. A great winds wept space approach ing the bridge. Gaunt, bare trees mathematically fixed in their iron grates; the gloom of the Invalides welling out of the dome and overflowing the dark streets adjacent to the Square. The morgue of poetr y. They have him where they want him now, the great warrior , the last big man of Europe. He sleeps soundl y in his grani te bed. No fear of him turning over in his grave. The door s are well bolted, the lid is on tigh t. Sleep, Napoleon! It was not y our ideas the y wanted, it was only your corpse! The river is still swollen, mudd y, streaked with lights.

I remember passing this way the other morning on my way to the Americ an Express, knowing in advan ce that there would be no mail for me, no check, no cable, nothing, nothing. A wagon from the Galeries Lafayette was rumb ling over the bridge. The rain had stopped and the sun breaking through the soapy clouds touch ed the glistening rubble of roofs with a cold fire. I recall now how the driver leaned out and looked up the river toward Passy way. Such a healthy, simple, approving glance, as if he were saying to himself: \"Ah, spring is coming!\" And God know s, when spring comes to Paris the humblest mortal alive must feel that he dwells in paradise. But it was not only this – it was the intimacy with which his eye rested upon the scene. It was his Paris. A man does not need to be rich, nor even a citizen, to feel this way about Paris. Paris is filled with poor peopl e – the proudest and filthiest lot of beggars that ever walked the earth, it seems to me. And yet they give the illusion of being at home. It is that which distingu ishes the Parisian from all other metropo litan souls. When I think of New York I have a very different feeling. New York makes even a rich man feel his unim portance. New York is cold, glittering, malign. The buildings dominate. There is a sort of atomic frenz y to the activity going on; the more furious the pace, the more diminished the spirit. A constan t ferment, but it might just as well be going on in a test tube. Nobod y know s what it's all about. Nobod y directs the energy. Stupendous. Bizarre. Baffling. A tremendous reactive urge, but absolute ly uncoordinat ed. When I think of this city where I was born and raised, this Manhat tan that Whitman sang of, a blind, white rage licks my guts. New York! The white prisons, the sidewalks swarming with maggots, the breadlines, the opium joints that are built like palaces, the kikes that are there, the lepers, the thugs, and above all, the ennui, the monoton y of faces, streets, legs, houses, skyscrapers, meals, posters, jobs, crimes, loves... A whole city erected over a hollow pit of nothingness. Meaningless. Absolutely meaningless. And Forty - second Street! The top of the world, they call it. Wher e's the botto m then?

No, I prefer to be a poor man of Europe. God knows, I am poor enough; it only remains to be a man. Last week I thought the proble m of living was about to be solved, thought I was on the way to becoming self - supporting. It happened that I ran across another Russian – Serge is his name. He lives in Suresnes where there is a little colon y of émigrés and run - down artists. Before the revolu tion Serge was a cap tain in the Imperial Guard; he stands six foot three in his stockinged feet and drinks vodka like a fish. Hi s father was an ad miral, or something like th at, on the battleship \"Pote mkin.\" I met Serge under rather peculiar circumstanc es. Sniffing about for food I found myself toward noon the other day in the neighbourhood of the Folies - Bergère – the back entranc e, that is to say, in the narrow little lane with an iron gate at one end. I was dawdling about the stage entran ce, hoping vaguel y for a casual brush with one of the butterf lies, when an open truck pulls up to the sidewalk. Seeing me standing there with my hands in my pockets the driver , who was Serge, asks me if I would give him a hand unloading the iron barrels. When he learns that I am an American and that I'm broke he almost weeps with joy. He has been looking high and low for an English teacher, it seems. I help him roll the barre ls of insect icide insid e and I look my fill at the butterflies fluttering about the wings. The inciden t takes on strange proportions to me – the empty house, the sawdust dolls bouncing in the wings, the barre ls of germicide, the battleship \"Potem kin\" – above all, Serge's gentleness. He is big and tender , a man every inch of him, but with a wo man's heart. In the café nearb y – Café des Artist es – he proposes immediately to put me up; says he will put a m attress on the floor in the hallwa y. For the lessons he sa ys he will give m e a meal every day, a big Russian meal, or if for any reason the meal is lacking then five francs. It sounds w onderful to m e – wonderful. The only question is, ho w wil l I get from Suresnes to the Amer ican Express ever y day? Serge insists that we begin at once – he gives me the carfar e to get out to Suresnes in the evening. I arrive a little before dinner , with my knapsack, in order to give Serge a lesson. There are some guests on hand already – seems as though they always eat in a crowd, ever ybody chipp ing in. There are eight of us at the table – and three dogs. The dogs eat first. They eat oatmeal. Then we commence. We eat oatmeal too – as an hors d'œuvre. \"Chez nou s,\" says Serge, with a twinkle in his eye, \"C'e st pour les chiens, les Quaker Oats. Ici pour le gent leman. Ça va.\" After the oatmeal, mushroo m soup and veget ables; after that bacon omelet, fruit, red wine, vodka, coffee, cigarettes. Not bad, the Russian meal. Everyone talks with his mouth full. Toward the end of the mea Serge's wife, who is a lazy slut of an Armenian, flops on the couch and begins to nibble bonbon s. She fishes around in the box with her fat fingers, nibbles a tiny piece to see if there is any juice inside, and then throws it on the floor for th e dogs. The meal over, the guests rush away. They rush away precipi tously, as if they feared a plague. Serge and I are left with the dogs – his wife has fallen asleep on the couch. Serge moves about unconcern edly, scraping the garbag e for the dogs. \"Dogs like very much,\" he says. \"Very good for dogs. Little dog he has worms ... he is too young yet.\""},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"He bends down to exam ine some white worms lying on the carpet between the dog's paws. Tries to explain about the worms in Engl ish, but his vocabular y is lacking. Fina lly he consults the dictionar y. \"Ah,\" he says, looking at me exultantly, \"tapeworms! \" My respon se is evident ly not very intelligent. Serge is confused. He gets down on his hands and knees to exam ine them better. He picks one up and lays it on the table beside the fruit. \"Huh, him not very beeg,\" he grunts. \"Next lesson you learn me worms, no? You are gude teache r. I make progress with y ou...\" Lying on the mattress in the hallway the odor of the germ icide stifles me. A pungent, acrid odor that seems to invade every pore of my body. The food begins to repeat on me – the Quaker Oats, the mushroom s, the bacon, the fried apples. I see the little tapeworm lying beside the fruit and all the varieties of worms that Serge drew on the tablec loth to explain what was the matter with the dog. I see the empty pit of the Folies - Bergère and in every crevice there are cockroach es and lice and bedbugs; I see peopl e scratching themselv es frantically, scratch ing and scratching until the blood comes. I see the worms crawling over the scener y like an army of red ants, devouring everything in sight. I see the chorus girls throwing away their gauze tunics and running through the aisles naked; I see the specta tors in the pit throwing off their clothes also and scratching each other like monkeys. I try to quiet myself. After all, this is a home I've found, and there's a meal waiting for me every day. And Ser ge is a brick, there's no doubt about that. But I can't sleep. It's lik e going to sleep in a morgue. The mattress is saturat ed with embalming fluid. It's a morgue for lice, bedbugs, cockro aches, tapeworms. I can't stand it. I won 't stand it! After all I'm a man, not a louse. In the morning I wait for Serge to load the truck. I ask him to take me in to Paris. I haven't the heart to tell him I'm leaving. I leave the knapsack behind, with the few things that were left me. When we get to the Place Péreir e I jump out. No particu lar reason for getting off here. No particular reason for anything. I'm free – that's the main thing... Light as a bird I flit about from one quarter to another . It's as though I had been released from prison. I look at the world with new eyes. Everything interests me profoundl y. Even trifles. On the Rue du Faubour g Poissonnière I stop before the windo w of a physical culture estab lishm ent. There are photographs showing speci mens of manhood \"before and after.\" All frogs. Some of them are nude, except for a pince- nez or a beard. Can't understand how these birds fa ll for para llel bars and dumb - bells. A frog should have just a wee bit of a paunch, like the Baron de Charlus. He should wear a beard and a pince - nez, but he should never be photographed in the nude. He should wear twinkling paten t - leather boots and in the breast pocke t of his sack coat there should be a white handkerchi ef protruding about three - quarters of an inch above the vent. If possible, he should have a red ribbon in his lapel, through the buttonhole. He should wear pajam as on going to bed. Approach ing the Place Clich y toward evening I pass the little whore with the wooden stump who stands opposite the Gaumont Palace day in and day out. She doesn't look a day over eigh teen. Has her regular custo mers, I suppo se. After midnight she stands there in her black rig rooted to the spot. Back of her is the little alleyway that blazes like an inferno. Passing her now with a light heart she re minds me somehow of a goose tied to a stake, a goose with a diseased liver, so that the world may have pâté de foie gra s . Must be strange taking that wooden stump to bed with you. One imagines all sorts of things –"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"splinters, et c. However , ever y man to his taste! Going down the Rue des Dames I bump into Peckover , another poor devil who works on the paper. He complains of getting only three or four hours' sleep a night – has to get up at eight in the morning to work at a dentist's office. It isn't for the money he's doing it, so he expla ins – it's for to buy himself a set of false teeth. \"It's hard to read proof when you're dropping with sleep,\" he says. \"The wife, she thinks I've got a cinch of it. What would we do if you lost your job? she says.\" But Peckover doesn't give a damn about the job; it doesn't even allow him spending money. He has to save his cigarette butts and use them for pipe tobacco. His coat is held together with pins. He has halitosis and his hands sweat. And only three hours ' sleep a night. \"It's no way to treat a man,\" he says. \"And that boss of mine, he bawls the piss out of me if I miss a semicolon.\" Speaking of his wife he adds: \"That woman of mine, she's got no fucking gratitude, I tell you!\" In parting I manage to worm a franc fifty out of him. I try to squeeze another fifty centimes out of him but it's impossible. Anyway I've got enough for a coffee and croissants . Near the Gare St. Lazar e there's a bar with reduced prices. As luck would have it I find a ticket in the lavabo for a concert. Light as a feather now I go there to the Salle Gaveau. The usher looks ravag ed because I overlook giving him his little tip. Ever y time he passes me he looks at me inquir ingly, as if perhaps I will sudden ly remember. It's so long since I've sat in the compan y of well - dressed people that I feel a bit panic- stricken. I can still smell the formaldeh yde. Perhaps Serge makes deliver ies here too. But nobod y is scratch ing himself, thank God. A faint odor of perfum e ... very faint. Even before the music begins there is that bored look on people's faces. A polite form of self-i mposed tortur e, the concert. For a moment, when the conduc tor raps with his little wand, there is a tense spasm of concen tration followed almost immediately by a general slump, a quiet vege table sort of repose induced by the stead y, unint errupted drizzl e from the orchestr a. My mind is curiously alert; it's as though my skull had a thousand mirrors inside it. My nerves are taut, vibran t! the notes are like glass balls dancing on a million jets of water. I've never been to a concert before on such an empty belly. Nothing escapes me, not even the tiniest pin falling. It's as though I had no clothes on and every pore of my body was a window and all the windo ws open and the light flooding my gizzards. I can feel the light curving under the vault of my ribs and my ribs hang there over a hollow nave trembling with reverber ations. How long this lasts I have no idea; I have lost all sense of time and place. After what seem s like an eterni ty there follows an interva l of semiconsciousness balan ced by such a calm that I feel a great lake inside me, a lake of iridescent sheen, cool as jelly; and over this lake, rising in great swooping spirals, there emerge flocks of birds of passage with long slim legs and brilliant plum age. Flock after flock surge up from the cool, still surface of the lake and, passing under my clavicles, lose themselves in the white sea of space. And then slowl y, very slowly, as if an old woman in a white cap were going the round s of my body, slowl y the windo ws are closed and my organs drop back into place. Sudden ly the lights flare up and the man in the white box whom I had taken for a Turkish officer turns out to be a woman with a flowerpot on her head. There is a buzz now and all those who want to cough, cough to their heart's content. There is the noise of feet shuffling and seats slamming, the stead y, frittering noise of people moving about aimlessly, of peopl e fluttering their programs and pretend ing to"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"read and then dropping their program s and scuffling under their seats, thankfu l for even the slightest accident which will preven t them from asking themselv es what they were thinking about because if they knew they were thinking about nothing they would go mad. In the harsh glare of the lights they look at each other vacuousl y and there is a strange tenseness with which they stare at one anothe r. And the moment the conductor raps again they fall back into a cataleptic state – they scratch themselves unconsciousl y or they remember sudden ly a show windo w in which there was displa yed a scarf or a hat; they remember every detail of that windo w with amazing clarity, but where it was exact ly, that they can't recall; and that bothers them, keeps them wide awake, restless, and the y listen now with redoubled at tention because they are wide awake and no ma tter how wonderful the music is they will not lose consciousness of that show window and that scarf that was hanging there, or the hat. And this fierce attentiven ess communicates itself; even the orchestra seems galvani zed into an extraord inary alertn ess. The second numb er goes off like a top – so fast indeed that when suddenl y the music ceases and the lights go up some are stuck in their seats like carro ts, their jaws working convulsivel y, and if you suddenl y shouted in their ear Brah ms, Beetho ven, Mendele ev, Her zegov ina, they would answer without thinking – 4, 967, 289. By the time we get to the Debuss y number the atmosphere is completely poisoned. I find myself wondering what it feels like, during intercourse, to be a woman – whether the pleasure is keener , etc. Try to imagine something penetr ating my groin, but have only a vague sensation of pain. I try to focus, but the music is too slipper y. I can think of nothing but a vase slowl y turning and the figures dropping off into space. Finall y there is only light turning, and how does light turn, I ask myself. The man next to me is sleeping soundl y. He looks like a broker , with his big paunch and his waxed mustache. I like him thus. I like espec ially that big paunch and all that went into the making of it. Why shouldn't he sleep soundl y? If he wants to listen he can always rustle up the price of a ticket. I notice that the better dressed they are the more soundl y they sleep. They have an easy conscien ce, the rich. If a poor man dozes off, even for a few second s, he feels m ortified; he imagines that he has com mitted a crime aga inst the composer . In the Spanish number the house was electrified. Everybody sat on the edge of his seat – the drums woke them up. I thought when the drums started it would keep up forever . I expect ed to see people fall out of the boxes or throw their hats away. There was something heroi c about it and he could have driven us stark mad, Ravel, if he had wanted to. But that's not Ravel. Suddenl y it all died down. It was as if he remembered, in the midst of his antics, that he had on a cutawa y suit. He arrested himself. A great mistake, in my humble opinion. Art consists in going the full length. If you start with the drums you have to end with dynamite, or TNT. Rave l sacrific ed something for form, for a veget able that people m ust digest before going to bed. My though ts are spreading. The music is slipping away from me, now that the drums have ceased. People everywhere are composed to order . Under the exit light is a Werther sunk in despair; he is leaning on his two elbow s, his eyes are glazed. Near the door, huddled in a big cape, stands a Spaniard with a sombrero in his hand. He looks as if he were posing for the \"Balzac\" of Rodin. From the neck up he suggests Buffalo Bill. In the gallery opposite me, in the front row, sits a woman with her legs spread wide apart; she looks as though she had lockjaw , with her neck thrown back and disloca ted.

Circu mstan ces had pla ced me in a position where fortun ately I could be of aid to them; I secured jobs for them, I harbored them, and I fed them when necessar y. They were very grateful, I must say; so much so, in fact that they made my life miserable with their attentions. Two of them were saints, if I know what a saint is; particularl y Gupte who was found one morning with his throat cut from ear to ear. In a little boarding house in Greenwi ch Village he was found one morning stretched out stark naked on the bed, his flute beside him, and his throat gashed, as I say, from ear to ear. It was never discovered whether he had been murder ed or whether he had committed suicid e. But that's neither here nor ther e... I'm think ing back to the chain of circumstan ces which has brought me finall y to Nanantat ee's place. Thinking how strange it is that I should have forgotten all about Nanantat ee until the other day when lying in a shabb y hotel room on the Rue Cels. I'm lying there on the iron bed thinking what a zero I have become, what a ciphe r, what a nullity, when bango! out pops the word: NONENTITY! That's what we called him in New York – N onent ity. Mister Nonenti ty. I'm lying on the floor now in that gorgeous suite of rooms he boasted of when he was in New York. Nanant atee is playing the good Samaritan; he has given me a pair of itchy blankets, horse blankets they are, in which I curl up on the dusty floor. There are little jobs to do every hour of the day – that is, if I am foolish enough to remain indoors. In the morning he wakes me rudel y in order to have me prepare the veget ables for his lunch: onions, garlic, beans, etc. His friend, Kepi, warns m e not to ea t the food – he sa ys it's bad. Bad or good what difference? Food! That's all that matters. For a little food I am quite willing to sweep his carpets with a broken broom, to wash his clothes and to scrape the crum bs off the floor as soon as he has finished eating. He's become absolutel y immaculate since my arrival: everything has to be dusted now, the chairs must be arrang ed a certain way, the clock must ring, the toilet must flush proper ly... A crazy Hindu if ever there was one! And parsimonious as a string bean. I'll have a great laugh over it when I get out of his clutch es, but just now I'm a prisoner , a man without caste, an untouchabl e... If I fail to come back at night and roll up in the horse blank ets he says to me on arriving : \"Oh, so you didn't die then? I thought you had di ed.\" And though he knows I'm absolutel y pennil ess he tells me every day about some cheap room he has just discovered in the neighborhood. \"But I can't take a room yet, you know that,\" I say. And then, blinking his eyes like a Chink, he answers smoo thly: \"Oh, yes, I forgot that you had no money. I am always forgetting, Endree... But when the cable comes... when Miss Mona sends you the money, then you will come with me to look for a room , eh?\" And in the next breath he urges me to stay as long as I wish – \"six months ... seven months, Endree ... you are ver y good for me here.\" Nanantat ee is one of the Hindus I never did anything for in America. He represen ted himself to me as a wealth y merchan t, a pearl merchant, with a luxurious suite of rooms on the Rue Lafayette, Paris, a villa in Bombay, a bunga low in Darjeeling. I could see from first glance that he was a half-wit, but then half - wits sometimes have the genius to amass a fortune. I didn't know that he paid his hotel bill in New York by leaving a couple of fat pearls in the proprietor's hands. It seems amusing to me now that this little duck once swaggered about the lobby of that hotel in New York with an ebony cane,"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"bossing the bellhops around, ordering luncheons for his guests, calling up the porter for theater tickets, renting a taxi by the day, etc., etc., all without a sou in his pocket. Just a string of fat pearls around his neck which he cashed one by one as time wore on. And the fatuous way he used to pat me on the back, thank me for being so good to the Hindu boys – \"they are all very intelligent boys, Endree ... very intelligent!\" Telling me that the good lord so-and-so would repay me for my kindness. That explains now why they used to giggle so, these intelligent Hindu boys, when I suggested that they touch Nanantat ee for a five - spot. Curious now how the good lord so - and - so is requiting me for my benevolenc e. I'm nothing but a slave to this fat little duck. I'm at his beck and call continu ally. He needs me here – he tells me so to my face. When he goes to the crap - can he shouts: \"Endree, bring me a pitcher of water , please. I must wipe myself.\" He wouldn't think of using toilet paper, Nananta tee. Must be against his religion. No, he calls for a pitcher of water and a rag. He's delica te, the fat little duck. Sometimes when I'm drinking a cup of pale tea in which he has dropped a rose leaf he comes alongside of me and lets a loud fart, right in my face. He never says \"Excuse me!\" The word must be missing from his Gujarat i dict ionar y. The day I arrived at Nananta tee's apartment he was in the act of perfor ming his ablutions, that is to say, he was standing over a dirty bowl trying to work his crooked arm around toward the back of his neck. Beside the bowl was a brass goblet which he used to change the water. He requested me to be silent during the ceremony. I sat there silent ly, as I was bidden, and watched him as he sang and prayed and spat now and then into the wash - bowl. So this is the wonderful suite of rooms he talked about in New York. The Rue Lafayette! It sounded like an importan t street to me back there in New York. I though t only millionaires and pearl merchan ts inhabi ted the street. It sound s wonderfu l, the Rue Lafayette, when you're on the other side of the water . So does Fifth Avenue, when you're over here. One can't imagine what dumps there are on these swell streets. Anyway, here I am at last, sitting in the gorgeous suite of rooms on the Rue Lafayette. And this crazy duck with his crooked arm is going through the ritual of washing himself. The chair on which I'm sitting is broken, the bedste ad is falling apart, the wallp aper is in tatters, there is an open valise under the bed crammed with dirty wash. From where I sit I can glance at the miserabl e court yard down below where the aristocra cy of the Rue Lafayette sit and smoke their clay pipes. I wonder now, as he chants the doxolog y, what that bungalow in Darjeeling looks like. It's interminable, his chanting and pra ying. He explains to me that he is obliged to wash in a certain prescrib ed way – his religion demands it. But on Sunda ys he takes a bath in the tin tub – the Great I AM will wink at that, he says. When he's dressed he goes to the cupboard, kneels before a little idol on the third shelf, and repeats the mumbo jumbo. If you pray like that every day, he says, nothing will happen to you. The good lord what's his name never forgets an obedien t servant. And then he show s me the crooked arm which he got in a taxi accid ent on a day doubtless when he had neglected to rehearse the complete song and dance. His arm looks like a broken compass; it's not an arm any more, but a knuckl ebone with a shank attached. Since the arm has been repaired he has developed a pair of swollen glands in the armpit – fat little glands, exactly like a dog's testicles. While bemoaning his plight he remembers suddenl y that the doctor had recommended a more liberal diet. He begs me at once to sit down and make up a menu with plent y of fish and meat. \"And what about oysters, Endre e – for le pet it frère? \" But all this is only to make an impression on"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"me. He hasn't the slightest intent ion of buying himself oysters, or meat, or fish. Not as long as I am there, at least. For the time being we are going to nourish ourselves on lentils and rice and all the dry foods he has stored away in the attic. And the butter he bought last week, that won't go to waste either. When he commences to cure the butter the smell is unbearabl e. I used to run out at first, when he started frying the butter, but now I stick it out. He'd be only too deligh ted if he could make me vomit up my meal – that would be something else to put away in the cupboard along with the dry bread and the moldy cheese and the little grease cakes that he makes himself out of the stale milk and the rancid but ter. For the last five years, so it seems, he hasn't done a stroke of work, hasn't turned over a penny. Business has gone to smash. He talks to me about pearls in the Indian ocean – big fat ones on which you can live for a lifetime. The Arabs are ruining the business, he says. But meanwhil e he prays to the lord so - and - so every day, and that sustains him. He's on a marvelous footing with the deity: know s just how to cajole him, how to wheedle a few sous out of him. It's a pure commercial relationship. In exchang e for the flummery before the cabin et every day he gets his ration of beans and garlic, to say nothing of the swollen testicles under his arm. He is confident that everything will turn out well in the end. The pearls will sell again some day, maybe five years hence, maybe twent y – when the Lord Boom aroom wishes it. \"And when the business goes, Endree, you will get ten per cent – for writing the letters. But first Endree, you must write the letter to find out if we can get credit from India. It will take about six months for an answer, maybe seven mo nths ... the boats are not fast in India.\" He has no concept ion of time at all, the little duck. When I ask him if he has slept well he will say: \"Ah, yes, Endree, I sleep ver y well ... I sleep so metimes ninet y - two hour s in three days.\" Mornings he is usuall y too weak to do any work. His arm! That poor broken crutch of an arm! I wonder sometimes when I see him twist ing it around the back of his neck how he will ever get it into place again. If it weren't for that little paunch he carries he'd remind me of one of those contort ionists at the Cirque Medrano. All he needs is to break a leg. When he sees me sweeping the carpet, when he sees what a cloud of dust I raise, he begins to cluck like a pygmy. \"Good! Very good, Endre e. And now I will pick up the knots.\" That means that there are a few crumbs of dust which I have overlook ed; it is a polite way he has of being sarcastic. Afternoons there are always a few croni es from the pearl market dropping in to pay him a visit. They're all very suave, butter - tongued bastards with soft, doelike eyes; they sit around the table drinking the perfu med tea with a loud hissing noise while Nanantat ee jumps up and down like a jack - in-the - box or points to a crumb on the floor and says in his smoo th slipper y voice – \"Will you please to pick that up, Endree.\" When the guests arrive he goes unctuousl y to the cupboard and gets out the dry crusts of bread which he toasted maybe a week ago and which taste strongl y now of the moldy wood. Not a crumb is thrown away. If the bread gets too sour he takes it downstairs to the concier ge who, so he says, has been very kind to him. According to him, the conci erge is deligh ted to get the stale bread – she m akes bread pudding with it. One day my friend Anatol e came to see me. Nanantat ee was deligh ted. Insisted that Anatole stay for tea. Insisted that he try little grease cakes and the stale bread. \"You must come every day,\" he says, \"and teach me Russian. Fine langu age, Russian ... I"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"want to speak it. How do you say that again, Endre e – borsht ? You will write that down for me, please, Endree...\" And I must write it on the typewri ter, no less, so that he can observe my technique. He bought the typewr iter, after he had collected on the bad arm, because the doctor recommended it as a good exerc ise. But he got tired of the typewrit er shortly – it was an English typewri ter. When he learned that Anatole played the mandolin he said: \"Very good! You must come every day and teach me the music. I will buy a mandolin as soon as business is better. It is good for my arm.\" The next day he borro ws a phonograph from the concier ge. \"You will please teach me to dance, Endree. My stomach is too big.\" I am hoping that he will buy a porterhouse steak some day so that I can say to him: \"You will please bite i t for m e, Mister Nonenti ty. My teeth are not strong!\" As I said a moment ago, ever since my arriva l he has become extraordinar ily meticulous. \"Yesterd ay,\" he says, \"you made three mistakes, Endre e. First, you forgot to close the toilet door and so all night it makes boom - boom; second, you left the kitchen windo w open and so the windo w is cracked this morning. And you forgot to put out the milk bottle! Alwa ys you will put out the milk bottle please, before you go to bed, and in the m orning y ou will please bring in the bread.\" Every day his friend Kepi drops in to see if any visitors have arrived from India. He waits for Nananta tee to go out and then he scurries to the cupboard and devours the sticks of bread that are hidd en away in a glass jar . The food is no good, he insists, but he puts it away like a rat. Kepi is a scrounger , a sort of human tick who fastens himself to the hide of even the poorest compatriot. From Kepi's standpoint they are all nabobs. For a Manila cheroot and the price of a drink he will suck any Hindu' s ass. A Hindu's, mind you, but not an English man's. He has the address of every whorehouse in Paris, and the rates. Even from the ten franc joints he gets his little commission. And he knows the shortest way to any place you want to go. He will ask you first if you want to go by taxi; if you say no, he will suggest the bus, and if that is too high then the street car or the metro. Or he will offer to walk you there and save a franc or two, knowing very well that it will be necessary to pass a tabac on the way and that you will please be so good as to bu y me a little cheroot. Kepi is interesting, in a way, because he has absolute ly no ambition except to get a fuck every night. Every penny he makes, and they are damned few, he squanders in the dance halls. He has a wife and eight children in Bombay, but that does not prevent him from propo sing marriage to any little femme de chamb re who is stupid and credulous enough to be taken in by him. He has a little room on the Rue Condorcet for which he pays sixty francs a month. He papered it all himself. Very proud of it, too. He uses violet-colored ink in his fountain pen because it lasts longe r. He shines his own shoes, presses his own pants, does his own laundr y. For a little cigar, a cheroo t, if you please, he will escort you all over Paris. If you stop to look at a shirt or a collar button his eyes flash. \"Don't buy it here,\" he will say. \"They ask too much. I will show you a cheaper place.\" And before you have time to think about it he will whisk you away and deposi t you before anoth er show window where there are the same ties and shirts and collar buttons – maybe it's the very same store! but you don't know the difference. When Kepi hears that you want to buy something his soul becomes animated. He will ask you so many questions and drag y ou to so m any places th at you are bound to get thirst y and ask him to have a drink, whereupon you will discover to your amazement that you are again standing in a tabac – maybe the same tabac! – and Kepi is saying again in that small"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"unctuous voice: \"Will you please be so good as to buy me a little cheroo t?\" No matter what you propose doing, even if it's only to walk around the corner , Kepi will econo mize for you.

The other day he brought a book for me to read. It was about a famous suit between a holy man and the editor of an Indian paper. The editor , it seems had openl y accused the holy man of leading a scandalous life; he went furthe r, and accused the holy man of being diseased. Kepi says it must have been the great French pox, but Nanantate e avers that it was the Japanese clap. For Nanant atee everything has to be a little exaggera ted. At any rate, says Nanant atee cheeril y: \"You will please tell me what it says, Endre e. I can't read the book – it hurts my arm.\" Then, by way of encourag ing me – \"it is a fine book about the fucking, Endree. Kepi has brought it for you. He thinks about nothing but the girls. So many girls he fucks – just like Krishna. We don't believ e in that business, Endre e...\" A little later he takes me upstairs to the attic which is loaded down with tin cans and crap from India wrapped in burlap and firecrack er paper. \"Here is where I bring the girls,\" he says. And then rather wistful ly: \"I am not a very good fucker , Endree. I don't screw the girls any more. I hold them in my arms and I say the words. I like only to say the word s now.\" It isn't necessary to listen any further : I know that he is going to tell me about his ar m. I can see him lying there with tha t broken hinge dangling from the side of the bed. But to my surprise he adds: \"I am no good for the fucking, Endree. I never was a very good fucke r. My brother , he is good! Three times a day, every day! And Kepi, he is good – j ust lik e Krishna.\" His mind is fixed now on the \"fucking business.\" Downsta irs, in the little room where he kneels before the open cabinet, he expla ins to me how it was when he was rich and his wife and the childr en were here. On holidays he would take his wife to the House of All Nations and hire a roo m for the nigh t. Ever y room was appointed in a dif feren t style. His wife liked it there very much. \"A wonderful place for the fucking, Endree. I know all the roo ms...\" The walls of the little room in which we are sitting are crammed with photographs. Every branch of the family is represented, it is like a cross section of the Indian empire. For the most part the members of this genealog ical tree look like withered leaves: the women are frail and they have a startled, fright ened look in their eyes: the men have a keen, intelligent look, like educa ted chimpanzees. They are all there, about ninety of them, with their white bullocks, their dung cakes, their skinn y legs, their old - fashioned spectacles; in the background, now and then, one catches a glimpse of the parch ed soil, of a crumbling pediment, of an idol with crooked arms, a sort of human centip ede. There is something so fantast ic, so incongruous about this gallery that one is reminded inevitably of the great spawn of temples which stretch from the Himalayas to the tip of Ceylon, a vast jumble of architecture, stagger ing in beaut y and at the same time monstrous, hideousl y monstrous because the fecundit y which seethes and ferments in the myriad ramifications of design seems to have exhausted the very soil of India itself. Looking at the seething hive of figures which swarm the façad es of the temples one is overwhel med by the potency of those dark, handsom e peopl es who mingled their mysterious streams in a sexual embrace that has lasted thirty centur ies or more. These"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"frail men and women with piercing eyes who stare out of the photographs seem like the emaciated shadow s of those virile, massive figures who incarnated themselves in stone and fresco from one end of India to the other in order that the heroi c myths of the races who here intermingled should remain forever entwined in the hearts of their countr ymen. When I look at only a fragm ent of these spacious dream s of stone, these toppling, sluggish edific es studded with gems, coagula ted with human sperm, I am overwhel med by the dazzling splendor of those imaginative flights which enabled half a billion people of diverse origins to thus incarna te the most fugitive expressions of their longing. It is a strange, inexpl icable medley of feelings which assails me now as Nanantat ee prattles on about the sister who died in childb irth. There she is on the wall, a frail, timid thing of twelve or thirteen clinging to the arm of a dotard. At ten years of age she was given in wedlock to this old roué who had already buried five wives. She had seven children, only one of whom survived her. She was given to the aged gorilla in order to keep the pearls in the family. As she was passing away, so Nanantat ee puts it, she whispered to the doctor : \"I am tired of this fucking... I don't want to fuck any more, doctor .\" As he relates this to me he scratches his head solemnly with his withered arm. \"The fucking busines s is bad, Endree,\" he says. \"But I will give you a word that will always make you lucky; you must say it every day, over and over, a million times you must say it. It is the best word there is, Endre e ... say it now ... OOMAHAR UMO OMA!\" \"OOM ARABO O...\" \"No, Endr ee ... lik e this ... O OMAHAR UMO OMA!\" \"OOM AMAB OOMB A...\" \"No, Endr ee ... lik e this....\" ...But what with the murky light, the botch y print, the tattered cover , the jigjagged page, the fumbling fingers, the fox - trotting fleas, the lie - a - bed lice, the scum on his tongue, the drop in his eye, the lump in his throa t, the drink in his pottle, the itch in his palm, the wail of his wind, the grief from his breath, the fog of his brainf ag, the tic of his conscienc e, the height of his rage, the gush of his funda ment, the fire in his gorge, the tickle of his tail, the rats in his garre t, the hullaba loo and the dust in his ears, since it took him a month to steal a march, he was hard - set to memorize more than a word a week. I suppose I would never have gotten out of Nanantate e's clutches if fate hadn't interven ed. One night, as luck would have it, Kepi asked me if I wouldn't take one of his clients to a whorehouse nearb y. The young man had just come from India and he had not very much money to spend. He was one of Gandhi's men, one of that little band who made the histori c march to the sea during the salt trouble. A very gay disciple of Gandhi' s I must say, despite the vows of abstinence he had taken. Evidently he hadn't looked at a woman for ages. It was all I could do to get him as far as the Rue Laferrièr e; he was like a dog with his tongue hanging out. And a pompous, vain little devil to boot! He had decked himself out in a corduro y suit, a beret, a cane, a Windsor tie; he had bought himself two fountain pens, a kodak, and some fancy underwea r. The money he was spending was a gift from the merchants of Bomb ay; they were sending him to England to spread the gospel of Gandhi."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Once inside Miss Hamilton's joint he began to lose his sang-fr oid . When suddenl y he found himself surrounded by a bevy of naked women he looked at me in consterna tion. \"Pick one out,\" I said. \"You can have your choic e.\" He had become so rattled that he could scarcel y look at them. \"You do it for me,\" he murmured, blushing violently. I looked them over cooll y and picked out a plump young wench who seem ed full of feathers. We sat down in the recep tion room and waited for the drinks. The madam wanted to know why I didn't take a girl also. \"Yes, you take one too,\" said the young Hindu. \"I don't want to be alone with her.\" So the girls were brought in again and I chose one for myself, a rather tall, thin one with melancho ly eyes. We were left alone, the four of us, in the recep tion room. After a few moments my young Gandhi leans over and whispers something in my ear. \"Sure, if you like her better, take her,\" I said, and so, rather awkwardl y and considerab ly embarr assed, I explain ed to the girls that we would like to switch. I saw at once that we had made a faux pas , but by now my young friend had becom e gay and lecherous and nothing would do but to get upstairs quick ly and have it over with. We took adjoining rooms with a connect ing door betwe en. I think my compan ion had in mind to make another switch once he had satisfied his sharp, gnawing hunger . At any rate, no sooner had the girls left the room to prepare themselv es than I hear him knocking on the door. \"Wher e is the toilet, please?\" he asks. Not thinking that it was anything serious I urge him to do in the bide t. The girls return with towels in their hands. I hear hi m giggling in the next roo m. As I'm putting on my pants suddenl y I hear a commotion in the next room . The girl is bawling him out, calling him a pig, a dirty little pig. I can't imagine what he has done to warrant such an outburst. I'm standing there with one foot in my trousers listening attentively. He's trying to explain to her in English, raising his voice louder and louder until it beco mes a shriek. I hear a door slam and in anoth er moment the madam bursts into my room, her face as red as a beet, her arms gesticulating wildl y. \"You ought to be ashamed of yourself,\" she screa ms, \"bringing a man like that to my place! He's a barbarian ... he's a pig ... he's a...!\" My companion is standing behind her, in the doorwa y, a look of utmost discom fiture on his fac e. \"What did y ou do?\" I ask. \"What did he do?\" yells the madam. \"I'll show you... Come here!\" And grabb ing me by the arm she drags me into the next room. \"There! There!\" she screa ms, point ing to the bide t. \"Com e on, le t's get out,\" says the Hindu bo y. \"Wait a minute, you can't get out as easil y as all that.\" The madam is standing by the bidet, fuming and spitting. The girls are standing there too, with towels in their hands. The five of us are stand ing there looking at the bidet. There are two enorm ous turds floating in the water. The madam bends down and puts a towel over it. \"Frightful! Frightful!\" she wails. \"Never have I seen anything like this! A pig! A dirty little pig!\" The Hindu boy looks at me reproa chfull y. \"You should have told me!\" he says. \"I didn't know it wouldn't go down. I asked you where to go and you told me to use that.\" He is al most in tears. Finall y the m adam takes m e to one side. She has beco me a little more reasonabl e now . After all, it was a mistake. Perhaps the gentlemen would like to come down stairs and"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"order another drink – for the girls. It was a great shock to the girls. They are not used to such things. And if the good gentlemen will be so land as to remember the femme de chamb re ... It is not so pretty for the femme de chambr e – that mess, that ugly mess. She shrugs her shoulders and winks her eye. A lamentable incident. But an accid ent. If the gentle men will wait here a few moments the maid wiill bring the drinks. Would the gentle men like to have som e cham pagne? Yes? \"I'd like to get out of here,\" sa ys the Hindu bo y weakl y. \"Don't feel so badly about it,\" says the madam. \"It is all over now. Mistakes will happen sometimes. Next time you will ask for the toilet.\" She goes on about the toilet – one on ever y floor , it seems. And a bathroo m too. \"I have lots of English clients,\" she says. \"They are all gentlemen. The gentleman is a Hindu ? Char ming people, the Hindus. So intel ligent. So handsom e.\" When we get into the street the charming young gentleman is almost weeping. He is sorry now that he bought a corduro y suit and the cane and the founta in pens. He talks about the eight vows that he took, the contro l of the palate, etc. On the march to Dandi even a plate of ice cream it was forbidden to take. He tells me about the spinning wheel – how the little band of Satyagrahists imitated the devot ion of their master. He relates with pride how he walked beside the master and conversed with him. I have the illusion of being in the presence of one of the twelve disciples. During the next few days we see a good deal of each other , there are interv iews to be arranged with the newspaper men and lectures to be given to the Hindu s of Paris. It is amazing to see how these spineless devils order one another about; amazing also to see how ineffectua l they are in all that concerns practical affairs. And the jealous y and the intrigu es, the petty, sordid rivalries. Wherever there are ten Hindu s togeth er there is India with her sects and schisms, her racial, lingua l, religious, political antagonis ms. In the person of Gandhi they are experienc ing for a brief moment the miracle of unity, but when he goes there will be a crash, an utter relapse into that strife and chaos so charac teristic of the Indian peop le. The young Hindu, of course, is optimistic. He has been to America and he has been conta minated by the cheap idealism of the Americans, conta minated by the ubiqui tous bathtub, the five-and-ten- cent store bric - a - brac, the bustle, the efficien cy, the machinery, the high wages, the free libraries, etc., etc. His ideal would be to American ize India. He is not at all pleased with Gandhi' s retrogressive mania. Forwar d, he says, just like a YMCA man. As I listen to his tales of Americ a I see how absurd it is to expect of Gandhi that miracle which will deroute the trend of destin y. India's enemy is not England, but America. India's enemy is the time spirit, the hand which cannot be turned back. Nothing will avail to offset this virus which is poisoning the whole world. America is the very incarna tion of doom. She will drag the whole world down to the botto mless pit. He thinks the Americ ans are a very gullib le peopl e. He tells me about the credulous souls who succored him there – the Quakers, the Unitarians, the Theosophists, the New Thoughters, the Seventh - day Advent ists, etc. He knew where to sail his boat, this brigh t young man. He knew how to make the tears come to his eyes at the right moment; he knew how to take up a collection, how to appeal to the minister's wife, how to make love to the mother and daughter at the same time. To look at him you would think him a saint. And he is a saint, in the modern fashion; a conta minated saint who talks in one breath of love, brotherhood, bathtubs, sanit ation, efficiency, etc."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"The last night of his sojourn in Paris is given up to \"the fuck ing business.\" He has had a full program all day – confer ences, cablegrams, intervi ews, photographs for the newspapers, affection ate farewells, advice to the faithful, etc., etc. At dinner time he decides to lay aside his troub les. He orders champagne with the meal, he snaps his fingers at the garçon and behaves in gener al like the boorish little peasan t that he is. And since he has had a bellyful of all the good places he suggests now that I show him something more primitive. He would like to go to a very cheap place, order two or three girls at once. I steer him along the Boulevard de la Chape lle warning him all the while to be careful of his pocketbook Around Aubervil liers we duck into a cheap dive and immediately we've got a flock of them on our hands. In a few minutes he's dancing with a naked wench, a huge blonde with creases in her jowls. I can see her ass reflec ted a dozen times in the mirrors that line the room – and those dark, bony fingers of his clutch ing her tenaciousl y. The table is full of beer glasses, the mechanic al piano is wheezing and gasping. The girls who are unoccup ied are sitting placidly on the leather benches, scratching themselves peacefu lly just like a family of chimpanzees. There is a sort of subdued pande monium in the air, a note of repressed violence, as if the awaited explosion requir ed the advent of some utterly minute detail, something microscopi c but thoroughl y unpre meditated, completely unexpe cted. In that sort of half - rever ie which perm its one to participate in an event and yet remain quite aloof, the little detail which was lacking began obscurel y but insistent ly to coagu late, to assume a freakish, crystalline form, like the frost which gathers on the windowpane. And like those frost patterns which seem so bizarr e, so utterly free and fantasti c in design, but which are neverthe less determined by the most rigid laws, so this sensat ion which commenced to take form inside me seemed also to be giving obedi ence to ineluctable laws. My whole being was responding to the dictates of an ambience which it had never before experien ced; that which I could call myself seemed to be contract ing, condensing, shrink ing from the stale, custom ary boundaries of the flesh whose perimeter knew only the m odulations of the nerve ends. And the more substant ial, the more solid the core of me became, the more delicate and extrav agant appeared the close, palpabl e reality out of which I was being squeez ed. In the measur e that I became more and more metallic, in the same measure the scene before my eyes became inflated. The state of tension was so finely drawn now that the introduc tion of a single foreign partic le, even a microscopic partic le, as I say, would have shattered everything. For the fraction of a second perhaps I experienc ed that utter clarity which the epileptic, it is said, is given to know . In that moment I lost completely the illusion of time and space: the world unfurled its drama simultaneousl y along a meridian which had no axis. In this sort of hair - trigger eterni ty I felt that everything was justifi ed, suprem ely justified; I felt the wars inside me that had left behind this pulp and wrack; I felt the crimes that were seeth ing here to emerge tomorrow in blatant screa mers; I felt the misery that was grind ing itself out with pestle and mortar, the long dull misery that dribb les away in dirty handkerch iefs. On the meridian of time there is no injustice: there is only the poetry of motion creating the illusion of truth and drama. If at any moment anywhere one comes face to face with the absolute, that great sympathy which makes men like Gauta ma and Jesus seem divin e freezes away; the monstrous thing is not that men have created roses out of this dung heap, but that, for some reason or other , they should want roses. For some reason or other man looks for the miracle, and to accomplish it he will wade through blood. He will debauch himself with ideas, he will reduce himself to a shadow if for only one second of his life he can"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"close his eyes to the hideousness of reality. Everything is endured – disgrace, humiliation, povert y, war, crime, ennui – in the belief that overnigh t something will occur , a miracle, which will render life tolerable. And all the while a meter is running inside and there is no hand that can reach in there and shut it off. All the while someon e is eating the bread of life and drinking the wine, some dirty fat cockroach of a priest who hides away in the cellar guzzling it, while up above in the light of the street a phanto m host touches the lips and the blood is pale as water. And out of the endless torment and misery no miracle comes forth, no microscopic vestige of relief. Only ideas, pale, attenuat ed ideas which have to be fattened by slaught er; ideas which come forth lik e bile, like the guts of a pig when the carcass is ripped open. And so I think what a miracle it would be if this miracle which man attends eternally should turn out to be nothing more than these two enormous turds which the faithful disciple dropped in the bide t. What if at the last moment, when the banque t table is set and the cymbals clash, there should appear suddenl y, and wholly without warning, a silver platter on which even the blind could see that there is nothing more, and nothing less, than two enorm ous lumps of shit. That, I believe would be more miraculous than anything which man has looked forward to. It would be miraculous because it would be undrea med of. It would be more miraculous than even the wildest dream because anybody could imagine the possibility but nobod y ever has, and probabl y nobod y ever again will. Somehow the realization that nothing was to be hoped for had a salutary effect upon me. For weeks and months, for years, in fact, all my life I had been looking forward to something happening, some intrinsi c event that would alter my life, and now suddenl y, inspired by the absolute hopelessness of everything, I felt reliev ed, felt as though a great burden had been lifted from my shoulders. At dawn I parted company with the young Hindu, after touching him for a few francs, enough for a room. Walking toward Montparnasse I decided to let myself drift with the tide, to make not the least resistance to fate, no matter in what form it presented itself. Nothing that had happened to me thus far had been sufficient to destro y me; nothing had been destro yed excep t my illusions. I myself was intact. The world was intact. Tomorrow there might be a revolut ion, a plague, an earthquak e; tomorrow there might not be left a single soul to whom one could turn for sympathy, for aid, for faith. It seem ed to me that the great calamity had alread y manifested itself, that I could be no more truly alone than at this very moment. I made up my mind that I would hold on to nothing, that I would expect nothing, that henceforth I would live as an animal, a beast of prey, a rover , a plunderer . Even if war were declared, and it were my lot to go, I would grab the bayonet and plunge it, plunge it up to the hilt. And if rape were the order of the day then rape I would, and with a vengeanc e. At this very moment, in the quiet dawn of a new day, was not the earth giddy with crime and distress ? Had one single element of man's nature been altered, vitally, funda mentally altered, by the incessant march of histor y? By what he calls the better part of his nature, man has been betrayed, that is all. At the extreme limits of his spiritual being man finds himself again naked as a savage. When he finds God, as it were, he has been picked clean: he is a skeleton. One must burrow into life again in order to put on flesh. The word must become flesh; the soul thirsts. On whatever crum b my eye fastens, I will pounce and devour . If to live is the paramount thing, then I will live, even if I must become a canniba l.

He had warned me that if he didn't answer it would mean that he was sleep ing with someone, probabl y his Georgia cunt. Anyway, there he was, tucked away comfortably, but with an air of wearin ess as usual. He wakes up cursing himself, or cursing the job, or cursing life. He wakes up utterly bored and discom fited, chagrin ed to th ink tha t he did not die overnight. I sit down by the window and give him what encourage ment I can. It is tedious work. One has to actually coax him out of bed. Mornings – he means by mornings anywher e between one and five p.m. – mornings, as I say, he gives himself up to reveries. Mostly it is about the past he dreams. About his \"cunts.\" He endeavors to recall how they felt, what they said to him at certain critical moments, where he laid them, and so on. As he lies there, grinning and cursing, he manipul ates his fingers in that curious, bored way of his, as though to conve y the impression that his disgust is too great for word s. Over the bedstead hangs a douche bag which he keeps for emergencies – for the virgins whom he tracks down like a sleuth. Even aft er he has slept with one of th ese m ythical creatur es he will sti ll refer to her as a virgin, and a lmost never by name. \"My virgin,\" he will say, just as he says \"my Georgia cunt.\" When he goes to the toilet he says: \"If my Georgia cunt calls tell her to wait. Say I said so. And listen, you can have her if you like. I'm tired of her.\" He takes a squint at the weather and heaves a deep sigh. If it's rainy he says: \"God damn this fucking climate, it makes one morbid.\" And if the sun is shining brigh tly he says: \"God damn that fucking sun, it makes you blind!\" As he starts to shave he sudden ly remembers that there is no clean towel. \"God damn this fucking hotel, they're too stingy to give you a clean towel every day!\" No matter what he does or where he goes things are out of joint. Either it's the fucking countr y or the fucking job, or else it's some fucking cunt who' s put him on the blink. \"My teeth are all rotten,\" he says, gargling his throat. \"It's the fucking bread they give you to eat here.\" He opens his mouth wide and pulls his lower lip down. \"See that? Pulled out six teeth yesterday. Soon I'll have to get anoth er plate. That's what you get working for a living. When I was on the bum I had all my teeth, my eyes were bright and clear. Look at me now! It's a wonder I can make a cunt any more. Jesus, what I'd like is to find some rich cunt – like that cute little prick, Carl. Did he ever show you the letters she sends him? Who is she, do you know? He wouldn't tell me her name, the bastard... he's afraid I might take her away from him.\" He gargles his throat again and then takes a long look at the cavities. \"You're lucky,\" he says ruefull y. \"You've got friends, at least. I haven't anybody, except that cute little prick who drives me bats abou t his rich cunt.\" \"Listen,\" he says, \"do you happen to know a cunt by the name of Norm a?

It's been drizzling this way for the last five da ys. \"Are we going to the Dôme, Joe?\" I call him Joe be cause he calls me Joe. When Carl is with us he is Joe too. Everybody is Joe because it's easier that way. It's also a pleasant reminder not to take yourself too seriousl y. Anyway, Joe doesn't want to go the Dôme – he owes too much money there. He wants to go to the Coupole. Wants to take a little walk first around the block. \"But it's rain ing, Joe.\" \"I know , but what the hell! I've got to have my consititu tional. I've got to wash the dirt out of my belly.\" When he says this I have the impression that the whole world is wrapped up there inside his bel ly, and that it's rotting there. As he's putting on his things he falls back again into a semi - comatose state. He stands there with one arm in his coat sleev e and his hat on assways and he begins to dream aloud – about the Riviera, about the sun, about lazing one's life away. \"All I ask of life,\" he says, \"is a bunch of books, a bunch of dreams, and a bunch of cunt.\" As he mumbles this meditatively he looks at me with the softest, the most insidious smile. \"Do you like that smile?\" he says. And then disgustedl y – \"Jesus, if I could only find some rich cunt to smile at that way!\" \"Only a rich cunt can save me now,\" he says with an air of utmost weariness. \"One gets tired of chasing after new cunts all the time. It gets mechanical. The troub le is, you see, I can't fall in love. I'm too much of an egoist. Women only help me to dream, that's all. It's a vice, like drink or opium. I've got to have a new one every day; if I don't I get morbid. I think too much. Sometimes I'm amazed at myself, how quick I pull it off – and how little it really means. I do it automatically like. Sometimes I'm not think ing about a woman at all, but suddenl y I notice a woman looking at me and then, bango! it starts all over again. Before I know what I'm doing I've got her up to the room.

They put up a fight at least.\" Just the same, as we glance over the terrasse there is hardl y a whore in sight whom he hasn't fucked at some time or other. Stand ing at the bar he points them out to me, one by one, goes over them anato mically, describes their good points and their bad. \"They're all frigid,\" he says.

He's lost all his sluggishness now. His eyes are popping out of his head. And of course one thing reminds him of another . He wants to get out of the fucking hotel because the noise bothers him. He wants to write a book too so as to have something to occup y his mind. But then the godda mned job stands in the way. \"It takes it out of you, that fucking job! I don't want to write about Montparnasse... I want to write my.life, my thoughts. I want to get the dirt out of my belly... Listen, get that one over there! I had her a long time ago. She used to be down near Les Halles. A funny bitch. She lay on the edge of the bed and pulled her dress up. Ever try it that way? Not bad. She didn't hurry me either. She just lay back and played with her hat while I slugged away at her. And when I come she says sort of bored like – 'Are you through?' Like it didn't make any difference at all. Of course, it doesn 't make any difference, I know that godda mn well... but the cold - blooded way she had... I sort of liked it... it was fascinat ing, you know ? When she goes to wipe herself she begins to sing. Going out of the hotel she was still singing. Didn't even say Au revoir! Walks off swinging her hat and humming to herself like. That's a whore for you! A good lay though. I think I liked her better than my virgin. There's something deprav ed about screwing a woman who doesn't give a fuck about it. It heats your blood...\" And then, after a moment's meditation – \"Can you imagine what she'd be like if she had any feelings?\" \"Listen,\" he says, \"I want you to come to the Club with me tomorrow afternoon... there's a dance on.\" \"I can't to morrow , Joe. I prom ised to help Carl out...\" \"Listen, forget that prick! I want you to do me a favor . It's like this\" – he commences to mold his hands again. \"I've got a cunt lined up... she promised to stay with me on my night off. But I'm not positive about her yet. She's got a mother, you see... some shit of a painter , she chews my ear off every time I see her. I think the truth is, the mother's jealous. I don't think she'd mind so much if I gave her a lay first. You know how it is... Anyway, I thought m aybe you wouldn't m ind taking the m other... she' s not so bad... if I hadn't seen the daughter I might have considered her myself. The daughter's nice and young, fresh like, you know what I me an? There's a clean smell to her...\" \"Listen, Joe, you'd bet ter find somebody else...\" \"Aw, don't take it like that! I know how you feel about it. It's only a little favor I'm asking y ou to do for m e. I don't know ho w to get rid of the old hen. I thought first I'd get drunk and ditch her – but I don't think the young one'd like that. They're sentimental like. They come from Minnesota or somewher e. Anyway, come around tomorrow and wake me up, will you? Otherwise I'll oversleep. And besides, I want you to help me find"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"a room. You know I'm helpless. Find me a room in a quiet street, somewhere near here. I've got to stay around here... I've got credit here. Listen, prom ise me you'll do that for me. I'll buy you a meal now and then. Come around anyway, because I go nuts talking to these foolish cunts. I want to talk to you about Havelock Ellis. Jesus, I've had the book out for three weeks now and I haven't looked at it. You sort of rot here. Would you believ e it, I've never been to the Louvre – nor the Comédie - França ise. Is it worth going to those joints ? Still, it sort of takes your mind off things, I suppose. What do you do with yourself all day? Don't you get bored? What do you do for a lay? Listen... come here! Don't run away yet... I'm lonel y. Do you know something – if this keeps up another year I'll go nuts. I've got to get out of this fucking countr y. There's nothing for me here. I know it's lousy now, in Americ a, but just the same... You go queer over here... all these cheap shits sitting on their ass all day bragging about their work and none of them is worth a stinking damn. They're all failures – that's why they come over here. Listen, Joe, don't you ever get homesick? You're a funny guy... you seem to like it over here. What do you see in it?... I wish you'd tell me. I wish to Christ I could stop thinking about myself. I'm all twisted up inside... it's like a knot in there... Listen, I know I'm boring the shit out of you, but I've got to talk to someone. I can't talk to those guys upstairs... you know what those bastards are like... they all take a byline. And Carl, the little prick, he's so goddam ned selfish. I'm an egotist, but I'm not selfish. There's a differen ce. I'm a neurotic, I guess. I can't stop thinking about myself. It isn't that I think myself so impor tant... I simply can't think about anything else, that's all. If I could fall in love with a woman that might help some. But I can't find a woman who interests me. I'm in a mess, you can see that can't you? What do you advise me to do? What would you do in my place? Listen, I don't want to hold you back any longer , but wake me up tomorrow – at one - thirty – will you? I'll give you something extra if you'll shine my shoes. And listen, if you've got an extra shirt, a clean one, bring it along, will you? Shit, I'm grinding my balls off on that job, and it doesn't even give me a clean shirt. They've got us over here lik e a bunch of niggers. Ah, well, shit! I'm going to t ake a walk... wash the dirt out of m y belly. Don't for get, tomo rrow! \" For six months or more it's been going on, this correspondence with the rich cunt, Irene. Recently I've been report ing to Carl every day in order to bring the affair to a head, because as far as Irene is concerned this thing could go on indef initely. In the last few days there's been a perfec t avalanch e of letters exchanged ; the last letter we dispatched was almost forty pages long, and written in three languages. It was a potpourri, the last letter - tag ends of old novels, slices from the Sunda y supplement, reconstruct ed versions of old letters to Llona and Tania, garbled transl iterations of Rabela is and Petronius – in short, we exhausted ourselves. Finall y Irene decid es to come out of her shell. Finall y a letter arrives giving a rendezvous at her hotel. Carl is pissing in his pants. It's one thing to write letters to a woman you don't know; it's another thing entirely to call on her and make love to her. At the last moment he's quaking so that I almost fear I'll have to substitu te for him. When we get out of the taxi in front of her hotel he's trembling so much that I have to walk him around the block first. He's already had two Pernods, but they haven't made the slightest impression on him. The sight of the hotel itself is enough to crush him: it's a pret entious place with one of those huge empty lobbi es in which Englishwo men sit for hours with a blank look. In order to make sure that he wouldn't run away I stood by while the porter telephon ed to announce him. Irene was there, and she was waiting for him. As he got into the lift he"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"threw me a last despair ing glance, one of those mute appeals which a dog makes when you put a noose around its neck. Going through the revolv ing door I thought of Van Norden... I go back to the hotel and wait for a telephone call. He's only got an hour' s time and he's prom ised to let me know the results before going to work. I look over the carbons of the letters we sent her. I try to imagine the situation as it actually is, but it's beyond me. Her letters are much better than ours – they're sincer e, that's plain. By now they've sized ea ch other up. I w onder if he' s still pissing in his pants. The telephon e rings. His voice sounds queer , squeak y, as though he were fright ened and jubilant at the same time. He asks me to substitute for him at the office. \"Tell the bastard an ything! Tell him I'm dying...\" \"Listen, Carl... can you tell me...?\" \"Hello! Are you Henr y Miller?\" It's a woman's voice. It's Irene. She's saying hello to me. Her voice sound s beautiful over the phone... beaut iful. For a moment I'm in a perfect panic. I don't know what to say to her. I'd like to say: \"Listen, Irene, I think you are beautifu l... I think you're wonderful .\" I'd like to say one true thing to her, no matter how silly it would sound, because now that I hear her voice everything is chang ed. But before I can gather my wits Carl is on the phone again and he's saying in that queer squeak y voice : \"She lik es you, Joe. I told her all abou t you...\" At the of fice I have to hold cop y for Van Norden. When it comes time for th e break he pulls m e aside. He looks glu m and ravaged. \"So he 's dying, is he, the li ttle prick? Listen, what' s the lowdown on this ?\" \"I think he went to see his ri ch cunt,\" I ans wer ca lmly. \" What! You mean he called on her?\" He seem s beside himself. \"Listen, where does she live? What's her na me?\" I pretend ignorance. \"Listen,\" he sa ys, \"you're a decent guy. Why the hell don't y ou let me in on this racket?\" In order to appease him I prom ise finally that I'll tell him everything as soon as I get the det ails from Carl. I can hardl y wait myself until I see Carl. Around noon next day I knock at his door. He's up already and lather ing his beard. Can't tell a thing from the expression on his face. Can't even tell whether he's going to tell me the truth. The sun is streaming in through the open windo w, the birds are chirping, and yet somehow , why it is I don't know , the room seems more barren and povert y-strick en than ever. The floor is slathered with lather, and on the rack there are the two dirty towels which are never changed. And somehow Carl isn't changed either, and that puzzl es me more than anything. This morning the whole world ought to be changed, for bad or good, but changed, radically changed. And y et Carl is standing there lather ing his fac e and not a single de tail is alt ered. \"Sit down... sit down there on the bed,\" he says. \"You're going to hear everything... but wait first... wait a little.\" He commences to lather his face again, and then to hone his razor . He even re marks about the water... no hot water again. \"Listen, Carl, I'm on tenterhooks. You can torture me afterward, if you like, but tell me now, tell me one thing... was it good or bad?\" He turns away from the mirror with brush in hand and gives me a strange smile. \"Wait! I'm going to tel l you everything...\""},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"\"That means it was a failure.\" \"No,\" he says, drawing out his word s. \"It wasn't a failure, and it wasn't a success either... By the way, did y ou fix it up for m e at the office? What did y ou tell them?\" I see it's no use trying to pull it out of him. When he gets good and ready he'll tell me. Not before. I li e back on the bed, silent as a clam. He goes on s having. Suddenl y, apropos of nothing at all, he begins to talk – disconnected ly at first, and then more and more clearly, emphatically, resolut ely. It's a struggl e to get it out, but he seems determined to relate everything; he acts as if he were getting something off his conscienc e. He even reminds me of the look he gave me as he was going up the elevator shaft. He dwells on that lingering ly, as though to imply that everything were contained in that last moment, as though, if he had the power to alter things, he would never have put foot outsid e the eleva tor. She wa s in her dressing sack when he ca lled. There was a bucket of cha mpagn e on the dresser. The room was rather dark and her voice was lovely. He gives me all the details about the room , the champagn e, how the garçon opened it, the noise it made, the way her dressing sack rustled when she came forward to greet him – he tells me everything but what I want to hear . It was about eight when he called on her. At eight - thirty he was nervous, think ing about the job. \"It was about nine when I ca lled you, wasn't it?\" he sa ys. \"Yes, about that.\" \"I wa s nervous, see...\" \"I kno w that. Go on...\" I don't know whether to believe him or not, especia lly after those letters we concoct ed. I don't even know whether I've heard him accurate ly, because what he's telling me sound s utterly fantastic. And yet it sounds true too, knowing the sort of guy he is. And then I remember his voice over the telephon e, that strange mixture of fright and jubilation. But why isn't he more jubilant now? He keeps smiling all the time, smiling like a rosy little bedbug that has had its fill. \"It was nine o'clock,\" he says once again, \"when I called you up, wasn 't it?\" I nod m y head weari ly. Yes, it was nine o'clock. He is certain now that it was nine o'clock because he remembers having taken out his watch. Anyway, when he looked at his watch again it was ten o'clock. At ten o'clock she was lying on the divan with her boobies in her hands. That's the way he gives it to me – in driblets. At eleven o'clock it was all settled; they were going to run away, to Borneo. Fuck the husband! She never loved him anyway. She would never have written the first letter if the husband wasn 't old and passionless. \"And then she says to me: 'But listen, dear, how do y ou know y ou won't ge t tired of m e?' \" At this I burst out l aughing. This sounds preposterous to m e, I can't help it. \"What did y ou expect me to sa y? I said: 'How could an yone ever grow tired of you? ' \" And then he describ es to me what happened after that, how he bent down and kissed her breasts, and how, after he had kissed them fervidly, he stuffed them back into her corsage, or whatever it is they call these things. And after that another coupe of champagn e. Around midnight the garçon arrives with beer and sandwiches – caviar sandwiches. And all the while, so he says, he has been dying to take a leak. He had one hard on, but it faded out. All the while his bladder is fit to burst, but he imagines, the cute little prick"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"that he is, that the situ ation calls for delica cy. At one - thirty she's for hiring a carriage and driving through the Bois. He has only one thought in his headhow to take a leak? \"I love you... I adore you,\" he says. \"I'll go anywher e you say – Istanbul, Singapore, Honolulu. Only I must go now... It's getting late.\" He tells me all this in his dirty little room, with the sun pouring in and the birds chirping away like mad. I don't yet know whether she was beaut iful or not. He doesn 't know himself, the imbecile. He rather thinks she wasn 't. The room was dark and then there was the champagn e and his nerves all fraz zled. \"But y ou ought to know something about her – if this isn't all a godda mned lie!\" \"Wait a minute,\" he says. \"Wait... let me think! No, she wasn't beautiful. I'm sure of that now. She had a streak of gray hair over her forehead... I remember that. But that wouldn't be so bad – I had almost forgotten it you see. No, it was her arms – they were thin... they were thin and brittle.\" He begins to pace back and forth. – Suddenl y he stops dead. \"If she were only ten years younger!\" he excla ims. \"If she were ten years younger I might overlook the streak of gray hair... and even the brittle arms. Buc she's too old. You see, with a cunt like that every year counts now. She won't be just one year older next year – she'll be ten years older. Another year hence and she'll be twent y years older. And I'll be ge tting younger looking all the ti me – at least for another five y ears...\" \"But how did it end?\" I int errupt. \"That's just it... it didn't end. I prom ised to see her Tuesda y around five o'clock. That's bad, you know! There were lines in her face which will look much worse in daylight. I suppo se she wants me to fuck her Tuesda y. Fucking in the daytime – you don't do it with a cunt like that. Espec ially in a hotel like that. I'd rather do it on my night off... but Tuesda y's not my night off. And that's not all. I promised her a letter in the meantime. How am I going to write her a letter now? I haven't anything to say... Shit! If only she were ten years younger. Do you think I should go with her... to Borneo or wherever it is she wants to take me? What would I do with a rich cunt like that on my hands ? I don't know how to shoot. I am afraid of guns and all that sort of thing. Besides, she'll be wanting me to fuck her night and day... noth ing but hunt ing and fucking all the time... I can't do it!\" \"Maybe it won't be so bad as y ou think. She'll bu y you ties and al l sorts of things...\" \"Maybe you'll come along with us, eh ? I told her all about you...\" \"Did you tell her I was poor ? Did y ou tell her I needed things?\" \"I told her everything. Shit, everything would be fine, if she were just a few years younger. She said she was turning forty. That means fifty or sixty. It's like fucking your own m other... y ou can't do it... it's im possible.\" \"But she must have had some attractiveness... you were kissing her breasts, you said.\" \"Kissing her breasts – what' s that? Be sides it was dark, I'm telling you.\" Putting on his pants a button falls off. \"Look at that will you. It's falling apart, the goddam ned suit. I've worn it for seven years now... I never paid for it either. It was a good suit once, but it stinks now. And that cunt would buy me suits too, all I wanted most likely. But that's what I don't like, having a woman shell out for me. I never did that in my life. That's your idea. I'd rather live alone. Shit, this is a good room isn't it?"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"What's wrong with it? It's a damned sight better than her room, isn't it? I don't like her fine hotel. I'm against hotels like that. I told her so. She said she didn't care where she lived... said she'd co me and live with m e if I wanted her to. Can you picture her moving in here with her big trunks and her hatboxes and all that crap she drags around with her? She has too many things – too many dresses and bottles and all that. It's like a clinic, her room . If she gets a little scratch on her finger it's serious. And then she has to be massaged and her hair has to be waved and she musn't eat this and she musn't eat that. Listen, Joe, she'd be all right if she were just a little younger. You can forgive a young cunt anything. A young cunt doesn't have to have any brains. They're better without brains. But an old cunt, even if she's brilliant, even if she's the most charm ing woman in the world, noth ing makes any difference. A young cunt is an invest ment; an old cunt is a dead loss. All they can do for you is buy you things. But that doesn't put meat on their arms or juice betwe en the legs. She isn't bad, Irene. In fact, I think you'd like her. With you its differen t. You don't have to fuck her. You can afford to like her. Maybe you wouldn't like all those dresses and the bottles and what not, but you could be tolerant. She wouldn't bore you, that I can tell you. She's even interesting, I might say. But she's withered. Her breasts are all right yet – but her arms! I told her I'd bring you around some day. I talked a lot about you... I didn't know what to say to her. Maybe you'd like her, especi ally when s he's dressed. I don't know...\" \"Listen, she's rich, you say? I'll like her! I don't care how old she is, so long as she's not a hag...\" \"She's not a hag! What are you talking about? She's charming, I tell you. She talks well. She looks well too... onl y her arm s...\" \"All right, if that's how it is, I'll fuck her – if you don't want to. Tell her that. Be subtle about it, though. With a woman like that you've got to do things slowl y. You bring me around and let things work out for themselves. Praise the shit out of me. Act jealous like... Shit, maybe we'll fuck her together... and we'll go pla ces and we'll eat together... and we'll drive and hunt and wear nice things. If she wants to go to Borneo let her take us along. I don't know how to shoot either, but that doesn't matter. She doesn't care about that either. She just wants to be fucked that's all. You're talking about her arms all the time. You don't have to look at her arms all the time, do you? Look at this bedspread! Look at the mirror! Do you call this living? Do you want to go on being delicate and live like a louse all your life? You can't even pay your hotel bill... and you've got a job too. This is no way to live. I don't care if she's sevent y years old – it's better than this...\" \"Listen, Joe, you fuck her for me... then everything'll be fine. Maybe I'll fuck her once in a while too... on my night off. It's four days now since I've had a good shit.

I told her what a good guy you are... You'll do things for me, eh? You're not too delicate, eh? If we go to Borneo I won't have hemorrhoids any more. Maybe I'll develop something else... something worse... fever perhaps... or cholera. Shit, it's better to die of a good disease like that than to piss your life away on a newspaper with grapes up your ass and buttons falling off your pants. I'd like to be rich, even if it were only for a week, and then go to a hospit al with a good disease, a fatal one, and have flowers in the room and nurses dancing around and telegrams coming. They take good"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"care of you if you're rich. They wash you with cotton batting and they comb your hair for you. Shit, I know all that. Maybe I'd be lucky and not die at all. Maybe I'd be crippled all my life... m aybe I'd be paral yzed and have to sit in a wheelch air. Bu then I'd be taken care of just the same... even if I had no more money. If you're an invalid – a real one – they don't let you starve. And you get a clean bed to lie in... and they change the towels every day. This way nobod y gives a fuck about you, especia lly if you have a job. They think a man should be happy if he's got a job. What would you rather do – be a crippl e all your life, or have a job... or marry a rich cunt? You'd rather marry a rich cunt, I can see that. You only think about food. But suppo sing you married her and then you couldn't get a hard on any more – that happens sometimes – what would you do then? You'd be at her mercy. You'd have to eat out of her hand, like a little poodle dog. You'd like that, would you? Or maybe you don't think of those things ? I think of everyth ing . I think of the suits I'd pick out and the places I'd like to go to, but I also think of the other thing. That's the import ant thing. What good are the fancy ties and the fine suits if you can't get a hard on any more? You couldn't even betray her – because she'd be on your heels all the time. No, the best thing would be to marry her and then get a disease right away. Only not syphilis. Cholera, let's say, or yellow fever. So that if a miracle did happen and your life was spared you'd be a cripple for the rest of your days. Then you wouldn't have to worry about fucking her any more, and you wouldn't have to worry about the rent either. She'd probabl y buy you a fine wheelch air with rubber tires and all sorts of levers and what not. You might even be able to use your hands – I mean enough to be able to write. Or you could have a secret ary, for that matter. That's it – that's the best solution for a write r. What does a guy want with his arms and legs? He doesn 't need arms and legs to write with. He needs securit y... peace... prote ction. All those heroes who parade in wheelch airs – it's too bad they're not writers. If you could only be sure, when you go to war, that you'd have only your legs blown off... if you could be sure of that I'd say let's have a war tomorrow . I wouldn't give a fuck about the medals – they could keep the medals. All I'd want is a good wheelchair and thre e meals a da y. Then I'd give the m something to read, those pricks.\" The following day, at one - thirty, I call on Van Norden. It's his day off, or rather his night of f. He has lef t word with Carl that I am to he lp him move toda y. I find him in a state of unusual depression. He hasn't slept a wink all night, he tells me. There's something on his mind, something that's eating him up. It isn't long before I discover what it is; he's been waiting impatiently for m e to arrive in order to spill it. \"That guy,\" he begins, meaning Carl, \"that guy's an artist. He described every detail minutely. He told it to me with such accura cy that I know it's all a godda mned lie... but I can't dis miss it from my mind. You kno w how m y mind work s!\" He interrupts himself to inquire if Carl has told me the whole story. There isn't the least suspicion in his mind that Carl may have told me one thing and him another . He seems to think that the story was invent ed expressl y to torture him. He doesn't seem to mind so much that it's a fabrica tion. It's the \"images\" as he says, which Carl left in his mind, that get him. The images are real, even if the whole story is false. And besides, the fact that there actually is a rich cunt on the scene and that Carl actually paid her a visit, that's undeniabl e. What actua lly happened is secondar y; he takes it for grant ed that Carl put the boots to her. But what drives him desperate is the thought that what Carl has described to him might have been possible."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"\"It's just like that guy,\" he says, \"to tell me he put it to her six or seven times. I know that's a lot of shit and I don't mind that so much, but when he tells me that she hired a carriag e and drove him out to the Bois and that they used the husband's fur coat for a blanket, that's too much. I suppo se he told you about the chauf feur waiting respectful ly... and listen, did he tell you how the engine purred all the time? Jesus, he built that up w onderful ly. It's ju st like hi m to th ink of a det ail like that... it's one of those little details which makes a thing psycholog ically real... you can't get it out of your head afterward. And he tells it to me so smooth ly, so natura lly... I wonder , did he think it up in advan ce or did it just pop out of his head like that, spontaneousl y? He's such a cute little liar you can't walk away from him... it's like he's writing you a letter, one of those flowerpots that he makes overnight. I don't understand how a guy can write such letters... I don't get the mentality behind it... it's a form of masturba tion... what do you think?\" But before I have an opportunit y to ventur e an opinion, or even to laugh in his face, Van Norden goes on with his mono logue. \"Listen, I suppose he told you everything... did he tell you how he stood on the balcon y in the moonlight and kissed her? That sound banal when you repeat it, but the way that guy describes it... I can just see the little prick standing there with the woman in his arms and alread y he's writing another letter to her, another flowerpot about the roof tops and all that crap he steals from his French authors. That guy never says a thing that's original, I found that out. You have to get a clue like... find out whom he's been reading lately... and it's hard to do that because he's so damned secretive. Listen, if I didn't know that you went there with him, I wouldn't believ e that the woman existed. A guy like that could write letters to himself. And yet he's lucky... he's so damned tiny, so frail, so romantic looking, that women fall for him now and then... they sort of adopt him... they feel sorry for him, I guess. And some cunts like to receive flowerpots... it makes them feel importan t... But this woman's an intelligent woman, so he says. You ought to know... you've seen her letters. What do you suppose a woman like that saw in him? I can understand her fal ling for the letters... but how do you suppose she felt when she saw him? \"But listen, all that's beside the point. What I'm getting at is the way he tells it to me. You know how he embroid ers things... well, after that scene on the balcon y – he gives me that like an hors d'œuvre, you know – after that, so he says, they went inside and he unbuttoned her pajam as. What are y ou smiling for? Was he shitting me about tha t?\" \"No, no! You're giving it to m e exact ly as he to ld me. Go ahe ad...\" \"After that\" – here Van Norden has to smile himself, – \"after that, mind you, he tells me how she sat in the chair with her legs up... not a stitch on... and he's sitting on the floor looking up at her, telling her how beautiful she looks... did he tell you that she looked like a Matisse?... Wait a minute... I'd like to remember exactly what he said. He had some cute little phrase there about an odalisque... what the hell's an odalisque anyway? He said it in French, that's wh y it's hard to remember the fucking thing... but it sounded good. It sounded just like the sort of thing he might say. And she probabl y thought it was original with him... I suppo se she thinks he's a poet or something. But listen, all this is nothing... I make allowan ces for his imagina tion. It's what happened after that that drives me crazy. All night long I've been tossing about, playing with these images he left in my mind. I can't get it out of my head. It sounds so real to me that if it didn't happen I could strangl e the bastard. A guy has no right to invent things like that."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Or else he's diseased... \"What I'm getting at is that moment when, he says, he got down on his knees and with those two skinn y fingers of his he spread her cunt open. You remember that? He says she was sitting there with her legs dangling over the arms of the chair and suddenl y, he says, he got an inspira tion. This was after he had given her a couple of lays alread y... after he had made that little spiel about Matisse. He gets down on his knees – get this! – and with his two fingers... just the tips of them, mind you... he opens the little petals... squish - squish ... just like that. A sticky little sound... almost inaud ible. Squish - squish! Jesus, I've been hear ing it all night long! And then he sa ys – as if that weren't enough for me – then he tells me he buried his head in her muff. And when he did that, so help me Christ, if she didn't swing her legs around his neck and lock him there. That finished me! Imagine it! Imagine a fine, sensitive woman like that swinging her legs around his neck! There's something poisonous about it. It's so fantastic that it sounds convinc ing. If he had only told me about the champagne and the ride in the Bois and even that scene on the balcony I could have dismissed it. But this thing is so incredible that it doesn't sound like a lie any more. I can't believe that he ever read anything like that anywhere, and I can't see what could have put the idea into his head unless there was some truth in it. With a little prick like that, you know , anything can happen. He may not have fucked her at all, but she may have let him diddle her... you never know with these rich cunts what they might expect you to do...\" When he finally pulls himself out of bed and starts to shave the afternoon is alread y well advan ced. I've finally succeeded in switching his mind to other things, to the moving princip ally. The maid comes in to see if he's ready – he's supposed to have vacat ed the room by noon. He's just in the act of slipping into his trousers. I'm a little surprised that he doesn't excuse himself, or turn away. Seeing him standing there nonchalan tly buttoning his fly as he gives her order s I begin to titter. \"Don't mind her,\" he says, throwing her a look of supreme contempt, \" she's just a big sow. Give her a pinch in the ass, if you like. She won't say anything.\" And then addressing her, in English, he says, \"Com e here, you bitch, put your hand on this!\" At this I can't restra in myself any longer . I burst out laughing, a fit of hysterical laugh ter which infects the maid also, though she doesn't know what it's all about. The maid commences to take down the pictur es and the photographs, mostly of himself, which line the walls. \" You ,\" he says, jerking his thum b, \"com e here! Here's som ething to remember me by\" – ripp ing a photograph off the wall – \"when I go you can wipe your ass with it. See,\" he says, turning to me, \"she's a dumb bitch. She wouldn't look any more intelligent if I said it in French.\" The maid stands there with her mouth open; she is evident ly convin ced that he is cracked. \"Hey!\" he yells at her as if she were hard of hearing. \"Hey, you! Yes, you! Like this...!\" and he takes the photograph, his own photograph, and wipes his ass with it. \" Comme ça! Savv y? You've got to draw pictures for her,\" he says, thrusting his lower lip forward in absolute disgu st. He watches her helplessly as she throws his things into the big valises. \"Here, put these in too,\" he says, handing her a toothbrush and the douche bag. Half of his belongings are lying on the floor. The valises are crammed full and there is nowhere to put the paintings and the books and the bottles that are half empty. \"Sit down a minute,\" he says. \"We've got plent y of time. We've got to think this thing out. If you hadn't come around I'd never have gotten out of here. You see how helpless I am. Don't let me forget to take the bulbs out... they belong to me. That wastebasket belongs to me too. They expect you to live like pigs, these bastards.\" The maid has gone down stairs to get some"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"twine... \"Wait till you see... she'll charge me for the twine even if it's only three sous. They wouldn't sew a button on your pants here without charging for it. The lousy, dirty scroungers!\" He takes a bottle of Calvados from the mantelpiece and nods to me to grab the other. \"No use carrying these to the new place. Let's finish them off now. But don't give her a drink! That bastard, I wouldn't leave her a piece of toi let pape r. I'd like to ruin the joint before I go. Listen... piss on the floor, if you like. I wish I could take a crap in the bureau drawer .\" He feels so utterl y disgu sted with himself and everything else that he doesn't know what to do by way of venting his feelings. He walks over to the bed with the bottle in his hand and pulling back the covers he sprinkles Calvados over the mattress. Not content with that he digs his heel into the mattress. Unfortunat ely there's no mud on his heels. Final ly he takes the sheet and cleans his shoes with it. \"That'l l give them something to do,\" he mutters vengeful ly. Then, taking a good swig, he throws his head back and gargles his throat, and after he's gargled it good and proper he spits it out on the mirror. \"There, you cheap bastards! Wipe that off when I go!\" He walks back and forth mumbling to himself. Seeing his torn socks lying on the floor he picks them up and tears them to bits. The paintings enrag e him too. He picks one up – a portrai t of himself done by some Lesbi an he knew and he puts his foot through it. \"That bitch! You know what she had the nerve to ask m e? She asked me to turn over my cunts to her aft er I was through with them. She never gave me a sou for writing her up. She though t I honestl y admired her work. I wouldn't have gotten that painting out of her if I hadn't prom ised to fix her up with that cunt from Minnesota. She was nuts about her... used to follow us around like a dog in heat... we couldn't get rid of the bitch! She bother ed the life out of me. I got so that I was almost afraid to bring a cunt up here for fear that she'd bust in on me. I used to creep up here like a burglar and the lock the door behind me as soon as I got inside... She and that Geor gia cunt – the y drive me nuts. The one is alwa ys in heat and the other is always hungr y. I hate fucking a woman who's hungr y. It's like you push a feed inside her and then you push it out again... Jesus, that reminds me of something... where did I put that blue ointment? That's impor tant. Did you ever have those things? It's worse than having a dose. And I don't know where I got them from either. I've had so many women up here in the last week or so I've lost track of them. Funn y too, because they all smelled so fresh. But y ou know ho w it is...\" The maid has piled his things up on the sidewalk. The patr on looks on with a surly air. When everything has been loaded into the taxi there is only room for one of us inside. As soon as we commence to roll Van Norden gets out a newspaper and starts bundling up his pots and pans; in the new place all cooking is strictly forbidden. By the time we reach our destinat ion all his luggage has come undone; it wouldn't be quite so embarasssing if the madam had not stuck her head out of the doorway just as we rolled up. \"My God!\" she exclaims, \"what in the devil is all this? What does it mean?\" Van Norden is so intimidated that he can think of nothing more to say than \"C'est moi... c 'est moi, madame!\" And turning to me he mumbles savagel y: \"That cluck! Did you notice her face? She' s going to m ake it hard for me .\" The hotel lies back of a dingy passage and forms a rectangle very much on the order of a modern penitentiary. The bureau is large and gloomy, despite the brilliant reflec tions from the tile walls. There are bird cages hanging in the window s and little enamel signs everywhere begging the guests in an obsolet e language not to do this and not to forget that. It is almost immaculately clean but absolu tely povert y - strick en, threadbar e, woebegone. The upholstered chairs are held together with wired things; they remind one unpleasan tly of the electric chair. The room he is going to occup y is on the"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"fifth floor. As we climb the stairs Van Norden inform s me that Maupassant once lived here. And in the same breath remarks that there is a peculi ar odor in the hall. On the fifth floor a few windowpanes are missing; we stand a moment gazing at the tenants across the court. It is getting toward dinner time and people are straggling back to their rooms with that weary, deject ed air which comes from earning a living honestl y. Most of the windows are wide open: the dingy rooms have the appearanc e of so many yawning mouths. The occupants of the rooms are yawning too, or else scratching themselv es. They move about listlessl y and apparentl y without much purpose; they might just as well be lunat ics. As we turn down the corridor toward room 57, a door suddenl y opens in front of us and an old hag with matted hair and the eyes of a maniac peers out. She startles us so that we stand transfix ed. For a full minute the three of us stand there powerless to move or even to make an intelligent gesture. Back of the old hag I can see a kitchen table and on it lies a baby all undressed, a puny little brat no bigger than a plucked chicken. Finall y the old one picks up a slop pa il by her side and makes a move forward. We stand aside to let her pass and as the door closes behind her the baby lets out a piercing screa m. It is room 56, and between 56 and 57 is the toilet where the old hag is emptying her slops. Ever since we have mounted the stairs Van Norden has kept silence. But his looks are eloquent. When he opens the door of 57 I have for a fleeting moment the sensat ion of going mad. A huge mirror covered with green gauze and tipped at an angle of 45 degrees hangs directly opposite the entrance over a baby carriage which is filled with books. Van Norden doesn't even crack a smile; instead he walks nonchal antly over to the baby carriage and picking up a book begins to skim it through, much as a man would enter the public library and go unthinking ly to the rack nearest to hand. And perhaps this would not seem so ludicrous to me if I had not espied at the same time a pair of handl e bars resting in the corner . They look so absolute ly peaceful and content ed, as if they had been dozing there for years, that suddenl y it seems to me as if we had been stand ing in this room , in exactly this position, for an incalculably long time, that it was a pose we had struck in a dream from which we never emerged, a dream which the least gesture, the wink of an eye even, will shatter. But more remarkab le still is the remembrance that suddenl y floats up of an actual dream which occurred only the other night, a dream in which I saw Van Norden in just such a corner as is occupied now by the handle bars, only instead of the handle bars there was a woman crouching with her legs drawn up. I see him stand ing over the woman with that alert, eager look in his eye which comes when he wants something badly. The street in which this is going on is blurred – only the angle made by the two walls is clear, and the cowering figure of the woman. I can see him going at her in that quick, animal way of his, reckless of what's going on about him, determined only to have his way. And a look in his eyes as though to say – \"you can kill me afterwards, but just let me get it in... I've got to get it in!\" And there he is, bent over her, their heads knocking against the wall, he has such a tremendous erection that it's simply impossible to get it in her. Suddenl y, with tha t disgusted air which he knows s o well how to sum mon, he picks him self up and adjusts his clothes. He is about to walk away when suddenl y he notices that his penis is lying on the sidewalk. It is about the size of a sawed - off broomst ick. He picks it up nonchalan tly and slings it under his arm. As he walks off I notice two huge bulbs, like tulip bulbs, dangling from the end of the broomstick, and I can hear him muttering to himself \"flowerpots... flowerpots.\""},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"The garçon arrives panting and sweating. Van Norden looks at him uncom prehend ingly. The madam now marches in and, walking straight up to Van Norden, she takes the book out of his hand, thrusts it in the baby carriage, and, without saying a word, wheels the baby carri age into the hallwa y. \"This is a bughouse,\" says Van Norden, smiling distressedl y. It is such a faint, indescribab le smile that for a moment the dream feeling comes back and it seems to me that we are standing at the end of along corridor at the end of which is a corrugated mirror. And down this corridor , swinging his distress like a dingy lantern, Van Norden staggers, staggers in and out as here and there a door opens and a hand yanks him, or a hoof pushes him out. And the further off he wanders the more lugubrious is his distres s; he wears it like a lantern which the cyclists hold between their teeth on a night when the pavement is wet and slipper y. In and out of the dingy rooms he wanders, and when he sits down the chair collapses, when he opens his valise there is only a toothbrush inside. In every room there is a mirror before which he stands attentively and chews his rage, and from the constant chewing, from the grumbling and mumbling and the muttering and cursing his jaws have gotten unhinged and they sag badly and, when he rubs his beard, pieces of his jaw crumble away and he's so disgusted with himself that he stamps on his o wn jaw , grinds it to bits with his big heels. Meanwhile the luggage is being hauled in. And things begin to look crazier even than before – particularly when he attach es his exerciser to the bedstead and begins his Sando w exerc ises. \"I like this place,\" he says, smiling at the garçon. He takes his coat and vest off. The garçon is watching him with a puzzled air; he has a valise in one hand and the douche bag in the other. I'm standing apart in the antecha mber holding the mirror with the green gauze. Not a single object seems to possess a practical use. The antech amber itself seems useless, a sort of vestibu le to a barn. It is exact ly the same sort of sensation which I get when I enter the Comédie - Française or the Palais-Ro yal Theatr e; it is a world of bric - a - brac, of trap doors, of arms and busts and waxed floors, of candel abras and men in armor, of statues withou t eyes and love letters lying in glass cases. Something is going on, but it makes no sense; it's like finishing the half - empty bottle of Calvados because ther e's no roo m in the valise. Climbing up the stairs, as I said a moment ago, he had mentioned the fact that Maupas sant used to live here. The coinc idence seems to have made an impression upon him. He would l ike to believ e that it was in this ver y room that Maupassant gave birth to some of those gruesom e tales on which his reputa tion rests. \"They lived like pigs, those poor bastards,\" he says. We are sitting at the round table in a pair of comfort able old armchairs that have been trussed up with thongs and braces; the bed is right beside us, so close indeed that we can put our feet on it. The armoi re stands in a corner behind us, also conveni ently within reach. Van Norden has emptied his dirty wash on the table; we sit there with our feet buried in his dirty socks and shirts and smoke conten tedly. The sordidn ess of the place seems to have worked a spell on him: he is conten t here. When I get up to switch on the light he suggests that we play a game of cards before going out to eat. And so we sit there by the window , with the dirty wash strewn over the floor and the Sandow exerc iser hanging from the chandeli er, and we play a few rounds of two - handed pinoch le. Van Norden has put away his pipe and packed a wad of snuff on the underside of his lower lip. Now and then he spits out of the window , big healthy gobs of brown juice which resound with a smack on the pavement below . He seem s content now."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"\"In America,\" he says, \"you wouldn't dream of living in a joint like this. Even when I was on the bum I slept in better rooms than this. But here it seems natura l – it's like the books you read. If I ever go back there I'll forget all about this life, just like you forget a bad dream . I'll probabl y take up the old life again just where I left off... if I ever get back. Sometimes I lie in bed dreaming about the past and it's so vivid to me that I have to shake myself in order to realize where I am. Espec ially when I have a woman beside me; a woman can set me off better than anything. That's all I want of them – to forget myself. Sometimes I get so lost in my reveries that I can't remember the name of the cunt or where I picked her up. That's funny, eh? It's good to have a fresh warm body beside you when you wake up in the morning. It gives you a clean feeling. You get spiritual like... until they start pulling that mush y crap about love et cetera. Why do all these cunts talk about love so much, can you tell me that? A good lay isn't enough for them apparent ly... they want y our soul too...\" Now this word soul, which pops up frequent ly in Van Norden' s soliloqu ies, used to have a droll effect upon me at first. When ever I heard the word soul from his lips I would get hysterical; somehow it seemed like a false coin, more particu larly because it was usuall y accompanied by a gob of brown juice which left a trickle down the corner of his mouth. And as I never hesita ted to laugh in his face it happened invariab ly that when this little word bobbed up Van Norden would pause just long enough for me to burst into a cackl e and then, as if nothing had happened, he would resum e his monologue, repea ting the word more and more frequen tly and each time with a more caressing emphasis. It was the soul of him that women were trying to posse ss – that he made clear to me. He has explained it over and over again, but he comes back to it afresh each time like a paranoi ac to his obsession. In a sense Van Norden is mad, of that I'm convin ced. His one fear is to be left alone, and this fear is so deep and so persistent that even when he is on top of a woman, even when he has welded himself to her, he cannot escape the prison which he has created for himself. \"I try all sorts of things,\" he explains tome. \"I even count sometimes, or I begin to think of a proble m in philosoph y, but it doesn 't work. It's like I'm two people, and one of the m is watch ing me all the time. I get so goddam ned mad at myself that I could kill myself... and in a way, that's what I do every time I have an orgasm. For one second like I obliterate myself. There's not even one me then... there's nothing... not even the cunt. It's like receiving communion. Honest, I mean that. For a few seconds afterwards I have a fine spiritual glow... and maybe it would continue that way indef initely – how can you tell? – if it weren't for the fact that there's a woman beside you and then the douche bag and the water running... all those little details that make you despera tely selfconscious, desperat ely lonel y. And for that one moment of freedo m you have to listen to all that love crap... it drives me nuts sometimes... I want to kick them out immediately... I do now and then. But that doesn 't keep them away. They like it, in fact. The less you notice them the more they chase after you. There's something perverse about women... they're all maso chists at heart.\" \"But what is i t you want of a woman, then?\" I dem and. He begins to mold his hands; his lower lip droop s. He looks completely frustrat ed. When eventually he succeeds in stammering out a few broken phrases it's with the convict ion that behind his words lies an overwhel ming futility. \"I want to be able to surrender myself to a woman,\" he blurts out. \"I want her to take me out of myself. But to do tha t, she's got to be better than I am; she's got to have a mind, not just a cunt. She's got to make me believe that I need her, that I can't live without her. Find me a cunt like"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"that, will you? If you could do that I'd give you my job. I wouldn't care then what happened to me: I wouldn't need a job or friends or books or anything. If she could only make me believe that there was something more importan t on earth then myself. Jesus, I hate myself! But I hate these bastardl y cunts even more – because they're none of them any good. \"You think I like myself,\" he continu es. \"That shows how little you know about me. I know I'm a great guy... I wouldn't have these proble ms if there weren't something to me. But what eats me up is that I can't express myself. People think I'm a cunt - chaser . That's how shallow they are, these high brows who sit on the terrasse all day chewing the psychologi c cud... That's not so bad, eh – psychologic cud? Write it down for me. I'll use it in my column next week... By the way, did you ever read Stekel? Is he any good? It looks like nothing but case histories to me. I wish to Christ I could get up enough nerve to visit an analyst... a good one, I mean. I don't want to see these little shysters with goatees and frock coats, like your friend Boris. How do you manage to tolera te those guys? Don't they bore you stiff? You talk to anybody, I notice. You don't give a goddam n. Maybe you're right. I wish I weren 't so damned critical. But these dirty little Jews who hang around the Dôme, Jesus, they give me the creeps. They sound just like textbooks. If I could talk to you every day maybe I could get things off my chest. You're a good listene r. I know you don't give a damn about me, but you're patien t. And you don't have any theories to exploit. I suppo se you put it all down afterward in that notebook of yours. Listen, I don't mind what you say about me, but don't make me out to be a cunt - chaser – it's too simple. Some day I'll write a book about myself, about my thoughts. I don't mean just a piece of introspect ive analysis... I mean that I'll lay myself down on the operating table and I'll expose my whole guts... every godda mned thing. Has anybody ever done that before ? – What the hell are you smiling at? Does it sound naïf?\" I'm smiling because whenever we touch on the subject of this book which he is going to write some day things assume an incongruous aspect. He has only to say \"my book\" and immediately the world shrinks to the privat e dimensions of Van Norden and Co. The book must be absolute ly origina l, absolut ely perfe ct. That is why, among other things, it is impossibl e for him to get started on it. As soon as he gets an idea he begins to question it. He remembers that Dostoevski used it, or Hamsun, or somebod y else. \"I'm not saying that I want to be better than them, but I want to be different,\" he explains. And so, instead of tackling his book, he reads one author after anoth er in order to make absolute ly certain that he is not going to tread on their private propert y. And the more he reads the more disda inful he becom es. None of them are satisf ying; none of them arrive at that degree of perfect ion which he has imposed on himself. And forgetting completely that he has not written as much as a chapter he talks about them condescending ly, quite as though there existed a shelf of books bearing his name, books which everyone is familiar with and the titles of which it is therefor e superfluous to mention. Though he has never overtl y lied about this fact, never theless it is obvious that the people whom he buttonholes in order to air his privat e philosoph y, his criticism, and his grievanc es, take it for grant ed tha t behind his loose rem arks ther e stands a solid body of work. Espec ially the young and foolish virgins whom he lures to his room on the pretext of reading to them his poems, or on the still better pretex t of asking their advice. Withou t the least feeling of guilt or selfconsciousness he will hand them a piece of soiled paper on which he has scribbl ed a few lines – the basis of a new poem , as he puts it – and with absolute seriousness demand of them an honest expression of opinion. As"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"they usuall y have noth ing to give by way of comment, wholl y bewildered as they are by the utter senselessness of the lines, Van Norden seizes the occasion to expound to them his view of art, a view, needless to say, which is spontaneousl y created to suit the event. So expert has he becom e in this role that the transi tion from Ezra Pound' s cantos to the bed is made as simply and natural ly as a modulation from one key to another ; in fact, if it were not made there would be a discord, which is what happens now and then when he makes a mistake as regards those nitwits whom he refers to as \"push - overs.\" Naturall y, consti tuted as he is, it is with reluct ance that he refers to these fatal errors of judgment. But when he does bring himself to confess to an error of this kind it is with absolute franknes s; in fact, he seems to derive a perverse pleasure in dwell ing upon his inaptitude. There is one woman, for example, whom he has been trying to make for almost ten years now – first in Amer ica, and final ly here in Paris. It is the only person of the opposite sex with whom he has a cordial, friendl y relationship. They seem not only to like each other , but to understand each other. At first it seem ed to me that if he could really make this creature his probl em might be solved. All the elements for a successful union were there – excep t the fundam ental one. Bessie was almost as unusual in her way as himself. She had as little concern about giving herself to a man as she has about the dessert which follows the meal. Usually she singled out the object of her choice and made the proposition herself. She was not bad - looking, nor could one say that she was good-looking either. She had a fine body, that was the chief thing – and she liked it, as they say. They were so chum my, these two, that sometimes, in order to gratify her curiosi ty (and also in the vain hope of inspiring her by his prowes s), Van Norden would arrange to hide her in his close t during one of his seances. After it was over Bessie would emerge from her hiding place and they would discus s the matter casuall y, that is to say, with an almost total indifferenc e to everything excep t \"techniqu e.\" Technique was one of her favorit e terms, at least in those discus sions which I was privileged to enjoy. \"What's wrong with my technique?\" he would say. And Bessie would answer: \"You're too crude. If you ever expec t to make me you've got to becom e more subtle.\" There was such a perfe ct understand ing between them, as I say, that often when I called for Van Norden at one-thirt y, I would find Bessie sitting on the bed, the covers thrown back and Van Norden inviting her to stroke his penis... \"just a few silken strokes,\" he would say, \"so as I'll have the courage to get up.\" Or else he would urge her to blow on it, or failing that, he would grab hold of himself and shake it like a dinner bell, the two of them laugh ing fit to die. \"I'll never make this bitch,\" he would say. \"She has no respect for me. That's what I get for taking her into my confiden ce.\" And then abruptl y he might add: \"What do you make of that blonde I showed you yesterda y?\" Talking to Bessie, of course. And Bessie would jeer at him, telling him he had no taste. \"Aw, don't give me that line,\" he would say. And then playfully, perhaps for the thousandth time, because by now it had become a standing joke between them – \"Listen, Bessie, what about a quick lay? Just one little lay... no.\" And when this had passed off in the usual manner he would add, in the same tone: \"Well, what about him? Why don't y ou give him a lay?\" The whole point about Bessie was that she couldn't, or just wouldn't, regard herself as a lay. She talked about passion, as if it were a brand new word. She was passionate about th ings, even a l ittle thing like a lay. She had to put her soul into it. \"I get passionat e too so metimes,\" Van Norden would sa y."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"\"Oh, you ,\" says Bessie. \"You're just a worn - out satyr. You don't know the meaning of passion. When y ou get an erect ion y ou think you're passiona te.\" \"All right, maybe it's not passion... but you can't get passionat e without having an erection, tha t's true isn't it?\" All this about Bessie, and the other women whom he drags to his rooms day in and out, occupi es my thoughts as we walk to the restaurant. I have adjusted myself so well to his monologu es that without interrup ting my own reveries I make whatever comment is requir ed automatically, the moment I hear his voice die out. It is a duet, and like most duets moreover in that one listens attentively only for the signal which announces the advent of one's own voice. As it is his night off, and as I have promised to keep him company, I have alread y dulled myself to his queri es. I know that before the evening is over I shall be thoroughl y exhausted ; if I am lucky, that is, if I can worm a few francs out of him on some pretext or other , I will duck him the moment he goes to the toilet. But he knows m y propensit y for slipping away, and, inste ad of being insult ed, he simply provides against the possibility by guarding his sous. If I ask him for money to buy cigare ttes he insists on going with me to purchase them. He will not be left alone, not for a second. Even when he has succeeded in grabbing off a woman, even then he is terrified to be left alone with her. If it were possible he would have me sit in the room while he puts on the perfor mance. It would be like asking me to wait while he took a shave. On his night off Van Norden gener ally manages to have at least fifty francs in his pocket, a circumstance which does not preven t him from making a touch whenever he encounters a prospect. \"Hello,\" he says, \"give me twent y francs... I need it.\" He has a way of looking panic - stricken at the same time. And if he meets with a rebuf f he becomes insult ing. \"Well, you can buy a drink at least.\" And when he gets his drink he says more graciousl y – \"Listen give me five francs then... give me two francs...\" We go from bar to bar looking for a little excitement and always accumulating a few more francs. At the Coupole we stumble into a drunk from the newspape r. One of the upstairs guys. There's just been an accident at the office, he informs us. One of the proofread ers fell down the elevator shaft. Not expected to liv e. At first Van Norden is shocked, deepl y shocked. But when he learns that it was Peckover , the Englishman, he looks relieved. \"The poor bastard,\" he says, \"he's better off dead than alive. He just got his false tee th the other da y too...\" The al lusion to the false teeth moves the man upstairs to tears. He rel ates in a slobber y way a little incident conne cted with the acciden t. He is upset about it, more upset about this little incident than about the catastrophe itself. It seem s that Peckover , when he hit the botto m of the shaft, regained consciousness before anyone could reach him. Despite the fact that his legs were broken and his ribs busted, he had managed to rise to all fours and grope about for his false teeth. In the ambulan ce he was crying out in his delirium for the teeth he had lost. The inciden t was pathet ic and ludicrous at the same time. The guy from upstairs hardl y knew whether to laugh or to weep as he related it. It was a delicate moment because with a drunk like that, one false move and he'd crash a bottle over your skull. He had never been particularly friendl y with Peckover – as a matter of fact, he had scarcel y ever set foot in the proofreading depart ment: there was an invisible wall like betwe en the guys upstairs and the guys down below . But now, since he had felt the touch of death, he wanted to displa y his comradeship. He wanted to weep, if"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"possible, to show that he wa s a regular guy. And J oe and I, who knew Peckover well and who knew also that he wasn't worth a good godda mn, even a few tears, we felt annoyed with this drunken sentimentality. We wanted to tell him so too, but with a guy like that you can't af ford to be honest; you have to bu y a wreath and go to the funera l and pret end that you're miserable. And you have to congratu late him too for the delica te obituar y he's written. He'll be carrying his delicate little obituar y around with him for months, praising the shit out of himself for the way he handl ed the situation. We felt all that, Joe and I. without saying a word to each other. We just stood there and listened with a murderous, silent conte mpt. And as soon as we could break away we did so; we left him there at the bar blubbering to hi mself over his Pernod. Once out of his sight we began to laugh hysterically. The false teeth! No matter what we said about the poor devil, and we said some good things about him too, we always came back to the false teeth. There are people in this world who cut such a grotesque figure tha t even death renders the m ridiculous. And the m ore horrible the dea th the more ridicu lous they seem. It's no use trying to invest the end with a little digni ty – you have to be a liar and a hypocrite to discover anything tragic in their going. And since we didn't have to put on a false front we could laugh about the incident to our heart's content. We laughed all night about it, and in betwe en times we vented our scorn and disgu st for the guys upstairs, the fatheads who were trying to persuade themselves, no doubt, that Peckover was a fine fellow and that his death was a catastrophe. All sorts of funny recoll ections came to our minds – the semicolons that he overlooked and for which they bawled the piss out of him. They made his life miserable with their fucking little semicolons and the fractions which he always got wrong. They were even going to fire him once because he came to work with a boozy breath. They despised him because he always looked so miserable and because he had eczema and dandruf f. He was just a nobod y, as far as the y were concerned, but, now tha t he was dead, they would all chip in lustil y and buy him a huge wreath and they'd put his name in big type in the obituar y column. Anything to throw a little reflection on themselv es; they'd make him out to be a big shit if they could. But unfortun ately, with Peckove r, there was little they could invent about him. He was a zero, and even the fact that he was dead wouldn't add a cipher to his na me. \"There's only one good aspec t to it,\" says Joe. \"You may get his job. And if you have any luck, maybe you'll fall down the elevator shaft and break your neck too. We'll buy you a nice wreath, I pro mise you that.\" Toward dawn we're sitting on the terrasse of the Dôme. We've forgotten about poor Peckover long ago. We've had a little excitement at the Bal Nègre and Joe's mind has slipped back to the eterna l preoccupa tion: cunt. It's at this hour, when his night off is almost concluded, that his restlessnes s mounts to a fever pitch. He thinks of the women he passed up earlier in the evening and of the stead y ones he might have had for the asking, if it weren't that he was fed up with them. He is reminded inevit ably of his Georgia cunt – she's been hounding him lately, begging him to take her in, at least until she can find herself a job. \"I don't mind giving her a feed once in a while,\" he says, \"but I couldn't take her on as a stead y thing... she'd ruin it for my other cunts.\" Wha t gripes him most about her is that she doesn't put on any flesh. \"It's like taking a skeleton to bed with you,\" he says. \"The other night I took her on – out of pity – and what do you think the crazy bitch had done to herself? She. had shaved it clean... not a speck of hair on it."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Did you ever have a woman who shaved her twat? It's repulsive, ain't it? And it's funny, too. Sort of mad like. It doesn't look like a twat any more: it's like a dead clam or something.\" He describes to me how, his curiosit y aroused, he got out of bed and searched for his flashlight. \"I made her hold it open and I trained the flashligh t on it. You should have seen me... it was comical. I got so worked up about it that I forgot all about her. I never in my life looked at a cunt so seriousl y. You'd imagine I'd never seen one before. And the more I looked at it the less interesting it became. It only goes to show you there's nothing to it after all, especia lly when it's shaved. It's the hair that makes it mysterious. That's why a statue leaves you cold. Only once I saw a real cunt on a statue – that was by Rodin. You ought to see it some time... she has her legs spread wide apart... I don't think there was any head on it. Just a cunt you might say. Jesus, it looked ghastl y. The thing is this – they all look alike. When you look at them with their clothes on you imagine all sorts of things: you give them an indiv iduality like, which they haven't got, of course. There's just a crack there between the legs and you get all steamed up about it – you don't even look at it half the time. You know it's there and all you think about is getting your ramrod inside ; it's as though your penis did the thinking for you. It's an illusion! You get all burned up about nothing... about a crack with hair on it, or withou t hair. It's so absolu tely meaning less that it fascin ated me to look at it. I must have studied it for ten minutes or more. When you look at it that way, sort of detach ed like, you get funny notions in your head. All that mystery about sex and then you discover that it's nothing – just a blank. Wouldn't it be funny if you found a harm onica inside... or a calendar? But there's nothing there... nothing at all. It's disgu sting. It almost drove me mad... Listen, do you know what I did afterwards ? I gave her a quick lay and then I turned my back on her. Yeah, I picked up a book and I read. You can get something out of a book, even a bad book... but a cunt, it's just sheer loss of t ime...\" It just so happened that as he was concluding his speech a whore gave us the eye. Withou t the slightest transi tion he says to me abruptl y: \"Would you like to give her a tumble? It won't cost much... she'll take the two of us on.\" And without waiting for a reply he staggers to his feet and goes over to her. In a few minutes he comes back. \"It's all fixed,\" he says. \"Finish your beer. She's hungr y. There's nothing doing any more at this hour... she'll take the both of us for fifteen francs. We'll go to my room ... it'll be cheape r.\" On the way to the hotel the girl is shiver ing so that we have to stop and buy her a coffee. She's a rather gentle sort of creature and not at all bad to look at. She eviden tly knows Van Norden, knows there's nothing to expec t from him but the fifteen francs. \"You haven't got any dough,\" he says, mumbling to me under his breath. As I haven't a centime in my pocket I don't quite see the point of this, until he bursts out: \"For Christ' s sake, remember that we're broke. Don't get tenderh earted when we get upsta irs. She's going to ask you for a little extra – I know this cunt! I could get her for ten francs, if I wanted to. There's no u se spoil ing the m...\" \"Il est méchant, celui - là,\" she says to me, gathering the drift of his re marks in her dull way. \"Non, il n'est pa s méchant, il est très genti l.\" She shakes her head laugh ingly. \"Je le connais bien, ce type. \" And then she commences a hard luck story, about the hospital and the back rent and the baby in the"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"countr y. But she doesn 't overdo it. She knows that our ears are stopped; but th e misery is there inside her, like a stone, and there's no room for any other thoughts. She isn't trying to make an appeal to our sympathies – she's just shifting this big weight inside her from one plac e to ano ther. I rather like he r. I hope to Christ she hasn't got a disease... In the room she goes about her preparat ions mechani cally. \"There isn't a crust of bread about by any chanc e?\" she inquir es, as she squats over the bidet. Van Norden laughs at this. \"Here, take a drink,\" he says, shoving a bottle at her. She doesn 't want anything to drink; her stom ach's alre ady on the bum , she co mplains. \"That's just a line with her,\" says Van Norden. \"Don't let her work on your sympathies. Just the same, I wish she'd talk about something else. How the hell can you get up an y passion when y ou've got a starving cunt on y our hands? \" Precisel y! We haven't any passion either of us. And as for her, one might as well expect her to produce a diamond neckl ace as to show a spark of passion. But there's the fifteen francs and something has to be done about it. It's like a state of war: the moment the condi tion is precipi tated nobod y thinks about anything but peace, about getting it over with. And yet nobod y has the courage to lay down his arms, to say, \"I'm fed up with it... I'm through.\" No, there's fifteen francs somewhere, which nobod y gives a damn about any more and which nobod y is going to get in the end anyhow, but the fifteen francs is like the primal cause of things and rather than listen to one's own voice, rather than walk out on the primal cause, one surrenders to the situat ion, one goes on butchering and butch ering and the more cowardl y one feels the more heroica lly does he behave, until a day when the botto m drops out and sudden ly all the guns are silenced and the stretcher - bearers pick up the maimed and bleeding heroes and pin medals on their chest. Then one has the rest of his life to think about the fifteen francs. One hasn't any eyes or arms or legs, but he has the consolation of dreaming for the rest of his days about the fifteen francs which everybody has for gotten. It's exactly like a state of war – I can't get it out of my head. The way she works over me, to blow a spark of passion into me, makes me think what a damned poor soldier I'd be if I was ever silly enough to be trapped like this and dragged to the front. I know for my part that I'd surrender everything, honor included, in order to get out of the mess. I haven't any stomach for it, and that's all there is to it. But she's got her mind set on the fifteen francs and if I don't want to fight about it she's going to make me fight. But you can't put fight into a man's guts if he hasn't any fight in him. There are some of us so cowardl y that you can't ever make heroes of us, not even if you frighten us to death. We know too much, maybe. There are some of us who don't live in the moment, who live a little ahead, or a little behind. My mind is on the peace treaty all the time. I can't forget that it was the fifteen francs which started all the troub le. Fifteen francs! What does fifteen francs m ean to m e, parti cularl y since i t's not my fifteen francs? Van Norden seems to have a more norm al attitude about it. He doesn't care a rap about the fifteen francs either now; it's the situat ion itself which intrigues him. It seems to call for a show of mettle – his manhood is involved. The fifteen francs are lost, whether we succeed or not. There's something more involved – not just manhood perhaps, but will. It's like a ma n in the tren ches again : he doesn't know an y more why he should go on living, because if he escapes now he'll only be caugh t later, but he goes on just the same, and even though he has the soul of a cockro ach and has admitted as much to himself, give him a gun or a knife or even just his bare nails, and he'll go on slaughtering and slaught ering, he'd slaught er a million men rather than stop and ask"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"himself why. As I watch Van Norden t ackle her, it seems to me that I'm looking at a machine whose cogs have slipped. Left to themselves, they could go on this way forever , grinding and slipping, without ever anything happening. Until a hand shuts the motor off. The sight of them coupled like a pair of goats without the least spark of passion, grind ing and grinding away for no reason exc ept the fifteen francs, washes awa y every bit of feeling I have except the inhuman one of satisf ying my curiosit y. The girl is lying on the edge of the bed and Van Norden is bent over her like a satyr with his two feet solidl y planted on the floor. I am sitting on a chair behind him, watching their movements with a cool, scientif ic detach ment; it doesn't matter to me if it should last foreve r. It's like watching one of those crazy machines which throw the newspaper out, millions and billions and trillions of them with their meaningl ess headlines. The machine seems more sensible, crazy as it is, and more fascina ting to watch, than the human beings and the events which produced it. My interest in Van Norden and the girl is nil; if I could sit like this and watch every single perform ance going on at this minute all over the world my interest would be even less than nil. I wouldn't be able to differen tiate between this phenom enon and the rain falling or a volcano erupt ing. As long as that spark of passion is missing there is no human significanc e in the perform ance. The machine is better to watch. And these two are like a machine which has slipped its cogs. It needs the touch of a hu man hand to set i t right. It needs a mechani c. I get down on my knees behind Van Norden and I examine the machine more attentively. The girl throws her head on one side and gives me a despairing look. \"It's no use,\" she says. \"It's impossible.\" Upon which Van Norden sets to work with renewed energy, just like an old billy goat. He's such an obstina te cuss that he'll break his horns rather than give up. And he' s getting sore now bec ause I'm tickling him in the ru mp. \"For G od's s ake, Joe, give it up! You'll ki ll the poor girl.\" \"Leave me alone,\" he grunts. \"I alm ost got it in that time.\" The posture and the determined way in which he blurts this out suddenl y bring to my mind, for the second time, the remembrance of my dream. Only now it seem s as though that broomstick, which he had so nonchal antly slung under his arm, as he walked away, is lost foreve r. It is like the sequel to the dream – the same Van Norden, but minus the primal cause. He's like a hero come back from the war, a poor maimed bastard living out the reality of his dreams. Wherever he sits himself the chair collapses; whatever door he enters the room is empty: whatever he puts in his mouth leaves a bad taste. Everything is just the same as it was before; the elements are unchanged, the dream is no differen t than the reality. Only, between the time he went to sleep and the time he woke up, his body was stolen. He's like a machine throwing out newspapers, millions and billions of them every day, and the front page is loaded with catastroph es, with riots, murd ers, explosions, collisions, but he doesn't feel anything. If somebody doesn't turn the switch off he'll never know what it means to die; you can't die if your own proper body has been stolen. You can get over a cunt and work away like a billy goat until eternity; you can go to the trenches and be blown to bits; nothing will create that spark of passion if there isn't the intervent ion of a human hand. Somebod y has to put his hand into the machine and let it be wrench ed off if the cogs are to mesh again. Somebody has to do this without hope of reward, without concern over the fifteen francs; somebody whose chest is so thin that a medal would make him hunchbacked. And somebod y has to throw a feed into a starving cunt without fear of pushing it out"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"again. Otherwise this sho w'll go on forever . There's no wa y out of the m ess... After sucking the boss's ass for a whole week – it's the th ing to do here – I ma naged to land Peckover's job. He died all right, the poor devil, a few hours after he hit the botto m of the shaft. And just as I predic ted, they gave him a fine funeral, with solemn mass, huge wreaths, and everything. Tout compris. And after the ceremonies they regaled themselv es, the upsta irs guys, at a bistr o. It was too bad Peckover couldn't have had just a little snack – he would have appre ciated it so much to sit with the men upstairs and hear his own na me mentioned so frequent ly. I must say, right at the start, that I haven't a thing to complain about. It's like being in a lunati c asylum, with permission to masturb ate for the rest of your life. The world is brought right under my nose and all that is request ed of me is to punctua te the calamities. There is nothing in which these slick guys upstairs do not put their fingers: no joy, no misery passe s unnot iced. They live among the hard facts of life, reality, as it is called. It is the reality of a swamp and they are the frogs who have nothing better to do than to croak. The more they croak the more real life becomes. Lawyer, priest, doctor , politi cian, newspaper man – these are the quacks who have their fingers on the pulse of the world. A constant atmospher e of calamity. It's marvelous. It's as if the barom eter never changed, as if the flag were always at half - mast. One can see now how the idea of heaven takes hold of men's consciousnes s, how it gains ground even when all the props have been knocked from under it. There must be another world beside this swamp in which everything is dumped pell - mell. It's hard to imagine what it can be like, this heaven that men dream about. A frog's heaven, no doubt. Mias ma, scum, pond lilies, stagnant water . Sit on a lily pad unmolested and croak all day. Something like that, I imagine. They have a wonderful therapeut ic effect upon me, these catastroph es which I proofread. Imagine a state of perfec t immunity, a charmed existence, a life of absolute securit y in the midst of poison bacilli. Nothing touch es me, neither earthquakes nor explosions nor riots nor famine nor collisions nor wars nor revolut ions. I am inocul ated against every disease, every calamity, every sorrow and misery. It's the culmination of a life of fortitude. Seated at my little niche all the poisons which the world gives off each day pass through my hands. Not even a fingerna il gets stained. I am absolutel y immune. I am even better off than a labor atory attendant, because there are no bad odors here, just the smell of lead burning. The world can blow up – I'll be here just the same to put in a comma or a semicolon. I may even touch a little overti me, for with an event like that there's bound to be a final extra. When the world blows up and the final edition has gone to press the proofreaders will quietl y gather up all commas, semicolons, hyphens, asterisks, brack ets, parentheses, periods, excla mation marks, etc. and put them in a little box over the editori al cha ir. Co mme ça tout est régl é... None of my companions seem to understand why I appear so content ed. They grum ble all the time, they have ambitions, they want to show their pride and spleen. A good proofreader has no ambitions, no pride, no spleen. A good proofread er is a little like God Almighty, he's in the world but not of it. He's for Sunda ys only. Sunda y is his night off. On Sunda ys he steps down from his pedestal and shows his ass to the faithful. Once a week he listens in on all the private grief and misery of the world; it's enough to last him for the rest of the week. The rest of the week he remains in the frozen winter marshes, an absolut e, an impeccab le absolute, with only a vaccination mark to distinguish hi m from the immense void."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The greatest calamity for a proofreader is the threat of losing his job. When we get together in the break the question that sends a shiver down our spines is: what'l l you do if you lose your job?

To tell him that it is disgu sting to spend one's life shoveling up hot turds is a piece of imbecility. A man can get to love shit if his live lihood depends on it, if his happiness is involved. This life which, if I were still a man with pride, honor , ambition and so forth, would seem like the botto m rung of degradat ion, I welco me now, as an invalid welco mes death. It's a negative reality, just like death – a sort of heaven without the pain and terror of dying. In this chthonian world the only thing of impor tance is orthograph y and punctuat ion.

It's as though I had been convert ed to a new religion, as though I were making an annual novena every night to Our Lady of Solac e. I can't imagine what there would be to gain if I were made editor of the paper , or even President of the United States. I'm up a blind alley, and it's cosy and comfortab le. With a piece of copy in my hand I listen to the music around me, the hum and drone of voices, the tinkle of the linotype machines, as if there were a thousand silver brace lets passing through a wringer; now and then a rat scurries past our feet or a cockroa ch descends the wall in front of us, moving nimbly and gingerl y on his delicate legs. The events of the day are slid under your nose, quietly, unostentatiously, with, now and then, a by - line to mark the presence of a human hand, an ego, a touch of vanit y. The procession passes serenel y, like a corteg e enter ing the cemetery gates. The paper under the copy desk is s o thick tha t it almost feels like a carpe t with a soft nap.

Wha t seems strange to me sometimes, when I crawl into bed, is that all this enthusiasm is engend ered just to kill time, just to annihi late the three - quarters of an hour which it requires to walk from the office to Montparnasse. We might have the most brilliant, the most feasib le ideas for the amelioration of this or that, but there is no vehicl e to hitch them to. And what is more strange is that the absence of any relationship between ideas and living causes us no anguish, no disco mfort. We have becom e so adjusted that, if tomorrow we were ordered to walk on our hands, we would do so withou t the slightest protest. Provided, of course, that the paper came out as usual. And that we touch ed our pay regul arly. Otherwise nothing matters. Nothing. We have becom e Orient alized. We have become coolies, white-col lar coolies, silenced by a handful of rice each day. A speci al feature in American skulls, I was reading the other day, is the presenc e of the epact al bone, or os Incae, in the occiput. The presence of this bone, so the savant went on to say, is due to a persistence of the transverse occipi tal suture which is usuall y closed in fetal life. Hence it is a sign of arrested development and indicative of an inferior race. \"The average cubica l capacity of the American skull,\" so he went on to say, \"falls below that of the white, and rises above that of the black race. Taking both sexes, the Parisians of today have a cranial capac ity of 1,448 cubic centimeters; the Negroes 1,344 centimeters; the American Indians 1,376.\" From all of which I deduc e nothing because I am an American and not an Indian. But it's cute to explain things that way, by a bone, an os Incae, for example. It doesn't disturb his theor y at all to admit that single examples of Indian skulls have yielded the extraordin ary capacity of 1,920 cubic centimeters, a crania l capacity not exceeded in any other race. What I note with satisfact ion is that the Parisians, of both sexes, see m to have a norm al crania l capa city. The transverse occipi tal suture is eviden tly not so persistent with them. They know how to enjoy an apérit if and they don't worry if the houses are unpaint ed. There's nothing extraordin ary about their skulls, so far as crania l indices go. There must be some other explana tion for the art of"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"living which the y have brought to such a degree of perfect ion. At Monsieur Paul's, the bistr o across the way, there is a back room reserved for the newspaper men where we can eat on credit. It is a pleasant little room with sawdust on the floor and flies in season and out. When I say that it is reserved for the newspaper men I don't mean to imply that we eat in privac y; on the contr ary, it means that we have the privileg e of associat ing with the whores and pimps who form the more substan tial element of M onsieur Paul' s clientele. The arrange ment suits the gu ys upstairs to a T, because they're always on the lookou t for tail, and even those who have a stead y little French girl are not averse to making a switch now and then. The principal thing is not to get a dose; at times it would seem as if an epidemic had swept the office, or perhaps it might be expla ined by the fact that they all sleep with the same woman. Anyhow, it's gratifying to observe how miserabl e they can look when they are obliged to sit beside a pimp who, despite the little hardships of his profes sion, lives a life of luxur y by compar ison. I'm thinking particu larly now of one tall, blonde fellow who delivers the Havas messages by bicycle. He is always a little late for his meal, always perspiring profu sely and his face cover ed with grime. He has a fine, awkward way of strolling in, saluting everybody with two fingers and making a beelin e for the sink which is just between the toilet and the kitchen. As he wipes his face he gives the edibles a quick inspec tion; if he sees a nice steak lying on the slab he picks it up and sniffs it, or he will dip the ladle into the big pot and try a mouthful of soup. He's like a fine bloodhound, his nose to the ground all the time. The preliminaries over, having made peepee and blown his nose vigorousl y, he walks nonchal antly over to his wench and gives her a big, smacking kiss together with an affectionate pat on the rump. Her, the wench, I've never seen look anything but immaculate – even at three a.m., after an even ing's work. She looks exac tly as if she had just stepped out of a Turkish bath. It's a pleasure to look at such healthy brutes, to see such repose, such affection, such appeti te as they displa y. It's the evening meal I'm speaking of now, the little snack that she takes before entering upon her duties. In a little while she will be obliged to take leave of her big blonde brute, to flop somewher e on the boulevard and sip her digest if. If the job is irksom e or wearing or exhaustive, she certainly doesn't show it. When the big fellow arrives, hungr y as a wolf, she puts her arms around him and kisses him hungril y – his eyes, nose, cheeks, hair, the back of his neck... she'd kiss his ass if it could be done publi cly. She's gratefu l to him, that's eviden t. She's no wage slave. All through the meal she laughs convulsiv ely. You wouldn't think she had a care in the world. And now and then, by way of affection, she gives him a resounding slap in the face, such a whack as would knock a proofread er spinning. They don't seem to be aware of anything but themselves and the food that they pack away in shovelsful. Such perfect content ment, such harm ony, such mutual understanding, it drives Van Norden crazy to watch them. Especia lly when she slips her hand in the big fellow's fly and caresses it, to which he gener ally responds by grabbing her tea t and squeez ing it playfully. There is another coupl e who arrive usually about the same time and they behave just like two married people. They have their spats, they wash their linen in public and after they've made things disagre eable for themselves and everybody else, after threats and curses and reproaches and recriminations, they make up for it by billing and cooing, just like a pair of turtle doves. Lucienn e, as he calls her, is a heavy platinum blonde with a"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"cruel, saturnine air. She has a full underl ip which she chews venomousl y when her temper runs away with her. And a cold, beady eye, a sort of faded china blue, which makes him sweat when she fixes him with it. But she's a good sort, Lucienn e, despite the condor - like profile which she presents to us when the squabbl ing begins. Her bag is always full of dough, and if she deals it out cautiousl y, it is only because she doesn't want to encour age him in his bad habits. He has a weak character; that is, if one takes Lucienn e's tirades seriousl y. He will spend fifty francs of an evening while waiting for her to get through. When the waitress comes to take his order he has no appetite. \"Ah, you're not hungr y again!\" growls Lucienne. \"Humpf! You were waiting for me, I suppose, on the Faubour g Montmartre. You had a good time, I hope, while I slaved for you. Speak, imbec ile, whe re wer e you? \" When she flares up like that, when she gets enraged, he looks up at her timidly and then, as if he had decid ed that silenc e was the best course, he lets his head drop and he fiddles with his napkin. But this little gesture, which she knows so well and which of course is secret ly pleasing to her because she is convinc ed now that he is guilty, only increases Lucienne's anger. \" Speak, imbecil e! \" she shrieks. And with a squeak y, timid little voice he explains to her woefull y that while waiting for her he got so hungr y that he was obliged to stop off for a sandwich and a glass of beer. It was just enough to ruin his appetite – he says it doleful ly, though it's appar ent that food just now is the least of his worries. \"But\" – and he tries to make his voice sound more convinc ing – \"I was waiting for y ou all the ti me,\" he blurts out. \"Liar!\" she scream s. \"Liar! Ah, fortunat ely, I too am a liar... a good liar . You make me ill with your petty little lies. Why don't y ou tell me a big lie?\" He hangs his head again and absent - mindedly he gathers a few crumbs and puts them to his mouth. Whereupon she slaps his hand. \"Don't do that! You make me tired. You're such an imbecile. Liar! Just you wait! I have more to say. I am a liar too, but I am not an imbecile.\" In a little whil e, however , they are sitting close togeth er, their hands locked, and she is murmuring softly: \"Ah, m y little rabbi t, it is hard to leave you now. Come here, kiss me! What are you going to do this evening? Tell me the truth, my little one... I am sorry that I have such an ugl y temper.\" He kisses her timidly, just like a little bunn y with long pink ears; gives her a little peck on the lips as if he were nibbl ing a cabbage leaf. And at the same time his bright round eyes fall caressingly on her purse which is lying open beside her on the bench. He is only waiting for the moment when he can graciousl y give her the slip; he is itching to get away, to sit down in some quiet café on the Rue du Faubour g Montmartre. I know him, the innocent little devil, with his round, frighten ed eyes of a rabbit. And I know what a devil's street is the Faubou rg Mont martre with its brass plates and rubber goods, the lights twinkl ing all night and sex running through the street like a sewer. To walk from the Rue Lafayette to the boulevard is like running the gauntle t; they attach themselv es to you like barnac les, they eat into you like ants, they coax, wheedle, cajole, implore, beseech, they try it out in German, English, Spanish, they show you their torn hearts and their busted shoes, and long after you've chopped the tentacles away, long after the fizz and sizz le has died out, the fragran ce of the lavabo clings to your nostrils – it is the odor of the Parfum de Dan se whose effectiveness is guaran teed only for a distance of twent y centimeters. One could piss away a whole lifetime in that little stretch between the boulevard and the Rue Lafayette. Every bar is alive, throbbing, the"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"dice loaded ; the cashiers are perched like vultures on their high stools and the money they handl e has a human stink to it. There is no equiva lent in the Banque de France for the blood money that passes currenc y here, the money that glistens with human sweat, that passes like a forest fire from hand to hand and leaves behind it a smoke and stench. A man who can walk through the Faubour g Montmartre at night without panting or sweating, without a prayer or a curse on his lips, a man like that has no balls, and if he has, then he ought to be castr ated. Suppo sing the timid little rabbi t does spend fifty francs of an evening while waiting for his Lucienn e? Suppo sing he does get hungr y and buy a sandwich and a glass of beer, or stop and chat with somebody else's trollop? You think he ought to be weary of that round night after night? You think it ought to weigh on him, oppress him, bore him to death? You don't think that a pimp is inhum an, I hope? A pimp has his privat e grief and misery too, don't you forget. Perhaps he would like nothing better than to stand on the corner every night with a pair of white dogs and watch them piddle. Perhaps he would like it if, when he opened the door, he would see her there reading the Paris - Soir , her eyes already a little heavy with sleep. Perhap s it isn't so wonderfu l, when he bends over his Lucienne, to taste anoth er man's breath. Better maybe to have only three francs in your pocket and a pair of white dogs that piddle on the corner than to taste those bruised lips. Bet you, when she squeez es him tight, when she begs for that little packag e of love which only he knows how to deliver, bet you he fights like a thousand devils to pump it up, to wipe out that regiment that has marched between her legs. Maybe when he takes her body and practises a new tune, maybe it isn't all passion and curiosit y with him, but a fight in the dark, a fight single - handed against the army that rushed the gates, the army that walked over her, trampled her, that left her with such a devouring hunger that not even a Rudolph Valentino could appease. When I listen to the reproaches that are leveled against a girl like Lucienne, when I hear her being denigrated or despised because she is cold and mercenar y, because she is too mechanical, or because she's in too great a hurr y, or bec ause this or bec ause that, I say to m yself, hold on there bozo, not so fast! Remember that you're far back in the procession; remember that a whole army corps has laid siege to her, that she's been laid waste, plundered and pillaged. I say to myself, listen, bozo, don't begrudge the fifty francs you hand her because you know her pimp is pissing it away in the Faubour g Montm artre. It's her money and her pimp. It's blood money. It's money that'll never be taken out of circulation because there's nothing in the Banque de France to rede em it with. That's how I think about it often when I'm seated in my little niche juggling the Havas reports or untangl ing the cables from Chicago, London and Montreal. In between the rubber and silk markets and the Winnipeg grains there oozes a little of the fizz and sizzle of the Faubour g Mont martre. When the bonds go weak and spong y and the pivota ls balk and the volatiles effervesce, when the grain market slips and slides and the bulls commence to roar, when every fucking calamity, every ad, every sport item and fashion article, every boat arriva l, every travelogue, every tag of gossip has been punctuat ed, check ed, revised, pegged and wrung through the silver bracele ts, when I hear the front page being hammered into whack and see the frogs dancing around like drunken squibs, I think of Lucienne sailing down the boulevard with her wings outstretch ed, a huge silver condor suspended over the sluggish tide of traffic, a strange bird from the tips of the Andes with a rose - white belly and a tenacious little knob. Sometimes I walk home alone and I follow her through the dark streets, follow her through the court of the Louvre, over the Pont des Arts, through the arcade, through the"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"fents and slits, the somnolen ce, the drugged whiteness, the grill of the Luxembourg, the tangled boughs, the snores and groans, the green slats, the strum and t inkle, the points of the stars, the spangles, the jetties, the blue and white striped awnings that she brushed with the tips of her wings. In the blue of an electric dawn the peanut shells look wan and crum pled; along the beach at Montparnasse the water lilies bend and break. When the tide is on the ebb and only a few syphilitic mermaids are left stranded in the muck, the Dôme looks like a shooting gallery that's been struck by a cyclone. Everything is slowl y dribbling back to the sewer. For about an hour ther e is a deathl ike calm during which the vomit is mopped up. Suddenl y the trees begin to screech. From one end of the boulevard to the other a demented song rises up. It is like the signal that announces the close of the exchang e. What hopes there were are swept up. The moment has come to void the last bagful of urine. The day is sneaking in like a leper... One of the things to guard against when you work nights is not to break your schedule; if you don't get to bed before the birds begin to scree ch it's useless to go to bed at all. This morn ing, having nothing better to do, I visited the Jar din des Plan tes. Marvelous pelicans here from Chapult epec and peacocks with studded fans that look at you with sill y eyes. Suddenl y it began to rain. Returning to Montparnasse in the bus I noticed a little French woman opposite me who sat stiff and erect as if she were getting ready to preen herself. She sat on the edge of the seat as if she feared to crush her gorgeous tail. Marvelous, I though t, if suddenl y she shook herself and from her der rièr e there sprung open a huge studded fan with long silken plu mes. At the Café de l'Avenue, where I stop for a bite, a woman with a swollen stomach tries to interest me in her condit ion. She would like me to go to a room with her and while away an hour or two. It is the first time I have ever been propo sitioned by a pregnant woman: I am almost tempted to try it. As soon as the baby is born and handed over to the authori ties she will go back to her trade, she says. She makes hats. Observing that my interest is waning she takes my hand and puts it on her abdomen. I feel something stirring inside. It takes my appet ite away. I have never seen a place like Paris for varieties of sexual provende r. As soon as a woman loses a front tooth or an eye or a leg she goes on the loose. In America she'd starve to death if she had nothing to recommend her but a mutilation. Here it is different. A missing tooth or a nose eaten away or a fallen womb, any misfortune that aggravat es the natur al hom eliness of the female, see ms to be regarded as an added spice, a stimulant for the jaded appet ites of the m ale. I am speaking natur ally of that world which is pecul iar to the big cities, the world of men and women whose last drop of juice has been squeezed out by the machine – the martyrs of modern progress. It is this mass of bones and collar buttons which the painter finds s o difficult to put flesh on. It is only later, in the afternoon, when I find myself in an art galler y on the Rue de Sèze, surrounded by the men and women of Matisse, that I am drawn back again to the proper precincts of the human world. On the threshold of that big hall whose walls are now ablaze, I pause a moment to recov er from the shock which one exper iences when the habitual gray of the world is rent asunder and the color of life splashes forth in song"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"and poem . I find myself in a world so natur al, so complete, that I am lost. I have the sensation of being immersed in the very plexus of life, focal from whatever place, position or attitude I take my stanc e. Lost as when once I sank into the quick of a budding grove and seated in the dining room of that enor mous world of Balbe c, I caught for the first time the profound meaning of those interior stills which manifest their presence through the exorc ism of sight and touch. Stand ing on the threshold of that world which Matisse has created I re - exper ienced the power of that revela tion which had permitted Proust to so deform the picture of life that only those who, like himself, are sensible to the alche my of sound and sense, are capable of transform ing the nega tive reality of life into the substant ial and signific ant outlines of art. Only those who can admit the light into their gizzards can transla te what is there in the heart. Vividly now I recall how the glint and sparkl e of light caroming from the massive chandel iers splintered and ran blood, flecking the tips of the waves that beat monotonousl y on the dull gold outside the window s. On the beach, masts and chimneys interl aced, and like a fuliginous shadow the figure of Albertine gliding through the surf, fusing into the mysterious quick and prism of a protoplas mic realm, uniting her shadow to the dream and harbinger of death. With the close of day, pain rising like a mist from the earth, sorrow closing in, shuttering the endless vista of sea and sky. Two waxen hands lying listlessly on the bedspread and along the pale veins the fluted murmur of a shell repeat ing the legend of its birth. In every poem by Matisse there is the histor y of a particle of human flesh which refused th e consummation of death. The whole run of flesh, from hair to nails, expres ses the miracle of breathing, as if the inner eye, in its thirst for a greater reality, had converted the pores of the flesh into hungr y seeing mouths. By whatever vision one passes there is the odor and the sound of voyage. It is impossible to gaze at even a corner of his dreams without feeling the lift of the wave and the cool of flying spray. He stands at the helm peering with stead y blue eyes into the portfolio of time. Into what distant corners has he not thrown his long, slanting gaze? Looking down the vast prom ontor y of his nose he has beheld everything – the Cordil leras falling away into the Pacific, the histor y of the Diaspora done in vellum, shutters fluting the froufrou of the beach, the piano curving like a conch, coroll as giving out diapasons of light, chameleons squirming under the book press, seragl ios expir ing in oceans of dust, music issuing like fire from the hidden chrom osphere of pain, spore and madrepore fructifying the ear th, nave ls vom iting their bright spawn of anguish... He is a bright sage, a dancing seer who, with a sweep of the brush, removes the ugly scaffold to which the body of man is chained by the incontrov ertible facts of life. He it is, if any man today posse sses the gift, who knows where to dissolve the human figure, who has the courage to sacrific e an harmonious line in order to detec t the rythm and murmur of the blood, who takes the light that has been refrac ted inside him and lets it flood the keyboard of color. Behind the minutiae, the chaos, the mocker y of life, he detects the invisibl e pattern; he announces his discover ies in the metaphysical pigment of space. No searching for formulae, no crucif ixion of ideas, no compulsion other than to create. Even as the world goes to smash there is one man who remains at the core, who becomes more solidl y fixed and anchored, m ore centr ifugal as the process of dissolution quickens. More and more the world resem bles an entomolog ist's drea m. The earth is moving out of its orbit, the axis has shifted; from the north the snow blows down in huge knife - blue drifts.

At the very hub of this wheel which is falling apart, is Matisse. And he will keep on rolling until everything that has gone to make up the wheel has disint egrated. He has alread y rolled over a goodl y portion of the globe, over Persia and India and China, and like a magnet he has attached to himself microscopic particles from Kurd, Baluch istan, Timbuktu, Somaliland, Angkor , Tierra del Fuego. The odalisques he has studded with malachite and jasper , their flesh veiled with a thousand eyes, perfu med eyes dipped in the sperm of whales. Wherever a breeze stirs there are breasts as cool as jelly, white pigeons co me to flut ter and rut in the ice - blue veins of the Hi malayas. The wallpaper with which the men of science have covered the world of reality is falling to tatters. The grand whorehouse which they have made of life requires no decorat ion; it is essentia l only that the drains funct ion adequ ately. Beaut y, that feline beaut y which has us by the balls in America, is finished. To fatho m the new reality it is first necessar y to dismantle the drains, to lay open the gangrened ducts which compose the genito- urinar y system that supplies the excret a of art. The odor of the day is perm angan ate and form aldehyde. The drains are c logged with strangled e mbryos. The world of Matisse is still beautiful in an old - fashioned bedroo m way. There is not a ball bearing in eviden ce, nor a boiler plate, nor a piston, nor a monk ey wrench. It is the same old world that went gaily to the Bois in the pastoral days of wine and fornicat ion. I find it soothing and refreshing to move amongst these creatures with live, breathing pores whose background is stable and solid as light itself. I feel it poignantl y when I walk along the Boulevard de la Madelein e and the whores rustle beside me, when just to glance at them causes me to tremble. Is it because they are exotic or well- nourished ? No, it is rare to find a beaut iful woman along the Boulevard de la Madelein e. But in Matisse, in the explora tion of his brush, there is the trembling glitter of a world which demands only the presence of the female to crystallize the most fugitiv e aspirat ions. To come upon a woman offering herself outside a urinal, where there are advert ised cigare tte papers, rum, acrobats, horse rac es, where the heav y foliag e of the trees breaks the heav y mass of walls and roofs, is an experi ence that begins where the boundaries of the known world leave off. In the evening now and then, skirting the cemetery walls, I stumble upon the phanto m odalisques of Matisse fastened to the trees, their tangled manes drench ed with sap. A few feet away, removed by incalculab le eons of time, lies the prone and mummy - swathed ghost of Baudel aire, of a whole world that will belch no more. In the dusky corners of cafés are men and women with hands locked, their loins slather -flecked; nearb y stands the garçon with his apron full of sous, waiting patiently for the entr'ac te in order to fall upon his wife and gouge her. Even as the world falls apart the Paris that belongs to Matisse shudders with bright, gasping orgasms, the air itself is stead y with a stagnant sperm, the trees tangled like hair.

It is a strange document and I don't pretend to understand it all clearly. \"Wha t happened between us – at any rate, as far as I go – is that you touched me, touched my life, that is, at the one point where I am still alive: my death. By the emotional flow I went through anoth er immersion. I lived again, alive. No longer by reminiscence, as I do with others, but alive.\" That's how it began. Not a word of greeting, no date, no address. Written in a thin, pompous scrawl on ruled paper torn out of a blank book. \"That is why, whether you like me or not – deep down I rather think you hate me – you are very close to me. By you I know how I died: I see myself dying again : I am dying. That is something. More than to be dead simply. That may be the reason why I am so afraid to see you: you may have played the tri ck on m e, and died. Things happen so fast nowada ys.\" I'm reading it over, line by line, standing by the stones. It sound s nutty to me, all this palaver about life and death and things happening so fast. Nothing is happening that I can see, exc ept the usual calamities on the front page. He's been living all by himself for the last six months, tucked away in a cheap little room – probabl y holding telepath ic communication with Cronstadt. He talks about the line falling back, the sector evacua ted, and so on and so forth, as though he were dug into a trench and writing a report to headquart ers. He probabl y had his frock coat on when he sat down to pen this missive, and he probabl y rubbed his hands a few times as he used to do when a custom er was calling to rent the apartment. \"The reason I wanted you to commit suicide...\" he begins again. At that I burst out laugh ing. He used to walk up and down with one hand stuck in the tail flap of his frock coat at the Villa Borghese, or at Cronstadt's – wherev er there was deck space, as it were – and reel off this nonsense about living and dying to his heart's content. I never understood a word of it, I must confess, but it was a good show and, being a Gentil e, I was natura lly interested in what went on in that menagerie of a brainpan. Sometimes he would lie on his couch full length, exhausted by the surge of ideas that swept through his noodle. His feet just grazed the bookrack where he kept his Plato and Spinoz a – he couldn't understand wh y I had no use for them. I must say he made them sound interest ing, though what it was all about I hadn't the least idea. Sometimes I would glance at a volume furtively, to check up on these wild ideas which he imputed to them – but the connec tion was frail, tenuous. He had a language all his own, Boris, that is, when I had him alone; but when I listened to Cronstadt it seemed to me that Boris had plagiarized his wonderful ideas. They talked a sort of higher mathematics, these two. Nothing of flesh and blood ever crept in; it was weird, ghostl y, ghoulishl y abstra ct. When they got on to the dying business it sounded a little more concret e: after all, a cleaver or a meat ax has to have a handle. I enjoyed those sessions immensely. It was the first time in my life that death had even seemed fascinat ing to me – all these abstract deaths which involved a bloodless sort of agon y. Now and then they would compliment me on being alive, but in such a way that I felt embarrassed. They made me feel that I was alive in the nineteen th centur y, a sort of atavistic remnant, a romantic shred, a soulful Pithecan thropus erectus. Boris especia lly seemed to get a grea t kick out of touch ing m e; he wanted me to be aliv e so that he could die to his heart's content. You would think that all those millions in the street were nothing but dead cows the way he looked at me and touched me. But the letter... I'm forgetting the letter..."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"\"The reason why I wanted you to commit suicide that evening at the Cronstadts', when Moldorf became God, was that I was very close to you then. Perhaps closer than I shall ever be. And I was afraid, terribly afraid, that some day you'd go back on me, die on my hands. And I would be left high and dry with my idea of you simply, and nothing to sustain it. I should never forgive you for that.\" Perhaps you can visual ize him saying a thing like that! Myself it's not clear what his idea of me was, or at any rate, it's clear that I was just pure idea, an idea that kept itself alive without food. He never attached much impor tance, Boris, to the food proble m. He tried to nourish me with ideas. Everything was idea. Just the same, when he had his heart set on renting the apartment, he wouldn't forget to put a new washer in the toilet. Anyway, he didn't want me to die on his hands. \"You must be life for me to the very end,\" so he writes. \"That is the only way in which to sustain my idea of you. Because you have gotten, as you see, tied up with something so vital to me, I do not think I shall ever shake you off. Nor do I wish to. I want you to live more vitally every day, as I am dead. That is why, when I speak of you to others, I am just a bit ashamed. It's hard to talk of one' s self so intimately.\" You would imagine perhaps that he was anxious to see me, or that he would like to know what I was doing – but no, not a line about the concrete or the personal, excep t in this living - dying language, nothing but this little message from the trenches, this whiff of poison gas to apprise all and sundry that the war was still on. I sometimes ask myself how it happens that I attract nothing but crackbra ined individua ls, neurastheni cs, neurotics, psychopaths – and Jews especia lly. There must be something in a health y Gentile that excites the Jewish mind, like when he sees sour black bread. There was Moldorf, for example, who had made himself God, according to Boris and Cronstadt. He positively hated me, the little viper – yet he couldn't stay away from me. He came round regul arly for his little dose of insults – it was like a tonic to him. In the beginning, it's true, I was lenient with him; after all, he was paying me to listen to him. And though I never displa yed much sympathy I knew how to be sil ent when it invo lved a meal and a little pin money. After a while, however , seeing what a maso chist he was, I permitted myself to laugh in his face now and then; that was like a whip for him, it made the grief and agony gush forth with renewed vigor . And perhaps everything would have gone smoo thly between us if he had not felt it his duty to prote ct Tania. But Tania being a Jewess, that brought up a moral question. He wanted me to stick to Mlle. Claude for whom, I must admit, I had a genuin e affection. He even gave me money occasion ally to sleep with her. Until he rea lized that I was a hopeless leche r. I mention Tania now because she's just got back from Russia – just a few days ago. Sylvester remained behind to worm his way into a job. He's given up literature entirely. He's dedic ated himself to the new Utopi a. Tania wants me to go back there with her, to the Crimea preferabl y, and start a new life. We had a fine drink ing bout up in Carl's room the other day discu ssing the possibilities. I wanted to know what I could do for a living back there – if I could be a proofreader , for example. She said I didn't need to worry abou t what I would do – the y would find a job for me as long as I wa s earnest and sincere. I tried to look earnest, but I only succeeded in looking pathetic. They don't want to see sad faces in Russia; they want you to be cheerful, enthusiasti c, lightheart ed, optimistic. It sounded very much like Americ a to me. I wasn 't born with this kind of enthusias m. I didn't l et on to her, of course, but secret ly I was pra ying to be left alone, to go back to my little niche, and to stay there until the war breaks. All this hocus - pocus about Russia disturbed me a little. She got so excited about it, Tania, that we finished"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"almost a half dozen bottles of vin ordinair e. Carl was jumping about like a cockro ach. He has just enough Jew in him to lose his head over an idea like Russia. Nothing would do but to marry us off – immediately. \"Hitch up!\" he says, \"you have nothing to lose!\" And then he pretends to run a little errand so that we can pull off a fast one. And while she wanted it all right, Tania, still that Russia business had gotten so solidl y planted in her skull that she pissed the interva l away chewing my ear off, which made me somewha t grum py and ill at ease. Anyway, we had to think about eating and getting to the office, so we piled into a taxi on the Boulevard Edgar - Quinet, just a stone 's throw away from the cemetery, and off we whizzed. It was just a nice hour to spin through Paris in an open cab, and the wine rolling around in our tanks made it seem even more lovel y than usual. Carl was sitting opposite us, on the strapont in, his face as red as a beet. He was happy, the poor bastard, thinking what a glorious new life he would lead on the other side of Europe. And at the same time he felt a bit wistful, too – I could see that. He didn't really want to leave Paris, any more than I did. Paris hadn't been good to him, any more than it had to me, or to anybody, for that matter, but when you've suffered and endured things here it's then that Paris takes hold of you, grabs you by the balls, you might say, like some lovesick bitch who'd rather die than let you get out of her hands. That's how it looked to him, I could see that. Rolling over the Seine he had a big foolish grin on his face and he looked around at the build ings and the statues as though he were seeing them in'a dream. To me it was like a dream too: I had my hand in Tania's bosom and I was squeezing her titties with all my might and I noticed the water under the bridges and the barges and Notre - Dame down below , just like the post cards show it, and I was thinking drunkenl y to myself that's how one gets fucked, but I was sly about it too and I knew I wouldn't ever trade all this whirling about my head for Russia or heaven or anything on earth. It was a fine afternoon, I was thinking to myself, and soon we'd be pushing a feed down our bellies and what could we order as a specia l treat, some good heavy wine that would drown out all this Russia business. With a woman like Tania, full of sap and everything, they don't give a damn what happens to you once they get an idea in their heads. Let them go far enough and they'll pull the pants of f you, right in the t axi. It was grand though, m illing through the tr affic, our fac es all smudged with rouge and the wine gurgling like a sewer inside us, especia lly when we swung into the Rue Laffitte which is just wide enough to frame the little temple at the end of the street and above it the Sacré - Cœur , a kind of exotic jumble of archit ecture, a lucid French idea that gouges right through your drunkenness and leaves you swimming helplessl y in the past, in a fluid dream that makes you wide awake and yet doesn't jar y our nerves. With Tania back on the scene, a stead y job, the drunken talk about Russia, the walks home at night, and Paris in full summer, life seems to lift its head a little highe r. That's why perhaps, a letter such as Boris sent me seems absolut ely cocke yed. Most every day I meet Tania around five o'clock, to have a Porto with her, as she calls it. I let her take me to places I've never seen before, the swell bars around the Champs-E lysées where the sound of jazz and baby voices crooning seems to soak right through the mahogan y woodwork. Even when you go to the lavabo these pulpy, sappy strains pursue you, come floating into the cabin et through the ventilators and make life all soap and iridescen t bubbles. And whether it's because Sylvester is awa y and she feels free now, or whatever it is, Tania certainly tries to behave like an angel. \"You treated me lousy just before I went away,\" she says to me one day. \"Why did you want to act that way? I never did anything to hurt you, did I?\" We were getting sentimental, what with the soft"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"lights and that creamy, mahogan y music seeping through the place. It was getting near time to go to work and we hadn't eaten yet. The stubs were lying there in front of us – six francs, four - fifty, seven francs, two - fifty – I was counting them up mechanically and wonder ing too at the same time if I would like it better being a bartender . Often like that, when she was talking to me, gushing about Russia, the future, love, and all that crap, I'd get to thinking about the most irrelevan t things, about shining shoes or being a lavator y attendant, particu larly I suppose because it was so cosy in these joints that she dragged me to and it never occurred to me that I'd be stone sober and perhaps old and bent... no, I imagined always that the future, however modest, would be in just this sort of ambiance, with the same tunes playing through my head and the glasses clinking and behind every shapel y ass a trail of perfu me a yard wide that would take the stink out of life, even downstairs in th e lavabo. The strange thing is it never spoiled me trotting around to the swell bars with her like that. It was hard to le ave her , certa inly. I used to lead her around to the porch of a church near the office and standing ther e in the dark we'd take a last embrace, she whispering to me \"Jesus, what am I going to do now?\" She wanted me to quit the job so as I could make love night and day; she didn't even care about Russia any more, just so long as we were togeth er. But the moment I left her my head cleared. It was another kind of music, not so croon y but good just the same, which greeted my ears when I pushed through the swinging door. And another kind of perfu me, not just a yard wide, but omnipresent, a sort of sweat and patchouli that seem ed to come from the machines. Coming in with a skinfu l, as I usuall y did, it was like dropping suddenl y to a low altitude. General ly I made a beeline for the toilet – that braced me up rather. It was a little cooler there, or else the sound of water running made it seem so. It was always a cold douche, the toilet. It was real. Before you got inside you had to pass a line of French men peeling off their clothes. Ugh! but they stank, those devils! And they were well paid for it, too. But there they were, stripped down, some in long underwear , some with beards, most of them pale, skinny rats with lead in their veins. Inside the toilet you could take an inventor y of their idle thoughts. The walls were crowded with sketches and epithets, all of them jocosel y obscene, easy to understand, and on the whole rather jolly and sympathetic. It must have required a ladder to reach certain spots, but I suppo se it was worth while doing it even looking at it from just the psychological viewpoint. Sometimes, as I stood there taking a leak, I wondered what an impression it would make on those swell dames whom I observed passing in and out of the beau tiful lavatories on the Cham ps - Elysées. I wondered if the y would carr y their tails so high if they could see what was thought of an ass here. In their world, no doubt, everything was gauze and velve t – or they made you think so with the fine scents they gave out, swishing past you. Some of them hadn't always been such fine ladies either ; some of them swished up and down like that just to advertise their trade. And maybe, when they were left alone with themselves, when they talked out loud in the privac y of their boudoirs, maybe some strange things fell out of their mouths too; because in that world, just as in every world, the greater part of what happens is just muck and filth, sordid as any garbage can, only they are lucky enough to be able to put covers over the can. As I say, that afternoon life with Tania never had any bad effect upon me. Once in a while I'd get too much of a skinful and I'd have to stick my finger down my throat – because it's hard to read proof when you're not all there. It requires more concentr ation to detec t a missing comma than to epitomize Nietzsche's philosoph y. You can be brilliant sometimes, when you're drunk, but brilliance is out of place in the proofreading"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"depart ment. Dates, fractions, semicolons – these are the things that count. And these are the things that are most difficult to track down when your mind is all ablaze. Now and then I made some bad blunders, and if it weren't tha t I had learn ed how to kiss the boss's ass, I would have been fired, that's certain. I even got a letter one day from the big mogul upsta irs, a guy I never even met, so high up he was, and between a few sarcastic phrases about my more than ordinar y intelligence, he hinted pretty plainly that I'd better learn my place and toe the mark or there'd be what's what to pay. Frankl y, that scared the shit out of me. After that I never used a polysyllabic word in conversa tion; in fact, I hardl y ever opened my trap all night. I played the high - grade moron, which is what they wanted of us. Now and then, to sort of flatter the boss, I'd go up to him and ask politely what such and such a word might mean. He liked that. He was a sort of dictionar y and timetable, that guy. No matter how much beer he guzzl ed during the break – and he made his own priva te breaks too, seeing as how he was running the show – you could never trip him up on a date or a definition. He was born to the job. My only regre t was that I knew too much. It leaked out now and then, despit e all the precau tions I took. If I happened to come to work with a book under my arm this boss of ours would notice it, and if it were a good book it made him venom ous. But I never did anything intentional ly to displease him; I liked the job too well to put a noose around my neck. Just the same it's hard to talk to a man when you have nothing in common with him; you betra y yourself, even if you use only monosyllabic words. He knew goddam n well, the boss, that I didn't take the least bit of interest in his yarns; and yet, explain it how you will, it gave him pleasure to wean me away from my dreams and fill me full of dates and historica l events. It wa s his wa y of tak ing reveng e, I suppo se. The result was that I developed a bit of a neurosis. As soon as I hit the air I became extravag ant. It wouldn't matter what the subject of conversat ion happened to be, as we started back to Montparnasse in the early morning, I'd soon turn the fire hose on it, squelch it, in order to trot out my perver ted dreams. I liked best talking about those things which none of us knew anything about. I had cultivated a mild sort of insanit y, echola lia, I think it's called. All the tag ends of a night's proofing danced on the tip of my tongue. Dalmatia – I had held copy on an ad for that beautiful jeweled resort. All right, Dalmat ia. You take a train and in the morning your pores are perspiring and the grapes are bursting their skins. I could reel it off about Dalm atia from the grand boulevard to Cardina l Mazarin's palace, further , if I chose to. I don't even know where it is on the map, and I don't want to know ever, but at three in the morning with all that lead in your veins and your clothes satura ted with sweat and patchou li and the clink of bracel ets passing through the wringer and those beer yarns that I was braced for, little things like geograph y, costu me, speech, architecture don't mean a goddam n thing. Dalm atia belongs to a certain hour of the night when those high gongs are snuffed out and the court of the Louvre seems so wonderfull y ridiculous that you feel like weeping for no reason at all, just because it's so beautifully silent, so empty, so totally unlike the front page and the guys upstairs rolling the dice. With that little piece of Dalmatia resting on my throbbing nerves like a cold knife blade I could exper ience the most wonderfu l sensat ions of voyage. And the funny thing is again that I could travel all around the globe but America would never enter my mind; it was even further lost than a lost continent, because with the lost continents I felt some mysterious attachment, whereas with Amer ica I felt nothing at all. Now and then, it's true, I did think of Mona, not as of a person in a defini te aura of time and space, but separat ely, detached, as though she had blown up into a great cloudl ike form that blotted out the past. I couldn't"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"allow myself to think about her very long; if I had I would have jumped off the bridge. It's strange. I had become so reconc iled to this life without her, and yet if I though t about her only for a minute it was enough to pierce the bone and marrow of my content ment and shove m e back again into the agoni zing gut ter of m y wretched past. For seven years I went about, day and night, with only one thing on my mind – her. Were there a Christian so faithful to his God as I was to her we would all be Jesus Christs today. Day and night I though t of her, even when I was deceiving her. And now sometimes, in the very midst of things, sometimes when I feel that I am absolutely free of it all, suddenl y, in rounding a corner perhaps, there will bob up a little square, a few trees and a bench, a deserted spot where we stood and had it out, where we drove each other crazy with bitter, jealous scenes. Alwa ys some deserted spot, like the Place de 1'Estrapade, for exam ple, or those dingy, mournful streets off the Mosque or along that open tomb of an Avenue de Breteu il which at ten o'clock in the evening is so silent, so dead, that it makes one think of murder or suicid e, anything that might create a vestige of human drama. When I realize that she is gone, perhaps gone forever , a great void opens up and I feel that I am falling, falling, falling into deep, black space. And this is worse than tears, deeper than regre t or pain or sorrow; it is the abyss into which Satan was plunged. There is no climbing back, no ray of light, no sound of human voice or human touch of hand. How many thousand times, in walking through the streets at night, have I wondered if the da y would ever co me again when she would be at m y side: al l those yearning looks I bestowed on the buildings and statues, I had looked at them so hungril y, so despera tely, that by now my thoughts must have become a part of the very build ings and statues, they must be saturat ed with my anguish. I could not help but reflec t also that when we had walked side by side through these mournful, dingy streets now so saturated with my dream and longing, she had observed nothing, felt nothing: they were like any other streets to her, a little more sordid perhaps, and that is all. She wouldn't remember that at a certain corner I had stopped to pick up her hairpin, or that, when I bent down to tie her laces, I remarked the spot on which her foot had rested and that it would remain there forever , even after the cathedra ls had been demolished and the whole Latin civilization wiped out forever and eve r. Walking down the Rue Lhom ond one night in a fit of unusual anguish and desola tion, certain things were revea led to me with poignant clarity. Wheth er it was that I had so often walked this street in bitterness and despair or whether it was the remembrance of a phrase which she had dropped one night as we stood at the Place Lucien - Herr I do not know . \"Why don't you show me that Paris,\" she said, \"that you have written about?\" One thing I know , that at the recollection of these word s I suddenl y realized the impossibil ity of ever revea ling to her that Paris which I had gotten to know, the Paris whose arrondis sements are undefin ed, a Paris that has never existed excep t by virtue of my loneliness, my hunger for her. Such a huge Paris! It would take a lifetime to explore it again. This Paris, to which I alone had the key, hardl y lends itself to a tour, even with the best of intent ions; it is a Paris that has to be lived, that has to be experien ced each day in a thousand different forms of torture, a Paris that grows inside you like a cancer, and grow s and grows until you are ea ten away by it. Stum bling down the Rue Mouf fetard, with these reflect ions stirring in my brain, I recalled ano ther strange item out of the past, out of that guid ebook who se leaves she had asked me to turn but which, because the covers were so heavy, I then found impossible"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"to pry open. For no reason at all – because at the moment my thoughts were occupied with Salavin in whose sacred precinc ts I was now meandering – for no reason at all, I say, there came to mind the recollection of a day when, inspired by the plaqu e which I passed day in and day out, I impulsive ly entered the Pension Orfila and asked to see the room Strindber g had occupied. Up to that time nothing very terrib le had befall en me, though I had alread y lost all my worldly posses sions and had known what it was to walk the streets in hunger and in fear of the police. Up to then I had not found a single friend in Paris, a cir cumstan ce which was not so m uch depressing as bewildering, for wherever I have roamed in this world the easiest thing for me to discover has been a friend. But in reality, nothing very terrib le had happened to me yet. One can live without friends, as one can live withou t love, or even without money, that supposed sine qua non. One can live in Paris – I discovered that! – on just grief and anguish. A bitter nourishm ent – perhaps the best there is for certain people. At any rate, I had not yet come to the end of my rope. I was only flirting with disaste r. I had time and sentiment enough to spare to peep into other people's lives, to dally with the dead stuff of romance which, however morbid it may be, when it is wrapped between the covers of a book, seems deliciousl y remote and anonymous. As I was leaving the place I was conscious of an ironic smile hovering over my lips, as though I were saying to m yself \"Not y et, the Pension Orfila!\" Since then, of course, I have learned what every madman in Paris discovers sooner or later; that ther e are no read y-made infernos for the torm ented. It seems to me I understand a little better now why she took such huge delight in reading Strindber g. I can see her looking up from her book after reading a delic ious passage, and, with tears of laughter in her eyes, saying to me: \"You're just as mad as he was... you want to be punished!\" What a deligh t that must be to the sadist when she discovers her own proper masochist! When she bites herself, as it were, to test the sharpness of her teeth. In those days, when I first knew her, she was saturat ed with Strindber g. That wild carniva l of maggots which he reveled in, that eterna l duel of the sexes, that spider ish feroc ity which had endeared him to the sodden oafs of the northland, it was that which had brought us together. We came together in a dance of death and so quickl y was I sucked down into the vortex that when I came to the surface again I could not recognize the world. When I found myself loose the music had ceased; the carn ival was over and I had been picked c lean... After leaving the Pension Orfila that afternoon I went to the library and there, after bathing in the Gange s and pondering over the signs of the zodiac, I began to reflect on the meaning of that inferno which Strindber g had so mercilessly depic ted. And, as I ruminated, it began to grow clear to me, the mystery of his pilgri mage, the flight which the poet makes over the face of the earth and then, as if he had been ordained to re - enact a lost drama, the heroic descent to the very bowels of the earth, the dark and fearsom e sojourn in the belly of the whale, the blood y struggle to liberate himself, to emerge clean of the past, a bright, gory sun god cast up on an alien shore. It was no mystery to me any longer why he and others (Dante, Rabel ais, Van Gogh, etc., etc.) had made their pilgri mage to Paris. I understood then why it is that Paris attrac ts the tortured, the halluc inated, the great maniacs of love. I understood why it is that here, at the very hub of the wheel, one can embra ce the most fantast ic, the most impossible theor ies, withou t finding them in the least strange; it is here that one reads again the books of his youth and the enigmas take on new meanings, one for every white hair. One walks the streets knowing that he is mad, possessed, because it is only too obvious that these cold, indifferen t faces are the visages of one's keepers. Here all boundaries fade away and the"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"world reveals itself for the mad slaughterhouse that it is. The treadmill stretches away to infini tude, the hatch es are closed down tight, logic runs rampan t, with blood y cleav er flashing. The air is chill and stagnant, the langu age apocalyptic. Not an exit sign anywher e; no is sue save death. A blind alley at the end of which is a scaffold. An eternal city, Paris! More eternal than Rome, more splendorous than Nineveh. The very navel of the world to which, like a blind and faltering idiot, one crawls back on hands and knees. And like a cork that has drifted to the dead center of the ocean, one floats here in the scum and wrack of the seas, listless, hopeless, heedless even of a passing Colum bus.

One passes along a street on a wintr y day and, seeing a dog for sale, one is moved to tears. While across the way, cheerfu l as a cemetery, stands a miserab le hut that calls itself \"Hôtel du Tombeau des Lapins.\" That makes one laugh, laugh fit to die. Until one notices that there are hotels everywhere, for rabbits, dogs, lice, emperors, cabine t ministers, pawnbrokers, horse knackers, and so on. And almost every other one is an \"Hôtel de l'Avenir.\" Which makes one more hysterical still. So many hotels of the future! No hotels in the past participle, no subjunctive modes, no conjunctivitis. Everything is hoary, grisly, bristl ing with merriment, swollen with the future, like a gumboi l. Drunk with this lecherous eczema of the future, I stagger over to the Place Violet, the colors all mauve and slate, the doorwa ys so low that only dwarfs and goblins could hobbl e in; over the dull craniu m of Zola the chimneys are belching pure coke, while the Madonna of Sandwiches listens with cabbage ears to the bubbling of the gas tanks, those beautifu l bloa ted to ads w hich squat b y the roadside. Why do I suddenl y recollect the Passage des Thermopyles? Because that day a woman addressed her pupp y in the apocalyptic langu age of the slaughterhouse, and the little bitch, she understood what this greas y slut of a midwif e was saying. How that depressed me! More even than the sight of those whimpering curs that were being sold on the Rue Brandon, because it was not the dogs which filled me so with pity, but the huge iron railing, those rusty spikes which seemed to stand betwe en me and my rightfu l life. In the pleasant little lane near the Abattoir de Vaugirard (Abattoir Hippophagique), which is called the Rue des Périch aux, I had noticed here and there signs of blood. Just as Strindber g in his madness had recogni zed omens and portents in the very flagging of the Pension Orfila, so, as I wandered aimlessly through this muddy lane bespatt ered with blood, fragments of the past detached themselves and floated listlessly before my eyes, taunting me with the direst forebodings. I saw my own blood being spilled, the muddy road stained with it, as far back as I could remember, from the very beginn ing doubtless. One is ejected into the world like a dirty little mummy; the roads are slipper y with blood and no one knows why it should be so. Each one is travel ing his own way and, though the earth be rotting with good things, there is no time to pluck the fruits; the procession scram bles toward the exit sign, and such a panic is there, such a sweat to escape, that the weak and the helpless are trampled into the mud and their cries are unheard.

And, only a few days later, I stood on the platfor m of the Gare St. Lazar e and I watch ed the train pull out, the train that was bearing her away: she was leaning out of the window , just as she had leaned out of the windo w when I left her in New York, and there was that same, sad, inscrutabl e smile on her face, that last - minute look which is intend ed to conve y so much, but which is only a mask that is twisted by a vacant smile. Only a few days before, she had clung to me desperat ely and then something happened, something which is not even clear to me now, and of her own volition she boarded the train and she was looking at me again with that sad, enigmatic smile which baffles me, which is unjust, unnatural, which I distrust with all my soul.

One of them was a retired fur merchant who had an itch to see his name in the papers; he proposed that I write a series of articles under his name for a Jewish daily in New York. I had to scout around the Dôme and the Coupole searching for prominent Jews. The first man I picked on was a celebr ated mathematician; he couldn't speak a word of English. I had to write about the theor y of shock from the diagra ms he left on the paper napkins; I had to describe the movements of the astral bodies and demolish the Einsteini an concept ion at the same time. All for twent y - five francs. When I saw m y articles in the newspaper I couldn't read them; but they looked impressive, just the same, especia lly with the pseudon ym of the fur me rchan t attached. I did a lo t of pseudon ymous writing during this period. When the big new whorehouse opened up on the Boulevard Edgar - Quinet, I got a little rake - off, for writing the"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"pamphlets. That is to say, a bottle of cham pagne and a free fuck in one of the Egyptian rooms. If I succeed ed in bringing a client I was to get my commission, just like Kepi got his in the old days. One night I brought Van Norden; he was going to let me earn a little money by enjoying himself upstairs. But when the madame learned that he was a newspaper man she wouldn't hear of taking money from him; it was a bottle of champagn e again and a free fuck. I got nothing out of it. As a matter of fact, I had to write the story for him because he couldn't think how to get round the subject withou t mentioning the kind of place it was. One thing after another like that. I was getting fucked good and proper . The worst job of all was a thesis I undertook to write for a deaf and dumb psychologist. A treatise on the care of crippled children. My head was full of diseases and braces and workbenches and fresh air theori es; it took about six weeks off and on, and then, to rub it in, I had to proofread the goddam ned thing. It was in French, such a French as I've never in my life seen or heard. But it brought me in a good breakfast every day, an American breakf ast, with orange juice, oatmeal, cream, coffee, now and then ham and eggs for a chang e. It was the only period of my Paris days that I ever indulged in a decent breakf ast, thanks to the cripp led children of Rockawa y Beach, the East Side, and all the coves and inle ts bordering on these sore points. Then one day I fell in with a photographer; he was making a collection of the slimy joints of Paris for some degen erate in Munich. He wanted to know if I would pose for him with my pants down, and in other ways. I thought of those skinn y little runts, who look like bell - hops and messeng er boys, that one sees on pornographic post cards in little bookshop windows occasion ally, the mysterious phanto ms who inhabi t the Rue de la Lune and other malodorous quarters of the city. I didn't like very much the idea of advertising my physiog in the company of these élite. But, since I was assured that the photographs were for a strictly priva te collection, and since it was destined for Munich, I gave my consent. When you're not in your home town you can perm it yourself little liberties, particu larly for such a worth y motive as earning your daily bread. After all, I hadn't been so squeamish, come to think of it, even in New York. There were nights when I was so damned despera te, back there, that I had to go out right in my own neighbourhood and panhandle. We didn't go to the show places familiar to the tourists, but to the little joints where the atmosphere was more congenia l, where we could play a game of cards in the afternoon before getting down to work. He was a good companion, the photographer . He knew the city inside out, the walls particularl y; he talked to me about Goethe often, and the days of the Hohenstaufen, and the massacr e of the Jews during the reign of the Black Death. Interest ing subjects, and always related in some obscure way to the things he was doing. He had ideas for scenarios too, astounding ideas, but nobod y had the courage to execut e them. The sight of a horse, split open like a saloon door, would inspire him to talk of Dante or Leon ardo da Vinci or Rembrandt ; from the slaughterhouse at Villette he would jump into a cab and rush me to the Trocad ero Museum, in order to point out a skull or a mummy that had fascina ted him. We explor ed the 5th, the 13th, the 19th and the 20th arrondis sements thoroughl y. Our favori te resting places were lugubrious little spots such as the Place Nation ale, Place des Peupliers, Place de la Contr escarpe, Place Paul- Verlaine. Many of these places were alread y familiar to me, but all of them I now saw in a different light owing to the rare flavor of his conversation. If today I should happen to stroll down the Rue du Château-des- Rentiers, for exam ple, inhaling the fetid stench of the hospital beds with which the 13th"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"arrondis sement reeks, my nostrils would undoubtedl y expand with pleasure, because, compounded with that odor of stale piss and formaldeh yde, there would be the odors of our imaginativ e voyages through the charn el house of Europe which the Black Death had crea ted. Through him I got to know a spiritual - minded individua l named Kruger , who was a sculptor and painte r. Kruger took a shine to me for some reason or other; it was impossible to get away from him once he discovered that I was willing to listen to his \"esoteric\" ideas. There are people in this world for whom the word \"esoter ic\" seems to act as a divine ichor. Like \"settled\" for Herr Peeperkorn of the Magic Mounta in. Kruger was one of those saints who have gone wrong, a masoch ist, an anal type whose law is scrupulousnes s, rectitude and consci entiousness, who on an off day would knock a man's teeth down his throat without a qualm. He seem ed to think I was ripe to move on to another plane, \"a higher plane,\" as he put it. I was ready to move on to any plane he designated, provided that one didn't eat less or drink less. He chewed my head off about the \"threadsoul\", the \"causa l body,\" \"ablation,\" the Upanishads, Plotinus, Krishna murti, \"the Karm ic vestiture of the soul,\" \"the nirvani c consciousnes s,\" all that flapdoodle which blows out of the East like a breath from the plague. Sometimes he would go into a trance and talk about his previous incarna tions, how he imagined them to be, at least. Or he would relate his dreams which, so far as I could see, were thoroughl y insipid, prosaic, hardl y worth even the attention of a Freudian, but, for him, there were vast esoteric marvels hidden in their depths which I had to aid him to decipher. He had turned hi mself inside out, lik e a coa t whose nap is worn of f. Little by little, as I gained his confid ence, I wormed my way into his heart. I had him at such a point that he would come running after me, in the street, to inquire if he could lend me a few francs. He wanted to hold me togeth er in order to survive the transit ion to a higher plane. I acted like a pear that is ripen ing on the tree. Now and then I had relapses and I would confess my need for more earthl y nourishm ent – a visit to the Sphinx or the Rue St. Apolline where I knew he repaired in weak moments when the demands of the flesh had beco me too vehe ment. As a painter he was nil; as a sculptor less than nil. He was a good housekeeper , that I'll say for him. And an econo mical one to boot. Nothing went to waste, not even the paper that the meat was wrapped in. Friday nights he threw open his studio to his fellow artists; there was always plenty to drink and good sandwiches, and if by chance there was anything lef t over I would co me round the next da y to polish i t off. Back of the Bal Bullier was anoth er studio I got into the habit of frequent ing – the studio of Mark Swift. If he was not a genius he was certainly an eccentr ic, this caustic Irishm an. He had for a model a Jewess whom he had been living with for years; he was now tired of her and was search ing for a pretext to get rid of her. But as he had eaten up the dowr y which she had origina lly brought with her, he was puzzled as to how to disem barrass himself of her withou t making restitu tion. The simplest thing was to so antagoni ze her that she would choo se starvation rather than support his crue lties. She was rather a fine person, his mistress; the worst that one could say against her was that she had lost her shape, and her ability to support him any longe r. She was a painter herself and, among those who professed to know , it was said that she had far more talent than he. But no matter how miserable he made life for her she was just; she would never al low an yone to say that he wa s not a great painte r. It was bec ause he rea lly has genius, she said, that he was such a rotten individu al. One never saw her canvases"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"on the wall – only his. Her things were stuck away in the kitchen. Once it happened, in my presence, that someone insisted on seeing her work. The result was painful. \"You see this figure,\" said Swift, point ing to one of her canvases with his big foot. \"The man standing in the doorway there is just about to go out for a leak. He won't be able to find his wa y back because his head is on wrong... No w tak e that nude over there... It was all right until she started to paint the cunt. I don't know what she was think ing about, but she made it so big tha t her brush slipped and she couldn't get it out again.\" By way of showing us what a nude ought to be like he hauls out a huge canvas which he had recently completed. It was a picture of her, a splend id piece of vengeance inspired by a guilty conscience. The work of a madman – vicious, petty, malign, brilliant. You had the feeling that he had spied on her through the keyhole, that he had caught her in an off moment, when she was picking her nose absent - mindedly, or scratching her ass. She sat there on the horsehair sofa, in a room without ventilation, an enorm ous room withou t a window; it might as well have been the anterior lobe of the pineal gland. Back of her ran the zigzag stairs leading to the balcon y; they were covered with a bilious - green carpet, such a green as could only emanate from a universe that had been pooped out. The most prominen t thing was her buttocks, which were lopsided and full of scabs; she seemed to have slightl y raised her ass from the sofa, as if to let a loud fart. Her face he had idealized: it looked sweet and virginal, pure as a cough drop. But her bosom was distended, swollen with sewer gas; she seemed to be swim ming in a menstrual sea, an enl arged fetus with the dul l, syrupy look of an ange l. Neverthel ess one couldn't help but like him. He was an indefat igable worker , a man who hadn't a single thought in his head but paint. And cunning as a lynx withal. It was he who put it into my head to cultiv ate the friendship of Fillmore, a young man in the diplo matic service who had found his way into the little group that surrounded Kruger and Swift. \"Le t him help y ou,\" he said. \"He doesn 't know what to do with his m oney.\" When one spends what he has on himself, when one has a thoroughl y good time with his own money, peopl e are apt to say \"he doesn 't know what to do with his money.\" For my part, I don't see any better use to which one can put money. About such individu als one can't say that they're generous or sting y. They put money into circula tion – that's the principa l thing. Fillmore knew that his days in France were limited; he was determined to enjoy them. And as one always enjoys himself better in the company of a friend it was only natural that he should turn to one like myself, who had plent y of time on his hands, for that companionship which he needed. People said he was a bore, and so he was, I suppose, but when you're in need of food you can put up with worse things than being bored. After all, despit e the fact that he talked incessantl y, and usuall y about himself or the authors whom he admired slavishly – such birds as Anatole France and Joseph Conrad – he neverthe less made my nights interesting in other ways. He liked to dance, he liked good wines, and he liked women. That he liked Byron also, and Victor Hugo, one could forgive; he was only a few years out of college and he had plent y of time ahead of him to be cured of such tastes. What he had that I liked was a sense of adventure. We got even better acquain ted, more intimate, I might say, due to a peculiar incident that occurred during my brief sojourn with Kruger . It happened just after the arrival of Collins, a sailor whom Fillmore had got to know on the way over from Amer ica. The three of us used to meet regularl y on the terrasse of the Rotond e before going to dinne r. It was always Pernod, a drink which put Collins in good humor and provided a base, as"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"it were, for the wine and beer and fines, etc., which had to be guzzled afterward. All during Collins's sta y in Paris I lived like a duke; noth ing but fowl and good vint ages and desserts that I hadn't even heard of before. A month of this regimen and I should have been obliged to go to Baden - Baden or Vichy or Aix - les - Bains. Meanwhi le Kruger was putting me up at his studio. I was getting to be a nuisance because I never showed up before three a.m. and it was difficult to rout me out of bed before noon. Overtl y Kruger never uttered a word of reproa ch but his manner indicated plainly enough that I was becoming a bum. One day I was taken ill. The rich diet was taking effect upon me. I don't know what ailed me, but I couldn't get out of bed. I had lost all my stamina, and with it whatever courage I possessed. Kruger had. to look after m e, had to make broths for m e, and so on. It was a trying period for him, more particularly because he was just on the verge of giving an importan t exhibi tion at his studio, a privat e showing to some wealthy connoisseurs from whom he was expect ing aid. The cot on which I lay was in the studio; th ere was no other roo m to put m e in. The morning of the day he was to give his exhibit ion, Kruger awoke thoroughl y disgruntled. If I had been able to stand on my feet I know he would have given me a clout in the jaw and kicked me out. But I was prostrate, and weak as a cat. He tried to coax me out of bed, with the idea of locking me up in the kitchen upon the arriva l of his visitors. I realized that I was making a mess of it for him. People can't look at pictures and statues with enthusias m when a man is dying before their eyes. Kruger honestl y thought I was dying. So did I. That's why, despite my feelings of guilt, I couldn't muster any enthusias m when he proposed calling for the ambul ance and having me shipped to the American Hospital. I wanted to die there, comfortab ly, right in the studio; I didn't want to be urged to get up and find a better place to die in. I didn't care where I died, really, so long as it wasn't nec essary to get up. When he heard me talk this way Kruger became alarmed. Worse than having a sick man in his studio should the visitors arrive, was to have a dead man. That would completely ruin his prospects, slim as they were. He didn't put it that way to me, of course, but I could see from his agitation that that was what worried him. And tha t made me stubborn. I refused to let him call the hospita l. I refused to let him call a doctor . I refused ever ything. He got so angry with me finally that, despite my protest ations, he began to dress me. I was too weak to resist. All I could do was to murmur weakl y – \"you bastard you!\" Though it was warm outdoors I was shiver ing like a dog. After he had completely dressed me he flung an overcoat over me and slipped outside to telephon e. \"I won 't go! I won't go!\" I kept saying but he simply slammed the door on me. He came back in a few minutes and, without addressing a word to me, busied himself about the studio. Last minute preparations. In a little while there was a knock on the door. It was Fillmore. Collins was waiting down stairs, he infor med me. The two of them, Fillmore and Kruger , slipped their arms under me and hoisted me to my feet. As they dragged me to the elevator Kruger soften ed up. \"It's for your own good,\" he said. \"And besides, it wouldn't be fair to me. You know what a struggl e I've had all these years. You ought to think about me too.\" He was actua lly on the point of tears. Wretched and miserable as I felt, his words almost made me smile. He was considerabl y older than I, and even though he was a rotten painter , a rotten artist all the"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"way through, he deserved a break – a t least once in a life time. \"I don 't hold it against you,\" I mu ttered. \"I understand how it is.\" \"You know I always liked you,\" he responded. \"When you get better you can come back here again... you can sta y as long as you like.\" \"Sure, I kno w... I' m not going to croak yet,\" I ma naged to get out. Somehow , when I sa w Col lins down below m y spiri ts revived. If ever an y one seemed to be thorough ly alive, healthy, joyous, magnani mous, it was he. He picked me up as if I were a doll and laid me out on the seat of the cab – gently too, which I apprecia ted after the wa y Kruger had m anhandled me. When we drove up to the hotel – the hotel that Collins was stopping at – there was a bit of a discussion with th e proprietor , during which I lay stretched out on the sofa in the bureau. I could hear Collins saying to the pat ron that it was nothing... just a little breakdown... be all right in a few days. I saw him put a crisp bil l in the man's hands and then, turning swiftl y and lithely, he came back to where I was and said: \"Come on, buck up! Don't let him think you're croaking.\" And with that, he yanked me to my feet and, bracing me with one arm , escort ed me to the eleva tor. Don' t let him think you' re croaking! Obviousl y it was bad taste to die on people's hands. One should die in the bosom of his family, in privat e, as it were. His words were encouraging. I began to see it all as a bad joke. Upstairs, with the door closed, they undres sed me and put me betwe en the sheets. \"You can't die now, godda mn it!\" said Collins warmly. \"You'll put me in a hole... Besides, what the hell's the matter with you? Can't stand good living? Keep your chin up! You'll be eating a porterhouse steak in a day or two. You think you're ill! Wait, by Jesus until you get a dose of syphilis! That's something to make you worry...\" And he began to relate, in a humorous way, his trip down the Yangtze Kiang, with hair falling out and teeth rotting away. In the feeble state that I was in, the yarn that he spun had an extr aordinar y soothing effect upon me. It took me completely out of myself. He had guts, this guy. Perhaps he put it on a bit thick, for my benefi t, but I wasn't listening to him critically at the moment. I was all ears and eyes. I saw the dirty yellow m outh of the river , the lights going up at Hankow , the sea of yellow faces, the sampans shooting down through the gorges and the rapids flaming with the sulfurous breath of the dragon. What a story! The coolies swarm ing around the boat each day, dredging for the garbage that was flung overboard, Tom Slattery rising up on his deathbed to take a last look at the lights of Hankow , the beautiful Eurasian who lay in a dark room and filled his veins with poison, the monoton y of blue jackets and yellow faces, millions and millions of them hollowed out by famine, ravaged by disease, subsisting on rats and dogs and roots, chewing the grass off the earth, devouring their own children. It was hard to imagine that this man's body had once been a mass of sores, that he had been shunned like a leper; his voice was so quiet and gentle, it was as though his spirit had been cleansed by all the suffering he had endured. As he reach ed for his drink his face grew more and more soft and his words actua lly seemed to caress me. And all the while China hanging over us like Fate itself. A China rotting away, crum bling to dust like a huge dinosaur , yet preserving to the very end the glamor, the enchant ment, the m ystery, the cruelt y of her hoar y legends. I could no longer follow his stor y; my mind had slipped back to a Fourth of July when I bought my first package of firecra ckers and with it the long pieces of punk which break so easily, the punk that you blow on to get a good red glow, the punk whose smell stick to your fingers for da ys and m akes you dream of strange things. The Fourth of July"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"the streets are littered with bright red paper stamped with black and gold figures and everywhere there are tiny firecrack ers which have the most curious intestin es; packag es and packag es of them, all strung together by their thin, flat, little gutstrings, the color of human brains. All day long there is the smell of powder and punk and the gold dust from the bright red wrappers sticks to your fingers. One never thinks of China, but it is there all the time on the tips of your fingers and it makes your nose itchy; and long afterwards, when you have forgotten almost what a firecra cker smells like, you wake up one day with gold leaf choking you and the broken pieces of punk waft back their pungent odor and the bright red wrappers give you a nostalgia for a peopl e and a soil you have never known, but which is in your blood, mysteriousl y there in your blood, like the sense of time or space, a fugitive, constan t value to which you turn more and more as you get old, which you try to seize with your mind, but ineffectually, because in everything Chinese there is wisdom and mystery and you can never grasp it with two hands or with your mind but you must let it rub off, let it stick to your fingers, let it slowly infiltrate your veins. A few weeks later, upon receipt of a pressing invita tion from Collins who had returned to Le Havre, Fillmore and I boarded the train one morning, prepared to spend the weekend with him. It was the first time I had been outside of Paris since my arriva l here. We were in fine fettle, drinking Anjou all the way to the coast. Collins had given us the address of a bar where we were to meet; it was a place called Jimmie's Bar, which everyone in Le Havre was supposed to know . We got into an open barouche at the station and started on a brisk trot for the rendezvous; there was still a half bottle of Anjou left which we polished off as we rode along. Le Havre looked gay, sunny; the air was bracing, with that strong salty tang which almost made me homesick for New York. There were masts and hulls cropping up everywhere, brigh t bits of bunt ing, big open squares and high - ceilinged cafés such as one only sees in the provinces. A fine impression immediately; the city was welco ming us with open ar ms. Before we ever reached the bar we saw Collins coming down the street on a trot, heading for the station, no doubt, and a little late as usual. Fillmore immediately suggested a Pernod; we were all slapping each other on the back, laughing and spitting, drunk already from the sunshine and the salt sea air. Collins seemed undecided about the Pernod at first. He had a little dose of clap, he inform ed us. Nothing very serious – \"a strain\" most likely. He showed us a bottle he had in his pocke t – \"Vénét ienne\" it was called, if I rem ember rightl y. The sai lors' remedy for cl ap. We stopped off at a restauran t to have a little snack before repairing to Jimmie's place. It was a huge tavern with big, smoky rafters and tables creaking with food. We drank copiousl y of the wines that Collins recommended. Then we sat down on a terrasse and had coffee and liqueurs. Collins was talking about the Baron de Charlus, a man after his own heart, he said. For almost a year now he had been staying at Le Havre, going through the money that he had accu mulated during his bootl egging days. His tastes were simple – food, drink, wom en and book s. And a private bath! That he insisted on. We were still talking about the Baron de Charlus when we arrived at Jimmie's Bar. It was late in the afternoon and the place was just beginn ing to fill up. Jimmie was there, his face red as a beet, and beside him was his spouse, a fine buxo m Frenchwom an with"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"glittering eyes. We were given a marvelous reception all around. There were Pernod s in front of us again, the gra mophon e was s hriek ing, peopl e were jabbering awa y in English and French and Dutch and Norwegian and Spanish, and Jimmie and his wife, both of them looking very brisk and dapper , were slapping and kissing each other heartily and raising their glasses and clinking them – altogether such a bubbl e and blabb er of merriment that you felt like pulling off your clothes and doing a war dance. The women at the bar had gathered around like flies. If we were friends of Collins that meant we were rich. It didn't matter that we had come in our old clothes; all Angla is dressed like that. I hadn't a sou in my pocket, which didn't matter, of course, since I was the guest of honour . Neverthe less I felt somewha t embarrassed with two stunning - looking whores hanging on my arms waiting for me to order something. I decid ed to take the bull by the horns. You couldn't tell any more which drinks were on the house and which were to be paid for . I had to be a gentleman, even if I didn't have a sou in my pocket. Yvette – that was Jimmie's wife – was extraordinar ily gracious and friend ly with us. She was prepar ing a little spread in our honor . It would take a little while yet. We were not to get too drunk – she wanted us to enjoy the meal. The gram ophone was going like wild and Fil lmore had begun to dance with a beau tiful mulatto who had on a tight velve t dress that revealed all her charms. Collins slipped over to my side and whispered a few words about the girl at my side. \"The madame will invite her to dinner ,\" he said, \"if you'd like to have her.\" She was an ex - whore who owned a beaut iful home on the outskirts of the city. The mistress of a sea capta in now. He was away and there was nothing to fear. \"If she likes y ou she'll inv ite you to sta y with her,\" he added. That was enough for me. I turned at once to Marcel le and began to flatter the ass off her. We stood at the corner of the bar, pretending to dance, and mauled each other ferociousl y. Jimmie gave me a big horse - wink and nodded his head approving ly. She was a lascivious bitch, this Marcel le, and pleasant at the same time. She soon got rid of the other girl, I noticed, and then we settled down for a long and intimate conversa tion which was interrupt ed unfortuna tely by the announce ment that dinner was read y. There were about twent y of us at the table, and Marcel le and I were placed at one end opposite Jimmie and his wife. It began with the popping of champagn e corks and was quickl y followed by drunken speech es, during the course of which Marcel le and I played with each other under the table. When it came my turn to stand up and deliver a few words I had to hold the napkin in front of me. It was painfu l and exhilarating at the same time. I had to cut my speech very short because Marcell e was tickling me in the crotch all the while. The dinner lasted until almost midnight. I was looking forward to spending the night with Marcel le in that beautifu l home up on the cliff. But it was not to be. Collins had planned to show us about and I couldn't very well refuse. \"Don 't worry about her,\" he said. \"You'll have a bellyful of it before you leave. Tell her to wait here for you until we get back.\" She was a bit peeved at this, Marce lle, but when we informed her that we had several days ahead of us she brightened up. When we got outdoors Fillmore very solemnly took us by the arm and said he had a little confession to m ake. He looked pale and worried. \"Well, what is it?\" said Collins che erfull y. \"Spit it out!\" Fillmore couldn't spit it out like that, all at once. He hemmed and hawed and finally he blurted out \"W ell, when I went to the closet just a m inute ago I notic ed som ething...\""},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"\"Then you've got it!\" said Collins triumphant ly, and with that he flourished the bottle of \"Vénét ienne.\" \"Don 't go to a docto r,\" he added venomousl y. \"They'll bleed you to death, the greed y bastards. And don't stop drink ing either. That's all hooey. Take this twice a day... shake it well before using. And nothing's worse than worry, do you understand ? Come on now. I'll give you a syringe and some permanganat e when we get back.\" And so we started out into the nigh t, down towards the waterfron t where ther e was the sound of music and shouts and drunken oaths, Collins talking quietl y all the while about this and that, about a boy he had fallen in love with, and the devil's time he had to get out of the scrape when the parents got wise to it. From that he switch ed back to the Baron de Charlus and then to Kurtz who had gone up the river and got lost. His favorit e theme. I liked the wa y Collins m oved against th is background of li terature cont inuousl y; it was like a millionaire who never stepped out of his Rolls Royce. There was no intermediate realm for him betwe en reality and ideas. When we entered the whorehouse on the Quai Voltair e, after he had flung himself on the divan and rung for girls and for drinks, he was still paddling up the river with Kurtz, and only when the girls had flopped on the bed beside him and stuffed his mouth with kisses did he cease his divagat ions. Then, as if he had suddenl y realized where he was, he turned to the old mother who ran the place and gave her an eloquent spiel about his two friends who had come down from Paris expres sly to see the joint. There were about half a dozen girls in the room, all naked and all beau tiful to look at, I must say. They hopped about like birds while the three of us tried to maintain a conversa tion with the grandm other. Finall y the latter excused herself and told us to make ourselves at home. I was altogeth er taken in by her, so sweet and amiable she was, so thoroughl y gentle and maternal. And what manners! If she had been a little younger I would have made overtures to her. Certainly you would not have thought tha t we were in a \"den of vice,\" as it is called. Anyway we sta yed there an hour or so, and as I wa s the only one in condit ion to enjo y the privileges of the house, Collins and Fillmore remained downstairs chattering with the girls. When I returned I found the two of them stretched out on the bed; the girls had formed a semicircle about the bed and were singing with the most angel ic voices the chorus of Roses in Picar dy. We were sentimentally depressed when we left the house – Fillmore particular ly. Collins swiftl y steered us to a rough joint which was packed with drunken sailors on shore leave and there we sat awhile enjoying the homosexual rout that was in full swing. When we sallied out we had to pass through the red - light distric t where there were more grandm others with shawls about their necks sitting on the doorsteps fanning themselves and nodding pleasantl y to the passers - by. All such good- looking, kindly souls, as if they were keeping guard over a nurser y. Little groups of sailors came swinging along and pushed their way noisil y inside the gaudy joints. Sex everywhere: it was slopping over, a neap tide that swept the props from under the city. We piddled along at the edge of the basin where everything was jumbled and tangled; you had the impression that all these ships, these trawlers and yachts and schooners and barges, had been blown a shore by a violen t stor m. In the space of forty - eight hours so many things had happened that it seemed as if we had been in Le Havre a month or more. We were planning to leave early Monda y morning, as Fillmore had to be back on the job. We spent Sunda y drinking and carousing, clap or no clap. That afternoon Collins confided to us that he was thinking of returning to his ranch in Idaho; he hadn't been home for eight years and he wanted to have a look at the moun tains again before making another voyage East. We were sitting"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"in a whorehouse at the time, waiting for a girl to appear; he had promised to slip her some cocaine. He was fed up with Le Havre, he told us. Too many vultures hanging around his neck. Besides, Jimmie's wife had fal len in love with him and she was m aking things hot for him with her jealous fits. There was a scene almost every night. She had been on her good behaviour since we arrived, but it wouldn't last, he promised us. She was particularly jealous of a Russian girl who came to the bar now and then when she got tigh t. A trouble maker. On top of it a ll he was desperat ely in love with this bo y whom he had told us about the first day. \"A boy can break your heart,\" he said. \"He's so damned beautifu l! And so cruel!\" We had to laugh at this. It sounded preposterous. But Collins was in earn est. Around midnigh t Sunda y Fillmore and I retired; we had been given a room upstairs over the bar. It was sultry as the devil, not a breath of air stirring. Through the open windo ws we could hear them shouting downstairs and the gramophone going continua lly. All of a sudden a storm broke – a regular cloudburst. And betwe en the thundercl aps and the squalls that lashed the windowpanes there came to our ears the sound of another storm raging downstairs at the bar. It sounded frightfu lly close and sinister; the women were shriek ing at the tops of their lungs, bottles were crashing, tables were upset and there was that familiar, nauseating thud that the human body makes when it crashes to the floor . About six o'clock Collins stuck his head in the door. His face was all plaster ed and one ar m was stuck in a sling. He had a big grin on his fac e. \"Just as I told you,\" he said. \"She broke loose last night. Suppose you heard the racket?\" We got dressed quickl y and went downstairs to sa y goodb ye to Jim mie. The place was completely demolished, not a bottle left standing, not a chair that wasn't broken. The mirror and the show windo w were smashed to bits. Jimmie was making himself an eggnog. On the way to the station we pieced the story together. The Russian girl had dropped in after we toddled off to bed and Yvette had insult ed her promptly, withou t even waiting for an excuse. They had commenced to pull each other's hair and in the midst of it a big Swede had stepped in and given the Russian girl a sound slap in the jaw – to bring her to her sense s. That started the firework s. Collins wanted to know what right this big stiff had to interfer e in a priva te quarrel. He got a poke in the jaw for an answer , a good one that sent him flying to the other end of the bar. \"Serves you right!\" screa med Yvette, taking advantage of the occ asion to swing a bot tle at the Russian girl's head. And at that moment the thunderstor m broke loose. For a while there was a regul ar pande moniu m, the women all hysterical and hungr y to seize the opportun ity to pay off private grudges. Nothing like a nice barroo m brawl... so easy to stick a knife in a man's back or club him with a bottle when he's lying under a table. The poor Swede found himself in a hornet's nest; everyone in the place hated him, particularly his shipm ates. They wanted to see him done in. And so they locked the door and pushing the tables aside the y made a little space in front of the bar w here the two of them could have it out. And they had it out! They had to carry the poor devil to the hospita l when it was over. Collins had come off rather lucky – nothing more than a sprained wrist and a couple of fingers out of joint, a blood y nose and a black eye. Just a few scratches, as he put it. But if he ever signed up with that Swede he was going to murder him. It wasn't finished yet. He prom ised us that."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"And that wasn't the end of the fracas either. After that Yvette had to go out and get liquored up at anoth er bar. She had been insulted and she was going to put an end to things. And so she hires a taxi and orders the driver to ride out to the edge of the cliff overlooking the water. She was going to kill hersclf, that's what she was going to do. But then she was so drunk that when she tumbled out of the cab she began to weep and before any one could stop her she had begun to peel her clothes off. The driver brought her home that way, half-naked, and when Jimmie saw the condi tion she was in he was so furious with her that he took his razor strop and he belted the piss out of her, and she liked it, the bitch that she was. \"Do it some more!\" she begged, down on her knees as she was and clutching him around the legs with her two arms. But Jimmie had enough of it. \"You're a dirty old sow!\" he said and with his foot he gave her a shove in the guts that took the wind out of her – and a bit of her sexy nonsense too. It was high time we were leaving. The city looked different in the early morning light. The last thing we talked about, as we stood there waiting for the train to pull out, was Idaho. The three of us were Americans. We came from differen t places, each of us, but we had something in common – a whole lot, I might say. We were getting sentimental, as Amer icans do when it comes time to part. We were getting quite foolish about the cows and sheep and the big open spaces where men are men and all that crap. If a boat had swung along instead of the train we'd have hopped aboard and said good - bye to it all. But Collins was never to see Amer ica again, as I learned later, and Fillmore... well, Fillmore has to take his punish ment too, in a way that none of us could have suspected then. It's best to keep Americ a just like that, always in the background, a sort of picture post card which you look at in a weak moment. Like that, you imagine it's always there waiting for you, unchanged, unspoil ed, a big patriot ic open space with cows and sheep and tenderhear ted men ready to bugger everything in sight, man, woman or beast. It doesn 't exist, Amer ica. It's a name you give to an abstract idea..."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Paris is like a whore. From a distan ce she seems ravishing, you can't wait until you have her in your arms. And five minutes later you feel empty, disgu sted with yourself. You fee l tricked. I returned to Paris with money in my pocket – a few hundred francs, which Collins had shoved in my pocket just as I was boarding the train. It was enough to pay for a room and at least a week's good rations. It was more than I had had in my hands at one time for several years. I felt elated, as though perhaps a new life was opening before m e. I wanted to conserve it too, so I looked up a cheap hotel over a baker y on the Rue du Château, just off the Rue de Vanves, a place that Eugene had pointed out to me once. A few y ards away was the bridge that spans the Montparn asse tracks. A familiar quarter . I could have had a room for a hundred francs a month, a room without any convenien ces to be sure – without even a window – and perhaps I would have taken it, just to be sure of a place to flop for a while, had it not been for the fact that in order to reach this room I would have been oblig ed to first pass through the roo m of a blind man. The thought of passing his bed every night had a most depres sing effect on me. I decided to look elsewhere. I went over to the Rue Cels, just behind the cemetery, and I looked at a sort of rat trap there with balcon ies running around the court yard. There were bird cages suspended from the balcon y too, all along the lower t ier. A cheerful sight perhaps, but to me it seem ed like the publi c ward in a hospital. The proprietor didn't seem to have all his wits either. I decided to wait for the night, to have a good look around, and then choose som e attractive little joint in a quie t side stree t. At dinner time I spent fifteen francs for a meal, just about twice the amount I had planned to allot myself. That made me so wretched that I wouldn't allow myself to sit down for a coffee, even despite the fact that it had began to drizzl e. No, I would walk about a bit and then go quietly to bed, at a reasonable hour. I was alread y miserab le, trying to husband my resources this way. I had never in my life done it; it wasn't in my nature. Finall y it began to come down in bucketsful. I was glad. That would give me the excuse I needed to duck somewhere and stretch my legs out. It was still too early to go to bed. I began to quicken my pace, heading back toward the Boulev ard Raspail. Suddenl y a woman comes up to me and stops m e, right in the pouring ra in. She wants to know what time it is. I told her I didn't have a watch. And then she bursts out, just like this: \"Oh, my good sir, do you speak English by chance?\" I nod my head. It's coming down in torrents now. \"Perhaps, my dear good man, you would be so kind as to take me to a café. It is raining so and I haven't the money to sit down anywhere. You will excuse me, my dear sir, but you have such a kind face... I knew you were English right away.\" And with this she smiles at me, a strange, half-de mented smile. \"Perhaps you could give me a little advic e, dear sir. I am all alone in the world... my God, it is terrib le to have no money...\" This \"dear sir\" and \"kind sir\" and \"my good man,\" etc., had me on the verge of hysteria. I felt sorry for her and yet I had to laugh. I did laugh. I laugh ed right in her face. And then she laughed too, a weird, high - pitched laugh, off key, an altogether unexpect ed piece of cachinnation. I caugh t her by the arm and we made a bolt for it to the nearest café. She was still giggling when we entered the bistr o. \"My dear good sir,\" she began again, \"perhaps you think I am not telling you the truth. I am a good girl... I come of a good family. Only\" – and here she gave me that wan, broken smile again –"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"\"only I am so misfortunate as not to have a place to sit down.\" At this I began to laugh again. I couldn't help it – the phrases she used, the strange accen t, the crazy hat she had on, that demented smile... \"Listen,\" I interrupt ed, \"what na tional ity are y ou?\" \"I'm English,\" she repl ied. \"That is, I was born in Poland, but m y father is Irish.\" \"So that m akes y ou English?\" \"Yes,\" she said, and she began to giggle again, sheepishl y, and with a pretense of being co y. \"I suppose you know a nice little hotel where you could take me?\" I said this, not because I had any intention of going with her, but just to spare her the usual preliminaries. \"Oh, my dear sir,\" she said, as though I had made the most grievous error, \"I'm sure you don't mean that! I'm not that kind of a girl. You were joking with me, I can see that. You're so good... you have such a kind face. I would not dare to speak to a French man as I did to y ou. They insult y ou right awa y...\" She went on in this vein for some time. I wanted to break away from her. But she didn't want to be left alone. She was afraid – her papers were not in order. Wouldn't I be good enough to walk her to her hotel? Perhap s I could \"lend\" her fifteen or twent y francs, to quiet the pat ron ? I walked her to the hotel where she said she was stopping and I put a fifty franc bill in her hand. Either she was very clever , or very innocent – it's hard to tell sometimes – but, at any rate, she wanted me to wait until she ran to the bist ro for chang e. I told her not to bother . And with that she seized my hand impulsivel y and raised it to her lips. I was flabber gasted. I felt like giving her every damned thing I had. That touched me, that crazy little gesture. I thought to myself, it's good to be rich once in a while, just to get a new thrill like that. Just the same, I didn't lose my head. Fifty francs! That was quite enough to squander on a rainy night. As I walked off she waved to me with that crazy little bonnet which she didn't know how to wear. It was as though we were old playmates. I felt foolish and giddy. \"My dear kind sir... you have such a gentl e face... you are so good, etc.\" I felt like a saint. When you feel all puffed up inside it isn't so easy to go to bed right away. You feel as though you ought to atone for such unexpected bursts of goodne ss. Passing the \"Jungle\" I caught a glimpse of the dance floor; women with bare backs and ropes of pearls choking them – or so it looked – were wiggl ing their beaut iful bottoms at me. Walked right up to the bar and ordered a coupe of champagne. When the music stopped, a beautifu l blonde – she looked like a Norwegian – took a seat right beside me. The place wasn't as crowded or as gay as it had appeared from outside. There were only a half dozen coupl es in the place – they must have all been dancing at once. I ordered another coupe of cha mpagne in order not to let my courage dribble away. When I got up to dance with the blonde there was no one on the floor but us. Any other time I would have been selfconscious, but the champagne and the way she clung to me, the dimmed lights and the solid feeling of security which the few hundred francs gave me, well... We had anoth er dance togeth er, a sort of private exhibit ion, and then we fell into conversa tion. She had begun to weep – that was how it started. I thought possibly she had had too much to drink, so I pretended not to be concerned. And meanwhil e I was looking around to see if there was any other timber availab le. But the place was thorough ly deserted."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"The thing to do when you're trapped is to breeze – at once. If you don't, you're lost. What retained me, oddly enough, was the thought of paying for a hat check a second time. One alwa ys lets him self in for it because of a trifle. The reason she was weeping, I discover ed soon enough, was because she had just buried her child. She wasn't Norwegian either, but French, and a midwif e to boot. A chic midwife, I must say, even with the tears running down her face. I asked her if a little drink would help to console her, whereupon she very prom ptly ordered a whisk y and tossed it off in the wink of an eye. \"Would you like another?\" I suggested gentl y. She thought she would, she felt so rotten, so terribl y dejected. She though t she would like a package of Camels too. \"No, wait a minute,\" she said, \"I think I'd rather have les Pall Mall.\" Have what you like, I thought, but stop weeping, for Christ's sake, it gives m e the willies. I jerked her to her feet for anoth er dance. On her feet she seemed to be anoth er person. Maybe grief makes one more lecherous, I don't know . I murmured something about breaking away. \"Where to?\" she said eagerly. \"Oh, anywhere. Some quiet place where we can ta lk.\" I went to the toilet and counted the money over again. I hid the hundred franc notes in my fob pocket and kept a fifty franc note and the loose change in my trousers pocke t. I went back to the bar deter mined to talk turke y. She made it easier for me because she herself introduced the subject. She was in difficulties. It was not only that she had just lost her child, but her mother was home, ill, very ill, and there was the doctor to pay and medicine to be bought, and so on and so forth. I didn't believe a word of it, of course. And since I had to find a hotel for myself, I suggested that she come along with me and stay the night. A little econo my there, I thought to myself. But she wouldn't do that. She insisted on going ho me, said she had an apartment to herself – and besides she had to look after her mother. On reflec tion I decided that it would be still cheaper sleep ing at her place, so I said yes and let's go immediately. Before going, however , I decided it was best to let her know just how I stood, so that there wouldn't be any squawking at the last minute. I thought she was going to faint when I told her how much I had in my pocket. \"The likes of it!\" she said. Highl y insult ed she was. I thought there would be a scene... Undaunted, however , I stood my ground. \"Very well, then, I'll leave you,\" I said quietl y. \"Perhaps I've made a mistake.\" \"I should say you have!\" she exclaimed, but clutching me by the sleeve at the same time. \"Ecou te, cheri... sois raisonnable! \" When I heard that all my confid ence was restored. I knew that it would be merely a quest ion of promising her a little extra and everything would be O.K. \" All right,\" I said wearil y, \"I'll be nic e to you, you'll see.\" \"You were lying to me, then?\" she said. \"Yes,\" I s miled, \"I was j ust lying...\" Before I had even put my hat on she had hailed a cab. I heard her give the Boulev ard de Clich y for an address. That was more than the price of room , I thought to myself. Oh well, there was time yet... we'd see. I don't know how it started any more but soon she was raving to me about Henr y Bordeaux. I have yet to meet a whore who doesn 't know of Henr y Bordeaux! But this one was genuin ely inspired; her languag e was beautifu l now, so tend er, so discerning, that I was deba ting how m uch to give her. It seem ed to me that I had heard her say – \"quand il n'y aura plus de temps.\" It sounded like that, anyway. In the state I was in, a phrase like that was worth a hundred francs. I wondered if it was her own or if she had pulled it from Henr y Bordeaux. Little matter. It was just"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"the right phrase with which to roll up to the foot of Montm artre. \"Good evening, mother,\" I was saying to myself, \"daughter and I will look after you – quand il n'y aura plus de temps! \" She wa s going to sho w me her diplo ma, too, I rem embered th at. She was all aflutter, once the door had closed behind us. Distract ed. Wringing her hands and striking Sarah Bernhardt poses, half undressed too, and pausing between times to urge me to hurry, to get undressed, to do this and do that. Final ly, when she had stripped down and was poking about with a chemise in her hand, search ing for her kimono, I caugh t hold of her and gave her a good squeeze. She had a look of anguish on her face when I released her. \"My God! My God! I must go down stairs and have a look at mother!\" she exclaimed. \"You can take a bath if you like, chéri. There! I'll be back in a few minutes.\" At the door I embraced her again. I was in my underclothes and I had a tremendous erection. Somehow all this anguish and excitement, all the grief and histrioni cs, only whetted my appetite. Perhaps she was just going down stairs to quiet her maquer eau. I had a feeling that something unusual was happening, some sort of dram a which I would read about in the morning paper . I gave the place a quick inspection. There were two rooms and a bath, not badly furnished. Rather coquett ish. There was her diploma on the wall – \"first class,\" as they all read. And there was the photograph of a child, a little girl with beautifu l locks, on the dresser . I put the water on for a bath, and then I chang ed my mind. If something were to happen and I were found in the tub... I didn't like the idea. I paced back and forth, getting more and more uneas y as the m inutes roll ed by. When she returned she was even more upset than before. \"She' s going to die... she's going to die!\" she kept wailing. For a moment I was almost on the point of leaving. How the hell can you climb over a woman when her mother's dying down stairs, perhaps right beneath you? I put my arms around her, half in sympathy and half determined to get what I had come for. As we stood thus she murmured, as if in real distress, her need for the money I had promised her. It was for \"maman.\" Shit, I didn't have the heart to haggle about a few francs at the moment. I walked over to the chair where my clothes were lying and I wiggled a hundred franc note out of my fob pocke t, carefull y keeping my back turned to her just the same. And, as a further precau tion, I placed my pants on the side of the bed where I knew I was going to flop. The hundred francs wasn't altoge ther satisfac tory to her, but I could see from the feeble way that she protest ed that it was quite enough. Then, with an energy that astonished me, she flung off her kimono and jump ed into bed. As soon as I had put my arms around her and pulled her to me she reached for the switch and out went the lights. She embraced me passiona tely, and she groaned as all French cunts do when they get you in bed. She was getting me frightful ly roused with her carrying on; that business of turning out the lights was a new one to me... it seemed like the real thing. But I was suspicious too, and as soon as I could manage conven iently I put my hands out to feel if my trousers were still there on the chair. I thought we were settled for the night. The bed felt very comfortab le, softer than the average hotel bed – and the the sheets were clean, I had noticed that. If only she wouldn't squir m so! You would think she hadn't slept with a man for a month. I wanted to stretch it out. I wanted full value for my hundred francs. But she was mumbling all sorts of things in that crazy bed language which goes to your blood even more rapidl y when it's in the dark. I was putting up a stiff fight, but it was impossible with her groaning and gasping going on, and her muttering: \"Vite chéri! Vite chéri! Oh, c'est bon! Oh, oh! Vite, vite, chéri! \" I tried to count but it was like a fire alarm going off."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"\"Vite, chéri!\" and this time she gave such a gasping shudder that bango! I heard the stars chiming and there was my hundred francs gone and the fifty that I had forgotten all about and the lights were on again and with the same alacrity that she had bounced into bed she was bouncing out again and grunting and squealing like an old sow. I lay back and puffed a cigare tte, gazing ruefull y at my pants the while; they were terrib ly wrinkled. In a moment she was back again, wrapping the kimono around her , and telling me in that agitated way which was getting on my nerves that I should make myself at home. \"I'm going downstairs to see mother,\" she said. \"Mais faites comme chez vous, chéri. Je revi ens tout de suite.\" After a quart er of an hour had passed I began to feel thoroughl y restless. I went inside and I read through a letter that was lying on the table. It was nothing of any account – a love letter. In the bathroo m I examined all the bottles on the shelf; she had everything a woman requires to make herself smell beaut iful. I was still hoping that she would come back and give me another fifty francs' worth. But time dragged on and there was no sign of her. I began to grow alarmed. Perhaps there was someone dying down stairs. Absent – mindedly, out of a sense of self - preserva tion, I suppose, I began to put my things on. As I was buckl ing my belt it came to me like a flash how she had stuffed the hundred franc note into her purse. In the excitement of the moment she had thrust the purse in the wardrobe, on the upper shelf. I remembered the gesture she made – standing on her tiptoes and reach ing for the shelf. It didn't take me a minute to open the wardrobe and feel around for the purse. It was still there. I opened it hurried ly and saw my hundred franc note lying snugl y between the silk coverle ts. I put the purse back just as it was, slipped into my coat and shoes, and then I went to the landing and listened intently. I couldn't hear a sound. Where she had gone to, Christ onl y knows. In a jif fy I was back at the wardrobe and fumbling with her purse. I pocke ted the hundred francs and all the loose change besides. Then, closing the door silent ly, I tiptoed down the stairs and when once I had hit the street I walked just as fast as my legs would carry me. At the Café Boudon I stopped for a bite. The whores there having a gay time pelting a fat man who had fallen asleep over his meal. He was sound asleep ; snoring, in fact, and yet his jaws were working away mechanically. The place was in an uproar . There were shouts of \"All aboard!\" and then a concer ted banging of knives and forks. He opened his eyes for a moment, blink ed stupidl y, and then his head rolled forward again on his chest. I put the hundred franc bill carefu lly away in my fob pocket and counted the chang e. The din around me was increasing and I had dif ficulty to recall exactly whether I had seen \"first- class\" on her diplo ma or not. It bothered me. About her mother I didn't give a damn. I hoped she had croaked by now. It would be strange if what she had said were true. Too good to believe. Vite chéri... vite, vite! And the other half - wit with her \"my good sir\" and \"you have such a kind face\"! I wondered if she had really taken a room in that hotel we stopped b y."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"It was along the close of summer when Fillmore invited me to come and live with him. He had a studio apartment overlooking the cavalry barracks just off the Place Dupleix. We had seen a lot of each other since the little trip to Le Havre. If it hadn't been for Fil lmore I didn't know w here I should be toda y – dead, m ost likely. \"I would have asked you long before,\" he said, \"if it hadn't been for that little bitch Jackie. I didn't know ho w to get her of f my hand s.\" I had to smile. It was always like that with Fillmore. He had a genius for attrac ting homeless bit ches. Anyway, Jacki e had fina lly cleared out of her own accord. The rainy season was coming on, the long, drear y stretch of grease and fog and squirts of rain that make you damp and miserab le. An execrable place in the winter , Paris! A climate that eats into your soul, that leaves you bare as the Labrador coast. I noticed with som e anxiet y that the onl y means of heat ing the place was the little stove in the studio. However , it was still comfort able. And the view from the studio window was superb. In the morning Fillmore would shake me roughl y and leave a ten franc note on the pillow . As soon a he had gone I would settle back for a final snooze. Som etimes I would lie abed till noon. Ther e was nothing pressing, except to finish the book, and that didn't worry me much because I was alread y convinced that nobod y would accept it anyway. Neverthel ess, Fillmore was much impressed by it. When he arrived in the evening with a bottle under his arm the first thing he did was to go to the table and see how many pages I had knocked off. At first I enjo yed this show of enthusias m but later, when I was running dry, it made me devilishly uneas y to see him poking around, search ing for the pages that were supposed to trickle out of me like water from a tap. When there was nothing to show I felt exactl y like some bitch whom he had harbored. He used to say about Jackie, I remembered – \"it would have been all right if only she had slipped me a piece of ass once in a while.\" If I had been a woman I would have been only too glad to slip him a piece of ass: it would have been much easier than to feed him the pages which he expe cted. Neverthel ess, he tried to make me feel at ease. There was always plenty of food and wine, and now and then he would insist that I accompany him to a dancing. He was fond of going to a nigger joint on the Rue d'Ode ssa where there was a good - looking mulatto who used to come home with us occasiona lly. The one thing that bothered him was that he couldn't find a French girl who liked to drink. They were all too sober to satisf y him – He liked to bring a woman back to the studio and guzzle it with her before getting down to business. He also liked to have her think that he was an artist. As the man from whom he had rented the place was a painter , it was not difficult to create an impression; the canvases which we had found in the armoi re were soon stuck about the place and one of the unfinished ones conspicuousl y mounted on the ease l. Unfortunat ely they were all of a surreal istic quality and the impression they created was usually unfavorable. Between a whore, a conci erge and a cabine t minister there is not much difference in taste where pictures are concerned. It was a matter of great relief to Fillmore when Mark Swift began to visit us regul arly with the intention of doing my portrai t. Fillmore had a great admiration for Swift. He was a genius, he said. And though there was something feroc ious about everything he tackled never theless when he painted a man or an object y ou could recogniz e it for what it was. At Swift's request I had begun to grow a beard. The shape of my skull, he said,"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"required a beard. I had to sit by the window with the Eiffel Tower in back of me because he wanted the Eiffel Tower in the picture too. He also wanted the typewrit er in the picture. Kruger got the habit of dropping in too about this time; he maintained that Swift knew nothing about painting. It exasperated him to see things out of proportion. He believ ed in Nature's laws, implicitly. Swift didn't give a fuck about Nature; he wanted to paint what was inside his head. Anyway, there was Swift's portrait of me stuck on the easel now, and though everything was out of proportion, even a cabin et minister could see that it was a hu man head, a man with a beard. The concier ge, indeed, began to take a great interest in the picture ; she thought the likeness was strik ing. And she liked the idea of showing th e Eiffel Tower in the background. Things rolled along this way peacefull y for about a month or more. The neighborhood appeal ed to m e, parti cularly at night when the full squalor and lugubriousness of it made itself felt. The little Place, so charming and tranqui l at twilight, could assume the most dismal, sinister character when darkness came on. There was that long, high wall covering one side of the barracks against which there was always a couple embracing each other furtiv ely – often in the rain. A depressing sight to see two lovers squeezed against a prison wall under a gloomy street light: as if they had been driven right to the last bounds. What went on inside the enclosure was also depres sing. On a rainy day I used to stand by the window and look down on the activity below , quite as if it were something going on on another planet. It seem ed incomprehensibl e to me. Everything done according to schedule, but a schedule that must have been deviscd by a lunati c. There they were, floundering around in the mud, the bugles blowing, the horses charging – all within four walls. A sham battle. A lot of tin soldiers who hadn't the least interest in learning how to kill or how to polish their boots or currycomb the horses. Utterl y ridiculous the whole thing, but part of the scheme of things. When they had nothing to do they looked even more ridiculous; they scratched themselves, they walked about with their hands in their pockets, they looked up at the sky. And when an officer came along they clicked their heels and saluted. A madhouse, it seemed to me. Even the horses looked silly. And then sometimes the artillery was dragged out and they went clattering down the street on parade and people stood and gaped and admired the fine uniform s. To me they always looked like an army corps in retrea t; something shabb y, bedraggled, crestfal len about them, their unifor ms too big for their bodies, all the alertn ess, w hich as individua ls the y possess to such a remark able degree, gone now. When the sun came out, however , things looked differen t. There was a ray of hope in their eyes, they walked more elastic ally, they showed a little enthusi asm. Then the color of things peeped out graciously and there was that fuss and bustle so characteristic of the French; at the bist ro on the corner they chattered gaily over their drinks and the officers seem ed more human, more French, I might say. When the sun comes out, any spot in Paris can look beautiful; and if there is a bist ro with an awning rolled down, a few tables on the sidewalk and colored drinks in the glasse s, then people look altogether human. And they are human – the finest people in the world when the sun shines! So intelligen t, so indolen t, so carefre e! It's a crime to herd such a people into barra cks, to put them through exercises, to grade them into privates and sergeants and colone ls and what not. As I say, things were rolling along smoothl y. Now and then Carl came along with a job for me, travel articles which he hated to do himself. They only paid fifty francs a piece, but the y were eas y to do bec ause I had onl y to consult the back issues and revam p the old articles. People only read these things when they were sitting on a toilet or"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"killing time in a waiting room. The princip al thing was to keep the adject ives well furbished – the rest was a matter of dates and statist ics. If it was an importan t article the head of the depart ment signed it himself; he was a half - wit who couldn't speak any language well, but who knew how to find fault. If he found a paragraph that seem ed to him well written he would say – \"Now that's the way I want you to write! That's beautifu l. You have my permission to use it in your book.\" These beautiful paragraphs we sometimes lifted from the encyclopaedia or an old guide book. Some of them Carl did put in to his book – the y had a surreal istic charact er. Then one evening, after I had been out for a walk, I open the door and a woman springs out of the bedroo m. \"So you're the writer!\" she excla ims at once, and she looks at my beard as if to corroborate her impression. \"What a horrid beard!\" she says. \"I think you people must be crazy around here.\" Fillmore is trailing after her with a blanket in his hand. \"She's a princess,\" he says, smacking his lips as if he had just tasted some rare cavia r. The two of them were dressed for the street ; I couldn't understand what they were doing with the bedclo thes. And then it occurr ed to me immediately that Fillmore must have dragged her into the bedroo m to show her his laundr y bag. He always did that with a new woman, especia lly if she was a Française. \"No tickee, no shirtee!\" that's what was stitched on the laundr y bag, and somehow Fillmore had an obsession for explaining this motto to every female who arrived. But this dame was not a Française – he made that clear to me at once. She was Russian – and a princess, no less. He was bubbling over with excitement, like a child that has ju st found a new toy. \"She speaks five langu ages!\" he said, obviousl y overwhel med by such an acco mplishment. \"Non, four! \" she correc ted promp tly. \"Well, four then... Anyway, she's a damned intelligent girl. You ought to hear her speak.\" The princ ess was nervous – she kept scratching her thigh and rubbing her nose. \"Why does he want to make his bed now?\" she asked me abruptl y. \"Does he think he will get me that way? He's a big child. He behaves disgracefu lly. I took him to a Russian restaurant and he danced like a nigge r.\" She wiggled her botto m to illustra te. \"And he talks too much. Too loud. He talks nonsense.\" She swished about the room, examining the paintings and the books, keeping her chin well up all the time but scratch ing herself intermittently. Now and then she wheeled around like a battleship and delivered a broadside. Fillmore kept following her about with a bottle in one hand and a glass in the other. \"Stop following me like that!\" she exclaimed. \"And haven't you anything to drink but this? Can't you get a bottle of champagne? I must have some champagne. My nerves! M y nerves!\" Fillmore tries to whisper a few word s in my ear. \"An actress... a movie star... some guy jilted her and she can't get over it... I'm going to get her cock eyed...\" \"I'll clear out then,\" I was saying, when the princess interrupt ed us with a shout. \"Why do you whisper like that?\" she cried, stamping her foot. \"Don 't you know that's not polite? And you , I thought you were going to take me out? I must get drunk tonigh t, I have told you that alread y.\" \"Yes, yes,\" said Fillmore, \"we're going in a minute. I just want another drink.\" \"You're a pig!\" she yelled. \"But you're a nice boy too. Only you're loud. You have no manners.\" She turned to me. \"Can I trust him to behav e himself? I must get drunk"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"tonight but I don't want him to disgrac e me. Maybe I will come back here afterward. I would like to talk to you. You seem more intel ligent.\" As they were leaving the princess shook my hand cordial ly and promised to come for dinner so me evening – \"when I wil l be sober ,\" she said. \"Fine!\" I said. \"Bring another princess along – or a countess, at least. We change the sheets ever y Saturd ay.\" About three in the morn ing Fillmore staggers in... alone. Lit up like an ocean liner, and making a noise like a blind man with his crack ed cane. Tap, tap, tap, down the weary lane... \"Going straight to bed,\" he says, as he marches past me. \"Tell you all about it tomorrow .\" He goes inside to his room and throws back the covers. I hear him groaning – \"what a woman! what a woman!\" In a second he's out again, with his hat on and the cracked cane in his hand. \"I knew something like that was going to happen. She's craz y!\" He rummages around in the kitchen a while and then cames back to the studio with a bottle of Anjou. I have to sit up and down a glass with hi m. As far as I can piece the story together the whole thing started at the Rond - Point des Cham ps Elysées where he had dropped off for a drink on his way home. As usual at that hour the terra sse was crowded with buzzards. This one was sitting right on the aisle with a pile of saucers in front of her; she was getting drunk quietly all by herself when Fillmore happened along and caught her eye. \"I'm drunk,\" she giggl ed, \"won't you sit down?\" And then, as though it were the most natur al thing in the world to do, she began right off the bat with the yarn about her movie director, how he had given her the go - by and how she had thrown herself in the Seine and so forth and so on. She couldn't remember any more which bridge it was, only that there was a crowd around when they fished her out of the water . Besides, she didn't see what difference it made which bridge she threw herself from – why did he ask such questions ? She was laughing hysterically about it, and then suddenl y she had a desire to be off – she wanted to dance. Seeing him hesitat e she opens her bag impulsive ly and pulls out a hundred franc note. The next moment, however , she decided that a hundred francs wouldn't go very far. \"Haven't you any money at all?\" she said. No, he hadn't very much in his pocke t, but he had a checkbook at home. So th ey made a dash for the checkbook and then, of course, I had to happen in just as he was explain ing to her the \"No ti ckee, no shirtee\" business. On the way home they had stopped off at the Poisson d'Or for a little snack which she had washed down with a few vodkas. She was in her element there with everyone kissing her hand and murmuring Princesse, Princ esse. Drunk as she was, she managed to collect her digni ty. \"Don't wiggle your behind like that!\" she kept saying, as they danced. It was Fill more's idea, when he brought her back to the studio, to sta y there. But, since she was such an intelligent girl and so erratic, he had decid ed to put up with her whims and postpone the grand event. He had even visualiz ed the prospect of running across another princess and bringing the two of them back. When they started out for the evening, therefore, he was in a good humor and prepared, if necessar y, to spend a few hundred francs on her . After all, one doesn 't run acros s a princess ever y day. This time she dragged him to another place, a place where she was still better known and where there would be no troubl e in cashing a check, as she said. Everybody was in"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"evening clothes and there was more spine - breaking, hand-kissing nonsen se as the waiter escorted them to a tabl e. In the middle of a dance she suddenl y walks off the floor, with tears in her eyes. \"What's the matter?\" he said, \"what did I do this time?\" And instinc tively he put his hand to his backside, as though perhaps it might still be wiggling. \"It's nothing,\" she said. \"You didn't do anything. Come, you're a nice boy,\" and with that she drags him on to the floor again and begins to. dance with abandon. \"But what's the matter with you?\" he murmured. \"It's nothing,\" she repea ted. \"I saw somebody, that's all.\" And then, with a sudden spurt of anger – \"why do you get me drunk? Don't you know it makes me crazy?\" \"Have you got a check ?\" she says. \"We must get out of here.\" She called the waiter over and whispered to him in Russian. \"Is it a good check?\" she asked, when the waiter had disappeared. And then, impulsive ly: \"Wait for me downstairs in the cloakroo m. I must telephone somebod y.\" After the waiter had brought the change Fillmore sauntered leisure ly downstairs to the cloakroo m to wait for her. He strode up and down, humming and whistling softly, and smacking his lips in anticipation of the caviar to come. Five minutes passed. Ten minutes. Still whistling softly. When twent y minutes had gone by and still no princess he at last grew suspicious. The cloakroo m attendan t said that she had left long ago. He dashed outside. There was a nigger in livery standing there with a big grin on his face. Did the nigger know where she had breezed to? Nigger grins. Nigger says: \"Ah heerd Coupole, dassall sir!\" At the Coupole, downstairs, he finds her sitting in front of a cocktail with a dreamy, trance like expression on her face. She sm iles when she sees hi m. \"Was that a decen t thing to do,\" he says, \"to run away like that? You might have told me that you didn't like me...\" She flared up at this, got theatrical about it. And after a lot of gushing she commenced to whine and slobber . \"I'm crazy,\" she blubbered. \"And y ou're crazy too. You want m e to sleep with you, and I don't want to sleep with you.\" And then she began to rave about her lover , the movie director whom she had seen on the dance floor. That's why she had to run away from the place. That's why she took drugs and got drunk every night. That's why she threw herself in the Seine. She babbled on this way about how crazy she was and then suddenl y she had an idea. \"Let's go to Bricktop's!\" There was a man there whom she knew... he had pro mised her a job once. She was certa in he would help her. \"What's it going to cost?\" asked Fill more caut iously. It would cost a lot, she let him know that immediately. \"But listen, if you take me to Bricktop's, I promise to go home with you.\" She was honest enough to add that it might cost him five or six hundred francs. \"But I'm worth it! You don't know what a woman I am. There isn't another woman like me in all Paris... \" \"That's what you think!\" His Yankee blood was coming to the fore. \"But I don't see it. I don't see that you're worth anything. You're just a poor crazy son - of - a - bitch. Frankly, I'd rather give fifty francs to some poor French girl; at least they give you something in return.\" She hit the ceiling when he mention ed the French girls. \"Don't talk to me about those women! I hate them! They're stupid... they're ugly... they're mercenar y. Stop it, I tell you!\""},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"In a moment she had subsided again. She was on a new tack. \"Darling,\" she murmured, \"you don't know what I look like when I'm undres sed. I'm beaut iful !\" And she held her breasts with her two hands. But Fillmore remained unimpressed. \"You're a bitch!\" he said coldl y. \"I wouldn't mind spending a few hundred francs on you, but you're crazy. You haven't even washed your face. Your breath stinks. I don't give a damn whether you're a princ ess or not... I don't want any of your high - assed Russian variety. You ought to get out in the street and hustle for it. You're no better than any little French girl. You're not as good. I wouldn't piss away another sou on you. You ought to go to America – that's the place for a bloodsucking le ech like you...\" She didn't seem to be at all put out by this speech. \"I think you're just a little afraid of me,\" she said. \"Afraid of y ou? Of you? \" \"You're just a little boy,\" she said. \"You have no manners. When you know me better you will t alk dif ferently... Why don't you try to be nice? If y ou don't want to go with me tonight, very well. I will be at the Rond - Point tomorrow between five and seven. I like you.\" \"I don't intend to be at the Rond - Point tomorrow , or any other night! I don't want to see you again... ever. I'm through with you. I'm going out and find myself a nice little French girl. You can go to hell!\" She looked at him and smiled wearil y. \"That's what you say now. But wait! Wait until you've slept with me. You don't know yet what a beautiful body I have. You think the French girls know how to make love... wait! I will make you crazy about me. I like you. Only you're uncivil ized. You're j ust a boy. You talk too m uch...\" \"You're crazy,\" said Fillmore. \"I wouldn't fall for you if you were the last woman on earth. Go home and wash y our face.\" He walked off without pa ying for the drinks. In a few days, however , the princess was install ed. She's a genuine princess, of that we're pretty certain. But she has the clap. Anyway, life is far from dull here. Fillmore has bronchi tis, the princess, as I was saying, has the clap, and I have the piles. Just exchanged six empty bottles at the Russian épiceri e across the way. Not a drop went down m y gulle t. No me at, no wine, no rich game, no w omen. Only fruit and paraf fin oi l, arnica drops and adren alin ointment. And not a chair in the joint that's comfort able enough. Right now, looking at the princ ess, I'm propped up like a pasha. Pasha! That reminds me of her name: Macha. Doesn't sound so damned aristocrat ic to me. Reminds me of The Living Corp se. At first I thought it was going to be embarrassing, a ménage à trois, but not at all. I thought when I saw her move in that it was all up with me again, that I should have to find another place, but Fillmore soon gave me to understand that he was only putting her up until she got on her feet. With a woman like her I don't know what an expression like that means; as far as I can see she's been standing on her head all her life. She says the revolut ion drove her out of Russia, but I'm sure if it hadn't been the revolution it would have been something else. She's under the impression that she's a great actress, we never contr adict her in anything she says because it's time wasted. Fillmore finds her amusing. When he leaves for the office in the morning he drops ten francs on her pillow and ten francs on mine; at night the three of us go to the Russian restaurant down be low. The neighborhood is full of Russians and Macha has alread y found a place where she"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"can run up a little credit. Naturall y ten francs a day isn't anything for a princess; she wants caviar now and then and cham pagne, and she needs a complete new wardrobe in order to get a job in the movies again. She has nothing to do now except to kill time. She's putt ing on fat. This morn ing I had quite a fright. After I had washed my face I grabbed her towel by mistake. We can't seem to train her to put her towel on the right hook. And when I bawled her out for it she answered smooth ly: \"My dear, if one can become blind from that I would have been blind y ears ago.\" And then there's the toilet, which we all have to use. I try speaking to her in a fatherly way about the toilet seat. \"Oh zut!\" she says. \"If you are so afraid I'll go to a café.\" But it's not necessar y to do that, I explain. Just use ordin ary precautions. \"Tut tut!\" she says, \"I won't sit down th en... I'll stand up.\" Everything is cocke yed with her around. First she wouldn't come across because she had the mon thlies. For eight days that last ed. We were beginning to think she wa s faking it. But no, she wasn't faking. One day, when I was trying to put the place in order , I found some cotton batting under the bed and it was stained with blood. With her everything goes under the bed: orange peel, wadding, corks, empty bottles, scissors, used condo ms, books, pillows... She makes the bed only when it's time to retire. Most of the time she lies abed reading her Russian papers. \"My dear,\" she says to me, \"if it weren't for my papers I wouldn't get out of bed at all.\" That's it precisel y! Nothing but Russian newspapers. Not a scratch of toilet paper around – nothing but Russian newspapers with which to wipe your ass. Anyway, speaking of her idiosyncrasies, after the menstrua l flow was over, after she had rested properl y and put a nice layer of fat around her belt, still she wouldn't come across. Pretended that she only liked women. To take on a man she had to first be properl y stimulated. Wanted us to take her to a bawd y house where they put on the dog and man act. Or better still, she said, would be Leda and the swan: the flapping of the wings exc ited her terr ibly. One night, to test her out, we accompanied her to a place that she suggested. But before we had a chance to broach the subject to the madam, a drunken English man, who was sitting at the next table, fell into a conversation with us. He had already been upstairs twice but he wanted another try at it. He had only about twent y francs in his pocket, and not knowing any French, he asked us if we would help him to bargain with the girl he had his eye on. Happened she was a Negress, a powerful wench from Martinique, and beautiful as a panthe r. Had a lovely disposition too. In order to persuade her to accept the Englishman's remaining sous, Fillmore had to prom ise to go with her himself soon as she got through with the Englishm an. The princess looked on, heard everything that was said, and then got on her high horse. She was insulted. \"Well,\" said Fillmore, \"you wanted some excitement – you can watch me do it!\" She didn't want to watch him – she wanted to watch a drake. \"Well, by Jesus,\" he said, \"I'm as good as a drake any day... maybe a little better.\" Like that, one word led to anothe r, and finall y the only way we could appease her was to call one of the girls over and let them tickle each other... When Fillmore came back with the Negre ss her eyes were smoldering. I could see fro m the wa y Fillmore looked at her that she mus t have given an unusual perfor mance and I began to feel lecherous myself. Fillmore must have sensed how I felt, and what an ordeal it was to sit and look on all night, for suddenl y he pulled a hundred franc note out of his pocket and slapping it in front of me, he said: \"Look"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"here, you probabl y need a lay more than any of us. Take that and pick someone out for yourself.\" Somehow that gesture endeared him more to me than anything he had ever done for me, and he had done considerab le. I accepted the money in the spirit it was given and promp tly signaled to the Negress to get ready for anoth er lay. That enraged the princess more than anything, it appe ared. She wanted to know if there wasn't anyone in the place good enough for us excep t this Negre ss. I told her blunt ly NO. And it was so – the Negress was the queen of the harem. You had only to look at her to get an erection. Her eyes seemed to be swimming in sperm. She was drunk with all the demands made upon her. She couldn't walk straight any more – at least it seemed that way to me. Going up the narrow winding stairs behind her I couldn't resist the temptation to slide my hand up her crotch; we continued up the stairs that way, she looking back at me with a cheerful smile and wiggl ing her ass a bit when it tickled her too m uch. It was a good session all around. Everyone was happy. Macha seemed to be in a good mood too. And so the next evening, after she had had her ration of cham pagne and cavia r, after she had given us anoth er chapt er out of the histor y of her life, Fillmore went to work on her. It seemed as though he was going to get his reward at last. She had ceased to put up a fight any more. She lay back with her legs apart and she let him fool around and fool around and then, just as he was climbing over her, just as he was going to slip it in, she informs him nonchalan tly that she has a dose of clap. He rolled off her like a log. I heard him fumbling around in the kitchen for the black soap he used on special occasions, and in a few moments he was standing by my bed with a towel in his hands and saying – \"can you beat that? that son - of - a - bitch of a princess has the clap!\" He seemed pretty well scared about it. The princess meanwhil e was munching an apple and calling for her Russian newspapers. It was quite a joke to her. \"There are worse things than that,\" she said, lying there in her bed and talking to us through the open door. Finall y Fillmore began to see it as a joke too and opening another bottle of Anjou he poured out a drink for himself and quaffed it down. It was only about one in the morning and so he sat there talking to me for a while. He wasn 't going to be put off by a thing like that, he told me. Of course, he had to be careful... there was the old dose which had come on in Le Havre. He couldn't remember any more how that happened. Sometimes when he got drunk he forgot to wash himself. It wasn 't anything very terrib le, but you never knew what might develop later. He didn't want any one massaging his prostat e gland. No, that he didn't relish. The first dose he ever got was at colleg e. Didn't know whether the girl had given it to him or he to the girl; there was so much funny work going on about the campus you didn't know whom to believe. Nearl y all the coeds had been knocked up some time or other. Too damned ignorant... even the profs were ignorant. One of th e profs had hi mself castrat ed, so the ru mor went... Anyway, the next night he decid ed to risk it – with a condo m. Not much risk in that, unless it breaks. He had bought himself some of the long fish skin variety – they were the most reliab le, he assured me. But then, that didn't work either. She was too tight. \"Jesus, there's nothing abnor mal about me,\" he said. \"How do you make that out? Somebody got inside her all right to give her that dose. He must have been abnor mally small.\" So, one thing after anoth er failing, he just gave it up altogethe r. They lie there now like brother and sister, with incestuous dreams. Says Macha, in her philosophic way: \"In Russia it often happens that a man sleeps with a woman without touching her. They can go on that way for week s and weeks and never think anything about it. Until paff! once"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"he touches her... paf f! paf f! After that it's paf f, paf f, paf f!\" All efforts are concen trated now on getting Macha into shape. Fillmore thinks if he cures her of the clap she may loosen up. A strange idea. So he's bought her a douche bag, a stock of perm angana te, a whirling syringe and other little things which were recommended to him by a Hungari an doctor , a little quack of an abortion ist over near the Place d'Aligre. It seems his boss had knocked up a sixteen - year - old girl once and she had introduc ed him to the Hungari an; and then after that the boss had a beautifu l chancre and it was the Hungarian again. That's how one gets acquain ted in Paris – genito- urinar y friendships. Anyway, under our strict supervision, Macha is taking care of herself. The other night, though, we were in a quandar y for a while. She stuck the suppositor y inside her and then she couldn't find the string attached to it. \"My God!\" she was yelling, \"where is that string ? My God! I can't find the string!\" \"Did you look under the bed?\" said Fillmore. Finall y she quieted down. But only for a few minutes. The next thing was: \"My God! I'm bleeding again. I just had my period and now there are gouttes again. It must be that cheap cham pagne you buy. My God, do you want me to bleed to death?\" She comes out with a kimono on and a towel stuck betwe en her legs, trying to look dignifi ed as usual. \"My whole life is just like that,\" she says. \"I'm a neurasthen ic. The whole day running around and at night I'm drunk again. When I came to Paris I was still an innocen t girl. I read only Villon and Baude laire. But as I had then 300,000 Swiss francs in the bank I was crazy to enjoy myself, because in Russia they were always strict with me. And as I was even more beaut iful then than I am now, I had all the men falling at my feet.\" Here she hitched up the slack which had accumulated around her belt. \"You mustn't think I had a stomach like that when I came here... that's from all the poison I was given to drink... those horrib le apérit ifs which the French are so crazy to drink... So then I met my movie director and he wanted that I should play a part for him. He said I was the most gorgeous creatur e in the world and he was begging me to sleep with him every night. I was a foolish young virgin and so I permitted him to rape me one night. I wanted to be a great actress and I didn't know he was full of poison. So he gave me the clap... and now I want that he should have it back again. It's his fault that I committed suicide in the Seine... Why are you laugh ing? Don't you believe that I committed suicide? I can show you the newspapers... there is my picture in all the papers. I will show you the Russian papers some day... they wrote about me wonderfull y... But darling, you know that first I must have a new dress. I can't vamp this man with these dirty rags I a m in. Besides, I sti ll owe m y dressmaker 12,000 francs...\" From here on it's a long story about the inher itance which she is trying to collect. She has a young lawyer, a Frenchm an, who is rather timid, it seems, and he is trying to win back her fortune. From time to time he used to give her a hundred francs or so on account. \"He's stingy, like all the French people,\" she says. \"And I was so beautifu l, too, that he couldn't keep his eyes off me. He kept begging me always to fuck him. I got so sick and tired of listening to him that one night I said yes, just to keep him quiet, and so as I wouldn't lose my hundred francs now and then.\" She paused a moment to laugh hysterically. \"My dear,\" she continu ed, \"it was too funny for words what happen ed to him. He calls me up on the phone one day and he says: 'I must see you right away... it's very impor tant.' And when I see him he show s me a paper from the doctor – and it's gonorrhea! My dear, I laughed in his face. How should I know that I still had the clap?"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"'You wanted to fuck m e and so I fucked y ou!' That made him quiet. That's how it goes in life... you don't suspect anything, and then all of a sudden paff, paff, paff! He was such a fool that he fell in love with me all over again. Only he begged me to behav e myself and not run around Montparn asse all night drinking and fucking. He said I was driving him crazy. He wanted to marry me and then his family heard about me and they persuaded hi m to go to Indo - China...\" From this Macha calmly switches to an affair she had with a Lesbi an. \"It was very funny, my dear, how she picked me up one night. I was at the \"Fétiche\" and I was drunk as usual. She took me from one place to the other and she made love to me under the table all night until I couldn't stand it any more. Then she cook me to her apartment and for two hundred francs I let her suck me off. She wanted me to live with her but I didn't want to have her suck me off every night... it makes you too weak. Besides, I can tell you that I don't care so much for Lesbians as I used to. I would rather sleep with a man even though it hurts me. When I get terribl y excited I can't hold myself back any more... three, four, five times... just like that! Paff, paff, paff! And then I bleed and that is very unheal thy for me because I am inclined to be anem ic. So you see why once in a while I m ust let myself be sucked by a Lesbian...\""},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"When the cold weather set in the princess disappe ared. It was getting uncom fortab le with just a little coal stove in the studio; the bedroo m was like an icebox and the kitchen was hardl y any better. There was just a little space around the stove where it was actua lly warm. So Macha had found herself a sculptor who was castrat ed. She told us about him before she left. After a few days she tried coming back to us, but Fillmore wouldn't hear of it. She complained that the sculptor kept her awake all night kissing her. And then there was no hot water for her douches. But finally she decided that it was just as well she didn't come back. \"I won't have that candlest ick next to me any more,\" she said. \"Alwa ys that candlestick... it made me nervous. If you had only been a fairy I would have sta yed with y ou...\" With Macha gone our evenings took on a different charact er. Often we sat by the fire drinking hot toddies and discus sing the life back there in the States. We talked about it as if we never expected to go back there again. Fillmore had a map of New York City which he had tacked on the wall; we used to spend whole evenings discussing the relative virtues of Paris and New York. And inevitably there always crept into our discus sions the figure of Whitman, that one lone figure which America has produced in the course of her brief life. In Whitman the whole American scene comes to life, her past and her future, her birth and her death. Whatever there is of value in America Whitman has expressed, and there is nothing more to be said. The future belongs to the machine, to the robots. He was the Poet of the Body and the Soul, Whitman. The first and the last poet. He is almost undeciph erable today, a monu ment cover ed with rude hierogl yphs for which there is no key. It seems strange almost to mention his name over here. There is no equiva lent in the languag es of Europe for the spirit which he immortalized. Europe is saturat ed with art and her soil is full of dead bones and her museums are bursting with plunder ed treasures, but what Europe has never had is a free, health y spirit, what you might call a MAN. Goethe was the nearest approach, but Goethe was a stuffed shirt, by comparison. Goethe was a respectab le citizen, a pedan t, a bore, a universa l spirit, but stamped with the Germ an trade - mark, with the double eagle. The serenit y of Goethe, the calm, Olympian attitude, is nothing more than the drow sy stupor of a German burgeois deity. Goethe is an end of something, Whitman is a beginning. After a discussion of this sort I would sometimes put on my things and go for a walk, bundled up in a sweater, a spring overcoat of Fillmore's and a cape over that. A foul, damp cold against which there is no protec tion except a strong spirit. They say Americ a is a countr y of extremes, and it is true that the thermometer registers degre es of cold which are practic ally unheard of here; but the cold of a Paris winter is a cold unknown to Americ a, it is psychologi cal, an inner as well as an outer cold. If it never freezes here it never thaws either. Just as the people protect themselves against the invasion of their privac y, by their high walls, their bolts and shutters, their growling, evil - tongued, slattern ly concier ges, so they have learned to protect themselves against the cold and heat of a bracing, vigorous climate. They have fortified themselves: prote ction is the keyword. Protection and securi ty. In order that they may rot in comfort. On a damp winter's night it is not necessar y to look at the map to discover the latitude of Paris. It is a northern city, an outpost erected over a swam p filled in with skulls and bones. Along the boulevards there is a cold electr ical imitation of heat. Tout V a Bien in ultraviole t rays that make the clients of the Dupont chain cafés look like gangrened cadav ers. Tout Va Bien! That's the motto that nourishes the forlorn beggars who walk up and down all"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"night under the drizzl e of the violet - rays. Wherever there are lights there is a little heat. One gets warm from watching the fat, secure bastards down their grogs, their steaming black coffees. Where the lights are there are people on the sidewalks, jostling one another , giving off a little animal heat through their dirty underwear and their foul, cursing breaths. Maybe for a stretch of eight or ten blocks there is a semb lance of gaie ty, and then it tumbles back into night, dismal, foul, black night like frozen fat in a soup tureen. Blocks and blocks of jagged tenements, every window closed tight, every shopfront barred and bolted. Miles and miles of stone prisons without the faintest glow of warmth; the dogs and the cats are all inside with the canar y buds. The cockro aches and the bedbugs too are safely incarc erated. Tout Va Bien. If you haven't a sou why just take a few old newspapers and make yourself a bed on the steps of a cathedra l. The doors are well bolted and there will be no draughts to disturb you. Better still is to sleep outside the Metro doors; there you will have company. Look at them on a rainy night, lying there stiff as mattresses – men, women, lice, all huddled together and protec ted by the newspapers against spittle and the vermin that walks without legs. Look at them under the bridges or under the market sheds. How vile they look in compar ison with the clean, brigh t vegetabl es stack ed up like jewels. Even the dead horses and the cows and sheep hanging from the greas y hooks look more inviting. At least we will eat these tomorrow and even the intestines will serve a purpo se. But these filthy beggars lying in the rain, what purpo se do they serve ? What good can they do us? They make us bleed for five m inutes, tha t's all. Oh, well, these are night thoughts produced by walking in the rain after two thousand years of Christian ity. At least now the birds are well provided for, and the cats and dogs. Every time I pass the concierge's window and catch the full icy impact of her glance I have an insane desire to thrott le all the birds in creation. At the botto m of every frozen heart there is a drop or two of love – ju st enough to feed the birds. Still I can't get it out of m y mind what a discrep ancy there is betwe en ideas and living. A permanent disloc ation, though we try to cover the two with a brigh t awning. And it won't go. Ideas have to be wedded to action; if there is no sex, no vitality in them, there is no action. Ideas cannot exist alone in the vacuu m of the mind. Ideas are related to living : liver ideas, kidne y ideas, interstitial ideas, etc. If it were only for the sake of an idea Copernicus would have smashed the existent macrocosm and Columbus would have foundered in the Sargasso Sea. The aesthet ics of the idea breeds flowerpots and flowerpots you put on the window sill. But if there be no rain or sun of what use putting flowerpots outside the window ? Fillmore is full of ideas about gold. The \"mythos\" of gold, he calls it. I like \"mythos\" and I like the idea of gold, but I am not obsessed by the subject and I don't see why we should make flowerpots, even of gold. He tells me that the French are hoarding their gold away in watertigh t compar tments deep below the surface of the earth; he tells me that there is a little locomotive which runs around in these subterrane an vaults and corridors. I like the idea enormousl y. A profound, uninterrupt ed silenc e in which the gold softly snoozes at a temper ature of 17½ degrees Centigr ade. He says an army working 46 days and 37 hours would not be sufficient to count all the gold that is sunk beneath the Bank of France, and that there is a reserve suppl y of false teeth, bracele ts, wedding rings, etc. Enough food also to last for eighty days and a lake on top of the gold pile to resist the shock of high explosives. Gold, he says, tends to become more and more invisible, a myth, and no more defalca tions. Excellent! I am wondering what will happen to the world when we go off the gold standard in ideas, dress, morals, etc."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"The gold standar d of love! Up to the present, my idea in collabora ting with myself has been to get off the gold standard of literature. My idea brief ly has been to present a resurrection of the emotions, to depict the conduc t of a human being in the stratosphere of ideas, that is, in the grip of delirium. To paint a pre-Socra tic being, a creature part goat, part Titan. In short, to erect a world on the basis of the omphalos, not on an abstract idea nailed to a cross. Here and there you may have come across neglected statues, oases untapped, wind mills overlooked by Cervantes, rivers that run uphill, women with five and six breasts ranged longitud inally along the torso. (Writing to Gauguin, Strindber g said: \"J'ai vu des arbr es que ne retrouverai t aucun botan iste, des animaux que Cuvier n'a jamais soupçonnés et des ho mmes que vous seul avez pu c réer .\" ) When Rembrandt hit par he went below with the gold ingots and the pemmican and the portabl e beds. Gold is a night word belonging to the chthon ian mind: it has dream in it and mythos. We are reverting to alchemy, to that fake Alexandri an wisdom which produced our inflated symbols. Real wisdom is being stored away in the subcellars by the misers of learning. The day is coming when they will be circling around in the middle air with magnetizers; to find a piece of ore you will have to go up ten thousand feet with a pair of instrum ents – in a cold latitude preferabl y – and establ ish telepathi c communication with the bowels of the earth and the shades of the dead. No more Klondikes. No more bonanzas. You will have to learn to sing and caper a bit, to read the zodiac and study your entrails. All the gold that is being tucked away in the pocke ts of the earth will have to be re - mined; all this symbolism will have to be dragged out again from the bowels of man. But first the instru ments must be perfec ted. First it is necessar y to inven t better airplanes, to distinguish whe re the noise comes from and not go daffy just because you hear an explosion under your ass. And secondl y it will be necessar y to get adapted to the cold layers of the stratosphere, to become a cold - blooded fish of the air. No rever ence. No piety. No longing. No regre ts. No hysteria. Above all, as Philippe Datz sa ys – \"N O DISC OURA GEMENT!\" These are sunny thoughts inspired by a vermouth cassis at the Place de la Trinité. A Saturda y afternoon and a \"misfire\" book in my hands. Everything swim ming in a divine mucopus. The drink leaves a bitter herbish taste in my mouth, the lees of our Great Western civilization, rotting now like the toenai ls of the saints. Women are passing by – regiments of them – all swinging their asses in front of me; the chimes are ringing and the buses are climbing the sidewalk and bussing one anothe r. The garçon wipes the table with a dirty rag while the pat ronne tickles the cash register with fiendish glee. A look of vacui ty on my face, blotto, vague in acuity, biting the asses that brush by me. In the belfry opposite the hunchback strikes with a golden mallet and the pigeons screa m alarum. I open the book – the book which Nietzsch e called \"the best German book there is\" – and it says: \"MEN WILL BECO ME MORE CLEVER AND MORE ACUTE; BUT NOT BETTER, HAPPIER, AND STRO NGER IN ACTION – OR, AT LEAST , ONLY AT EPOC HS.

At least a hundred years ago there was a man who had vision enough to see that the world was pooped out. Our Western world! – When I see the figures of men and women moving listlessl y behind their prison walls, sheltered, seclud ed for a few brief hours, I am appalled by the potent ialities for dram a that are still conta ined in these feeble bodies. Behind the gray walls there are human sparks, and yet never a conflagra tion. Are these men and women, I ask myself, or are these shadow s, shadow s of puppets dangled by invisibl e strings? They move in freedom appar ently, but they have nowhere to go. In one realm only are they free and there they may roam at will – but they have not yet learned how to take wing. So far there have been no dreams that have taken wing. Not one man has been born light enough, gay enough, to leave the earth! The eagles who flapp ed their mighty pinions for a while came crashing heavily to earth. They made us dizzy with the flap and whir of their wings. Stay on the earth, you eagles of the future! The heavens have been explored and they are empty. And what lies under the earth is empty too, filled with bones and shadows. Stay on the earth and swim another few hundred thousand y ears! And now it is three o'clock in the morning and we have a couple of trollops here who are doing somersau lts on the bare floor. Fillmore is walking around naked with a goble t in his hand, and that paunch of his is drumtight, hard as a fistula. All the Pernod and champagn e and cogna c and Anjou which he guzzled from three in the afternoon on, is gurgling in his trap like a sewer . The girls are putting their ears to his belly as if it were a music box. Open his mouth with a buttonhook and drop a slug in the slot. When the sewer gurgles I hear the bats fl ying out of the belfr y and th e drea m slides into artifice. The girls have undressed and we are exam ining the floor to make sure that they won't get any splinters in their ass. They are still wearing their high - heeled shoes. But the ass! The ass is worn down, scraped, sandpapered, smooth, hard, bright as a billiard ball or the skull of a leper. On the wall is Mona' s picture: she is facing northeast on a line with Cracow written in green ink. To the left of her is the Dordogne, encircled with a red pencil. Suddenl y I see a dark, hairy crack in front of me set in a bright, polished billiard ball; the legs are holding me like a pair of scissors. A glanc e at that dark, unstitch ed wound and a deep fissure in my brain opens up: all the images and memories that had been laboriousl y or absent - mindedly assorted, labeled, docum ented, filed, sealed and stamped break forth pell - mell like ants pouring out of a crack in the sidewalk ; the world ceases to revolve, time stops, the very nexus of my dreams is broken and dissolved and my guts spill out in a grand schizophren ic rush, an evacu ation that leaves me face to face with the Absolute. I see again the great sprawling mothers of Picasso, their breasts covered with spiders, their legend hidden deep in the labyrinth. And Molly Bloom lying on a dirty mattress for eterni ty. On the toilet door red chalk cocks and the madonna uttering the diapason of woe. I hear a wild, hysterical laugh, a room full of lockjaw , and the body that was black glows like phosphorus. Wild, wild, utterly uncontroll able laughte r, and that crack laughing at me too, laughing through the mossy whiskers, a laugh that creases the bright, polished surface of the billiard ball. Great whore and mother of man with gin in her veins. Mother of all harlots, spider rolling us in your logari thmic grave, insatiable one, fiend whose laughter rives me!

Every bat flying out of the belfry a lost cause, every whoopla a groan over the radio from the private trenches of the da mned. Out of that dark, unstit ched wound, that sink of abom inations, that cradle of black - thronged cities where the music of ideas is drowned in cold fat, out of strangled Utopi as is born a clown, a be ing divided between beaut y and ugliness, between light and chaos, a clown who when he looks down and sidelong is Satan hi mself and when he looks up ward sees a buttered angel, a snail with wings. When I look down into that crack I see an equat ion sign, the world at balanc e, a world reduced to zero and no trace of remainder. Not the zero on which Van Norden turned his flashligh t, not the empty crack of the prematurely disillusion ed man, but an Arabian zero rather , the sign from which spring endless mathematical worlds, the fulcru m which balanc es the stars and the light dreams and the machines lighter than air and the lightwe ight limbs and the explosives that produced them. Into that crack I would like to penetra te up to the eyes, make them waggle ferociousl y, dear, crazy, metallurgical eyes. When the eyes waggle then will I hear again Dostoevski's words, hear them rolling on page after page, with minutest observat ion, with maddest introspe ction, with all the undertones of misery now lightl y, humorousl y touch ed, now swelling like an organ note until the heart bursts and there is nothing left but a blinding, scorching light, the radiant light that carries of f the fecundat ing seeds of the stars. The story of art whose roots li e in massacre. When I look down into this fucked - out cunt of a whore I feel the whole world benea th me, a world totter ing and crumbling, a world used up and polished like a leper's skull. If there were a man who dared to say all that he thought of this world there would not be left him a square foot of ground to stand on. When a man appears the world bears down on him and breaks his back. There are always too many rotten pillars left standing, too much fester ing humanity for man to bloom. The superstructur e is a lie and the foundation is a huge quaking fear. If at intervals of centuries there does appear a man with a despera te, hungr y look in his eye, a man who would turn the world upside down in order to create a new race, the love that he brings to the world is turned to bile and he becomes a scour ge. If now and then we encoun ter pages that explode, pages that wound and sear, that wring groans and tears and curses, know that they come from a man with his back up, a man whose only defenses left are his word s and his word s are always stronger than the lying, crushing weight of the world, stronger than all the racks and wheels which the cowardl y inven t to crush out the miracle of personali ty. If any man ever dared to translat e all that is in his heart, to put down what is really his experien ce, what is truly his truth, I think then the world would go to smash, that it would be blown to smithereens and no god, no acciden t, no will could ever again assemble the pieces, the ato ms, the indestruct ible elements that have gone to m ake up the world. In the four hundred years since the last devour ing soul appear ed, the last man to know the meaning of ecstas y, there has been a constant and stead y declin e of man in art, in thought, in action. The world is pooped out: there isn't a dry fart left. Who that has a desperate, hungr y eye can have the slightest regard for these existent govern ments, laws, codes, princip les, ideals, ideas, totems, and taboos ? If anyone knew what it meant to read the riddle of that thing which today is called a \"crack\" or a \"hole,\" if any one had the least feeling of mystery about the pheno mena which are labeled \"obscene,\" this world would crack asunde r.

And he puts the live wire right between the legs; he hits below the belt, scorches the very gizzards. It is no use putting on rubber gloves; all that can be coolly and intellectually handled belongs to the carap ace and a man who is intent on creation always dives benea th, to the open wound, to the festering obscene horror . He hitches his dynamo to the tenderest parts; if only blood and pus gush forth, it is something. The dry, fucked-out crater is obscene. More obscene than anything is inertia. More blasphe mous than the bloodiest oath is paral ysis. If there is only a gaping wound left then it must gush forth though it produce nothing but toads and bats and ho muncu li. Everything is packed into a second which is either consu mmated or not consum mated. The earth is not an arid plateau of health and comfort, but a great sprawl ing female with velvet torso that swells and heaves with ocean billows; she squirms beneath a diade m of sweat and anguish. Naked and sexed she rolls among the clouds in the violet light of the stars. All of her, from her generous breasts to her gleaming thighs, blazes with furious ardor . She moves amongst the season s and the years with a grand whoopl a that seizes the torso with parox ysmal fury, that shakes the cobwebs out of the sky; she subsides on her pivot al orbits with volcanic tremors. She is like a doe at times, a doe that has fallen into a snare and lies waiting with beating heart for the cymbals to crash and the dogs to bark. Love and hate, despai r, pity, rage, disgust – what are these amidst the fornicat ions of the planets? What is war, disease, cruelty, terror , when night presents the ecstasy of myriad blazing suns? What is this chaff we chew in our sleep if it is not the remembrance of fang - whorl and star clust er. She used to say to me, Mona, in her fits of exaltation, \"you're a great human being,\" and though she left me here to perish, though she put benea th my feet a great howling pit of emptiness, the word s that lie at the botto m of my soul leap forth and they light the shadows below me. I am one who was lost in the crowd, whom the fizzing lights made dizzy, a zero who saw everything about him reduced to mockery. Passed me men and women ignited with sulfur , porters in calcium livery opening the jaws of hell, fame walking on crutches, dwindl ed by the skyscrapers, chewed to a frazzle by the spiked mouth of the machines. I walked between the tall build ings toward the cool of the river and I saw the lights shoot up betwe en the ribs of the skeletons like rocke ts. If I was trul y a great human being, as she said, then what was the meaning of this slavering idioc y about me? I was a man with body and soul, I had a heart that was not prote cted by a steel vault. I had moments of ecstas y and I sang with burning sparks. I sang of the Equator , her red - feathered legs and the islands dropping out of sight. But nobod y heard. A gun fired across the Pacif ic falls into space because the earth is round and pigeons fly upside down. I saw her looking at me across the table with eyes turned to grief; sorrow spread ing inward flattened its nose against her spine; the marrow churned to pity had turned liquid. She was light as a corpse that floats in the Dead Sea. Her fingers bled with anguish and the blood turned to drool. With the wet dawn came the tolling of bells and along the fibers of m y nerves the bells pla yed ceasel essly and the ir tongues pounded in my heart and clanged with iron malice.

Slime wash and sapphires slipping, sluicing through the gay neuron s, and the spectrum spliced and the gunwales dipping. Soft as lion - pad I heard the gun carriages turn, saw them vomit and drool: the firmament sagged and all the stars turned black. Black ocean bleeding and the brooding stars breeding chunks of fresh - swollen flesh while overhead the birds wheel ed and out of the hallucinated sky fell the balanc e with mortar and pestle and the bandaged eyes of justice. All that is here related moves with imaginar y feet along the parallels of dead orbs; all that is seen with the empty sockets bursts like flowering grass. Out of nothingness arises the sign of infinity; beneath the ever - rising spirals slowl y sinks the gaping hole. The land and the water make numb ers joined, a poem written with flesh and stronger than steel or granite. Through endless night the earth whirls toward a crea tion unkno wn... Today I awoke from a sound sleep with curses of joy on my lips, with gibberish on my tongue, repeat ing to myself like a litany – \"Fay ce que vouldra s!... fay ce que vouldras!\" ; Do anything, but let it produce joy. Do anything, but let it yield ecstas y. So much crowd s into my head when I say this to myself: images, gay ones, terrib le ones, maddening ones, the wolf and the goat, the spider , the crab, syphilis with her wings outstretch ed and the door of the womb always on the latch, always open, ready like the tomb. Lust, crime, holiness: the lives of my adored ones, the failur es of my adored ones, the word s they left behind them, the words they left unfinished ; the good they dragged after them and the evil, the sorro w, the discord, the rancor , the strife they created. But above al l, the ecstasy! Things, certain things about my old idols bring the tears to my eyes: the interrupt ions, the disorder , the violen ce, above all, the hatred they aroused. When I think of their deform ities, of the monstrous styles they chose, of the flatulen ce and tediousness of their works, of all the chaos and confusion they wallowed in, of the obstacles they heaped up about them, I feel an exaltation. They were all mired in their own dung. All men who over - elabora ted. So true is it that I am almost tempted to say: \"Show me a man who over - elaborates and I will show you a great man!\" What is called their \"over - elabora tion\" is my meat: it is the sign of struggle, it is struggle itself with all the fibers clinging to it, the very aura and ambience of the discordant spirit. And when you show me a man who expresses himself perfectl y I will not say that he is not great, but I will say that I am unattracted... I miss the cloying qualit ies. When I reflect that the task which the artist implicitly sets himself is to overthrow existing values, to make of the chaos about him an order which is his own, to sow strife and ferment so that by the emotional release those who are dead may be restored to life, then it is that I run with joy to the great and imperfe ct ones, their confusion nourishe s me, their stuttering is like divine music to my ears. I see in the beautifu lly bloated pages that follow the interrup tions the erasure of petty intrusions, of the dirty footprin ts, as it were, of cowards, liars, thieves, vandals, calumniators. I see in the swollen musc les of their lyric throats the staggering effort that must be made to turn the wheel over, to pick up the pace where one has left off. I see that behind the daily annoyances and intrusions, behind the cheap, glittering malice of the feeble and inert, there stand s the symbol of life's frustrating power , and tha t he who could create order , he who would sow strife and discord, because he is imbued with will, such a man must go again and again to the stake and the gibbet.

Once I thought that to be human was the highest aim a man could have, but I see now that it was meant to destro y me. Today I am proud to say that I am inhuman, that I belong not to men and govern ments, that I have nothing to do with creeds and princip les. I have nothing to do with the creaking machinery of humanity – I belong to the earth! I say that lying on my pillow and I can feel the horns sprouting from my temples. I can see about me all those cracked forebears of mine dancing around the bed, consoling me, egging me on, lashing me with their serpent tongues, grinning and leering at me with their skulking skulls. I am inhuman! I say it with a mad, halluc inated grin, and I will keep on saying it though it rain crocodil es. Behind my words are all those grinning, leering, skulking skulls, some dead and grinn ing a long time, some grinning as if they had lockjaw , some grinning with the grimace of a grin, the foretaste and aftermath of what is always going on. Clearer than all I see my own grinning skull, see the skele ton danc ing in the wind, serpents issuing fro m the rotted tongue and the bloa ted pages of ecstas y slimed with excre ment. And I join my slime, my excre ment, my madness; my ecstas y to the great circui t which flows through the subterrane an vaults of the flesh. All this unbidden, unwanted, drunken vomit will flow on endlessl y through the minds of those to come in the inexhaust ible vessel that contains the histor y of the race. Side by side with the human race there runs another race of beings, the inhum an ones, the race of artists who, goaded by unkno wn impulses, take the lifeless mass of humanity and by the fever and ferment with which they imbue it turn this soggy dough into bread and the bread into wine and the wine into song. Out of the dead compost and the inert slag they breed a song that contaminates. I see this other race of indiv iduals ransacking the universe, turning everything upside down, their feet always moving in blood and tears, their hands always empty, always clutching and grasping for the beyond, for the god out of reach : slaying everything within reach in order to quiet the monster that gnaws at their vitals. I see that when they tear their hair with the effort to comprehend, to seize this forever unattainable, I see that when they bellow like crazed beasts and rip and gore, I see that this is right, that there is no other path to pursue. A man who belongs to this race must stand up on the high place with gibberish in his mouth and rip out his entrails. It is right and just, because he must! And anything that falls short of this frightening spect acle, anything less shuddering, less terrifying, less mad, less intox icated, less contaminating, is not art. The rest is count erfeit. The rest is human. The rest belongs to life and lifelessne ss. When I think of Stavrogin for exam ple, I think of some divine monster standing on a high plac e and fl inging to us his torn bowels. In The Possessed the ear th quakes: it is not the catastrophe that befalls the imaginative individua l, but a catac lysm in which a large portion of humanity is buried, wiped out foreve r. Stavrogin was Dostoevski and Dostoevski was the sum of all those contrad ictions which either paralyze a man or lead him to the heigh ts. There was no world too low for him to enter, no place too high for him to fear to ascend. He went the whole gamut, from the abyss to the stars. It is a pity that we shall never again have the opportuni ty to see a man placed at the very core of mystery and, by his flashes, illuminating, for us the depth and immensity of the darkness. Today I am aware of my lineage. I have no need to consult my horoscope or my genealog ical chart. What is written in the stars, or in my blood, I know nothing of.

I want rivers tha t make oceans such as Shakespeare and Dante, rivers which do not dry up in the void of the past. Oceans, yes!

Let us have more oceans, more upheav als, more wars, more holocausts. Let us have a world of men and women with dynamos betwe en their legs, a world of natural fury, of passion, action, drama, dreams, madness, a world that produces ecstas y and not dry farts. I believe that today more than ever a book should be sought after even if it has only one great page in it: we must search for fragments, splinters, toenails, anything that has ore in it, anything that is capabl e of resuscita ting the bod y and soul. It may be that we are doomed, that there is no hope for us, any of us, but if that is so then let us set up a last agonizing, bloodcurd ling howl, a screech of defianc e, a war whoop! Away with lamentation! Away with elegies and dirges! Away with biographies and histories, and libraries and museums! Let the dead eat the dead. Let us living ones dance about the rim of the crater, a last expiring dance. But a danc e! \"I love everything that flows,\" said the great blind Milton of our times. I was thinking of him this morning when I awoke with a great blood y shout of joy: I was thinking of his rivers and trees and all that world of night which he is exploring. Yes, I said to myself, I too love everything that flows: rivers, sewers, lava, semen, blood, bile, words, sentences. I love the amniotic fluid when it spills out of the bag. I love the kidne y with its painfu l gallston es, its grave l and what - not; I love the urine that pours out scalding and the clap that runs endlessl y; I love the word s of hysterics and the sentences that flow on like dysentery and mirror all the sick images of the soul; I love the great rivers like the Ama zon and the Orinoco, where crazy men like Moravag ine float on through dream and legend in an open boat and drown in the blind mouths of the river. I love everything that flows, even the menstrua l flow that carries away the seed unfecund. I love scripts that flow, be they hierat ic, esoteric, perverse, polymorph, or unilateral. I love everything that flows, everything that has time in it and becoming, that brings us back to the beginn ing where there is never end: the violenc e of the prophets, the obscenity that is ecstas y, the wisdom of the fanatic, the priest with his rubber litany, the"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"foul words of the whore, the spittle that floats away in the gutter, the milk of the breast and the bitter honey that pours from the womb, all that is fluid, melting, dissolute and dissolvent, all the pus and dirt that in flowing is purified, that loses its sense of origin, that makes the great circui t toward dea th and dissolut ion. The grea t incestuous wi sh is to flow on, one with t ime, to m erge the grea t image of the beyond with the here and now.

The fire was out and we were all so tired that we climbed into bed with our clothes on. The one I had, who had been like a bounding leopard all evening, fell sound asleep as I was climbing over her. For a while I worked over her as one works over a person who has been drowned or asphyxiated. Then I gave it up and fell sound asleep myself: All during the holida ys we had champagn e morn ing, noon and night – the cheapest and the best champagne. With the turn of the year I was to leave for Dijon where I had been offered a trivial post as exchange profes sor of English, one of those Franco- American amity arrange ments which is supposed to promote under standing and good will between sister repub lics. Fillmore was more elated than I by the prospect – he had good reason to be. For me it was just a transfer from one purgator y to another . There was no future ahead of me; there wasn't even a salary attached to the job. One was supposed to consider himself fortuna te to enjoy the privil ege of spreading the gospel of Franco-A meric an amity. It wa s a job for a rich man's son. The night before I left we had a good time. About dawn it began to snow: we walked about from one quar ter to another taking a last look at Paris. Passing through the Rue St. Dominique we suddenl y fell upon a little square and there was the Eglise Ste. - Clotilde. People were going to mass. Fillmore, whose head was still a little cloud y, was bent on going to mass too. \"For the fun of it!\" as he put it. I felt somewha t uneas y about it; in the first place I had never attended a mass, and in the second place I looked seedy and felt seedy. Fillmore, too, looked rather battered, even more disreputab le than myself; his big slouch hat was on assways and his overcoa t was still full of sawdust from the last joint we had been in. However , we marched in. The worst they could do would be to throw u s out. I was so astound ed by the sight that greeted my eyes that I lost all uneasiness. It took me a little while to get adjusted to the dim light. I stumb led around behind Fillmore, holding his sleev e. A weird, unear thly noise assailed my ears, a sort of hol low drone that rose up out of the cold flagg ing. A huge, dismal tomb it was with mourners shuffling in and out. A sort of antech amber to the world below . Temperature about 55 or 60 Fahrenheit. No music except this undefinab le dirge manufa ctured in the subcell ar – like a million heads of cauliflower wailing in the dark. People in shrouds were chewing away with that hopeless, deject ed look of beggars who hold out their hands in a trance and m umble an unintel ligible appe al. That this sort of thing existed I knew , but then one also know s that there are slaughterhouses and morgues and dissecting rooms. One instinct ively avoids such places. In the street I had often passed a priest with a little prayer book in his hands laboriousl y memorizing his lines. Idiot , I would say to myself, and let it go at that. In the street one meets with all forms of dementia and the priest is by no means the most striking. Two thousand years of it has deadened us to the idioc y of it. However , when you are suddenl y transported to the very midst of his realm, when you see the little world in which the priest functions like an alarm clock, you are apt to have entirely different sensations. For a mo ment all this slaver and twitch ing of the lips al most began to have a meaning. Something was going on, some kind of dumb show which, not rendering me wholl y stupefied, held me spellbound. All over the world, wherever there are these dim - lit"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"tombs, you have this incred ible spectacle – the same mean temperatur e, the same crepuscular glow, the same buzz and drone. All over Christendom , at certain stipula ted hours, people in black are groveling before the altar where the priest stands up with a little book in one hand and a dinner bell or atomizer in the other and mumbles to them in a langu age which, even if it were comprehensibl e, no longer conta ins a shred of meaning. Blessing them, most likely. Blessing the countr y, blessing the ruler, blessing the fire arms and th e batt leships and th e ammunition and the hand grenades. Surrounding him on the altar are little boys dressed like angels of the Lord who sing alto and soprano. Innocent lambs. All in skirts, sexless, like the priest hi mself who is u sually flat- footed and nearsighted to boot. A fine epicene caterwau ling. Sex in a jockstrap, to the tune of J - mol. I was taking it in as best I could in the dim light. Fascinating and stupef ying at the same time. All over the civilized world, I thought to myself. All over the world. Marvelous. Rain or shine, hail, sleet, snow, thunder , lightn ing, war, famine, pestil ence – makes not the slightest differen ce. Alwa ys the same mean temper ature, the same mumbo jumbo, the same high - laced shoes and the little angels of the Lord singing soprano and alto. Near the exit a little slot - box – to carry on the heaven ly work. So that God's blessing may rain down upon king and country and battleships and high explosives and tanks and airplanes, so that the worker may have more strength in his arms, strength to slaugh ter horses and cows and sheep, strength to punch holes in iron girders, strength to sew buttons on other people's pants, strength to sell carro ts and sewing machines and autom obiles, strength to exterminate insec ts and clean stables and unload garbage cans and scrub lavatories, strength to write headl ines and chop tickets in the subway. Strength... strength. All that lip chewing and horns woggling just to furnish a little strength! We were moving about from one spot to another , surve ying the scene with that clearh eadedness which comes after an all - night session. We must have made ourselves pretty conspicuous shuffling about that way with our coat collars turned up and never once crossing ourselves and never once moving our lips excep t to whisper some callous remark. Perhaps everything would have passed off without notice if Fillmore hadn't insisted on walking past the altar in the midst of the ceremony. He was looking for the exit, and he thought while he was at it, I suppose, tha t he would tak e a good squint at the holy of holies, get a close - up on it, as it were. We had gotten safely by and were marching toward a crack of light which must have been the way out when a priest sudden ly stepped out of the gloom and blocked our path. Wanted to know where we were going and what we were doing. We told him politely enough that we were looking for the exit. We said \"exit\" because at the moment we were so flabber gasted that we couldn't think of the French for exit. Without a word of response he took us firmly by the arm and, opening the door, a side door it was, he gave us a push and out we tumbled into the blind ing light of day. It happen ed so suddenl y and unexpec tedly that when we hit the sidewalk we were in a daze. We walked a few paces, blink ing our eyes, and then instinc tively we both turned round; the priest was still standing on the steps, pale as a ghost and scowling like the devil himself. He must have been sore as hell. Later , thinking back on it, I couldn't blame him for it. But at that moment, seeing him with his long skirts and the little skull cap on his craniu m, he looked so ridiculous tha t I burst out laughing. I looked at Fillmore and he began to laugh too. For a full minute we stood there laugh ing right in the poor bugger's face. He was so bewilder ed, I guess, that for a moment he didn't know what to do; suddenl y, however , he started down the steps on the"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"run, shaking his fist at us as if he were in earnest. When he swung out of the enclosure he was on the gallop. By this time some preservat ive instin ct warned me to get a move on. I grabbed Fillmore by the coat sleeve and started to run. He was saying, like an idiot: \"No, no! I won't run!\" \"Come on!\" I yelled, \"we'd better get out of here. That guy's mad clean through.\" And of f we ran, bea ting i t as fast as our legs would carr y us. On the way to Dijon, still laughing about the affair, my thoughts rever ted to a ludicrous incident, of a somewhat similar nature, which occurred during my brief sojourn in Florida. It was during the celebrat ed boom when, like thousands of others, I was caugh t with my pants down. Trying to extricate myself I got caugh t, along with a friend of mine, in the very neck of the bottle. Jacksonville, where we were marooned for about six weeks, was practi cally in a state of siege. Every bum on earth, and a lot of guys who had never been bums before, seem ed to have drifted into Jacksonvill e. The YMCA, the Salva tion Army, the firehouses and police stations, the hotels, the lodging houses, everything was full up. Complet absolut ely, and signs everywhere to that effect. The residents of Jacksonvil le had becom e so harden ed that it seemed to me as if they were walking around in coats of mail. It was the old business of food again. Food and a place to flop. Food was coming up from below in trainlo ads – oranges and grapefru it and all sorts of juicy edibles. We used to pass by the freight sheds looking for rotten fruit – but even tha t was scarce. One night, in desperation, I dragged my friend Joe to a synagogue, during the service. It was a Refor med congregat ion, and the rabbi impressed me rather favorabl y. The music got me too – that piercing lamentation of the Jews. As soon as the service was over I m arched to th e rabbi's stud y and requested an int erview with him. He rec eived me decent ly enough – until I made clear my mission. Then he grew absolutely fright ened. I had only asked him for a handou t on behalf of my friend Joe and myself. You would have thought, from the way he looked at me, that I had asked to rent the synagogue as a bowling alley. To cap it all, he suddenl y asked me pointblank if I was a Jew or not. When I answered no, he seemed perfe ctly outraged. Why, pray, had I come to a Jewish pastor for aid? I told him naive ly that I had always had more faith in the Jews than in the Gentil es. I said it modestly, as if it were one of my peculiar defects. It was the truth too. But he wasn 't a bit flattered. No, siree. He was horrifi ed. To get rid of me he wrote out a note to the Salvat ion Army people. \"That's the place for you to addres s yourself,\" he said, and brusquel y turned awa y to tend his flo ck. The Salva tion Army, of course, had nothing to offer us. If we had had a quarter apiec e we might have rented a mattress on the floor. But we hadn't a nickel betwe en us. We went to the park and stretch ed ourselves out on a bench. It was raining and so we covered ourselves with newspapers. Weren't there more than a half hour, I imagine, when a cop came along and, without a word of warning, gave us such a sound fanning that we were up and on our feet in a jiffy, and dancing a bit too, though we weren't in any mood for dancing. I felt so godda mned sore and miserabl e, so dejected, so lousy, after being whacked over the ass by that half - witted bastard, that I could have blown up the Ci ty Hall. The next morning, in order to get even with these hospitab le sons of bitches, we presented ourselves bright and early at the door of a Cathol ic priest. This time I let Joe do the talking. He was Irish and he had a bit of a brogue. He had very soft, blue eyes, too, and he could make them water a bit when he wanted to. A sister in black opened the door for us; she didn't ask us inside, however . We were to wait in the vestibule until she"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"went and called for the good father. In a few minutes he came, the good father , puffing like a locomotive. And what was it we wanted disturbing his likes at that hour of the morning? Something to eat and a place to flop, we answered innocen tly. And where did we hail from, the good father wanted to know at once. From New York. From New York, eh? Then ye'd better be gettin' back there as fast as ye kin, me lads, and without another word the big, bloa ted turn ip - faced bastard shoved th e door in our fac e. About an hour later, drifting around helplessl y like a couple of drunken schooners, we happened to pass by the rector y again. So help me God if the big, lecherous - looking turnip wasn 't backing out of the alley in a limousine! As he swung past us he blew a cloud of smoke into our eyes. As though to say – \" That for you!\" A beautifu l limousin e it was, with a couple of spare tires in the back, and the good father sitting at the wheel with a big cigar in his mouth. Must have been a Corona Corona, so fat and luscious it was. Sit ting pre tty he was, and no two wa ys about it: I couldn't see whether he had skirts on or not. I could only see the gravy trickl ing from his lips – and the big cigar with that fifty - cent aroma. All the way to Dijon I got to reminiscing about the past. I thought of all the things I might have said and done, which I hadn't said or done, in the bitter, humiliating moments when just to ask for a crust of bread is to make yourself less than a worm. Stone sober as I was, I was still smarting from those old insults and injuries. I could still feel that whack over the ass which the cop gave me in the park – though that was a mere bagate lle, a little dancing lesson, you might say. All over the States I wandered, and into Canada and Mexico. The same story everywhere. If you want bread you've got to get in harness, get in lock step. Over all the earth a gray desert, a carpet of steel and cement. Production! More nuts and bolts, more barbed wire, more dog biscuits, more lawn mowers, more ball bearings, more high explosives, more tanks, more poison gas, more soap, more toothp aste, more newspapers, more education, more church es, more librar ies, more museu ms. Forwar d! Time presses. The embryo is pushing through the neck of the womb, and there's not even a gob of spit to ease the passage. A dry, strangulat ing birth. Not a wail, not a chirp. Salut au monde! Salute of twent y - one guns bombinating from the rectum. \"I wear my hat as I please, indoors or out,\" said Walt. That was a time when you could still get a hat to fit your head. But time passes. To get a hat tha t fits now you have to walk to the el ectric cha ir. They give y ou a skull cap. A tight fit, what? But no m atter! It fits. You have to be in a strange countr y like France, walking the meridian that separat es the hemisph eres of life and death, to know what incalculable vistas yawn ahead. The body ele ctric! The democ rat ic soul! Flood tide! Holy Mother of God, what does this crap mean? The earth is parch ed and cracked. Men and women come together like brood s of vultures over a stinking carcass, to mate and fly apart again. Vultures who drop from the clouds like heavy stones. Talons and beak, that's what we are! A huge intest inal appara tus with a nose for dead meat. Forwar d! Forward without pity, withou t compassion, without love, without forgiveness. Ask no quarter and give none! More battleships, more poison gas, more high explosiv es! More gonococci! More streptococ ci! More bombing machines! More and more of it – until the whole fucking works is blown to s mithereens, and the ear th with it! Stepping off the train I knew immediately that I had made a fatal mistake. The Lycée was a little distance from the station; I walked down the main street in the early dusk of winter , feeling my way toward my destination. A light snow was falling, the trees"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"sparkled with frost. Passed a couple of huge, empty cafés that looked like dismal waiting rooms. Silent, empty gloom – that's how it impressed me. A hopeless, jerkwater town where mustard is turned out in carload lots, in vats and tuns and barre ls and pots and cute - looking l ittle jars. The first glance at the Lycée sent a shudder through me. I felt so undec ided that at the entranc e I stopped to debate whether I would go in or not. But as I hadn't the price of a return ticket there wasn 't much use debating the question. I thought for a moment of sending a wire to Fillmore, but then I was stumped to know what excuse to make. The only thing to do was to walk in with m y eyes shut. It happened that M. le Proviseur was out – his day off, so the y said. A little hunchba ck came forward and offered to escort me to the office of M. le Censeur , second in charge. I walked a little behind him, fascinat ed by the grotesque way in which he hobbled along. He was a little monster , such as can be seen on the porch of any half-assed cathedr al in Europe. The office of M. le Censeur was large and bare. I sat down in a stiff chair to wait while the hunchback darted off to search for him. I almost felt at home. The atmosphere of the place remind ed me vividl y of certain charit y bureaus back in the States where I used to sit by the hour waiting for some mealy - mouthed bastard to come and cross - examine me. Suddenl y the door opened and, with a mincing step, M. le Censeur came prancing in. It was all I could do to suppress a ti tter. He had on ju st such a frock coat as Boris u sed to wear, and over his forehead there hung a bang, a sort of spitcurl such as Smerdyakov might have worn. Grave and brittle, with a lynxlike eye, he wasted no words of cheer on me. At once he brought forth the sheets on which were written the names of the students, the hours, the classes, etc., all in a meticulous hand. He told me how much coal and wood I was allowed and after that he promptly informed me that I was at liberty to do as I pleased in my spare time. This last was the first good thing I had heard him say. It sounded so reassuring that I quickl y said a prayer for France – for the army and for the navy, the educat ional system, the bistr os, the whole godda mned wo rks. This folderol completed, he rang a little bell, whereupon the hunchback prom ptly appeared to escort me to the office of M. l'Econom e. Here the atmosphere was somwha t different. More like a freight station, with bills of lading and rubber stamps everywher e, and pasty-faced clerks scribbling away with broken pens in huge, cumberso me ledgers. My dole of coal and wood portioned out, off we marched, the hunchba ck and I, with a wheelbarrow , toward the dorm itory. I was to have a room on the top floor, in the same wing as the pions. The situat ion was taking on a humorous aspect. I didn't know what the hell to expec t next. Perhaps a spittoon. The whole thing smacked very much of preparat ion for a campaign; the only things missing were a knapsack and rifle – and a brass slug. The room assigned me was rather large, with a small stove to which was attached a crooked pipe that made an elbow just over the iron cot. A big chest for the coal and wood stood near the door. The windows gave out on a row of forlorn little houses all made of stone in which lived the groce r, the baker , the shoem aker, the butcher, etc. – all imbecilic-looking clodhoppers. I glanced over the rooftops toward the bare hills where a train was clattering. The whistle of the locomotive scream ed mournfull y and hysterically. After the hunchback had made the fire for me I inquir ed about the grub. It was not"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"quite time for dinner. I flopp ed on the bed, with my overcoat on, and pulled the covers over me. Beside me was the eterna l ricket y night table in which the piss pot is hidden away. I stood the alarm on the t able and watched the m inutes ticking of f. Into the well of the room a bluish light filtered in from the street. I listened to the trucks rattling by as I gazed vacan tly at the stove pipe, at the elbow where it was held togeth er with bits of wire. The coal chest intrigued me. Never in my life had I occupied a room with a coal chest. And never in my life had I built a fire or taught childr en. Nor, for that matter, never in my life had I worked without pay. I felt free and cha ined at the same time – like one feels just before election, when all the crooks have been nominated and you are beseeched to vote for the right man. I felt like a hired man, like a jack - of - all - trades, like a hunter , like a rover , like a galley slave, like a pedagogu e, like a worm and a louse. I was free, but my limbs were shackl ed. A democratic soul with a free meal ticket, but no power of locomotion, no voice. I felt like a jellyfish nailed to a plank. Above all, I felt hungr y. The hands were moving slowly. Still ten more minutes to kill before the fire alarm would go off. The shadows in the room deepen ed. It grew frightful ly silent, a tense stillness that tauten ed my nerves. Little dabs of snow clung to the windowpanes. Far away a locomotive gave out a shrill screa m. Then a dead silence again. The stove had commenced to glow, but there was no heat coming from it. I began to fear that I might doze off and miss the dinner . That would mean lying awake on an empty belly all night. I got panic - stricken. Just a moment before the gong went off I jump ed out of bed and, locking the door behind me, I bolted down stairs to the court yard. There I got lost. One quadrangle after another , one stairc ase after anothe r. I wandered in and out of the build ings searching frantic ally for the refectory. Passed a long line of youngsters marching in a column to God knows where; they moved along like a chain gang, with a slave driver at the head of the column. Finall y I saw an energetic - looking individu al, with a derby, heading toward me. I stopped him to ask the way to the refectory. Happened I stopped the right man. It was M. le Proviseur , and he seemed delighted to have stumbled on me. Wanted to know right away if I were comfortably settled, if there was anything more he could do for me. I told him everything was O.K. Only it was a bit chilly, I ventur ed to add. He assured me that it was rather unusual, this weather . Now and then the fogs came on and a bit of snow, and then it became unpleasan t for a while, and so on and so forth. All the while he had me by the arm, guiding me toward the refector y. He seem ed like a very decent chap. A regular guy, I thought to myself. I even went so far as to imagine that I might get chummy with him later on, that he'd invite me to his room on a bitter cold night and make a hot grog for me. I imagined all sorts of friendl y things in the few moments it requir ed to reach the door of the refectory. Here, my mind racing on at a mile a minute. he sudden ly shook hands with me and, doffing his hat, bade me good night. I was so bewildered that I tipped my hat also. It was the regul ar thing to do, I soon found out. Whenev er you pass a prof, or even M. l'Econo me, you doff the hat. Might pass the same guy a dozen times a day. Makes no differenc e. You've got to give the salut e, even though y our hat is worn out. It's the polit e thing to do. Anyway, I had found the refector y. Like an East Side clinic it was, with tiled walls, bare light, and marble-topped tables. And of course a big stove with an elbow pipe. The dinner wasn't served yet. A cripple was running in and out with dishe s and knives and forks and bottles of wine. In a corner several young men conversing animatedly. I went up to them and introdu ced myself. They gave me a most cordial recep tion. Almost too cordial, in fact. I couldn't quite make it out. In a jiffy the room began to fill up; I was"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"presented from one to the other quickl y. Then they formed a circle about me and, filling the glasses, the y began to sing... L'autr e soir l'idée m'est venue Cré nom de Zeus d'encul er un pendu; Le vent se lèv e sur la pot ence, Voilà m on pendu qui se bal ance, J'ai dû l'encu ler en sautant, Cré nom de Zeus, on est jamais conten t. Baiser dans un con trop pet it, Cré nom de Zeus, on s'écorche le vit ; Baiser dans un con trop lar ge, On ne sait pas où l'on déchar ge; Se branl er étan t bien emmerdant, Cré nom de Zeus, on est jamais conten t. With this, Quasim odo announc ed the dinner . They were a cheerfu l group, les surve illan ts. There was Kroa who belched like a pig and always let off a loud fart when he sat down to table. He could fart thirteen times in succession, they informed me. He held the record. Then there was Monsieur le Prince, an athlete who was fond of wearing a tuxedo in the evening when he went to town; he had a beautiful complexion, just like a girl, and never touch ed the wine nor read anything that might tax his brain. Next to hi m sat Peti t Paul, from the Midi, who thought of nothing but cunt all the time; he used to say every day – \"à partir de jeudi je ne parlerai plus de femmes.\" He and Monsieur le Prince were inseparabl e. Then there was Passeleau, a veritable young scallywag who was studying medicine and who borrowed right and left; he talked incessantl y of Ronsard, Villon and Rabel ais. Oppo site me sat Mollesse, agitator and organiz er of the pions , who insisted on weighing the meat to see if it wasn't short a few grams. He occupied a little room in the infirmary. His supre me enemy was Monsieur l'Econo me, which was nothing particu larly to his credit since everybody hated this individu al. For companion Mollesse had one called Le Pénibl e, a dour-look ing chap with a hawklike profile who practised the strictest econo my and acted as moneylender. He was like an engrav ing by Albrecht Dürer – a composite of all the dour, sour, morose, bitter, unfortunat e, unluck y and introspec tive devils who compose the pantheon of Germ any's medieval knights. A Jew, no doubt. At any rate, he was killed in an automobile accident shortly after my arrival, a circumstance which left me twent y - three francs to the good. With the excep tion of Renaud who sat beside me, the others have faded out of my memory; they belonged to that categor y of color less individu als who make up the world of engineers, architects, dentists, pharmacists, teach ers, etc. There was nothing to distinguish them from the clods whom they would later wipe their boots on. They were zeros in every sense of the word, ciphers who form the nucleus of a respect able and lamentable citizenry. They ate with their heads down and were always the first to clamor for a second helping. They slept soundl y and never complained; they were neither gay nor miserab le. The indifferen t ones whom Dante consigned to the vestibu le of Hell. The upper - crusters. It was the custom after dinner to go immediately to town, unless one was on duty in"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"the dormitories. In the center of town were the cafés – huge, drear y halls where the somnolent merchan ts of Dijon gathered to play cards and listen to the music. It was warm in the cafés, that is the best I can say of them. The seats were fairly comfortab le, too. And there were always a few whores about who, for a glass of beer or a cup of coffee, would sit and chew the fat with you. The music, on the other hand, was atrocious. Such music! On a winter's night, in a dirty hole like Dijon, nothing can be more harassing, more nerv-racking, than the sound of a French orchestra. Particu larly one of those lugubrious female orchestras with everything coming in squeaks and farts, with a dry, algebr aic rhythm and the hygienic consistenc y of toothpaste. A wheez ing and scraping perfor med at so many francs the hour – and the devil take the hindmost! The melancholy of it! As if old Euclid had stood up on his hind legs and swallowed prussic acid. The whole realm of Idea so thoroughl y explo ited by the reason that there is nothing left of which to make music except the empty slats of the accordion, through which the wind whistles and tears the ether to tatters. However , to speak of music in connect ion with this putpost is like dreaming of champagne when you are in the death cell. Music was the least of my worries. I didn't even think of cunt, so dismal, so chill, so barren, so gray was it all. On the way home the first night I noticed on the door of a café an inscript ion from the Gargantua. Inside the café it was like a morgue. However , forwa rd! I had plent y of time on my hands and not a sou to spend. Two or three hours of conversation al lessons a day, and that was all. And what use was it, teaching these poor bastards English? I felt sorry as hell for them. All morning plugging away on John Gilpin 's Rid e, and in the afternoon coming to me to practise a dead langu age. I though t of the good time I had wasted reading Virgil or wading through such incom prehensib le nonsense as Hermann and Doroth ea. The insanit y of it! Learn ing, the empty breadbasket! I thought of Carl who can recite Faust backwards, who never writes a book without praising the shit out of his immortal, incorruptib le Goethe. And yet he hadn't sense enough to take on a rich cunt and get himself a change of underwear . There's som ething obscene in this love of th e past which ends in breadlin es and dugouts. Something obscene about this spiritu al racket which perm its an idiot to sprinkle holy water over Big Berthas and dreadnoughts and high explosives. Every man with a bellyful of the classics is an ene my to th e human race. Here was I, suppo sedly to spread the gospel of Franco- Amer ican amity – the emissary of a corpse who, after he had plundered right and left, after he had caused untold suffering and misery, dreamed of estab lishing universal peace. Pfui! What did they expect me to talk about, I wonder ? About Leaves of Gras s, about the tariff walls, about the Declaration of Independen ce, about the latest gang war? What? Just what, I'd like to know . Well, I'll tell you – I never mentioned these things. I started right off the bat with a lesson in the psysiolog y of love. How the elephants make love – that was it! It caugh t like wildfire. After the first day there were no more empty benches. After that first lesson in English they were stand ing at the door waiting for me. We got along swell togethe r. They asked all sorts of quest ions, as though they had never learned a damned thing. I let them fire away. I taught them to ask still more ticklish questions. Ask anything! – that was my motto. I'm here as a plenipoten tiary from the realm of free spirits. I'm here to create a fever and a ferment. \"In some ways,\" says an eminent astronom er, \"the material universe appears to be passing away like a tale that is told, dissolving into nothingness like a vision.\" That seems to be the general feeling underl ying the empty breadbasket of learning. Myself, I don't believ e it. I don't believe a"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"fucking th ing these bastards tr y to shove down our throats. Between sessions, if I had no book to read, I would go upstairs to the dorm itory and chat with the pions. They were delightfu lly ignoran t of all that was going on – especia lly in the world of art. Almost as ignorant as the students themselves. It was as if I had gotten into a priva te little madhouse with no exit signs. Sometimes I snooped around under the arcades, watching the kids marching along with huge hunks of bread stuck in their dirty mugs. I was always hungr y myself, since it was impossible for me to go to breakfast which was handed out at some ungodl y hour of the morning, just when the bed was getting toasty. Huge bowls of blue coffee with chunks of white bread and no butter to go with it. For lunch, beans or lentils with bits of meat thrown in to make it look appet izing. Food fit for a chain gang, for rock breakers. Even the wine was lousy. Things were ei ther di luted or bloated. There were calories, but no cuisine. M. l'Econom e was respon sible for it all. So they said. I don't believe that, either. He was paid to keep our heads just above the water line. He didn't ask if we were suffering from piles or carbuncl es; he didn't inquire if we had delicate palates or the intest ines of wolves. Why should he? He was hired at so many grams the plate to produce so many kilowatts of energy. Everything in terms of horse power . It was all carefull y reckoned in the fat ledgers which the pasty - faced clerks scribb led in morning, noon and night. Debit and credit, with a red line down the middle of the page. Roam ing around the quadrangl e with an empty belly most of the time I got to feel slightl y mad. Like Charl es the Silly, poor devil – only I had no Odette Cham pdivers with whom to play stinkfinge r. Half the time I had to grub cigarettes from the students, and during the lessons sometimes I munched a bit of dry bread with them. As the fire was always going out on me I soon used up my allotment of wood. It was the devil's own time coaxing a little wood out of the ledger clerks. Final ly I got so riled up about it that I would go out in the street and hunt for firewood, like an Arab. Astonishing how little firewood you could pick up in the streets of Dijon. However , these little foraging expedit ions brought m e into strange precin cts. Got to know the little street na med aft er a M. Philibert Papillon – a dead musician, I believ e – where there was a cluster of whorehouses. It was always more cheerful hereabou ts; there was the smell of cooking, and wash hanging out to dry. Once in a while I caugh t a glimpse of the poor half - wits who loung ed about inside. They were better off than the poor devils in the center of town whom I used to bump into whenever I walked through a depart ment store. I did that frequen tly in order to get warm. They were doing it for the same reason, I suppose. Looking for someone to buy them a coffee. They looked a little crazy, with the cold and the loneliness. The whole town looked a bit crazy when the blue of evening settled over it. You could walk up and down the main drive any Thursda y in the week till doomsda y and never meet an expansive soul. Sixty or sevent y thousand people – perhaps more – wrapped in woolen under wear and nowhere to go and nothing to do. Turning out mustard by the carload. Female orchestras grinding out The Mer ry Widow . Silver service in the big hotels. The ducal palace rotting away, stone by stone, limb by limb. The trees screeching with frost. A ceaseless clatter of wooden shoes. The University celebr ating the death of Goethe, or the birth, I don't remember which. (Usuall y it's the deaths tha t are celebr ated.) Idiotic affair, anyway. Ever ybody yawning and stretch ing. Coming through the high drivewa y into the quadrang le a sense of abysmal futility always came over me. Outside bleak and empty; inside, bleak and empty. A scum my sterility hanging over the town, a fog of book-learn ing. Slag and cinders of the past. Around the interior courts were ranged the classrooms, little shacks such as you might"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"see in the North wood s, where the pedagogu es gave free rein to their voices. On the blackboard the futile abracadabr a which the future citizens of the republic would have to spend their lives forgetting. Once in a while the parents were received in the big recept ion room just off the drivewa y, where there were busts of the heroes of antiqui ty, such as Molière, Racin e, Corneill e, Voltair e, etc., all the scare crows whom the cabinet ministers mention with moist lips whenever an immortal is added to the waxworks. (No bust of Villon, no bust of Rabel ais, no bust of Rimbaud.) Anyway, they met here in solemn conclav e, the parents and the stuffed shirts whom the State hires to bend the minds of the young. Alwa ys this bending process, this landsc ape gardening to make the mind more attractive. And the youngsters came too, occasional ly – the little sunflowers who would soon be transpl anted from the nurser y in order to decora te the municipal grassplots. Some of them were just rubber plants easily dusted with a torn chemise. All of them jerking away for dear life in the dorm itories as soon as night came on. The dorm itories! where the red lights glowed, where the bell rang like a fire alarm, where the tre ads were hollowed out in the scram ble to rea ch the educat ion cel ls. Then there were the profs! During the first few days I got so far as to shake hands with a few of them, and of course there was always the salute with the hat when we passed under the arcades. But as for a heart - to - heart talk, as for walking to the corner and having a drink together, nothing doing. It was simply unimaginabl e. Most of them looked as though they had had the shit scared out of them. Anyway, I belonged to another hierar chy. They wouldn't even share a louse with the likes of me. They made me so damned irritated, just to look at them, that I used to curse them under my breath when I saw them coming. I used to stand there, leaning against a pillar, with a cigare tte in the corner of my mouth and my hat down over my eyes, and when they got within hailing distance I would let squirt a good gob and up with the hat. I didn't even bother to open my trap and bid them the time of the day. Under my breath I simply said: \"Fuck you, Jack!\" and le t it go at tha t. After a week it seemed as if I had been here all my life. It was like a blood y, fucking night mare that you can't throw off. Used to fall into a coma think ing about it. Just a few days ago I had arrived. Nightfal l. People scurr ying home like rats under the foggy lights. The trees glittering with diamond - point ed malice. I thought it all out, a thousand times or more. From the station to the Lycée it was like a prom enade through the Danzig Corridor , all deckle - edged, crann ied, nerve - ridden. A lane of dead bones, of crooked, cring ing figures buried in shrouds. Spines made of sardin e bones. The Lycée itself seemed to rise up out of a lake of thin snow, an inver ted mounta in that point ed down toward the center of the earth where God or the Devil works always in a straitjacke t grinding grist for that paradise which is always a wet dream. If the sun ever shone I don't remember it. I remember nothing but the cold greas y fogs that blew in from the frozen marshes over yonder where the railroad tracks burrowed into the lurid hills. Down near the station was a canal, or perhaps it was a river, hidden away under a yellow sky, with little shacks pasted slap up against the rising edge of the banks. There was a barracks too somewhere, it struck me, because every now and then I met little yellow men from Cochin - China – squir my, opium - faced runts peeping out of their baggy unifor ms like dyed skeletons packed in excelsior. The whole godda mned medievalism of the place was infernal ly ticklish and restive, rock ing back and forth with low moans, jump ing out at you from the eaves, hanging like broken - necked criminals from the gargoyles. I kept looking back all the time, kept walking like a crab that you prong with a dirty fork.

The whole façade of St. Michel seem ed to open up like an album at night, leaving you face to face with the horrors of the printed page. When the lights went out and the chara cters faded away flat, dead as words, then it was quite magnificent, the façade; in every crevice of the old gnarled front there was the hollow chant of the nightwind and over the lacy rubble of cold stiff vestments there was a cloud y absinth e - like drool of fog and fro st. Here, where the church stood, everything seemed turned hind side front. The church itself must have been twisted off its base by centur ies of progress in the rain and snow . It lay in the Place Edgar - Quinet, squat against the wind, like a dead mule. Through the Rue de la Monnaie the wind rushed l ike white hair streaming wild: it whirled around the white hitching posts which obstructed the free passage of omnibuses and twent y - mule teams. Swinging through this exit in the early morning hours I sometimes stumb led upon Monsieur Renaud who, wrapped in his cowl like a gluttonous monk, made overtures to me in the languag e of the sixteenth centur y. Falling in step with Monsieur Renaud, the moon busting through the greas y sky like a punctured balloon, I fell immediately into the realm of the transcendent al. M. Renaud had a precise speech, dry as apricots, with a heavy Brandenbur ger base. Used to come at me full tilt from Goethe or Fichte, with deep base notes that rumbled in the wind y corners of the Place like claps of last year's thunder . Men of Yucatan, men of Zanzibar, men of Tierra del Fuego, save me from this glaucous hog rind! The North piles up about me, the glacial fjords, the blue-t ipped spines, the crazy lights, the obscene Christian chant that spread like an avalan che from Etna to the Aegean. Everything frozen tight as scum , the mind locked and rimed with frost, and through the melancho ly bales of chitter - wit the choking gargle of louse - eaten saints. White I am and wrapped in wool, swaddl ed, fettered, hamstrung, but in this I have no part. White to the bone, but with a cold alkali base, with saffron- tipped fingers. White, aye, but no brother of learning, no Catholic heart. White and ruthless, as the men before me who sailed out of the Elbe. I look to the sea, to the sky, to what is uninte lligible and distan tly near. The snow under foot scurries before the wind, blows, tickles, stings, lisps away, whirls alof t, showers, splin ters, sprays down. No sun, no roar of surf, no breaker's sur ge. The cold north wind point ed with barbed shafts, icy, malevolen t, greed y, blight ing, paral yzing. The streets turn away on their crooked elbows; they break from the hurried sight, the stern glance. They hobble away down the drifting lattice work, wheeling the church hind side front, mowing down the statues, flattening the monuments, uprooting the trees, stiffening the grass, sucking the fragrance out of the earth. Leaves dull as cement: leaves no dew can bring to glisten again. No moon will ever silver their listless plight. The seasons are come to a stagnant stop, the trees blench and wither , the wagon s roll in the mica ruts with slither ing harplike thuds. In the hollow of the white - tipped hills, lurid and boneless Dijon slumbers. No man alive and walking through the night except the restless spirits moving southward toward the sapphire grids. Yet I am up and about, a walking ghost, a white man terroriz ed by the cold sanity of this slaughterhouse geom etry. Who am I? What am I doing here? I fall between the cold walls of human malevolence, a white figure fluttering, sinking down through the cold lake, a moun tain of skulls above me. I settle down to the cold latitudes, the chalk steps washed with indigo. The earth in its dark corridors knows my step, feels a foot abroad, a wing stirring, a gasp and a shudder .

All things come to me through the clear fog with the odor of repeti tion, with yellow hangovers and Gadzooks and whettikins. In the dead center , far below Dijon, far below the hyperbor ean regions, stand s God Ajax, his shoulders strapped to the mill wheel, the olives crunching, the green marsh water alive with croaking frogs. The fog and snow, the cold latitude, the heavy learning, the blue coffee, the unbuttered bread, th e soup and lent ils, the heav y pork - packer beans, the stal e cheese, the soggy chow , the lousy wine have put the whole penitentiary into a state of constipa tion. And just when everyone has become shit - tight the toilet pipes freeze. The shit piles up like ant hills; one has to move down from the little pedestals and leave it on the floor. It lies there stiff and frozen, waiting for the thaw. On Thursdays the hunchback comes with his little wheelbarrow , shovels the cold, stiff turds with a broom and pan, and trundles off dragging his withered leg. The corridors are littered with toilet paper; it sticks to y our feet like flypaper. When the weather moderates the odor gets ripe; you can smell it in Winchester forty miles away. Standing over that ripe dung in the morning, with a toothbrush, the stench is so powerful that it makes your head spin. We stand around in red flanne l shirts, waiting to spit down the hole; it is like an aria from one of Verdi's great operas – an anvil chorus with pulleys and syringes. In the night, when I am taken short, I rush down to the priva te toilet of M. le Censeur , just off the drivewa y. My stool is always full of blood. His toilet doesn't flush either but at least there is the pleasure of sitting down. I le ave m y little bundle for hi m as a token of esteem. Toward the end of the meal each evening the veil leur de nui t drops in for his bit of cheer . This is the only human being in the whole institution with whom I feel a kinship. He is a nobod y. He carries a lantern and a bunch of keys. He makes the rounds through the night, stiff as an automaton. About the time the stale cheese is being passed around, in he pops for his glass of wine. He stands there, with paw outstretch ed, his hair stiff and wiry, like a mastiff's, his cheeks ruddy, his mustach e gleaming with snow. He mumbles a word or two and Quasimodo brings him the bottle. Then, with feet solidl y planted, he throws back his head and down it goes, slowl y in one long draught. To me it's like he's pouring rubies down his gullet. Something about this gesture which seizes me by the hair. It's almost as if he were drinking down the dregs of human sympathy, as if all the love and compassion in the world could be tossed off like that, in one gulp – as if that were all that could be squeezed together day after day. A little less than a rabbi t they have made him. In the schem e of things he's not worth the brine to pickle a herring. He's just a piece of live manure. And he know s it. When he looks around after his drink and smiles at us, the world seems to be falling to pieces. It's a smile thrown across an abyss. The whole stinking civilized world lies like a quagmire at the botto m of the pit, and over it, like a mirage, hovers this wavering smile. It was the same smile which greeted me at night when I returned from my rambles. I remember one such night when, stand ing at the door waiting for the old fellow to finish his round s, I had such a sense of well - being that I could have waited thus foreve r. I had to wait perhaps half an hour before he opened the door. I looked about me calmly and leisurel y, drank everything in, the dead tree in front of the school with its twisted rope branches, the houses across the street which had changed color during the night, which curved now more noticeably, the sound of a train rolling through the Siberian wastes,"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"the railings painted by Utrillo, the sky, the deep wagon ruts. Suddenl y, out of nowhere, two lovers appear ed; every few yards they stopped and embraced, and when I could no longer follow them with my eyes I followed the sound of their steps, heard the abrupt stop, and then the slow, meandering gait. I could feel the sag and slump of their bodies when they leaned against a rail, heard their shoes creak as the musc les tightened for the embrace. Through the town they wandered, through the crooked streets, toward the glass y canal where the water lay black as coal. There was something pheno menal about it. In a ll Dijon not two lik e them. Meanwhile the old fellow was making the rounds; I could hear the jingle of his keys, the crunching of his boots, the stead y, automatic tread. Finall y I heard him coming through the drivewa y to open the big door, a monstrous, arched portal without a moat in front of it. I heard him fumbling at the lock, his hands stiff, his mind numbed. As the door swung open I saw over his head a brilliant constel lation crowning the chapel. Every door was locked, every cell bolted. The books were closed. The night hung close, dagger -pointed, drunk as a maniac. There it was, the infini tude of emptiness. Over the chapel, like a bishop 's miter, hung the constel lation, every night, during the winter months, it hung there low over the chape l. Low and bright, a handful of dagger points, a dazzl e of pure emptiness. The old fellow followed me to the turn of the drive. The door closed silently. As I bade him good night I caugh t that desperat e, hopeless smile again, like a meteoric flash over the rim of a lost world. And again I saw him standing in the refector y, his head thrown back and the rubies pouring down his gullet. The whole Mediterran ean seemed to be buried inside him – the orange groves, the cypress trees, the winged statues, the wooden temples, the blue sea, the stiff masks, the mystic numbers, the mythologi cal birds, the sapphire skies, the eaglets, the sunny coves, the blind bards, the beard ed heroes. Gone all that. Sunk beneath the avalanch e from the North. Buried, dead forever . A memory. A wild hope. For just a moment I linger at the carriagewa y. The shroud, the pall, the unspeakabl e, clutch ing emptiness of it all. Then I walk quick ly along the gravel path near the wall, past the arches and columns, the iron staircases, from one quadrangl e to the other. Everything is locked tight. Locked for the winter . I find the arcade leading to the dorm itory. A sickish light spills down over the stairs from the grimy, frosted windows. Everywhere the paint is peeling off. The stones are hollowed out, the banist er creaks; a damp sweat oozes from the flagg ing and forms a pale, fuzzy aura pierced by the feeble red light at the head of the stairs. I mount the last flight, the turret, in a sweat and terror. In pitch darkness I grope my way through the deserted corridor , every room empty, locked, molding away. My hand slides along the wall seeking the keyhole. A panic comes over me as I grasp the doorknob. Alwa ys a hand at my collar ready to yank me back. Once insid e the room I bolt the door . It's a miracle which I perform each night, the miracle of getting inside withou t being strangled, without being struck down by an ax. I can hear the rats scurr ying through the corrido r, gnawing away over my head between the thick rafters. The light glares like burning sulfur and there is the sweet, sickish stench of a room which is never ventilated. In the corner stands the coal box, just as I left it. The fire is out. A silenc e so intense that it sounds like Niagara Falls in m y ears. Alone, with a tremendous e mpty long ing and dread. The whole roo m for m y thoughts. Nothing but myself and what I think, what I fear. Could think the most fantastic thoughts, could dance, spit, grimace, curse, wail – nobod y would ever know , nobod y would ever hear.

Over steel and iron beds they roll, the ground sown with slag and cinders and purple ore. In the baggage cars, kelps, fishplat e, rolled iron, sleepers, wire rods, plates and sheets, laminated articles, hot rolled hoops, splints and mortar carriages, and Zorès ore.

The door of the womb always on the latch. Dread and longing. Deep in the blood the pull of paradise. The beyond. Always the beyond. It must have all started with the navel. They cut the umbilical cord, give you a slap on the ass, and presto! you're out in the world, adrif t, a ship without a rudde r. You look at the stars and then you look at your navel. You grow eyes everywhere – in the armpits, between the lips, in the roots of your hair, on the soles of your feet. What is distant becomes near, what is near becomes distant. Inner -outer , a constant flux, a shedding of skins, a turning inside out.

A telegram from Carl informed me one day that there was a vacanc y \"upstairs\"; he said he would send me the fare back if I decided to accep t. I telegraphed back at once and as soon as the dough arrived I beat i t to the station. Not a word to M. le Proviseur or an yone. French leave, as the y say. I went immediately to the hotel at 1 bis , where Carl was staying. He came to the door stark naked. It was his night off and there was a cunt in the bed as usual. \"Don't mind her,\" he says, \"she's asleep. If you need a lay you can take her on. She's not bad.\" He pulls the covers back to show me what she looks like. However , I wasn 't think ing about a lay right away. I was too excited. I was like a man who has just escaped from jail. I just wanted to see and hear things. Coming from the station it was like a long dream . I felt as though I had been away for y ears. It was not until I had sat down and taken a good look at the room that I realized I was back again in Paris. It was Carl's room and no mistake about it. Like a squirrel cage and shithouse combin ed. There was hardl y room on the table for the portable machine he used. It was always like that, whether he had a cunt with him or not. Always a dictionar y lying open on a gilt - edged volum e of Faust, always a tobacco pouch, a beret, a bottle of vin rouge, letters, manuscripts, old newspapers, water colors, teapot, dirty socks, toothpicks, Kruschen Salts, condo ms, etc. In the bide t were orange peels and the remnants of a ham sandwich. \"There's some food in the closet\" he said. \"Help yourself! I was just going to give myself an injection.\" I found the sandwich he wa s talking about and a piece of cheese th at he had nibbled at beside it. While he sat on the edge of the bed, dosing himself with his argyrol, I put away the sandwich and cheese with the aid of a l ittle wine. \"I liked that letter you sent me about Goethe,\" he said, wiping his prick with a dirty pair of drawers. \"I'll show you the answer to it in a minute – I'm putting it in my book. The troub le with you is that you're not a German. You have to be German to understand Goethe. Shit, I'm not going to explain it to you now. I've put it all in the book... By the way, I've got a new cunt now – not this one – this one's a half - wit. At least, I had her until a few days ago. I'm not sure whether she'll come back or not. She was living with me all the time you were away. The other day her parents came and took her away. They said she was only fifteen. Can y ou beat that? They scared the shit out of m e too...\" I began to laugh. It was lik e Carl to get hims elf in to a m ess lik e that. \"What are you laughing for?\" he said. \"I may go to prison for it.

She al most wore m e out.\" By this time the one in bed had come to and was rubbing her eyes. She looked pretty young to me, too. Not bad looking but dumb as hell. Wanted to know right away what we were talk ing about. \"She lives here in the hotel,\" said Carl. \"On the third floor. Do you want to go to her room? I'll fix it up for y ou.\" I didn't know whether I wanted to or not, but when I saw Carl mush ing it up with her again I decided I did want to. I asked her first if she was too tired. Useless quest ion. A whore is never too tired to open her legs. Some of them can fall asleep while you diddle them. Anyway, it was decid ed we would go down to her room. Like that I wouldn't have to pay the patron for the night. In the morning I rented a room overlooking the little park down below where the sandwich- board men always came to eat their lunch. At noon I called for Carl to have breakfast with him. He and Van Norden had developed a new habit in my absence – they went to the Coupole for breakfast every day. \"Why the Coupole ?\" I asked. \"Why the Coupole?\" sa ys Carl. \"Bec ause the Coupole serves porridge at all hours and porridge makes y ou shit.\" – \"I see,\" said I. So it's just like it used to be again. The three of us walking back and forth to work. Petty dissensions, petty rivalr ies. Van Norden still bellyaching about his cunts and about washing the dirt out of his belly. Only now he's found a new diversion. He's found that it's less annoying to masturbat e. I was amazed when he broke the news to me. I didn't think it possible for a guy like that to find any pleasure in jerking himself off. I was still more amazed when he expla ined to me how he goes about it. He had \"invented\" a new stunt, so he put it. \"You take an apple,\" he says, \"and you bore out the core.

I think he's nuts. Anyway, that's what his girl told me. He took on a French girl, you know , while you were away. They used to fight like hell. She's a big, healthy bitch – wild like. I wouldn't mind giving her a tumble, but I'm afraid she'd claw the eyes out of me. He was always going around with his face and hands scratched up. She looks bunged up too once in a while – or she used to. You know how these French cunts are – when they love they lose their minds.\" Eviden tly things had happened while I was away. I was sorry to hear about Fillmore. He had been damned good to me. When I left Van Norden I jumped a bus and went straight to the hospital. They hadn't decided yet whether he was completely off his base or not, I suppo se, for I found him upstairs in a priva te room , enjoying all the liberties of the regul ar patien ts. He had just come from the bath when I arrived. When he caught sight of me he burst into tears. \"It's all over,\" he says immediately. \"They say I'm crazy – and I may have syphilis too. They say I have delusions of grandeu r.\" He fell over onto the bed and wept quietly. After he had wept a while he lifted his head up and smiled – just like a bird coming out of a snooze. \"Why do they put me in such an expensive room?\" he said. \"Why don't they put me in the ward – or in the bughouse ? I can't afford to pay for this. I'm down to my last five hundred dollars.\" \"That's why they're keeping you here,\" I said. \"They'll transfer you quickl y enough when your money runs out. Don't worr y.\" My word s must have impressed him, for I had no sooner finished than he handed me his watch and chain, his walle t, his fratern ity pin, etc. \"Hold on to them,\" he said. \"These bastards'll rob me of everything I've got.\" And then suddenl y he began to laugh, one of those weird, mirthless laughs which makes you believe a guy's goofy whether he is or not. \"I know you'll think I'm crazy,\" he said, \"but I want to atone for what I did. I want to get married. You see, I didn't know I had the clap. I gave her the clap and then I knocked her up. I told the doctor I don't care what happens to me, but I want him to let me get married first. He keeps telling me to wait until I get better but I know I'm never going to ge t bett er. This is the end.\" I couldn't help laughing myself, hearing him talk that way. I couldn't understand what had come over him. Anyway, I had to prom ise him to see the girl and explain things to her. He wanted me to stick by her, comfort her. Said he could trust me, etc. I said yes to everything in order to soothe him. He didn't seem exactly nuts to me – just caved - in like. Typical Anglo - Saxon crisis. An eruption of morals. I was rather curious to see the girl, to get the lowdown on the whole th ing. The next day I looked her up. She was living in the Latin Quarter. As soon as she realized who I was she became exceed ingly cordial. Ginette she called herself. Rather big, raw-boned, healthy, peasant type with a front tooth half eaten away. Full of vitality and a kind of crazy fire in her eyes. The first thing she did was to weep. Then, seeing that I was an old friend of her Jo - Jo – that was how she called him – she ran downsta irs and brought back a couple of bottles of white wine. I was to stay and have dinner with her – she insisted on it. As she drank she beca me by turns ga y and ma udlin. I didn't have to ask her any questions – she went on like a self-winding machine. The thing that worried her princ ipally was – would he get his job back when he was released from the hospital? She said her paren ts were well off, but they were displeased with her. They didn't approve of her wild ways. They didn't approve of him particu larly – he had no"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"manners, and he was an Amer ican. She begged me to assure her that he would get his job back, which I did without hesita tion. And then she begged me to know if she could believ e what he said – that he was going to marry her. Because now, with a child under her belt, and a dose of clap besides, she was in no position to strike a match – with a Frenchm an anyway. That was clear, wasn't it? Of course, I assured her. It was all clear as hell to me – excep t how in Christ' s name Fillmore had ever fallen for her. Howeve r, one thing at a time. It was my duty now to comfort her, and so I just filled her up with a lot of baloney, told her everything would turn out all right and that I would stand godfather to the child, etc. Then suddenl y it struck me as strange that she should have the child at all – espec ially as it was likely to be born blind. I told her that as tactfully as I could. \"It doesn 't make an y difference,\" she said, \"I want a child b y him.\" \"Even if it's blind?\" I a sked. \"Mon Dieu, ne dites pas ça!\" she groaned. \"Ne dites pa s ça!\" Just the same, I felt it was m y duty to say it. She got hysterical and began to weep like a walrus, poured out more wine. In a few moments she was laughing boisterousl y. She was laugh ing to think how the y used to fight when the y got in bed. \"He liked me to fight with hi m,\" she said. \"He wa s a brute.\" As we sat down to eat, a friend of hers walked in – a little tart who lived at the end of the hall. Ginet te immediately sent me down to get some more wine. When I came back they had evident ly had a good talk. Her friend, Yvette, worked in the police depar tment. A sort of stool pigeon, as far as I could gather. At least that was what she was trying to make me believe. It was fairly obvious that she was just a little whore. But she had an obsession about the police and their doings. Throughout the meal they were urging me to accompan y them to a bat musett e. They wanted to have a gay time – it was so lonel y for Ginet te with Jo - Jo in the hospital. I told them I had to work, but that on my night off I'd come back and take them out. I made it clear too that I had no dough to spend on them. Ginet te, who was really thunderstruck to hear this, pretended that that didn't matter in the least. In fact, just to show what a good sport she was, she insisted on driving me to work in a cab. She was doing it because I was a friend of Jo - Jo's. And therefore I was a friend of hers. \"And also,\" thought I to myself, \"if anything goes wrong with your Jo - Jo you'll come to me on the double - quick. Then you'll see what a friend I can be!\" I was as nice as pie to her. In fact when we got out of the cab in front of the office, I permitted them to persuade me into having a final Pernod togethe r. Yvette wanted to know if she couldn't call for me after work. She had a lot of things to tell me in confidence, she said. But I managed to refuse without hurting her feelings. Unfortun ately I did unbend sufficiently to give her m y address. Unfortuna tely, I say. As a matter of fact, I'm rather glad of it when I think back on it. Because the very next day things began to happen. The very next day, before I had even gotten out of bed, the two of them called on me. Jo - Jo had been removed from the hospital – they had incarcer ated him in a little château in the countr y, just a few miles out of Paris. The chât eau, they called it. A polite way of saying \"the bughouse.\" They wanted m e to get dressed immediately and go with the m. They were in a panic. Perhaps I might have gone alone – but I just couldn't make up my mind to go with these two. I asked them to wait for me down stairs while I got dressed, thinking that it would give me time to invent some excuse for not going. But they wouldn't leave the room . They sat there and watched me wash and dress, just as if it were an everyday affair. In the midst of it, Carl popped in. I gave him the situation briefl y in English, and"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"then we hatched up an excuse that I had some importan t work to do. Howeve r, to smoo th things over , we got some wine in and we began to amuse them by showing them a book of dirty drawings. Yvette had already lost all desire to go to the château. She and Carl were getting along famousl y. When it came time to go Carl decided to accompany them to the château. He though t it would be funny to see Fillmore walking around with a lot of nuts. He wanted to see what it was like in the nuthouse. So off they went, somewha t pick led, and in the best of hum or. All the time that Fillmore was at the château I never once went to see him. It wasn 't necessar y, because Ginett e visited him regularl y and gave me all the news. They had hopes of bringing him around in a few months, so she said. They thought it was alcohol ic poisoning – nothing more. Of course, he had a dose – but that wasn't difficult to remedy. So far as they could see, he didn't have syphilis. That was something. So, to begin with, they used the stomach pump on him. They cleaned his system out thoroughl y. He was so weak for a while that he couldn't get out of bed. He was depressed, too. He said he didn't want to be cured – he wanted to die. And he kept repeat ing this nonsense so insistent ly that finally they grew alarmed. I suppose it wouldn't have been a very good recommendation if he had committed suicide. Anyway, they began to give him mental treatment. And in between times they pulled out his teeth, more and more of them, until he didn't have a tooth left in his head. He was supposed to feel fine after that, yet strangel y he didn't. He became more despondent than ever. And then his hair began to fall out. Finall y he developed a parano id streak – began to accuse them of all sorts of things, demanded to know by what right he was being detained, what he had done to warrant being locked up, etc. After a terrib le fit of despondenc y he would suddenl y become energetic and threaten to blow up the place if they didn't release him. And to make it worse, as far as Ginett e was concerned, he had gotten all over his notion of marrying her. He told her straight up and down that he had no intention of marrying her, and that if she was crazy enough to go and have a child then she could support it herself. The doctors interpre ted all this as a good sign. They said he was coming round. Ginette, of course, thought he was crazier than ever, but she was praying for him to be released so that she could take him to the countr y where it would be quiet and peaceful and where he would come to his right senses. Meanwhile her parents had come to Paris on a visit and had even gone so far as to visit the future son - in - law at the châte au. In their canny way they had probab ly figured it out that it would be better for their daughter to have a crazy husband than no husband at all. The father thought he could find something for Fillmore to do on the farm. He said that Fillmore wasn't such a bad chap at all. When he learned from Ginette that Fillmore's paren ts had money he became even m ore indulgen t, more understanding. The thing was working itself out nicely all around. Ginet te return ed to the provinces for a while with her paren ts. Yvette was coming regularl y to the hotel to see Carl. She thought he was the editor of the paper . And little by little she became more confident ial. When she got good and tight one day, she inform ed us that Ginette had never been anything but a whore, that Ginette was a bloodsucker , that Ginette never had been pregnant and was not pregnant now. About the other accusa tions we hadn't much doubt, Carl and I, but about not being pregnan t, that we weren't so sure of. \"How did she get such a big sto mach, then?\" asked Carl. Yvette laughed. \"Maybe she uses a bicycle pump,\" she said. \"No, seriousl y,\" she"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"added, \"the stomach comes from drink. She drinks like a fish, Ginett e. When she comes back from the countr y, you will see, she will be blown up still more. Her father is a drunkard. Ginett e is a drunkard. Maybe she had the clap, y es – but she is not pregnant.\" \"But wh y does s he want to m arry him? Is she rea lly in love with him?\" \" Love? Pfooh! She has no heart, Ginette. She wants someone to look after her. No Frenchm an would ever marry her – she has a police record. No, she wants him because he's too stupid to find out about her. Her paren ts don't want her any more – she's a disgrace to them. But if she can get married to a rich American, then everything will be all right... You think maybe she loves him a little, eh? You don't know her. When they were living togeth er at the hote l, she had m en coming to her roo m while he was at work. She said he didn't give her enough spending money. He was stingy. That fur she wore – she told hi m her paren ts had given it to her, didn't she? Innocen t fool! Why, I've seen her bring a man back to the hotel right while he was there. She brought the man to the floor below . I saw it with my own eyes. And what a man! An old derelic t. He couldn't get an erection!\" If Fillmore, when he was released from the châte au, had return ed to Paris, perhaps I might have tipped him off about his Ginet te. While he was still under observat ion I didn't think it well to upset him by poisoning his mind with Yvette's slanders. As things turned out, he went directly from the château to the home of Ginette's parents. There, despite himself, he was inveigled into making public his engag ement. The banns were published in the local papers and a recep tion was given to the friends of the family. Fillmore took advan tage of the situation to indulge in all sorts of escapades. Though he knew quite well what he was doing he pretended to be still a little daffy. He would borro w his father - in - law's car, for example, and tear about the countr yside all by himself; if he saw a town that he liked he would plank himself down and have a good time until Ginett e came search ing for him. Sometimes the father - in - law and he would go of f together – on a fishing trip, presum ably – and nothing would be heard of them for days. He became exasper atingly capric ious and exacting. I suppose he figured he might as well get what he could out of it. When he returned to Paris with Ginett e he had a complete new wardrobe and a pocketful of dough. He looked cheerfu l and healthy, and had a fine coat of tan. He looked sound as a berry to me. But as soon as we had gotten away from Ginette he opened up. His job was gone and his money had all run out. In a month or so they were to be married. Meanwhi le the parents were supplying the dough. \"Once they've got me properl y in their clutches,\" he said, \"I'll be nothing but a slave to the m. The father thinks he's going to open up a stationer y store for me. Ginette will handl e the custom ers, take in the money, etc., while I sit in the back of the store and write – or something. Can you picture me sitting in the back of a stationer y store for the rest of my life? Ginett e thinks it's an excellent idea. She likes to handle money. I'd rather go back to the château than submit to such a schem e.\" For the time being, of course, he was pretend ing that everything was hunk y - dory. I tried to persuade him to go back to Amer ica but he wouldn't hear of that. He said he wasn't going to be driven out of France by a lot of ignorant peasants. He had an ide a that he would slip out of sight for a while and then take up quarters in some outlying section of the city where he'd not be likely to stumb le upon her. But we soon decid ed that that was impossible: you can't hide away in France as you can in America. \"You cou ld go to Belg ium for a while,\" I suggested."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"\"But what'll I do for money?\" he said prom ptly. \"You can't get a job in these goddam ned countries.\" \"Why don't y ou marry her and get a divorce, then?\" I asked. \"And m eanwhile she'll be dropping a kid. Who's going to tak e care of the kid, eh?\" \"How do you know she's going to have a kid?\" I said, determined now that the moment had co me to spil l the beans. \"How do I know ?\" he said. He didn't quite seem to know what I was insinuat ing. I gave him an inkling of what Yvette had said. He listened to me in complete bewilder ment. Finall y he interrup ted me. \"It's no use going on with that,\" he said. \"I know she's going to have a kid, all right. I've felt it kicking around inside. Yvette's a dirty little slut. You see, I didn't want to tell you, but up until the time I went to the hospital I was shelling out for Yvette too. Then when the crash came I couldn't do any more for her. I figured out that I had done enough for the both of them... I made up my mind to look after myself first. That made Yvette sore. She told Ginet te that she was going to get even with me... No, I wish it were true, what she said. Then I could get out of this thing more easily. Now I'm in a trap. I've promised to marry her and I'll have to go through with it. After that I don't know what'll happen to me. They've got me by the balls now .\" Since he had taken a room in the same hotel with me I was oblig ed to see them frequentl y, whether I wanted to or not. Almost every evening I had dinner with them, preceded, of course, by a few Pernods. All through the meal they quarre led noisil y. It was embarrassing because I had sometimes to take one side and sometimes the other. One Sunda y afternoon, for exam ple, after we had had lunch togethe r, we repair ed to a café on the corner of the Boulev ard Edgar - Quinet. Things had gone unusual ly well this time. We were sitting inside at a little table, one alongside the other , our backs to a mirror. Ginett e must have been passionat e or som ething for she had suddenl y gotten in to a sentimental mood and was fondling him and kissing him in front of everybody, as the French do so natural ly. They had just come out of a long embra ce when Fillmore said something about her parents which she interpreted as an insult. Immediately her cheeks flushed with anger. We tried to mollify her by telling her that she had misunderstood the remark and then, under his breath, Fillmore said something to me in English – something about giving her a little soft soap. That was enough to set her completely off the handle. She said we were making fun of her. I said something sharp to her which angered her still more and then Fillmore tried to put in a word. \"You're too quick- temper ed,\" he said, and he tried to pat her on the cheek. But she, thinking that he had raised his hand to slap her face, she gave him a sound crack in the jaw with that big peasant hand of hers. For a moment he was stunned. He hadn't expec ted a wallop like that, and it stung. I saw his face go white and the next moment he raised himself from the bench and with the palm of his hand he gave her such a crack that she almost fell off her seat. \"There! that'll teach you how to behave!\" he said – in his broken French. For a moment there was a dead silence. Then, like a storm breaking, she picked up the cognac glass in front of her and hurled it at him with all her might. It smashed against the mirror behind us. Fillmore had alread y grabbed her by the arm, but with her free hand she grabbed the coffee glass and smashed it on the floor. She was squir ming around like a maniac. It was al l we could do to hold he r. Mean while, of course, the patr on had come running in and ordered us to beat it. \"Loafers!\" he called us. \"Yes, loafers; that's it!\" screa med Ginet te. \"Dirt y foreigners! Thugs! Gangsters! Striking a pregnan t woman!\""},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"We were getting black looks all around. A poor Frenchwo man with two American toughs. Gang sters. I was wondering how the hell we'd ever get out of the place without a fight. Fillmore, by this time, was as silen t as a clam. Ginet te was bolting it through the door, leaving us to face the music. As she sailed out she turned back with fist upraised and shouted ; \"I'll pay you back for this, you brute! You'll see! No foreigner can treat a decent Frenchwom an like tha t! Ah, no! Not lik e that!\" Hearing this the patr on, who had now been paid for his drinks and his broken glasses, felt it incumbent to show his gallan try toward a splend id represent ative of French motherhood such as Ginett e, and so, without more ado, he spat at our feet and shoved us out of the door . \"Shit on you, you dirty loafers!\" he said, or som e such ple asantr y. Once in the street and nobod y throwing things after us, I began to see the funny side of it. It would be an excellent idea, I thought to myself, if the whole thing were properl y sired in court. The whole thing! With Yvette's little stories as a side dish. After all, the French have a sense of humo r. Perhaps the judge, when he heard Fillmore's side of the story, would absolve hi m from marriage. Meanwhile Ginett e was standing across the street brandishing her fist and yelling at the top of her lungs. People were stopping to listen in, to take sides, as they do in street brawls. Fillmore didn't know what to do – whether to walk away from her, or to go over to her and try to pacif y her. He was standing in the middle of the street with his arms outstretch ed, trying to get a word in edgewise. And Ginette still yelling: \"Gangster! Brute! Tu verras, salaud!\" and other complimentary things. Finall y Fillmore made a move toward her and she, probabl y thinking that he was going to give her another good cuff, took it on a trot down the street. Fillmore came back to where I was standing and said: \"Com e on, let's follow her quietly.\" We started off with a thin crowd of straggl ers behind us. Every once in a while she turned back toward us and brandished her fist. We made no attempt to catch up with her, just followed her leisurel y down the street to see what she would do. Finall y she slowed up her pace and we crossed over to the other side of the street. She was quiet now. We kept walking behind her, getting closer and close r. There were only about a dozen peopl e behind us now – the others had lost interest. When we got near the corner she suddenl y stopped and waited for us to approach. \"Let me do the talking,\" said Fil lmore, \"I kno w how to hand le her .\" The tears were streaming down her face as we came up to her. Myself, I didn't know what to expect of her. I was somewha t surprised therefor e when Fillmore walked up to her and said in an aggrieved voice: \"Was that a nice thing to do? Why did you act that way?\" Whereupon she threw her arms around his neck and began to weep like a child, calling him her little this and her little that. Then she turned to me imploring ly. \"You saw how he struck me,\" she said. \"Is that the way to behave toward a woman?\" I was on the point of saying yes when Fillmore took her by the arm and started leading her off.. \"No m ore of that,\" he said. \"If y ou start again I'll crack you right here in th e street.\" I thought i t was going to start up all over again. She had fire in her e yes. But eviden tly she was a bit cowed, too, for it subsided quick ly. However , as she sat down at the café she said quietly and grimly that he needn't think it was going to be forgotten so quick ly; he'd hear m ore about i t later on... perhaps ton ight. And sure enough she kept her word. When I met him the next day his face and hands were all scratched up. Seem s she had waited until he got to bed and then, without a word, she had gone to the wardrobe and, dumping all his things out on the floor, she took them one by one and tore them to ribbons. As this had happen ed a number of times"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"before, and as she had always sewn them up afterward, he hadn't protested very much. And that made her angr ier than ever. What she wanted was to get her nails into him, and she did, to the best of her ab ility. Being pregnant she had a cert ain advan tage over hi m. Poor Fillmore! It was no laugh ing matter. She had him terrorized. If he threat ened to run away she retorted by a threat to kill him. And she said it as if she meant it. \"If you go to Amer ica,\" she said, \"I'll follow you! You won't get away from me. A French girl always knows how to get venge ance.\" And the next moment she would be coaxing him to be \"reasonab le,\" to be \" sage \", etc. Life would be so nice once they had the stationer y store. He wouldn't have to do a stroke of work. She would do everything. He could stay in back of the store and write – or whatev er he wanted to do. It went on like this, back and forth, a seesaw , for a few weeks or so. I was avoid ing them as much as possible, sick of the affair and disgusted with the both of them. Then one fine summer's day, just as I was passing the Credi t Lyonnais, who comes marching down the steps but Fillmore. I greeted him warmly, feeling rather guilty because I had dodged him for so long. I asked him, with more than ordinar y curiosit y, how things were going. He answered m e rather vaguel y and with a note of despair in his voice. \"I've just gotten permission to go to the bank,\" he said, in a peculiar, broken, abject sort of way. \"I've got about half an hour, no more. She keeps tabs on me.\" And he grasped m y arm as if to hurr y me away from the spot. We were walking down toward the Rue de Rivoli. It was a beautifu l day, warm, clear, sunny – one of those days when Paris is at its best. A mild pleasant breeze blowing, just enough to take that stagnant odor out of your nostrils. Fillmore was without a hat. Outward ly he looked the picture of health – like the average American tourist who slouches along with mo ney jingling in his pocke ts. \"I don't know what to do any more,\" he said quietly. \"You've got to do something for me. I'm helpless. I can't get a grip on myself: If I could only get away from her for a little while perhaps I'd come round all right. But she won't let me out of her sight. I just got perm ission to run to the bank – I had to draw some money. I'll walk around with you a bit then I m ust hurry back – she'll have lunch wai ting for m e.\" I listened to him quietly, thinking to myself that he certainly did need someone to pull him out of the hole he was in. He had completely caved in, there wasn't a speck of courage left in him. He was just like a child – like a child who is beaten every day and doesn 't know any more how to behave, excep t to cower and cringe. As we turned under the colonn ade of the Rue de Rivoli he burst into a long diatribe against France. He was fed up with the French. \"I used to rave about them,\" he said, \"but that was all literature. I know them now... I know what they're really like. They're cruel and mercenary. At first it seems wonderful, because you have a feeling of being free. After a while it palls on you. Underne ath it's all dead; there's no feeling, no sympathy, no friendship. They're selfish to the core. The most selfish people on earth! They think of nothing but money, money, money. And so godda mned respectab le, so bourgeois! That's what drives me nuts. When I see her mending my shirts I could club her. Alwa ys mending, mending. Saving, saving. Faut faire des économies! That's a ll I hear her say all day long. You hear it everywher e. Sois raisonnabl e, mon chéri! Sois raisonnable! I don't want to be reasonable and logical. I hate it! I want to bust loose, I want to enjoy myself. I want to do something. I don't want to sit in a café and talk all day long. Jesus, we've got our faults – but we've got enthusi asm. It's better to make mistakes than not do anything. I'd rather be a bum in Amer ica than to be sitting pretty here. Maybe it's because I'm a"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Yankee. I was born in New England and I belong there, I guess. You can't become a European overnigh t. There's something in your blood that makes you different. It's the climate – and everything. We see things with different eyes. We can't make ourselves over, however much we admire the French. Wer're Americans and we've got to remain Americans. Sure, I hate those puritani cal buggers back home – I hate 'em with all my guts. But I'm one of the m myself. I don't belong here. I'm sick of it.\" All along the arcade he went on like this. I wasn 't saying a word. I let him spill it all out – it was good for him to get it off his chest. Just the same, I was think ing how strange it was that this same guy, had it been a year ago, would have been beating his chest like a gorill a and saying: \"What a marvelous day! What a country! What a people!\" And if an Amer ican had happened along and said one word against France Fillmore would have flattened his nose. He would have died for France – a year ago. I never saw a man who was so infatua ted with a countr y, who was so happy under a foreign sky. It wasn't natura l. When he said France it meant wine, women, money in the pocket, easy come, easy go. It meant being a bad boy, being on holida y. And then, when he had had his fling, when the tent top blew off and he had a good look at the sky, he saw that it wasn't just a circus, but an arena, just like everywher e. And a damned grim one. I often used to think, when I heard him rave about glorious France, about liberty and all that crap, what it would have sounded like to a French workm an, could he have understood Fillmore's words. No wonder they think we're all crazy. We are crazy to them. We're ju st a pack of ch ildren. Senile idiots. What we call life is a five- and-ten-cen t store romance. That enthusi asm underneath – what is it? That cheap optimism which turns the stomach of any ordinar y European? It's illusion. No, illusion's too good a word for it. Illusion means something. No, it's not that – it's delusion. It's sheer delusion, that's what. We're like a herd of wild horse s with blinders over our eyes. On the rampag e. Stam pede. Over the precipice. Bango! Anything that nourishes violen ce and confusion. On! On! No matter where. And foam ing at the lips all the while. Shouting Hallelujah! Hallelu jah! Why? God knows. It's in the blood. It's the climate. It's a lot of things. It's the end, too. We're pulling the whole world down about our ears. We don't know why. It's our dest iny. The rest is plain shit... At the Palais Royal I suggested that we stop and have a drink. He hesitat ed a moment. I saw tha t he was worr ying about her, about the lunch, about th e bawling out he'd get. \"For Christ' s sake,\" I said, \"forget about her for a while. I'm going to order something to drink and I want you to drink it. Don't worry, I'm going to get you out of this fucking mess.\" I ordered two stif f whiskies. When he saw the whiskies coming he smiled at me just lik e a chi ld aga in. \"Down it!\" I said, \"and let's have anothe r. This is going to do you good. I don't care what the doctor sa ys – this ti me it'll be all right. Co me on, do wn with it!\" He put it down all right and while the garçon disappeared to fetch another round he looked at me with brimming eyes, as though I were the last friend in the world. His lips were twitching a bit, too. There was something he wanted to say to me and he didn't quite know how to begin. I looked at him easily, as though ignoring the appeal and, shoving the saucers aside, I leaned over on my elbow and I said to him earnestl y: \"Look here, Fil lmore, what is it you'd really like to do? Tell me!\" With that the tears gushed up and he blurted out: \"I'd like to be home with my peopl e. I'd like to hear English spoken.\" The tears were streaming down his face. He made no effort to brush them away. He just let everything gush forth. Jesus, I thought to myself,"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"that's fine to have a release like that. Fine to be a complete coward at least once in your life. To let go that way. Great! Great! It did me so much good to see him break down that way that I felt as though I could solve any proble m. I felt courageous and resolut e. I had a thousand ideas in m y head at once. \"Listen,\" I said, bending still closer to him, \"if you mean what you said why don't you do it... why don't you go? Do y ou know what I would do, if I were in your shoes? I'd go today. Yes, by Jesus, I mean it... I'd go right away, without even saying good - bye to her. As a matter of fact that's the only way you can go – she'd never let you say good - bye. You know tha t.\" The garçon came with the whiskies. I saw him reach forward with a desperat e eagerness and raise the glass to his lips. I saw a glint of hope in his eyes – far - off, wild, desperate. He probabl y saw himself swim ming across the Atlan tic. To me it looked easy, simple as rolling off a log. The whole thing was working itself out rapid ly in my mind. I knew j ust what ea ch step would be. Clear as a bell, I was. \"Whose mo ney is that in the bank?\" I asked. \"Is it her fa ther's or is it y ours?\" \"It's mine!\" he exclaimed. \"My mother sent it to me. I don't want any of her goddam ned mon ey.\" \"That's swell!\" I said. \"Listen, suppose we hop a cab and go back there. Draw out every cent. Then we'll go to the British Consulat e and get a visa. You're going to hop the train this afternoon for London. From London you'll take the first boat to Americ a. I'm saying that because then you won't be worried about her trailing you. She'll never suspect that you went via London. If she goes searching for you she'll natura lly go to Le Havre first, or Cherbour g... And here's anoth er thing – you're not going back to get your things. You're going to leave everything here. Let her keep them. With that French mind of hers she'll never dream that you scooted off without bag or baggag e. It's incred ible. A Frenchm an would never dream of doing a thing like that... unless he was as cracked as you are.\" \"You're right!\" he exclaimed. \"I never thought of that. Besides, you might send them to me later on – if she'll surrender them! But that doesn 't matter now. Jesus, though, I haven't even got a hat!\" \"What do you need a hat for? When you get to London you can buy everything you need. All y ou need now is to hurry. We've got to find out when the tra in leav es.\" \"Listen,\" he said, reach ing for his wallet, \"I'm going to leave everything to you. Here, take this and do whatever's nec essary. I'm too weak... I'm dizzy.\" I took the wallet and emptied it of the bills he had just drawn from the bank. A cab was standing at the curb. We hopped in. There was a train leaving the Gare du Nord at four o'clock, or thereabouts. I was figuring it our the bank, the Consulate, the Amer ican Express, the stat ion. Fine! Just about make it. \"Now buck up!\" I said, \"and keep y our shirt on! S hit! in a few hour s you'll be cros sing the Channel. Tonight you'll be walking around in London and you'll get a good bellyful of English. Tomorrow you'll be on the open sea – and then, by Jesus, you're a free man and you needn't give a fuck what happens. By the time you get to New York this'll be nothing m ore than a bad drea m.\" This got him so excited that his feet were moving convulsivel y, as if he were trying to run inside the cab. At the bank his hand was trembling so that he could hardl y sign his name. That was one thing I couldn't do for him – sign his name. But I think, had it been"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"necessar y, I could have sat him on the toilet and wiped his ass. I was determined to ship him off, even if I had to fold hi m up and put hi m in a valise. It was lunch hour when we got to the British Consulate, and the place was closed. That meant waiting until two o 'clock. I couldn't think of an ything bet ter to do, b y way of killing time, than to eat. Fillmore, of course, wasn't hungr y. He was for eating a sandwich. \"Fuck that!\" I said. \"You're going to blow me to a good lunch. It's the last square meal you're going to have over here – maybe for a long while.\" I steer ed him to a cosy little restaurant and ordered a good spread. I ordered the best wine on the menu, regardless of price or taste. I had all his money in my pocke t – oodles of it, it seem ed to me. Certa inly never before had I had so much in my fist at one time. It was a treat to break a thousand franc note. I held it up to the light first to look at the beautifu l water mark. Beaut iful money! One of the few things the French make on a grand scale. Artistica lly done, too, as if th ey cherished a deep affection even for the symbol. The meal over, we went to a café. I ordered Chartreuse with the coffee. Why not? And I broke another bill – a five-hundred franc note this time. It was a clean, new, crisp bill. A pleasure to handle such money. The waiter handed me back a lot of dirty old bills that had been patched up with strips of gummed paper; I had a stack of five and ten franc notes and a bagful of chicken feed. Chinese money, with holes in it. I didn't know in which pocket to stuff the money any more. My trousers were bursting with coins and bills. It made me slight ly uncom fortab le also, hauling all that dough out in publi c. I was afraid we mi ght be taken for a couple of crooks. When we got to the American Express there wasn't a devil of a lot of time left. The British, in their usual fumbling farting way, had kept us on pins and needles. Here everybody was sliding around on castors. They were so speedy that everything had to be done twice. After all the checks were signed and clipped in a neat little holder , it was discovered that he had signed in the wrong place. Nothing to do but start all over again. I stood over him, with one eye on the clock, and watch ed every stroke of the pen. It hurt to hand over the dough. Not all of it, thank God – but a good part of it. I had roughl y about 2,500 francs in my pocke t. Roughl y, I say. I wasn't count ing by francs any more. A hundred, or two hundred, more or less – it didn't mean a godda mned thing to me. As for him, he was going through the whole transact ion in a daze. He didn't know how much money he had. All he knew was that he had to keep something aside for Ginette. He wasn't certain yet how much – we were going to figure that out on the way to the station. In the excitement we had forgotten to chang e all the money. We were already in the cab, however , and there wasn't any time to be lost. The thing was to find out how we stood. We emptied our pockets quickly and began to whack it up. Some of it was lying on the floor , some of it was on the seat. It was bewild ering. There was F rench, American and English money. And all that chicken feed besides. I felt like picking up the coins and chucking them out of the windo w – just to simplify matters. Final ly we sifted it all out; he held on to the Engl ish and Amer ican mon ey, and I held on to the French m oney. We had to decide quick ly now what to do abou t Ginett e – how much to give her, what to tell her, etc. He was trying to fix up a yarn for me to hand her – didn't want her to break her heart and so forth. I had to cut him short. \"Never mind what to tell her,\" I said. \"Leav e that to me. How much are you going to give her, that's the thing? Why give her anything?\" That was like setting a bomb under his ass. He burst into tears. Such tears! It was"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"worse than before. I though t he was going to collapse on my hands. Withou t stopping to think, I said: \"All right, let's give her all this French money. That ought to last her for a while.\" \"How m uch is it?\" he asked feebl y. \"I don 't know – abou t 2,000 francs or so. More than she deserves an yway.\" \"Christ! Don't say that!\" he begged. \"After all, it's a rotten break I'm giving her. Her folks'll never take her back now. No, give it to her. Give her the whole damned business... I don't car e what i t is.\" He pulled a handker chief out to wipe the tears away. \"I can't help it,\" he said. \"It's too much for me.\" I said nothing. Suddenl y he sprawled himself out full length – I though t he was taking a fit or so mething – and he said: \"Jesus, I think I ought to go back. I ought to go back and face the music. If anything should happen to her I'd never forgive myself.\" That was a rude jolt for me. \"Christ!\" I shouted, \"you can't do that! Not now. It's too late. You're going to take the train and I' m going to tend to her myself. I'll go see her just as soon as I leave you. Why, you poor boob, if she ever thought you had tried to run away from her she'd murder you, don't you realize that? You can't go back any more. It's settled.\" Anyway, what could go wrong ? I asked m yself. Kill herself? Tant mieux. When we rolled up to the station we had still about twelve minutes to kill. I didn't dare to say good - bye to him yet. At the last minute, rattled as he was, I could see him jumping off the train and scooting back to her. Anything might swerve him. A straw . So I dragged hi m across the stree t to a bar and I said: \"Now you're going to have a Pernod – your last Pernod and I'm going to pa y for it... with your dough.\" Something about this remark made him look at me uneasil y. He took a big gulp of the Pernod and then, turning to me like an injured dog, he said: \"I know I oughtn't to trust you with all that money, but... but... Oh, well, do what you think best. I don't want her to kil l herself, that's all.\" \" Kill her sel f? \" I said. \"Not her! You must think a hell of a lot of yourself if you can believ e a thing like that. As for the money, though I hate to give it to her, I prom ise you I'll go straigh t to the post office and telegraph it to her. I wouldn't trust myself with it a minute longer than is necessar y.\" As I said this I spied a bunch of post cards in a revolving rack. I grabbed one off – a pictur e of the Eiffel Tower it was – and made him write a few words. \"Tell her you're sailing now. Tell her you love her and that you'll send for her as soon as you arrive... I'll send it by pneumatique when I go to the post office. And tonight I'll see her . Ever ything'l l be Jake, you'll see.\" With that we walked across the street to the station. Only two minutes to go. I felt it was safe now. At the gate I gave him a slap on the back and point ed to the train. I didn't shake hands with him – he would have slobbered all over me. I just said: \"Hurr y! She's going in a minute.\" And with that I turned on my heel and marched off. I didn't even look round to see if he was boarding the train. I was afra id to. I hadn't thought, all the while I was bundl ing him off, what I'd do once I was free of him. I had prom ised a lot of things – but that was only to keep him quiet. As for facing"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Ginette, I had about as little courage for it as he had. I was getting panicky myself: Everything had happen ed so quickl y that it was impossible to grasp the nature of the situat ion in full. I walked away from the station in a kind of delicious stupor – with the post card in my hand. I stood against a lamppost and read it over. It sounded preposterous. I read it again, to make sure that I wasn 't dreaming, and then I tore it up and threw it in the gutte r. I looked around uneasil y, half expec ting to see Ginet te coming after me with a tomahawk. Nobod y was following me. I started walking leisurel y toward the Place Lafayette. It was a beaut iful day, as I had observed earlier. Light, puffy clouds above, sailing with the wind. The awnings flapping. Paris had never looked so good to me; I almost felt sorry that I had shipped the poor bugger off. At the Place Lafayette I sat down facing the church and stared at the clock tower; it's not such a wonderful piece of archit ecture, but that blue in the dial face always fascina ted me. It was bluer than ever today. I couldn't take my eyes off it. Unless he were crazy enough to write her a letter, expla ining everything, Ginette need never know what had happen ed. And even if she did learn that he had left her 2,500 francs or so she couldn't prove it. I could always say that he imagined it. A guy who was crazy enough to walk off without even a hat was crazy enough to invent the 2,500 francs, or whatever it was. How much was it, anyhow?, I wondered. My pockets were sagging with the weigh t of it. I hauled it all out and count ed it careful ly. There was exact ly 2,875 francs and 35 centimes. More than I had thought. The 75 francs and 35 centimes had to be gotten rid of. I wanted an even sum – a clean 2,800 francs. Just then I saw a cab pulling up to the curb. A woman stepped out with a white poodle dog in her hands; the dog was peeing over her silk dress. The idea of taking a dog for a ride got me sore. I'm as good as her dog, I said to myself, and with that I gave the driver a sign and told him to drive me through the Bois. He wanted to know where exact ly. \"Anywhere,\" I said. \"Go through the Bois, go all around it – and take your time, I'm in no hurry.\" I sank back and let the houses whizz by, the jagged roofs, the chimney pots, the colored walls, the urinals, the dizzy carrefours. Passing the Rond - Point I thought I'd go downsta irs and take a leak. No telling what might happen down there. I told the driver to wait. It was the first time in my life I had let a cab wait while I took a leak. How much ran you wast a that way? Not very much. With what I had in my pocket I could afford to have two taxis waiting for me. I took a good look around but I didn't see anything worth while. What I wanted was something fresh and unused – something from Alaska or the Virgin Islands. A clean fresh pelt with a natura l fragranc e to it. Needless to say, there wasn 't anything like that walking about. I wasn 't terribly disappointed. I didn't give a fuck whether I found anything or not. The thing is, never to be too anxious. Ever ything comes in due ti me. We drove on past the Arc de Triomphe. A few sightseers were loitering around the remains of the Unknown Soldier. Going through the Bois I looked at all the rich cunts prom enading in their limousines. They were whizzing by as if they had some destinat ion. Do that, no doubt, to look import ant – to show the world how smooth run their Rolls - Royces and their Hispano Suizas. Inside me things were running smooth er than any Rolls - Royce ever ran. It was just like velvet inside. Velvet cortex and velvet vertebra e. And velvet axle grease, what! It's a wonderfu l thing, for half an hour, to have money in your pocke t and piss it away like a drunken sailor. You feel as though the world is yours. And the best part of it is, you don't know what to do with it. You can sit back and let the meter run wild, you can let the wind blow through your hair, you can"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"stop and have a drink, you can give a big tip, and you can swagger off as though it were an ever yday occurrenc e. But y ou can't creat e a revo lution. You can't wash all the dir t out of your belly. When we got to the Porte d'Auteui l I made him head for the Seine. At the Pont de Sèvres I got out and started walking along the river, toward the Auteui l Viaduc t. It's about the size of a creek along here and the trees come right down to the river's bank. The water was green and glass y, especi ally near the other side. Now and then a scow chugged by. Bathers in tights were standing in the grass sunning themselves. Ever ything was close and palp itant, and vibran t with th e strong ligh t. Passing a beer garden I saw a group of cyclists sitting at a table. I took a seat nearb y and ordered a demi . Hearing them jabber away I thought for a moment of Ginette. I saw her stamping up and down the room, tearing her hair, and sobbing and bleating, in that beastlik e way of hers. I saw his hat on the rack. I wondered if his clothes would fit me. He had a raglan that I particularly liked. Well, by now he was on his way. In a little while the boat would be rocking under him. Engl ish! He wanted to hear Engl ish spoken. What an idea! Suddenl y it occurred to me that if I wanted I could go to Americ a myself. It was the first time the opportun ity had ever presented itself. I asked myself – \"do you want to go?\" There was no answer . My thoughts drifted out, toward the sea, toward the other side where, taking a last look back, I had seen the skyscrapers fading out in a flurry of snowflakes. I saw them looming up again, in that same ghostly way as when I left. Saw the lights creep ing through their ribs. I saw the whole city spread out, from Harlem to the Battery, the streets choked with ants, the elevated rushing by, the theaters emptying. I wondered in a vague wa y what had ever happened to m y wife. After everything had quietly sifted through my head a great peace came over me. Here, where the river gently winds through the girdle of hills, lies a soil so saturated with the past that however far back the mind roams one can never detach it from its human background. Christ, before my eyes there shimmered such a golden peace that only a neurot ic could dream of turning his head away. So quietly flows the Seine that one hardl y notices its presence. It is always there, quiet and unobtrusive, like a great artery running through the human body. In the wonderful peace that fell over me itseemed as if I had climbed to the top of a high mounta in; for a little while I would be able to look around me, to take in the m eaning of the landscape. Human beings make a strange fauna and flora. From a distance they appear neglig ible; close up they are apt to appear ugly and malicious. More than anything they need to be surrounded with suf ficien t space – space even m ore than time. The sun is setting. I feel this river flowing through meits past, its ancien t soil, the changing climate. The hil ls gentl y girdle it about : its course is fixed."}]
