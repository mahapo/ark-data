Thus, they were Torchbearers of the Great Light which lit the world through history’s darkest periods. Without their help it is likely that the human race would not have advanced to its present level of understanding and tolerance, even though we must recognize that humanity still has far to go to be a model of Divine Perfection on Earth. In concurrence with this initiation, whose purpose is to awaken your spiritual being, we offer this short biography of one of those greater avatars who, through time and space, transmitted Light to humanity. AKHNATON (Amenhotep IV) According to the archives of our Order, Amenhotep I V was born in the royal palace of Thebes on November 24, 1378 BCE. He was the son of Amenhotep III and Queen Tiy. In 1367, when he was o nly eleven years old, he was crowned and thus became the pharaoh of Egypt. A t a very young age he married Nefertiti (whose name means “The Coming of Beauty”) with whom he had seven daughters. From an early age, Amenhotep IV rejected the supers titious practices of the priests of Amon. He considered the priests to b e only impostors who took advantage of the credulity of the people so as to e xert absolute power over them. From the time he was vested with the required autho rity, Amenhotep opposed the priesthood with unprecedented determination, fo r he was convinced that the entire universe was the work of One God, rather than a multitude of gods and goddesses that must be adored by means of many sacrifices. Thus, for the first time in recorded history, monotheism supplant ed a polytheism which, by this time, had spread over the entire surface of th e Earth. For centuries after his reign, Amenhotep IV was represented as an individua l afflicted by madness; however, historians now agree that this pharaoh ins pired an unprecedented cultural and spiritual revolution. The priests of Heliopolis, as was generally true of priests throughout Egypt, thought that the Sun, which they called Ra, was the God of all the gods and goddesses. They worshiped Ra most often under t he name of Amon-Ra. For Amenhotep IV the Sun was merely the visible sym bol of the invisible God in which he believed and whom he called Aton.

This should not be seen as an obligation, because, according to the traditional rules of our Order, you remain free to live Rosicrucianism as you understand it and, perhaps, most of all, as you exp erience it. However, the idea of the sanctum is rooted in the history of our myst ical organization and, for centuries, Rosicrucians have given it great importa nce. For many of them the sanctum is a place they revere because of the symbo lism they have attributed to it, and it is in this place that they take pleas ure in studying their monographs and in meditating on the spiritual values of existe nce. When the proper time comes, we will give you further explanations concer ning the Rosicrucian sanctum and we will ask you to consecrate it with a special ritual that will make it a place whose vibratory nature gives it a m ystical dimension benefiting you on all levels. Due to the importance attributed to the Rosicrucian sanctum by our Tradition, we will presume that you now have a perm anent one or, at the very least, that you will obtain everything necessary—na mely, a table or a shelf, a mirror, and two candles—for when you conduct your s tudy period. However, if it is absolutely impossible for you to arrange a sa nctum for your weekly work, you must of course continue your studies, as you ha ve until the present. What matters most of all is working on a regular basis a nd putting your whole heart into the study and practice of our teachings. On th e other hand, when carrying out Rosicrucian initiations, it is essential that y ou have the benefit of some sort of sanctum, whether permanent or temporary. If, for whatever reason, this is not possible, we advise you nevertheless to read th e following ritual, as though it were a monograph. In this way you can absorb its contents and continue your normal Rosicrucian studies without feeling tha t you are getting behind. However, once you are able to set up a sanctum, you must carry out this initiation, so that your Rosicrucian progression wi ll be in complete conformity with our Tradition. You may have noted that an oath is included with th is special monograph. Ideally, it must be read and signed at a given moment in the following initiation. If you cannot conduct the initiation right away for the reasons we have just explained, read it just the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Neophyte Section Atrium 1 Initiation same, sign it, and store it in your records, prefer ably in your study notebook. If you are a companion member, please photocopy the oa th before it is filled out or signed. This Neophyte’s Oath is very important o n the mystical level. Before allowing you to proceed with the following r itual, we must once again emphasize the fact that Rosicrucian initiatio ns have no connection whatsoever with magical practices, for AMORC has ne ver taught or approved of such methods. Moreover, it has always opposed su ch practices firmly, because black magic is founded on principles that r esort to strange and unusual manifestations bordering upon the “supernatural.” R osicrucianism is instead a mystical way that exalts the study of cosmic laws, such as those manifested in the universe, in nature, and in human beings. It is also a philosophy based on the desire to perfect oneself and to express in one ’s behavior the noblest virtues of the human soul. Rosicrucian initiations are not religious in charac ter. Their goal is to enable each member to gain greater awareness of his or her spiritual nature and to establish a more intimate dialogue between the obje ctive self and the inner self. The key to the mastery of life lies in the ability to create this dialogue, because it is what gives the individual that inspiration, w ill, and power to manifest on Earth the grandeur and glory of Divine Intellige nce which vibrates in the individual’s innermost self and in the heart of the most distant galaxies. In this regard, Rosicrucian initiation constitutes an ideal path to “know oneself and thus to know the universe and the gods.” * * *"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Neophyte Section Atrium 1 Initiation PRELIMINARY INSTRUCTIONS Sanctum Preparation: To complete the following initiation ritual it is i mperative that your sanctum be properly equipped as we have said and that you a re in a state of perfect tranquility, without risk of being disturbed. The lighting of the room in which you have set up y our sanctum must be as subdued as possible. However, the light must be sufficient so you can read the instructions without difficulty. The candles of your sanctum must not be lit prior t o the ritual. You may burn a little incense. Have a box of matches within reach, as they will be needed during your initiation. Likewise, have a candle snuffer nearby. Place a pen and a bowl holding a small amount of wa ter on your sanctum altar. Special Instructions: Before beginning the following ritual, wash your ha nds as a sign of physical purification and drink a glass of water as a sign o f mental purification. If you own a Rosicrucian apron, put it on. As was e xplained to you in the booklet entitled Neophyte Guide — Rosicrucian Initiation , this apron is a symbol of mystical work and veneration. In the ritual you are about to carry out, you must always imagine that you are being directed by your Class Master and that he or she is present on the invisible plane. As soon as you feel ready to carry out this initiat ion, sit facing your sanctum mirror and, after a few minutes of meditation, begi n to read the following:"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Neophyte Section Atrium 1 Initiation RITUAL Class Master: (Read the following in a low voice an d imagine that your Class Master is present and speaking to you on the invisi ble plane.) Beloved Postulant, I greet you before the Rosicruci an Sign! It is with joy that I will now guide you in this in itiation which will make you a Neophyte of our Order and, in that capacity, a full member of our organization. I ask you to giv e all your attention, all your trust, and all your sincerity t o this symbolic ceremony, so that you may pass through this first P ortal in all purity and in perfect dignity. Now arise and light the candle on your left and, im mediately after doing so, say the following: “May this light, symbol of the Great Light of Cosmic Wisdom, spread its radian ce in the midst of darkness and illuminate my path.” Postulant: (Follow these instructions with sincerit y and by being as receptive as possible on the inner level.) Class Master: (Read the following while still imagi ning that your Class Master is guiding you in this ritual.) Postulant, now light the other candle and, immediat ely after doing so, say the following: “Unto Light is added l ight, so that my inner Light, united with the Great Light of Cosmic Wisdom, may guide my steps out of the forest of err ors where ignorance, superstition, and suffering reign.” Postulant: (Do what your Class Master has asked of you, and then be seated. Meditate a few moments on what you have jus t said and done, and then continue.) Class Master: Know, O Postulant, that fire, from t he most remote antiquity, has symbolized the purification, regeneration, and illumination which human consciousness may receive when harmoniz ing itself with Cosmic Consciousness. Many centuries be fore the Christian era, in some form or other, a sacred flame burned on the altar of many temples. It symbolized the Omnipresence, Omnipotence, and Omniscience of the D ivine Fire. And humans, because we possess that Divine Fi re in"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Neophyte Section Atrium 1 Initiation our innermost beings, are fascinated by the power w hich the flame exerts over us. Have you not noticed how human beings experience pe ace and harmony of thought when we meditate together around the same hearth? This is so because the sight of fire s heds light on our souls, warms our hearts, and awakens within us the noblest sentiments. Of that you must always be conscious, b ecause as long as you seek the Greater Light, your own inner Light will guide your steps. Now, Postulant, arise, lightly dip the tip of your right index finger in the water. Now trace a cross in the cente r of your sanctum mirror, and say the following words: “Rosic rucian Tradition states that when human beings saluted the sunrise for the first time, we did so with arms outstretched to the sides, and as we were thus venerating the coming of the light of dawn, the shadow formed by our body on the ground had the app earance of a cross. This allegory has traversed centuries a nd the cross has thus become for mystics the symbol of the physi cal body and of the trials of earthly life, which, symbolica lly, is only the shadow of Cosmic Life.” Postulant: (Do and say what was asked of you.) Class Master: (Continue reading while paying attent ion to what is said.) Now dip the tip of your right index finger in the water again and lightly trace a circle in the center of the cro ss. Then read the following words: “By this circle is symbolized the rose, which repr esents the human soul in its gradual blossoming in contact wit h the mundane world. When the rose is joined with the cro ss, we become a vehicle of Cosmic Consciousness on Earth a nd participate in the Great Work. May the Rosy Cross t hus be for me the symbol of my own evolution and of my sin cere desire to reflect the Greater Light in each of my thoughts, words, and actions.” Class Master:"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Neophyte Section Atrium 1 Initiation Postulant: (After following the preceding instructi ons, be seated and, after pausing about one minute, continue this ritua l.) Class Master: (Read the following in a low voice.)

The time has come for you to fill this abyss, for such is the condition you must atta in if you want to make yourself the master of your life. To help y ou, I will now leave you alone with yourself and I will ask you so me questions which you must answer by facing your conscience.

Class Master: (Read the following sentences with so lemnity.)

What cannot be doubted about them is the legacy of words of wisdom which reflect the Illumination that raised them above oth er people.

When you have dawned in eastern lightland, You fill every land with your beauty. You are beauteous, great, radiant, High over every land; Your rays embrace the lands, To the limit of all that you made. Being Re, you reach their limits, You bend them for the son whom you love; Though you are far, your rays are on earth, Though one sees you, your strides are unseen. When you set in western lightland, Earth is in darkness as if in death; One sleeps in chambers, heads covered, One eye does not see another. Were they robbed of their goods, That are under their heads, People would not remark it. Every lion comes from its den, All the serpents bite; Darkness hovers, earth is silent, As their maker rests in lightland. Earth brightens when you dawn in lightland, When you shine as Aten of daytime; As you dispel the dark, As you cast your rays, The Two Lands are in festivity. Awake they stand on their feet, You have roused them; Bodies cleansed, clothed, Their arms adore your appearance."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The entire land sets out to work, All beasts browse on their herbs; Trees, herbs are sprouting, Birds fly from their nests, Their wings greeting your ka.

How many are your deeds, Though hidden from sight, O Sole God beside whom there is none! You made the earth as you wished, you alone, All peoples, herds, and flocks; All upon earth that walk on legs, All on high that fly on wings, The lands of Khor and Kush, The land of Egypt.

H e thought the Sun to be an appropriate symbol because this Intelligence bri ngs vitality to all earthly creatures through solar rays. He also meant to show that the One God was present in the heart of everyone, much as the Sun s preads its light and warmth upon every being. Aton was therefore often represen ted by a solar disk whose rays ended in hands, thus symbolizing Aton’s desire to spread blessings on all humanity, without distinction as to gender or race. These were convictions that were very advanced on a philosophical level. Very soon, Akhnaton left Thebes, Egypt’s traditiona l capital. He constructed a splendid new capital named Akhetaton (near modern-day Tell el- Amarna in central Egypt) which, naturally, was dedi cated to his new religion. He summoned to Akhetaton the most learned men and w omen of his time and, with their assistance, laid the foundations of a my stical organization whose ideals and teachings were to spread all over the fa ce of the Earth. In the heart of Akhetaton he built a temple in which this group met regularly to study the arts, sciences, and Mysteries. Our Order is presently a t rustee of all the knowledge that was accumulated in this place of which only a few ruins remain today. Throughout his life, the greatest desire of Akhnato n was to behold the face of the living and unique God he had strived to serv e.
