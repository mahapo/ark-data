The l ove with which Paul Sédir researched and assem bled the materials and quotations is clear on every page. However, th e read er sho uld be a lerted to th e f act th at this brings p roblem s of its o wn! While Sédir’s French is clear enough to follow, the quotations he cites com e from writers of many differ ent centuries, of m any different languages translated with varying degrees of success into French. I have tried m y best with these, but the reader should be alerted to the f act that my lim itations regarding the transla tion of early m etaphysical concep ts, sym bolically portrayed, certainly m ean that som e of the passa ges could have been better translated. As usual I have tried to let the words flow rather than allow m yself t o be strangled by perfect grammatical transliteratio n. Som e m ay disagree with this method, but I feel it is m ore im portant to go with the fluidity of the work th an tie the rea der down with obs cure tenses an d tortuous form s (thought these still abound, despite m y best efforts). Again, forgive any spelling mistakes and typos. They are all m ine! The book itself wanders delightfully from history to sym bolism to constitutions to history as can be seen in the Index, reflecting an elegant lightness of style, as though we were floating on the surface o f a stream , and gazing th rough the sh ifting waters at the p rofound depths b elow. The books can be read at several levels: as a history book, as a book of interesting quotations concerning a mystical Order, and as a m anual for the aspiring Rosicrucian. I have kept my footnotes to a mi nimu m. S ome words are in red. These are either words I couldn’ t find a trans lation to in sev eral dic tiona ries ; or wor ds which we re s imply illegible in the poor copy from which I was working. Finally I would once again lke to thank the support and especially the patience of those awaiting this trans lation , partic ularly Brother Réauxcroix, and to the m emory of his friend, Madam e Za dah Guerin-McCaffery, whose devotion to the translation of Paul Sédir’s Christian works into E nglish is an inspira tion to us all.

A single principle rules the co sm os, individuals and groups. G od has given rules and laws to the great All and, to the beings w hich populate the universe, He has given free will. W hen one of these law s is infringed, a regulator com es to bring not judgm ent but hope; his function is to reestablish e quilib rium . This is th e r ole of the co mets. These follo w a determ ined circuit in space. Th ey never return by the s ame path. When one has accomplished its m ission, it disappears, and another com es to take up the path the form er one has left. Here, now, is the origin of the hum an races. At a given mom ent God sent a party of angels into Creation to obtain knowledge of it. This descen t into the re lative has b een called ‘the fall’ by som e theol ogies. But there was no ‘fall’ in the ethic al sen se of the word. Th e only ‘fall’ is when we comm it a fault. However, we can be sur e that th ese crea tures w ho were thr own into the rela tive w ould find it im possible to rise back up towards the A bsolute – w hich is the r eas on and purpose of their existence – if the Father did not give them ev eryth ing they needed to ascend these “paths of return ”. The paths are those which are fixed here belo w, and which exist in every world. E ach family of be ings has their own path and all the mem bers of a f amily f ollow the sam e path. Every creature has his own path to travel, an d it is d ifferent for each person. The Belgian astronom er Charles Lagrange (1), continuing the work undertaken in the first part of the 19th Century by Major Brück, studied, using scie ntif ic m eans, the “law s constituting a definite link between the life of h umanity and the physical organism of the globe” (2). He established “that historical movem ent is regulated on a m athem atical canvas, defined and determ ined in the m inutest de tail” (2) and he d eclared th at “the loca tio ns of cente rs of activ ity , such as London, Jerusalem , Rom e, birthplaces and the activities of fa mous m en, m issionnaries of hum anity – none of this is arbitrary; all is c hosen and determ ined in a m athe matical m anner . There is a historical geom etry and cinem atogr aphy” (2). “This whole layout is written in a geom etric fashion on the surface of the earth arranged as his torical places ” (3). But this is b ut an inf initessim al part of the reality; and it is almost im possible to explain the com plete pictu re. In fact, following the lin es or ien ted f rom the East to the W est, to the points determ ined f rom the orig in of the f ormation of th e earth and of m an, all m anifestation of the life of beings in their individual evolution and in their spatial developm ent: religions, philosophies, sciences, aesthetics, the art of war, therapy, legislation, so ciology, events, etc. are m apped out. 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" A sim ilar pr ovidence rules th e lif e of all the worlds, such that, as Lagrange said, “the entire universe it itself only a sign , a writing of the truths of the spiritual order” (4). But the Father not only organized in advance the f ram ework in which the life of creatures would unfold; He also wished th e word of God to be anno unced to ev ery race which cam e into the world by m eans of a special envo y, in a way wh ich would best suit its mental attitude and its modes of existence. From the creation of the wo rld, then, these envoys have been a center fomr which the true Light has shone forth in all its prim itive pu rity. And th is is how th e unwritten Word has been transm itted by the m essengers of God to these creatures through th e ages, until they m ight return to the ir orig inal estate. *** What kind of Tradition is this? Modern theoreticians give two contrasting re plies to this question. For som e, this trad ition is purely m etaphysical; for others – in which group we include ours elves – th is trad ition is mystical. Am ong the adherents of the m etaphysical thes is, in our W estern world, René Guénon occupies a a m ost exalted place. The num erous wo rks which he has pub lished on th is subject are most wise, having a praiseworthy clarity, precision and objectiv ity. T hey are of fundam ental value to contem porary thinkers, whose intellectual subtlety of ten risk th em being led astray on the subject by m eans of the current vulgarizations on m etaphysics which are often overly superficial and not at all objectiv e; w hich, conversely to what happe ns in the W est, is always the object of effective know ledge in the East. R. Guénon summarized the principle id eas of his works in a conference on Oriental Metaphysics , rem arkably pertinent and cl ear at the sam e tim e, which he gave at the Sorbonne in 1925, and whose thesis follows: Metaphysics is knowledge par excellence . It is not natural know ledge, neither regarding its object nor regarding the facili ties by which it is obtained. Indee d, it has nothing to do with the scientific and rational re alm s. It is not about setting up abstr actions, but about obtaining a direct understanding of eternal and imm utable principles. Metaphysics is not hum an knowledge. It is thus not as a m an that m an c an obtain it; it is through effectively becom ing aware of supra-in dividual states. Identification through knowledge – according to the ax iome of Aristotle: ‘a being is the sum of all he knows’ – is the v ery princip le of m etaphysical realization. The m ost important means is c oncentration. Realizati on consists firstly in the indefinite developm ent of all possibilitie s virtu ally contain ed in the individua l; then in def initiv ely passin g through the world of form s, up to the degree of universality which is that of pure being. 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The ultim ate goal of m etaphysical realization is a totally unco ndition al state, free from all lim itation. T he being thus freed is then truly in possession of the plenit ude of his potentials. This is un ion with the s uprem e Principle. True m etaphysics cannot be determ ined in tim e: it is eternal. It is an order of knowledge reserv ed to an elite. *** We can see, from this far too short summa ry, the ease with which R. Guénon guides us on the path of Far Eastern m editation, which can be dinconcerting to us W esterners, of Far Eastern m editation. The student can also read with inte rest the m any passages where, in his other writings, th e author id entif ies th e m ost suggestiv e ana logies be tween the doctr ine of a Sankaratcharya for example, and other esoteric tradition s: Taoism , Suf ism , Herm eticism , Kabbala, Catholic theology, and the Gospel. However, I will add a f ew ref lection s. In one of his best known works, 1 R. Guénon warns us – w ith good reason – against obsession w ith the system. In effect , every system is a particularizat ion, and thus a cause of error. In knowledge, in “gnosis”, all is possible, and all contains a cert ain portion of truth: but nothing contain s th e sum of all truths. Let u s add that this abs tract sum does not itse lf con stitu te total Truth, which will always exceed it. For R. Guénon, this absence of system atization is the very character of m etaphysics, above all of Hindu m etaphysics. I will add that it is also m ore profoundly the sam e character of in tuitiv e and d irect Knowledge that th e Holy Spirit accords the perfect disciple of Christ. Moreover, it is understood that intuitiv e Knowledge, the only universal, surpasses discurs ive, r ationa l and m ental knowledge; the latte r bein g constitu ted by the totality of the greatest possible num ber of specific articles of knowledge, and by their synthesis. On the other hand, it is understood th at language – whatever the richness a nd precision of its idiom s, such as Sanscrit and other sim ilar East ern tongues – describes above all the experiences of ordinary consciousness; and that, when one passes into th e supram ental regions w hich Europeans call the unconscious, but which, in realit y, are m ore subtle levels of consciousness, hum an languages lose their precision, above all when they are e xpected to express stat es of consciousness unknown to the reader. How then, for exam ple, can som eone affirm that the T aoist Wang is th e Hebrew Adam Kadmon ; tha t the Ruach Elohim is com parable to Hamsa – ther e is no n eed to adding m ore analogies. How then, I ask, m ay one propose such equalities if one has not personally experien ced that state of life called Wang, Adam Kadmon, Hamsa or Ruach ? T he theoretical idea one m akes about a thing is not always precise: dail y experience teaches us that. Such self-confidence, however sincere and c onscientious it m ay be, is, in m y opinion, born of a preconceived faith in the superiorit y of intellectual specul ation. Certainly, true   1 L'Homme et son Devenir, selon le Védânta , Paris (Bossard), 1925. 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"metaphysics, to which R. Guénon dedicated his labo rs, is most beautiful, the purest of regards that thought can give towards the abstract univers e. But its exclusive cult necessarily leads to a disgust towards life and activity. This is exac tly why, cries M. Guénon, Europeans show that they are but turbulent children, and he sm iles at us with the sa me sm ile th at the sage L ao Tsu, the venerable Rishis, and all the Muni s, a d all the J ivanm uktis ind ulgently giv es towards the barba ric noisiness of the W est. If the goal o f life is but knowle dge, if it is enou gh to think to fulfill our hum an labor; if nothing exists except states of consciousness, then nothing is more im portant. The only task worthy of us is to set aside all cr eatures, all desire and all work, so that w e m ay take refuge in an incre asing ly abstr act, incre asing ly genera l, increasingly imm obile consciousness within ourselves. No doubt this is a be autiful and austere program ; but it is unrealizable except by beings who are pure intelligence. And then, all the exis ting m anif estations of th e Absolute becom e trifles from whi ch we should turn asid e. Yet to abandon them because they em barrass us, as the yogi or arhat do, is neither generous nor Christian. In truth, the s entim ental c harac ter of Christianity brings a sm ile to the disillusioned lips of these sages. In m y opinion, the progressive realization of the Gospel commandm ents operate in our being a slow spiritualization, dur ing the course of which uncons cious perceives the Light m ore clearly, and our intellect, our br ain, our very body becom es m ore and more perm eable to this Light, understanding thus grows spontaneously in us, in proportion with our im proving in action, through renewed victories over egotism. Orientals seek release; Christians seek salvation. Release is the conquest of the independence of laws, form s and appetites. Sa lvation is, for the crowd, a prolongation of the happiness of terrestrial individuality. This should be – if all Christians really understood their Maste r – th e transm igration of the total indiv idual into the etern al King dom . Orientals wan t to conquer their confinem ent by taking ref uge in the abstract point, whic h is the origin of all spatial for ms. Christians striv e to m ake them selves able to receiv e Liberty through the baptism of the Spirit. The two independent paths ar e at the antipodes of each other. R. Guénon stigm atizes “the i gnorance of neo-spiritualists, who seek to locate the extra- corporeal m odalities of the indi vidu al, and place posthum ous states so mewhere in space ”. In sim ple language this signifies that hell, purgatory and paradi se are not p laces , as pu erile Westerners think, but rather st ates. However, simplistic Christ ians and m etaphysicians are both right. Just as every creature is at the sam e tim e an individ ual, a collectivity and an en vironm ent, modes of universal existence are at the sam e tim e places, states and instan taneou s acts. R. Guénon adm its that E noch, Moses, Elijah sa w their corporeal form disappear, “passing com pletely into a subtle state, or perhaps an unm anifest state”. The atom s of M oses’ body, dissociated by an unknown ag ent, were unable to fall into ob livion; they were transm uted, but som ewhere else, perh aps in another space. So ar e t he st ages of del ivery ar e not al ways metaphysical states; that they lo cate them selves thus? And, if th e existence of the Delivered One “passes bey ond all forms, and is d ilated b eyond al l lim its, b ecause h e has realized the plen itude of his possibilities”, how can we reco ncile this co nclu sion with the preceding one? 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"For, if the Deliver ed One liv es ou tside of all f orm , all m easure and a ll tim e, all the undelivered live in form , m easure and tim e. It is these latter who experience the purgatories, the paradises of the asceticism, of the hells of stupefaction. The Delivered One is “freed from conditions of individu al h uman existence, as well as all other particular and lim iting c onditions... He is an om nipresen t consciousness... m anifesting transcendent faculties ”. Should we understand th at this Delivered One no longer feels hunger, thirst, nor sleepiness, and that he reads thoughts; in short, that the veils of m atter no longer exis t for him and that he com mands all, sowing m iracles? W e are now a long way from metaphysics. Our author takes care to inform us, and wi th good reason, that such results are “partial, secondary and contingent;... thes e are the m eans”. Union, true De liverance, is found outside of Being, in non-condition, and is acquired thro ugh constantly fixing one ’s thought on this Uncondition . Rites, esoteric prac tice s are on ly non indisp ensable aids. But it f ollo ws f rom that that the Christian who serves the Word through constant obeisance and unstinting love cannot rise up higher than the Word: the Being exists trough Hi m: whereas the m etaphysician, for whom the Supreme Princip le still sits above the W ord, unm anifest, hol ds h is asceticism to be m ore sublim e: for him , action cannot lead to the Unm anifest; only Knowledge can lead there. In conclusion knowledge leads us, from gro ss for ms to subtle form s, to m etaphysical abstraction. Action leads us, from covetous existence to shining ex istence, to life eternal. I prefer the second road. Then – and please forgiv e m e for restating it – the inconvenience of theoretical conclusions m eans th at we cannot judge far off thi ngs except through som e kind of inductive argum ent. No doubt a paleontologist 2 can reconstitute the whole physiognomy of some antediluvian anim al from a bone; but can im ages in a Museum give the sam e living concept that the sight of this anim al gave to our cave-dwelling ancestors in fo rm er times ? So I claim that it is rash to say that Hindu Ananda, Taoist Vide, Bu ddhist Nirvana, the Muslim Sekinah, the Jewish Shekinah, the Rosicrucian Pax Profunda, the Chri stian Glorious Light are the sam e thing. In order to promulgate such this affirm ation, one would have needed to follow to its conclusion each of thes e afore-m entioned schoo ls, and then h ave com pared the fruits. To conclude, do not expect to get from each m ethod wha t it can pro vide. Meditation, action, devotion offer to different types of seeker their own resour ces; b ut they do n ot equa te at all, nor do they lead to the sam e summit. And, when all is said and done, nothing replaces love for one’s neighbor. *** And thus hum anity, since that distant day when God sent it into the world, walks by trial and erro r to wards the F ather ’s House.

Before beginning the study of the Rose-Croix, let us say a few wor ds about secret societies. In every age, within or w ithout officially recognized currents of thought, secret societies have existed. These are m anifestations, as a te mporary principle, of the unknown guardians of prim ordial T radition. W ronski, in his book Messia nisme , lays out the aim s of what he calls “m ystical as sociations” as follows: 1 To participate in the m arch of Cr eation by confining, m ateria lizing, or incarnating, if it dare be s aid, absolute reality through the ex ercis e of feelings and supernatural acts ; 2 To partic ipate in th is m arch of Creation particularly on the earth, by directing the destinies of our planet, being religious and political as m uch as econom ic and intellectual. And he adds: “Being unable to practice or discuss in public the supernatural efforts made by m ystical association s to particip ate in Creatio n, not leas t b ecause th e p ublic would laugh at them ; being no longer able to openly lead terrestr ial destinies, use the means of secret societ ies. And so, as one may now com e to realiz e, it is in th e f ield of my stic ism that all th e sec ret societies which have existed and which still e xist on our globe are born; all of which, being ripened by these m ystical resources, have dom inated and still continue to dom inate the world, d espite th e e xisten ce of governm ents. “These secret societies, created whenever th ere has been a need, ar e detached from one another, in distinct bands wh ich in appearance oppose one anot her, respectively professing in turn the m ost contrary opinions of the day, in order to separa tely and conf iden tly lead all religious, econom ic and literary pa rties; and, so that they m ay receive common directions, they are linked to an unknown center, where the pow erfu l resource which invisibl y seeks to m ove all the scepters of the earth, lies hidden”. Finally, in order to leave nothing out, let us remember that it is not only from among those with a superio r in tellec tual cap acity tha t se cret soc ieties do the ir rec ruiting ; on th e contrary, the vas t m ajority of the ir m embers com e from be low, from the beaten -down classes. The m ass of those who toil for a derisory salary, those se rvants who of necessity subm it to constant hum iliations , those whose dream s of higher things who are brutally beaten down at every step they m ake in life, all th ese try to es cape their sorrows through voluntary st upefaction; or through that resignation which procures for them the help of religion; or at lengt h through their belief in the Im possible, their intuition of the Beyond, the s ecret m over of all those who give them selves over to the study of occult knowledge. In the la tter case, they have chosen an even harder path. T hey will f orget the ir ea rlier suf ferings in devoting them selves to other an d even m ore bitte r sorr ows.

Outside of the yellow sun which lights us, th ere are six other still invisible suns w hich give life to the earth. Our yellow sun is n charge of the assimila tion of vital functions. Another sun, the red sun, has the construction of terrest rial bodes as its offi ce; it governs morphology, physical, chem ical, intellectual and social affinities. This red sun is the residence of being that Paracelsus, the first one here below, called Elias Artista. Elias Artista is the angel of the Rose-Cro ix. None can know who he is, even him on whom he rests. Al on e can say is that he is an attractive a nd harm onizing force, and that he works to reunite all individuals into a single hom ogeneous body. This is how Stanislas de Guaita exp resses it: “Elias Artis te is infallible, imm ortal, inacces sible in grow th to im perfections such as starn ishs and the ridicule of m en of flesh who offe r the mselves for his m anifestation.

On the other hand, if we want to look at the priesthood of Melchisedek, whose sacrifice is the pref igur ation of the Eucharist, we will have to rem ind ourselves that the prie sts “af ter th e Order of M elchisedek” did not co nstitu te a s ocial order, but a p ries thood whose sacram ent, represented by the bread and wine, is the sacrifice of him self for his neighbor, for love of Jesus Christ and through union with Him . In our opinion, Elias Artista is an adaptation of the biblical Elias, w ho must return at the end of tim e, with Enoch, to f ulfill their ro le as witnesses in the univers al bina ry. It would be prem ature to say who Elias Artista was, or who he will be. All it is us eful to know, is that th is nam e designates a form of intelligent Spirit.

In the Mid dle Ages, f rom the 13 th to the 14 th Century, m an’s spirit, aspirations and destiny were assuredly unknowable yet full of hope, its soul expressed in the work of Dante. A for m of civilization had disappeared; another had issued forth from the night, which orthodox Christianity, as well as heretica l Christian ity, s tam ped with its im press. Dante gave for m to all these dreams. The work of Dante has given rise to innum erable comm entaries. To stay within the confines of our study, we will point out that E. Aroux 11 asked the question: W as Da nte Catholic or Albigens ian ? He dra ws attention to the link s that Dante had with the Albigensian Gnostic sects, adversaries of the papacy and the Church of Rom e; and he rem inds us that the eighth heaven of Paradis e, the starry heaven, is the h eaven of the Rose-Croix, a nd that there the parf aits clothed in white profess “the evangelical doctrine”, that of Luther, opposed to the Catholic doctrine of Rom e. Eliphas Lév i (9) declares that: “The work of the great Gibelin is a d eclaration of war against the papacy thro ugh the daring revelation of m yste ries; Dante’s epic is Johannite and Gnostic – and the heroes of the The Divine Comedy escape Hell by taking the opposite view to dogm a”. – I n reality, Dante never “revealed” m yster ies or, if he did, it is under so veiled a for m that only those w ho know these m ysteries c ould understand. In the sam e way he never took “the opposite view to dogm a”; he never stopped being Cat holic, in the traditional sense of this word. If he is sho wn to be an adversary of the papacy, it is so lely in the political realm and because he reproached the successor of St. Peter for reso rtin g too frequently to tem poral m eans – which is the task of the outer order. The desire, which D ante som etim es expressed with f orce, to s ee the maintenance of links between the temporal and spiritual powers m anaged by the authorities of these respective dom ains, is proof of the orthodoxy of his Catholicism . Dante was one of the heads of the Fede Santa , th ird Or der of the Tem plar lin e 12 . Moreover, there was a certain link between Dante and the Muslim trad ition, with which, as w e shall see, th e Rosicrucia n tradition was united. Miguel Asin Palacios (10) has emphasized the most intere sting sim ilarities be tween The Divine Comedy and the theses of one of t he greatest Moslem writers, Mohyiddin ibn Arabi.   11 E.

Nevertheless, he occupi ed an honorable place in the pha lanx of those who have fought against hypocrisy and excess, and who have recommended a loyal and w holesom e life. Eliphas Lévi, researching the earthly, hum an ro ots of the Rose-Croix, expressed it thus: “The rose which, throughout tim e, has been the em blem of beau ty, life, love and pleasure, mystically expressed the secret thought of all the protests manifested in the Renaissance. It was flesh revolted by the oppression of the spirit; it wa s nature declaring itself the daughter of God, as grace ; it was lif e which didn’t wa nt to be ste rile; it was hum anity aspiring to natural religion, full of reason and love, founded on the revelation of the harmonies of being, of which the rose, for initiates, was the living and flourishing sym bol. “In fact the rose is a pentacle... T he conque st of the rose was the problem posed by initiation into knowledge, while re ligion worked to prepare and es tablish the universal, exclusive and definitive trium ph of the cross... “Reuniting the rose an d the cros s, such was the p roblem posed by high in itiation... Religion is the revelation and satisfaction aris ing from the soul’s need. Nobody invented it; it was f orm ed by the ne ces sities of m oral lif e; it is both m ortal and divine. Thus, the true natural religion is revealed religion... “It is throug h speaking of this rigor ously r atio nal pr inc iple that the Rose-Croix came to respect the dom inant, hierarchic , revealed religion.

We don’t know in general to what extent th e world and the profane Church were shaped by occult currents. Catharism had penetrated the clergy of the M iddle Ages at an early stage. Albert le Grand, his pupil St. Thom as Aquinas, Pierre le Lombar d, Richard de Saint-Victor, St. Francis of Assisi, St. Claire, th e entire Thir d Order professed Gnostic doctrines. “The Third Order still exists; but it had to lose – and, in fact , it lost its original ch aracter com pletely. In the beginning, such as the Order organized by St. Franci s, such as the e mperors of Ge rm any fought against, was not only a pious brotherhood intendi ng to reunite som e elite souls in the sam e prayer; it was a gigantic associa tion which em braced the wh ole of Italy, and shortly thereafte r all of Christianity, whose m embers, requiring cer tain uncom mon religious practices, above all im posed the obligation to work vigorously and together on political works 13 . And, in fact, one may say that, in m any regards, it was the Third Order which conquered feudalism , and the Third Order which gave ris e to the Third Es tate ”. The Chivalric novels are an unexplored m ine of teachings on the m ysterious h isto ry of our country; and René G uénon 14 think s tha t “the tr ue orig in of Rosicruc ianism are the Orders o f Knights who, in the Middles Ages, forged true in tellectual links between th e East and the W est”. But the true precurso rs of the Rose-Croix ar e th ose who created th e spiritual atm osphere in which the Rose-Croix was able to m anif est its elf. W e can only m ention som e of the principal ones. The m ystic works published in the 5 th Century under the nam e of Denys the Areopagite taught th at God is One, the Unm anifest. All things proceed from Hi m, from His love. This lov e is a unif ying force which urges high er thing s to c are f or th e lower, and in cline s the lo wer to ar ise to the higher. Many reaches God through understa nding, but above all through love which is the reflection of God, and through the ecstasy which absorbs him in transfor ming unity. This love for God is manifested here below by the love that creatures m ust have for each other. Joachim de Flore (1132-1202) preached reform ation of the clergy, affirming that it is not though knowledge that m an ever com es to God, but through purity of life and through love. Founded on two sentences of St. John 15 , Joachim de Flore divided th e history of the world into three periods: the reign of the Father, which ran from Ada m to Hosiah, king of Judah; the reigns of the Son, which ran from Hosiah to the tim e of Joachim ; then m ust com e the reign of the Holy Spirit, prec eded by a rev olution am ong the souls w ho will cle anse the Ch urch of its s tains and a t the threshold of which the prophet E lias shall reappear.   13 Th e au thor add s in a no te: “A fun ction of the Th ird Or der was t o con stitu te an immen se arm y, who se purpose was to bring a bout greater justice and equality am ong m en”.

The reciproc al love of the Son and the Fath er, of God and the world is the Holy Spirit. True knowledge of God is union with Hi m. This union is thus the highest function of the Spir it. Jean Ruysbroeck the Adm irable (1293-1381), the disciple of Master Eckhart, the illum inated author of, among other works, the Ornement des Noces Spirituelles and the Royaume des amants de Dieu , brings the soul to God through th e battle for perfection. “You know how iron is so penetrated by f ire that under its action it be haves just like fire, bu rning and shining like it. However, each elem ent preserv es its own n ature, and fire does not becom e iron an y m ore than iron becom es fire. But the union is m ade without in term ediary, since iron is contained within fire and fire within iron”. To one of his m onks who rem arked to him that, by writing about such profound subjects, he would attract both envy and de tractors, he replied: “In trut h, I have written nothing of m y books, if not in presence of the Most Holy Trinity”. – For him inspiration never eclipsed the ascetic; he constantly repeated that only preparation by practici ng the virtues leads to knowledge. Above all he knew joy. Michelet, in a fam ous page, characterized the Middle Ages thus: “Faith, hope, charity, these are tru ly three div ine virtues. But we m ust add this rare and sublim e virtue in truly pure hearts, rare eve am ong the saints. For want of a better nam e, I wi ll call it joy.

They loved m uch, but they rem ained sad and worried”. R uysbroeck had j oy. But he believed that the disciple of Christ could bring this supernatural j oy to its highest level by being pr epared to renounce it for love of his brothers. “If you are en raptured by an ecstasy”, he said, “as great as that of St. Peter or St. Paul or whoever you will, and if you learn that a sick perso n has need of war m soup, I counsel you to wake up from your ecstasy and warm th e soup.

They n ever lived long in th e sam e place, and went about th eir business without attr acting attention”. Karl Kiese wetter, in a n artic le in L’Initiation , gave the following teachings: “In the Theatrum Chem icum (e d. of 1613, p. 1028), a bishop of Trèves in the 16 th Century, the com te de Falkenstein, was na med illus trissimu s et seren issimus princeps et pater philosophoru m .

In this association Fludd saw a presage of th e Rose-Croix; but the words of Agrippa are too general to conclude the certa inly of a lineage f rom them . Von Murr p ossessed so me che mical co rrespon dence between Crollius, Zatzer, Scherer and Heyden, Cha mberlain of Em peror Rudolph II, spanning 1594 to 1596. No mention is m ade of an Rosicrucian society (11). In 1608, the alchem ist Benedict Figulus, in the Thesaurin ella chymic a aurea trip artita , dedicated to Em peror Rudolph II, in serted an elegy to Jean-Baptis te von Seebach, alchem ist, in which he prophesized, like Paracelsus, the com ing of Elias Artista. This was an event which h e considered to be m ost important, for he adds: “This the Christ shall es tablish a state of new things upon the earth”. The Apologie (12) shows that before 1600 or 1603 som e herm etic societies or fraternities were known, but no Rosicrucian Fraternities. Stanislas de Guaita used a resem blance be tween Rosicrucian sym bols on the one hand, and a pentacle form the Amphitheatrum sapientiae aeternae (13) where Khunrath, in 1598, had drawn Chris t, arm s in th e form of a cross, in a rose of light and a figure of the Pron ostica tion of Paracelsus (1536) on the other, to affir m that “The Rose-Croix, whose constituent em ble ms ta ke us back to the poem s of Dante and Guillaum e de Lorr is, ha d opera ted in the sh ado ws f or a lon g tim e before m anifesting itself through works perform ed in the light of day” (7).

How to reunite the ros e and the cross was the problem posed by high initiation”. The white r ose, m ore particula rly dedica ted to the Virg in Mary, to Holda, to Fre ya, to Venus-Uranus, was the sym bol of silence and prayer (17). A.E. W aite teaches us that the ros e was alread y used in the sym bolism of the Brahm an legends. In one of the Hindu paradises, there is a silver rose which cont ains the im age of two wom en shining like pearls. They appear united or separated depending on whether th ey are seen from the sky or earth. F rom the celestial viewpoin t she is called the godde ss of the mouth; from the terrestrial view, the goddess or spirit of language. God resides in the center of this rose.

The author of Summum Bonum (19) whom one has good reason to think was Robert Fludd, said that the letters F.R.C. signified Fait h, Religion, Charity and that the sym bol of the Rose-Croix represented the wood of Calv ary vivified by the blood of Christ. Dr. Ferran gave the following explanation: “After trian gular em blem s, the seal of Brah atm a and the triangle of the holy syllable, the most ancient Masonic emblem which the ancient priesthood has bequeathed is that of the Rose- Croix. “The latter, attributed to T hoth-Herm es, ca me to us from the tem ple of Egypt via the Chaldees, a com pulsory interm ediary, seeing th at it cam e f rom am ong the m ages within the confines of the Tigris and th e Euphrates, after Ca mbyses, follo wing the conquest of Egypt, had transported all the priests of this country, w ith no exception and with no hope of returning. “For initiate s, the Rose-Croix perso nified th e divine idea of the m anifestation of life through the two term s which com pose this emblem . The first, the rose, represents the m ost perfect sym bol of liv ing unity ; firstly b ecause this flower, m ultiple in its unity, presen ts a spherical form, sym bol of infinity; in the s econd place, b ecau se the perfu me it exhales is know n as a revelation of life. “This rose was placed in the cen ter of a cross, because the la tter expressed to them the idea of rectitude and infinity; of rectitude, by the intersection of its lines at a right angle and of infinity, because these lines can be extended to infinity and that, by a rotation m ade by the thought about the vertical line, they represent th e triple senses of hei ght, breadth and depth”. (20). The sam e ideas were e xpressed by the seer who was Villiers de l' Isle -Adam , in whose soul blossom ed all the lights summoned by the works of a line of Christian ancestors. “This talisman of the stellar Cross is pene trated by an energy capable of m astering the violence of the elem ents. Diluted by m any on this earth, this sign – in its f ull spir itua l gravity – expresses and consecrates to m en’s profit the prophetic knowledge of num bers, the m ajesty of crowns, the beauty of sorrows. It is the em ble m of authority which the Spirit secretly revealed as a being or a thing. It estab lishes, it redeem s, it throws on e on one’s knees, it enlightens!... Profaners them selves bow before him. He who resi sts it is its slav e. May the igno rant stup idly suffer forever from this contem pt. Everywhere it rises, ignored by the children of that age, yet inevitable. “The Cross is the form Man takes when he ex tends his arm s towards his desire or resigns him self to hi s destiny.

Let us recall the rose-croix shield of Lu ther: a heart pierced by a cross surrounded by a rose with the device: Th e heart of Christians rests upon roses wh en it is at the foot of the cross 20 ; that of J aco b Andreae: a St. Andr ew’s cross with a ros e in each qu arter; and the p assage in th e Chemical Wedding following which Christian Rosenkreutz, at the instan t of leaving the king ’s wedding, ties a red ribbon on his hom espun robe in m emory of Jesus C hrist and stick four roses in his hat as a sign of recognition.

Va lentin Tschirness, philo sopher et licentiate in medicine at Goerlitz, declared: “The public is no t correct wh en it calls us Rosenkreutzer, for the nam e of the father of our sect. The reason our founder was so na med, we keep secret and have never published” (23). In Themis aurea (18) Michae l Ma ier sa id: “O ne explains R.C. by Rosenkreutz and however the Brothers th em selves declared that th ey were called Rosicrucians inco rrectly, for the letters R.

Thus, he was none other than Solom on who was the founder of this Society, for the doctrines existed before their hum an representative.” (24) . Finally, Maier ( Silentium post clamores ) (25) suggested the Rose -Croix descended from the Brahm ans, the Eumolpidae of E leusis, the G ymnosophists of Ethiopia, etc. The anonymous work Colloquium Rhodostauroticum (2 6) declares : “However, in his opinion”: “If their founder hadn’t been Christian Rose nkreutz and if they i nvented the nam e, it is because, for them , the sons of God, the cross has been chan ged in this existen ce into a beautiful bloom ing rose”. As for their m eeting place, the Fama had said: “Since we shall rev eal n eithe r the na mes, nor the place of our m eetings, m essages which ar e add ress ed to us, in whatever language, will com e to us”. Julianus d e Cam pis, in a Letter which had been inserted into the 1616 edition of the Fam a, said: “There is no assem bly which m eets in one p lace”. Later he adds: “We live in a monastery build by the father, and called Sancti Spiritus . We live there in common, wearing a robe which conceals us, in the m iddle of th e trees and fores ts in th e cou ntry, and by a s ilen t and well-known river.

Michel Maier devoted h is Themis aurea (18) to an exposé of the m undane laws adopted by the Rose-Croix. As the senary is a perfect nu mber, neither too large to create confusion, nor inferior to harm ony, and since that which follows nature should obey sim ple laws, the adepts accepted six rules, being : 1 st ) That no ne am ong them , if he is trav eling, w ill declare any other prof ession than that of healing the sick, and that gratis ; 2 nd ) That no ne should be forced, by reason of h is a ffiliation, to d ress in special cloth ing, but that he should adopt the habits of the c ountry in which he finds him self; 3 rd ) That each Brother is bound each year, on the day C 22 , to com e to the Tem ple of the Holy Spirit, o r declare in a letter the caus e of his absen ce; 4 th ) That each Brother must carefully choose an ap t and sk illful person to succeed his after h is death; 5 th ) That the word R.C. will se rve as their sea l, password and signatu re; 6 th ) That this Fraternity be hidden for one hundred years. And he continued: “The funda mental rules of this Society are to revere and fear God above all things; to do everything possible which is good for his neighbor; to rem ain honest and moderate; to drive away the devil; to be c ontent with the least th ings for nourishm ent and clothing, and to be asham ed of vice... It is pu erile to reproach them for not keeping their prom ises, for m any are called and few are chosen; the m asters of the Rose-Croix sh ow the Rose from far off, but they present the Cross... They most desire the reform ation of the s ciences and the world which they don’t expect; their m ain area of study, therapeutics , has three objects: body, spirit and soul”. According to Fludd, the Brothers were divided into two classes. Th e first were entitled Aureae crucis fratres , containing the theosophe rs; the second were the Rosae crucis fratres , who restricted their research to s ublunary things. Fludd would have belonged to the first category (12). At the head of the Fraternity is an Imperator, elected by th e Brothers for ten years. The Clypeum ver itatis (29) had the order of succession of the Im peratores go back to Adam . The author adds, in the guise of a warning: “Many of our cl ients and our disciples then rise up against m e; in our Fraternity we have had, and now have and protect popes, cardinals, bishops, abb ots, em perors, lords.

Of Ger man nationality, and born of a nobl e but im poverished fam ily, Christian Rosencreutz soon becam e an orphan. He was rais ed in a convent where he learn ed Greek and Latin, which he left at the age of sixteen, to travel with an ec cles iastica l brother to Dam s, then to Jerusalem , then to Damcar in Arabia, where he re mained for three years; then he went to Egypt, Libya and F ez where he lived for tw o years. During theses travels he learned from the c ounsel of the sages whose company he kept, a universal harm onic science, which was m ocked by the Eu ropean savan ts to whom he tried to communicate it. Her drew this knowledge from the Liber M . ( Book of the World ) w hich thes e Arab sages had taught him , which he translated from Arabic into Latin, and which enclosed the wisdom of Ada m, Moses and S olom on, and which was also known to a certain Th. B. Theophrastus, who was not a m ember of the Fr aternity, but who str ongly supported the founder in his efforts. He conceive d a plan of universa l ref orm : political, relig ious, scientif ic and artis tic, whose realization led him to abandon al l riches which could be obtain ed through the tr ansm utation of metals. Afte r working alone for five years, he join ed with three brothers of his for mer m onastery in Germ any: G.V., I.A. and I.O. He inst ructed his collaborat ors in a house called Sancti Spiritus . There they healed the sick and m ade known the pr inciples and aim of their Society. L ater on, the Father added Brother R.

To the 1614 edition of the Fama is added a “ reply” written by Ada m Haselm ayer, public secretary of Archduke Maxim ilien, to the m embers of the Rose Croix 34 . He said that, being in the Tyrol in 1610, he had received a manuscrip t co py of the Fa ma. He spoke enthusiastically abou t the Fraternity, asked the Brethren to m anifest them selves in or der to teach the world knowledge of the Messiah and to announce that light which mu st com e in the tim e of the reign of the Holy Spirit, for in the imm ediate future must com e grave events: the fall of the pope, adversary of Jesus Christ, and of his partisans, an d the com ing of Christ trium phant. We should add that, from the commencem ent of the Refo rmation , on should note that the idea of universal reform was not a thought original to the Rose Croix, but that it was only a restating of a pam phlet by Trajano Boccalini : Ragguagli di Parnasso ( News from Parnassus ), published in Venice in 1612. In any case, at the tim e that the oldest Rosicrucian docum ents were appearing, there was a contem porary belief in an imm inent general revolution. A m ore total reform even than that of Luther was spoken of, one which would precede the end of the world . In 1615 a second brochure appeared to com plem ent the Fama : Confessio Fraternitatis Rosae Crucis.

Its contents confor ms with that of the Fama , though with a more accen tuated poin t which is both apocalyptic and antipapal. It speaks with m ore precision about global reform ation, and above all it reveals the nam e of the founder of the Frater nity: he was cal led Christian Rosencreutz, and states that he was born in 1378 and that he lived for one hundred and six years. Form ed under a direction by the Spirit, the So ciety had as its aim to bring back an age of happiness after the Satu rnine night. Then that wh ich was concealed would be revealed; lies and falsehood would disappear. On that great day the Fraternity w ould reve al all its secret s.

They would suffer ne ither hunger nor poverty nor sickness ; their lives would endure forever. They would comm unicate with the Indies and with Peru; and could read in a single book everything containe d in the past, present and futu re.

THE CHEMICAL WEDDING OF CHRISTIAN ROSENCREUTZ In 1616, under the name of its author, the Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosencreutz (30)appeared. In his Autobiography (31), Jean-V alentin Andreae decl ared that h e had com posed this book w hen he was fift een years old , around 1601. In his letter, this trea tise is an quite d etailed e xpo sé of the m etallic work ing; in its spirit it describes the rising up of the soul, by degrees, towards illum ination. This book is attribu ted to Christian Rosencreu tz which he would have written in 1459. He recounts, ov er the course of seven days, th e marriage of the king, then his decapitation and finally his resurrection. It is be caus e of an invita tion th at the king addresses to him to attend his weeding cerem onies that Rosencreutz sets out on his way, with a profound sense of his unworthiness.

A fe w years younger than hi m, Michael Maier in Ger many a nd Robert Fludd in England were the m ost rep resen tative peop le of the Rosicrucian m ovem ent in the 17th Century. Michael Maier (1568-1622) was an alchem ist of renown. He becam e the personal physician of Em peror Rudolph II, who gave him the title of Count Pa latine and Im perial Counselor. In 1617 in Fr ankfurt, he published Silentium post clamores (25), in which he praised the Rose-Croix for having responded with silence to the pamphlets of all sorts published for or agains t th em ; and besides th e adv ersaries of the Rose-Croix were “b awlers who wanted to be received into the Fraternity but who had not recei ved a response. ” He reve aled that, at all tim es and am ong all peoples, colleges of philosophy have existed where m edicine and the secrets of nature were studied. Th ese secrets were tran sm itted from generation to generation by way of initiation. Maier exp lain ed that th ese colleg es were institu ted for the teaching of the secrets of nature and not for the propagation of esoteric doc trin es. The Rose-Croix ha d had reason to revea l its existence through the Fama and the Confessio , which said well what they had to say without running counter to reason, nature and experience. And he declared that the true Rose-Croix were outside of s pace and tim e: that they saw into th e innerm ost part of pe oples’ hearts; that, in consequence, nobody should concern them selves over a final affiliation which can only be decided outside of him self. More over, the F raternity had reason to observe strict silence, which alone could protect it against profanation by the vulgar. Maier affirm ed that: “of six thousand candidates the Fraternity has chosen hardly one.” And he added: “Many are called , but few are chosen. The m asters of the Rose-Croix show the rose, but they offer the cross. They prove the best candidates by m eans of a silence of five year s in order to dom inate their passions and their words.”   40 Vide sup ra , p. 28.

The m ost curious of his works is Atalanta fugiens (33) in w hich, by m eans of e mblem s, he treats of the secrets of nature. Buhle reports that in 1620, Maier went to Engl and where he did active advertising for the Fraternity of the Rose-Croix. It is pos sible that he m et Robert Fludd there. After his death, his treatise Ulysses (34) was published by one of his personal friends. He declared that he did not know whether Maier, who had defended the cause of the Rose-Croix with such passion and disinterest, had ever been received am ong th em , but he was certain that he was a Brother of the Christian Religion, that is to say without any doubt of the Fraternity of Christ founded by J.-V. Andreae. *** Robert Fludd (1574-1637) was one of the m ost singular m inds of his epoch. At Oxford he studied literature, philosophy, m athem atics, theology and m edicine. Then he traveled to France, Italy and Germ any. At Oxford he obtained the grade of Doctor of Medicine. He possessed an encyclopedic knowledge; he was renowned throughout E urope both as a philosopher, doctor, anatom ist, p hysician, ch em ist, astro loger, m athem atician and engineer. While showing him self an advocate of the doctrines of the Kabbalah, whose m ysteries he had probed , he loved exact sciences and , in every field in which he exerci sed his vast activity, dem onstrated a real ability for observation. He was the invent or of the barom eter and constr ucted m achines which were the adm iration of his contemporaries. His philosophy is essentia lly religious. God is the principl e, the end, the sum of all that exists. The entire universe tout com es from Hi m, it is form ed of His substance and will return to him . God, passing eternally through the archetypal world where He reveals Him self to Him self through the Macro cosm (nature); and through th e Microcosm (man) offers, acco rding to the expression of Trism egistus, the im age of “ a sphere whose center is everywhere and circum ference nowhere.” God reveale d prim ordial W isdom to the f irst man and this was then tra nsm itted by the Patriarchs, Prophets, Wise Men an d, m ore recentl y, by th e Brothers of the Rose-Croix.

Alchem y consists of leading the adept to the s tate of perfection from which Adam fell 41 . The philosopher and physician Gassendi claimed to refute Fludd in his Exercitatio in Fluddanam Philosophiam , Paris, 1630.

Kepler the astronom er also wrote to com bat his theories. However th e experim ental m ethod used by Fludd, by its mathe matical rigor, recalls the prin ciples of natural philosophy by Newton. Fludd wrote m any works vehem ently de fending the Rose-Croix, notably the Apologetic Treatise (1617) (35) and, under the nam e of Joachim Frizzio, The Sovereign Good (1628). (19) Like Maier, Fludd declared th at he was not Rose-Croix. *** Theophilus Schweighardt, of Constance, is one of the great apostles of the Rose-Croix. His Mirror of Rosicrucian Wisdom (27) is of capital im portance. There he explains well the true character of the Rosi crucian undertaking: “See here r epresen ted all the ar t of the world, all its kno wledge and all its expe rtis e: however, seek first the kingdom of God.” “Ora et labora.” “If you do not unders tan d m y sincere lessons, yo u will not un derstand any book.” “Many people, belonging to all classes of societ y, inquire insistently a bout this F raternity. Few days would pass in Frankfurt, Leipzig, in other places, but a bove all in Prague, where ten, twelve and even twenty people wouldn’t com e toge ther to talk about thes e things, not counting those autho ritativ e peo ple who persevere in thei r work together. However, they have been betray ed by false broth ers; this is why the author decid ed to bring to the light of day the spirit and regulations of this College.

He struck up a friendship with a Venetian lo rd, a widower and father of a rem arkably beautiful and intelligent young daughter. This gen tlem an wished to see Gualdi’s paintings. The latter showed his collect ion to the father and hi s daughter; they were adm iring all the pictures in detail, and were about to retire when the gentle man, on raising his eyes, perceived a portrait of Gualdi with certain characteris tics h e recognized a being from Titian. Now at this tim e Titian had been dead for alm ost two hundred years, yet the stranger seem ed to have only reached his forties.

This incident was told about the city, and, when several peopl e desired to s ee this strange, Signor Gualdi had left V enice taking th e key to his gallery with him . *** Dr. Robert Plot (51) told the following story: A far mer, digg ing a trench in a field, struck at a shallow depth with a pick axe a large rectangular stone wh ich, once cleared of grass and moss, revealed a large iron ring riveted to its center. Believing he had discovered the hiding place of a treasure, after m any attempts he raised this ston e, and discovered a large ex cavation in which a stone staircase led downw ards. After som e hesitation, he descended the st eps, and found him self plunged into deep shadow s, but which darkness appeared to lighten from a distant glow. At a depth of around one hundred feet, he found him self in a square cell fr om which led a long corridor; after walking along it, he descended anot her staircase of two hundred twenty-two steps, trying out each step before risking it, surrounded by darkness; only a light arom atic odor wafted past in puffs in the cold, subte rranean air. Exploring the room there the second staircase ended, he found hi mself on the right of a third staircase, at the bottom of which was a pale unm oving light. Though he was a little frightened, he set of f on this third descent. T he walls becam e da mp and the steps slippery as if no foot wal ked t hem si nce far-off tim es. He heard a heavy m urmur, like a distant gallop; the light was now visible near by. Fear increased in our hero little by little and if was only with the greatest trepidation tha t he continued his descent. At one turn of the staircase he suddenly saw a great sq uare cham ber, with a low-lying roof ; in each corner, a black stone rose was sculpted, and a golden light like th at of the rising sun, cl early illum inating the person of the stupefied explorer. But his astonish ment changed into terror when he saw a m an seated in a stone pulpit, reading a great book placed on a kind of r ectangular altar, lit by a large antique lamp of iron. A cry of surprise which our farm er could not contain m ade the seated m an turn towards him ; he stood up and, with an expre ssion of anger, gestured to him that he was forbidden to enter the cham ber; but, as the new arrival did not react to th is injunction, with a blow of an iron wand which he held in his hand, he broke the old lam p which broke into a thousand pieces, leaving the place in profound darkness. 45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" Heavy rumblings seemed to pass along dist ant corridors.

A century had not passed by than everything had changed. The all-m ystic ideas of the firs t Ros icrucian writings were replaced by the disciplin e of secrecy, austere anonym ity, the distancing of beau ty, celibacy, a cold a nd disdainful charity, years of effort towards an unknown goal. More and more those who wanted to serve in the nam e of the Rose-Croix conf ined them selves to the study of al chemy and m agic. Our personal teachings perm it us to say that the m ove ment of 1714 was already polluted by its head, although his subordinate m embers sought truth w ith a sp irit of liberty and very great sincerity. The Silesian pastor Samuel Richter, whos e pseudonym was Sincerus Renatus, published a work (in Germ an ) in 1710: The true and perfect Preparation of the Philosophical Stone of the Fraternity of the Orde r of the Gold en Cro ss and the Rosy Cross , whose appendix contained a code in 52 articles. Here there is no spiritua l consideration; only th e disposition of narrow legality; a ritual without great ness, often burlesque signs of recognition. The Order com prised Brothers of the Golden Cross of Gold and Brothers of the Rosy Cross. At its head an Im perator elected by seniority and for life; every ten years he changed in great secrecy his nam e, hi s residence and his pseudonym . The Order, consisting of 21 m embers, was com posed of at least 23 brother s, 63 at m ost. The brothe rs were adm itte d af ter th ree m onths apprenticesh ip and if they had perform ed m any operations. They were requi red to preach a serm on.

The cobbler-theosopher, w ho was one of the m ost powerful metaphysical geniuses of hum anity, never claim ed to write new things: ev erything he said could be found in the Scriptures and in the school of N ature. Also, to understand it, one should take on the true religion: to im itate and follow Jesus, “t he spiritual P hilosophical Stone”, in his sufferings and in his death, in order to be resurrected with him. Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin was turned from the study of occult sc ience and turn ed to mystical knowledge by Rodolphe Salzm ann, who in troduced him to the work of Jacob Boehm e.

He spread th e writings of Boehm e in m any countries in Europe. Sim ultaneously, two writers were introduced to Boehm e in England: his friend Joachim Morsius, a Rosicrucian, whose pseu donym was Anastasius Philaretus C osm opolita; and W illiam Law, author of beautiful mystical works. Another disciple of Jacob Boehme, Jean Georges Gichtel, born mystic, apostle of renunciation, had a revelation of the Celestial Vi rgin, Sophia, which confirm ed hi m in Christic poverty and led him to know the m ysteries of interior and ex terior nature.

Around 1909 Max Heindel founded the Rosicrucian Fellow ship , “School of Philosophy and Healing” where astrology wa s also taught. The first headqua rters of the Society was in Seattle.

However, “barely in a thous and years has there been bor n a single m an who could pass through the for midable gates whic h lead to the worlds of beyond” 57 . First of all the discip le is taught how to hold his ton gue; the m ost capable people are adm itted in to the secret grades only after con tin uous observ ation of at least five years. Even the uneducated are accepted, as long as th ey are honest and discreet (25). And Micha el Ma ier a dds: For th e Rose-Cro ix to accep t a studen t, his d esire for knowledge and good will m ust have received confirm ation by an illum inative m anifestation (18 ). We should note here that Maie r represents above all the Pythagorean side of this tradition. “A Society exists whos e statutes an d m ysterie s are an im penetrab le se cret for th e most curious and m ost profound of the erudite.

From the point of view of the sym bolic developm ent of m agical powers, one can fruitfully study the Akedysseril by Villiers de l' Isle -Adam . The f ollowing pages of Zanoni will show the rest; and, finally, the Annonciateur by the same Villiers will unveil som e of the ultim ate pur poses of a soul tr ained in this schoo l. “But first, to penetrate this barrier, the soul with which you listen m ust be sharpened by intense enthusiasm , purified from all earthlier desires. Not wit hout reason have the so-styled magicians, in a ll land s and tim es, ins isted on chas tity and abs temious reverie as the communicants of inspiration. W hen thus prepare d, science can be brought to aid it; the sight itself m ay be rendered more subt le, the n erve s more acute, the sp irit m ore a live and outward, an d the e lem ent itse lf—the a ir, the spa ce— may be ma de, by certain secrets of the higher chem istry, more palpable and clear. And this , too, is not magic, as the credulous call it; as I have so ofte n said bef ore, m agic (or scienc e that violate s Nature) ex ists not: it is but the scien ce by which Nature can be controlle d. Now, in space the re are millions of beings not litera lly s piritual, for they have all, like the anim alculae unseen by th e naked eye, certain form s of m atter, though matter so delicate, air-drawn, and subtle, that it is, as it were, but a film , a gossam er that clothes the spirit. Hence the Rosicrucian’s lovely phant om s of sylph and gnome. Yet, in truth, these races and tribes differ more wi dely, each from each, than th e Calm uc fr om the Greek,—differ in attributes and powers. In the drop of water you see how the anim alculae vary, how vast and terrible are som e of those m onste r mites as com pared with others. Equally so with the inhabitants of the atm osphere: some of surpassing wisdom, som e of horrib le m alignity; som e hostile as fiends to m en, others gentle as m essengers between earth and heaven. “He who would establish intercourse with th ese varying beings resembles the traveler who would penetrate into unknown lands. He is e xposed to strange dangers and unconjectured terro rs. That intercourse once gained, I cannot secure thee from the chances to which thy journey is expos ed . I cannot direct thee to pa ths free from the wanderings of the deadliest foes. Thou must alone, and of thyself, face and hazard all. Bu t if thou art so enam ored of life as to care only to live on, no m atter for what ends, recruiting the nerves and veins with the alchem ist’s vivifying elix ir, why s eek th ese d angers from the in term edia te tribes ? Because the v ery elix ir th at pou rs a more glor ious lif e into the f ram e, so sharpens th e senses that thos e larvae of the air becom e to thee audible and apparent; so that, unless trai ned by degrees to endure the phantom s and subdue their m alice, a life thus gifted would be the most awful doom m an coul d bring upon him self. Hence it is, that though the elix ir be com pounded of the sim plest herbs, his fram e only is prepared to receive it who has gone through the s ubtlest trials. Nay, som e, scared and daunted into the m ost in tolerab le horro r by the s ights th at burst upon their eyes at the first draft, have found the potion less powerful to save than the agony and travail of Nature to destroy. To the unprepared the elixir is thus but the deadliest poison.

WHAT CAN BE GIVEN. I am that stone rejected by the builders wh ich becam e the keystone of the vault. The death of Christ on the cross is the mystic al death of the ego. (Fr. Hartm ann). One should firstly recognize Christ and be faithful to Him , secondly call upon Mary. Neither Ar istotle, nor Lu ther, no r Rom e, nor m onks will b e usef ul in th is af fair (I ren aeus Agnostus). This is what the autho r of Frater Rosatae Crucis said (57 ): “One com es to Christ m ore quickly by im itating His lif e than by reading a lot. “The Rose-Croix teach the Bible and Tauler.” “He who cannot read”, said Julianus de Cam pis (39), “has only to listen to the preacher. “He m ust not only go towards Christ, but then becom e one wi th Him . “Let us realize the passion of Christ in our heart.” “In m an the re are: body, soul and spirit (1 Thessalonians V, 25 ; 1 Corinthians II, 14 ; Luke I, 46, 47) or three m en: “the sensual m an; “the reasonable m an; “the spiritual m an. “Each m ust bear his cross and, to do this, m ust crucify the first tw o, and pass through the third in humility, despair, death. “The m ore m an rises up, the m ore his cross becom es heavy.” “The colleg e of the Holy Spirit, sa id Schweighardt, is susp ended in the air, where God wills, f or it is He who direc ts it. I t is m obile and immobile, stable and unstable; it moves on its wheels and by its wings; and, t hough the brothers spread Trut h by loud trum pets, Julien de Ca mpis always stands on the other side, arm ed with the sword of exa mination. If you have a bad conscien ce, no bridge, no cord will save you; you will fall into the pits of error much m ore deeply than you had been high, and you will p erish there.

Though Julie n m ay say: “W hat is not apt today will be even less so tom orrow; one canno t fight with force agains t wisdom ”; the hour will com e. “The brothers have the gift of ubiquity ; they are nearer to you than you think. “This tem ple m ust be very sm all, for no brothe r has liv ed the re f or m ore than f our weeks.

Put it into practice in a cont inual m anner; you will be m ore than ha lf Rose-Croix; you will soon find the Magnalia of the Greater and Les ser W orld; soon a brother will appear.

W e for m but one being with Hi m. His spiritual flesh and bl ood are the a lim ent and tin cture which nourishes th e tru e inn er man, for each principle is nourished by its an alo gue: the m ortal body is nourished b y the earth, the sidereal body is nourished by the firm ament, and the soul lives through the Spirit of the Lord.. “The inner m an or the pure dynam ic body, with its celestial fiancée, form s through faith a spiritual essence which is the body of Christ, the tin cture of life, a fiery, penetrating love. It is from spiritu al hum anity that Jesus gave His disciples a body and a celes tial lif e which He brought from Heaven. The law is a fire which reduces nature in cinders, Adam and flesh through suffering and death; the Gospel is a water which spiritu alizes by the grace of Christ and the Spirit and which produces peace, joy, benediction and life.” The Imitation de Jesus Christ remains the m anual for all who aspire to the invisible crown of the Rose-Croix. This book, m odest and fa miliar, whose autho r for centuries has shied away from the adm iratio n of m en, is, after the Ne w Testam ent, the m ost sublim e that Providence has given to the white race. He who would pract ice perfectly all th e counsels it gives, says Schweighar dt, will alre ady be half Rose-Croix. Th e secret virtu e which conf ers on him a divine charm is this unique alliance of the ideal and th e real, this c onti nua l and sublim e descent in to the vulgar ca res of daily lif e, this un inte rrupted eleva tion of the heart which trans figures the commonest actions.

Nothing in the thin f igure, nor in the i rregular features, nor in the placid bearing of this initiato r, point to the sup erhum an ef fort of his will, or the co ntinua lly renewing sufferings from their conscious accep tance. Physic al ugliness seem s to be a comm on trait of being in whom moral splendor is bountiful; as if Heaven wished to give these elit e souls a terrestrial principle so particularly perverse that their light alone must be strong enough for the evolution and harm onization. 66"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" To give an analysis of this great book would be im possible, for everything in it is essential; o ne can on ly find there the th ree great divis ions of m ystic lif e: the purgative, th e illum inativ e and the punitiv e, to each of which is covered in one of its first th ree parts.

For there is such virtu e in the sha dows that a man of sane reason can obtain from the night all that is necessary for himself and for the good of his neighbor; but duty makes it incum bent on him to act th e following day, according to the teach ings given to him , and to walk in the light h e has receiv ed. Thus is it that light can com e out of darkness. So Madathanus recounts how he received the Li ght.

Wom en, courtesans and captains of the Prince-of-Mages file in proces sion around the “Centrum in Trigono Centri”; his nam e was like oil poured out whose perfum e penetrat ed all, and his spirit of fire w as a key to open the T emple, penetra te th e Holy of Holies and se ize the ho rn of the Alta r. Then the dream er’s understanding was opened; he knew th at, behind him , stood a naked woman; she was like the well-beloved of the Shir-ha -shir im (Song of Songs); but in her bosom an open wound poured forth blood and water; her clothes were a bout her feet, torn and covered with mud. Such is occult Nature unveiled, the pure virgin created by Ada m; she lives in the garden; she sleeps in the double cavern of Abraham on th e fields of Ephron and his palace is built n the depths of the Red Sea. The dream er was sorely afraid to be all these things and hea r thes e word s. But Solomon comforted him ; with the sweat of the blood of th e Virgin he cleared hi s understanding and fixed his m emory, in order that he m ight know the gr eatness of the Most High, the height, the depth, the foundation of all of Nature. Then the king took our dream er by the hand, and descended with him into a cellar from where they penetrated into a prepared secret room , with crystal windows, for m which one could see the preced ing cham ber, the spouse of the King and the nak ed Virgin. Solom on prayed him to choose the one of the tw o wom en who pleased him , assuring him that he loved them equally. Among the prin cesses of the court w ho attended the m eeting was a very old wom an in all her finery, dressed in gray, wearing a black fur hat decorated with pearls and red silk, enveloped in a coat em broidered in Turkish style, advanced towards our hero and affir med that she was the m other of the naked Virgin, ad juring him to choose her for his spouse. She adds: “I will giv e you a fusi ble salt to clean her clot hes, an in com bustible oil and an inestim able treasu re”. So Solom on gave him this Virg in, as he asked ; there was th en a tum ult in the King ’s retinue and the dream er slept till morning. On waking, he only saw the st ained clothes of his fiancée on his bed ; he p reserv ed them carefully fo r five years, desp ite the bad sm ell th ey gave off. At the end of this tim e, not knowing what us e they could serve, he thought about taking them apart. Then the o ld lady appeared in all her finery, w ho reproached him bitterly for his negligence; beneath these vestm ents, in fact, wh ich he had neither washed nor put away, were hidden treasures. She then explained that the di sgust he had m anifested, at the tim e of his marriage, for the stained vestm ents of his fiancée at the tim e of his m arriage, had irritated Satu rn her grandfather, who had return ed her to the s tate she was in before being born. Then she revea led to him the m eans of washing this ling erie and re tur ning it to its origina l sta te. Thus the dream er found the universal treasure. *** SECRET SIGNS OF AN ADEPT 1.

This sphere of the div ine sun em its the Li ght of Grace, who se Fiat p roduces Tim e and Space.

Philosophical Sulfur pro ceeds o ut of putrefaction; it is soul. Salt proceeds ou t of calcination; it is form. Mercury, the ch ild, arises out of conjunction; when one coagulates it, one obtains the fixed Archée and the Tincture.

He desired to be personified by the m ystery of the voice am ong visible m en, in such a way that those who were unable to penetrate th e divine m ysteries thro ugh contem plation would be led to the sublim e by visible exam ples. “For it is no t th e sam e for those who are spiritual and thos e who are carnal. The eyes of spiritual people are open to divine things. But for this the seven gif ts of the Holy Spirit ar e necessa ry; g ifts which th e Spirit whic h is G od distributes to each as it pleases Him . “When the Spirit was poured out into the hear ts o f the f aithf ul at Pente cost, it inf used them . “And so it is insufflation whereas the Son is incarnation, and it is not through the exam ple of visible things that it m akes things better, but through the insu fflation of its gifts.” ( Apocalypsis ). THE SUBSTANCE OF LOVE OF THE SPIRIT “For all those who wish to have knowledge of Love, which is the beginning and end of all virtues and all effort, they have only to see wh at is hate. For hate is the m ost odious of all things, and which can never be pardoned. Thus, if m an considers nothing more detestable tha n hate, he is then of God, who never m anifests Hi mself com pletely except by Love. I say to you, if a fa mily m ember, even your brother, presents a di fficult character in his re lations with you, but if you know, however, that he loves you from the bo ttom of his heart, you w ill endure his acrim ony with a certain indulgence. If, on the contrary, yo u know that he hates you, from som e cares, som e caress es with which he surrounds y ou, you will be unable to bear his p resence. It is certain that hatred is the worst iniquity, it is like the abyss of Charybdis, a m onstrous things that envelops, stifles and kills. For one can only live through the Spirit, which is Love in substance. “There is no sin greater than hate. P eople have said to m e that th ere are others. Not so; and as for me, I say that those who seek to beco me adepts of Truth m ust first hear the truth. “For it is certain that th ere is no rem ission for he who sins against the Spirit, not now nor ever, for the Spirit is the Love of God, and he w ho has not the Spirit has not Love. Now, Love is attracted to Love. W here there is hate, the Sp irit is not, that is to say, ther e, there is only death.” ( Apocalypsis Nova ). 71"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" THE FATHER IS STRENGTH -- THE SON, WISDOM -- THE S PIRIT, LOVE “Without L ove, religion is but an external appearance.

On can say that W isdom and Love are two ine stim able po ssession s. However of the two, Love is th e highest, because it is the em anation of the Holy Spirit. “So W isdom proceeded from Strength, for Stre ngth insp ires fear which gives rise to Wisdom ; then W isdom has an end which is Love. The age of the Father is that of Power, the origin of fear; th e age of the Son is that of Sa pience, and that of the Spirit sh all be revea led through Love. “In olden tim es, the Jewish people had no knowledge of God except through his power which inspired fear; He was adored in fear. Th is was only a part of God. Nowadays, through the Son, Christians know S apience. But only those will tru ly an d com pletely know God, who shall know His Love by knowing the Holy Spirit. This lig ht will only shine forth m ost clearly in th e third age” ( Psalter ion Decacord ). *** According to Fludd, God is this pure and catho lic unity W ho contains all m ultiplicity and Who, before Creation, should be cons idered to be a transcendent Being, living within Him self, having a lif e withou t lim it, in W hom all thin gs which m ust be com e explicit a re im plicitly contained. The universe was form ed by Him on the m odel of an archetypal world preexis ting in the divine idea, and exteriorized in a threefold m anner. The eterna l W orld, without leaving its own centr al dep ths, possesse s three d imensions : the point, th e sq uare and th e cube. Unity m ultiplied by itse lf gives squared unity; and this squar e multipli ed b y unity give s the cube, that is to say , another unity. Such is the im age following which th e created world com es out of i ts first source, and retu rns there. The W ord of God is threefold. Firs tly it is the Lord Jesus Ch rist, our Savior ; then it is that by which God created the world and through wh ich He preserv es a ll things ; finally it is the word of the Law, whic h instructs m en and rais es them up to the eternal Kingdom.

For the Rose-Croix, the enigm a of the world was only the perpetual descent of the Word into flesh and the regeneration of flesh through the Spirit; the Abyss becom es Light through the action of mercy; God is realized in Man th rough the Messiah. This com ing forth, to use the language of Boehm e, it eff ected from all eternity. According to the Rose-Croix, the divine plane is filled with the trip le ess ence of Jehovah, the Holy Spirit and Jesus. For the school of the 17 th Century , this terna ry was r esolved in to th e quaternary by Mary, and into the quinary when this Mary descends in to the m icrocosm where she takes the nam e of Sophia. So the divine essence w hich, throughout all Et ernity, is composed of God the Person, the Word Personified and the W ord, is m anifested in Tim e as the Fa the r, Son and Spirit, and becom es visible in our world under the form of Christ Jesus, God and m an.. Such as the two Paradise s, c eles tial and terres trial ( Madathanus ). The triune God, or Jehovah, crea ted all things from nothing, in the Chaos, through the action of the Spirit. T he prim al Hyle of the Sages is ex tracted from it; there are found the firm am ent, the anim als, the m inerals, th e vegetab les, the m acr ocosm whose cente r is the Quintessen ce; th e microcos m, that m ost perfect of creatures; m an, the im age of God, with hi s immortal soul which is a celestial and invisible fire. This hum an creat ure fell; but the Messiah cam e, light of grace and nature; thus, we should take note of the Great Bo ok of Nature by beginning with the O mega, or star of the night, then by m editating on the virtue s of the crucif ied Rose; th en in keep ing silen t about the Alpha, the result – through m editations – of the fertile sun 64 ( Madathanus ). There are th ree adm irable things: God and Man, the Mother and the Virgin, the Trinity and the Unity; just as there are three f undam ental colors: yellow, blue and red ( Madathanus ). The Virgin, the Church and the S oul are the three spouses of the W ord, in Heaven, on Earth and in Man. It is th is trip le spec ification of th e E ssential Na ture th at the Kabbalis ts called th e Shekinah, or the Divine Splendor; and they repres ented the S hekinah under the form of a rose.

Only those with a pure heart shall see God, when they sh all arrive at perfection. On th is earth He deigns to reveal Him self som etim es to the just du rin g sleep. One can imm ediately see that there are tw o opposing elem ents to this phenom enon which is the redemption of m en: one, Grace, com es from on high; the other, Merit, com es from below, from ourselves. W hen the W ord helps us by m eans of the form er, it appear s as the Son of God; when it desc ends to our level to a cquire the latter, it appea rs as th e Savio r.

Now we see how the living action of the Savior on the world can be broken down. We are spectators and actors in a moral battle between the powers of good and the powers of evil, which will end in the trium ph of Good or the trium ph of Evil. A m omentary success of Evil over Good produces the Martyr; a nd on the contrary, a victory of Good over Evil is not won without the conqueror suffering a Passi on. In both cases the result is suffering for man; in the first, in a m aterial way; in the second, in a divine way.

Creation was divided into the Em pyrean, Etheric and Elem entary regions, inhabited by invisible and innum erable nations; the Light spread and was absorbed in the obs cure cinde rs constituting the third world. Ther e are thr ee ascendan t hierarchies of angels: the Teraphim, Seraphi m and Cherubim ; opposing them , three som ber hierarchies populated by fallen angels. The elem enta ry world is the rind, the residue, the ashes, the sedim ent of the etheric fire. Man is a Micr ocosm . All bodies, like so many prisons, enclose a parcel of etheric spirit, an inner m agnetism , whic h is their life. Thus all m inerals have som e vegetative power; all plants have a rudim entar y sensitivity ; all anim als an alm ost reasonable instinct. And so the alchem ist e volves the body with m aterial fire , the magician operates through an invisible fire, and the adept dissipate error through the m eans of intellectual fire. Fludd taught that light is the agen t of universal life. It is the cause of all energies and the mediator or, rather, the m inister of divine will. It is in the ce nter of the world, in consequence behind the sun for our zodiac; it is as more dyna mic as it is more invisible.

On the other hand, the existence of Hell is objective, and those whom the Christ has rebaptized can see it; in the cosm ological developm ent, it comes from the Shadows. There are th ree types of shadow: in Hell, in the extern al skies and on the earth. The firs t two are the most profound. Moreov er, each creature con tain s shadows, whose degree constitutes his own opacity or translucidness; the eye of m an itself is dark, a nd the obscurity which covers it only dissipates in proporti on to his m oral purification. One m ust, moreover, m ention the thaum aturgical shadows produced outside of the ordinary co urse of thin gs and which are signs of a particular will of God.

Nature is a created spirit, tem poral, finished and corporeal; an im age, a shadow of the Eternal. The eye of God sees, created and preserves all things. The regard of this eye is the Light of grace which is the Ergon, the celestial Eve, the silver of regeneration . The circu mference of this light is the celestial tinctu re, the sacram ent par excellence , the Rose-Croix. The eye of Nature sees and reigns over all the earth. Its light lives, dies, works, is corrupted and is reborn anew; it is the Pare rgon, the terrestrial Eve, m aterial birth.

The Fama Remissa (60) of 1616, after protesting agai nst the opinion of those who held that the Rose-Croix were an invention of the Je suits, explained at length that they offered their services in m aking religion, policy, health, so ciety, nature and language act in harmony with God, Heaven and Earth. Die Löblich e Brudersch afft zum Lic htt Schiff , a translation purported to be of a La tin manuscript of 1489, describes an ideal so cial state where ev eryone does his duty. But nobody elucidated the m ystico-philosophical attachm ents of these generous dreams better than Robert Fludd.

Thus, through his own passage, during which the body of the Christ rose up, the Spirit raised and purified the bodies of num erous saints. One shoul d not doubt that the cadav er of any m an placed in the prese nce of the living power of the Spir it could be revived otherwise, during the tim e which separ ates th e resu rrec tion of the Christ an d His com ing again, tha t is to say un til the day when He will m ake all the dead aris e through th e shin ing lig ht of His face, before the Universe, and that He shall tran sfigure the living and purge them of all stain. “All those who are dead in the Christ shall be born again in the Spirit.

In the m argin of a Rosicrucian hieroglyph one finds the device: Jesus m ihi om nia, which also figures in the title of a well-known work by Andreae (36) . It is Jesus who, through the sym bol of the sun, announces perfection. The Rose-Croix re lated them selves to these pr ecepts of Tris megistus: “Man is a great m iracle which one should honor and adore, for he passes into divine nature and him self is a quasi-God. “It is said that the nature of m en is c onsanguineous with the nature of the gods and that this is apparent through divinity. “One should understand the Rosicrucian hier oglyphs and not see th ere the work of a vulgar seeker after gold.”(61) And also: “To him who possesses the W ord uttered alone , and united with the Spirit shining with the divine splendor belonging to the destiny of Moses or Elijah. “It is an effort which wit hout doubt the m en of this cen tury are incapable, sinners prostrate beneath the huge m ass of their faults and who, rather than calling it, driven by a diabolic rage, chase away the Spirit w ith the stick of ignorance and blasphem y. We court death by the error of our life and we win perdition thr ough the works of our hands. For God did not create death and He doesn’ t rejoice in the perd ition of m en. He created man to be immortal; it is the jealousy of the devil that has introduced death. “We shall die through injustice, which is the m odality of the devil, who is the Prince of this world, f rom which he has chased away ju stic e; and th is is th e reason which m akes us incapab les o f imm ortality. Being just, we shall be immortal like Justice herself, whose nature is to be forever and without which we could neither regenerate nor revive ourselves. “However, a certain number of men are not exclu de from the benediction; the m ystery of the resurrection dwells in their souls, and there are those w ho have the privilege to be counted am ong the num ber of the sons of G od, for they pe rceive the light which re igns in the world and which the world sees not; they see it, know it and bear witness to it.”   69 Cf.

Rosicrucian texts endlessly repeat th at the only thing necessary in the world, notably the only m eans of success in alch emy, is to abandon onese lf to God and to ta ke up the Cross of Christ 72 . But from this one should not infer that the t echnical instructions co ntained in these texts have no practical value. In one of the early Chapters of this book 73 we ga ve a brief analysis of the Chemical Wedding of Christian R osencreutz , From the alchem ical viewpoint this work touches on two paths, insisting above all on the hum id way. Here is a comm ent ary given on the Chemical Wedding , in 1617, by the Luxem bourgeois alchem ist Radtichs Brotoffer: 1. – “First day (Distillation), - I seem ed to be (m etonym y, the effect for the cause) in a som ber tower (cucurbite), chained to a great num ber of m en (i mpurities ); we were piled up one upon th e other and we m utually m ade our position m ore dolo rous. Af ter so me tim e in this to rtur e, wonderful trum pets were heard; the roof of the tower opened up (alembic); immediately the crowd began to clim b up, jostling and tram pling each other. Appearing above, an old m an with a white beard (recipient) comm anded us to be silent, etc. “Idem (Rectification of su lfur). – Sc arce ly had he sa id th at than the old wo man comm anded the servants to lower the cord seven times ( aqua vehens ) into the towe r a nd to rem ove those who could take hold of it. Many could not seize it becau se of the weight of their chains (adhering im purities) ; som e even had the ir ha nds torn of f (f ailu re of m ercury or spirit). The old wom an took the nam es of all those who had been brought forth, and sh e complained ab out those w ho rem ained (feces attached to the base o f the vase). II. – “On the second day th e Spouses describe the properties of the stone at the first operation and the second. The high m ountain is the first solution; the crowd is guttae duplicis m ercurii ; the earth is the base of the vase. On th e third day, the town re presents th e glass vase ; the v irgin, double m ercury; her brother, sulfur; the old m an is coagulated earth. “Having the m atter is not enough; one m ust know how to se parate the pure from the im pure; the aid of God is necessary for that , for one m ust only take the blood of the red lion, and the gluten of the white eagle, as T heophrastu s says. In these two operations li es the greatest m ystery of the world. It is above all the gluten whic h is hard to find; it is but a sal t; but this salt is of no use if it s spirit has b een taken o ut. This vital spirit is the root of all ar t. I t is this spirit of which the Wedding speaks, on the seventh da y (the standard-bearers).   72 “The one a nd onl y subject of m agic as wel l as th e tru e Kabb ale, is no thing else th an Wis dom , the Wo rd , the Christ .

This is what Theop hrastus calls unitas per d ualita tem in trinitate. IV. – “Here begins the pu trefaction, when the color black app ears as proof of the correctness of the preceding operations. It is the wh ite g luten of the eag le tha t must blacken. This is explained in the third day of the Wedding , in the passage about the chaining of the emperors, and, in the fourth day, concerning the dead kings. Sweat is the second dissol ution ; the seven vessels, a subtle ear th. V. – “Here the artist m ust pray with fervor an d apply him self to his studies; so that he m ight carefully play his vessel ; that he m ight know how to provoke the flood of the W ise, to drown all that is f eminine.

I pray you do not wake m y friend, nor d isturb her, u ntil she wakes herself” (Song II, 6-7). VI. – “Ferm entation is sym boli zed in the sixth day of the Wedding by a bird who feeds itself with its ow n blood and that of a ro yal person. The stone is m ultiplied by fer mentation. W hite fer mentation is m oon; re d fer mentation is sun; me rcury, as it is the only key of the metals, does not have the power to extinguish itself before having itself been extinguished by sun and m oon; for spirit cannot act upon spir it, nor body upon body. This belongs to the seventh day of the Wedding . VII. – “If one throws the tincture upon an im pur e m etal, the proj ection is lacking. The Wedding describes this as the king and queens gam e, like that of chess. ” One should note that the Rosicrucians authors w ho published ancient m anuscripts never forget to recomm end to the practitioner, before any im portant operations, to pray and to invoke God. *** We will complete the preced ing with extra cts from a very rare Ro sicruc ian piece whose sym bolism is alchem ical 74 .   74 An abstract a rising from his strong inte rest rega rdi ng the techni que of th e pare rgon, this piece is particula rly characteristic of th e dispo sition requ ired to ho pe to participate in th e outerm ost wo rks of the tru e Ro se-Cro ix.

If one does not take these precau tions, he should ab solutely not undertak e th is route. “So, I also undertook this journey, but without reflecting on all the circum stances related above. I later recognized that in setting out on this journey again m any tim es, I learned above all how stupid it is to undertake the purpose without reflecting on it and w eighing the goal. But I never tired of doing it and, on the contrary, m y spir it burned more and more, and it seem ed to me I walked on em eralds, sapphires, jacinths, diam onds and rubies rather than on squalid earth. But many have been fooled by that, the rude ness of the path being unknown to them . “Moreover, the bottom of this place changed co lor accord ing to circum stance, tim e and the shining of the sun, which m ade m e m arvel gr eatly and excited m y de sire still more. And, since it was winter and the dom inant planet stro ngly m anifested it action by the cold, I still found pretty prairies here and there, verdant dom ains and flowers of vari ed colors; but I only thought of the delights of the place toward which the repellant road led, above all because this journey had been begun in honor of Al mighty God and for the good of m ankind. “As I in no way ignored what I m ust do or re nounce entirely the contemplation of this place of delights, or bear with great patience all the difficulties which I should encounter on m y way, I decided to suffer instead, wi th the aid of God, all the hardsh ip that I had given up; for it was im possible to m oderate m y spirit which was inflam ed and full of desire; above all because this road seem ed at first to be very beautiful and agreeable, like a m irror, and m ostly covered with blue flowers called heliotropes or sol sequium ; I think, however, th at this p lace must be full of blood, because the Greeks waged a great com bat against the Troj ans there, as the inhabitants of this country taught m e. “I noted m oreover that such undulating prairies and these varied flowers appeared m ostly when the sun was m asked by opaque clouds, so th at it could not give out its brightness with sufficient power, but when the sun shone fort h without hindrance, th e sun became black like carbon or gleam ing pitch, which almost blinded m e.

I had learned that seven W ise Men or Philosophe rs should live in seven different capitals of Europe, and that these Sages, m ore than all the oth ers, were ins truc ted in a ll the ar ts a nd all wisdom , and in particular, in m edicine. As all m en possess the na tural desire to live for a long tim e and in good health on this earth, I also conceived a great desire to visit a ll these pla ces, to see these Sages, in the hope of also obtaining from one of these Sages a perfect m edicine for the preservation of m y health during the term predestine d by God. So I deliberated which town I should go to first, since it depended on luck whether one of these Sages w ould or even could satisfy me. Also I had learn ed m any tim es, to my cost, that words are vain if prosperity and God’s benediction are lacking; so I easily presum ed th at, although these seven Sages had b een praised as the wisest in all the ar ts in the whole world, intelligenc e is not the sam e for all, but different for each, since God constantly endows one m an with more intelligence, virtue and wi sdom than another, so that one m ay surpass another m uch in quality and attr ibutes. So I thought that it m ust be the same with these S ages. Thus, I prayed fervently to Alm ighty God to lead m e upon the real path to the true m an who surpassed all other with his wisdom, that he m ight look favorably upon m y desire and grant m y request. “Now, during the night I had a dream or a visi on which said to m e in a loud voice: Lead your footsteps toward the pole calle d the Pole S tar observ ed by sailors: it is there that your wish will be g ranted. “When I woke up from the somber night, I m editated over wh ether I should give credence to this d ream or not. F inally I reached a decision, p enetrated by desire in m ind to en ter into this good journey, to undertake the voyage ; and, as it was doubtless a good angel who had shown m e the way in the dream , I set out, by the g race of God. “But as soo n as I wished to go forward, I sa w before m e high, pointed rocks before m e, a hard and co arse road, d eep crevasses, sm oking chasm s where waterfalls produced s uch a noise that I was terrified; and I st opped suddenly in the terror whic h had a hold of m e, and asked myself if I dared go on or whether I should turn back. “On the one hand, the great desire ex cited m e to reach what I had seen before m e; on the other hand, the terrifying aspect of the rude place repelled me, a nd in tru th, I was f earful to se e before m e such a difficult road. So I rem ained in great pain, seeing no m an nearby who coul d counsel m e or console m e in this alternative. 90"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"“Finding myself without aid or consolation, I took m y courage in both hands, m ainly by recalling m y dream , and I set off in the grace of God with a joyf ul step, while being obliged to rest frequently before I com pleted th e clim b.

But in truth, in th e conversatio n, I found much that was right and skilled in h im, that I wouldn’t have believed it and a thousand others w ould not have believed it without having heard it.

HERMETIC AXIOMS 76 . 1.- All th at o ne m ay accomplish by a sim ple m ethod should n ot be tried b y a com plicated one. There is but one Truth whose existence had no n eed for proof, for it is itself its own proof for those who are able to perceive it. Why use comple xity to seek tha t which is s imple? The wis e men say: “Ignis et Azoth tibi sufficiunt.” The body is already in your possession. All you that is required is fire and air. 2.- No substance can be rendere d perfect without long suffering. Great is the error of those who i magine that th e Philosopher’s Stone can be hardened without previous ly b eing disso lved; the ir time and tr avail is los t. 3.- Nature m ust be assisted by art ev ery tim e it lacks power. Art can serve nature, but it cannot supplant it. Art without nature is always anti-natural. Nature without art is not always perfect. 4.- Nature can only be improved through itself. The natu re of a tree ca nnot be changed by the arrangem ent of the bran ches, nor by the addition of ornam ents; it can only be im proved through improvem ent of th e soil in which it grows, or by grafting. 5.- Nature uses nature, understand it and conquers it. There is no other understanding than the unders tanding of oneself. Any being can only truly realize its o wn existenc e, and not th at of an ele ment which it to tally f oreign to it. 6.- He who doesn’t understand m ovem ent does not understand nature. Nature is the product of move ment. The m oment etern al m ovem ent ceases, all n ature ceases to exist. He who does not understa nd the m ove ments produced in his body is a stranger in his own hom e.   76 Extract from La vérit able Alch imie d es Ro se-Cro ix, petit tra ité con tenu dans le gran d a lbum de Mad athanu s , translated by Jean Tab ris (1 89 7). 93"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"7.- All which is produced by an effe ct sim ilar to that produced by a compound element is also a com pound.

Jesus Christ gav e it to His d isciples. Very few m en have rece ived this div ine g ift; f or tha t one m ust becom e the enem y of th e world ; those who th e w orld hates are loved of G od. “There is no wise m an,” said Tertullian, “t hat the world does not take for mad; for the wisdom of this world is the opposite of Heaven’s and, to find the latter, one m ust renounce all the earthly wisdom that one has acquired.” This is because, acco rding to Luke (XVI, 15), all that is great in the world is but nothing in the eyes of God. Thus wisdom is to be found in the house of the hum ble, as Solom on said 80 . Hum ility lights the lam ps of understand ing, as does sincerity an d rectitude. Purification of the heart is th e necessary p reparation to receive wisdom ; but one must seek the active life before the contemplative lif e. W isdom distributes its gifts acco rding to th e man; it gives speech, knowledge or faith ; it de liv ers up the k ey to hidden things, pas t or f uture; it confers kno wledge of all things on the earth and in th e h eavens; it teaches how to read th e thoughts of m an, to spea k all tongues. It is the tree of life, it shows the way to the realm of God. It confers th e power to g ive hea lth, to work m iracles ; it is th e spirit of grace and p rayer; it g ives knowledge of inner m an and of God. The Lor d in structs the wise m an directly in nocturnal dream s and through visions; angels som etimes app ears to him. The contem plative is som etim es riven in ecstasy, he sees the heavens open. The author of this little trea tise give s witness to the gre at favors with which W isdom has filled h im. God shows him first the true road w ith its three degrees, wh ich Jesus had taught to His disciples; then the true m anner of praying and the m anner of distinguishing God’s enem ies from His friends. After receiving th e second degr ee of W isdom , he received an art of inquiring, after a cer tain prepara tio n, into f uture things co ncerning temporal events. In the same degree he received su btle in terp retations of the Scriptu res; the firs t method consis ts of writin g or giving num erous com binations of a sacred word or sign; the second teaches how to find seven senses in the sam e sentence. These two m ethods surpas s in ingeniousness and profoundness all written by Trithem ius and Porta on the subject. He discovered the root of all languages and to this end constructed a speculum archetypum which gave the m eaning of all words im aginable; then the key to all m usical system s. In the sam e way, he found the reasons why one finds on earth so   80 Proverbs XI , 2. 101"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"great a number of different types of m en, and for this re search he constructe d another archetype. He had visions like Ezekiel and the apostle John ; he learned to speak and write new languages. The third degree of Wisdom revealed to h im the thin gs which a re abov e h uman understand ing: the secrets of inner man, the soul, of its birth, of the place it inhab its in incarnated man, about the death an d awakenin g of the soul, what will be the new body of our regeneration . The m ystery of the Trinity was unveiled to him w ith its correspondences, as was the nature and constitution of spirits. H e knew the hidden m ystery of m arriage, that of the f all and those which sym bolize baptism , communion, those of the co mmunion of saints and the Holy Spirit. Moreover, God revealed to him many things about the third worl d, the second com ing of Christ , the day of the Lord, th e m illenniu m of the Apocalypse , the resurrection of the dead, the last judgm ent, the disappearance of the visible unive rse and its renovation, a bout the two persons who will com e bef ore this day, on the new Jer usalem , its construc tion , its re lig ion , on a new understanding of the Sc riptures, a new Holy Bo ok, on the Gospel of the New Cove nant, on the new sacrifice, the new law, the new social s tate, a m edicine, a philosoph y, a new m agic, finally about life eternal, the one religion and the one kingdom . The author also received the mystic al in tellig ence of the Sc riptu res and the r evela tio n of their anagogical sense. He consigned som e of the secrets of th e second degree in two manuscripts on m ystic T heology and on the new reign of Christ on earth. To end, our m ystic retu rns to the constant opp osition to th e precepts o f divine W isdom and those of hum an wis dom . He develops the la ws of the form er, while citing in profusion the sacred texts on poverty, charity, on trials, on hum ilit y. He ends by adjuring his read ers not to pu t their faith in the shadows of hum an wisdom , but in the power of the Light, for the splendor which com es from God will neve r b e extingu ish ed (W isdom VII, 14). One m ight say tha t th e esta te of the Rose-C roix unites the extrem es of stability and movem ent, like th e Holy Spirit, whic h reunites th e extr em es of the Fathe r, ete rnal sta bility, and the Son, infinite vital movem ent. They express th is by saying that their place of reunion is the Tem ple of the Holy Spirit, and th at there they receive the two sacram ents of the prim itive and eternal Church: one of the baptism s of the Spirit m entioned by the Gospel, and a plenary communion with the W ord. Fludd expresses the same ideas in different ways in his Sum mun Bonum . (19) “Christ was born in Bethlehem ; now, Bethlehe m gives us the ‘house of bread’ and the ‘house of war’, that is to sa y the sam e thing as Beth-El. “The wise m en of the Rose-Croix and their spiritual dwelling place are am ply described by the apostle St. Peter.

Thus all things subm it to them , because their w ill is iden tical to the La w.” (63) We com e, as we see, in the starry abysses of the m ystical, or to the he ight of its most vertiginous summits. This is how they can live there. Ruysbroeck the Adm irable described, with a ra re truth of expression, the higher states of spiritua l lif e 81 . These are the degrees about which he sp eaks in the following pages, w hich we are borrowing from the lovely translation by Ernest Hello. Although we are far from the occult knowledge which the vulgar believe to be the unique privilege of the Rose-Croix, w e quote here an orthodox seer to show the paths le ading to the sam e and unique Light. SECRET FRIENDS AND MYSTERIOUS CHILDREN. “There is an inner and unknown difference be tween the secret friends of God and his mysterious children. Both have rights in His pres ence. But th e friends po ssess th eir v irtu es, even the innerm ost ones, with a cert ain property, im perfect in its nature.

Although they f eel the divine union between the effusion of their l ove, nevertheless they have the im pression in the foundation of them selves, of an obstacle and a distance. They ha ve neither notion, nor love of si mple transport; nakedness, being ignorant of its m anner of being, is a stranger to them .

They know and distinguish intellectual powers well enough; but sim ple cont emplation, learning on Di vine Light, is unknown to them .

Re solved to serve God and to love Him forever, they yet do not have desire for the sublim e dea th, which is the d eiform lif e. They atta ch little im portance to external works and this m ysterious peace which resides in activ ity. Th ey reserve all the ir liv e for the inne r conso latio ns and for imperfect sw eetness ; this is why they stop on th e path, and rest before the m ysterious death a nd lo se the crown which naked Love places upon the head of the conqueror. “They enjoy a certain divine union; they pract ice, they im prove th eir m inds, they know their state distinctly, in their inner ways they love the paths which rise up. But they ignore the sublim e ignorance of transport which they do not know, and the m agnificence of this vagrancy enclosed in superessential love, fr eed from beginning, end and m easure. “Ah, the dis tance is great indeed between the secret friend and the m ysterious child.

It is absolu tely necessary hold onto the inner love; so we will await with joy the ju dgm ent of God and the c oming of Jesus Christ. “But, in the very exercise of our activity, we die to ourselves and to all property; then, transported above all, by the sublim e excess of th e open, naked spirit, we shall feel within us with certainty the perfection of the children of God, and the sp irit will touch us without an interm ediary, for we are naked.” Moreover, the re integ ration of inca rnated m an into all th e priv ileg es of his pr im itive estate is described in the Apocalypse by the sy mbols of the wedding of the La mb and the new Na me. The curious will find adm irable develop ments of this them e in the works of Gichtel. Her e is the commentary by R uysbroeck, wh ich will s uffice to set down the id eas. THE S MALL S TONE AND THE NEW NAME. “To him that overcom eth”, says the Holy Spirit in the Apocalypse, “shall I give to eat of the hidden m anna; and a white stone, and on that stone a new na me, which none shall know save him that rec eiveth it.” He that overcom eth is he who has crossed and gone beyond him self and all things. The hidden m anna is inner emotion, ce lestial joy. The pebble is a sm all stone, so sm all that one m ay tram ple it underfoot without pain ( calculus , pebble; from calcare , tread).The stone is white and brillian t lik e a round fla me, infinitely s mall, pol ished on all faces, aston ishingly sm ooth. One of the senses presented by this stone could be the sym bol of J esus Christ. Jesus is the candor of light eternal; He is th e splendor of the Father; He is the untarnished m irror, in w hom lives all living things. This white stone is given to the transcendent conqueror, bringing w ith it life, magnificence and tru th. This stone resem bles a flam e. The Love of the Eternal W ord is a love of fire; this f ire has f illed the world, and it wan ts a ll spir its to burn with in it. It is so sm all, this 104"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"stone, that one can tread it underf oot without feeling it. The Son of God justified the etym ology of the word calculus. Obedient unto death and unt o the death on the cross, He was dest royed. No longer m an, but worm of the earth, disgrace of hum ankind and m isjudged by the populace, H e was put under the feet of the Jews, who tram pled Hi m without feeling Him.

Th is m agnificent sm all stone is perfectly rounded on all sides. Th e rounded form , the form of the sphere recalls eternal truth, without beginning or en d. This equality of aspect which pres ents the sph erical form on all sid es indicated ju stice which weighs all with equ ity, re ndering to each that which is h is du e. To whom this s tone is given, each will keep it forever. This pebble is extrao rdin arily ligh t. The etern al Word weighs nothing; it supports heaven and eart h th rough its virtue. It is personal to each, and is seized by no one. J esus is the oldest of cr eatures, and His excellence surpas ses all; He manifests Him self to an yone as He wills, wher ever He go es, borne by His imm ense lightnes s; our hum anity is shown over all the heavens and is seated at the righ t han d of the Fath er. “The white stone is given to the owner; it bears the new nam e, which he alone knows who receives it. “All the spirits which return to God receive th eir own nam e. The nam e depends on the more or less excellent dignity of their virtues, and the height of their love. “Our first nam e, that of our innocen ce, that wh ich we receiv e at baptism, is adorned with the m erits of Jesus Christ. If we return to gr ace, after losing o ur baptism al innocence, we receive a new nam e from the Holy Spirit, an d this shall be an eternal nam e.” Let us summ arize by explaining that these wo rds of truth close with dignity a book which is but the humble echo of the m ost mysterious words of our Occident. Divested of all their initiato ry logosophy, the concepts which we have just presented are substantia lly in a little bo ok which ha d f allen into oblivion and from the pen of a m ystic to whom we can attribute a Rosicrucian affiliation: the c ounselor of Eckhartshausen. We wish to conclude by summ arizing The Cloud Upon t he Sanctuary , indica ting there, if we wish to arrive at the summits its describ es, th e counsels o f a work entitled Some features of the inner Church , by Ivan Lopoukhine, which, to satisfy the needs of the soul, recalls the Imitation de Jesus Christ. “This inner Church truly exists on a certain plan e in the Inv isible, from the creation of the world and will perp etu ate itself until the end of tim e. It is the Holy Spirit Itse lf which instructs the m embers, and W ho presents th em with the trut h in all parts of nature. The m embers of this Church live on earth. Its purpose is to prepare for the reig n of God; it is through its influence, through its collaboration, of with its aid, that all light has descended upon the earth, germ inated there and bo rn fruit. It is hierarchical, both in its constitu tion and in its initiation. “The first degree, the lowest, consists of the m oral good by which sim ple will, subordinated to God, is conducted. The m eans by wh ich the spirit of this school is served are called inspirations. 105"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"“The second degree consists of intellect ual reason, by which the understanding of the man of good will, who is unite d with God, is crowned with wisdom and the ligh t of understanding: the m eans by which the spirit is served are called inner illum inations. “Finally th e third deg ree, and the most el evated, is the entire opening of our inner sensorium , by which the inner m an com es to the obj ective vision of m etaphysical and real truths. “This is the m ost elevated degree in whic h faith passes in a vi sion, and the m eans by which the sp irit is s erved to ensu re that these are true visions. “These are the three deg rees of th e true sc hool of inner wisdom , of the inner comm unity of the light. The sa me spirit which develops m en for this community also distribu tes its degree s through the coaction of the person being developed. “This inner school com municates, accord ing to circum stan ces, with ou r schools which receive them according to their cap ability; its m embers are never bro ught togeth er not united in body, unless necessary. God is their Chief and He is equally obeyed by all, whatev er the work assigned to them . Entry into this school is inside our selves but one can on ly find the door when one is read y, that is to say when one has und erstood the true basis o f hum ility, the death of egotism and a confidence in the goodness of the Father.” (55) We don’t think we can end this im perfect study with a truer e xpression of feeling. To that end, we ask that this bo ok will at least s erve to lead som e of those who walk in the ways of Knowledge to the narrow doorway: that they verify all things with the prude nce of a serpent, for many schools have falsely taken the nam e and mantle of the true Rose-Croix. 106"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIV : HOW TO BECOME INITIA TABLE TO THE FRA TERNITY OF THE ROSE-CROIX Hum an science and knowledge is com pletely usele ss to bring us to the ideal set forth by the Rose-Croix: sanctity.

To the extent that he purifies him self, Nature unveils itself to him , wit hout the interm ediary of books; and he can stop and unders tand its secrets (Alchem y). 4.

Here one will only find train ing appropriate to m ake the seeker capable of feeling and understand ing the lessons of this final school. This training can the divided into three periods : regaining oneself, behavi or towards ones peers, and inner culture. A. – First of all, you should be aware of the superhum an e xcellence of the kind of perfection which is offered to us by the life, actions and wo rds of Our Lord Jesus Christ. Study them as they encom pass all that it is possib le fo r m an to kn ow; know that practice is m ore efficacious tha n theory ; roo t out the pass ionate l ove of visible things; realize that th ey are but the im perfect s igns of perfect Beauty. Shun reputation; see good in ot hers and, in yourself, the bad. No progress is possible without sincere hum ility. Realize that all of hum an science and philosophy is partial, provisional and fleeting. If you come to hear with in you th e v oice of the Word, you w ill know truth and you will live in the etern al. For that, it is enough to arrive at knowledge of your self, that is to say, to discern if the strong im pulses which m ake us act and thing com e from egotism or from Heaven; to him who abdicates his own will God gives true knowledge. However, weigh all things, both without and with in. Help yourself and Heaven will help you. Read and lis ten sim ply and hum bly. Covet nothing with virulence; you will com e to lose peace and do evil; only God m ay be desired with th e m ost blazing and tenacious ardor; one should always rem ember that H eaven is never where we be lieve it to be; above all it rests with him who deem s hi mself the least and the last. B. – So should you serve everybody ; but expect no recognition; he who would lay down his life for his f riend is only doing his d uty. Seek not socie ty, f amiliarity, position ; re main where Destiny, th at is to say God, has put you; Heav en will find you as eas ily in a work shop as in a palace, in Paris as in th e Hi malayas . Only speak to give words of advice or encouragem ent. Do not concern yourself in the tem por al, with what is expected of your station. Do battle against your faults every inch of the way, as a house is b uilt b rick by brick ; striv e never to give ground. Rejoice in trials, m iserie s and tem ptations ; in each Heaven is offering you the m eans of m aking great progress. Never shirk effort, even of the m eanest kind, even if it seem s pointless.

Keep watch lest spiritual pride or egotism rise up in you. Nourish fraternal love; support others in all their troubles ; understand that all m en are, in reality, but a single being. C. – Never give in to the self, even in the sm allest things. Learn about the works of the servants of God, in past cen turies; have fire in you; exam ine yourself each m orning and even ing, before praying; but during the day, wo rk without cease except when called to Christ, when it is required.

No one is lost foreve r. *** One will then unders tan d, from that tim e on, th at wi shing to becom e Rose-Croix is an illus ion. Moreover, did not the wisest go to the sourc e from whence f ollows a ll truth and f rom which com es all certainty ? Now, what we can strongly affirm – since the mom ent has com e to explain this – is tha t th e Gospel contains th e whole in itiatio n of the Rose -Croix. Th e Gospel co ntai ns all that sociology, philanthropy, theology has discovere d and will discover in its insp ired pages and, moreover, the code, the rules, the m ethod of some seventy initi ations, and the Rose-Croix is but one of these initiations. The Im itatio n, which the Rose-Croix hold in great veneratio n, proceeds from the Gospel and the genius of God who is c alled Elias Artista is onl y a m inister of Hi m who spoke the Gospel. The best we can do, then, is to live by the Gospel. Besides, we should not let oursel ves be dazzled, and rem ember th at the Master of the Gospel said: “All of you, m y Friends, be ye sure that I shall be with you forever, until the end of the world.” This one s entence con tains m ore than al l powers, more than all m agic, m ore than all adeptsh ips, more than all parad ises. The m ost importan t charge is therefo re to becom e a friend of Christ. Besides, we who are outside cannot judge the in terior of the tem ples nor the gods which are venerated there. This is why we must hold to this one God, fo r Whom our heart is the true tem ple: this is why one must purif y the hear t. This is th e ke y to all san ctuar ies, the password to all m ysteries, the solution to all enigm as. If th e will is evil, the thoughts, words and actions are evil; if they are holy, all becom es sound. Once this immense result is obtain ed, we are worthy of all places and capable of all functions.
