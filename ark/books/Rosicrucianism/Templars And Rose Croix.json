Almost eight years of res earch and cros s-check ing b etween the two principle lineages have allo wed us to m ake a choice. We now present, in these few pages, an attem pt to justify th is choice to a public fascinated by this perpetuation of the prestigious and passionate Militia. If it is possible to go back through the fa mily genealogies of European nobility up to the 15 th Century relatively easily, it becom es harder to investigate the 15 th and 14 th Centuries. And to reach the 13 th and 12 th Centuries one needs to m ake use of earlier works, written under the old regim e, and pres erved by old nobles. And what can we say about the almost insurmountable di fficulties facing historical an alysis, when it is aimed at an Order su ch as the Militia of the Temple of Solomon , where we know that everything was seized and destroyed at the tim e of the suits agains t them ? Also, if there had been a perpetuation of the Order, it was of necessity se cret! So it is hardly surprising that, even if people existed in Europe after the 16 th Century who claim ed the Temple , and even if we could dr aw atten tion to the ro le of Occultism in this af fair at that time, we would be unable to affirm that, after the arrest of the m ajor part of the Order, we could find Knights who quickly constituted a secret societ y, with th e sole aim of perpetu ating both the Order and its Mysterious Aims .

In this study (as a result of seven years of research, exam ination and cross -exam inatio n), we support that of the Templar Strict Observance , issu ing in an in controvertible m anner fro m the Teutonic Order , and here is how. * * * Founded in Riga in 1204 by Albert d’Apel dern, Bishop of Livonia, at the request of two brothers, Engilbert and Thierry of Tiffeneh, nobles of Bre men, to com bat the pagans opposed to the Gospel, and approve d in 1203 by Pope Honorius on the counsels of Dom inic Guz man, the future St. Dom inic, th e Order which firstly interests us bore the nam e of The Order of Knights Arms-Bearers . It was also called Order of Knights of Livonia , Order of Brothers of the Sword , Order of Knights of Two Swords , becaus e its members wore a long white alb over the surcoat, a robe on which wa s e mbroidered two red swords, placed in a St Andrew’s cross, in the center of the chest. Modeled on that of the Temple , the historians studying the Arms-Bearers te ll us, and founded on the counsels of St. Dom inic following a journey to Central Europe, by the Knights fro m the Temple , from its inception it b ore the name of The Order of Brothers of the Militia of Christ ; a n ame close to that of the Te mplars in their ea rliest days ( Militia of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon ). The Order of Arms-Bearers conquered Estonia and part of Livonia (from which it took its secondary name: Knights of Livonia ), and in 1237 m erged into the Order of Teutonic Knights . Here is the direct, hist orical contact between the Temple and the Teutonics . So the Arms-Bearers survived, under the name of Knights of the Cross , in the dependence of the Teutonics until 1526, the year when W alter of Plettenberg repurchased   1 J. H.

In 1561 the fiftieth Provin cial Grand Master of the Arms-Bearers , Golta r Kettler, em braced Lutheran ism , ceded Liv onia to Kin g Sigism und II of Poland, and him self becam e Duke of Courlande. The Order of Arms-Bearers th en ceased to exist under this nam e and m erged with the Teutoni c Or der , although it preserved its own traditions, archives, and only c onstituted a “langue 2 ” within its bosom . The Teutonic Order had been founded during the siege of St. John of Acre in 1112, to we lcom e sick and abandoned Germ an cr usaders in Palestine. The Order was confirm ed by Pope Callistes III in 1192. Its members followed the rule of St. Augustine. They origin ally ca lled them selves “ Teutonic Brothers Hospitaller ”. Little by little they took on a more m ilitary aspect. Knights integ rated with them and organized them more along the lines of the ot hers of this tim e: Knights of St. John of Jerusalem (Malta), Templars, Holy Sepulcher , etc... In the 13 th Century the Teutonic Knight in vaded Prussia and undertook to elim inate th e pagan ba rbarism which liv ed th ere in a latent s tate. The Order was sovereign u ntil 1440. Then a part of this country which was still unkno wn gave itself to Casim ir, King of Poland, and the rest rem ained u nder the authority of the Teutonic Order , which was sovereign there. In 1525, Albert, Grand Master of the Order, and Margrave of Brandenburg, secularized the Teutonic Order . The Knights still wore the g reat white m antle with the cross sab le (black) patée et alesée , nowadays called the “Maltese Cross”. But the Knights Arms-Bearers , which had been incorporated into the Teutonics , nevertheless – as we saw earli er – hadn’t lost the m emory of their o rigins. The h ad rem ained independent within, ev en if they had been abso rbed. The s imilarity of their nam e to that of the fa mous Temple Militia , and the num erous points in comm on of their rules, had allowed them to m aintain intact a f oreign Christian tradition in the spirit of the origin al Teutonic Order . This was Eastern Christian ity, and Byzantine, Copt and Jacobite 3 Liturgies show us how close they we re to original Gnostic Christianity . When, in 1697, the elector of Saxony, Frederic-Augustus I st joined P oland and Saxony, he found himself at the head of an imm ense territory, very diverse in its com ponents: the Duchy of Magdeburg, the Elec torate of Brunswick-Luneburg, the Duchy of Bre men, the Principality of Luneburg-Celle, that of W olfenbüttel and Halberstad t, the Duchies of Mecklendburg and Ho lstein, all the free Hanseatic towns, etc...

It is then th at at the heart of the Teutonic Ord er a “Mason ic regim e” was born, grouping together exclusively Germ an aristocr ats, predom inantly Catholic, as were the gentlem en Freem asons who were loyal to the Stuarts. Note also that the Teutonic Order rem ained an equestrian Catholic Or der ( sixt een quarters of nobility were required to be adm itted, and to prof ess this r eligion. It died tow ards the end of the 19 th Century). On the fact that the Teutonic Order served as a cradle for the Strict Templar Observance of Germany , let us simply quote the letter of Meunier de Précourt, which Alice Joly m entioned in her work: “ A Lyonnais Mystic and the Secrets of F ∴ M ∴ ”. Speaking of Meunier de Précourt his author tells us (p. 11): “ He cites the Teu tonic Knights and the German Rose-Croix as havin g been the Intermediar ies between the Order of the Temple and Freemasonry .” We will see the Teutonic Knights and Ger man Rosicrucian s frequently reappear during the course of this study. And this com ing together is significant... Note also th at the Strict Templar Observance reprised th e Rule of the Tem ple in all its s ever ity, with rega rd to the p roofs of nobility: “ None shall be admitted into the Order without providing proofs of nobility. These proofs consist either in titles of hereditary nobil ity, or of personal nobility.” (General Code of Rules, quoted my Vuillaud in “ The Lyonnais Rose-Croix ”, p. 216). Now, personal nobility is defined as ha ving been ennobled oneself, either by title or letters com ing from a legitim ate Sovere ign, or arising from a knightly dubbing received in som e Order. W hen three successi ve generations, grandfat her, father and son, have thus been ennobled by one of thes e two m ethods, the nobi lity then becom es hereditary. In th e Mid dle Ages, this was ca lled “noblesse à la tierce-foi”, becau se it recognized three successive acts of hom age towa rds a Suzerain or an Order. In France, under the Monarchy, when three generations of officers had each served twenty years, and reached the level of Capt ain, and having each received th e Cross of St. Louis, these three generations transmitted a now hereditary nobility to successive generations. Under the Res toration, Louis XVIII exten ded th is p rivilege to the Legion of Honor and officers serving under the sam e conditions 4 . But all this tends to prov e that the Te mple and its imm ediate successo rs h adn’t the slightest interest in democracy...

It is nothing m ore than a transposition , valid in our age 5 . Moreover, pretend ing th at Freem asonry is the in heritor of th e Temple , under the pretext that it cam e out of the Corporations, and that operative M asons of for mer tim es were “colleagues of the Temple ”, is no m ore serious. These operative Masons, to whom the Knights accorded their though tful protectio n, would ne ver have been considered as equals by the true “Brothers of the Tem ple”. Having never received the chivalric dubbing, the “Com panions” of yesteryear would not have been able to transm it it. The commoner who wished to obtain knighthood could only receive it on the f ield of battle, in recom pense for his valor, and form the hand of a knight. If not, he would have had to com plete the pilgrim age to Jerusalem and receive the colée 6 of the guardian m onks of the Holy Sepulcher, upon the Tomb itself 7 . * * * Let us re turn to the Tem ple. Here is an im portant p oint, of ten passe d over in s ilence. In a work entitled “ History o f the M ilitary Or der of the Holy Sepulcher ”, published in Rom e, without a precise date, under the pontificate of Pius X, and edited by the Rom an He raldic College, Count Pasini Frassoni, Historian of the Order, and assist ed by two senior m embers of the Holy Sepulcher , te lls us the f ollowin g: “In his des cription of the recep tion of Knights of the Holy Sepulcher, Zweller shows us that these knights were considered to be the tru e succ essors of the Templars ...” Hence the jealousy of the Order of Malta, m aterial inheritor of the Temple . Be that as if m ay, one fact is certain, an d that is that Innocent VIII suppress ed the Order of the Holy Sepulcher in 1490. Now, since the taking of Jerusalem by the Turks, the monks and knights of this Order were dispersed throughout Europe, particularly in Poland, above in Michow (near Krakow ), which becam e the seat of the O rder, in S ilesia, Bohe mia and Moravia. These places where the Holy Sepulcher survived (d espite its pontif ica l dissolu tion ) were, in the 16 th and 7 th Centuries, r ightly a ctiv e centers of diffusion of the esoteric doctrines bel ong ing in f act to the Order of the Temple , and, at the end of the 18th Century, active center of th e Tem plar Mason ry called “ Strict Observance ”, issuing from   5 Ov er ti me, th is military k nigh tho od had to beco me a sp iritu al an d philosoph ical lin e, an d becau se of this, there was no longe r any grea ter anac hron ism between th e two, th an th ere i s bet ween a n olden-t ime Kni ght of M alta cr ossing t he M editerranea n in the O rder ’s galleys, and a c ont em pora ry ‘Knight of M alta’ financi ng t he great leprosa ria of Eu rope wi th hi s denari i’s. 6 My d ictio nary isn ’t big enoug h to list th is word – need to ch eck later – PV . 7 Read a bout t hese c ustom s in: “ Ch iva lry ” b y Léon Gaultier (Paris, 183 2), and the su mmary b y Baro n Gue nièb re: “ On Ch iva lry ” (Paris, 1953). 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Tem plars & R ose C roix, T ranslated by Pi ers A Va ughan © 2 005 the Teutonic Order ! Note this fact, f or we will find num erous echoes in the course of this study, when we look in particular at the Germ an Illum inist m ovem ents. Another author, John Char pentier, in his work “ The Order of the Templars ”, quotes a docum ent dated 1745 affir ming that “ the canons of the Holy Sepulcher sheltered the Templar s .” And in fact, in the 18 th Century, the Dukes o f Bouillon having cons titu ted a Protestant branch of this sam e Order of the Holy Sepulcher , and a Masonic obedience (the “ Grand Orient of Bouillon ”), introduced Templar Masonr y and its high grades into it. Finally, in Sweden, Tem plar Masonry ca lled “Reform ed Masonry” (this word does not allude to the religion of this nam e but to Masonic reform ations), included the “ Knights of the Holy Sepulche r of Jerusalem in P alestine ” am ong its high grades. It should be noted that the House of Bouillon had always claim ed to hold the hereditary rights over the Order of the Holy Sepulcher . In 1909, Count Pasini, their historian, tells us that Genera l Math ieu of Fossey, inheritor of the titles of Prince of th e Tour d’Auvergne and the Duke of Bouillon, also inherited, “ what is said to be the title of the Grand Master of the Order of the Holy Sepulcher .” So what was created by the Duke of Bouillon in the 18 th Century, and given a Masonic and laic f orm by hi m, was licit... Thus, with its Templar grades, high aris tocr atic Mason ry possessed grades recalling th e ties of th e Tem ple to that founded by Godefroy of Bouillon... (In our archiv es we have in our hands a copy of a ritual manuscript , dated 1778, and which is that of the “ Knights of the Holy Sepulcher, in the Or ∴ of Toulon .”) In a work presented to the general pub lic, we obviously cannot give extracts of the Ritu als of Reception and Dubbing of th e Templar Strict Observance , as these cerem onies are and shou ld rem ain se cret, in re spect of its sec ular trad itio n. But we can nevertheless affir m that: Certain rites of the last high grades (Tem ple Cl ass) m anifest the influen ce of a purely Balkan esotericism , thus unde rlining the im por tance of this early cradle: Bohem ia and Moravia, and thus com ing from the Eastern Mediterranean. In pa ssing we can quote a fact revealed by Doinel (Cf. Jean Kotska: “ Lucifer unmasked ”), which represented – even evoked – the original founders of the Order of the Temple , with the help of wax candles arrang ed lik e the five cr osses of the Holy Tom b. Certain secret cu stom s, with a sure occult efficiacy, which allow the actualization o f a definitive psychic communion with the passed Mem bers of the Ord er; rites which com e directly fro m the very o ld m edieval com pani onship. If they do not go back all the way to the tim e of t he dispersal of the Order, they can still be scrupulously attested to go back to the 16 th Cen tury, and th at is no t so contem ptible – the m ore so becaus e they im ply the preservation of two ingredients since this ag e, ingredients renewable by reason of new initiations. 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Tem plars & R ose C roix, T ranslated by Pi ers A Va ughan © 2 005 The cerem onies of the Templar Strict Observa nce were (and are still) inf initely more occult and more m ysterious in th eir im plication s, than thos e of the Knights Beneficent of the Holy City , whose ritual is not very different, in f act, to that of the Catholic “ miles Christi ”, drawn up in the 13 th Century. That is to say that the prom oters of the Order of Knight Beneficen t of the Holy City (W illerm oz a nd his Lyonnais friends ) had not only rejected the Tem plar lin eage, but als o the v ery s oul of this lineage. The Convent of Gaul of 1778, held in Lyons, had com pletely burned th e bridges with what had survived of the Tem ple, at the heart of the Teutonic Order , and the “ C.B.C.S. ” were not longer Tem plars ( officia lly , at least, for, in fact...). This line age in all its purity now only exis ts in Sweden and Denmark (two branches : one official, the o ther more hidden as it is com posed of occultis ts ). In Germ any (at lea st b efore the ar riva l of the Hitler plague), the re was still a Templar S trict Observance , also occult. In Russia, we lack (and for good reas on) any docum entation on the situation : but it app ears to hav e been perp etuated am ong cultiv ate d classes u p to around 1900, perhaps even up to the revolution of 1917. In England (and English occultism is very secretive) we know that the Templars exist: but we are ignorant of the com plete story of these associations. At the m ost, in 1947 one could read this curious echo in the edition of the journal “The Liberated Parisian” dated August 29: “Gaining access to the vaults of the Tem plar Church in London, som e unidentified persons m anaged to remove the skull of the first Count of Essex, who was mortally wounded in the head in 1144. More over, the violated four sepulchers and scattered bones.” What were these m ysterious unidentified persons looking for? Not jewels, for the rugged knights, so faithful to their titles of “ Poor Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon ”, had no tradition of being interred with ornam ents. But perhaps these singular profaners w anted to take possession of a ps ych ic “witn ess” which would perm it them to link th e liv ing with the d ead ? Occult trad ition h as such requ irem ents... One has wanted to see this in Baron Charles von Hund, the founder of the Strict Tem plar Observance who, audaciously (the tim e now being propitious 8 ), gave claim to the fact that this Order was its regular cont inuation, which had been kept secret for four hundred years, in order to claim from the Vatican and the Order of Malta th e im mense am ount of property stolen from the original Temple . So it is useful to show, at the start of this study, that there w as but one link in this lineage. In this re gard, here is a docum ent which we believe convincing, which the historian Bord quotes in his book “ Freemasonry in France .”   8 It being a little h arder in th e 18 th Century for the P ope a nd Fre nch m onarc h t o dem and t he im pri sonment of any one claiming t he line! - PV . 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Tem plars & R ose C roix, T ranslated by Pi ers A Va ughan © 2 005 In a letter dated May 28, 1784 from Hanau, Prince Charles of Hesse wrote thus to Willerm oz, to whom he had just co mmunicated the death o f the fa mous Count of Saint- Germ ain, unexpectedly in Feburary 28 th at his hom e in Gottorp: “I asked him: Did you know a certain Marshall of Bieberstain? “Reply: Yes , very well... “– Where did you see him? “– At Varsovia. “– Did he know som ething ? “– Relata refero...

How, in a Order which had shown itself so terrib ly ste eped in the aris tocr atic morgue (in the words of European Masons), had occultists managed to gain adm ission? Montchal tells us that at the Convent of Kohlo in 1742, a firs t purging had already occurred. That is a piece of history of secret societies and chivalric Orders which .... It is very probably by and with the support of the Prin ces of the House of Hesse- Cassel... We know, i n fact, from sure his toric sources, that W illiam IV of Hesse-Cassel, called “ The Wise ”, was an enlightened sovereign, rem arkable for his broad and extended knowledge, above all in the rea lm of occultism . Born on June 14, 1533, died August 25, 1592, he was the author of Astrological Tables , and published the result of his observa tions in this area. He possessed an astronom ical observatory where he worked for m any years with his friends, Christ Rothm ann, the wise Mathem atician, and Just Bo rge, who was the best Physician-Optician of the age. He was also the friend an d constant protector of Tycho de Brahé. Now, from the appearan ce of the heraldry of the House of Hesse-Cassel, we can note a curious fact. According to the ge nealogist La Chesnay des Bois, in his “ Dictionary of Nobility ” (Ed. from 1776), quoting du Bui sson, and according to J. B. Rietstap in his book “General Heraldry”, both fam ous heraldists, the Princes of Hesse- Cassel bor e shie lds: “of silv er with a red La ting cross with broad ends, with a second crossbar in red 11 ...” So the Hou se of Hess e-Cassel bore as th e distinctive family emblem the Latin cross w ith a second red crossba r, w hich was the exclusive priv ilege of the high dignitaries of the O RDER OF THE T EMP LE , of the living Order... For this red cross was its exclusive privilege, and none other a mong the knightly Orders com ing from the Crusades w as given the right to work under the white m antle!   11 “D’ argent à la Cro ix pa tée et a lésée de gueules, à la double tra verse de gueules”. 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Tem plars & R ose C roix, T ranslated by Pi ers A Va ughan © 2 005 This privilege was conceded to the Tem plars by Pope Eugenius III in 1146, at the request of St. Bernard. (Cf. Probst-Biraben, in ” The Mys tery of the Templars ”, p. 29). As for the double cross, it was the m ark of high dignitaries of the Te mple, as John Charpentier tells us in his work “ The Order of the Templars ” (p. 41). But this is n ot all. W e have m entioned Tycho de Brahé, a nd here is a still m ore surprising fa ct! Son of the Grand Bailiff of S canie, belonging to the oldest Swe dish nobility (still Sweden, or rather already Swedish), Tycho de Brahé had a château co nstructed which was devoted to his alchem ical and astrolog ical studies, with a splendid library and observatory, all nam ed Uranienborg.   Born in 1546 in Scanie, Denm ark (which St ate was still a province of Sweden), he died in Prague in 1601. Note this place, for we will retu rn to it as a meeting place for Jewish Kabbalis ts, Alc hem ists and Rosicruc ian Theurgis ts in the ye ars which f ollow, right up to the end of the 18 th Century. Now, one beautiful day in 1590, which disem barked in Uranienborg? King Jam es VI of Scotland, (future King of E ngland under the nam e of Ja mes 1 st ), who had just legally reinstated the Order of C hardon of Saint Andrew of Scotland , which Order was a perpetuation of the Templars, as we have seen... From Uranienborg, the King and Tycho de Brahé went to Cass el, and stay ed near to W illiam IV, the W ise. In 1591, a year later, Jam es VI published a first treatise on pneum atology, in which he treated at length on the diverse nature of Spirits, developing the theories of his predecessor in this domain, Reginald Sc ott, but perh aps also tho se of his f riends: W illia m IV the W sie and Tyc ho de Brahé. This book was “ Daemonologia, hoc est adversus incantationem sive magiam institutio, auctore serenissi mo potentissimioque principe .” This sam e sovereign, with the first English Rosicrucians, constitu ted th e “ Royal Rose Croix ”, com posed of thirty-tw o knights (in rem embrance of the thirty -two Pa ths of Wisdom of the Kabbalah ), and who was certainly the point of departure for the Jacobite Rose-Croix , which becam e the 18 th Degree of Scottish Masonry of the 19 th Century.

We note that certain authors, notably Ph illéas L ebesgue, supporte d the theory that Marshall von Ludendorff had been one of the last representatives of an esoteric Teuronic kernel, perpetuating certain theo ries from the Gi belins to ex clusively pangerm anist ends. What the fam ous devise of the Austrian Emperors cla imed to affirm with their “A.E.I.O.U.”, when translated from Latin into English s ignif ied so mething lik e this : “Austria is d estin ed to do minate the world”. And it was Ludendorff who made Hitler ! But let u s re turn to the Strict Templa r Observance and to the purifying Convent of 1763, at Altenberg. * * * Be that as if m ay, those exc luded from Altenberg has tened to reco nstitu te a sim ilar Order, for we see in 1767 Stark, dissident ex-m ember of the Strict Templar Observance (who within the Order had carried the nam e of Eques ab Aquila Fulva ) founded the Clerica t of the Templars . Main preacher at the C ourt of Hesse-Darm stadt, it was hardly s urpris ing th at his f unctio ns has allowed him to adm itted 14 .   Indeed th e o rien tation of these tw o currents were clearly contradictory... The Strict Templar Observance (aristocratic Masonry) leaned firstly towards reconstitu tin g the Order of the Temple of olden tim es, claim ing to be descended from them , via the Teutonic Order and the Order of Arms-Bearers . Then, the second step was to dem and the restitution of th e imm ense goods seized at the dissolution of the Order in 1312, at the Council of Vienna, from the Vatican. The Clerica t of the Tem plars , whos e las t and most secre t Degree only adm itted priests (no doubt of provenance and ordain ed by the Order itself) f ocused only on religious and m etaphysical speculat ion, as well as occult knowledge. It is the second m ove ment which needed to resolve to hide itself and to turn itself into a true secret society. Matter, who though his m other was the grandson of Rudolph of Salzm ann, and had inherited the latter’s arch ives, tells us the fo llowing in his book on “ Claude de Saint-Martin, the Unknown Philosopher ”: “These Russians, who, in 1741, gave Saint-Martin such an impressive w elcom e in London; were they Ma rtinis ts or Martinez ists ?

This is what is of ten ign ored. Still, a f act that Sain t-M artin m entioned bef ore this occasion appear s to prove that these were friends or followers of Don Martinez de Pasqually.” Indeed he adds this cu rious detail to his note: “Their Im peratrix, Ca therine II, h as deem ed it app ropr iate to com pose two com edies against th e Ma rtinists , against whom s he has taken um brage. These com edies only serve to increase th e sect. “He did no t ta lk of th is “Socie ty” to his friends, which in fact he had never founded... 15 ” Here, Saint- Martin comm itted a m istake, f or Cather ine I I never allude d to the Martinis ts when she asked the other Grimm to write the com edies: “ The Siberian Enchanter ” and “ The Blind Man ”. In explain ing the principal idea of the for mer, she wrote “The Enchanter is this theosophist who reprod uces all the charlatan ry of Paracelsu s”. In the second, she shows an Alchem ist and an Conjurer of Spirits: “W e should recognize Cagliost ro here”, declares Petroff in his “ History o f Russian Literature ”. A nd this is also wrong. In truth, in his “ Cagliostro, the Unknown Master ”, Dr. Marc Haven, who has especially studied the life of this strange man, explain ed the in itiatic perip le of the “Magus”.   “His jou rney en ded in Mitta u, in Cou rlan de (a t th is t ime an in depen dent S tate u nder th e protect orate of Pru ssi a).

For it is an easily provable fact that Cagliostro, before his arrival in Mittau, did not practice theurgy, high m agic, or any pneum atological science in ritual form , as one might have wished. 15 “ Il ne s’ag it pa s de ses amis à lu i, d e cette “So ciété”, qu’il n ’a, en fa it, j ama is, f ondée ...” m ore obtuse syntax fo r w hich I wo uld love a bet ter translation – PV. 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Tem plars & R ose C roix, T ranslated by Pi ers A Va ughan © 2 005 We have carefully followed the periple that the late lam ented Dr. Marc Haven attributed to his “ unknown master ”, in his beau tiful and sin cere work “ Cagliostro, the Unknown Master ”. We should rem ember in all si ncerity that Joseph Balsam o, alias Count of Cagliostro, bef ore m eeting Stark, ha d clear ideas about alch em y and spagyrics. He definitely traveled, and he had certainly been in what he still ca ll the “Steps o f the Levant 16 ” (Syria, Tunisia), for he knew and practiced the famous mirror o f ink of Arabic magicians 17 (Marc Haven, op. cit., P. 5, 29 th line). On the other hand he was not suf ficiently f amiliar with the im prescribab le ru les of m agic, even “high m agic”...He made m ista kes, comm itted om issions. W hen students who were m ore serious than the master, were astonished and worried by this , he replied by alleging that his knowledge and powers put his above rites. (Marc Have n, op.cit. p. 57). Now, our thaumaturge inspir ed con fidence in Marc Haven a century a nd a half later. But he aroused suspic ion in two of his contem poraries, who we will m eet later : Louis- Claude de Saint-Mar tin and Jean-Baptiste W illerm oz. Both k new Mart inez de Pas qually. That to th em was a sufficient criterion. W e concl ude, then, that before his arri val in Mittau, Joseph Balsamo only know the m agic of the “da gueze” of Northern Africa. Be that as it m ay, here we see Cagliostro in Ru ssia, and to what end we still do not know. But there he is. And not alone. Catherin e of Russia, wh en she was still fr iend to the Encyc lopedists, the partisans of social progress, sees the Count Saint-Germ ain run to her aid; and it is he, with his profound sense of m en, who coordinates all the energies necessary to ensure the success of the plot which will m ake her the so le m istre ss of all the Russias. (Se e “ The Mysterious Count Saint-Germain ” by Pierrere L herm ier, p. 168 et seq.). On the brin k of great p olitica l revo luti ons, P rovidence always sends mysterious agents to th ose who m ust eith er ced e their place or pres ide o ver neces sary m odifications. And always, other m ysterious agents, cohorts of counter-Providence , arrive in their turn to profit fro m this neces sary renewal, to d rive th e blind m asses toward s disorder, ch aos, and collective catas trop he. W hen one exam ines the unfolding of the gr eat upheavals in France, England and Russia, sees the renewal of this “duel of the m agicians” evoked by Matila Ghyka in his great work “ The Number of Gold ”. Against Count Saint-G erm ain stood Cagliostro; against Maîtr e Philippe and Papus stood Ras putin . We now understand, knowing that th ese R ussians were both Masons and occultists, e ven m ixing these two or ienta tions , who they w ere s imply af filiated to these Masonic rites which contained both a Templar and Gnostic character, which had m any manifestations in Sweden, Denm ark, Northern G erm any, Poland and Russia. When W illerm oz m ade the m embers of the Strict Observan ce adopt the ‘reform ’ of Lyons, at the Convent of W ilhelm sbad in 1782, the Duke of Sudermania, future King of Sweden, resigned; and he was Pr ovincial Grand Master of the VII th Province of the Order (Low Ger many).

Under the old form , Tem plar Masonry continued to grow in the No rth, above all in Swed en, and well after the death of Hund, and well after the “decisions” taken at the Convent. We find pr oof of this in the work of B. Fabre “ Franciscus, Eques a Capite Galeato ”, page 389, reproducing a letter from Chev alier Herm ensen, whi ch gives us this precious inform ation: “...Here it is fo r Hermeticism.

In this reply his correspondent, the Mar quis of Chefdebi en, gives us precious com plementary inform ation (in his letter of Setpember 4, 1806 to Chevalier Harm ensen): “...In th e Rectifica tio n of Sweden, which was held em inently close to that of a ce rtain place in Germ any ...” “No Rectifica tio n wa s en tert ain ed by the Gra nd Ma ster...” Chevalier Harm ensen was not a new-com er. In the sam e work we find his titles (p. 373): “Jean-Etienne-Juste d’Harm ensen, born in Paris on March 20, 1779, into the Lutheran religion and the Confession of Augsburg, ancien t indigenous noble of the P olish States, m ember of the States of Sweden, seated at Diète, form erly gentlem an of the Court of the reigning King of Sweden, S.M.

All the historians agree that 1754 is the final date when the apostolate of Don Martinez began, with the cr eation of his Chapter “ Scottish Judges ” in Montpellier. Now, at this tim e, the Convent of Kohl o had already taken place, where the first exclusion of occultists had occurred within the Tem plar resurgence. T his Convent had taken place in 1742, twelve years b efore. (Cf. Montchal, op. cit.). And the regions which saw the rebirth of the Order of the Temple , in the 18 th Century, were far from France: Riga, Varsovi a, Koenigsberg, Dresden, Iena, Stockhol m, Copenhagen.   18 See page 19 for the ori gin of this g rade, the Grand -Orien t of Bo uillon . 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Tem plars & R ose C roix, T ranslated by Pi ers A Va ughan © 2 005 In fact, Dr. Ernst Friedrichs, Professor of the Crops of Cadets, published in 1908 (Verlag von Franz W under, ed. Berlin) a study entitled: “ Freemasonry in Russia and Poland ”. In it we re ad the f ollowing : “On th e first p lane app eared in th is ag e the Strict Observa nce a nd the R ose-Croix ”. The age in question is the reign of E lizabeth Petrovna, which began in 1741, after the overthrow of Ivan VI, who was a child. It al so refers t o the foreign Masonic Lodges (Germ an, Swedish and English) which were pra cticing both the Tem plar Grades and the Jacobite Rosicrucian Grandes. Our author la ter explains that the Russians only really constituted associations of this type under Catherine II. But, foreign or not, we see that from 1741 Lodges were interested in occultism : “Man y cu ltivated peop le were mo reo ver i rrita ted by the fa ct tha t the Ma son s tried hard to penet rate the secret s of nature by me ans other th an scien tific exp erimen ts . T hey shi ed aw ay f rom the conquests of Science, and be lieved in secret doctrines , in Alchemy , Magic and the Kabbalah.

Petro ff: “ Histor y of Russian Liter ature ”.) Thus the M asons in Ru ssia p ractice d th e Occult Sciences and actually professed Gnosticism ... Besides, E. Friedrichs tells us in the sam e study (op. cit. p. 27) that, from 1776, all the Russian Lodges had adopted the Sw edish-Berlin System , which was the Strict Observance ! In Poland, it was the sam e:   “Th e first con stitu ted Lod ge wh ose name w e kn ow was the Lo dg e “ The Three Brothers ”, fo und ed in Va rso via in 1744 . Its f ound er w as Prin ce S tan isla s Lu bo rmisky.” (Op . cit. p . 53 ). This had as its source “a Germ an Lodge which was stil l flourishing, the “ Three Crowns ”, in Koenigsburg , as E. Friedrichs tells us: and th is town m akes us think of Baron Rod, quoted by Charles von Hesse in his letter to W illermoz, as being the first Grand Master of the Strict Observance; and in this same town... At the sam e tim e, Jean de Thoux de Salverte also founded his Lodge, “ The Good Shepherd ”, under the aegis of the Strict Observance, in w hich, a few years later, he introdu ced teachings relating to the Kabbala h and Alchemy. It is about him that Savalette de Langes, “snitching 19 ” on t he future m embers of the Convent of W ilhel msbad for the Marquis of Chefdebien, spoke thus: 19 “fi chant” – rea lly means making fun of, but I see not indi cat ion t hat he was ridiculing Sal vert e or the grou p – PV. 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Tem plars & R ose C roix, T ranslated by Pi ers A Va ughan © 2 005 “...h e ha s a lways been mystica l, kabba listic and hermetic.

Thus, between 1744 and 1755, there had been a Lodge at Varsovia teaching a doctrin e ver y similar to that of Don Martinez. And when, in 1776, the Duke of Suderm ania co nstitu ted the “Provincial Swedish Lodge” by a Ruling, he was only legitim izing in Russia a state of existence which was alre ady old, for the Sw edish-Ber lin system was at the o rigin of the m ajority of foreign Lodges founded in Russia. Besides, in his rem arkable book “ Occult Freemasonry and the Order of E lus Cohen ”, R. Le Forestier tells us of an anterior ity of the system of Don Martinez (p. 404): “The Grades of Apprentice, C omp anion a nd M aster ( of Mystica l Mas onry ), wh ich form ed an embr yonic yet very cohesive system, pr ovi ded s ome curi ous c onc ordanc es w ith the sce nes and cere moni es of the C ohen grades... “The notebook s of these Gr ades are re produced co mp letely in th eir Fren ch text on pag es 3 88-393 , volume II of Allge meines Ha ndbuch der Freim aurerei (ed. of 18 65); accordi ng t o a pri vate edi tion w hich the Ger man M ason Bo de, w ho playe d an i mport ant rol e in the Strict Tem plar Ob ser vanc e , had m ade for his pers onal collect ion. “It is imp ossible to kno w if th e Order o f Elus-C ohen imita ted ‘ Mystical Maso nry ’ or conve rsel y.

In consequence, where should one seek th e secret and esoteric source from which to draw the origin of the Neo-Tem plars and probably ‘ Mystical Masonry ’? Much earlier.

He tells us that, from the beginning of the 16 th Century, we can see a secret society called “T he Comm un ity of Mages” in operation, founded by Henry Cornelius Agrippa; an association which grouped together contem porary m asters of Magic and Alchem y. In 1510, Agrippa traveled to England, clai ming that he was called there on secret business. M oreover, it is ther e, as J. Orsier tells us in h is “ Henry Cornelius Agrippa: his life and work, through his correspondence ”, that he wrote his “ Commentaries on the Epistles of St. Paul .” He descended on the hom e of “the celebr ated Jehan Collet”, and as a result of his communications ( Opuscula , T.II, p. 1073), he founded an asso ciation sim ilar to the one in Germ any there. The he crossed back over the English Channel 20 and returned to Cologne, where he taught theology. One day he went to W urtzburg, in order to m ake contact with the fam ous abbot Tritheim 21 , the greates t occultist of these tim es. W e are indebted to him notably for his “ Ve terum Sophorum Sigilla et imagines magicae... ”, a rare treatise on m agical Seals and Im ages, called “ Treatise of Secondary Causes ”, and the celeb rated “ Steganographia hoc es t Ars per occultam .” It is as a re sult of this r elationship w ith Tritheim that Agrippa wrote his fa mous “Occult Philosophy, or Magic.” At the sam e tim e, as a result of his correspondences, Arippa had conferred upon the m embers of the two associations found by him the signs and words of probation. In their turn, J. Bricaud tells us, these members founded analogous societies, called Chapters , in several European States, for the secret study of the occult sciences. If we can believ e a m anuscrip t by Mi chael Maier, who was one of the m ost striking figures in the growth of Germ an Rosicrucianism , a m anuscript preserv ed in the Library at L eipzig, it wa s this “ Com munity of Mages ” which, around 1570, gave birth in Germ any to the “ Brothers of the Rosy Cross of Gold .” Then, in 1598, the “ Militia Crucifer a Evangelica ” was born at Nurem berg.

Renunciation of the things of the worl d, and “m arking out a passage towards the light, seekin g heaven and the heav’n ly breath 29 ”; these are th e aspirations of Sir Sidney and his friends. Celestial love is se t agains t te rre strial love. “Leave m e, O love which reachest b ut to dust ; And thou, my m ind, aspire to higher things ; Grow rich in that which never taketh rust, Whatever fades but fading pleasure brings.

Splendidis longum valedico nugis. ” This world, which the teach ings of Corneliu s Agrippa and Robert Fludd enflam ed, c ame together in London, in the “Siren” (m eaning Merm aid) Tavern and, as Paul Arnold tells in his penetrating study “Elizabethan Occu ltism ” (cf. in Cahiers du Sud No. 308 ), for half a century all the L ondon celebrities would m ake a beeline 30 there. Raleigh, Greene, Nash, Lily, Marlowe, Cha man, Ben Johnson, Kyde, Roydon, even Shakespeare 31 went there in 1612.

Yet it seem s however that all th e preoccupations of these people – Rosicrucians before the revelation of the nam e – never m ade them los e sigh t of a vast political program . * * * It is now known, in fact, that King Henr y IV was in contact with a conspicuous Rosicruc ian, Eirenaeus Philalethes. One suspects he adm itted as m uch to the kin g of France, giv en the need (for France) to br ing down the House of Austria, th at (for religious freedom ) the m arching wing of fana ticism m ight be overthrown. Let us not forget that the Reform ation had b een the wo rk of the Rosicrucian m ove ment, and that Henry IV was first and fore most a Protestant 32 . One cannot really see the reason for the twenty-two attem pted assassinations of the ki ng during his reign, if one surm ises from the atta cks a lin k f irst of all with a f oreigner, and with the surviv ors of the League later on 33 . Henry IV envisaged the creation of a sort of ag reem ent between the Eu ropean Sta tes, an agreem ent analogous to that of the sm all reform ed states in Germ any. It is this which history has set down under the nam e of the “ Grand Design .” Now, it was done to restore the great initiative of the Tem plars... (see the “Secret of Knighthood 34 ” by V.E. Michelet). The sam e causes give birth to the sam e effects; and the s ame opposition m ust follow. It resulted in the assassination of the king, on the eve of when he was going to set his proje cts in motion . But what the public knew less clearly was how Henry IV was going to achieve his “Grand Design”. Curious f act: the on ly s overeign co nsulted abo ut an eventu al alliance was righ tly Jam es VI of Scotland, King of England under th e na me of Ja mes I, following the death of Elizabe th. I t is th is same Jam es VI who went to see Tycho Brahé and W illiam IV ‘The Wise’; who wrote a treatise on pneum atology; who took a deep interest in m etaphysical and theological controversies; and w hose father, Jam es V of Scotland, in 1540, had just   32 Un réf ormé – PV. 33 Perh aps it’ s m y lack of kn owled ge of histo ry, bu t th is do esn ’t m ake m uch sen se to m e.

To be honest, Jam es VI was rather lukewarm about the “Grand Design,” not because he d id not agr ee with overthrowing the d angerous power of the House of Austria, but because, being a conservative despite him self, since he was both English and Scottish, the people of the Low Countries rem ained rebe ls in his eyes : and besides, if he was an initiate, and if he had surrounded hi mself with people of worth, by consulting the stars and by all other m eans he would have been able to discern that it would be from the Low Countries that those doctr ines originated which would lead to his son, Charles I, being decapitated; and that a Hanoverian would com e from these sam e Low Countries to replace his grandson on the th rone of the United Kingdom . Be that as it m ay, at th e las t m oment , Jam es VI pulled out. L ike H enry IV, although of a different religion, he rem ained ever antipapist . It was this point tha t both shared with the Rose-Croix , if we believe the “public” m anifestation of the latter in 1614. Should we also see Rosicrucian political activity in the conspiracy of Sir Walter Raleigh, who was a habitué of “The Siren”? W e don’t know. Perhaps there were nothing but m ystics and occultists am ong them.   But let us re turn to the Rose-Croix in England. We Rosicrucian groups were then born at the beginning of the 17 th Century. One, sim ilar to th e “ Brothers of the Cross of Gold ” becam e the Aurae Crucis . The secon d group, m ore num erous, for med a special attachm ent with what it is convenient to call Official Science. It devoted its works to experim ental re search and the study of nature, and took the nam e Rosae Crucis . Shortly thereafter, this second m ovem ent founded the Invisible Colleg e , which then becam e, as officially recognize d by King Charles II , the Royal Socie ty . We should not im agine that Jam es VI of Scotland was a unique case in the history of the Stuarts. His son, Charles I, was inte rested in Illum inism . In the preface to his translation of the work of Jacob Boehm e, “The Rising Dawn 35 ”, a work published in Am sterdam in 1682, Louis-Claude de Sa int-Martin tells us the following: “...There w ere two (groups) in England, both very dis tinguished, the one by their knowledge, the others by their rank. Am ong t he second, one can cite King Charles I who, accord ing to authentic testim ony, m ade arrangem ents to encou rage the pub licatio n of the works of Jacob Boehm e in Englis h, particularly the one called “Mysterium Magnum ”, or “The Great Arcana”. “It is also reported that, in 1646, when he read the work entitled “Forty Questions on the Soul”, the King m ade lively witness of his adm iration, cryi ng out: “May God be 35 L’A urore N aissant – PV . 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Tem plars & R ose C roix, T ranslated by Pi ers A Va ughan © 2 005 praised !

He is recognized as be ing the tr ansla tor and editor of all the work s of Boehm e in English, which however did not s ee the ligh t of day until af ter the reestablishm ent of Charles II, in the years of 1661 and 1662.”   So the son a ffirmed the work of the father... There are many curious things in this path of esoteric thought in Great Britain, under the shrewd protection of its Kings. And i nvincibly, the spirit was led to this Anglo- Scottish cus tom which held that the elders of their dynas ty bore the first nam e of Da vid; who held that the anointing and corona tion h ad as its essen tial par adig m the bethel on which Jacob had had his vision of the h eavenly s taircase, th e “Coronation Stone 36 ” whose ownership the English and Scotti sh have disputed for centuries . One m ight also recall the trad ition ab out the ten Jewish trib es of the m ysterious ex odus of Rehoboam , son of Solom on, which held th at this fraction of Isr ael finally arriv ed in the British Isles. The Phoenician s, traveling on the tin trade route 37 , would have been docum ented as mysterious em issaries 38 ... The Fama and the Confession of Valentin Andreas, orig inal prom oter of the first public m anifestation of the Rose-Croix, we re translated into English by Thom as Vaughan, au thor of “An throposophia Theom agica” and m any other boo ks on occu ltism. Although he denied it, Vaughan was, in reality, one of the heads of the Rose-Croix . In his “Athenae Oxoniensis”, W ood tells us that “He was a great chym ist, a son of distinguished line, an expert physician, a nd an assiduous Brother of the Rosicrucian Fratern ity ”. 36 Trad itio n (legen d) affirm s that it is th e same ston e st on e wh ich Jacob used as a pillo w at Beth el and then set up as a pill ar a nd anointe d with oil: later, according to Jewish tr adition (possi ble lege nd), it becam e the pede stal of the ark in the Tem ple.

Founded i n the Teutonic Order , the Order of Knights Arms Bearers then saw the Strict Observance born. Then Kabbalists, Mages, Alchem ists a nd Theosophists penetrated these Lodges, despite the periodic purgings. These occult ists cam e from Rosicrucian cenacles founded by Agrippa, Maïer, Andrae, etc. These cenacle s often enjoyed the s upport and interest of the m inor Germ an princes. Later on, one may claim that, from the beginning of Masonry, C ourlande was filled with Lodges, all in the Strict Observance line (E . Friedrichs, op.cit.). The Templar Clericat of Stark, the m an who taught his adepts cerem onial m agic, “which was never spoken of without terror”, had its center at Mittau, in Courlande... It was the sam e in England. You can be the judge! The last branch of the Templars of Great Britain (this Order of Sa int Andrew of Char don, which we will exam ine later) was, in its turn, penetrated by English Rosicrucians and, like the Germ an branch, had at its base a fi est external circle d estined to serv e as a siev e: Freemasonry . In England, the best known m embers of the Rosae Crucis were: Elias A shm ole, Robert Moray, Thom as Warton, George W arton, W illiam Oughtred, Joh n Herwitt, J ohn Prarson and W illim a Lilly (the f amous astro loger ). To better co nceal its existence and activ ity, which it wished to be pu rely occult, the Order d ecided to integra te itse lf into an average env ironm ent, which gave it an official name, place s to m eet, and degrees wh ich allowed it to filter po ssib le cand idate s. Following the custom of the tim es, which required every citizen with th e right to freedom of the city of L ondon to be a m ember of a trade group as an accepted member (tha t is to s ay, honorary member ), Elias Ashmole af filia ted with th e Brotherhood of Mason constructors which grouped together m asons, st onecutters, m asters of the work, etc., from the art of building. He then solicited autho rization f or the Rosae Crucis to m eet at the sea t of this Brotherhood at Mason’s Hall in Mason’s Alle y, Basinghall Street in London. It was his “Brother” and friend, W illiam Pr eston, who reveals th e subterfuge in his book: “ Illustrations of Masonry ”. Within a short tim e the English Rosicruc ian s had m ultiplied th e num ber of “speculativ e” affiliates within Operative Mason ry. Elias As hm ole (born on May 3, 1617, 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Tem plars & R ose C roix, T ranslated by Pi ers A Va ughan © 2 005 died May 1 8, 1692), commissioner of King Cha rles I at Litchfield, was received into the Rosae Crucis by W illiam Backhouse in 1644, G. Montchal tells us ( op.cit . p. 53). On October 16, 1644, he was received into th e Corporation of Op erative Masons at Warrington, under the patronage of Richard P enkett, W arden of Fellow Crafts. Forty- two years la ter, the Rosicruc ian “penetration” of English Freem asonry was achieved, as we shall see. * * * In an anonymous work, published in Ge neva in 1909, not published generally and reserved only to Masons of the Rectif ied Rite of Switzerla nd: “ The Scottish Rec tified Rite ”, we r ead this : “16 88 Jam es I I an d hi s C ourt were est ablished i n the C hateau of Sai nt-Germ ain-en-L aye, whe re the first Sco ttish Rite Lodg e was foun ded in France, with high er grad es. (Jam es II died in th is resi dence in 1701, and his s on was procl aimed Ki ng of Engl and there unde r the nam e of Jam es III ). “It was d uring the rei gn o f this Ki ng of Sai nt-Ge rm ain (f rom 1701 to 17 18) t hat H.- G. de Marshall, he reditary Marshal l of Thuringe, directly recei ved the true “high gra des” of Scottish Rite Freem asonry and brought them from Sai nt-Germ ain t o Germ any . B aron vo n H und, hi s fri end, i nherited hi s Masoni c pa per s.” The path followed by Ashm ole and his frie nds had been very sim ple. The English Rose-Croix had penetrated Operative Ma sonry (English Com pany) as “accepted (honorary) m embers” . Many ot her English subjects have sin ce followed this example, sure of finding som ething other than a purel y corporative and hard-working am bience in “Lodge”. The environm ent beca me a philoso phical and even m etaphysical cenacle. When Jam es II d isem barked in F rance and in stalled him self at Sa int-Germ ain, m any were the gentlem en in his train – officers of faith ful Regim ents f ollowing the King into ex ile – who were Freem asons. In “ Freemasonry in France ” by Bord, we read this (page 51), which confirm s what has preceded : “In 16 89 we see Sco ttish and Irish Reg iments d isembark in Fran ce with th eir m ilitary cad res and their Mas onic cadres .” For it is uncontestable that the Stuart s supported Catholic Freem asonry (called “Jacobite”), to counter the House of Hanove r, which supported Protestant Freem asonry. Now, hardly had he disembarked in Fran ce, when Jam es II, f or the benef it of his faithful gentlem en, reopened a Chivalric Order which, although the here ditary property of his House, had already been extin guished sev eral tim es in the cour se of History. This Order was “Saint Andrew of Chardon of Scotland”. Here is its origin. Galiffe, in his book “ Symbolic Chain ”, tells us that, at th e height of the Crusades, towards the end of the 12 th Century, there were Corporative English “Lodges”, adm inistered by the Or der of the Temple , and that because of this the English Provincial 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Tem plars & R ose C roix, T ranslated by Pi ers A Va ughan © 2 005 Grand Master of the Templars had becom e the honorary “Patr on” of the Brotherhood in this nation. Clavel, in his “ Picturesque History of Freemasonry ”, also tells us that from 1155 to 1199, forty-four years, English Corpor ate “Lodges” were adm inistered by the Temple . Montrachel, in his “ History of the Grand Pr iory of Switzerland ”, plaus ibly te lls u s that the “close alliance” which seem s to have existed in all ag es between the Brotherhoods of Operative Masons and the Or der of the Temple, explains the welcom e which was reserved in a num ber of countries, but above all in the British Isles, for the fugitive Knights, after th e abol ition o f their Order at the Coun cil of Vienn a (1311-131 2). From that tim e one better understands from that tim e the plausibility of the gesture of King Robert Bruce, when afte r his victory of Bannockburn in 1314, won over the English troops of King Edward II, calle d the “Poltroon” (being only two years after the abolitio n of the Order of the T emple ), he institu ted the Order of Saint Andrew of Chardon to honor the best knights of his arm y and the Militia of the Temple , who had fought in their ranks. The Order went to sleep for a long tim e afterwards. Reestablished in 1540, it wa s resurrected in 1687 before the arrival at Sain t-Germ ain-en-Laye. “Still, ” the Grand Encyclopedia tells us, “it never went be yond the antecham bers of Saint-Germ ain...” In fact, rese rved officially for Irish a nd Scottish gentlem en, and thus of necessity Catholic, h e conf erred it officiously upon th ose were m embers of several m ilitary “Lodges” constitu ted within each regim ent: for Jacob ite (and therefore Cath olic) Freem asonry was, in fact, also a vehicle acting in favor of the restoration of the Stuarts. This is historic fact. The existen ce of this Catholic M asonry is indisputab ly attes ted in a histor ic docum ent of prim ary i mportance. The “ Memoir es ” of Elias Ashm ole, published by Ch. Bur man in London in 1717, tell us that: “O n October 26, 1646, at Warrington, in the Lancashire, I was created a Freem ason with Colonel Mainwaring, from Karisham .” (cf. Lantoine, op.cit. page 10 39 ). From what has prec ede d, it f ollowe d that the title of Knight of Saint A ndrew of Scotland rap idly becam e a sim ply Masonic “grad e”, since it was conferred the m ajority of tim es within these Stuart “Lodges”.. Thus, H.-G. Marshall, hereditary Ma rshall of Thuringe, on com ing from Naum bourg (location of his Lodge of Strict Observance ) to Saint-Germ ain-en-L aye, could only receive what he already p ossessed, being the s ecret lin eage of the Templars ...   39 In a l etter a ddressed t o Albert Bernet , Bernard Fay confi rms that he ha s in his han ds, in the U nited St ates, unc ontestabl e ol d d ocum ents sho wing the existence of Specu lative Ma sonry from the 1 6 th Century . 27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Tem plars & R ose C roix, T ranslated by Pi ers A Va ughan © 2 005 This lineage was already known at that tim e. W hen one recalls the letter of Ram say, Knight of Saint Lazarus, Sc ottish Baron et, Prec eptor to the ch ild ren of Jam es II, deceased at Saint-Germ ain, the letter which is, in the words of hi storians, the first manifestation of the existence of high grades in Freem asonry: “ Th e name o f Freema son must n ot be ta ken in a litera l – co arse an d materia l – sen se, as if o ur founde rs had been simple workers in stone... but al so rel igious pri nces and war riors , w ho w ish t o cl ari fy, edify and protect th e “Livin g temp les” o f the Mo st Hi gh. ” ( Cf. Al bert Lantoine : “Freem asonry at hom e”, p. 117) . Let us repeat, it would be a serious m istake to suppose that the Templar Strict Observance had not preserved what had com e to it from the Teutonic Knights (and t he Knights Arms Bearers ), its first founders, holding the very principles of the Order of the Temple . T he dem ocratic, m odern spirit was unknown to them ; on the contrary, the chivalric tra dition was m aintained with rigo r: “ Knighthood may only be accorded to Brothers of noble birth, with the exception of particu larly distingu ished subjects. Commoners may only receive the title of Squire 40 .” In fact, when one refers to the “Rule” of the Tem ple of form er tim es, and one sees tha t in orde r to e nter the Tem ple M ilitia , it is necessary to be a knight , and the son of a knight , being two quarters of required nobility. In the Order of the Temple , one was not dubbed, but sim ply received. It was an “af filiation”. It is true that the title of Squire, reserv ed f or commoners, was alread y a beginning to ennoblem ent, at least in France and England. The Edicts of 1579, 1583 and 1600 defined them . Louis XIII ordered that commoners who usurped the title should be punished by a fine. It is this which the Restoration gave to the newly-ennobled. * * * So, the panoram a of Rosicrucian activity is n ow com plete, in Engla nd as in Germ any. For the former, the Rosicrucians , arising from the common ac tion of Robert Fludd and Agrippa, penetrated into Operative Freemasonry , attracting Stuartist gentlem en, and mixed with them . Then, the Order of Saint Andrew , revived in Saint-Germ ain, became exclusively Masonic: and th rough H.-G. Marshall, passed into the hands of Germa n Masonic Templars. As previous ly f or the la tter, the Order of Knight Arms Bearers of Livonia were founded in the Teutonic Order , from which, one day, the Strict Templar Observance mysteriously arose (well penetrated by th e Germ an Rosicruc ians a s well), which officially dem anded the return of the belongings of the ancient Tem plars of for mer tim es... To bette r settle the v alid ity of its line age, the hea d of the Ger man Templars, H.-G. Marshall, G erm an knight, cam e to Saint-Germ ain to receive the dubb ing of Knight of   40 Cf. P.

Monchal, op.cit.). That Charles-Edward, the Pretender, late r denied that he had been a Freem ason, this neither adds nor takes away from what precedes. Let us also em phasize that th e argum ent of Charles-Edward, alleging that hi s father had f orbidden him to enter Freem asonr y (cited by Albert La ntoine, op. cit.), has som e credibility. In fact, on the accession of Ja mes VI of Scotland as King of England, Operativ e Masonry in Scotland took back its independenc e, and its right to choose its own Grand Master. His entry into Freem asonry would in consequence h ave place th e Pretender in a hum iliating position for a sover eign, as he woul d be d iscip linarily subm itting to one of his subjects in Freem asonry... And Albert Lantoine repo rts this (op.cit. p. 109): “Later, in 1780, Charles Edward affirmed by letter that h e had never been a Mason and to have ignored its customs. Fraud? And on what s ide? A single explanation seems plausible. The E nglish hist orian Robert Burns s poke of the Orders of Chardon and Kilwinnin g and the Knights Rose-Croix . It is in this las t Order, acco rding to us, tha t Charles Ed ward would have been received as Grand Master. This was not Freem asonry ... In Scotland, these Rose-Croix per haps remained independent of the Lodges, not influenced by them, but by the Order of Chardon . That would have allowed the Pretender to deny all par ticipation in Masonic works...” Later, in 1773-1774, about two years be fore his death, Baron von Hund affirm ed by oath, “on his sword and his honor as a ge ntlem en”, that the Unknown Superior who m he had m et at the Chapter of Clermont in 1754, and from whom he received his powers, was Charles Edward, P retend er to the th rone of Scotland, “Eques a penna rubra”, in ordine. (Op. cit.., p. 213). Is it plausible to suppose that a ge ntlem an like von Hund lied in such grave circum stances, in an age when a perjured gentlem an was very se verely punished? W e don’t think so! There is no doubt that, wh en interrogated later on, Charles Edward affir med he had never been a Freem ason, desp ite his strong desire to becom e one , his father having forbidden him , but who can prove that this was not a play on words ? F or at this tim e, M asonry was above all Symbolic Masonry , that of Apprentices, Com panions and Masters, and the high grad es were called “chiva lric”. It is th eref ore pe rfectly possible tha t the Preten der had used this Jesuitica l form to attenua te the tru th! The affir mation of Charles E dward (1780) to the Duke of Sudermanie ( op.cit, p. 214) was in a double sense. This is also the opini on of Albert Lantoi ne (op.cit., p.109). For in any e vent, Charle s Edward had th e fam ous Chevalier Ram say as Precepto r to his children, author of the fam ous le tter on the high grades of Free masonry. 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Tem plars & R ose C roix, T ranslated by Pi ers A Va ughan © 2 005 In Paris, Charles Edward stayed in a hotel in the Faubourg Po issonnière in which the Chevalier Bénouville one day sent to the Baron von Hund the high grades of the Strict Templar Observance “prem aturely”. (Alber t L antoine, op. cit.). Charles Edward m ade frequent stays at the Chateaud de Bouillon, where Charles- Godefroy, Duke of Bouillon, and his friend the Duke of Rohan, cons titu ted the f amous and m ysterious “Grand Orient of Bouillon ” (Cf . G. Bord: “ French Freemasonry ”). All the s ame... This would be confirm ed by he prudence with which the fam ous agenda of the Convent of Brunswick (1775) was run, whos e text, according to Albert Lantoine, follows: “The Agenda contained the item “ that the House of Stuart which was generally believed to be in possession of the hereditary Grand Mastership has, for many years, either been unable to or not wished to c oncern itself with the affairs of the Order , this tacit renun ciation perm its the election of another Grand Mast er” (Cf. Albert Lantoine, op.cit., p.213) A sim ilar te xt conf irm s all this. T his is the R itua l m anuscrip t of the Jacobite Rose-Croix, published by G. Bord in his book: “ Freemasonry in France ” (p. 512), manuscript of F ∴ Devaux d’Hugueville, dated 1746. In this text, we find the following passages: “Art icle 1 – Duty of an R.C . towards his G od and his Pri nce. A C hev ∴ mu st ado re his go d and def end hi s Pri nce t o the l ast dro p of hi s b lood, a nd ca nnot , under a ny pret ext , pass to the servi ce of a forei gn Pri nce without per mission of his Pri nce a nd hi s su periors.” One cannot deny that, for sure, we find in this a fitting preo ccupation to serve the inte rests of a king in ex ile, m ore po litica l tha n Masonic. But we should not forget that Stuartist Masonry existed long be fore the fall of the Stuarts ... and the importance of this is a lso und erlined by the grad e of the Ancien t Accep ted Scottish Rite which, ev en nowadays, includes a “Grand Scot of the Sacr ed Vault of Jam es VI”, the Jam es VI of Scotland wh o becam e Jam es I of Great Br itain an d was passio nate abou t theurgy... This Grade was transm itted from 1741 by the “Union” Lodge in Berlin, so Findel tells us, as cited by Albe rt Lantoine. The fam ous Acta La tomorum also tells us tha t the Count of Schm ettau, initiated in France into the Scottish grad es, introduced them into the “Judica” Lodge in Hamburg. Note the pa rallel with th e sym bols which f ollow: - the Knights Arms Bearers of L ivonia had as an em ble m two swords placed in a cross of Saint Andrew; - the Knights of Saint Andrew of Chardon had as an em blem the sam e Saint, standing behind a cross of Saint Andrew; 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Tem plars & R ose C roix, T ranslated by Pi ers A Va ughan © 2 005 - Valentin An drae had as a seal four bloom ing rose s in the in terse ctions o f a cros s of Saint Andrew; - the Stuarts (branch of Lennox) bearing as arm s four bloom ing red roses in the inte rsec tions of a cross of Saint Andrew which is also red, all on a white f ield.

This is what Jean Bricaud tells us about this in his “ His toric Notice on Martin ism ” (p. 4): “In Bo rdeau x I ra ised a Temp le to the Glory o f th e Grand Arch itect, com prisi ng th e fi ve p erfect orders, wh ich I am t he depo sito ry, under the con stitu tio n of Cha rles Stua rt, King of Scotla nd , Irel and an d En gland, Gr and Ma ster of al l regul ar Lodge spre ad acr oss the surf ace of the eart h, t his day, under the protection of Geo rge-Willia m, Kin g of Grea t Brita in, an d und er t he title o f “ Sco ttish Elect Perfectio n .” At the s ame t ime, at the Gr and Lodge of France, he addressed a co py of the P atent, in English, delivered May 20, 1738, by the Gra nd M aster of the Lod ge of Stua rt , to his fa ther, “ Don M artinez   41 In 194 3, fiv e Martin ists b elon ging to th e resu rgence of the Elus-C ohe ns in terro gated th e Astral Oracle,.

And from all which has proceeded, what are we to conclud e? This... In 1768 (his letter of Septem ber 2) he te lls us that the Brothe rs of Aubenton have been his disciples for more than ten years. Therefore his apostolate began around 1758. Also, a German Mas on, Er nst-Frederic -Hec tor Falcke (whom s hould not be conf use d with Falc “Lea der of Al l the Jew s” sp oken of by Savalette de La nges in his not es t o Chefdebien) , ass ures us (in hi s letter to Mu nd of 17 78: cop y to th e Grand Orien t of Ha ye, Klo ss co llectio n), th at “Ma rtin ez wa s Spanish , and t hat he w as in posse ssi on of a here ditary de posi t bel onging t o his family for m ore t han three ce nturies, in Spa in. Th ey were a lso pa rt o f th e Inq uisitio n, for so me o f his an cesto rs had taken pa rt.” This fact proves nothing. Possessing doc um ents about Theurgy and the Kabbalah by m eans of confiscation, would confer nothing hered itary on the m ales of the Pas cualis fam ily of the sacram ental powers o f the ancien t Cohanim or priests of Israel. It is one thing to possess Rituals; another thing to ha ve the right, the “power” to put them in action. From all which precedes , we conclu de that th e d octrines of the Elus-Cohen were not their own. Long before Martinez, a good number of Ger man and Swedish Masonic rites practiced and taught Th eurgy, the Kabbalah and Pneum atology. Le Forestier tended to conclude as we have seen ) that Mystic Mason ry was the inspira tion of the theor ies and works of Martin ez. The “powers” of Martinez de Pasqually w ould therefore not have been hereditary, as som e of his disciples wr ongly believed, but simply acquired by the Master by m eans of the intiato ry path, in the esoteric m ilieu preced ing his own Elus-Cohen . Let us add that, particularly endowed for “La Chose”, he had a ll the qualities requisite to becom e hea d of a school in his turn, and to give to that school a personal aspect which had never been equalled. It is also possibl e that he possessed texts truly seized in former tim es by his ancesto r inq uisito rs f rom the Kabbalis tic Jews of Spain. It is equally possible that these texts su cceeded in conv incing his ancestors of th e value of their occult teach ings. It is also possible that Martinez had simply drawn from the esoteric cenacle s of his time th e mysterious psychic “po wer” which incontes tably gave a truly occult and efficient initiation. It is even possi ble that be m et Swede nborg in London or in Sw itzerland, and that he h ad “ orien ted” M artinez towa rds opera tiv e m ysticism . “A sing le rema rk is a llo wed to me, says Gé rard V an Ri jnberk in his w ork “M art inez de Pa squa lly” (T.I., p. 49 , 50). Th e orig ins of th e id eas of Ma rtin ez ha ve often been discussed . Mo lito r a nd Le Forestier s trove to find them in the Je wish Kabbalah.

(Even the ritual of the “ Great Operation ” was never com pleted! (Cf. Le Forestier, p. 73)). We can therefore summarize the re sults of this lit tle inquiry on the Mar tinez ist lineag e: 1. If Martinez, by way of inheritan ce, possessed m anuscripts seized by his inquisitor ancestors from Kabbalistic Jews in Spain, this would not be sufficient for him to be perm itted to trans mit what he consider ed to be a priesthood . He could at the very most diffuse these theories. There is a big difference. 2. If Martinez was a converted Jew, or of Jewish provenance, born of c onverted Jews, and if an esoteric Judaic priesthood ha d secretly been deposited in his fam ily transm issible f rom m ale to m ale (an d his “ baptism ” of his son by him self, with a view to his succeed ing him later, tends to lend credence to this), it is astonish ing that ins tead of benefiting the Jews (and he frequented Jewi sh circles), he would have benefited the goyim , of which one was a Catholic priest (the Abbé Fournier). 3. If he had been in possessio n of true d ocum ents and teach ing s, having resurrected a practice, hereditary to his fam ily, of a secret theurgic cult, he would not have pawed the ground and varied so often at the tim e of the Treatis e. He would have drawn directly from these arch ives, where all would necessarily have been set out beforehand. 4. If these docum ents had existed, he woul d have shown them to his intim ates, to those who had worked so long in his com pany, transcribing under his dictation, chapter by chapter, the elem ents of his fam ous Treatise . None of them ever reported having seen Martinez going through anything. At his death, nothing was found i n his papers in Bordeaux. His wife never indicated the existe nce of tangible docum ents. His son did not inherit anything. To conclude, all this leads us to believe, m ore sim ply, that he studied or was versed in Ju daic eso tericism , the Kabbalah, or a very elev ated for m of this latter tradition, 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Tem plars & R ose C roix, T ranslated by Pi ers A Va ughan © 2 005 for we should note that he ignores the Sephiroth and th e entire cla ssic system . By contrast, he m ade a curious am algam of G nosticism , Origenism and completely p ersonal theories. Following the exam ple of the head of the schools which he had encountered in the mystic Mas onic m ilieu of this epo ch, he had wanted to create h is own school, an Order, which perpe tuated wha t he had disco vered or inte llec tually bu ilt. In transposing a Judeo-Christian dom ain those gifts uniquely used before him by practical Kabbalah, he presented a true spiritualization of High Magic. Contrarily to the adepts of his age, who were seekers of the philosophical stone, curi ous about the Beyond, and “in teres ted” m agicians, he created a cad re which was inf initely more respe ctable towards these practices, and, we r ecognize, this is no sm all merit. But his system (to which one cannot deny a m ost high initiatory value), is definitely from hi m, and his sacram ental lineage (uniting the so uls of the elite, uninterested in any m aterial advant age) proceeds directly from hi m... * * * However, a few curio us f acts s till rem ain to point ou t in th e lif e of this extrao rdinary m an, facts which, p erhaps, are really in a p osition to confer upon him a place in the Order of the Temple . We know fr om m any historical studies that well after its foundation, the rigor of the Rule was lessened. Very m any m arried Kni ghts had been received into the Order. There were “Dam es” of the Temple . And the proud Tem plar lineag e had been able to be secretly perpetuated in certain fam ilies of country nobility. W e have been to ld in particular of an exam ple of this type in the Franche-Com té region, in the m ountains of Jura. Do not forget that, at the moment of the destruction of the Temple , it was enough to travel a hundred leagues to be totally and definitiv ely unkn own. Identify cards didn’t exist; there were neither books, nor newspapers , nor radio; photography did not exist; and paintings extrem ely rare. Apart from a fe w monks, notaries and sc ribes (which were no common), nobody knew how to rea d or write. A signet ring, a seal, a vague text on parchm ent, even sto len , and one had a new identity... It is ex trem ely possib le that the Brothe rs of the Order escaped without having to go far. But in the case of Martinez de Pasqually, it is perhaps even sim pler. We know that he was nam ed Don M artinez de P asqually . Th at his father as also nam ed thus, that he was a squire (first degree of nobility). O rthography tells us li ttle. If the autho rs who lost them selves in critiqui ng this poin t had been f amiliar with old genealogy, nobilities, arm orials, etc, they wo uld have realized th at orthography held absolutely n o interest for our forefathers! The p lurality of n ames, too. Firstly one had a patronym , and one added the nam e of his land or lands, with the title of “Sire of ...”. 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Tem plars & R ose C roix, T ranslated by Pi ers A Va ughan © 2 005 This is no t to sim plify the m atter. The Mo ntm orencys were ca lled Bouchard ; the Castellanes were called Boniface, the B ourbons were called Capet; the Monacos, Grim aldi. That Martinez was Spanish or even Portugue se in origins, is a confirm ed fact. Nobody opposes his being born in Grenoble. Now, at the destruction of the Ord er of the Temple , the Spanish and Portuguese Militia were declared innocent by the Bis hop of Lisbon and by th e Assem blies of Tarragona and Salam anca (C f. John Charpentier: “ The Order of the Templars ”, p. 217). The King of Portugal, Denys I, who m erite d the beautiful nam es of “Liberal King” (note...), “Worker Kin g”, “Father of the Cout ry”, took th e initia tiv e to delegate Jean Leurenti, Knight, and Pierre Petri, Canon of Coï mbre, to go to Pope John XXII, successor to Clem ent V, at Avignon, to obtain the preser vation of the Order. After six years of reflection, the Pope afforded satisfaction to Denys I. The Order, thus establ ished, took the nam e of “ Knights of Christ ” (r eme mber that this was on e of the n ames of the Templars ). Its Rule was that of the Knights of Calatrava , and on March 15, 1319 t he first Grand Master took the Obligation on behalf of all the m embers. Do we know the nam e of this Grand Master? He was called Don Giles Martinez, and he was Portuguese ... This no doubt explains the role played by the ancestors to which Don Martinez de Pasqually made allusion. Let us never forget the im portance of the “ Temple ”, with a ll the significance beneath this word, in our theurgy. For him , the Universe is the Cosmic Temple . For him , the Masonic Lodge is th e im age of the Cosmic Temple . For him , Man-Archetype is expressed by the Temple of Solomon . And the Repairer , that is to say the Christ, in his special language, is also sym bolized by the Temple . The Tem ple of Solom on, m arvel of ancien t Jer usalem , execute d by order of the King accord ing to the instruction and followin g the secret plans received by Dav id his father, by the arch itect Hiram and the com panion-builders of the Tyrian Corporations, was constru cted in the image of the Man-Archetype and that of the Universe. “To study the s ecret sym bol ism of the Tem ple of Sol om on, is to study both the o ne and the ot her.” Such were the subject of the secret teach ings of the Elus-C ohen , summarized in fragm ent 3 of Manuscript 5475 in the Library of Lyons. 35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Tem plars & R ose C roix, T ranslated by Pi ers A Va ughan © 2 005 The Tem ple is thus an esoteric element and perm anent prophecy. It bears in itself the plans of its own relative destiny, a reflection of the Et ernal Divine of Man and the Cos mos. By analogy it is identified to those who unite them . An emblem atic Microcos m of the Macrocosm , true m irror of stone in which is reflected the First Architect: Adam Kadmon. At the s eco nd stage, th e five ess ential obje cts of the Sanc tuary which are the Seven-Bran ched Candlestick, the Airian Sea, the Altar of Holocausts, and th at of Perfum es, the m ysterious Ark of the Cove nant; these five obj ects of redoubtable consecrations, are but Sym bols, Pentacles in three dim ensions, theophoric centers of the Five “Appearances” of the Ancient of Days of the Kabbbalah (the Persona of Latin Christianity) ; the m ystica l and theu rgic Attribu tes of the Essential Name : Yeheshouah , the Great Nam e of Five Letters. That is say that, in order to unde rstand the secret esotericism of the Temple of Solomon , to gain acces s to the ideological currents which bear the fateful word, the true “ name of power ” f ar bef ore our tim e, and to rece ive the u ltim ate te aching s of the Eternal Initiator identified with it, one m ust oneself have occultly lived one’s own construction, ruin and symbolic resurrection. “Destro y th e Temp le, and I w ill reb uild it in three days,” C hrist tells u s (Mark, XIV) . We are told that Chris t died at the ag e of thirty-three, the duration of the tropical year of the sun. No te that the first T emple of Solom on was destroyed at the end of thirty- three years ... These thing s only a mystical Master Mason can perceive, he who knows the Acacia and its sym bolism ; who, dea d in th e sh adows of Hikal, with Hiram , like Hiram, architect of the Tem ple, is raised ag ain, “ twice-born ”, in a ll the glo ry o f the illum inated Debhir, with the star, an d with the M aster ... This will n ever be un derstood by a profane, because h e has never lived it psychically. But in order to understand the esotericism of the Te mple of Jerusalem , he m ust have lived the death and resurre ction of Hiram, so to com e to an understanding of the Celestial T emple, one m ust achieve it in oneself , and theurgic ally liv e to its reconstruction, and also its safeguard . Martinez de Pasqally taught nothing else. Such is the second Architect o f the Temple , the en igm atic Zerubbabel whose legend an d nam e conceals one of his high g rades, in which the Elus-Cohen opera te b oth upon them selves and upon the Universe, thro ugh the channel of this cosm ic plasm a which is th e Astral Ether , to which Plato had already attributed th e im age of the Dodecahedron, sym bol of the Celestial City. In do ing this th e Cohen , disciples of Martinez, w orked towards the reco nstruction and defense of the Te mple, the esoteric 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Tem plars & R ose C roix, T ranslated by Pi ers A Va ughan © 2 005 im age of Collec tive Man , of the Third Tem ple which the Christ, or “ Re pairer ”, was the new Hiram , the un iqu e Architect. This Mys tica l City was called Iona , t he “Gr eat Communion of Saints” (Cf. Stanislas de Guaita: “ The Serpent of Genesis ”, Tom e II). Why do people not recognize that, psychologically , Martinez de Pasqually exposed by his own doctrine? W hy do people not recognize that his E lus-Cohen were but a transposition, in an ideal world , of the Te mplars of olden tim es, whos e task consisted of protecting the pilg rim s trave ling to the ea rthly Jerusalem , and to defend the Holy City and its Temple ? Our theurgis t, most prob ably im pregnated with e soteric doctrines issuing from the neo-Tem plar centers of Central Europe (W etzlar’s Rose-Croix , the m ystics of Bohem ia-Morav ia, e tc...) was no t unaware o f the Tem plar or igin of this chivalric Order of Saint Andrew which his father had receiv ed, and which he held, and being acquainted with the role played by his an cestors in f orm er tim es in the ref orm ing of the Order of the Temple in Portugal, had, subconsciously , rea lized a m ystical synthesis of a common ideal. This hypothesis is less vague than one m ight suppose. It is quite evident that his most f aithf ul dis ciple, Jean-Bap tiste W iller moz, by substitu ting his “ Cheva iler s Bienfaisants de la Cité Sainte 42 ” for esoteric Templar Masonry , had subconsciously but truly tr ied to perpetu ate th e guiding ideas of his m aster. * * * All this is quite curious, and having rega rd for Truth, we should have the courage to recogn ize it. Joseph d e Mais tre has alrea dy proclaim ed the evidence, the necess ity , the grounds of a point of origin for the whole initia tory “cha in”: “Can we not be usef ul and virtuous without pre decess ors? We are al l united in t he name of Relig ion an d Hu manity . We ca n rep ly th rou gh th e rectitud e of our intentio ns. We t ake h old of (hardiment) the bu ild ing by th e fo un da tions, an d instead of rebu ild ing, we create!” (Cited by E. De rmenghem: “J oseph of Ma istre, Mystic” ). Nevertheless, in parallel with him , drawing from a common source which we have analyzed at length (the Rose-Croix ), there are adepts with the sam e doctrines and the sam e goals, and who, them selves, cam e out of the Strict T emplar Observance ...   “The fourt h, and l ast, C hapter of the “ Brothers R ose-Croix of the Great R osary ”, mad e an assi duous st udy of the particular k now ledge of ont ology, psyc hol ogy and pne um atology : in a w ord, all those part s of sci ence cal led occul t or sec ret , which, being out of t he reach of the multitude, were even forei gn t o ordi nar y e duc ated peo ple., their speci al purpose bei ng the Rehab ilitatio n and Rein tegratio n of Intellig ent Man in to his original rank an d ri ghts. ” 42 Kn igh ts Ben eficen t of th e Holy City – PV. 37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Tem plars & R ose C roix, T ranslated by Pi ers A Va ughan © 2 005 Such was the def initio n of this particula r bran ch of the Rose-Croix c alled th e “ Rite Pr imitif ”, which the Marquis of Chefdebi en knew through his father, him self an initiate, as w ell as his ow n brother in Prague:   “Hi s father had kn ow n s ome Germ an masons, w ith whom he had always main tain ed relatio ns .

This is the fact th at Sweden did not accept the conclusions of the reform at the Convent of W ilhelm sbad, and thus is rem ained aloof, rem aining in the body of the origin al Tem plar Strict O bservance . It follows that this very “Observance: , despite its purifying Convents,was never able to complete ly exc lude Kabbalists, Gnos tics, Theurgists, etc., and that in Sweden, Denm ark, and all the Baltic States, we see this fam ous Northern School existing within it. Contrary to what Matter presum ed, this never had Martinez as its author, but on the contrary, it is m ost probably the pastor Stark , founder the Templar Clericat , whose center was at Mittau , in Courlande. The very nam e indicates a sacerdota l lineage. What priestly line? In his tim e it was though to be from the Jesu its. It is very im probable that the Fathers of this m ost orthodox Company blo ssom ed into doctors of m agic...

(In the 17 th Century Déscartes sought the Rose-Croix there and, accord ing to certain sou rces, found them ...) Indeed, in a letter from the Baron von Durkheim, Minister of the Ducal Court of Saxe-Meinigen, Chapter Comm issaire of the Templar Strict Observa nce Province of Burgundy, under the nam e of “ Equ es ab Arcu ”, and address ed to W iller moz (Librar y of Lyons, m ss. 5481, p.3, 27, cf. Alice joly, op.cit. p, 81), we learn that a Convent had taken place in 177 7, in the m onth of February. Pres ent were the D uke of Brunswick (before - déjà ), the D uke of Saxony, and twenty-four of the m ost i mportant Brothers: “There they decided upon a union bet ween t he Illm inated of Sweden and t he Rectified Rite.” This is s ignif icant. Here, then, we the Kab balis ts, Alc hem ists and Theurgis ts rein tegra ted into this Strict Observance , which had tried in va in to exclude them dur ing the course of the preced ing Convents, sin ce 1741... In another letter, dated Septem ber 10, 1810, written by J.-B. W illerm oz to Prince Charles of Hesse-Cassel, “Viceroy of No rway and Wolstin”, we read another confirm ation of this fact: “Wha t b ecame o f th e fa mou s Illu minated Ch apter of Sweden , w hich had t he W oelners as i ts col umn s, and which, w as f ormed during the epoc h of Wi lhelms bad unde r t he pr otect ion of his He ad, the Most Sere ne Brothe r Charles, Duke of M ecklembur g ( Eque s A S ole Vi vificante bei ng his n ame i n the Orde r), an d t oday upon t he t hrone, w hich h ad suc h high pretensi ons and appe are d to want to dominate i n German y?

Emile Dermengh em: “ The Slee pers ”, Pa ris, 192 6, pa ge 172 ). “I onl y l earned s ome t ime later t hat many of the ( Ger man ) C hapt ers, w hich w ere st rongl y atta ched to their fa vorite system o f th e resto ration of the Temp le, wh ich th e C onvent ha d genui nely rejecte d , demon stra ted th emselves little d isposed to ado pt any ritua ls co ntrary to th is system.” (Cf. E. Derme nghem , op .cit., p. 1 77) . And, after 1810, the tempest of the Revolution and th e wars which followed, passed. Willermoz suspected that the resurgence of the Temple had survived . He was not wrong in this, as we have seen. This Swedish Rite, founded in S weden from 1796 to 1800 by the Prince of Suderm ania, original head of the VII th Province of the Templa r Strict Observance was, in fact, integ rated into th e State, for th e final Degree, “ Vicar of Solomon ”, was occupied by the King of Sweden him self.

In th is Cla ss, degr ees two and th ree cons titu ted the “ Temple Class ”, and an y comm oner adm itted re ceived, ipso facto , personal nobility. J.

For Origen the desert was the world of m atter, abandoned to the Prince of this World, and the preexisting souls fell the re af ter their Fa ll. These sou ls are spiritu ally dead. To revive them , it is necessary for th em to receive the water of Baptism , according to the famous Rosicru cian device : “ Ex Deo nascimur, In Jesu mo rimur, Reviviscimus per Spiritum Sanctum ”, m eaning: “Born in God, dead in Jesus, resuscitated by the Holy Spirit. ” “The Rosy Cross,” Robert Fludd tells us , is the blood of Chri st through which our sins are washed away. It is the Rose of Shar on of the Song of Songs . It is that w hich adorns the secret garden, from its base spring wells of Living W ater. It is th is lov e of Christ by w hich one com es to know, with all the Saints, the length, the height, the depth .” Let us re call that there still exis ted Gnos tics, d isciples of a Platonic Chr istian ity, in Dam ascus in the 12 th Century, and that their works were still ca ref ully copied in the 14 th Century, as witnessed by an Arabic m anus cript in the Na tiona l Libra ry of France. * * * But, outside its highly spiritual signif ican ce, the rose bloom ing at the cen ter of the cross has yet another, m ore concrete m eaning. If alchem y is, to the vulgar “reciter”, onl y a sord id search for m ateria l ric hes, the Royal Art is, for the alchem ist who is truly wort hy of the na me, the probatory experience 73"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Tem plars & R ose C roix, T ranslated by Pi ers A Va ughan © 2 005 of the grounds of the Doctrine; and the achie vement of the “Red Stone” shows him what rem ains for him to do upon himself . This is why Fulcanelli explain s in hi s adm irable “Philosop hical Dwellings” that “ the “S tone ” is the r ed rose, the flower of the crucible .” This latter was also o ften illus trated by a little cro ss in the Middle Ages , which was a play with the Herm etic word on the Provençal crus (hollow) and the Latin crux (cross). W e shoul d not generally forget that, long before Frenc h, Provençal was for centuries the language of the educated, the language of court, and that of essays. There is another im age of the Ros e Croix supplied by the interlacing of the ten sidereal spheres of ancient astrology. This is com prised of a terrestrial sphere, seven planetary spheres, a stellar sphere , and that of the Em pyrean Heaven. * * * For the Rose Croix drawn with the help of four roses bloom ing at the angles of a St. Andrew cross, the symbolism is identical, though expressed differently. Heraldically , this St. An drew cros s is “s altire”. This word has no connection with a necklace 87 . In a tim e then Heraldry was a refined and profound science, held in affection by the “Kings of Ar ms” a nd th eir heralds, it evok ed the idea of long rides on horseback . Indeed, in m edieval tim es, the ‘saltire’ was the tres tle, support for the barrier which the knight had to jum p as a ga llop in his horse in various courtly jousts. As a coat of arm s is both the mem orial of a glorious act and the platform for an ideal life , we can deciphe r the shield, “silver with red cross, qu artered with four roses of the sam e color”, of the Stuarts, counts of Lennox. No t in the original bo ok, but I thou gh t it wo rth in cluding fo r illu stra tive purp oses – PV. “Pink in Herald ry s ignifies nob ility of heart and soul, sweet perfum e of the chivalric life,” says m anuscript 1498 in the Bibliothèque Nationale. But the knight ( chevalier, caballero ...) also has a different signification. The Latin cabalus m eans horse, and th is word evo kes that of cabal. Now, our heraldic   87 Th is ob serv atio n do es no t work in Eng lish .

The four ro ses also ev oke the fou r cardina l virtu es : P rudence, Temperance, Justice and Strength, and the four elem ents (F ire, Air, W ater, Earth ), f rom which the Quintessenc e is re lea sed. In our work “Practical Kabbalah”, w e have given the parallels and general keys of spiritual alchem y with regard to m aterial alchemy. But, outside of heraldry, the cross of St. Andrew has yet another significance. The im age of the Latin lette r ‘x’ is the Herm etic sym bol of Philosophical Fire . This ‘x’ is the universal im age of radiations em anating from a lum inous source. T he sam e letter is also the em blem of the Unknown , and not only in algebra. This ‘x’ is thus the symbol of mystery for the profane and of light (or solution ) for the initia te. In the Greek alphabet, th is sam e cross of St. Andrew becom es the Chi , equivalent to our Latin ‘ k ’. In the realm of material al chemy, it evokes three term s of the Great Work : Koné , Krusos , Kronos , being the Crucib le , Gold and Time 89 ... In the realm of spiritu al alchem y, we find them once more on the labarum of Em peror Constantine, being the chr ismon , where the Chi is allied to th e Greek Rho to evoke, prim e, the nam e of the Savior: Kris tos (derived from Krio : the Anointed ). * * * It seem s that the four letters I.N.R.I. appeared later on, in Rosicrucian symbolism . Either app earing on the cross itself or in the angels in place of the roses, th ey have the sam e occult s ignificance, which recalls the Tetragrammaton of the Old Testament, which is sub stitu ted by that of the New Testam ent.

One knows moreover that it is on the four m yster ious letters that the m yth of the famous “ Lost Wo rd ” is b ased, which is an im ated esoteric ally in th e Ritual of Receptio n in the 18 th Degree of Freem asonry (Knight Rose Croi x). From this ritual we draw the interrogation of the Re cipient, which curiously evokes th e theories of Origen and his distant disciple Martinez de Pasqually on Reintegration: - Who are you? - Ische ...

From wh om did he obtain this right? W e have done research, and questioned those who knew him , notably one of the m embers of the Council . And from what we have been able to learn from that person, Guaita obtained his lineage from English Rosicrucians . And this is why. What follows, we obt ained directly from Augustin Chaboseau (who was a member of the Council of the Rose Croix and a m ember of the Supreme Council of the Martin ist Or der ). Cross-checking the details agains t docum entation belonging to Victor- Em ile Michelet has confirm ed this infor mation to our satisfaction. When Eliphas Lévi went to London, in 1873, he m et English ar istocrats there, who were m embers of an ancient occult frat ernity, strongly focused on the Kabbalah, Pneum atolo gy 97 and Magic. It is while staying w ith one of them that he undertook his famous evoc ation of Apollonius of Tyana, reported in his book “Dogm a & Ritual of High Magic”. These occu ltists were, by uninterrupted lineage, the direct and regular successors of the English Rosicrucians of the 16 th , 17 th and 18 th centu ries . There, Eliphas Lévi rec eive d this eso teric line age in sacram ental f orm . Abbé Lacuria (author of “Har moni es of Being”), rece ived it in his turn f rom Eliphas, af ter the la tter returned f rom France. He passed it to Dr. Adrien Péladan, brother of the fam ous “Sâr”. Dr. Adrien Pélada n gave it to his brother and to Guaita. It is then th at both of them decided to e stab lish the Ordre Kabbalistique de la Rose-Croix . In 1888, Stanislas de Guaita and Joséphi n Péladan, having received ten other members, established the fa mous “ Chambre de Di rection ” which had to consist of twelve members: Stanislas de Guaita, Joséphin Péladan, Gérard Encausse ( Papus ), Mau rice Barrès (who left shortly thereafter because of his rigorou s Catholic b eliefs), Augustin Chaboseau, Paul Adam , Julie n Le jay, Cha rles Ba rlet 98 , Dr. Lalande ( Marc Haven ), Yvon Leloup ( Paul Sédir ), Georges Montières, and Lucien Cham uel. All undertook, a mong other things, to recogni ze the authority of the founder, who in serious situations was invest ed with discre tionary powers, “ the aforesaid founder having proved in an indisputable manner his qua lity and dignity as a Brother of the R ose Croix, etc... ” ( sic ).   97 “Pne um atology refe rs t o the study of spiritual bei ngs a nd phenom ena, es peci ally the interact ions bet ween hum ans a nd God” from ww w.wikipedi a.c om – PV. 98 Nom de pl um e o f Albert Fau cheu x – PV . 77"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Tem plars & R ose C roix, T ranslated by Pi ers A Va ughan © 2 005 Let us take note of this phrase, for it has weight, given that it is based on the word of eleven people. Now, it is a f act that Sta nislas de Guaita and Dr. Gérard Encausse ( Papus ) were, in 1890, received at a sp ecial m eeting of the “ Grand College of R ites of the Grand Orient of France ” with honors reserved for Freem asons of the “ Thirty -Third Degree ”, and this when neither of them were Masons. No minutes of the Grand Orient record this recep tion, which was astonishin g given th at obed ience’s hos tility to Occu ltism . However, the unanim ous witness of senior m embers of the “Cham bre de Direction” of the Order, at this tim e, attested to th is fact. It was not until 1892, on July 5 th , that Stan islas de Guaita was recog nized as “ Director ad vitam ” of the Ordre K abbalistique de la Rose-Croix . A short tim e before the war of 1914-1918, the Rossignol bookstore put on sale (in its Catalog No. 850, page 68) a precio us origin al piece, a m anuscrip t, which was non e other than the contract for the renovation of the Order . Here is the paragraph from that Catalog: “850 – Freemasonry – Act of foundation of the new Ordre Kabbalistique de la Rose-Croix , recognizing Stanislas de Guaita as Director ad vitam . Made in Paris, July 5 th , 1892, on paper, with Masonic insignia(? ...) , and signed by Guaita, Papus, and Charles Berlet 99 , doctors in Kabbalah. Price: 150 francs.” Of these “T welve” m embers, two stil l survive in 1933, Augustin Chaboseau and Lucien Chamuel. The form er was, t oge ther with Paul Ada m and Julien Lejay, “ member of the Chambre de Justice ”. The Ordre Kabbalistique de la Rose-Croix was later constitu ted, th rough the inte rm ediation of its general delegate, Papus , of t he Unive rsity of Hermetic Stud ies , a nd the Independent Group of Esoteric Studies . In 1890 this gave birt h, indirectly, to the Suprem e Council of the Ordre Ma rtiniste . To be adm itte d into the three Rosic rucian grades, at th at tim e it was necessary to pr ove (and it is still a requirem ents nowadays), possession of the quality of possession of the third degree of Martinism : “ S.I. ”. The Order was m eant to be closed at 144 m embers (two tim es 72...). But it never reached this num ber, eith er in Fran ce or abroad. Péladan left the Order in 1890, in order to found a “ Rose Croix Catholique du Temple et du Graal 100 ”, which was short-lived. Nowadays the lin eage com ing from the Ordre Kabbalistique de la Rose-Croix is most definitely not extinct, but it is exc lusive ly res erved to Occultists adhe ring to Esoteric Christianity and the Kabbalah , and through their studie s (Gnosticism , Kabbalah, Theurgy, Mysticism , Astrosophy, Heretics, Alchem y, Spa gyrics, etc...) have brought   99 Sic – s houl d be Barlet – PV . 100 Cath olic R ose Cro ix of t he Tem ple an d Grail” – PV. 78"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Tem plars & R ose C roix, T ranslated by Pi ers A Va ughan © 2 005 their piece of work for Hu man Tra nscendental Knowledge 101 .

Papus was thus doubly in possession of the Rose Croix lineage. He was the only one of the Suprem e Council at that tim e to possess it, in fact, for the one who gave it to him only gave him the functions of a Grand Inspector-General of the Ordre : and (we know this from the latter him self by a letter in our archives), Papus gave it to nobody, not even Teder , who succeeded h im. The one who gave it to him received it hi mself in 1912 in Cairo, during a tour of inspec tion o f Martin ist Chapters in these region s. It is curious to note that it w as also in the M editer ranean East, tha t th e R osicruc ian legend ind icates as b eing the plac e tha t Christian Rozenkreutz was him self also initiated.
