All the full copies of this work I have access to reproduce the plates in black and wh ite; colours in the following are in some instances conjectural restorations, in some instances based on low-resolution images found on the Web, and in a few cases based on the description of the Geheime Figuren in A. E. Waite’s Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross . A comparison of the contents of the AMORC edition with Waite’s account tends to support the editorial claim that it contains all the material from the 1785-1788 publication (I have seen a few references to an undated third part of the original work which has not been translated). The Engelke translation was first issued in 1935 in Chicago; a limited number of copies of this edition were hand-coloured. It was subsequently reprinted, scaled down, in A Christian Rosenkreutz Anthology , from which printing it was in turn pirated by the Masonic publisher Kessinger in the 1990s . A ‘popular edition’ (stapled booklet form, paper covers, uncoloured) was issued by AMORC in 1967 and reprinted in 1987. The Kessinger edition appears to be the only one currently in print. Franz Hartmann’s version of the Secret Symbols ( Cosmology or Universal Science &c. &c. &c. , Boston, 1888) is woefully incomplete and garble d, a travesty rather than a translation. The introductory material from the AMOR C edition (a one-page preface by H. Spencer Lewis, a two-page unsigned forewo rd, probably by the translator, and a two- page bibliographic note) is here omitted. Some doubtful readings on a few plates have been corrected against M.P. Hall’s Codex Rosæ Crucis: D.O.M.A. , which contains a facsimile and translation of an MS. codex of the “D.O.M.A. Text,” from which 20 of the plates in the Geheime Figuren (as well as the long title) derived in whole or part. No attempt has been made to retain paginati on and layout on text sections, which in the print edition of the Engelke translation (fo llowing the first edition) were printed in comparatively small type in two columns.

The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet . ibidem 14 . v . 6 . A scorner seeketh wisdom and findeth it not; but knowled g e is eas y unto him that understandeth. An anonymous Treatise on the Philosopher’s Stone T HE A LMIGHTY , Alone-Wise, and Omniscient GOD and LORD hath given understanding to Man, above all other creatures, so that he may know his works and not leave them unexplored. Now since this Man, whom the All-wise GOD hath inspired therein, hath this high and profound secret Work an d the great secret of the ancient Water-Stone of the Wise , he must needs set himself aright. If ever there is a natural thing on earth, it is the Preparation and the Magysterium of the Philosopher’s Stone, natural and not of man’s making, but wholly the work of Nature, for the Artist addeth nothing thereto. Nature alone directeth the growing, as doth every tiller of the soil with his fruit and plants; only he must be subtle in mind and have the grace of GOD, so that he may direct the same as the work becomes evident in the boiling and through successive time: name ly, in the beginning there is the Subjectum , which one doth receive from Nature directly into the hand. Therein lieth hidden the Universal Tincture of all metals, animal s, and plants. It is a rough Corpus , having neither the figure nor form of an animal or plant, but is in the begi nning a rough, earthy, heavy, viscous, tough and nebulous substance on which Nature hath st opped: but when the enlightened man openeth these matters, investigateth them in Digestion and with its thick foggy shadows with which it is surrounded, he purifieth and permitteth the hidden to emerge, and through further Sublimation its innermost soul, which is hidden therein , is also separated from it and brought into a bodily form. Then one will find what Nature hath hidden in such a once shapeless substance and what power and Magnalia the Supreme Creator hath given to and implanted in this Creato . For GOD have this Creato for all other creatures, as in the the beginning of creation this power was implanted, and He still giveth it da ily, so that it would otherwise not only be impossible for a man to bring such natural work to the desired end, much less to create herein anything useful. But the good and gracious GOD doth not begrudge man the treasures and"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"goods which He hath implanted in Nature, else He would not have granted such things to His creatures: nay, He hath created everything good for man, and hath made him to be Lord over His creation. Therefore it is fitting for man to understand and to undertake such a natural philosophical work, for otherwise such a high ly-gifted and wonderful creation would have been in vain, and we would view Nature like the dumb animals which run about, and we would go vainly after God’s counsel and we could not fit into the ends of Nature. Deus autem et Natura, nihil faciunt frustra (But God and Nature do nothing in vain). But GOD Almighty ruleth in all such things. He ordereth and prov ideth that oats and fodder be placed before the ass and the horse, but that the rational huma n being be served with more costly and more delicious food. Therefore those who try to in vestigate and who long for such a deeply hidden Arcanum and great treasure, in the proper way do not have to depend upon the harvest of the ignorant, who have no understanding under the Light of our Sun. The Philosophers and wise men, as well as Neoterici and Veteres , have had many disputations about this secret art, and have tried to point out, with many different names, allegories, and wondrously strange sophistical words what that Subjectum and its Essentia are, and what kind of a Materia , what kind of a Corpus , what kind of a Subjectum , and what a wonderful thing and secret a Creatura it is, which hath embodied such mighty, strange, and heavenly powers, and with which, after digestion and purification, one can help human beings, animals, plants, and metals, and one can bring their health and perfection up to the highest degree, and one can also do many other marvellous things with it. Nevertheless all those who were and still are true Philosophi , have unanimously pointed out one single Scopum and one only Materium , the Filii Sapientiat . writing various and manifold speeches and scripts about it concerning the essential thing, however, there is only silence. and that silence hath fast-locked their mouths, and placed a solid Sigill upon them, for if it should become as common knowledge as brewing and baking, the world would soon perish. There are many who have searched for that only Res. which solvit se ipsum , coagulat se ipsum , se impsum impraegnat , mortificat et vivicat (dissolveth itself, coagulateth itself, impregnateth itself, killeth and bringeth to life ag ain), but most of these searchers, who have lost themselves while searching, failed. Then it is such a thing as is nearest gold; and it is such a thing as the poor as well as the rich can gain, be it whatever it may. But it threateneth the Philosophi execrationem divinam , and invoketh the curse of God upon him who with his own mouth might expressly speak on this Subjectum . When the Philosophers pronounced an Execration Almighty God did respect and grant their appear, and gave unto them what He had until then kept in His own hands for several thousand years. Now the aforesaid Sujectum is of such a nature that it, our Magnesia , doth not only contain a small proportioned quantity of the universal Spiritus Vitalis in itself, but also hath some of the heavenly power condensed an d compassed within it. Many who found it were so intoxicated by its fumes that they rema ined in their place and could no longer raise themselves. Only a wise man and one who knoweth these things can take a measure of this same fluid and carry it home from whatever place he may have found it, be it from the depths of the mountains or any other place where it may be met. The poor and the rich are quite free, by the singular and abouding grace of God, to take this, so that he go eth homeward with it to his house, and placeth it behind the furnace or in any other room where it pleaseth him, and where it is convenient for him, and he may begi n to work and to experiment with it, for he can leave off so quickly that even his own servants do not notice it. For it doth not go so slovenly with this natural work as it does with the co mmon alchemists with their bungling work, with their charcoal-burning, smelting and refining, and whatever more they may do. But it is a work which one can keep in a closed casket in whatever room he wisheth, alone that not even a cat come upon it, and, should it be necessary, he can well carry on his craft, only taking care that the furnace have a threefold testing, and that he keep it at the right heat, and let Nature take its own course, so when finally the Solution is taken out of the Terrestriaet , and is strengthened by long Digestion , it is set free from the Crudæ Materiæ , and is prepared and reborn in the most subtle form. Subsequently, of course, this sharp and potent Spiritus is at certain times given a well-measured quantity , after the fashion of drinking and nourishing, per modum inbibitionis et nutritionis . And its potency is thus con densed and daily become as new supports for its brethren, and active therein. Dost thou indeed think that one can bring forth"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"such work and such potency in unmeasured hidden intensity, a Spiritus Vitalis ? The crudæ Materiæ or Subjectum cometh from the Astris and Constellation of the heavens into its earthly kingdom, from which is then drawn the spiritus universi secretur of the Philosophers, which is the Mercurius of the Wise, and it is the beginning, the means, and the end, in which the Aurum Physicum is determined and hidden, which the commo n alchemist things to extract out of common gold, but in vain. Meanwhile the Philosophi deal much in their writings with Sol and Luna , which of all metals are the most durable in the D . But this is not to be understood literally, for their Sol and Luna , when they are brought totheir inner puritæt , through true, natural, seemly, and philosophical præparation may well be compared with the celestial bodies, such as the Sun and the Moon, which with their brightness illuminate day and night, the upper and the lower Firmament . Therefore these two noble metals, like the Sol and Luna of the Philosophers, resemble by nature the human body, and to him who knoweth how to prepare them rightly and use them wisely they gi ve much health, and except and above this nothing else is to be prepared, but the one three-fold point of the Universalis , for the Spiritus to be found in these two said things produceth co nsistency, strength and virtue, amongst other things. Now the man pardoned by God can prepare and make ready an object or abundance of the above mentioned red or white, of Sol and Luna , which is called the Lapidem Philosophroum , or the very ancient Water-Stone of the Wise , from the substance in which God placed such potency at the creation or genesis of the world, or the oft-mentioned materials or Subjectum which God, out of love and grave, implanted in the highly-endowed divine man. But I believe, therefore, that the divine substanc e which was left to him in the firs Creation of the world, of the Spiritu Vitali , of the Inspiration , hath survived in all kinds of creatures. All received the same Spiritum in the aforesaid Massam , and firmly secluded in the lowest depths of the earth, and it was indicated and left to the Wise Men to disinter it, to extract it, to use it, and to perform the same Miracula with it, through the holy wisdom which is still implanted in it and with which it is supplied daily. Both substances mentioned above as Sun and Moon or red and white, or rather the Præparation $ is and Mercurii , are the ingredients in the Composition of our Lapidis Philosophorum . Now then the Materia are in the beginning through sufficient and oft-repeated Sublimentiones purified and cleansed, and then weigh ed carefully, and then soon composed; also thou must not be ignorant of what is the potency and occasion of both the said ingredients, but thou must know how to arrange both Pondera, secundum proportionem Physicam (according to the analogy of Physics), for a good portion of the # ii is encumbered with a small portion of animæ Solis vel Sulphuris , and then unite both with a delicate hand, so that finally the Præparation and the most difficult work is completed. But thou wilt have to know that thou must first tinge thy # um with the red Tinctur , yet it will not become red in continenti , but remaineth white, for the Mercurius hath the privilege of wanting to be tinged first before all others. The Philosophi also tell what to do in addition with the Anima solis of this Tinctur of the Mercurii , and from whence it shall be taken. The Ferment of gold is gold, just as the Ferment of dough is dough. Moreover, it is the Ferment of gold out of its own nature, and then its potency is perfect when it is transformed back into earth. And then this is first the beginning of the Philosophers, the right and true Prima Materia Philosophorum metallorum (the first Materia of the metals of the Philosophers ). From then on the true Masters, experienced in the Art, begin to stimulate their Ingeniam and attain to the Great Work. And then the Artifex continues further with such work and, through God’s blessing, bringeth it to the end, to which it tendeth and where it is embodied by God, namely, to the highly-blessed Philosopher’s Stone. So that from nothing else than per Spiritum universali Secretum the true materia prima Philosophorum is prepared and made ready. Who now understandeth well this Spritum Secretum understandeth also, without doubt, the secrets and wonders of Nature and hath the perception of the light of Nature. For he is motus harmonicus Sympaticus and magneticus , from which originates the Harmonia and Concordantia , the magnetic and sympathetic power or effect of the upperm ost and of the lowermost. But note that the natures of both ingredients are unlike each other in the beginning because of their opposed qualities. For one is warm and dry, the other is cold and moist, and they must of course be"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"united. But when this is about to occur, then their opposed qualities must slowly be changed and equalised, so that neither nature through intens e fire divest the other of its potency. For thou canst never collect them, because both nature s must rise simultaneously in the fire’s power. Then the Discrasia will be taken from the Corpori , and an Æqualitatis and good Temperatur is established, which occureth through a moderate and constant boiling. For when both of the natures Sulphur and Mercurius are enclosed in a very narrow space and are maintained with moderate heat, they begin to abate from their opposed character and to unite, until finally they have a ll the qualities. They become one Conspiration and rise at the same time, and certainly at the top of the glass standeth numero one. They are ready to wed, and then the bridegroom placeth a golden ring on his bride, say the Philosophi . And when thus the Mercurius is with its Sulphur , like water and earth with each other, become duly boiled (and the longer the more) they cast away all their superfluities and the pure parts join each other and dispose of their corlicibi ; otherwise the impure parts prevent unification and the Ingress . For the Mercurius , as the first Corpus , is entirely crude and can per anima be neither mixed nor perpetuated, for neither Corpus entereth the other nor w ill be united with it either vere or in radice . But should these things be so helped that a true Tinctur will be formed, there must be prepared out of this a new spiritual Corpus which cometh forth out of both, for after the purification one taketh the virtues of the other, and out of several become one, numero et virtute (in number and power). But if the fire sh ould be much too intense and should not be controlled according to the requirements of Nature, these two above-mentioned would be either suffocated or separated. If they did no t have their right mode of preparation, they would become either nothing or a spoiled work and a Monstrum . But when one proceedeth prudently and with a duly tempered heat, then both substances will rise in the Sublimation uppermost in the glass or cupola. Then when thou pluckest these lovely flowers, thou canst enjoy them already particularia . But thou canst observe the motum occultum naturæ as little as thou canst either hear or see the grass growing, for one can neither observ e nor notice the increase and development of these two ingredients, Mercurri and Sulphuris , because of their subtle, hidden, and slow Progressus from hour to hour. Only by marks set fro m week to week can it be observed and a conclusion drawn, for the inner fire is very delic ate and subtle. But however slow it may be, it doth not stand still until it cometh to the end where its intent is to be seen, as in all plants, unless it then be that such subtle and expert bo iling is hindered through the all too-strong heat of the sun and is burnt out, or is hindered through suddenly appearing cold: ergo qui scit occultum motum naturæ, scit perfectum decoctionem (therefore he who knoweth the hidden movement of Nature, knoweth also the pe rfect boiling or preparation). This motum should now take its natural and self-determined course , although one can neither hear nor see it, as also one cannot comprehend the Centra et ignem invisibilem seminum invisibilium (the Centre and invisible fire of the invisible seed). Therefore thou must commit such a matter to Nature alone, and observe it and not once try to oppose Nature, but have all confidence in it until it bringeth forth its fruit. When one treateth Nature with a gentle and agreeable heat, it doeth and effecteth everything out of itself, which for the furnishing of a Creati or the introduction of a new form is a matter of necessity, for the Divine Word Fiat still abideth in all creatures and in all plants, and hath its mighty power in these times as well is in the beginning. There are, however, four chief Virtutes and potentias of which noble Nature maketh use in every boiling; thereby it doth complete its work and bringeth it to an end. The first Virtus Is and is called appellativa et attractiva , for it is possible for it to attrtact to itself from far or near, food of which it is desirous out of results and places agreeable to its nature, and it can grow and increase. And here it hath a magnetic power, like that of a man for a woman, the Mercurius for the Sulphur , the dry for the moist, the Materia for the form. Therefore the axiom of the Philosophers is: natura naturam amat, amplecitur pr osequitur. Omnia namquam crescentia, dum radices agunt et vivant, succum ex Terra a ttrahunt, atque avide arripiunt illud, quo vivere et augmentari sentiunt — i.e. , Nature loveth nature, surroundeth it , and followeth it. For all plants,"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"when they strike root and begin to live, suck sap out of the earth, and draw to themselves avidly that whereby they sense they can live an d multiply themselves. For where there is hunger and thirst, food and drink will be received with avidity and this Virtus and potentia will be aroused, and it cometh from the heat and average dryness. The Second Virtus and Potentia Is and is called natura retentiva et coagulativa . For Nature not only alone is useful to it and serveth it for its continuation and is advantage ous when it lacketh that which it eagerly pro- duceth from itself, but hath also with it the bond with which it draweth and bringeth and holdeth it to itself. Yea, Nature even changeth it into itself, for as it hath chosen of these two the purest parts, it separateth the rest and brin geth to the mouth and maketh it grow, and is in no need of any other calcination or fixation; natura naturam continet (Nature retaineth nature), and such skill cometh from its dryness, for the cold constricteth the gained and evenly-formed parts and drieth them in the Terræ . The Third Virtus and Potentia naturæ in rebus generandis et augmentandis Est Virtus digestiva, quæ fit per pu trefactionem seu in putrefactione (is the digestive power, which occurs trhough the putrefaction or in the putrefaction), in moderate and temperate heat and moisture. For Nature directeth, changeth, and introduceth one kind and quality, the crudeness is done away with, the bitter is ma de sweet, the harsh is made mild, the rough is made smooth, the immature and wild is made tame, that which was formerly incapable is now made skillful and efficient, and leadeth to the final intended execution and perfection of the Work, and representeth the Ingredientia to the Composition . The Fourth Potentia naturæ Est virtus expulsiva mundificativa, segregativa (the expelling, purifying, separating power) which separateth and divideth, which purifieth and cleanseth, which washeth during the Sublimation or Decoction . It setteth from Sordibus and darkness and bringeth forth a pure, transparent, powerful or illuminated Corpus or substance; it collecteth the Partes homogeneis , and is gradually set free from the heterogeneis , repulseth the Vitia and everything alien, inspecteth the crude, and giveth every part a special place. Th is is caused by and cometh from the agreeable constant heat in appropriate moisture, and that is the Sublimation and mature fruit, which will now fall out of the husk. Therefore it is in the beginning designed by Nature and artisans, namely the Patiens is set free from the Agente , and will be perfected. Nam liberatio illa a partibus heterogeneis est vita et perfectio omnis Rei .— i.e. for the liberation of those unequal and opposed parts is the life and perfection of all things. For the Agens and Patiens which until now have been contending with each other, so that each a ffecteth and rendereth resistance according to its opponent’s resistance— i.e. as much as possible it would like to break its opponent’s resistance and they must not unite during the time of the Decoction , but the best part must gain the victory and expell the impure, and subjugate it. Now when all Naturalis potentia have done their officium , then cometh forth the new birth and as the mature fruit presenteth itself in all other plants, so also now in our Subjecto and natural work which, when perfected, quite surpri singly doth not at all resemble any more its first beginning and hath no more quality, and is neither cold nor dry, neither moist nor warm, and is neither masculus nor fœmina . For cold is there itself turned into heat, and the dry into the moist, the heavy into the light, for it is a new Quinta Essentia , a Corpus Spirituale , and hath become a Spiritus corporalis , such a Corpus as is clear and pure, tran sparent and crystalike: one which Nature itself, could never have produced as long as the world hath stood. The Artifex and the enlightened man, however, auxiliante Deo et natura (by the aid of God and Nature), produceth through his intellect and art, and he placeth it there by itself. So that subsequently he encountereth a Miracula and that is called: Unguentum anima, aurum Philosophorum, flos auri (the unguent, the soul, the philosohpers’ gold, the flower of gold). Theophrastus and others call it Gluten aquilæ . Now what is shown about the four potentiis naturæ , the same had been effected by means of the fire, which must be incombustible, pleasin g to Nature, and according to Nature it must"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"continue steadily and must also be advantageou s to the Work: but in this Work two kinds of fires are to be particularly well attended to, namely: the outer elementary fire which the Artifex constructeth and which he applieth to the Wo rk, and after that the inner, innate, and natural fire of the substances. Though in a ll three primary things or genera there is to be found a natural fire as in the Animalibus , Vegetabilibus , and Mineralibus , through which it started and moved, maintained life, was stre ngthened and increased; and can continue its innate power of bringing forth and of implanted virtue according to the character of each. But the fire which is in our Subjecto is in itself not least amongst creatures and minerals. It hath hidden within itself the most wonderful, the most potent fire against which the outer fire seemeth like water, for no common eleme ntary fire can consume and destroy the pure gold which is the most durable substance amongs t all metals, however intense the fire may be, but the essential B and C of the Philosophers alone doeth it. If we had to-day that fire with which Moses burned the golden calf and ground it to powder and strewed it upon the water and which he gave to and made the Children of Israel drink of it ( Exodus , ch. 32)—let such be a piece of alchemical work of Moses, the man of God! For he was instructed in the Egyptian art and skilled therein. Or the fire which the prophet Jeremias hid beneath the foot of the mountain, from which Moses saw the Promised Land and whereon he died, the fire which was recover ed seventy years later by the Wise Men, the descendents of the old priests after the return from the Babylonian Captivity. But in the meantime the fire was changed in the mountain and became dense water (II Maccab . ch. 1 and 2). What thinkest thou? should we not warm ou rselves at it and keep from us the frost in winter? Such fire slumbereth in our Subjecto quietly and peacefully and hath no movement of itself. Should now this secret and hidden fire help its own Corpori , so that it may rise and have its effect, and manifest its might and power, so that the Artist may reach the desired and predestined end, it must be aroused through the outer elementary fire, be kindled and be brought into its course. This fire may be in lamps, or of whatever kind thou dost like, or contrive, for it alone is sufficiently capable of executing the activity with ease, and such fire and outer heat must be tended and mainta ined all the time until the end of the Sublimation , so that the inner and essential fire be kept alive, in order that the two indicated fires may help each other and the outer fire let the inner fire be worthy, until in its appointed time it becometh so strong and intense a fire that it will s oon burn to ashes, pulverise, turn into itself, and make equal to itself all that is put into it but which is neverthele ss of its own kind and nature. Nevertheless it is necessary for every Artifex , and the cost of his desired end, to know that between these two above-mentioned fires, he maintaineth certain proportions between the outermost and the innermost, and that he kind le his fire rightly, for if he maketh it too weak, then the Work cometh to a standstill, and the outermost fire is not able to raise the inner one, and in so far as he stirreth it up moderately several times it yieldeth a slow effect and a very long process, and when he hath waited with such patience and hat his data, he then finally reacheth his intended goal. But if one ma keth a stronger fire than befitteth this process, and it be speeded up, then the inner fire suffereth, it is entirely incapable, the Work will surely be destroyed, and the hasty one will never attain his end. If after lasting Decoction and Sublimation the noble and pure parts of the Subjecti are gradually, with the advantage of a calculat ed time, separated and set free from the crude earthly and useless substance, the impulse in su ch activity must be according to Nature and must be adjusted with such moderation that it will be agreeable, pleasing, and advantageous to the inner fire, in order that the inner essenti al fire be not destroyed through all too-intense heat, or even extinguished and made useless. Na y, rather it will be maintained in its natural degree, be strengthened, while the pure and subtle parts come together and convene, the crude being separated, so that they combine and the best will achieve the aforesaid end in view. Therefore thou must learn from Nature tha t degree of fire which Nature useth in its operations until it bringeth its fruit to maturity, and from this learn Reason and make calculation. For the inner essential fire is really that which bringeth the Mercurium Philosophorum to æqualitæt; but the outer fire stretcheth forth to it a hand so that the inner fire will not be hindered in its operation, therefore the outer must have concordance with the"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"inner and must adjust itself according to the same, vice versa . Then in such use of the universal elementary fire it must be led toward the i nner natural heat, and the outer heat hath to be adjusted to it, so that such doth not surpass in the Creato the power of the moist and warm Spiritus , which is wholly subtil; if otherwise, the warm nature of the said Spiritus would soon be dissolved, and it could not hold itself together any more, and would have no potency; it followeth therefrom that a fire more intense that is necessary for reviving and maintaining the inner natural fire implanted in our Materiæ can only be for hindrance and deterioration. In natura et illius Creatis et generationibus sit tua Imaginatio ,— i.e. , upon Nature and what hath been created or brought forth by her, mediate thou. Therefore bring the moist Spiritum into the earth, make it dry, agglutinirs and figurs , with an agreeable fire. Thus shalt thou also bring the Animan into the dead Corpus and restore what thou hast taken away, and thou restorest the soulless and dead to life and to rise again and be equipped, but whatever hath driven it will not stand the heat, for it will not become constant as if it were to be received spontaneously from itself with a good will, with joy and with desire, and be deeply impressed. And that is sicci cum humido naturalis unio et ligamentum optimum (the natural unification of the dry with the moist and also the best tie) . Yea, if one really desireth to discuss this matter: the Wise Men mention three kinds of fire, each of which taketh charge of the operis magni , so that each best form in particular must in wisdom and good readiness have governed this also. And so he will not work as one blind, but in an understanding and prudent manner, as befitteth an intelligent Philosophus . The first is the outer fire, which the Artist or watchman maketh, which the Wise Men call ignem frontem , upon which Regimen dependeth the safety or the ru in of the entire Work, and this in two ways: nemium fumiget cave (take heed that it doth not smoke too much), but it is also said: combure igne fortissimo (burn it with the strongest fire). The second fire is the nest wherein the Phœnix of the Philosophers hath its abode, and hatcheth itself therein ad regenerationem . This is nothing else than the Vas Philosophorum . The Wise Men call it ignem corticum , for it is written that the Phœnix bird collected all fragrent wood whereon it cremateth itself. If this were not so, the Phœnix would freeze to death and it could not attain to its Perfection . Sulphura Sulphuribus continentur (Sulphurs are maintained by sulphurs). For the next should protect, assist, ch erish and keep the brood of the bird unto the final end. The third however is the true innate fire of the noble Sulphuria , itself to be found in radice subjecti , and is an Ingredient , and it quieteth the Mercurium and fashioneth it; that is the real Master, yea, the true Sigillum Hermetis . Concerning this fire Crebrerus writeth: In profundo mercurii est Sulphur, quod tandem vincit frigiditatem et humiditatem in mercurio . Hoc nihil aliud est, quam parvus ignis occultus in mercurio, quod in mineris nostris exitatur et longo temporis successe digerit frigiditatem et humiditatem in mercurio ,— i.e. , In the essence of the Mercurii is a sulphur which finally conquereth the coldness and the moisture in the Mercurio . This is nothing else than a small fire hidden in the Mercurio , which is arounsed in our Mineris , and in the fulness of time it absorbeth the coldness and moisture in the Mercurio or removeth them, and that is also said about the fire.

Make known to thee the Terra Sancta, so that thou mayest go not astray. Where on this globe lives a man so wise, Who'll ever learn what four ones do comprise, And even if he'd know all this, He'd still always be an apprentice. Therefore, O human, with all thy might, Recognise God and thyself in God's and nature's light Both these light God pours into thee, That a likeness of him thou mayest be, He is one fourfold God, let thou be told, As thou art a piece of clay fourfold. This maketh nature to thee well known, With wisdom, light and understanding to thee is it shown To nothing can thine eye be blind, Be it of body or of mind. Therefore be thankful to thy God, Who in time this before thee hast brought Be thou not jealous of the scoffer's fame, Do not begrudge every mocker's great name. With sophistical vanity they strut, Unbeknownest to them is what thou'st got. Be happy with what God to thee gave, Defy, that four in one they have.

And that the human being has all these things in his heart: heav en and hell, light and darkness, life and death."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" THERE IS ONE TREE bearin g two kinds of fruits. Its name is the tree of the knowled g e of g ood and evil. Like its name, are its fruits: namel y , g ood and bad fruits of life and death, of love and hate, of li g ht and darkness. This tree was put before Adam, and even if he had in his inno- cence the libert y to look upon it as a tree of God’s won- ders God’s pro- hibition did not allow him to place his desire in it and eat of it, but threat- ened that (if he would do so) he would die from its fruit. For this was a tree of division where g ood and evil battled with each other: but in a battle there can be no life. For battle brin g s forth destruction, and de- struction brin g s forth death, life lives in the sweet unity of love. Therefore when Adam ate from this tree, a battle started within him, and in this battle he lost his life. The Tree of Good and Evil Knowledge N e v e r t h e – less wretched men will not learn through such fall and damage. His desire is still for that tree and its fruits. Man is al- ways desirous to have the division of manifold things, and man is always battling, when he could return to the unity of simplicity, if only he would come in peace. Life’s light stands in the middle to point out to men the way to this first rest, and the Father in the heavens lets his Sun rise over good and evil. But everything grows after its own fashion, and man is only too apt to look upon the stars of the many-foldness, and in his own dis- cretion, to choose them for his ladders, though they make him stray many times from the true light, and detain him in the whirlpool of uncertainty. This whilpool of uncer- tainty leads more and more out of the innermost face of the Sun into the outer (world) and can find neither end nor place of rest, unless it leads from the outer (world) back gain and seeks the beginning, from which all the smaller star-lights originated. There is also among 7 stars hardly one turning its rays inward to direct the searching mind to Bethlehem, and amongst 7 eyes widing around the whirldpool of searching desire is hardly one which stands towards the Sabbath in the innermost: but the restless movement of the working days move them through all spheres, and even if they take a look at God’s wonders, they only l ook upon the surface and every eye looks upon that which is shown through its own desire. God made man to live in an eternal Sabbath, he should not work, but let God work in him, he should not take with his own hands, but only receive what God bestowed plentifully upon His mercy. But man left the Sabbath, and wanted to work himself, raised his hand against the law to take in his own desire what he should not have taken. Therefore, God let him fall, and since he had despised the quiet, he had to feel painfully the restlessness. In such restlessness of life all children of men still extend their hands, trying to grasp their pleasures. And as is their unde rstanding and will, so is their grasping. Some grasp for the good, some grasp for the evil. Some grasp for the fruit, some only for the leaves, some for a branch with fruits and leaves on it. And they derive pleasure from the things they have grasped, these poor fools do not know that all their pain and labor had only been a Studium particulare . They grasp for pieces, where they could obtain the whole. They seek for quiet and cannot find it; for they look from the outside into the restlessness of movement, which dwells in the inner solitude of the inner Centri and though one may grasp more than the other, it is still piece-work. At times there may be one amongst 7 hands coming near the secret and it grasps the whole stem of the tree at that point where all the divided branches return to unity. But even this hand is still far from the roots of the tree, only grasping and holding the secret from the outside and cannot yet see it from the inside. For the root of this tree is understood only by the eye of wisdom, standing in the Centro of all spheres. These roots go from the visible world of mingled good and evil, into the sphere of the invisible world. This eye looks with the greated peace upon the wonders of all movements and also looks through all the other eyes, wandering about outside of the rest of the unrest, all those eyes which want to see for themselves without the right ey e of wisdom, from which they have received their seeing-power. This eye can prove all spriits, how intelligent, pure and acute they be. It understands the sources of good and evil. Plain before it is light and darkness. It understands time and eternity, visible and in- visible, present and future thin gs, earthly and heavenly things, things of the body and things of the spirit, high and deep, out- wardliness and inwardliness. And nevertheless, none of these things are disturbed by it, for the eye lives in the Centro of peace, where everything stands in equality outside of any strife, and whatever it sees it possesses. For in the Ceentro of its peace is its kingly throne, everything being subject to it. Therefore, dear man! If thou wouldst return to right understanding and right peace, cease from thy works and let God alone work in thee, so that the eye of wisdom will open in thine own self and thou wilt attain a studio particulari ad universale and One find All."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, saith the Lord.

MONS PHILOSOPHORUM The soul of man everywhere was lost through a fall, and the health of the body suffered through a fall. Salvation came to the human soul through IEHOVA, Jesus Christ. The bodily health is brought back through a thing not good to look at. It is hidden in this painting, the highest treasure in this world, in which is the highest medicine and the greatest pa rt of the riches of nature, given to us by the Lord IEHOVA. It is called Pater Metallorum , well known to the philosopher sitting in front of the mountain-cave, easy to obtain for anybody.

To the left one can see freely what the right Clavis artis is: one cnnot be too subtle with it, like a hen hatching a chicken. In the midst of the mountain, before the door stands a co urageous Lion in all its pride, whose noble blood the monster-dragon is going to shed; throwing him into a deep grave, out of it comes forth a black raven, then called Ianua artis , out of that comes Aquilo alba .

God hath caused all men to be born again out of love and hath already enkindled the light within them in their Mother's womb, and He Himself is the light, the morning star, shining from within them Jesus Christ yesterday, today and in eternity.

God is threefold, the Word is threefold and 2 times 3 is 6, pertaining to the inner-most person and morning-star within our heart, which is Jesus Christ, the one point. This figure explains the 1. Epistle of John, and the same explains this figure. A heart is wide at the top, narrow at the bottom, to be opened to God, closed to earthliness. The starry heaven in the heart with its powers and might is subject to vanity, and time being past, the everything will be again in eternity. Picture of the Human Heart in the Old and the New Creature The old birth of death in darkness must be slain through cross and suffering, in a wide circle is the reason captured and through the Word, man is being led back into the spirit, into the rebirth, into the light, in Christo, where alone there is quiet, peace, eternal life and the kingdom of heaven. No. 1. Here is Christus born a man according to the flesh of Maria, about this He said in John 6. The flesh pacif- ieth nothing. Here is the human birth from Adam, the old Creature, sinful, mortal, does not come into the heavenly kingdom, man liveth in darkness, blindness, night and death, in his reason from the power of the stars and the 4 Elements, out of which come sickness, out of which are invented the handling of the arts, higher schools, ecclesiastical and secular officers and position, so far they are in the heart. Over which rules the authority which God ordered. All this is in vain and mortal, into this darkness shineth the light and the darkness comprehendeth it not. Herein belong Chrstians, Jews, Turks and heathens, they are altogether sin- ners and lack the glory they ought to have before God, they are all resolved in God's wrath. No. 2. Here Christus is grived in his soul and tempted by the devil, the innermost conscience out of the stars is being tempted by lust of the eyes, deed of the flesh and of vanity, with assurance and despair. Here the Holy Scriptures become dead letters, bringing forth sects, superstitions and fleshy priests, fearing God's word might be taken away from them, meaning the dead letter. The authorities want to fight with the sword for religion, killing the believers, Christ and His apostles, thinking to serve God, divine things are just so much foolishness to them, they can understand Christ only in the flesh and according to the tribe of David, they make divisions, cliques and sects. No. 3. Here is the separation of light from darkness, the dawn comes up, all temporalities will be forsaken, through many sorrows we have to enter into the kingdom of God, man is a fool to the world, Christ is being cruci- fied in him and he is Christ, therefore he is a cross to the world and the world a cross to him, here stands calmness, whoever turneth towards the light lives in Christ and Christ in him in time and eternity. No. 4. The old hath to go entirely: for behold: I make all things new. Here is the rebirth by water and spirit, from on high through the word of truth, a new creature born of God. Christ hath become flesh, resurrected in the human being, awakening him from the dead, nourishing him with his real flesh and blood unto life. Christ is the word of the father, the book of life, the Gospel, the power of God. He causeth belief, and He blesseth. He is king, ruling with the sword of the spirit, man becometh divine nature, hath his life in heaven with Christ. No. 5. The Holy Ghost is the ointment, teacheth men innermost Divine things; man hath become a temple of God, indwelt by the Holy Trinity. Christ in man, God and man, bringing about love. Christus is all in all, the sole One. O LORD , merciful GOD , open the human heart, to understand Th y secrets through the Holy Ghost Who hath well understood the figure, Hath understanding, also , of the scriptures.

Thus the splendour of the whole world will be thine, and all darkness shall flee from thee. This is the strongest of all powers, the Force of all forces, for it overcometh all subtle things and can penetrate all that is sold. For thus was the world created, and rare combinations, and wonders of many kinds are wrought. Hence I am called HERMES TRISMEGISTUS, having mastered the three parts of the wisdom of the whole world. What I have to say about the masterpiece of the alchemical art, the Solar Work, is now ended."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"INTERPRETATION and EXPLANATION of the TABULA SMARAGDINA HERMETIS This picture, plain and insignificant in appearance, Concealeth a great and important thing Yea, it containeth a secret of the kind That is the greatest treasure in the world. For what on this earth is deemed more excellent Than to be a Lord who ever reeketh with gold, And hath also a healthy body, Fresh and hale all his life long. Until the predestined time That cannot be overstepped by any creature. All this, as I have stated, clearly Is contained within this figure. The separate shields are to be seen, And on them are eagle, lion, and free star. And painted in their very midst Arfully stands an imperial globe. Heaven and Earth in like manner Are also placed herein intentionally, And between the hands outstretched towards each other Are to be seen the symbols of metals And in the circle surround the picture Seven words are to be found inscribed. Therefore I shall now tell What each meaneth particularly And then indicate without hesitation How it is called by name. Therein is a secret thing of the Wise In which is to be found great power. And how to prepare it will also Be described in the following: The three shields together indicate Sal , Sulphur , and Mercium . The Sal hath been one Corpus that Is the very last one in the Art. The Sulphur henceforth is the soul Without which the body can do nothing Mercurius is the spirit of power, Holding together both body and soul, Therefore it is called a medium Since whatever is made without it hath no stability. For soul and body could not die Should spirit also be with them. And soul and spirit could not be Unless they had a body to dwell in, And no power had body or spirit If the soul did not accompany them. This is the meaning of the Art: The body giveth form and constancy, The soul doth dye and tinge it, The spirit maketh it fluid and penetrateth it. And therefore the Art cannot be In one of these three things alone Nor can the greatest secret exist alone: It must have body, soul, and spirit. And now what is the fourth, From which the three originate The same names teach thee And the sevenfold star in the lower shield"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The Lion likewise by its colour and power Showeth its nature and its property. In the Eagle yellow and white are manifest. Mark my words well, for there is need of care; The imperial orb doth exhibit The symbol of this highest good.

And as soon as the gates are closed One cannot enter any city. And if they had no gates Not one thing could they accomplish. But if these gates are close together A ray of light appeareth from seven colours. Shining very brightly together Their might is incomparable. Thou canst not find such wonders on earth, Wherefore hearken unto further particulars: Seven letters, and seven words, Seven cities, and seven gates, Seven times, and seven metals, Seven days, and seven ciphers Whereby I mean seven herbs Also seven arts and seven stones.

A moistened dust, a fuller wind doth raise Wherein are all qualities."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"If thou dost not understand this, Then I may not name it for thee otherwise. Now I will instruct thee How it should be prepared. There are seven ways for this art, If thou neglectest any of them thou workest in vain. But thou must, before all things else, know Thou hast to succeed in purification. And although this be twofold, Thou art in need of one alone. The first work is freely done by it Without any other addition, Without distilling something in it Simply through its putrefication. From all of its earthliness Is everything afterwards prepared. This first way hath two paths, Happy is he who goeth on the right path. The first extendeth through the strength of fire, With and in itself, note this well. The second extendeth further Until one cometh to treasure and to gain. This is done by dissolving, And again by saturating, I inform you: This must be undertaken first of all, So comest thou to the end of the fine art. After the whole purification hath been completed It will be prepared and boiled in the sun Or in the warm dung of its time Which extendeth itself very far Until it become constant and perfect, And the treasure of the Wise is in it. The other ways are very subtle And many mighty ones fail therein, For here is the purpose of the distillation And the sublimation of the Wise Men. The separation of the four elements Is also called by the Wise Men Air, water, and rectified fire. The earth on the ground hath misled many, Having been deemed a worthless thing, Although all the power lieth in it. Some know not how to separate it From their Cortibus , therefore they fail. It was cast behind the door, But the Wise Man taketh it up again, Purifieth it snow-white and clear: This is the ground, I say in truth. But if thou dost wish to separate it, Note that it is of no little importance, For if they are not prepared Then you are in error, that I swear. Therefore thou must also have some vinegar Which is revealed to the Wise Men, Wherewith thou wilt effect the separation, So that nothing earthly remaineth in it any more, Till body and soul have to be separated Otherwise called fire and earth And after that they are thus purified. ) ) ) And thereupon followeth the mixture, observe! And so it cometh to a wondrous strength, The finished figures with the unfinished. And if the fire be likewise rightly controlled,"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"It will be entirely perfect In much less time than a year. Now thou hast the entire way in its length On which are not more than two paths. From these one soon wandereth and goeth astray, Else it all standeth clear and plain. The one is the water of the Wise Men, Which is the Mercurius alone. The other is called a vinegar, And it is known only to a very few. And this vinegar doth circle Away from the philosophical iron. It is Lord Aes whom it maketh glad. Therefore they have combined so closely Many hundred forms and names are given After each hath chosen it. One way springeth from the true source, A few have worked on it for a whole year. But many through their art and craft Have shortened so long a space of time. And quickly is the preparation set free As Alchemy doth point out. The preparation alone Maketh this stone great and glorious. Although there is but one matter It lacketh nothing else. But when it is clarified Its name hath misled many. However, I have revealed enough to thee In many ways, forms, and fashions. There are many names; I say Let not thyself be misled from the true way. In their scriptures, the Elders write That it is a draught, a great poison. Others call it a snake, a monster, Which is not costly anywhere It is common to all men Throughout the world, to rich and also to poor. It is the property of the metals Through which they conquer victoriously. The same is a perfection And setteth a golden crown upon it. Now the practice is completed For him who understandeth and knoweth the matter. Only two things more are to be chosen Which thou wilt find by now If thou dost follow the right way And attend carefully to thy work, The composition is the one Which the Wise Men kept secret. The nature of the fire also hath hidden craft; Therefore its order is another, With that, one should not deal too much Or else all execution is lost. One cannot be too subtle with it. As the hen hatcheth out the chick So also shall it be in the beginning, And time itself will prove it. For just as the fire is regulated Will this treasure itself be produced. Be industrious, constant, peaceful and pious, And also ask God for His help: If thou dost obtain that, then always remember The poor and their needs. ——————"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" AUREUM SECULUM REDIVIVUM That is, The Very Ancient Golden Age Having Passed Away Which now hath risen again, blossomed in loveliness, and produced fragrant golden seed.

So that I beheld the true Centrum in Trigono centri the one and true substance of the Noble Philosopher’s Stone, and although I had it in mine own hands for the length of five years, I did not know how to use it profitably, rightly, or befittingly, how to extract from it the red lion’s blood and the white eagle’s gluten , much less how to mix, enclose, and seal it according to the proportionate weight of Nature, or how to commit it to and proceed with the hidden fire, all of which must be done not without understandi ng and care. And although I searched in the scriptis , parabolis and variis Philosophorum figuris with special care and understanding, and laboured diligently to solve their manifold strange ænigmata , which existed in part in their own minds, I found out relpsa that this was sheer phantasy and nonsense, as also testify the Aurora Philosophorum . They are all foolishness, like all the præparationes , even of Geber and Albertus Magnus with their purgationes , sublimationes , cementationes , distillationes , rectificationes , circulationes , putrefactiones , conjunctiones , solutiones , assensiones , coagulationes , calcinationes , incinerationes , mortificationes , revivicationes , etc . In like manner are their tripods, Alanthor , reflecting ovens, smelting furnaces, putresce nces, horse-dung, ashes, sand, cupping-glasses, pelican vials, retorts, fixatoriums, etc., sophistica l, futile, and useless things. Personally, I have in truth to admit this; espeically since noble Na ture, which letteth itself be easily found in its own innate substance , doth not know of any of these things. There are those who look for the materiam lapidis in wine, in the imperfect body, in blood, in marcasite, in mercury, in sulphur, in urine, in stercorate, in auri-pigment, and in herbs such as chelidonium, lungwort, yew, hyssop, etc. Theophrastus, in his Secreto Magico de Lapide Philosophorum , rightly says of them: all this is villainy and thievery, with which the y mislead other people, take their money, spend and waste their time uselessly and vainly , follow only their own fool’s head, but who cannot figure out in advance the requirements of Nature. Rather tell me one thing: What dost thou think of those who burn water in the mines of the Earth, or are there also people therein who enhance the value of wine, or burn the urine of small children to make metals therewith? Or dost thou think there is any apothecary therein who hath for sale any thing with which thou canst make metals? Thou fool, canst thou not understand that thou dost err, that none of these things belong to Nature? Or dost thou want to be above God, that thou dost want to make metals out of blood? Thou mightest as we ll try to make a man out of a horse, or a cow out of a mouse, to give good milk in addition . This, too, would be a multiplication, but these things do not happen, and as little as they can happen, so little canst thou make metals with the above-mentioned recipes, for this is not a Na ture-given art. And whatever Nature hath made, no art can effect: for if a woman hath give n birth to a boy, no art can change the boy into a girl, whatever means might be employed fo r that purpose. After this short discourse, it should be easy for anyone to see how, and in what form, the materia benedicta should be sought and found. And no one should imagin e, much less be persuaded by any clowns, that he really hath in his hands the veram materiam either through the secret revelation of God or through those who claim to be acquainted with it, and no one should imagine that he would then be able to disintegrate the said veram materiam proportionately, to separate the purum ab impuro in the highest things, that he knoweth how to purify it and completely understandeth. Nay, my dear analysts, that is by no means so: therein lies the difficulty, and to such matters belong art and a skilled mind. See me, for example: as you heard from me in the beginning, for five years I was acquainted with the veram materiam lapidis , but all that time I did not know how to proceed with it, and not until the sixth year was the key to its power entrusted to me through the secret revelation of Almighty God. And the old Patriarchs, Prophets, and Philosophi have at all times kept this key hidden and secret, for the Monarcha in loco dicto saith: It would be a great theft, and no longer secret , had they revealed it in their writings, so that"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"every cobbler and tooth-drawer could understan d it, and much evil could be done that way which would be against the will of the Lord, et c.

So I have written down in this, my Aureo seculo redivivo ( Golden Age Restored ), as much as God and Nature have perm itted me, about the great secret of the Philosophers, as mine eyes have witnesses it and my hands grasped it, and how it was revealed through the mercy of God at the right time in great might and glory: and may the pious and God-loving reader take all this in good faith and accept it, examine it skilfully, and be not perturbed if at times there are words mixed up with my sayings which seem to be contrary to the letter. I could not write otherwise per Theoriam ad praxim , because it is forbidden to write more exactly and clearly about this in republica chymica . But undoubtedly all those who read this Tract in true confidence with the inner eyes of their minds, and are able to look upon it in the right way, to study it diligently, and who pray in all things inwardly and with all their heart, will enjoy, as I did, the wondrously sweet philosophical fruit hidden therein, and partake of it, accordin g to God’s will.

But my thoughts went much deeper and led me further to Moses, how he had made a potable of the solar-calf cast by Aaron, and how he had it burned with fire, ground to powder , strewed it upon the waters, and gave it to the Children of Israel to drink. And I ma rvelled most about this prompt and ingenious destruction which the hand of God had wrought. But after pondering over it for some time my eyes were opened, just as happened with the two disciples at Emmaus who knew the Lord in the Breaking of Bread, an dmy heart burned wi thin me. But I laid down and began to sleep. And, lo, in my dream King Solomon appeared to me, in all his might, wealth, and glory, leading beside him all the women of his harem: there were threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number, but one was his gentle dove, most beautiful and dearest to his heart, and according to Catholic custom she held a magnificent procession wherein the Centrum was highly honored and cherished, and its name was like an out-ointment, the fragrance of which surpassed all spices. And its fiery spirit was a key to open the temple, to enter the Holy Place, and to grasp the horns of the altar. When the procession was ended, Solomon showed unto me the unified Centrum in trigono centri and opened my understanding to me, and I became aware that behind me stood a nude woman with a bloody wound in her breast, out of which came forth blood and water, but the joints of her thighs were like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman, her navel was like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor, her belly was like an heap of wheat set about with roses, her two breasts were like two young roses that are twins, her neck was as a tower of ivory, her eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon by the gate of Bathrabbim: her nose was as the tower of Lebanon which looketh to wards Damascus. Her head was like Carmel, and the hear of her head was tied in many fold s, like king’s purple. But her garments, which she threw off, lay at her feet, and were all unsi ghtly, stinking, and poisonous. And she began to speak: I have put off my coat, how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them? The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me, and took away my veil from me. Then I wa s stricken with fear and not conscious and fell upon the ground: but Solomon bade me stand up again and said: be not afraid when thou dost see Nature bare, and the most hidden which is beneath heaven and upon the earth. She is beautiful as Tizrah, comely as Jerusalem, te rrible as an army with banners, but nevertheless she is the pure chaste virgin out of whom Ad am was made and created. Sealed and hidden is the entrance to her house, for she dwelleth in the garden and sleepeth in the twofold caves of Abraham on the field Ephron, and her place is the depths of the Red Sea, and in the deep transparent chasms, the air hath given her bir th and the fire hath brought her up, wherefore she is a queen of the country, milk and honey ha th she in her breasts. Yea, her lips are like a dripping honey-comb, honey and milk are under he tongue and the smell of her garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon to the Wise, but an abomination to the ignorant. And Solomon said further: Rouse thee, look upon all my wo men and see if you can find her equal. And forthwith the woman had to cast off her garments and I looked at her, but my mind had lost the power of judgement, and mine eyes were holden, so that I did not recognise her. But as Solomon observed my weakness, he separated his women from this nude woman and said: Thy thoughts are vain and the sun ha s burned out thy mind and thy memory is as black as fog, so thou canst not judge aright, so if thou wouldst not forfeit thy concern and take advantage of the present opportunity, then can the bloody sweat and snow-white tears of this nude virgin again refresh thee, cleanse thine un derstanding and memory and restore it fully, so that thine eyes may perceive the wonders of the Most High, the height of the uppermost, and thou shalt really fathom the foundations of all Nature, the power and operation of all the Elements, and thine understanding will be as fine silver, and thy memory as gold, the colors"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"of all precious stones will appear before thine eyes and thou wilt know their production, and thou wilt know how to separate good from evil, the goats from the sheep. Thy live will be very peaceful, but the cymbals of Aaron will aw aken thee from sleep and the harp of David, my father, from thy slumber. After Solomon thu s spake, I was very much more afraid, and was exceedingly terrified, partly because of his heartbreaking words, also partly because of the great glamor and splendor of the present queenly woman, and Solomon took me by the hand and led me through a wine cellar into a se cret but very stately hall, where he refreshed me with flowers and apples, but its windows were made out of transparent crytals and I looked through them. And he said: What dost thou see? I replied: I can only see from this hall into the hall I just left, and on the left standeth thy queenly woman, and on the right the nude virgin, and her eyes are redder than wine, her teeth whiter than milk, but her garments at her feet are more unsightly, blacker, and more filthy than the brook of Kidron. From all of them choose one, said Solomon to be thy belo ved. I esteem her an d my queen alike and highly, pleased as I am with the loveliness of my wives, so little do I care about the abomination of her garments. And as soon as the king had thus spoken, he turned around and conversed in a very friendly way with one of his queens. Amongst these was an hundred-year-old stewardess, with a grey cloa k, a black cap upon her head, bedecked with numberless snow-white pearls and lined with red velvet, and embroidred and sewn in an artful manner with blue and yellow silk, and her cloak was adorned with divers Turkish colors and Indian figures: this old woman beckon ed to me secretly and sw ore unto me an holy oath that she was the mother of the nude virgin , that she had been born from her body, and that she was a chaste, pure, and secluded virgin , that until now she had not suffered any man to look upon her, and although she had let herself be used everywhere among the many people on the streets, no one had ever seen her naked before now, and no one had touched her, for she was the virgin of whom the Prophet said: Behold, we have a son born unto us in secret, who is transformed beside others; behold, the virgin had brought forth, such a virgin as is called Apdorossa , meaning: secretly, she who cannot suffer others. But while this her daughter was as yet unwed, she had her marriage- portion lying under her feet, because of the present danger of the war, so that she would be robbed of it by some roving soldiery and denuded of her stately treasure. However I should not be frightened because of her disgusting garments, but choose her daughter befo re all others for the delight of my love and life. Then she would give and reveal to me a lye to clean her garments, and then I would obtain a liquid salt and non-combustible oil for my house-keeping, and an immeasurable treasure, and her right hand would always caress me and her left hand would be under my head. And as I then wanted to declare myself categorically upon this matter, Solomon turned around again, looked upon me, and said: I am the wisest man on earth, beautiful and pleasing are my wives and the glamor of my queens surp asseth the gold of Ophir; the adornments of my concubines overshadow the rays of the sun, and the beauty of my virgins surpasseth the rays of the moon, and as heavenly as are my women, my wisdom is unfathomable and my knowledge is inexplicable. Whereupon I answered and, half afraid, I bowed: Lo, I have found grace in thine eyes, and since I am poor, give me this nude virgin. I choose her amongst all others for the duration of my life, and though her garments are filthy and torn, I will clean them and love her with all mine heart, and she sh all be my sister, my bride, because she hath ravished mine heart with one of her eyes, with one chain of her neck. When I had thus spoken, Solomon gave her unto me, and there was a great commotion in the hall of his women, so that I was awakened by it, and I knew not what had happened to me, nevertheless I believed it to be but a dream and I thought many subtle thoughts about my dream until the morning. But after I had arisen and said my prayers, Lo! I saw the garments of the nude virgin before my bed, but no trace of her. An d I began to be greatly afraid and my hair stood upright upon my head and my whole body wa s bathed in cold sweat; but I took heart, recalling my dream, and thought about it again in the fear of the Lord. But my thoughts did not explain it, and for this reason I dared not to scrutinize the garments, much less to recognize anything in them. I then changed my sleeping-chamber and I left the garments in it for some length of time ex mera tamen ignorantia , in the belief that if I were to touch them or turn them over, something peculiar would happen to me, but in my sleep the smell of the"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"garments had poisoned and inflamed my violently, so that mine eyes could not see the time of mercy, and never could mine heart recognise the great wisdom of Solomon. After the above-mentioned garments had lain for five years in my sleeping-chamber and I knew not what they were good for, I finally thought to burn them, in order to clean up the place. And then I spent the whole day going ar ound with such thoughts. But the next night there appeared to me in my dream the hundred- year-old woman and she spake harshly to me thus: Thou ungrateful man: for five years ha ve I entrusted to thee my daughter’s garments: among them are her most precious jewels, and during all that time thou hast neither cleaned them nor thrown out of them the moths and worms, and now, finally, thou dost want to burn these clothes, and is it not enough that thou ar t the reason for the death and perishing of my daughter? Whereupon I became hot-headed an d answered her: How shall I understand thee, that thou wouldst make a murderer of me? For five years mine eyes have not beheld thy daughter, and not the least did I hear of her, ho w then can I be the cause of her death? But she would not let me finish, and said: It is all true, but thou hast sinned against God, therefore thou couldst not obtain my daughter, nor the philosophical Exvivium I promised thee for washing and cleaning her garments: for in the beginning, when Solomon willingly gave thee my daughter, and when thou didst abhor her ga rments, that made furious the Planet Saturn, who is her grandfather, and full of wrath was he that he transformed her again into what she had been before her birth: and since you in furiated Saturnus through thine abhorring, thou didst cause her death, putrefaction, and her final destruction, for she is the one of whom Senior saith: Ah, woe! to bring a nude woman unto me, when my first body was not good to look upon, and I had never been mother until I was born again, then I brought forth the power of all roots of herbs, and in mine innermost being I was victorious. Such and similar heart- breaking words were very strange to me, bu t nevertheless I withheld mine indignation as much as was humanly possible for me , at the same time protesting solemniter against her sayings: that I knew nothing at all about her daughter, much less about her death and putrefaction, and although I kept her garments for five years in my sleeping-chamber, I did not know them for my great blindness nor ever discovered their use, and therefore I was innocent before God and all others. This, my righteous and well-founded excuse, must have pleased the old woman not a little, for she looked at me and said: I feel and observe from thy righteous mind, that thou art innocent, and thine innocence shall be rewarded well and plentifully, therefore I will reveal to thee secretly and out of my good heart, namely that my daughter, out of special love and affection towa rds thee, hath left thee a gray marbled casket as an inheritance amongst her garments, which is covered with a rough, black, dirty case (and meanwhile she gave me a glass filled with lye, and continued speaking), this same little casket thou shalf clean from its stench and dirt, which it hath received from the garments. Thou hast no need of a key, but it will open itself, and thou wilt find two things therein: a white silver box, filled with magnificent ground-lead and po lished diamonds, and another golden work of art, adorned with costly silver rubies: and this is the treasure and entire legacy of my deceased daughter which she left for thee to inherit before her transformation. If thou wilt only transfer this treasure and purify it most highly and s ilently and lock it up with great patience in a warm, hidden, steamy, transparent and moist cella r, and protect it from freezing, hail, quick lightning, hot thunder, and other outward destruc tion till the wheat harvest, then thou wilt first perceive the entire glory of thine inheritanc e and take part of it. Meanwhile I awoke for a second time and called upon God, full of fear, praying that He would open mine understanding that I might seek for the casket which was promised me in my dream. And after my prayer was ended I sought with greatest diligence in the garments and found the casket, but the casing was tight around it and seemed grown onto it by nature, so that I was not able to take it off: then I could not clean it with any lye nor split it with iron, steel, or any other metal. I left it alone once more and did not know what to do with it, and held it to be witchcraft, thinking of the prophet’s saying: For though thou wash thee with lye, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord God. And after a year had passed gain and I did no t know, after speculating and industriously deliberating, how to remove the casing, I finally went to walk in the garden to rid myself of the melancholy thoughts, and after long promenad ing, I sat down on a flinty stone and fell into a deep sleep. I slept, but my heart was awake: there appeared unto me the hundred-year-"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"old stewardess and said: Hast thou received my daughter’s inheritance? In a sad voice I answered no, though I found the casket, but alone it is still impossible for me to separate the casing therefrom, and the lye thou hast given me will not work on the casing. After this simple speech the old woman smiled and said: Do st thou want to eat shells and shellfish with the shells? Do they not have to be brought forth and prepared by the very old planet and cook Vulcan? I told thee to clean the gray casket thoroughly with the lye given thee, and which proceeded wholly from it, and was not refined from the outer rough casing. This thou hast especially to burn in the fire of the philoso phers, then everything will turn out for the best. And thereupon she gave me several glowing coals wrapped up in white light taffeta and instructed me further and pointed out that I sh ould make therefrom a philosophical and quite artful fire and burn the casing, then I would soon find the grey casket. And presently every hour a north and south wind rose, both swee ping at the same time through the garden, whereupon I awoke, rubbed the sleep out of mi ne eyes, and noticed that the glowing coals wrapped in white taffeta lay at my feet: with haste and joy I grasped them, prayed diligently, called upon God, studied and laboured day and night, and thought meanwhile of the great and excellent sayings of the Philosophers , who say: Ignis et azoth tibi sufficiunt . About this Esdras saith in his fourth book: And he gave unto me a full cup which was full of fire, and his form was as of fire, and when I had drunk of it, my heart uttered understanding, and wisdom grew in my breast, for my spirit retained it s memory, and my mouth was opened and shut no more. The Most High gave understanding unto the five men, and they wrote by course the things that were told them, in ch aracters which they knew not. So in forty days were written 204 books, 70 for the wisest alone, who were tr uly worthy of it, and all were written on boxwood. And then I proceeded in silento et spe , as the old woman had revealed to me in my dream, until, according to Solomon’s predictio n, after a long time my knowledge became silver and my memory became golden. But acco rding to the instruction and teaching of the old stewardess, I enclosed and lock ed up in a proper and quite artistic manner the treasure of her daughter, namely: the splendid and brilliant lunar diamonds and the solar rubies, both of which came forth and were found from the casket and the landscape. I heard the voice of Solomon who said: My beloved is white and r uddy, the chiefest among ten thousand. His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bush y, and black as a raven. His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed wi th milk, and fitly set. His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips are like roses, dropping sweet smelling myrrh. His hands are as gold rings sest with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires. His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars. His moth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem. Therefore shalt thou hold him, and not let him go, until thou bringest him into his mother’s house, and into his mother’s chamber. And when Solomon had spoken these words I kn ew not how to answer him, and I became silent, but I wanted nevertheless to open up ag ain the locked-up treasure, with which I might remain unmolested. Then I heard another voice: I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, tha t ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till she please, for she is a garden inclosed, a spring sh ut up, a fountain sealed, the vineyard at Baal- hamon, the vineyard at Engeddi, the garden of fruits and spices, the mountain of myrrh, the hill of frankincense, the bed, the litter, the cro wn, the palm-tree and apple-tree, the flower of Sharon, the sapphire, the turquoise, the wall, to wer, and rampart, the garden of joy, the well in the garden, the spring of living water, the ki ng’s daughter, and the love of Solomon in his concupiscence: she is the dearest to her mother, and the chosen of her mother, but her head is filled with dew, and her locks with the drops of the night. Through this discourse and revelation I was so far informed that I knew the purpose of the Wise and did not touch the locked treasure until through God’s mercy, the working of noble Nature, and the work of mine own hands, the work was happily completed. Shortly after this time, just on the day of the month when the moon was new, there occurred an eclipse of the sun, showing itself in all its terrifying power, in the beginning dark green and some mixed colors, until finally it became coal-black, darkened heaven and earth, and many people were much afraid, but I rejo iced, thinking of God’s great mercy, and the new birth, as Christ Himself pointed out to us , that a grain of wheat must be cast into the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"ground, that it may not rot therein, else it br ingeth forth no fruit. And then it happened that the darkness was covered with clouds, and the su n began to shine through, yet at the same time three parts of it were still heavily darkened: and lo, an arm broke through the clouds, and my body trembled because o fit, and it held in its hand a letter with four seals hanging down from it, on which stood written: I am black, bu t comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon: L ook not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me, et c. But as soon as the fixum acted in the humidum , a rainbow spanned itself and I thought of the covenant of the Most High, and of the fidelity of my Ductoris , and of what I had learned, and lo, with the help of the planet and the fixed stars, the sun overcame the darkness, and over every mo untain and valley there came a lovely and bright day; then all fear and terror had an end, and everything beheld this day and rejoiced, praised the Lord, and said: The winter is past, the rain is over and gone; the flowers appear on the earth: the time of the singing of birds is co me, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land: the fig tree putteth forth her green figs, an d the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Therefore let us make haste to take the foxes, the little foxes that spoil the vines, that we may gather the grapes in time and with the make and drink wine, and be fed at the right time with milk and honey-comb: that we may eat and be filled. And after the day was done and the evening fell, the whole heaven grew pale, and the seven stars rose with yellow rays and pursued their natural courses through the night, until in the morning they were overshadowed by the breaking of the sun’s red dawn. And behold, the Wise who dwelt in the land arose from their slumber, looked heavenward , and said: Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and there is no spot in her, for her ardor is fiery and not unlike a flame of the Lord: so tha t no water may extinguish the love, nor any river drown it; therefore we will not leave her, fo r she is our sister, and though she is yet little, and hath no breasts, we will bring her again i nto her mother’s house, into a shining hall, where she hath been before, to suck her mother’ s breasts. Then she will come forth like a tower of David, built with ramparts whereon ha nd a thousand shields, and many arms of the mighty men; and as she went forth the daughter praised her openly; but I fell upon my face, thanked God, and praised His Holy Name. ——————————— "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"EPILOGUS And thus is brought to a close, ye beloved and true Sapientiæ et doctrinæ filii , in all its power and its glory, the great secret of the Wise , and the revelation of the Spirit, about which the Prince and Monarch Theoph. in Apocalypsi Hermetis saith: It is a single Numen , a divine, wondrous, and holy office, while it incloseth the whole world within it, and will become true with all else, and truly overcometh the elements and the five substances. Eye hath not seen, nor hath ear heard, neither have entered the hear t of any man, how the heaven hath naturally embodied to truth of this Spirit, in it the truth doth stand alone, therefore it is called the voice of truth. To this power Adam and the other pa triarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, owed their bodily health, their long life, and finally pros pered in great wealth thereby. With the aid of this Spirit, the Philosophi founded the seven free arts, and acquired their wealth therewith. With it Noah built the Ark, Moses the Tabern acle, and Solomon the Temple and through this provided the golden vessels from pure gold in the Temple, and for the glory of God. Solomon also wrought with it many fine works and did other great deeds. With it Esdras again established the Commandment; and with it Miriam, the sister of Moses, was hospitable. And this Spirit was much used and very common amon gst the prophets of the Old Testament. Likewise it is a medicine and a cure for all things, and the final revelation, the final and highest secret of Nature. It is the Spirit of the Lord which hath filled the sphere of the earthly kingdom, and moved upon the face of the wate rs in the beginning. The world could neither understand nor grasp it without the secret gracio us inspiration of the Holy Ghost, or without secret teaching. For the whole world longest fo r it because of its great powers, which cannot be appreciated enough by men, and for which the saints have sought from the creation of the world, and have fervently desired to see. For this Spirit goeth into the seven planets, raiseth the clouds, and dispelleth the mists, giveth light to all things, transformeth everything into gold and silver, giveth health and abundance, tr easures, cleanseth leprosy, cureth dropsy and goat, cleareth the face, prolongeth life, strengthe neth the sorrowful, healeth the sick and all the afflicted, yea, it is a secret of all secrets, on e secret thing of all secret things, and healing and medicine for all things. Likewise it is and remaineth unfathomable in nature, and endless power and an invincible might and glory, that is a passionate craving for knowledge, and a lovely thing of all things which are beneath the circle of the moon, with which Nature is made strong, and the heart with all members is renewed, and kept in blossoming youth, age is driven away, weakness destroyed, and the entire world refreshed. Likewise this Spirit is a spirit chosen abov e all other heavenly things or spirits, which giveth health, luck, joy, peace, love, expellin g altogether all evil, destroying poverty and misery, and also causing that one can neither ta lk nor think evil; it giveth to men what they desire from the depths of their hearts, worldly ho nor and long life to the godly, but eternal punishement to the evil-doers, who put it to improper use. To the Most High Almighty God who hath created this art and who hath also been pleased to reveal this knowledge unto me, a mise rable sinful man, through a promise and true vow, to Him be given praise, honor, glory, an d thanks, with an entirely humble and fervent prayer that He will direct my heart, mind, and senses through His Holy Ghost, so governing that I talk to no one about this secret, much less communicate to some one who doth not fear God, nor reveal it to any other creature, lest I break my vow and oath, and break the heavenly seals, and thus become a perjured Brother Auræ Crucis , and utterly offend the Divine Majesty, and thereby commit and perpetrate knowingly an unpardonable mighty sin against the Holy Ghost. Wherefore may God the Father, Son an d Holy Ghost, the Most Blessed Trinity, mercifully preserve and protect me constantly. Amen. Amen. Amen. F I N I S.

This fire the priests took with them when they were le d away into the Babylonian captivity, and they were commanded by the Prophet Nehemiah, also called Jeremiah, to hide the holy fire in a cave, until they again returned home; and then have the priests looked for it; but instead of the fire, they foun d a dense water, but as soon as they poured it over the wood and sacrifice it was ignite d by the Sun and the sacrifice and the wood were devoured by the water and the fire.

So also the Laborant may have nothing else to do besides attending on the fire, pray God for His blessings and benedictions. With true reason we say that it is Nature itself which rules this art through boiling in its fire and own container. Nature, as far as it is governed by Heavenly things, till the work be done and even thereafter. But the will is free and may leave Nature to control the result of the work, and set a certain limit beyond which Nature will not go. Since the will rules Nature it should also attract it, but if the will does not attract and is itself subjected to Nature, Nature will go beyond the purposes of the work and destroy the same."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"12 12 12 12 12 12 12 A O M G H H I C FATHER WORD WORD W OR D H.

PROBAT FIDEM Included in this figure is Eternity and Time, God and Man, Angel and Devil, Heaven and Hell, the Old and the New Jerusalem, together with all creatures, beings, time and hours CONSTANTIA. There is a Word speaking eternally, Self out of itself, in itself, but still not itself, It may never be spoken out! Egos, everything, nothing, hell, heaven, earth. Light, night, good, bad, body, spirit, this, that, Yes, no, I, thou, give, take, do, let, Sense, will, reason, no reason, here, there, Sorrow, joy, scorn, love, quiet, time, eternity, Soul, angel, devil, life, death, stillness, Sound, one, none, Man, yes even God. The Word cannot even reach itself, Cannot be compared to anything And yet it is at all times All in All Jesus Christ! He speaks, does not speak, is being spoken, Speaks out, speaks in, remains unspoken, Creates everything Himself, remains uncreated, But is Himself what He created: From the innermost out, from the outermost in, He has been, is, is not, but will be. One God, one Lord, one Spirit, one Unit: Whoever does not believe this, cannot understand anything. For from BELIEF comes understanding, So speaks the Spirit, and writes the Hand, First believe it, then try it, If found good, then praise it.
