All the full copies of this work I have access to reproduce the plates in black and wh ite; colours in the following are in some instances conjectural restorations, in some instances based on low-resolution images found on the Web, and in a few cases based on the description of the Geheime Figuren in A. E. Waite’s Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross . A comparison of the contents of the AMORC edition with Waite’s account tends to support the editorial claim that it contains all the material from the 1785-1788 publication (I have seen a few references to an undated third part of the original work which has not been translated). The Engelke translation was first issued in 1935 in Chicago; a limited number of copies of this edition were hand-coloured. It was subsequently reprinted, scaled down, in A Christian Rosenkreutz Anthology , from which printing it was in turn pirated by the Masonic publisher Kessinger in the 1990s . A ‘popular edition’ (stapled booklet form, paper covers, uncoloured) was issued by AMORC in 1967 and reprinted in 1987. The Kessinger edition appears to be the only one currently in print. Franz Hartmann’s version of the Secret Symbols ( Cosmology or Universal Science &c. &c. &c. , Boston, 1888) is woefully incomplete and garble d, a travesty rather than a translation. The introductory material from the AMOR C edition (a one-page preface by H. Spencer Lewis, a two-page unsigned forewo rd, probably by the translator, and a two- page bibliographic note) is here omitted. Some doubtful readings on a few plates have been corrected against M.P. Hall’s Codex Rosæ Crucis: D.O.M.A. , which contains a facsimile and translation of an MS. codex of the “D.O.M.A. Text,” from which 20 of the plates in the Geheime Figuren (as well as the long title) derived in whole or part. No attempt has been made to retain paginati on and layout on text sections, which in the print edition of the Engelke translation (fo llowing the first edition) were printed in comparatively small type in two columns.

ANNO M. DC. XXV. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"F OREWORD T O THE R EADER IN SEARCH OF THE A RT B E NOT SURPRISED , my dear Reader and honest Investigator of Nature’s Secrets, that I should undertake to write this short Treatise when in this final age the world standeth with one foot already in the grave, while close at hand many libraries are found full of books which are written about this Materia , the majority of which, however, instill a false philosophy and give fictitious formulæ. I have not written for my own sake, but for thy sake, to show thee the ground of truth, and to lead thee from wrong ways which seem impo rtant to thee. As far as I am concerned, I already know what is necessary for me to know of this, hence I have no need of books. For in the past twenty-two years I have read as many as I could lay hands on, and there have been not a few written as well as printed. Thou wilt find described herein the Materia and the Solution theorice , and also the entire praxis in its allegoria wilt thou find completely implied, as plainly and clearly as thou mayest hope to find from any Philosopher. I have studiously applied myself to consult thereon with the Philosophi . and I have called attention to all the places where they have mentioned this or that aphorism, so that thou mayest thyself see, look up theirs books, compare both the concept and my allegata , and sharpen thine understanding with it. Now I might have written this Treatise with much less effort by omitting my allegata , and could have made myself known to the Fratres aureæ crucis: but, as said before, it is all for the best that thou mayest gather more understanding therefore. Thou shouldest not be surprisd that I have kept my name hidden and that I do not reveal myself to thee personally: for I do not seek vain honor, and I am not intent on making a great name for myself in this world, but I am thinking only of thy profit. Besides, my Masters, the true Philosophi , taught me not to risk my life at all for the sake of fame, and offer myself to greedy robbers, and load great sins upon myself by prostituting this great secret. They who taught me this were the true Philosophi , my Teachers . The reader will learn from Sendivogius that as often as he doth reveal himself to the great lo rds it is every time to his hurt and the increase of danger. And experience proves that different Philosophi who did not take sufficient care of their treasures, were choked to death and robbed of their Tincture by greedy and vain fellows who risked their souls for that purpose. Reason assert eth that whoever carrieth so great a treasure with him doth not like to be robbed of it. Sendivogius concealed his name in his Anagramatismis . A short time ago a new Frater aureæ crucis also made himself known in an Anagramata and Ænigmata, and his name is well known to me. Why then should I lay myself bare before the whole world? Let this be sufficient for thee, dear friend, that I ma ke myself known to the Wise, and at the same time withhold my name from thee, which I have the n done without fault, commending the rest to our Lord God, who will reveal me to thee if it sh ould please Him, and if it should be advantageous to me and to thee. Do not let thy self long to search out my name: for even if thou shouldst ever find it and should know me, thou wo uldest still have to be content with this Treatise . For I have sworn with Bernhardus of Trevisan and other Philosophi , in all justice to reveal nothing more than is done here. And do not be concerned at all about whether I have this treasure in my hands. But rather ask if I have seen how the world was creat ed? How the darkness came over Egypt? What is the cause of the rainbow? How the transfigured bodies will look after the Day of Judgement? Which is the most constant color? But I ask of you who understand my booklet whether ye have seen the great and universal salty sea, without any corrosive matter, which is in itself sufficient to carry the Tinctures of all things up onto the highest mountains? Tell me. Where doth Sulphur become Sulphur, and where doth Mercury come forth from Mercury? Likewise, where will Sulphur come forth from Mercury, and Mercury fro m Sulphur? When have your eyes beheld the symbol of ardent love, as when man and woman so embrace each other that they will be no more separated through all eternity, but become one in glorious love? Do ye understand what I am talking about? If ye have worked out these thi ngs with your own hands, and beheld with your own eyes, then I am your consociates, and make known to you that I also know, and that I like nothing better than to receive your secret messa ge: for that purpose I want to write this little Treatise."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"But if anyone should complain about the difficu lty of this art, then let him know that this art in itself is not difficult at all, that it will be easy for those who love God and who are by Him deemed worthy of it, will find it quite easy. However, if some one should accuse me of ha ving written all too plainly and clearly about the art, so that everyone could understand it: to him I answer that it is true that I have written about it lucidly enough for those who were found worthy in God’s sight, but the unworthy will do well to leave it alone. I have previously set for th the entire art, word for word, to the over-clever ones, but they ridiculed it in their hearts, and did not believe that in our work was a twofold resurrection from the dead. Therefore is our art in Theoria and practica , a pure gift of God, who giveth it to whom, and when, He will, and it do th not depend on any man’s willing or doing. I have known it with all circumstantiæ , and manipulations for fully seventeen or eighteen years, and yet I had to wait until it pleased God to bestow up on me His grace. Also, no one should doubt the certainty and truth of this art, espeically since it is as true, as certain in Nature and as undoubtedly ordered by God as that the sun shineth by day and the moon by night. Herewith I shall bring to a close this little Præfatio , and begin with the Treatise itself. But you, my beloved Fratri aureæ crucis , who have now and then kept yourselves hidden in secret and enjoy the gifts of the High God in His fear, hearken unto my words, and hide not fro m me, and if so be you know me, let it be known to you that the Cross trieth out the faithful an d revealeth their faith in the light of day, but such are kept hidden for the sake of safety and delight. God be with us all. AMEN. ————————————————————————— T RACTATUS A UREUS D EAR BELOVED R EADER and Follower of the True Wisdom: The old and new Philosophi , after they attained the goal of their desires through divine grace, took care in their writings to make themselves known to their fellow-students, who ke pt themselves hidden here and there in the world, and to indicate that the true God had enlig htened their understanding, blessed the work of their hands, and revealed to them the great secr et of earthly wisdom. Wherefore they rightly pledged themselves to give Him all praise, honor, and glory. And then also they promised that they would bequeath to their fellow-Christians and art-seeking disiplces at the same time instruction and information, so that they at once the reby might also love and be loved by God, and attain to understanding and knowledge of such Secreta . And there have been such people amongst all nations, such as the Egyptians, the most eminent of whom was Hermes Trismegistus , the Chaldeans, Greeks, Arabs, Italians, English, Spaniards, Germans, Poles, Hungarians, Jews, an d many others. There is nothing surprising about it, althought the said Wise Men wrote in different languages at different times, there is nevertheless unity and agreement and general consensus to be found in their writings, that every true Philosopher could soon recognise that God had favored them with His great blessing, and that the had had the Work itself in their own hand s. And just as truth manifesteth itself in Harmonia , so on the contrary must Dissonantia bring every Sophist and supposed Philosophers into the open. For while he never rightly knoweth the secret of the Wise and pursueth his way according to his own mind, every man who is cognisant of the art will see his error. But Harmonia and concord especially consist main of these two points, viz . in knowledge of the Materia , their Solution , weight, fire, and Augmentation . With respect to the Materia , it is such that it hath within itself everything which is necessary for it, hence all that the lover of the art desireth will be made of it, namely nisus in arena , the the Philosopher Anastratus saith in the Turba Philosophorum : There is nothing more precious than the r ed sand of the sea, and this is the Moon’s saliva, which is added to the Sun’s light and Coagulated . But that such a unified Materia is necessary, Agadmon himself testified, saying: Know that if ye do not take my Corpus , which hath no spirit, yet will not ob tain what ye are looking for: and this because no alien substance shall come into your work, and know also that nothing else is required for it except that which is pure. Ther efore renounce all multiplicity. For Nature is satisfied with only one thing, and whosoever doth not know that, he will perish. Even likewise"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"doth Arnoldus de Villanove express himself in his booklet called Flos florum : Our stone is made out of one thing and is made with one thing. Likewise doth he say to the King of Neopolis : Everything contained in our stone is essential to its existe nce, and it doth not have need of anything else, especially since the stone is of one nature and one thing. And Rosinus saith: Be thou sure that it is only one thing, whereof everything is made that thou dost desire. And Lilius : Thou art in need of but the one thing, which changeth into a different nature at every step our work. Also saith Geber in his Summa : It is but one stone, one medicine, to wh ich we add nothing, and from which we take nothing, only seperating the superfluous from it. And Scites saith in the Turba : The foundation of this art is something that is stronger and higher than any other thing, and is called the sharp vinegar, which is the cause of the gold becoming a pure spirit, without which neither whiteness, blackness, nor redness could exist; and when it is mixed with the body, then it becometh one with the body, and transformeth it into a spirit, andit coloreth it with spiritual and unchangeable color, and receiveth from that which is colored its bodily color in turn, which cannot be obliterated: and if thou shouldst out the body into the fire without the vinegar, then it would be consumed. But some one might draw the conclusion from the sayings of Scites that not one but two things are required, namely: the body and the vinega r, as he calleth it: and it is necessary that a moist and a dry be joined together, so that the dr y will not be consumed by the fire, but will be protected by the moisture from the burnin g fire. I must truly consent to such Argument and conclusion, if it be rightly understood, but nevertheless I must maintain the above-mentioned philosophical sayings in their merit and truth. Because it is certain for one thing that the one Materia of our blessed stone hath many names amongst the Philosophers, which Nature hath prepared for the artist, and for the Materia of the great stone alone, and hath ordained otherwise nothing else in the world. This is before the eyes of everyone, the enti re world seeth it, apprehendeth it, loveth it, but still doth not comprehend it. It is noble and bad, dear and cheap, costly and low-priced, and is found everywhere. Theophrastus Paracelsus calleth it the “Red Lion” in his book De Tinctura Physica , much mentioned, but little known. Hermes , in his book, chapter 1, calleth it: Mercury, which is hardened in the innermost cells. In the Turba it is sometimes named Aes or Ore: in the Rosario Philosophorum it is called Salt. In the Summa this Materia hath as many names as there are things in the world. That is the reason why it is so little understood by the ignorant. I call them ignorant because they proceed to the art without prev ious knowledge of Nature and her qualities: as Arnoldus saith: They proceed like an ass going to it s manger, and which doth not know what it is going to receive into its opened mouth. Therefore in his Summa perfectionis , Geber saith truly and rightly: He who hath no knowledge by himself of the beginning of Nature is still far from this art. And Rosarius saith: I advise that no one commit himself to finding this art save he who hath knowledge of the beginning of true Nature and its order: then when he hath knowl edge of this he doth not need more than this one thing, and it doth not require great expense. For it is not more than a stone, a medicine, a phial, an order, and a preparation. Thus will our Materia be separated with the help of Nature and the intelligent manipulations of the Artisan , so that it will be transmuted into the “White Eagle,” as Theophrastus saith, and the radiance of the Sol doth not shine after the Spagyrization , or (as Basilius Valentinus saith) out of it cometh a spirit as white as snow and another spirit as red as blood, both of which spirits have the third hidden within themselves. King Aros spake well when he said: Our medicine will be one substance made out of two, name ly out of the unification of the constant, of the spiritual and bodily, of the cold and moist, warm and dry nature, and it cannot be made out of anything else. And Richardus Anglicus saith: It is a stone and a medicine made out of the Philosophis Rebis, i. e. , out of two things, namely, out of the body and the spirit, white or red: and many fools have erred therein by explain ing in many different ways the verse: Est rebis in dictis rectissima norma figuris . That is, two things, and these two things are one thing, namely: the water added to the body, and such dissolved in a spirit, that is, into a mineral water out of the body and spirit, which is the Elixir that is called a Fermentum . For then the water and the spirit are one thing from which is made the Tincture and medicine in which all bodies are purified. Therefore our medicine is compounded out of one thing, this being the water and the spirit of the body. And so we have, according to the Philosophi , the nature of Sulphur and Mercury above the earth, from which are made gold and silver beneath the earth. And Bernhardus , Count of Trevisan , saith: Our work is taken raw from one root and two mercuria l subtances and is drawn, clean and pure, from the Minera , etc. And in his book Concerning Natural and Supernatural Things , Basileus Valentinus"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"saith in the 4th chapter: I will reveal unto thee tru thfully and through the love of God, that there is to be found the root of the philosophical Sulphur, which is a heavenly spirit, together with the root of the spiritual but natural Mercurii , which is the beginning of the spiritual salt in one, and is found in one Materia , out of which the Stone, destined for me, was made, and not in many things. And although Mercury by itself is found by all Ph ilosophers, and Sulphur by itself, and Salt is drawn particularly from itself, so Mercurius will be found in one element, Sulphur in one, and Salt in one. Nevertheless I say unto thee that they aris e only out of their superfluity, which is found most plentifully and can be use particulariter in many ways with advantage, and be prepared for medicine and for transmutation of metals. But the Universal alone is the highest earthly treasure, and all three things in their beginning are one thing only and extracted therefrom, which can make one out of all metals: and this is the true Spiritus Mercurii and Anima Sulphuris including the Spiritual Salt at the same time united and encl osed under one heaven and dwelling in one body, and this is the Dragon and the Eagle, it is the Ki ng and the Lion, it is the Spirit and the Corpse, which must color the corpse of the Gold into a Medicine, etc. So now our prepared Materia is called the man and the woman. Likewise with resptect to tbe working and the suffering. Zimon saith in the Turba : Know ye that the secret of this work existeth in the man and the woman, i.e. in the producing and suffering. In lead is the man, in Auripigment is the woman. The man rejoiceth over the woman whom he hath received unto himself, and she helpeth hi m, and the woman receiveth from the man a coloring seed and is colored by him. And Diamedes saith: Join together the manly son of the Red Knight to his fragrant wife, and thus joined together they will beget the Art, to which there should be added no aJien matter nor powder nor any other thing, and be ye content with the conception: so shall the true son be born unto you. O how precious is the Materia of the Red Knight, without whom no order can exist! Others call it Argentum vivum or Mercurius and Sulphur or Fire. As Rogerius Baco saith in Speculum Alchemiaæ , chapter 3: All metals are born out of Sulphur and Mercurius , and nothing is connected with them, for if nothing be added to them, nothing will change them save what is derived from them. Therefore we must rightly take Mercurius and Sulphur for the Materia of the stone. And Menabadus saith: Whosoever addeth Mercury to the body of Magnesia and the Male to the Felamale, draweth out the hidden nature, with which the bodies will be colored. And Lullius saith in his Codicil : It is the quality of our Mercurius that it letteth itself be coagulated by its Sulphur. And in the Practica of his Testament he saith: The Mercury is an overflowing and running moisture, thus preserved fro m the burning. Others call it body, spirit, soul. Thus Arnoldus in Flos florum saith: The Philosophi have said that our stone is composed at the same time from body, soul, and spirit, and they have spoken the truth. For they have compared the unperfected Corpus to the body, because it is weak. They have called the water spirit, and this with truth, as it is a spirit. But to the Fermentum they have given the name of soul because it giveth to the unperfected body the life which it did not ha ve before, and it thus produceth a better form. And a little before this he saith: The spirit will not be joined to its body except through the medium of the souls. For the soul is the medium between the body and the spirit, which joineth both together. And Morienus saith: The soul quickly entereth its body: but if thou wouldst join it to another body, thou wouldst work in vain. And Lullius saith: Soul, spirit, and body are together, and are one thing, which hath everything in itself, to which nothing alien is added. But why is it necessary that one bring up all the names which people call our Materia and of explaining them? Let it be sufficient for our purpose to have me ntioned the ones most commonly used. And after we have explored where this, our MAteria , came from and where it will arrive, then we will consider a little the Solution as the principal part of the whole art, and through reflection we shall sharpen our reason and understanding. Proceding now to the consideration of what our Materia is and where it must be obtained: it is to be known that the Almighty Creator, whose wi sdom is as great as He Himself, hath created two things in tbe beginning, when there was nothi ng but Himself: the heavenly things and those that are under the heaven. The heavenly thing s are themselves in heaven, and the heavenly inhabitants, about whom we do not want to have philosophical discourses at this time. The created works under the heavens are produced from the four elements, and their numbers are to be founds in three species, namely: firs t those that have life and feeling, called Animalia ; then secondly everything which groweth out of the earth but hath not feeling, and called Vegetabilia . Finally everything growing beneath the earth, and called Mineralia ."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Now these three species of creation comprise everything created out of the four elements under the moon, and neither more nor fewer of them will be found, and the Most High God hath approved of each of them in its species and kind, so that not one of them can be transformed from one kind of species to another. As if one could make a man or a tree out of a stone, or a monkey out of an herb or lead; or out of lead make some other animal or herb. Such, I say, is impossible, by decreee of the Great King. If such were perm itted in Nature, there would be fewer of their kind, yea, one could be transformed into any of the others. But as all would therefore fall into great confusion. the Lord of all lords hath decr eed that such a metamorphosis of species shaIl not be permitted. And what is more, not only hath He preserved the three species, each true to its kind, but He hath given to every creature a seed, to increase and reproduce its own likeness with it, and these forms should not be transformed into any other form, as a man into a horse, or an apple tree into lettuce, or a diamond or other stone into gold. So I say: In Nature such things are not permitted. And as it hath been since the begi nning, so will it be until the day cometh when the Almighty, as He said in the beginning: Let these be, will say: Let it perish. But it is fully permitted that among the things which have a common Materia , seed and composition of the elemments, a refinement of their conditions may be accomplis hed and achieved, according to the purity and perfection of their Materia . Thus one seeth a man who hath a much nobler and intelligent mind, because of the pure and subtle spirits which originate in the justified and well-tempered Constitution of the bodies, rising higher than others, who do not have such acutre and subtle understanding. So, too, on seeth how one horse is much nobler than another, and the sa me thing is to be observed in nearly all the species animalium . And as is the case with animal spei ces, so is it also found amongst the superabounding herbs and trees. In trees throu gh implanting, grafting, and others means well known to the gardner: amongst the herbs and flow ers one can observe every day how one is more noble, more beautiful, more fragrant, better, fi ner tasting than the other: one hath only to look upon the Caryophylli , or carnations, and the Tulips , and I will not say here how many kinds there are, for no one can begin to count them, which, through constant attention and improvement, can be taller and finer, so that some flowers are to be produced so beautiful and fragrant that one might think there had been none of their kind before. Now what shall I say about the metals? Their common Materia is Mercury, which is boiled and coagulated from Sulphur. As Richardus Anglicus , chapler 6, saith: The qualities of all liquid and fusible things were wrought by Nature from the e ssence of Mercury and its Sulphur: for it is the quality of Mercury that it cannot be burned and co agulated by any fumes or heat of red or white Sulphur. And Arnoldus . in the first volume, chapter 2, of his Perfectum Magisterium et Gaudium , saith: Mercury is the source of all things which can be di ssolved, for as soon as a metal is dissolved it turneth into Mercury and can be mixed with it, since it is of the same essence. There is one difference in the composition of the said Corpora from Mercury, and that is their degree of purity or impurity, the impurity coming from the impure Sulphur, and which is alien and contrary to it. And Rosinus saith to Saratanta : The Materia of all metals is the boiled and imperfect Mercury, which boiled the Sulphur in the belly of the earth, and after the Su lphur hath been separated there are many metals produced in the earth, all of which have in common a single and universal original Materia , the only difference between them being that some are more and some are less affected than the others. Therefore we see daily with our own eyes how Nature taketh pains in assiduous labor to purify all metals and bring them to greater perfect ion, which is to make gold of them, that being Nature’s final intention . So we then see in all metals what Nature beginneth to produce in them: since there are no metals which do not contain a grain of silver or gold. And what is more, it is so done with the metals that Nature forthwith will and can make gold out of Mercury when it hath its Sulphur in itself, when nothing alien co meth between, and the unclean, stinking, and combustible Sulphur doth not prevent it, as we then see, in many places will be found fine and pure gold without being mixed with other metals. Because in the tunnels there commonly come th to the Mercury an alien Sulphur, which contaminateth the former and hindereth it in it s perfection, so also will be produced different metals after the matter of such alien Sulphurs. For as Aristotle , 4 Meteorologica , saith: If the substance of the Mercury is good and the combusti ble Sulphur impure, so will it turn such into copper. But when the Mercury is calculous, impu re, and earthy, and the Sulphur is alos impure, then iron will result. It appeareth as if tin had good Mercury, which is pure, but it hath bad and evil Sulphur. But lead hath crude, bad, heavy, glutinous Mercury and a bad, impalatable, and"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"stinking Sulphur, and therefore it is not easy to let it coagulate. This hindering, combustible, and stinking Su lphur is not the right fire, which doth boil the metals well, but the Merrcury hath its own Sulphur. which doth such, and as Bernhardus Count of Trevisan saith: Many believe erroneously that in the production of metals a sulphur-like materia would be added; but it is evident that in the Merc ury, when Nature worketh. is inclosed its own Sulphur: But which doth not prevail in the same, except through warm motion, through which the said Sulphur, and at the same time the other two qualities of the Mercurii , are altered. And in this manner are produced in the other different metals of the earth. For in this earth, as Arnoldus saith in the first chapter of his Rosarii , is a twofold superfluity: One is included in the innermost part of the Mercury, which hath in the beginning mixed itse lf in its essence: The other, however, is added apart from its nature, and corrupteth it. The one ca n be separated from it with great difficulty; the other, however, will be taken away by no skill of any artist. Thefefore the great heat of the fire separa teth the combustible moisture from the metals, because the Mercury holdeth that and preserveth it from cornbustion. which is its nature, but expelleth the foreign substance from itself and letteth it be destroyed by fire. But the innermost Sulphur, which boileth the Mercury and bringeth it to its perfection, is pure and impure in the same degree, combustible and non-combustible. The combustible keepeth the Mercury from its perfection, so that it should nol become gold, until this Sulphur is finally entirely separated therefrom, and constant sulphur alone remaineth the rein. Then the Mercury will become gold or silver, according as its sulphur is red or white. But this innermost sulphur is nothing else: than a timely Mercurius or the ripest and most timely part of the Merury, therefore Mercury readily receiveth it, but leaveth other and alien sulphur behind. For as Richardus , chapterr 9, saith: The better and purer the sulphur is, the more it re lisheth the good and pure Mercury and attacheth itself to it. So that one is more and more clos ely associated with the other, until more and more perfect metals are produced by this union. But such sulphur is not to be found above the earth, as saith Avicenna , except in theose two bodies, namely of gold and silver, an d much more mature in the gold. Richardus , chapter 12, saith: The red sulphur is in the gold through greater ma turing, but the white is in the silver through lesser maturing. Now if all this be so, namely: that there is a single universal Materia in all metals, which through its power with innate sulphur, either soon or otherwise, according as it separateth itself through length of time in more steady boiling fro m the alien and ineffective sulphur of the other metals, becometh gold, which is the goal of the me tals, and the perfect purpose of Nature.. Then we must indeed admit and say that Nature desireth to have, in this species as in the animal and vegetable kingdoms, its improvement and perfection through purification and subtle refinement of the subjecti in its own nature. This now, beloved seeker of the things in Natu re. would I explain somewhat more in details, that thou mayest grasp it much more thoroughly and that thou mayst understand the Materiam of our great stone. For if thou wouldst undertake to make for thyself such a stone as ours out of some animal substance, thou wouldst be thwarted, for they both belong to two different species, since the stone is mineral, but the Materia is animal. And as Richardus , chapter 1, saith: One cannot bring out of anything something that is not in it. Therefore, because every species seeketh in its own species its power of increase, and every genus or kind seeketh it in its own kind, and every nature seeketh it in its own natural natu re, and beareth fruit according to its natural characteristic, and no contrary nature: therefore every collectivity agreeth with its own seed. And Basilius Valentinus saith: Beware, my friend, and understand that thou shouldest not seek to make use of any animal soul. Like thine, their flesh an d blood, as it hath been granted and given by the Creator to the animals, belongeth to the animal s, therefore God hath at the same time ordained that an animal shall be made out of it. Therefore they are to be greatly wondered at wh o, holding themselves to be great artists, look for their Materiam Lapidis in Menstruis muliebribus , in Spermate , in eggs, hair, urine, and in many other things, and fill many books with such recipes, and also convince, deceive, and mislead other foolish folk with such worthless things. And greatly astonished at the folly of such people is Rogerius Baccho , in Speculi , chapter 3, since he saith: One should greatly marv el that a thoughtful man should base his intentions upon animal and vegetable things, which are so very widely separated, when one findeth Mineralia which are much closer."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"It is by no means to be credited that any Philosophus should have placed the art in such above-mentioned widely separated things, except it be knowingly for the sake of allegory. As Basilius Valentinus saith: Our stone doth not come forht from things that are combustible. For our stone and its Materia are safe from all danger of fire. Therefore thou mayest well abstain from searching in animal things, since Nature hath not pe rmitted it to be found in such. But if anyone would look for our stone in Vegetable things, as in tress, herbs, or flowers. he will err for the above-mentioned reasons, no less than he who would make a great rock out of an animal. For all herbs and trees, together with all that cometh out of them, is combustible, and nothing remaineth of them except a mere salt with its earth, which it hath received from Nature in the composition. And let no one be mislead because some pretend to be able to make the Philosopher’s Stone out of wine or parts thereof. For while they do not understand rightly the writings of Raymundus Lullius , they only prove with all their great knowledge tha t they do not undertand anything, and mislead both themselves and others. Of course it is also true that out of these things very splendid and excellent Menstrua could be prepared, without which in neither medicine nor alchemy could anything be undertaken or accomplished. But that the Philosopher’s Stone could be made therefrom, or its seed be extracted, was not gr anted to Nature by the Creator, but which, as mentioned above, is ordered to remain true to its kind. Therefore, everyone who hath understanding, can easily deduct and conclude that our stone, which, as said, is incombustible, must be sought and found in an incombustible Materia , which is found nowhere except in the mineral kingdom, since animal and vegetable things are all combustible. Because our previously mentioned Philosopher ’s Stone is a mineral product, one can reasonably ask out of how many kinds of minerals may the stone ultimately be made: for there are as many species as stone, among them divers ki nds of substances and earths will have been understood, salts, semi-minerals, and metals. To this I answer there is reason to believe that it is impossible to make the stone out of any of these, for the reason that there is in all of them no liquid or fusible Mercury, and that they cannot be mellcd or dissolved into their first Materium on account of the Sulphur in them, which is much too crode and has too great an abundance of Judaic qualities. No intelligent seeker of the natural secrets will seek the Materiam of the Philosopher’s Stone in salts, alums, and materials of their sort. For he will find in them nothing else tha n a sharp corroding and destroying spirit, but not the kind of Mercurium or Sulphur that the PhiIosophi want and need. But from such things can no intermediate mineral, such as Magnesia , Marcasite , Antimoninum , etc., be made. Much less will a metal come from them. How then could one obtain from them the Materiam of the Philosopher’s Stone, which is the end and perfection of all metals and mineral things? Besides. these have absolutely nothing in common nor any affinity with any metals—nay, rather, they burn, break, and corrupt them: how the n could they serve to perfect them? Hear now what Richardus Angelicus , chapter 10, saith hereon: The lesser Mineralia cannot change into any metals, in the first place because they are not born of the first Materia of all metals, which is Mercurius . But since their origin differs so greatly from the origin of Mercurii , in form and materia and at the same time in setting, no metals can come forth from them, since there has be be a first substance and seed of a like thing, from which such will be produced. But what is said appeareth clearly therefrom, that the lesser Mineralia are not produced from Mercurio , as is clear, also, according to Aristotle and Avicenna . Therefore if they should be transformed into Metalla , they would first have to be brought into their first Materiam . But since this cannot be done through any art wh atsoever, so there can never be any metals and no final Materia of its stone. Wherefore, since the lesser Mineralia cannot be in the beginning through the art, which is Mercurius , they cannot be the middle and the end of it, which are the metals and the Tincture . But the lesser Mineralia are alien to the metals in their nature, and although to some extent they have a part in the mi neral power, they are the lesser quality thereof and are combustible. Therefore the metallic nature hath no pleasure in them, but repelleth them and keepeth only what is of its own nature. Wherefore they are fools who bring forth so many and such different deceits, to deceive the people , and they do preposterous things, who neither have Nature with them, nor can they make themselves understood. And let no one be deceived by the writings of the Philosophers if at times they speak about salts, as when in Allegoriis Sapientum it was said: Whosoever laboureth without salts cannot"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"resuscitate dead bodies. And in the book Soliloquii it is written: Whoever worketh without salts shooteth with a bow without a string. But they have quite another meaning than mineral salts. As is to be seen clearly in the Rosarium Philosophorum , where it is said: The salt of the metals is the Philosopher’s Stone. For our stone is a coagulated wa ter, in gold or silver, a resisteth the fire, and can be dissolved only in its own water. Geber, in his book about the furnac e, chapter 19, teaches that the coagulated water of the philosoph es is not mineral water, but their Mercurius . saying: Apply thyself to dissolving the dry water of the sun and the moon, which the common man calleth Mercurium . The Philosophi in their parlance call it salt at times, as is to be seen in Clangore Buccinæ . where it is said: Note that the Corpora is alum and salts, which floweth out of our bodies. Also at times they call the medicine itself salt, as is written in the Scala : It is the work of the other water, that it augments the earth in its wondrous salt s, through its attracting power alone. And Arnoldus saith in his book about the preservation of you th: But that which hath not its equal in preserving youth is the salt out of the Minera . The Wise compared it, when it was prepared. to the natural warmth of a healthy youth, and also because of thi s they have called the stone by the name of an animal: others have called it a mineral Chific . and some have called it an everlasting medicine and Aquam Vitæ . The entire science of its preparation is that it should be reduced to a pure and drinkable water, with those things which have much the same qualities as it doth. Hence it is now easy to see that, according to tbe teaching of the philosophers and also the property of Nature itself, the Materia of the stone cannot be taken from the lesser minerals. Now let us look around a little and see whether the Materiam of our great stone can be made out of the semi-minerals. such as Marcasite , Antimony , Magnesia , and others, especially since the Philosophi mention this on several occasions. As when Senior saith: If there were not in our Auripigment the quality of coagulating the Mercurium , our mastery would never reach the goal. And Thomas Aquinas : Take our Antimonium or the captured black earth, etc., and Parmenides in the Turba : Take Mercury and coagulate it in the body of the Magnesiæ , or in Sulphur, which is not combustible. But here, nevertheless it is to be understood tha t the Philosophi did not so speak to indicate that our great stone could be made out of such thi ngs, but they spoke in this manner only by way of allegory. For the philosophicaJ Auripigment and Magnesia are quite another thing from those of the commoa people, namely, the Materia itself, which they call Agens , the Lion, the King, the Sulphur, and many more. names; and, what is more, it will be called Auripigment because it hath the power of gold in superfluous color, and it is called Magnesia because of its great virtue and glory, which emanateth from it. But when Thomas Aquinas calleth it Antinomium , he doth so because of its black and glittering color, which it taketh on after its dissolving. Fo r when our stone became black, it was compared to all black things by the Philosophi . Here some one might talk to us and say: Th at of these semi-minerals some were produced not only from Mercury and Sulphur , but also became metals: as one sees Magnesia or Bismuth succeed in being mixed with lead or tin. Likewise, not only doth the Antimonium mix with metaJs, but it becometh a natural lead. So also have people of low and high degree occasiona lly seen it become gold. Could one not obtain from it the Materia of the stone, since it was produced from Mercury and Sulphur, into which it can be reduced again through art, and is of one orig in with all metals? To this I anwer: First, one hast to distingusih between the semi-minerals, nameIy, between those which have by themselves a Mercurium and those which have it not. One hast to pay close attention to those which have Mercury , because. through our medicine, their Mercury can be changed into gold and silver, and therefore, as I claim. they have to be regarded as half metals, i.e. as minerals disposd to turn to metals. The others which have no Mercury are not to be considered at all. But on accoount of the bad and combustible Sulphur which is found in them, and which is the reason that the Antinomium is opposed to all metals and burneth them all except the gold. which because of its constancy it hath to leave in peace, so here one cannot come so far, one cannot select them for the Materiam of our stone, which must be pure and delic ate and incombustible Sulphur. But on close examination and testing, one can easily see that they are impure and thoroughly infected with bad Sulphur. Zinc appeareth from its brightness, weight, outer looks, and feeling, like pure Mercurium , but as soon as it cometh into fire it disssolveth into smoke, vanishing ;ole a pale yellow Sulphur. The Marcasites cannot be forced to melt at all be ause of their great earthy impurity. The Antimonium ,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"however, can be cleared of its over-great blac kness through skilIed manipulations and be brought into a white and beautiful ReguIum , and it appeareth to all as if something great could be made out of it, therefore many people, who otherwise deem themselves to be very clever. believe that the Philosopher’s Stone can be made out of it. But however much one may clear the Antimonium from its blackness, there still remaineth in it crude and inflexible Sulphur which appeareth when it doth not let itself be expanded under the hammer and become malleable, which is the quality of every metal, by which, together with other qualities, it is known to be a metal. In addition to that, it hath a crude and impure Mercurium : I do not wish to say now that it retaineth within itself at any time a dissolving Su lphur. And I hope they do not mind that I cannot agree with their point of view who call themselves great Philosophi and want to convince themselves and others in many books and widely circulated writings, that at just this point is the Scrupel of the Universal . For one seeketh foolishly for something in a thing where it is not. As Arnoldus saith: Because it is estab lished in the practice of the Turba that the Philosopher’s Stone is a pure MAteria . So also saith Lullius in his last Testament: Our Tincture is only a pure fire. And in the Vade Mecum he saith: It is the subtle Spirit alone which tingeth and thus cleareth the Corpora from their leprosy: but the Minerals , however, which are crude and impure like the other can in no way be cleansed in their innermost except by means of our Tincture : and therefore one can not obtain from them the Materiam of our stone. For Richardus , chapter 1, saith: Nothing can be taken out of a thing which is not therein. What shall one say about the Vitriol ? Through its wonderful qualities it bringeth many into error, especially since a part of it can be chang ed into copper, and it can also change iron into copper. Let it be known that Vitriol is nothing else than a beginning and Materia of copper. In the veins of the earth fire-damp and vaporous Mercurius are found in a place where in great quantity hath been found a bitter and astringent venereal Sulphur which, as soon as it was mixed therewith, hath coagulated and tried to become a metal. But because Nature wanted to separate the pure from the impure, the combustible from the incombus tible, the abundance and manifoldness of the aforementioned Sulphur have exceeded the quantitas thus far. So also in such separation the Mercurius had to separate itself and had to let itself be concealed in the vitriolic green. This can be seen clearly: that one addeth a common Sulphur to the copper is the cause of its destruction and calcineth it: for art accomplisheth with strong fires in a short time what Nature must perform with slow-burning fire. Then the copper will be entirely consumed, and bringeth this into the vitriolic order through general manipulati ons: and according as there is much or little Sulphur, the Vitriol will be richer or poorer in colors. Therefore that is the reason that some Vitriol hath more copper qualities than the other: one findeth much copper in the cyprian Vitriol, less in others. It is to be well noted chat the sour Spiritus in the Vitriol cometh from the Sulphur, especially since it can be found likewise and extracted from common SuJphur. The sulphur-like smell can be well observed in the Spiritus Vitrioli , and the Spiritus Sulphuris can change the Sulphur Martis into a Vitriol, like the Spiritus Vitrioli . But because in iron there is also a crude Sulphur, the corrosiveness of the Vitriol eateth such away, seeketh its Mercurium which is not much unlike its own, and through union of it with its Sulphur, becometh a good, malleable copper. But because there is in Vitriol such a crude, superfluous Sulphur, and because there is but very little Mercury in it, and which has not yet arri ved at its purification, we shall not get more out of it than out of the other. And we have to heed the teaching of Alphidius who saith: My son, beware, separate thyself from the dead bodies and stones: therein is no way to walk, sine their life is not being augmented but diminished, as are the Salts, Auripigments , arsenic, magnesia, marcasite, and the like. And Arnoldus. in Flore florum saith: The cause of their error is that the four spirits, namely, Auripigment , Salmiac , Mercurius , and Sulphur , are not the seed of either the perfect or the imperfect metals, with the exception of Mercury and Sulphur , which coagulateth the Mercurium . Now some one might conclude from these last words of Arnoldus , that common Sulphur and Mercury are the Materia of our stone, because such are counted among the four spirits, and because tht Sulphur coagulateth the Me rcury. Hereupon I must ask with Richardo , chapter 11: Whether every Sulphur will coagulate Mercury? To this I answer: No! For every common Sulphur, as the Philosophi say, is opposed to the metals. It is to be known that Sulphur was produced from the fat of the earth in the depths of the earth. and hath been made solid by moderate boiling, and then it is called Sulphur."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"There are two kinds of Sulphur: living and combus tible. The living Sulphur is the effectual part of the metals and when cleansed by Nature of all impurities, the Materia of our stone, but of this more later. But the common or combustible Sulphur [is not the Materia ] of metals or lapidis Materia , but their enemy. For, say Avicenna and Richardus Anglicus , tbe common and combustible Sulphur doth not befong to our masterly skill, becaus e it did not originate from it. For white as art can make it, it infecteth at all times, maketh black, and corrupteth everything made of it, for it is a destroying fire. Therefore it preventeth fluidity, when it is fix ed. The example of this we see in iron, which hath in itself a constant, crude, and impure Sulphur . But if it be burned, it becometh an earthy substance, like a dead powder. Now how could thi s give life to others? For it hath a twofold superfluity, namely one that can be set on fire, and the earthy one. Now consider the common Sulphur, not the Sulph ur of the Philosophers which is a simple, live fire, which reviveth other dead bodies. and bringeth them to maturity. Therefore common Sulphur cannot be the Materia of our stone. But what shall we say about common Mercury? Of which all Philosophi say that the Materia of our stone is a mercurial substance and hath very many qualities which will be attributed to our Mercury. For it is tbe source of everything which letteth itself be fused, as Arnoldus , Ros . lib. 2, cap. 2, saith: Every fusible thing. when it is melted, will be transformed into it, and it mixeth itself with them because it is their substance: albeit the bodiesdiffer at the same time in their composit ion from Mercury, according to their purity or impurity, and would have retained alien Su lphur. And in chapter 4 he saith: The Mercurius vivus is clear in all its effects, that most perfect and constant thing, for it withstandeth burning and causeth liquification, when it hath been fixed, and is the Tincture of a red superfluous perfection, of glittering appearance, and doth not cease from the mi xture so long as it lasteth: and it is friendly and sociable and the means of joining together the Tinctures since it letteth itself be thoroughly mixed, and adhereth to the innermsot, hence it is of their nature. There is one, and one only, which the fire conquereth, but it will not be conquer ed by the fire, yet rejoiceth in it and remaineth in it. And Bernhardus saith: Most precisely do we follow Na ture, which hath in its lodes no other Materiam wherein it operateth other than the pure mercurial form. In this Mercurius now is hidden the constant and non-combustible Sulphur, which bringeth our work to perfection, without any other substance save for the pure mercurial substanc ee. Since there are such splendid qualities in the Mercurius . must it not certainly follow that the Materia of our stone must be in this? To this we answer: That as there are two kinds of Sulphur, there are also two kinds of Mercury: the common and the phillosphicaI. The common Mercurius is still a crude, untimely and open Corpus , which cannot remain in fire like the philosophical, since through a moderate heat it is turned into smoke and will quickly vanish. Therefore the Philosophi also say in common parlance: our Mercury is not a common mercury. So Lullius also saith in his Clavicula , chapter 1. We say that the common mercury cannot be the mercury of the Philosophers, whatsoever may be the art with which it is prepared: for one cannot keep the common in fire, therefore it is done through another body mercury, which is warm, dry, and more timely. But most of the Philosophers have written according to their superfluity about the sublimation and other preparations of the commo n mercury: wherefore many queer books about this subject have come into existence, so that pe ople learned more and more about the nature and character of this subject, but the purpose they had aimed at, namely, the great treasures of earthly wisdom, no one hath as yet ever been able to find in their writings, because Nature hath not placed it therein. But in truth, it is so peculia r in its work that it would mislead one who calleth himself a Wise Man. For example, I knew one wh o had amalgamated it with gold and handled it so subtly that he brought it through all the colors unto Citrination . In this color it stood, and he, thinking he had it fixed, put some more fire under it, thinking he could not go wrong in putting fire under it after the manner of the Philosophi . Whereupon the glass burst, and the Mercurius went up the chimney, taking wi th it all the gold, gilding the chimney with it. And he had to scrape the gold out of the chimney and reduce it again. It hath also been seen that the common Mercurius as a Corpus itself can neither open another Corpus , namely the gold, nor work therein, even if many colors let themselves be perceived in it, whilst the heat worketh its effect in moisture. But had this good man realised, as many others have done, what Arnoldus saith in Flore florum , such would not have happened to him. For Arnoldus , when he discourses about such alchemis ts, saith: When they considered this more"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"subtly, they found that mercury is the origin an d soucre of all metals, and with sulphuric and boiling heat, they sublimated the Mercurius for themselves, then they fashioned it, they excluded it, and coagulated it, but when they came to the projection, they found nothing, etc. Therefore we cannot consider common mercury as the Materia for our stone. Thus far we have sought for the Materia for our stone in animals, vegetables, and in stone, in the lesser minerals, and also in the semi- and greater minerals , but we have not found it so far, and we must therefore look further, whether we can find it in me tals, and if it should be therein, whether it is in all of them at once, or only in some of them, and if so, in which they are to be found. This has long been known, and Rogerius Baco doth assert in his Speculo , chapter 3, all metals are produced out of Sulphur and Mercury. And one cannot take away or add anything to them, and cannot change them, except what cometh from them, since ever y improvement augmenteth the nature of the thing from which it cometh. As Richardus , chapter 1, saith: As it also is otherwise in all Nature, everything is ordained by the Highest Creator, so that each thing doth bring forth and bear its own kind. And as dumb animals cannot bring forth their kind to any increasc except through the nature of their own kind. so is it with everything else in Nature. Therefore Basileus Valentinus sailth: Thou art not permitted to took for the true stone, nor shalt thou undertake to make it, except out of its own seed, out of which our stone hath been made even from the beginning. To find this seed, thou must consider by thyself for what purpose thou dost want to find the stone, and then it will become obvious to to th ee that it can come only from a metallic root, from which the Creator commanded all metals to bear an d come forth. There is a great similarity between the production of metals and that of the gr eat stone, especially since there is Sulphur and Mercury in both, as well as the Salt, and the noble soul hath concealed itself, and one cannot possibly obtain the advantage of use in metallic fo rm until these three are brought together in one, after having been taken out of metallic substance, and after this nothing must be added which doth not come from there. And therefore it is plain, as Baccho saith, that no thing which hath not its origin in Mercury and Sulphur can be suffi cient to perfect them and to transform them. Therefore it is necessary for the production of the great stone that a metallic substance be taken. But whether one can find this in the imperfect metals remaineth to be seen. There are many to be found who want to find the white in lead or tin, and the red in copper or iron, or the Materia Lapidis in both: without doubt mislead by the Philosophi themselves. For thus saith Geber in Lib. Fornac ., chapter 9: As customary, the dough that is to be fermented we extract out of imperfect bodies.. And therefore we give thee a general rule: that the white dough is to be extracted from Jupiter and Saturn , but the ret from Venus , Saturn , and Mars . So also doth Basilius Valentinus , in his book about natural and supernatural things, teach that a Tincture can be made out of the Conjunction of Mars and Venus . Likewise in his Triumphal Chariot , he saith: After this followeth the Tinctura Solis et lunæ , etc. from white, then the Tinctura Vitrioli or Veneris , and likewise the Tinctura Marti s, both of which have in them the Tinctura Soli s, if they have been brought before to permanent fixation. Then followeth the Tinctura Jovis and Saturni unto the Coagulation of Mercury , and then the Tinctura Merecurii inself. Now let this be known to the investigators of natural secrets, that such hath not been the opinion of Geber and Basilis Valentinus or other Philosophers, else they would contradict themselves, which cannot be, since the Wise must always tell the truth in their writings, although they may mask the truth in concealing phrases. Fo r there can come forth perfection neither in the imperfect metals nor amongst those which are so mixed with each other that they could at least be improved. Out of those things themselves alon e such cannot come, because for our stone the purest essence of Mercury is required, as Clangor Buccinæ , Avicenna , Lullius , and in general all Philosophers say: We must choose for our Work the purest Mercurial substance. But the purest substance of Mecury is not to be found in the imperfect metals of Nature, because they are like leprous bodies, which are corrupted and rendered in active by alien and impure Sulphur, so that no kind of art can bring them to their inner an d perfect purification, and they cannot even stand fire. And it is a necessary quality of our Materia that it remain constant in fire, which does not occur here Let us now here what Geber hath to say in his Summa , chapter 63, about this impurity of the imperfect metals and the qualities of the perfect Mercury. Herein we found by true experimentation a peculiar kind of two secrets, viz. , one secret is that there are three causes for the destruction through fire of every imperfect meta l, the first of which is that their combustible"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Sulphur is inclosed in their innermost part, and is enkindled with a strong fire, lesseneth the entire substance of the bodies, transformeth them into smoke, and finally consumeth them, however excellent their Mercury may be. The second cause is that the outer flame is augmented by them, passeth through them, and dissolveth them into smoke, however dense they may be. The third casue is that their bodies may be opened through the Calcination, for then the flame of the fire can pass through them and tran sform them into smoke, however perfect they may be. Now when all these causes of destruction co me together, then necessarily the bodies will be destroyed and reduced to nothing. But when they are not together then the speed of the destruction of the bodies is less rapid. The second kind of these secrets concerneth the quality of the Mercury in these bodies. For since in Mercury the re is no cause of destruction or expulsion, it doth not separate the compound into parts, but rema ineth with its entire substance in the fire. For this reason one hath necessarily to recognise the reas on of its perfection. Let us therefore praise and give glory unto God the All-Highest, who ha th created the Mercury and given its substance, and to the substance those qualities which canno t be found in the other things of Nature, that therein the perfection may be brought about by some art, and which we find therein in its nearest power ( potentia propinqua ). For this it is that overcometh fi re and is not overcome by it, but remaineth friendly therein and rejoiceth in it. In these words Geber proveth infallibly that the Materia of our stone cannot be in the imperfect metals, because they are themstlves im pure, and if one wanted to purify them they would completely disappear therefrom. Bur our Mercurius , on account of its purity, is constant in fire and cannot be damaged by it. Now since these imperfect metals cannot be the Materia of our stone, much less can they be such when mixed together, for they become no t purer than they were before through their mixture. And in addition to this cometh another Confusion out of it, which is contrary to our intention , and only, as mentioned above, requireth a single Materia . Haly testifieth clearly to this when he saith in Lib. Secret ., chapter 9: It is a stone, and thou shalt not mix any other thing with it: with this the Wise work, and an all-healing power floweth from it. There shall be nothing else mixed with it, either in the whole nor in its parts. And Morienus saith: This masterly skill cometh in the beginning out of a root, which extendeth later into many parts and finally returned to its source. Now why have the Philosophi bidden us to work with the imperfect metals, since these cannot be the Materia of the stone? And the answer is: When the Philosophi order the impure bodies to be taken, they did not mean thereby copper, iron, lead, tin, etc., but they meant its Corpus or its earth: as Arnoldus in Flore florum saith: The Mercurius is added to the earth, i.e. to the imperfect body. And what is more, its earth in itself, however perfect and pure it can be made by nature, is still impure and imperfect respectu lapidis Physici . And herein art excelleth Nature, for it can do what Nature cannot accomplish. But since this earth, as said, is imperfect before perfect purifi cation and regeneration, it appeareth therefrom that it cannot as yet tinge and make perfect, and ha th no more than what Nature hath bestowed upon it. But when it is regenerated it may then add su ch. But its impurity is obviously perceptible in our work. At first it is wholly black, and then it will be comparable to lead or antimony, after that it becometh gray, and is called Jupiter or tin or bismuth, and all this before it turneth white. After it is white, it is called Mars and Venus before it is brought to a complete redness. Besilius Valentinus is of the same opinon, and seeketh many another, as he doth set forth in the above- mentioned book, and himself doth destify in his treatise about the great stone, where he investigateth the Materia lapidis , and saith: That in Sol the gift of all three fixites is together, and therefore resisteth every power of fire; and that Luna , on accound of its fixed Mercury doth not escape so quickly, and doth pass its Examen . And thus he saith finally: The archcourtesan Venus is clothed and dressed with superfluous colo r and her master’s body is of pure Tinctur and of the same color as abideth also in the best metals, an d on account of this superfluity is proven red. And since her body is leprous, the Tinctur has no permanent abode in it and must at the same time disappear with her body. For where the body is consumed through death, there the soul cannot remain, it must give way and escape. Because the abode is destroyed and burned with fire, so that its place is unrecognisable, and no one may continue to dwell there. But glady and with understanding dwelleth the soul in a formed body. The constant salt hath given the warlike Mars a hard, strong, and crude body, by which is proven the valor of his mind, and one cannot easily"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"wound this war-lord, since his body is invulner able. But if someone should say: Because Venus hath a constant Sulphur it must likewis e, according to the teaching of Basilius , be united to the Spiritus Mercurii perfecti , and a Tinctur will be made therefrom. What hath already been said many times, and what hat been stated by Basileus himself, should be borne in mind: That our Materia must not be taken from many tings, since the Universal is one thing, and can only be found and extracted from a single thing: and that the Spirtus Mercurii and Anima Sulphuris including the spiritual salts, are united together under one heaven and dwell in one body. So will he cease from his error and, without further consideration, turn his thoughts to the perfect metals, observing the saying of Plato , quart. 2. Why do ye calcinate and disso lve the other bodies with great difficulty, since ye can find in this (perfectly) what ye seek? But if ye ever want to use it, then it is necessary that ye first transform it into the nature of the perfect body. Therefore, my dear seeker of the Natural Secrets, leave all animal and vegetable things, all salts, alum, vitriol, marcasite, magnesia, antimo ny, all imperfect and impure metals, and seek for thy stone in Mercurius and Sol , for the gold, and in Mercurius and Luna for the silver, since this is the essence of the whole art, according to Arnoldus de Villa Nova , Rosar ., part I, chapter 7. Just as the fire in the beginning is a sealed fire, saith Riplæus , porta 1. Thus gold is also the beginning of gold-making. If, therefore, thou woudlst make gold and silver through the philosophic art, do not take for that purpose eggs or blood, but gold and silver, which engender a new birth, augmenting their kind, as do all other things when calcin ated intelligently and naturally, but not through manual work. Therefore Richardus , chapter 10, admonisheth us: That one should sow gold and silver, that through our work as the intervention of Nature, they may bear fruit: since they have it in themselves and that is what one seeketh, and no other thing in the world. And why should one not choose both of these, since, according to Richardus , chapter 12, they have a pure and perfect Mercurius within them and a red and white Sulphur? For Avicenna saith that in every gold there is a red sulphur. But such sulphur is not found on the whole earth except in these two bodies. Therefore we very subtly prepare these two Corpora , that we may obtain the Sulphur and Mercury from such Materia , as gold and silver have from between the earth. They are luminious bodies, and coloring rays are in them, which tinge other bodies in true red and white, according to their preparation. For as Arnoldus , Rosar. , lib. 1, chap. 5, saith: Our masterly skill aideth the perfect bodies and maketh perfect the imperfect ones, without a mixture of any other thing. Now, since gold is the noblest of all metals, so is the Tinctur of the redness, the coloring and transforming of every Corpus . But the silver is the Tinctur of whiteness, which coloreth all Corpora true white. Now let the good-hearted reader be informed that such metals as gold and silver are not the Materia of our stone in their metallic form: they ar e the medium between them and the one great stone. Hear therefore what Berhardus Count of Trevisan hath to say in another part of his book: They will do well to keep silent who do not produce our Tinctur , but another, which is not true, not plausible, and let those be silent who claim tha t there is another sulphur than ours hidden in the belly of Magnesia . And let those also be sile nt who want to extract an Argentum vivum from anything toerh than the ferment or red knight, and want to extract anothe r water other than our everlasting one which doth not mix with anything unless it be of its own nature, and doth not melt or dissolve anything unless it be of its own metallic nature. For there is no vinegar other than ours: no other management other than ours: no other Sublimation other than ours: no other dissolution other than ours: no other putrefaction other than ours: no other Materia other than ours. Therefore renounce the alum, salts, vitriol, and all other Arramenta , borax, strong water, and all herbs, animals, beasts, and whatever may come from them, hair, blood, urine, human seed, flesh, eggs, and mineral stones, and every metal by itself alone. Even if the beginning of our Materia is from them, it should at the same time, a ccording to all the aforesaid Philosophers, be based upon Mercury, which will be found in no other thing than metals. As appeareth from Geber , et al . But still they are not our stone as long as they are in their metallic form. For it is impossible that the one, yea, the very same Materia , could have two forms at the same time. For how could the stone, which hath a wortby and medium form, be between the metal and the Mercury, if they be not destroyed beforehand, and their metallic fo rm hath not been taken from them? Wherefore saith Raymundus Lullius in chapter 56 of his Testament : Therefore the good artist taketh the metals as mediums in the work of masterly skill, and especially doth he take Sol and Luna , and he taketh these because they have both come to a moderate un iformity and great purity of their sulphureous"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"and mercurial substances, and because they are boiled, pure, and well-times through Nature’s working, to which proportion the artist would struggle in vain if he should attempt to accomplish his purpose from the natural beginning without effective means. And furthermore he saith in his Codicil : Without these two,, namely gold and silver, the art cannot be brought to perfection, because in them is the purest substance of Sulphur, which Nature hath completely purified. In effecting this purifi cation, art is much less effective than Nature, and it could never achieve it, as hard as it might try. Our medicine can be made from these two bodies, if they are prepared with their Sulphur or Arsenicum , but not without them. And he saith in the preface to his Clavicula : I advise you, O my friends, that ye work with nothing but Sol and Luna , to reduce them again to their first Materia : namely, into our Sulphur and Mercury. For, saith Arnoldus , lib. 1, Rosar ., chapter 7, from these bodies the very white and red Sulphur will be extrac ted, because therein in the greatest quality is the purest sulphureous substance, cleansed by Nature to the highest degree. Thus saith Nicarus in the Turba Philosophorum : I bid the follower (of the Art) to take the gold that they want to increase and renew, then divide the water into two parts, and take one part in such a way that the gold is concentrated in it. For the metal, when it falleth into this water, will be called the Ferment of the gold. But why doth the Philosoph er here call the water his gold, when he saith: When the metal falleth into this water, is shall be the Ferment of the gold? Let this be known to my art-seeking followers: That the Philosopher’s gold is not ommon gold. Senior saith, and it is written in the first exercise of the Turba : As the Mercurius is the origin of all metals, so also is the sun the end and last of all metals: and all metals , whether they be pure or impure, are in their innermost Sol , Luna , and Mercurius . But one is a true sun, which is extracted from it. And therefore thou understandest the the Philosopher’s gold, although extracted from them, is a quite different gold from the common sun or gold. So also saith the Aurora consurgens , chapter 16. From this it is evident that the philosophical gold is not common gold, neither in color nor in substance. For that reason it is said that it br ingeth joy to the heart of man, and the same thing holdeth true with silver. But what is extracted fro m it is a white and a red, a true, constant, and living Tincture . But it is the philosophical gold which one should not buy cheaply, as Alphidius saith. And Morienus saith: Everything bought dearly is decci tful. For with a very small amount of this thing and with little gold we can buy much. But in addition to that, our gold is living gold and our silver living silver, which cannot bring forth anything except life and increase. The common gold and silver are dead, which cannot accomplish anything more than is granted to them by Nature, until they are awakened by a skill ed artist from their death, and obtain their life again: then they live also and can prove very effe ctive in the increase and propagation of their kind. Concerning the death of the common metals and the life of our metals, the splendid, still living Philosophus Michael Sendivogius , in the 11th Tractate of his book about the Philosopher’s Stone, speaketh thus: Thou shouldest be warned no t to take common gold and silver for they are dead: take ours. which are living. And then put them in our fire and a dry moisture will come from them. First dissolve the earth in water, called Mercurius by the. Philosophers, and the water will dissolve these Corpora Solis at Lunæ , so that only the tenth part remaineth with one part, and this is the deep-rooted moisture of the metals. Now to speak further about the gold of the Ph ilolophers. It should be known that from the earliest times the Philosophi call their water gold, also sometimes their earth. Of the first Modo the Philosophus Nicarus hath spoke above, and the Rosarius Philosophorum assetrts it in the following words: But what say ye to this, that the Philosophi say: Our gold is not a common gold, and our silver is not a common silver? To this I reply that they call water their gold, which riseth to the heights through the strength of fire: and this gold truly is no common gold. For the common man would not believe that it could rise because of its constancy. But that the Philosophi also called their earth their gold is likewise attested by Rosarius who saith: Note that the ore is the philosopher’s gold. This earth becometh ore, and is called Ferment and Tincture . Therefore saith the author who wrote Clangor Buccinæ , in the chapter about the Solution (as also Hermes saith): Sow your gold in the white and leavened earth, which is made fiery, subtle, and airy through Calcination , i.e. , Sow so much gold, which is the soul and tingeing power, in the white earth, made white and pure by due preparation, in which is no filth. From this is revealed that the gold of Nature is not the Materia fermenti , but the tingeing Ferment is the philosopher’s gold. And thus it is written in Scale Philosophoru , gradu 7: Their earth wherein their gold is sown is white, and their soul is gold, and the very same Corpus is the place of"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"wisdom, which it assembleth, and is the abode of the Tincture . And further on the author saith: For that reason Hercules saith: Pour it again, i.e. , dissolve the body of Magnesia, which hath become white and like raspberry leaves. For that body seeketh refuge in the best, and the gold extracted from it is called the gold of the philosophers, and is a Tincture , hence is a soul. For with the water the Spirtus riseth into high air, and this white Corpus , when the gold hath become white, they have call ed our gold after our blackness. Therefore Senior saith: Mix gold with gold, i. e., water with ashes. And Hermes : Sow gold In leavened earth. Therefore the Philosophi write that our gold is no common gold. To this positive opinion someone might here reply and ask: Why do the philosophers sometimes conceive of their gold as water, but at other times as earth? Doth this not look as if they contradict each other and do not agree about these matters? That they confound these things? Or do they want to mislead their followers? The answer to this is that each and all of the Philosophers, where they have shown the truth, ha ve shrouded it in hidden sayings, and therefore do not contradict each other, but agree wonderfu lly with each other, as if speaking with one mouth. They do not create any confusion, and do not seek to mislead the worthy follower, but they present to him truly and clearly, in figurative language, all their secrets before his eyes, but which they conceal and darken before the unwor thy and ungodly as much as the Highest God hath given them His mercy, so that such noble pearls will not be cast before swine, which follow their bodily desires: and thus the Holy Sanctuary will not be desecrated. So in respect to the present question the Work proveth itself. For the good-hearted follower of our art is many times sufficiently instructed, not only as to where our Materia should be obtained, but also that it is a single Materia , which, through the skill of the artist, is sdissolved into two things, viz. , into water and earth, or Mercurium and Suplhur . Now if the Philosophi call the water “gold” or the earth “gol d,” they do nothing amiss, for it is a question of their own free will how they shall name it: since they also call their stone their gold, a more than perfect gold, a regenerated gold, and ma ny more names of the kind. But not everyone can understand their meaning, as hath to be accr edited to his ignorance rather than to the ill-will of the Philosophers in writing. And now the art-seeking follower is sufficie ntly and completely informed of the super- excellent secret of the Materia of our great stone, and that it cannot be taken out of any kind of vegetable growth, or any kind of animal, out of no kind of mineral, and out of no imperfect metal, but it must be extracted from gold and silver, an d that our gold and our silver are not the common dead gold and silver, but is that of the Philosophers which is living gold and silver. Now all that there remaineth to be do ne it to be instructed about the Solution , the greatest secret of the entire work. Now to speak about the Solution : This occureth at once if one maketh something dry moist, softeneth something hard, and revealeth something hidden, i.e. , when one transformeth a hard thing into water, but not into common water, as Parmenides and Agadmoe the Philosophi teach in the Turba Philosophorum , where they say: There are some who, whe n they hear about the dissolving of the bodies, believe it is a water of the clouds. But if they had read and understood our books, they would know that our water is permanent, espe cially in the water of the Philosophers, i.e. , in the first Materia , as saith Arnoldus in Rosarium 1, chapter 9. The work of the Philosophers is that they dissolve their stone in their Mercurium , that is, they bring it again into its first Materia . And Avicenna saith: If thou wouldst work, then it is necessary that thou dost first start with the dissolving and Sublimation of the two lights, especially since this is the first step of the work, that Mercury cometh therefrom. Therefore Arnoldus , lib. 2, chapters 1 and 2, hath written: The Solution is a separating of the bodies, and preparation of the Materia or nature. And Richardus Anglicus : The beginning of our work is to dissolve the stone into its first Materia and the fusion of the body and spirit, so that it becometh a mercurial water. But just as the Solution is the first and most necessary part of our work, so it is also the most difficult part of it. Eubaldus Vogelius testifieth not badly when he saith: How difficult a work the preparing of the Solution is they know who have labored at it. And Bernhardus , Count of Trevisan , writeth in his letter to Thomas of Bononiæ : He who knoweth the art and science of the dissolving, that is, he who hath attained to the secret of the art, which is to mix the forms and extract the na tures out of the natures, which lie effectively concealed therein. Then again this Solution must not occur with caustic waters, since all caustic waters disturb and destroy tbe Corpus which they should dissolve and perfect. And in addition, as hath already been"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"said, no dissolving in the water which wetteth the hands is required, but rather a dry water, i.e. , the first Materia , which is not called Mercurius alone, but also Sulphur . Conerning this Zeumon also speaketh in the Turba : Ye do work in vain unless ye grind the Corpora , break them, dissolve them, and govern them in dustriously, until ye extract their fat and make an incomprehensible spirit from it. And thus saith Richardus Anglicus , on the advice of Avicenna : The Philosophi considered studiously in what form they should extract the Sulphur from the perfect bodies, and how they might better purify their qualities through their art, so that such a thing might come out of it with the aid of Nature as no one had seen in them before, and they say that this couId not be done without the dissolving of the bodies and returning them to the first Materia could never occur, which is nothing else than the Mercury out of which they had been made before, and it is this Mercury alone, without mixture or addition of any alien substance. For our Corpora are not dissolved by any waters, except that of their own kind, which can be thickened by the bodies, as saith Bernhardus in his epistle to Thomas of Bononiæ . And a little before in the same epistle, he saith: The dissolving requireth a remaining together, name ly that of the dissolving and the dissolved, that out of both the male and female seed come forth in a new form. I tell thee in all truth that no water dissolveth the metallic form through natu ral Reduction except that which remaineth with them in the Materia and Forma, and that which can again coagulate the dissolved metals. And Morfoleus saith in the Turba : Every Corpus will be dissolved by the spirit with which it is mixed, and will become, undoubtedly, spiritually one with it, and each spirit will be changed and colored by the bodies, with which spirit a tingei ng and the fire-witstanding color is mixed. Now, if all this be true, then the Discipulus , seeking the art, hath only to reflect diligently upon what kind of water it is, since he hath to strive for the knowledge of the M enstruum , whose things are one, and without which nothing can be a ccomplished in the Mastery of this art, as saith Raymundus in Compendio animæ . For there is nothing in the world but our Menstruum , he saith in his Codicillo , which can join together the dissolution of the metals: since it is such a water that the metals, retaining their forms, can be dissolved with it. But while this is the great secret, which the Philosophi have kept most deeply hidden in their writings, but have also forbidden it to be revealed, I shall direct thee (so far as I am permitted to do so), to the right way with two philosophical dicta. The first is found in the book Rosarii abbreviati in the following words: The first preparation and the Fundament of the art is the dissolving, that is, the restoration of the body in water, i.e. , Mercury. And they called this the dissolving when they said: The gold, which is hidden in the body of Magnesia, is being dissolved, that it might be brought back into its first Materia . therein to become Sulphur and Mercury. not to be turned again into water, since our Solution is none other than the body moistened again and dissolved again into the nature of Mercury. An d the salty content of its Sulphur is decreased, which holy Sulphur is extracted from two Sulphurs when the spirit meeteth the body. The other dictum is to be found in Ripley’s preface to his Twelve Gates : I will instruct thee in Truth that ye may undertand that there are three Mercurii , which are the keys to knowledge, and which Raymundus hath called his Menstruum , and without which nothing can be made rightly. But two of them again differ, and are not the bodi es own nature. But the third is the essential Mercurius of Sol and Luna , the quality of which I sha ll explain to thee. For the Mercurius , essential in the other metals, is the principal Materia of our stone. In Sun and Moon are our Menstrua , not to be seen with our eyes except through their effects. This is our stone, when some one rightly un derstandeth our writings. It is the soul and radiant substance of the Sun and the Mon, and the very subtle Influentia through which the earth receiveth its light. For what else is gold and silver, saith Avicenna , but the pure white and red earth? Take the above-mentioned light from them and they will become earth of very little value. When everything is compounded together we call it lead. The very existence of the quality of light originateth from the Suna dn the Moon: and these are the Summa of our Menstrua . We calcinate the perfect Corpora with the first according to Nature: but no impure Corpus will be added thereto except the one commonly called by the Philosophers the “Green Lion,” which is the means for joining together the Tinctures between the Sun and the Moon with perfection. With the other, which is a vegetable moisture, which bringeth to life that which had been dead before, both material elements as well as the form al ones, should be dissolved, otherwise they are of little value. "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"With the third, the tree Hermetis must be burned to ashes with a certain lasting humidity, incombustible and greasy is its nature. This is our surest natural fire, our Mercurius , Sulphur, our pure Tincture , our soul, our stone, lifted up by the wind, born in the earth. Keep this well in thine heart. This may I say to thee: that this stone is a potential vapor of the Sulphur, but thou must be careful how thou dost obtain it, for this Menstruum is in fact invisble, although it can stil take the form and appearance of a clear water through the help of the other philosophical water, when the elements are separated. And by very hard and strenuous work with this Menstruum the Sulphur Naturæ can be made, when it hath been intensified in a natural way and hath been calcinated into a pure spirit. Then thou canst dissolve with it thy Basis or Mass . Now these are the words of the Philosopher wherein the whole secret of the SoIution is disclosed. Now if thou dost want to hold fast to and ponder over all the potentialities of Nature, so that thou perform all the works which Natu re performeth, then thou must recall and unwind like a ball of twine, what thou wilt find herein of truth, clearly and profoundly set forth. But if thou canst fail to note herein where the lo cked doors are, then thou knowest neither the Materia nor the power of Nature. and for this thou wilt not need any spectacles nor an imaginary putebam , but a most fervent prayer; and assiduous study, in addition to contemplation of the possibilities of Nature, will expedite thee. I have acquired my knowledge solely and alone, after the revelation of the High and Great God, from the assiduous study and oft-repeated read ing of good books: I do not say explicitly that I have learned about the Materia therein, which l could learn only from divine revelation, but what I learned confirmed and conformed thereto, also about the Solution , which with all Philosophers is but one, and without which neither the old nor the new Philosophers can accomplish anything. Therefore it is called also Secretum Artis and Arcanum Philosophorum, quod nemo nisi Deus revelare debet , including all work. and for this I thank the Creator of all things, giving unto Him praise, honor, and glory, now and for ever. Amen But thou, dear reader, must have no reason to complain about me, and therefore I will reveal to thee, through the love of God, still an other secret. And thou shalt know that this Solution , although one, is divided into a secundum prius et posterius , as they take care to say in the schools. The first is the dissolution of which Arnoldus speaketh, or the decomposition into its first Materia , but the other is the complete dissolving of th e body and the spirit at the same time, since the dissolving and the dissolved always remain to gether, and together with this dissolving of the body ocurreth the Coagulation of the spirit. Here thou canst see quite clearly and plainly with thine own eyes all that thou dost desire to see an d know: and it is only a woman’s work and a child’s play, because one has so little difficulty therew ith, whereof there is no need to speak further; since whoever knoweth the beginning, knoweth also how, by God’s blessing, to attain the end, which, so to speak, pictureth to us all the glory, all the eternal glory, when we shall behold God in our transfigured bodies. Hence we scorn all earthly lusts and strive only for the eternal, infinite, and unspeakable delights, which, all beautiful, we shalls ee with our own eyes. Herewith I shall now close this short Treatise , and set clearly before thine eyes, in the following parable, what is further necessary for th ee to know, without lack or error. And in this parable thou wilt find the whole Practica and if thou but follow it dilige ntly, thou wilt arrive at the final end and true knowledge. To that end maye st thou and all of us be helped and preserved from want by God the Father, God the Son, and Go d the Holy Ghost to Whom be highest praise for ever and ever. Amen.

O NCE UPON A TIME I went walking in a beautiful green and young wood and meditated upon and deplored the hardships of this life and upon how we came, through the troublesome fall of our first parents into such misery and distress. Th us thinking, I left the common path and I came, I know not how, upon a narrow footpath, very rough, untrodden, and hard to walk upon, overgrown with many bushes and shrubs, and it was easy to see that this trail had been little used. Thereupon I became frightened and wanted to turn around and go back, but it was not within my power, especially since a strong wind blew mig htily behind me, so that I had to take ten steps ahead for every one I could take backwards. Therefore I had to continue on the trail despite its roughness. Now after I had walked for some length of time , I came to a lovely meadow. :surrounded by beautiful fruitful trees. as in a circle. This meadow was called by the inhabitants Bratum felicitatis . There I met with a group of old men with snow-w hite beards save for one young man with a pointed black beard: and among them was one whose name I knew, and who was still younger, but I could not see his face. And they had a grea t dispute about all kinds of things, especially about a high and great secret which was hidden in Nature and which God kept hidden from the great world, revealing it only to those few who loved Him. I listened to them for a long time, and I liked their discourse very much, but some of them seemed to maunder absurdly, not indeed about the Materia or the work in question, but about the Parabolæ , Similitudes and other Parergons . Therein they followed Aristotle , Pliny , and other Figmenta , each of whom had copied from the other. Here I could no longer contain myself, but put in mine own word, refuting ma ny futile things out of my Experienta , and there were many who gave heed to me, examining me intheir Faculty , putting me through some ve ry hard tests. But my foundation was so good that I came through with all honors, and they wondered a great deal about it, but unanimously took me into their Collegium , for which I was heartily glad. But they said I could not be a real Collega until I first learned to know their Lion and knew fully what he could and would do internally as well as externally. Therefore I should apply myself diligently to making him submissive to myself. I was rather sure of myself, and promised them that I would do my best. For I enjoyed the ir company so much that I would not have parted with them for any amount of money. They led me to the Lion and described him to me very carefully. But what I should do with the beast in the beginning no one would tell me. Some of them gave me hints thereon, but so"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"confusedly that not one in a thousand could underst and them, and after I had tied had tied up the lion and made sure that his sharp claws and pointed teeth could not harm me, they no longer kept anything secret from me. The lion was very old, ferocious, and big, and his yellow mane hung over his neck, and he seemed unco nquerable, and on account of my Temerity I was almost terrified, and I would glady have turned back bu t for my agreement, and the old men stood all around me to see how I would begin, which also kept me. With good confidence I went up to the lion in his den, and began to cajole him, but he glared at me so intensely with his flittering eyes that out of fear I nearly let my water. At the same time I recalled having heard from an old man on our way to the lion’s den that very many peo ple had undertaken to conquer this lion, but very few had really done so. I did not want to come to grief, and I remembered many a grip 1 had learned through great diligence in athletic s. and besides I was well versed in natural Magia , so that I forgot about the cajoling, and attacked the lion so fast, artfully, and subtly that I pressed the blood from his body, even out of his heart: it was beautifully red, but very choleric, and this I did before he even realised it. But I looked furthe r into his anatomy and found many things about which I had to wonder greatly, especially his bo nes which were as white as snow and there were more of them than of his blood. When my dear old men, standing around the den and watching me, became aware of what I had done they began to dispute with each other vehemently. but I could not hear what they said because I was still so deep in the den, and I could only see their gestures. But when they began to utter hard words to each other, I heard one who sa id: He must revive the lion also, else he cannot be our Collega . I did not intend to raise difficulties, left the den, went across a great square and came, I know not how, to a great wall, the height of which was over 100 ells against the clouds, but it did not have the width of a shoe, and from the beginning of the wall where I started unto the end, there ran on top of it an iron rail well se cured with many supports. On top of this wall I walked and thought I noticed someone going a few paces ahead of me on the right side of the rail. After following that person for some time, I no ticed someone following me on the other side of the rail, and I still doubted whether it was a man or a woman who called me and said it would be better to walk on his side than where I was go ing, and I believed it readily, for the hand-rail which thus stood in the middle made the walk very narrow and it was hard to walk on such a height. And then I saw some people behind me who wanted to go that way. Therefore I swung myself under the rail. grasping it tightly with both hands, and I continued on the other side until I came finally to a place on that wall which was dangerous to descend. Then I regretted that I had not stayed on the other side. for I could not pass un der the rail again. and it was also impossible for me to turn back and take the: other way agai n. Therefore I took a chance, trusted my good feet, held on tightly, and came down without ha rm. And when I had walked on for some time. I had forgotten about danger and also did not know what became of the wall and hand-rail. But after I had thus come down, there stood a beautiful rosebush, on which grew beautiful white and red roses, but more red than white ones , some of which I broke off and put upon my hat. Whereupon I was awan: of a wall enclosing a great garden. and in the garden were young fellows, and where the maidens would have liked to be, but who did not like to make so great an effort as to walk around that wall in order to come to the door. I was sorry for them and went back the way I had come, then upon a more leve l way. and I went so fast that I soon reached several houses, where I thought to find the house of the gardener. There I found many people, each of whom had his own chamber, and two were working together slowly and diligently. But each had his own work. 1 thought I had done a ll this work which they were doing before them, and I knew all their work, and I thought: Look, since so many other pcople do such squalid and dirty work only for the appearance of it an d according to their own notion, having no Fundament in Nature, then thou art thyself forgiven. Therefor e I did not wanl to remain any longer, because I knew that such art would disapppear in smoke, and I continued on my planned way. As I now went toward the garden door, some peo ple looked at me sourly. so that I feared lest they hinder me in my Propositio . But others said: See, he wanteth to go into the garden, and we who for so long a time did services for the garden ha ve never entered it. Let us jeer at him, if he: doth blunder. But I did not pay attention to them, for I knew better than they the situation of the garden, although I had never been in it, and I we nt right up to a door that was locked tightly. where one could not find even a key-hole from outside. But I noticed a small round hole in this doorr which one could not see with common eyes, and I thought it was necessarty to open the doot there. I took out my master-key , prepared for this occasion, unlocked tbe door, and entered."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"After I was inside, I found some more Iocked doors, but I opened all of them without much trouble. But this was a passageway. as if it we re in a well-constructed house, about six shoes wide, and twenty long. covered with a ceiling. And although the other doors were still locked, I could see through them sufficiently into the garden as soon as the first door was opened. In God’s Name I walked further on in the garden , and found in the midst of it a little garden, square in shape, and measuring six rods on each of its sides. It was covered with briar-rosebushes, and the roses thereon blossomed very beautifully. And since it had rained a little and the sun was shining. there was a beautiful rainbow. When I had left the little garden and had arrived at the place where I should assist the maidens, I noti ced that instead of the walls there stood a low wattled fence, and a most beautiful maiden, bedeck ed in white satin, with a most splendid youth, went past the rose-garden, one leading the other by the arm and carrying many fragrant roses in their hands. I spoke to them and asked then: Ho w did they come over the fence? She said: My dearest bridegroom helped me over it, and we ar e now going out of this lovely garden into our chamber to enjoy our friendship. I said: I am pleased that you can satisfy your desire without any further effort on mine. But see, how I ran so long a way in so short a time, only to serve you. After this I came to a great mill, built inside of st ones. In it were not flour bins nor any other things necessary for milling, and one did not even see any waterwheels turning. I asked how all this came about, and the old miller answered me , saying that the milling-machinery was locked up on the other side, and I saw the miller’s serva nt go in to it on the covered passage-way, and I followed him. But when I stood in the passage and beheld the water-wheels on my left side, I stood still, marvelling greatly at what I saw. For now the wheels were above the passage, the water was as black as coal, and the drops there from were white, and the passage was not more that three fingers wide. Nevertheless I risked going back, holding on to the logs which were over the passage, and came over the water unwetted. Then I asked the old miller how many water- wheels he had. Ten, he answered. I could no t forget this adventure and I would have liked to know its meaning. When I saw that the miller di d not want to reveal anything, I departed, and there was in front of the mill a high paved hill, and on top of it some of the above-mentioned old men, walking in the warm sunshine, and they held a letter in their hands, written by the entire Faculty and addressed to them, about which they took counsel. I soon noticed what it might contain and that it might concern me, therefore I we nt up to them and said: Sirs, is it about me? Yes, they answered, you have to keep the wife yo u married a short time ago, in wedlock, or we have to report it to our Prince. I answered: This will be very easy, for I was, so to speak, almost born with her and raised together with her from ch ildhood, and because I had once taken her, I shall keep her always, and even death itself shall not part us, for I love her with all my heart. They replied: What then have we to complain about? the bride is also happoy, and we know what she doth want: ye must be joined togethe r. I am well satisfied, I answered. Well, said one of them, then will the lion also come back to life and be mightier and more powerful than before. Then I recalled my previous exertion and wo rk, and for some strange reason I thought that all this did not concern me, but some one whom I knew well. And thus thinking, I saw our bridegroom with his bride in their above-mention ed garments, going away, ready and prepared to be joined together, which pleased me greatly. For I had been in great fear, lest these things might concern me. Now when, as said, our bridegroom in his br illiant scarlet clothes came to the old men with his beloved bride whose white satin frock radiated in very bright rays, they were both soon joined together, and I marvelled not a little that this mai den, who might still be her bridegroom’s mother, was yet so young that she seemed to have been born but recently. Now I do not know wherein these two had sinn ed: it may be that they, being brother and sister and bound together in such a way that tey we re not to be separated, had been accused of incest. Instead of a bridal bed and true marriage, they were condemned and locked up in a strong and everlasting prison, to repent and pay for their evil deeds with everlasting tears and true regret. But because of their noble birth and ra nk, and in order that they might not do anythIng secretly any more, and that they might be alwa ys beore the eyes of the watchman who was ordered to take care of them, their prison was transparent, crystalline. and formed not unlike a heavenly dome. But before this, all their cl othes and ornaments with which they were adorned were taken from them. so that they had to live na ked and bare in their dwelling-place. And no one was given them to wait upon them. But a ll the food and drink which was drawn from the above-mentioned water, which was necessary for them was placed therein. The door of their"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"chamber was well locked and sealed with the seal of the Faculty , and I was ordered to guard it and since winter was soon to come, to heat their cham ber duly, so that they should not freeze or burn, but in such a way that they could in no wise co me out and escape. But if any damage should occur under the said Mandatum , I would certainly receive great an d severe punishment therefor. I did not feel well about this matter, and my fear and worry made me faint-hearted. For I thought to myself that it was not a small work which I was commanded to do, but I knew that the Collegium Sapientiæ was not given to lying and always did what it said, and certainly prepared its work with care. However, I could not change it, and besides this locked chamber stood in the middle of a strong tower, surrounded by high walls and strong fortifications, and since one could heat the chamber with a moderate but constant fire , I undertook my office and began In God’s Name to heat the chamber in order to protect the imprisoned married couple from tbe cold. But what happen? As soon as they notice the slighte st warmth, they embrace each other so loviningly that one will not see the like again. And they stay together in such ardor that the heart of the young bridegroom vanished in fervent love, and hi s entire body melted and fell apart in the arms of his beloved. Then she, who had loved hi m no less than he had loved her, saw what had happened, she shed many tears for him and buried hi m, so to speak, with them, so that one could not see for overflowing tears what had happened to him. But her grieving and crying lasted only for a short time, and because of her grief she di d not want to live any longer, but went voluntarily to her death. Ah! woe unto me! I was in fear, anguish, and misery, because these two whom I was supposed to guard had been apparently dissolved enti rely into water, and I saw them lying before me as dead. Certain failure confronted me, an d what seemed to be the worst and what I feared most, was the coming derision and ridicule, as well as the perils I should have to meet. I spent a few days in careful thought, consi dering how I could help mine affairs, when I recalled how Medea had brought Æson’s dead body to life again. And I thought to myself: If Medea could do it, why should I not be able to do it. I began to think about how to proceed with it, but did not find any better way than to mai ntain the steady warmth until the water would recede and I could view the dead bodies of our lover. Then I hoped to escape all danger with gain and praise. Therefore I continued for forty days with the warmth with which I had begun, when I noticed that the longer I did so the more the wa ter disappeared. And I could see the dead bodies, black as coal. This would have happened sooner if the chamber had not been locked and sealed so tightly; but I was not permitted to enter it in an y way. Then I noticed quite particulary that the water rose up high toward the clouds, collected on the ceiling of the chamber, and came down again like rain; and nothing could escape, so that our bridegroom and his lovely bride lay before mine eyes dead and rotten, stinking beyond all measure. Meanwhile I noticed in the chamber a rainbow in the most beautiful colors, caused by the sunshine in the moist weather which gladdened me not a little in my sorrows, and I be came rather happy to see the two lovers lying before me again. But no joy is so great that there is no sorrow in it; and therefore I was grieved in my joy because I saw the ones I was suppoed to gu ard so lying before me that one could perceive no life in them. But since their chamber was made from such firm and pure Materia and closed so tightly, I knew that the soul and spirit could no t escape therefrom, but were still enclosed therein. I continued with my steady warmth and heat day and night, performing my ordered duty, imagining that spirit and soul would not return to the bodies as long as the dampness lasted. For they like to dwell in the damp nature. And, in deed, I found this true. For I noticed in many painstaking observations that many vapors ar ose from the earth about eventide, through the strength of the sun, and went up high as if the sun were drawing up the water. But during the night they coagulated into a lovely and fertile dew , coming down in the morning, moistening the earth, and washing our dead bodies, which became all the more white and beautiful through such bathing and washing. But the more beautiful an d white they became, the more they lost of their moisture, until finally the air became so light an d clear, while all of the foggy and damp weather had passed, the spirit and soul of the bride could not remain any longer in the clear air and went back into the transfigured and glorified body of the queen, and as soon as the body felt them it became instantaneously alive. Over this I rejo iced not a little, as you can very well imagine, especially since I saw her rise in a very costly ga rment, the like of which is seen by only a small number of people on this earth, and she wa s adorned with a costly crown embellished with flawless diamonds, and I could see her rise and sa y: Hearken, children of men, and observe ye who are born from women, that the All-Highest hath the power to enthrone kings and dethrone them. He maketh rich and poor, according to His will. He slayeth and maketh to live again."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"And behold all this in me as a true and livin g example: I was great and became small; but now after I became humble I was raised to be a queen over many realms. I was slain and made alive again. The great treasures of the philosophers and of the mighty bave been entrust:e and gjven to me, the poor one. Therefore was I granted the power to make the p oor rich, to deal mercy to the humble, and to bring health to the sick. But not yet am I like my beloved brother, the great and mighty king, who will still be recalled from the dead. When he cometh he will prove my saying true. And while she thus spake, the sun shone brightl y and the days became warmer and the dog- days were soon to come. And long before the wedding of our new queen there were prepared many costly robes, made out of black velvet, as h-gray colored damask, gray silk, silver-colored taffeta, snow white satin, yea, a silver piece of exceeding beauty, embroidered with costly pearls and bedecked with gloriously clear glittering di amonds. And in the same manner were prepared garments for the young king, namely of Incarnat , with the yellow colors of aureolin, costly fabrics, and finally a red velvet garment, embroidered, adorned, and prepared with costly rubies and carbuncles in very great quantities. But the tailo rs who made these garments were invisible, and I marvelled greatly when I saw one coat after anothe r, and one robe after another, being finished, since I knew that no one else besides the bridegr oom and the bride had gone into the chamber. But what most astonished me was that as soon as one coat or robe was ready, the former ones disappeared before my very eyes, and I did no t know whither they had vanisbed nor who had locked them away. And after this costly coat was finished, there appeared tbe great and mighty king in all his power and glory. and there was nothing like unto him. And when he found himself locked in, he asked me in a friendly way, with gracious words, to open the door for him, so that be would be able to go out. and said it would be to mine advantage. And although I was strictly forbidden to open the chamber, I was so terrified by the great appearance and the sweet power of persuasion of the king that I opened the door willingly. And wh en he left he showed himself very friendly and gracious, yet humble, so that one could truly see that notbing adorns persons of noble birth as much as these virtues. And since he had spent the dog-days in great he at, he was very thirsty, weak, and tired, and he asked me to bring him some of the running water from below under tbe water-wheels of the mill. This I did. and after he had drunk a great part of it eagerly, he went back into his chamber and told me to lock the door fast behind him, lest some one should disturb him or awaken him from his slumber. There he rested for several days, and then called me to open the door. But I observed that he had become far more beautiful, full-blooded, and gl orious, and he also noticed it. Whereupon he thought it must have been a marvellous and heal thy water, and he ordered more of it and drank much more of it than the first time. And I reso lved to build the chamber much larger. After the king had drunk of this delicious beverage, which the ignorant do not value at all, to his heart’s content, he became so beautiful and glorious tha t in all my life I never beheld a person more glorious or more noble in behavior and characte r. Thereupon he led me into his kingdom and showed me all the treasure and riches of tbe worl d. so that I have to admit that not only did the queen speak the truth, but he also gave a great pu t of it to those who know the treasure and can describe it. There was no end of gold and prec ious carbuncle-stones, and the rejuvenation and restoration of the natural powers, as well as restor ation of lost health and the taking away of all diseases, was a common thing there. But what was most delightful in this kingdom was the inhabitants knew, feared, and praised their Creator, obtaining from Him their wisdom and knowledge, and finally, after this earthly joy, they obtained eternal glory. To this end may God, Father, Son and Holy Ghost help all of us. AMEN. "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The Star of the Kings from the Orient.

Mundi fundum laborando crede mihi unde beari ColumbÊ Aves ∆neidi si profundum in veneris habes totum poteris The dew of the heaven and the fat of the earth is our art-sub jectum or Materia. Consequently it is neither mineral nor metal; the Pythagorean indicates to us that there are two mercurial substances of one root: Fire and water, Isch- schamain, namely, drawn out of Minera, wherein all metal and minerals are situated. It is a dew of heaven G , but a mineral and metallic dew of heaven, in which are all the colors in the world, which may be coagulated through artificial operations into a sweet salt, called Manna, into a medicine; So l pater, Luna Mater, from both these it receives its light, life and splendor, its fiery light-essence from the Sun, from the Luna its watery light-essence. We find it coagulated and dissolved. This dew falls from above into the depths of the e arth and its body is made up fr om the most subtle parts of the earth. From above this dew receives its soul, and spirit; fire and light go into its salty body, receiving the powers of the things from above and below (nempe Vi rtutes Substantiales). To our eyes appears this mineral-dew in white, yellow, green, red and black colors, these being the only colors visible to our outer eyes. For it appears corporeally to the outer eyes, at times seen by miners in the mountains, appearing to the outer eye, heavy, watery, and dripping. Neither the miners nor artists know to what use to put it, since they do not know for what purpose Nature placed it there, nor of what sex it is, nor whether it be mineral or metal; all this is incomprehensible and unrecognisable. The best dew is that which in color looks like coagulated electrum or transparent amber. What the world uses it for I do not know, yet it is with all its power in all things. The dew itself is always rejected and despised; it separates into two branches, white and red, from a single-rooted Y , and stands upon this single root, growing like a white and red Rose of Jericho and blossoms like a lily in the valley of Josaphat, oft-times broken off untimely by miners and is tortured by ignorant workmen. The true artist knows its influence, and plucks it in full bloom, with blossom, seed, root, stem and branches, namely: in full bloom, through the faith of the inner opened eyes. This is enough said of its bodily form: It is neither metal nor mineral, but nevertheless first mother and materia of all metals and minerals. It is nothing but a Lion with its coagulat ed blood, and the gluten of the white eagle. Whoever seeks it, suffer Whoever finds it, be silent. Whoever holds it, hide it, Whoever may use it, do so unbeknown, Whoever is a true Philosophus, Remain nameless, Trust no one but God, For He alone keeps His vow, Seek for friends in your mind, Be friendly with everybody, But trust no one, No one but God, If you do not want to be cheated.

On its shore lies a boat at anchor, great to look upon, bedecked with blue velvet. Its master and his servents wear crimson red mantles. Not far fr om its springs forth a fresh clear fountain, nearby is a pyra- mid and obelisk on which are written the customs of this strange island in 72 languages. If one wants to reach the prince- ly castle, and discover it, one has first to pass through a ru ined tower called the uncertain passage, from there one can view and estimate the places in the sinist er and as yet invisible castle; then one comes to another tower, called the danger- ous one, through which one must pass on foot, then one reaches the rock, on whic h the water beats, and if one touches the Sceptre thereon with the middle-finger, and conquers the wolf and a goat, which will appear suddenly, then will appear a very beautiful virgin, who will give the victor a wreath, signif ying his virtue and bravery.

Dear Christian brethren: As Jesus Christ, the Son of God will be revealed by the Holy Ghost through His Father and the Father was revealed through His Son, so it will come to pass that those who are seemingly Christians will become Christian and all the people will accept the Christian belief and will become Christian men. But so far, as one can easily see, Christ and Christianity have never been revealed, for until now love towards the neighbor and towards God hath been entirely closed up and hath been extinguished and instead of it, rules the Flesh; i.e. idolatry, whoring, drinking, eating, envy, wrath, contestation, dissension, murder, rob- bery, injustice and all luxury and ambition, all this being contrary to the Revelation of Jesus Christ and His bodily rebirth. Woe upon us, wretched men, that we are so much opposed to one another! Why do we fight each other with claws and teeth, is it that the love poured out by the Holy Ghost is entirely extinguished and dead? Does no one longer repsect the other man? Are we like the dumb beasts that one hath to rend, devour and destroy the other, was heaven and the earth made for one man alone? Nay, that cannot be. O, ye nobles, counts and knights, do we have to pray to God, our Creator, for the revelation and know- ledge of Jesus Christ, His Son, who is despised and ridiculed, and who is nevertheless the greatest in heaven and on earth? O, ye Theologicans, Preachers including all Teachers: Ye should be taught by God and ye should proclaim Jesus Christ of Nazareth, the Crucified, to all people with right knowledge and teaching and should do so out of love and not for money or motives of profit. It is also necessary for you to ask Almighty God for the revelation and right knowledge of Jesus Christ, the Son of God and the Virgin. So then you may go ahead as the true lights of this world, before men as you have your illumination from God. Learn to know Jesus Christ, who hath made us for wisdom, for justice, for holiness, and for salvation, so that as it is written: He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. I. Cor. 1. v. 31. So there will soon cease fighting, quarreling, dam- nation and heresy and there will be only brotherly love and unity amongst you, with the friendliness of one mind, one will, one knowledge, one belief, one blessedness and a perfect love towards neighbor and God. O, all ye people in this world, rich and poor, man and woman, young and old, great and small, let us pray God for the revelation and true knowledge of His Son, Jesus Christ, that we may live in unity, peace, friendship, patience, kindness, and humbleness of heart, that all men in this entire world may live as of one heart, one love, one community, one church, one faith and in one mind in Jesus Christ in whom we and all men shall be blessed. Otherwise we do not know Jesus Christ, who died for us on the cross, and no one should glorify Him with his mouth only, for He looketh into the heart, and where there is love, injustice will cease from all things, which are done in the world. O, ye people, loving lovingly, love of all loves, how easy is thy yoke and how light is thy burden! Thus speaketh the heavenly and eternal Wisdom and Love Itself. Matth. 11. John 3.

All those made white in the bitterness of this time limited life were reborn through Him into the sweetness of eternal life. His soul is the essential thing in my soul, and for that Soul's sake god hath become man, that we may become God-like in and through Him in the love and life of Jesus Christ. So that we may be reborn and revealed in the eternal heav-enly image into a divine life. O Man: It is a great unfathomed Secret when we come to consider it and remember that we are in Christ members of one body and all of us are in Him but One. That all of us receive and benefit from the One Christ and that we are an remain in the same Christ a unified body, which body is He Himself. And we are the body and the members thereof. Yes, we are tied and bound together with and in Him to One Man, and this Man is each sev-erally in Christ. Through the medium of bread and wine we all eat and drink Christ's body and blood with the Essential desire and desirous believing mouth, the fiery love and life mouth of our souls. The real innermost man, a creature of paradise and of eternity, an image of God, is hidden under the gross animal form, and desired a spiritual nutriment or Tinctur and therefore eats Christ's spiritual flesh and blood, for he is a spiritual being. The soul's hunger for the true belief is the divine spiritual mouth, eating and drinking, in the innermost depths of the soul, Christ's Body and Blood. Whatever cometh from the Spirit and consists of the Spirit, that is the greatest and high-est nutriment of the souls. The spiritual hungry fire of the soul reaches for, grasps, eats and drinks with its spiritual, opened, believing mouth the holy inconceivable being, Christ's Flesh and Blood. It takes this supernatural holy essential power through the medium of bread and wine, through which medium the invisible eternal becomes one with the visible, spiritual, immortal eternal human being; understand: Faith becomes through this transformation a being, a spiritual flesh and blood. For one faith can grasp the other: The earnest faith of the living grasps for the eternal: And is so mighty and powerful that it can overthrown the mountains and move them elsewhere. The true and essential faith of man is Christ Himself, who is in him and abideth in him and is his life and light. Behold, this is the way we are being purified through the faith and enlightened and inspired through the Holy Ghost. The gross animal, which is only the outer shell, receiveth only an elemental being or earthly food and eats of the perishable world-being out of which he himself consists. But the soul is of God and of His words. Mark: As is the mouth, so aslo is the food: Ever Principium eats and drinks of its likeness: Every spirit eats and drinks of that from which it came forth, and in whose depths or Centrum it standeth: For what hath light in common with darkness? It cannot comprehend it. The natural, mortal and perishable body receives its food from the earth: and the sidereal, volatile and perishable body its food from the firmament: but the Spirit of the Lord is the life of souls and the life of the innermost immortal life. The innermost man as the pure Adamic power-body, with his beautiful, chosen, gracious, heavenly bride, receives in great love, desire in his spiritual believing mouth the invisible spiritual being and supernatural heavenly flesh of Christ, a tincture of life, a perpetrating fiery love and power being, for faith is the cornerstone, the beginner and the finisher, effecting the right innermost, eternal Sabath in the innermost depths of our souls, effecting, also, the power of God through the love of Jesus in quiet tranquility and peaceful bliss. Christ hath not given unto His disciples the creaturely being, the outer understandable fleshy human nature, nay: Whosoever discerneth not the body of the Lord and eateth and drinketh the bread and wine, receiveth Him unto his con- demnation. He gave them the spiritual human nature, the power of His body and blood, a holy, heavenly body life and loveliness, a spiritual being a spiritual body. This He brought down from heaven in which is understood the divine and eternal human power: This He introduceth into our body, made white by the light, so that He maketh us live again through His heavenly existence in our bodies. No mortal creature can look upon a spiritual being, much less can we grasp, handle and enjoy it with our earthly mor- tal mouth. But such is conceivable and comprehensible to the spirit of the souls standing in the divine Centro, for He, Christ, is the body of the spirit and the spirit of the body, in our soul's body which He giveth unto us to eat in faith. No mortal and unworthy man can reach and receive the unchangeable and indestructible heavenly bread of eternity, much less can he taste of it.

If thou knowest me, keep silence. A prophet is without honor in his own land The created PRIMUM Fiat moved upon the face of the waters. So must be my Laborant. Who will come into my land: Simple, true, pious and just. Else my hangman shall he become. Whoever doth not want this name must Ask my forgiveness and say: Amen. Hide my treasure, make it not public. Unless he proveth his teachings with miracles. finite MOBILE. Lux"}]
