This monograph is the first of those you will recei ve as a member of the Postulant Section. This section, as its name indica tes, is composed of fratres and sorores who, like you, aspire to receive the Kn owledge perpetuated by the Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis; yet su ch Knowledge can only be transmitted to those who are pure of heart and a re only motivated by a sincere desire to understand and to learn. That is why, in a very subtle way, your sincerity and purity will be put to the test i n the coming months. If you prove yourself worthy of the Mysteries that are abo ut to be revealed to you, the Masters who watch over our Tradition will grant you the honor and privilege of continuing on the path that you are setting out upo n for the first time today. If the opposite should be the case, you will be exclud ed, perhaps forever, without even realizing it. Thus, the future of your affilia tion with AMORC depends upon you and you alone. The word Mandamus , which appears on the cover and at the top of each page of this monograph, designates the special mand ate that your Class Master has received for instructing you as a Postulant of our Order. This mandate was granted to you because you promised upon your honor to keep AMORC’s traditional teachings confidential. This means that they are placed at your disposal as a privilege of your affiliation, and th ey may be withdrawn if you are neglectful in your duty. My hope therefore is t hat you respect the commit- ment you made when facing your conscience and that you give proof of your worthiness and loyalty. After having studied this first Mandamus, acquaint yourself with the accompanying booklets entitled Liber 777—The Celestial Sanctum and Liber 888—Council of Solace . I ask you to give special attention to these book lets because the mystical principles they contain are im portant to know and are an integral part of the Rosicrucian philosophy. Mor eover, please keep in mind that these booklets are not con fiden- tial. Unlike the monographs and all the other docum ents you will receive as part of your affiliation, you c an loan Liber 777 and Liber 888 to nonmembers so that they may"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 1 read them, provided that they are interested in mys ticism and spiritual matters. While reading these booklets, their desire to know more concerning Rosicru- cian esotericism may be aroused. Beginning with the next mailing, you will receive f our monographs per month. I advise you to study one monograph per week. Also, beginning right now, choose a day of the week for your Rosicrucian studies and, as much as possible, do not change it. Such a choice will allo w you to establish a regular rhythm in your Rosicrucian work, thus contributing to a better assimilation of what you will study. Similarly, most Rosicrucians h ave chosen Thursday— and more particularly Thursday evening—to read thei r monographs. Why Thursday? Simply because Rosicrucian Tradition reco rds that it was on a Thursday evening that the Order founded by Thutmose III—and to whom the Order owes its traditional origins—held its fir st meeting in the temple of Karnak, Egypt, during the reign of this pharaoh. By devoting this day to their Rosicrucian studies, Rosicrucians from all over the world commemorate this event that is of gr eat importance for our mystical Order. If you cannot make Thursday night y our period for study, choose another day. Likewise, if it is impossible f or you to study your mono- graphs in the evening, do so in the morning, in the afternoon, or at any other time when you have the required tranquility. What m atters most of all, I repeat, is creating within yourself the habit of studying o n a certain day of the week. Furthermore, whatever the day and time you choose, let your family and friends know that you will not be available during this period. If necessary, make it clear to them that this time is devoted to private studies. In this way, you will avoid any interruption in your Rosicrucian work. Do not let your monographs accumulate with the good intention of studying them later on and catching up. If this hap pens, you may hinder the initiatory process which provides meaning to Rosicr ucianism. Moreover, such a way of proceeding will gradually weaken the attra ction which impelled you to request affiliation with our Order. In fact, each week it will become more and more difficult for you to read and study t he Rosicrucian teachings. On the other hand, regular and conscientious study will lead you to increas- ingly greater understanding and knowledge—sources o f profound inner satisfaction. In this way, you will derive all the theoretical and practical advantages which Rosi crucian philosophy can give to those who show themselves wo rthy of it. Moreover, if you wish to review certain mono graphs,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 1 nothing prevents you from doing so at the time you find most suitable between your regular study periods. In fact, it is up to ea ch person to be as organized as possible to make these studies most effective. T he general rules just stated remain valid for everyone, as they have proven thei r value. Besides regularity in your work, I recommend that y ou have a notebook reserved for your Rosicrucian studies. Write in it the principles you want to commit deep in your memory, the comments your monog raphs inspire in you, the questions you ask yourself, and the answers you receive at a given moment in your advancement. The contents of this notebook are to remain confiden- tial, because it is the silent witness of a mystica l intimacy which you alone can understand and assume. By reviewing your notebo ok periodically, you will find with pleasure that your inner understanding of the great truths of existence will blossom as the months go by and you will measu re the extent to which your desire to study the teachings of our Order has been justified. If you give it the care and attention required, it will reflect yo ur Rosicrucian progress from this day forward until the day when your affiliatio n is completed. To conclude these few remarks with a comment on adm inistrative matters, I wish to assure you that your name and address are k ept absolutely confidential on our part. All information concerning you, and wh ich is necessary to us concerning your affiliation with AMORC, is kept in files to which only persons authorized by me have access. Indeed, the Grand Lod ge does everything so that your trust in us is truly justified on all lev els. Again, let me express my pleasure in welcoming you as a member of our Order, and send you best wishes for Peace Profound. Sincerely and fraternally, Julie Scott Grand Master 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 1 Dear Fratres and Sorores, Convening a new class of Rosicrucian Postulants is a happy and important event in our Tradition, for it provides proof of th e desire and need for spirituality, which animates an ever-greater number of seekers. A s your Class Master, I welcome you in the name of the Imperator, all the G rand Masters, and all your fratres and sorores, and, on this memorable day, I convey to you their greetings. Before approaching the first principles of our teac hings, it will be useful for you to know certain facts that will allow you t o understand better what you have a right to expect from your affiliation. We believe tha t this will give you the feeling of real satisfaction regarding the deci sion you have made in seeking admittance within AMORC’s Portals. First of all, yo u must understand that what distinguishes Rosicrucians from other people i s the attraction they feel toward the mysteries of life. Their thirst for Know ledge incites them to explore the universe in which they live, because they are c onscious of the fact that they themselves are living reflections of it. They devote themselves, body and soul, to the study and application of our Order’s t eachings, because experience has, over time, shown them that Rosicrucian philoso phy makes it possible to understand better the meaning of life and, therefor e, to master it more fully. ROSICRUCIANISM: The purpose of our teachings is not to upset the s ocial and family environment in which we live, because su ch a negative perspective would be in total opposition with the law of evolut ion so dear to us. Although Rosicrucians, in the course of history, have contri buted to profound changes in society, they succeeded in laying the foundations f or such changes because they have understood, in light of what they had learned in the Order, that the world could only evolve positively by adapting themselves to the loftiest ideals. Therefore, the basic worth of Rosicrucianism reside s in the positive transformation that takes place in the innermost be ing of each member and which gradually makes him or her an enlightened being who is happy to be alive. In this sense, the objective of AMORC’s teachings is t o give us the intellectual and spiritual means to face the vicissitudes of our dai ly existence and to experience happiness, much like the joy we feel when in the pr esence of those who are dear to us. That is why the monogr aphs do not convey speculative teachings; they convey in stead a pragmatic knowledge based on a presentation of natu ral and cosmic laws at work in and around us."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 1 Many people have a poor understanding of what the w ord mysticism truly means. This word is too often associated with strange, unusual, and even disturbing behavior, whether it is used to def ine the state of mind or the mentality of someone who has no concept of the mate rial values of existence. For some, it is even synonymous with “magic.” Howev er, as we will show you in our teachings, Rosicrucian mysticism has not hing to do with magical practices, whatever their purpose and nature may be . For centuries, mysticism has dealt with the spiritual dimension of humans. T o be more precise, it is concerned with the study of natural and universal c onnections uniting each living being to the First Cause of all things—which we may cal l God , Divine Intelligence , Cosmic Consciousness , Universal Wisdom , or whatever we wish. From this point of view, any system whose goal is t o give humanity a better understanding of the place we occupy in the univers e, is mystical. AMORC, as a traditional, philosophical, and initiat ic Order, is interested in eternal values and strives to guide its members tow ard an approach of Absolute Truth. This being the case, we must emphasize that it does not in any way constitute a religious movement. By making this dec laration we do not wish to say that Rosicrucian teachings oppose any of the many existing religions; rather, the goals it pursues are completely differe nt. Generally speaking, a religion does not devote itse lf to the study of life. Rather, it is intent upon perpetuating dogmas that were established originally by one or more individuals. When these dogmas truly reflect the Universal Good, the behaviors dictated by the religion in que stion are valuable. When the contrary is true, they may oppose a person’s ph ysical and spiritual integrity. Moreover, any religious code bears the imprint of t he era in which it was defined. Therefore, a religion cannot be eternally valuable if its teachings are not regularly readapted to the evolution operating both within ourselves and within our environment. That explains why certain r eligious movements are currently experiencing profound reassessments. We cannot deny that religions, on the whole, have t heir origin in the revelations received by an individual through harmo nizing with Divine Wisdom. However, they do not teach the method to fo llow so that their students may achieve this harmonizati on on their own. In other words, the mystical course whic h the Messiah or the Prophet of a religion followed to re ach such"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 1 Illumination is not explained to the faithful. Rath er, they are expected to believe what they are told about the life of this Messiah o r Prophet. Mysticism, on the other hand, seeks to promote the inner awakening of each individual and to provide the spiritual means of harmonizing directly with Cosmic Consciousness. In other words, its purp ose is to allow men and women to have a personal experience of the Divine w ithout having recourse to a particular creed and without using any priesthood as an intermediary. That is why we feel that religions have an obvious usefulne ss, and yet they essentially constitute ways of belief, whereas a traditional Or der such as AMORC is a Path to Knowledge. As an introduction to the teachings that will be re vealed to you progressively, we propose that you consider certain phenomena whic h may have already attracted your attention or have given rise to refl ections on your part. All of these phenomena relate to laws and natural principl es that will be the subject of complete explanations in the monographs you will receive. Many people, due to their ignorance, classify them in the realm of superstition or associate them with supernatural events. Yet people have at their dis posal every faculty required for mastering them and making them useful in everyday life. It is true, as the ancient saying goes, that “it is from ignora nce and from ignorance alone that humanity must be freed.” THE HUMAN AURA: You may have noticed an illuminated streetlight on a foggy night. Apart from the light itself, you may have perceived a sort of radiance around it. We call this radiance an aura . All living creatures have an aura; however, unlike the one that may be seen arou nd a streetlight, the aura issuing from plants, animals, and human beings is i nvisible to the naked eye, at least under normal circumstances. Yet, the fact that it cannot be readily seen does not mean that it does not exist. To use an analogy, it is impossible to perceive the magnetism emanating from a magnet. Yet such magnetism does exist and it cannot be denied that it produces tangible effects on certain substances. Wi thout dwelling on the nature of the human aura—a study that we will save for fut ure monographs—we can say that the human aura is an electromagnetic f ield resulting from a combination of three major energie s—the first being associated with our physical body, the second with our vitality, and the third with our soul."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 1 Just as the existence of magnetism can be proved by observing its effects, it is likewise possible to test the influence that the aura exerts on its surroundings. In this regard, you must not think that the only wa y of proving whether the aura exists involves perceiving the color of its ra diance, although that would be naturally the most conclusive in this matter. Fo r example, you may have encountered a person for whom you immediately felt either an attraction or an aversion, even though this person said or did no thing whatsoever that could explain such an impression. Even if you were not objectively aware of it, this kind of impression often has its origin in the psyc hic influence that the aura of others can have upon us. Exercise: In connection with the aura, we suggest that you c arry out the following exercise. The next time you use public tr ansportation or when you find yourself in a crowd, analyze the impressio ns you experience when in contact with people. Do not study their faces or their demeanor, because that might cause suggestions to intervene that have nothing to do with the perception of the aura. Instead, note how your own thoughts, emotions, and feelings can change in regards to individuals with whom you are in contact. Since certain people react more to the vibrations o f the aura than others do, it will be interesting for you to realize the degree o f your own psychic sensitivity. TELEPATHY: As a form of mystical practice, telepathy dates ba ck to earliest antiquity. It was used by the Initiates, and, in ge neral, by all members of the Mystery Schools. Not so long ago, such a practice w as condemned by certain religious dogmas, and many superstitious people ass ociated this phenomenon with malevolent powers. Science also took a long ti me to recognize the authenticity of telepathy, because this phenomenon was beyond the scope of their researches and confronted them with still unk nown principles. For Rosicrucians, thought transmission is a practic e whose existence and effectiveness cannot be doubted. When following a w ell-defined method, it is possible to establish mental contact with other peo ple. As is the case with most faculties that are said to be “extraordinary”—using the true meaning of this word—telepathy is based on the use of the unlimited powers of the human consciousness. In the Rosicrucian teachings, we sha ll reveal the technique that you should follow when me ntally communicating with other persons so that you can se nd them brief and urgent messages. As part of this int roductory"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 1 monograph, we propose that you conduct the followin g exercise, which illustrates the soundness of this mental technique we may use to communicate with others. Exercise: When you find yourself in the company of about a d ozen people, whether at a meeting, a family gathering, or an eve ning among friends, choose one of them and, for a few moments, think intensely about that person without looking directly at him or her. When doing this, it is best to direct your gaze in another direction while visualizing the individual’ s face. After concentrating for fifteen to thirty seconds, stop your visualizat ion, and discreetly observe the person in question. You will find that right after completi ng your experiment, the individual will look your way as if, unconsciou sly, he or she had been feeling that you were thinking of him or her. VIBROTURGY: Rosicrucians have taught for centuries that all obj ects become impregnated with vibrations emanating from p ersons who come in contact with them. Although science still denies th is principle, we know that matter preserves the memory of these vibrations. We can even go further by stating that our thoughts affect the vibratory natu re of objects around us, while the vibrations retained by material substances, in turn, affect us. For instance, have you ever entered a house for the first time and found that though its appearance was attractive, you neverthel ess felt ill at ease? Or have you ever felt a pleasant sensation as you entered a room that was nevertheless untidy and not at all beautiful? Human beings affec t the places in which they live. Conversely, places exert a certain influence on sufficiently sensitive persons, bringing about specific reactions within t hem. It is important to remember that vibroturgy has not hing to do with magical or supernatural practices. As we just said, it is b ased on certain laws inherent to matter and consciousness. From a Rosicrucian point of view, it results from the fact that everything in you and around you is vibra tory. In this sense, vibroturgic perception is an ability that consists of inwardly harmonizing ourselves with the vibratory nature of objects, which act as intermediaries so that we receive impressions concerning people who have been in contact with them for a sufficient length of time. Thus, it is necessary that one have a sufficiently developed psychic sensitivity. In due time we will provide you with e xercises to perform so that you will acquire this developmen t. To"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 1 this end, we propose that you perform the following exercise as soon as you have the opportunity. Exercise: As soon as you can, go to a public library and take a magazine or a book that has obviously been looked through by ma ny persons. If possible, close your eyes and hold this magazine or book for a few minutes while remaining in a state of total receptivity. In other words, while in contact with it, be open to receiving impressions emanating from people who have held it. If your psychic sensitivity is sufficient, you will ex perience certain sensations that, depending on the situation, can be expressed by the perception of a face, voice, odor, scene, etc. Such reactions will not be due to your imagination; they are due instead to the effects of vibroturgy. It is possibl e that you will not receive any impression; rather, you will have either a feeling of well-b eing or discomfort. We will explain why in future monographs. If it is impossible for you to go to a library, you may perform this experiment at home us ing objects once in contact with various people. A family gem is a good medium for vibroturgy. METAPHYSICAL HEALING: We sometimes become tired. When this happens, we feel ineffective and sometimes we even become irritable. In such a situation, many people resort to some artificial means for recovering vitality. This may involve medication, a cup of coffee, or so me other stimulant to the nerves. Such a way of behaving is not effective, be cause it only gives the illusion of no longer being weary. Moreover, such s timulants often produce side effects that, without our being aware of it, d isturb our physical and psychic equilibrium. Rosicrucians know of a natural method for neutraliz ing the underlying cause of fatigue, rather than just its effect. This method is part of the numerous practices AMORC teaches its members so that they ca n treat many disorders afflicting humans. In fact, a whole degree of study is devoted to Rosicrucian therapy. Such therapy is based on a way of using th e autonomic nervous system—particularly its sympathetic division—to pro duce a stimulation of deficient or diseased organs, this stimulation being eithe r positive or negative according to the disorder involved. As you will lea rn, this method of healing is composed of placing one’s fingers on specific parts of the body and carrying out a certain type of breathing. Exercise: As a practical application of the previous statements, we suggest that the next time you feel tired,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 1 whether following strenuous physical or mental work , you proceed as follows: Sit comfortably, with your back as straight as poss ible and your feet placed flat on the ground and slightly apart from each oth er. While in this position, place the tips of the thumb and first two fingers o f your right hand to the back of the neck, to the left of the spinal column. Afte r placing your fingers thus, inhale deeply through your nose, hold your breath f or a few moments, and then exhale deeply through your nose. Without removing y our fingers, breathe three or four more times in this way. Then resume your no rmal rate of breathing. After a few minutes, you will feel much better. MYSTICAL SOUNDS: The sacred texts of most religions refer to a Divi ne Word that, at the beginning of time, spread througho ut the universe and eventually gave rise to all Creation, visible and i nvisible. This Word, according to many religions, was the Word that God uttered wh en the Divine wished to create the world. Apart from what religious dogm as teach on this subject, Rosicrucians have known for centuries that certain sounds uttered by humans produce vibrations that affect the persons intoning them and those who hear them. That is why such sounds are used for specific purposes, notably in mental alchemy, mystical healing, and the developme nt of psychic centers, called chakras in Eastern traditions. AMORC, as a traditional and initiatory Order, posse sses a store of knowledge on the origin, nature, and power of these mystical sounds, which we call vowel sounds, and that can also be given the name of mantras . In later degrees, we will explain in detail how to intone them so as to benefit from the positive influence they exercise on the physica l body and on the human psychic centers, which are twelve in number. In thi s first Mandamus, we cannot provide you with a detailed description of a ll the vowel sounds you will study, any more than we can study all the different psychic centers of the body one by one. However, we suggest that you carry out the following experiment over the next few days. Exercise: Sit down in a place where you can have perfect pea ce and quiet, whether at home or outdoors. Hold your back as stra ight as possible and place the palms of your hands on your knees. Once in this posi- tion, close your eyes, inhale deeply through your n ose. Then exhale slowly while intoning aloud the vowel s ound OM. Do it on the note of your choice, and be sure t hat you"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 1 extend its intonation as long as possible, in this way: OOOOMMMMmmmm . Intone this sound several times and note the impres sions it produces in you. You may note a feeling of well-being and, in some cases , an agreeable sensation in the center of your head. The intonation of the v owel sound OM especially affects the physiological and psychic activity of t he pineal gland that is located in the precise center of the head, at the level of the forehead. We hope that the few exercises we have presented wi ll have stimulated your interest in the studies you are about to under take as part of your affiliation with AMORC. The monographs that you will receive in the coming months will provide you with detailed explanations on myst ical principles relating to these exercises, which, we repeat, constitute an ap proach that is both specific and general regarding subjects covered in the Rosic rucian teachings. You will gradually familiarize yourself with the laws g overning the physical and metaphysical aspects of existence. In closing, it is a new world that will be opened to you, a world whose beauty, grandeur, and nobility may exceed anything you have conceived of as existing on the human plane until now. With best wishes for Peace Profound, Sincerely and fraternally, YOUR CLASS MASTER NOTE: The symbol which appears in the lower corner of ea ch page of this monograph is a very old Rosicrucian symbol. We find it in documents of our Order, some of which are several centuries old and, in many cases, were written by hand and in various languages. This symb ol traditionally designates the section in which you find yourself as a Postula nt of AMORC. Whenever you progress to another section and degree, another sym bol will be revealed to you. The dove, as represented in this symbol, has no rel igious connotation. It represents the inner consciousness of the person wh o constantly seeks to rise to a better comprehension of the Divine. It also sy mbolizes the purity of one’s intent.
