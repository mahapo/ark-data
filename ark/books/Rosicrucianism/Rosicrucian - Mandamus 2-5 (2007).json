As the history of Rosicrucianism fits into that of Western esotericism, it is important to emphasize what underlies this concept. The adjective “esoteric” comes from the Greek word esoterikos , which is derived from eso “within” and eis “into.” The word literally means “toward the inter ior” and describes that which is not directly accessible. It evokes the con cept of moving toward the center, the interior. Thus, esotericism is the know ledge of that which relates to internal things, of which the intellect can touch u pon only to a certain extent. In short, it involves a gnosis, a knowledge that le ads to a transformation, a regeneration of the soul. Furthermore, as shown by Antoine Faivre, esotericis m constitutes more a way of approaching matters rather than a body of defined doctrines. Its fundamental elements, such as alchemy, magic, a strology, Kabbalah, magnetism, and various spiritual techniques with wh ich it is associated, are not readily apparent. It has been pieced together s lowly, has penetrated the West gradually, and has been subjected to various i nfluences. Our study will thus lead us to places of its birth—mythical and re al—and to those countries and times through which it has traveled. Therefore, we will visit Egypt; Greece; the Arab lands; Europe during the Middle Ages, Rena issance, and Age of Enlightenment; France of the Belle Époque; and the New World. While on our journey, we will meet such extraordinary individual s as Hermes Trismegistus, Marsilio Ficino, Giordano Bruno, John Dee, Theophra stus Paracelsus, Franz Anton Mesmer, Joséphin Peladan, Harvey Spencer Lewi s—not to mention someone as unexpected as Erik Satie. We will also c ome across numerous initiatory organizations that have played a more or less important role in Western esotericism or in the Rosicrucian movement. —CHRISTIAN REBISSE Rosicrucian History and Mysteries"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"3 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 2 Dear Fratres and Sorores, Before beginning the systematic study of the Rosicr ucian teachings we feel it would be useful to give you a general notion of the traditional and historical dimension of the Order you have just joined. Such a glimpse will enable you to have a better grasp of AMORC’s place in the world o f esotericism. First of all, you should know that the initials A.M.O.R.C. are an abbreviation of the full, current title of the Rosicrucian Order , whose name, in English, is the Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis . In certain texts and documents in our archives it is designated by letters that ar e an abbreviation of the Latin name that the Order had in the past—namely, Antiquus Arcanus Ordo Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis , which literally means “Ancient, Arcane Order of t he Red Rose and of the Golden Cross.” As for the traditional symbol of AMORC, it consists of a golden cross with a single red rose in the center. As far as one may go back in time, this symbol has been the same and will remain so forever. The golden cross represents the human physical body, and the red rose represents the soul on the path of evolution. It is not religious in character . There exist a certain number of variations of the symbol of our Order. AMORC’S HISTORY: AMORC is not a philosophical movement of recent creation. Rather, its Tradition has its origins in the Mystery Schools of ancient Egypt. As its name implies, these ancient schools brought together enlightened mystic s who met regularly to study the mysteries of life. Eager for knowledge an d wisdom, these mystics aspired to a greater understanding of natural, univ ersal, and spiritual laws. In ancient times—in the time of the ancient Egyptia n, Greek, and Roman civilizations—the word mystery did not have the meaning it has today. In other words, it was not synonymous with “weird” or “strange.” It referred instead to a gnosis, a secret wisdom, known only to the Initiates. In ancient Egypt, one of the first Mystery Schools was the Osirian School. Its teachings concerned the life, death, and resurr ection of the god Osiris. They were enacted as theatrical pro ductions, or, more accurately, as ritual dramas. Only those p ersons who had proved their sincere desire for knowledge could participate."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 2 Over the centuries the Mystery Schools added a grea ter initiatory dimension to the knowledge they transmitted. Their mystical l abors then assumed a more closed character and were held exclusively in templ es that had been built for that purpose. According to the Rosicrucian teaching s, the great pyramids of Gizeh were the most sacred in the eyes of the Initi ates. Thus, contrary to what most historians claim, these pyramids were not cons tructed to serve as tombs for the pharaohs. They were places of study and mys tical initiation. The initiations in the Egyptian Mysteries included a final phase in which the candidates experienced a symbolic death. Lying in a sarcophagus and maintained by mystical processes in an intermed iate state, they had the opportunity to experience a momentary separation betw een the body and soul. This separation was intended to show them that they were indeed dual beings. After experiencing this, the candidates could no lo nger doubt that humans possessed a spiritual nature and their destiny was to return to the Divine Kingdom. After having made the promise to never rev eal this initiation and after having committed themselves to follow the pat h of mysticism, they were gradually instructed in the most esoteric teachings that a mortal can receive. THE MYSTICAL PHARAOHS: Rosicrucian Tradition relates that Pharaoh Thutmose III (1504-1447 BCE), considered by histori ans to be one of the greatest rulers of the 18th Dynasty, was one of the Initiates who attended the Mystery Schools of Egypt. During this period, t he schools functioned in a completely independent way and had their own rule s. After having been designated by the Lector-priests to succeed his fat her on the throne, Thutmose III decided to bring all of these schools together into a single Order governed by one set of rules, so as to create a unique organ ization. Due to his intelligence and wisdom, he was chosen Grand Master and held thi s office until his death. It should also be noted that he was the first ruler to bear the title of Pharaoh , which is of great significance on the mystical leve l. About seventy years later, Pharaoh Amenhotep IV was born in the royal palace at Thebes. Admitted at an early age into the Order founded by Thutmose III, he became Grand Master and devoted himself to structuring the teachings and rituals. Meanwhile, he officially established m onotheism, in an era when polytheism had spread over the face of the Earth and he changed his name to Akhnaton, which me ans “Pious toward Aton.” Akhnaton encouraged a revoluti on in"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 2 the fields of art and culture. Profoundly humanisti c, he dedicated his whole life to fighting against the darkness of ignorance and to the promotion of the loftiest ideals. Shortly after his death, which occurred in 1350 BCE, the powerful clergy of Thebes reinstated the cult of Am on; however, Akhnaton’s work was already a permanent part of history. From Egypt, the Order spread to Greece, notably thr ough the intermediary of Pythagoras (572-492 BCE), then into ancient Rome , under the impulse of Plotinus (203-270 CE). It was during Charlemagne ’s time (742-814), and due to the work of the philosopher Arnaud, that the Order was introduced into France, and then into Germany, England, and th e Netherlands. During the following centuries, the Alchemists and Templars contributed to its spread, both in the West and the East. As fr eedom of conscience was often lacking, the Order concealed itself under various names and conducted its activities under the veil of secrecy. However, it remained extant, perpetuating its ideals and teachings, participatin g directly or indirectly in the advancement of the arts, sciences, and civiliza tion in general, and always extolling the equality of men and women and true co mmunity among humans. CYCLICAL RESURGENCE: In certain works discussing Rosicrucian history, reference is made to an individual by the name of “Christian Rosenkreuz” (1378-1484) as being the founder of the Rosicrucians. This is a mistake. In reality, the Order had already been i n existence for centuries; however, it functioned according to cycles of activ ity followed by periods of inactivity. As the time approached for the Order’s resurgence, arrangements were made for the announcement of the opening of a “tomb” in which the “body” of a “Grand Master C.R.C.” would be found, w ith rare jewels and manuscripts that empowered the discoverers to proce ed with the Order’s revival for a new cycle of activity. This announcem ent was allegorical and the initials C.R.C. did not designate a living individu al. It is in the light of these explanations that we need to consider the legendary “Christian Rosenkreuz” and his history. It was in the 17th century that the Order came out of its anonymity, following the publication of three Manifestos in Germany and in France. These were the Fama Fraternitatis (1614), the Confessio Fraternitatis (1615), and the Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreuz (1616). These three Manifestos, blending stories"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 2 both historical and allegorical, were written by a college of Rosicrucians, the Tübingen Circle, that included Johann Valentine Andreae (1586-1654). A few years later, in 1623, posters originating from the Principal College of the Rose-Cross were posted on the walls of Paris. This marked the beginning of a new cycle of the Order, which was then publicly kno wn as the “Order of the Rose Cross.” In 1693, under the leadership of Grand Master Johan nes Kelpius (1673- 1708), Rosicrucians from different European countri es sailed for the New World on board the Sarah Maria . Early in 1694 they reached Philadelphia and settled down. A few years later, some of them m oved farther west in Pennsylvania and founded a new colony. After establ ishing their own print shop, they issued a large number of masterpieces of exoteric literature and introduced the Rosicrucian teachings to America. It was also under the impulse of European Rosicrucians that many American institu tions were established, and unprecedented contributions were made to the wo rld of arts and sciences in the United States. Such eminent individuals as B enjamin Franklin (1706-1790) and Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826) were i n close contact with this Rosicrucian work. AMORC’S CURRENT CYCLE: In 1801 the Order became inactive in the United States. However, it remained very active in France, Germany, England, Switzerland, Spain, Russia, and the East. In 1909, Harvey Spencer Lewis (1883-1939), who had been a student of esotericism for many years and who was particularly interested in Rosicrucian philosop hy, traveled to France in order to meet officials of the Order. After submitt ing to numerous examinations and various trials, he was initiated in Toulouse an d officially charged with preparing for the reactivation of the Rosicrucian O rder in America, just as World War I was about to begin in Europe. When everything was ready for this reactivation, a Manifesto was issued in the United States, announcing a new cycle of activi ty for the Order, which was then given the name Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (A.M.O.R.C.). Duly appointed Imperator, H. Spencer Lewis develope d the activities of the Order in America and began to put the Rosicrucian t eachings in writing, drawing on the archives that had been e ntrusted to him by the Rosicrucians of France. After World War II, this method was extended to the entire world. Thus, AMOR C"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 2 became the guardian of the Rosicrucian Tradition in all countries where it can freely exercise its activities. In 1990, Christian Bernard, then AMORC Grand Master of France, was elected by the Supreme Council to the office of Imp erator, and to the present day he assumes responsibility for Rosicrucian activ ities in the world. He is assisted in this task by the Grand Masters of the v arious jurisdictions. If you would like more information concerning AMORC ’s present structure, we suggest that you obtain, if you have not done so already, the booklet “Mastery of Life.” A copy of this booklet c an be obtained by writing to the Grand Lodge.

Thus, the ultimate goal of initiatic development is to reach the Rose- Croix state. It is important to emphasize here that the words Rosicrucian and Rose-Croix do not have the same meaning in AMORC. The first designates an indi vidual who studies the Order’s teachings and philosophy, whereas the secon d indicates an individual who, at the end of this study, has attained perfect ion, in the sense of being wise in his or her judgments and behavior.

You will thus be able to measure the e xpanse of knowledge to be transmitted to you within the four sections of our teachings. THE POSTULANT SECTION: At present you are in the Postulant Section. This section, which includes only eight monographs, consists of a general presentation of our Tradition, and of the history a nd teachings of our Order. The goal of this presentation is to familiarize you with Rosicrucianism. It also includes the study of the very first subjects that shall be brought to your attention—notably time, space, and consciousness. M oreover, you will learn the technique of meditation as practiced by Rosicru cians. THE NEOPHYTE SECTION: We then come to the Neophyte Section, which represents the symbolic antechamber of the Ro sicrucian Temple. Indeed, this section constitutes an introduction to the subjects presented in the following sections. Also called the Atrium , it consists of three degrees, each of which is preceded by an initiation that you may perform in your home. This initiation does not assume religious or magica l characteristics. Here is a summary of the subjects that you will study in each of these three Atriums: The First Atrium involves a general study of matter , which is the manifestation of an energy given the name of Spirit in the teachings of our Order. It also includes a series of monographs deal ing with thought and certain mental faculties, such as concentration and visuali zation, to mention only the most important. The Second Atrium consists of an introduction to se lf-healing. In this Atrium we explain the origin and nature of most dis eases afflicting humanity. Moreover, the method by which we apply Rosicrucian treatments is presented, this method being founded on a positive or negative stimulation of certain sympathetic ganglia of the autonomic nervous system . The Third Atrium is devoted to a general examinatio n of doctrines concerning the concept of God, early religions, the origin and nature of the human soul. In this Atrium are also p resented the great laws governing our spiritual evolution—no tably free"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 3 will, karma, and reincarnation. The study of this d egree ends with explanations concerning the way in which Rosicrucians conceive C osmic Masters and the place they occupy in Creation. THE INITIATE SECTION: As indicated by its name, the Initiate Section marks an important stage, because it permits access to the inner circle of our Order. It includes nine degrees, called Temple Degrees , each of which is dedicated to a major theme of Rosicrucian Ontology. Moreover, beginning with this section a Rosicrucian may go to a Lodge a nd be truly initiated into our Tradition. It takes sixteen months to reach the first of these degrees. The First Temple Degree reveals the fundamental law s governing the macrocosm and the microcosm. It constitutes a synth esis of what the mystics of the past, particularly the philosophers of ancie nt Greece, taught on the subjects of the origins of the universe, the vibrat ions of the Ether, and the atomic structure of matter. This synthesis includes the most recent scientific data available in this field. The Second Temple Degree deals with human conscious ness. Its objective, subjective, and subconscious phases are the object of an in-depth study allowing a clear understanding of what psychologist s teach on the subject of mental faculties. Nevertheless, it should be not ed that the concepts are approached within the context of Rosicrucian philos ophy and consequently provide explanations transcending those offered by the field of psychology. The Third Temple Degree is dedicated to the laws of life. It is shown that these laws, as manifested on the earthly plane, ori ginate in a single cosmic energy: Vital Life Force. We also explain that the mineral, plant, animal, and human kingdoms form a natural chain which supports the evolution of the Universal Soul. After defining criteria common to a ll living creatures, we then go on to study human life. The Fourth Temple Degree is based entirely upon an ancient Rosicrucian manuscript. While constantly referring to precepts expressed in this manuscript, this degree constitutes a synthesis of the three pr evious degrees and deals with inspiring philosophical subjects. Generally speakin g, this degree makes it possible to understand how matter, consciousness, and life form a coherent whole and j ointly contribute to Cosmic Evolution."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 3 The Fifth Temple Degree is an account of the life a nd work of the greatest philosophers of ancient Greece. Its goal is to fami liarize Rosicrucian students with the teachings of the scholars of Greek antiqui ty, and with the legacy of philosophical and scientific precepts which have al ways fascinated humanity. All of the monographs of this degree are taken from the archives of our Order and refer to little-known historical facts. The Sixth Temple Degree is dedicated to Rosicrucian therapy and provides rules to be followed so as to maintain good health. However, the great distinction of this degree is the study of mystical principles that have been used by Rosicrucians for centuries to treat those diseas es from which we suffer. These principles, which in no way represent a subst itute for official medicine, are part of the heritage provided by the ancient Es senes. They are based on magnetism and the method of working upon the autono mic nervous system of humans, which directs and controls the activity of all the organs of the body. The Seventh Temple Degree deals with the psychic bo dy of humans and with the functions characterizing it, among whi ch are included psychic projection (also called “astral travel”). This degr ee also includes a thorough study of the human aura and of the psychic centers, many of which correspond to what are called chakras in Eastern traditions. There follows a detailed examination of the traditional vowel sounds ( mantras ) and the physical, psychic, and spiritual influence they exert over hu man beings. The Eighth Temple Degree concerns the origin and de stiny of humans. The subjects that are studied directly concern our spiritual evolution. Included among these subjects are: the concept of God; the U niversal Soul; the human soul and its attributes; the before-life; the myste ry of birth; the application of free will; karma and the method of mastering it; the mystery of death; the afterlife; reincarnation; assisting the dying; and the power of prayer. The Ninth Temple Degree completes the Initiate Sect ion. The first half is devoted to the study of traditional symbolism an d the mystical principles relating to it. The second half discusses practices that have always attracted the adepts of mysticism: radiesthesia, telekinesis, vibroturgy, telepathy, materialization, invisibility, cosmic harmonization , etc. It is in this degree that Rosicrucians are initiated into th ose faculties which appeal to the soul itself and which allow us to benefit from our divine nature."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 3 THE ILLUMINATI SECTION: We cannot reveal anything regarding the contents of the Illuminati Section within the scope of this monograph, as it would be premature and contrary to the initiatic ch aracter of our Order. You only need to know that it is composed of three degr ees, each of them being dedicated to the study of profoundly esoteric subje cts. Moreover, this section contains mystical experiments that are of the highe st importance on both the psychic and spiritual planes. If you persevere on the Rosicrucian Path, the day will come when you will gain access to the teachings of these three higher degrees. You have probably wondered about the origins of the Rosicrucian teachings. As we explained in the last monograph, they have th eir source in the Mystery Schools of ancient Egypt. To the wisdom perpetuated by the sages of that land were added the concepts transmitted by the gre at philosophers of ancient Greece, especially the Neo-Platonists. Then the sec ret gnosis was enriched by the alchemists of the Middle Ages and the thinkers of the Renaissance, such as Nicholas Flamel, Cornelius Agrippa, Paracelsus, Pico della Mirandola, Leonardo da Vinci, and John Dee. In the 17th centur y eminent Rosicrucians defined and developed certain aspects of this ancie nt heritage. Included among them were Francis Bacon, Michael Maier, Robert Flud d, Elias Ashmole, and Comenius. Other important individuals were members of the Order or were in contact with it. These include Jacob Boehme, Ren é Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, Isaac Newton, Wilhelm Leibniz, Benjamin Fr anklin, the Comte de Saint-Germain, Cagliostro, Louis-Claude de Saint-Ma rtin, Michael Faraday, Papus, Claude Debussy, Erik Satie, and Edith Piaf. Since 1909, the beginning of AMORC’s present cycle, other Rosicrucians specializing in various fields of knowledge have al so contributed to these teachings. Among them, we naturally find those who have acted or are now acting in an official capacity in the Order, an d we also have members who, as physicists, chemists, biologists, psycholog ists, physicians, artists, or philosophers, work constantly for the cultural enri chment of Rosicrucian knowledge. We say “cultural,” because the spiritual and initiatic dimension of the Rosicrucian Tradition is what it always has bee n and what it shall remain forever."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 3 In the next lesson we will begin our study of the f irst subject presented in this section—namely, time.

The Postulant Section consists of a general presen tation of the Tradition, history, and teachings of our Order. It also includ es the first subjects of the Rosicrucian teachings.

Furthermore, this section contai ns mystical experiments of considerable importance on both the psychic and spiritual planes. The Rosicrucian teachings have their source in the sacred legacy that the Order received from the ancient Mystery Schools. Ov er the centuries, many philosophers, mystics, and scholars have enric hed this legacy with their own contributions."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20 Mandamus No. 4 CONCURRENCE In concurrence with this monograph, we offer you a quotation of Sir Francis Bacon. In the following lines, he explains his conception of Knowledge and the use that mystics should make of it. At this stage in your Rosicrucian studies, we suggest that you meditate on their prof ound meaning. The greatest error of all is mistaking the ultimate end of knowledge; for some covet knowledge out of a natural curiosity and inquisitive temper; some to entertain the mind with variety and delight ; some for ornament and reputation; some for victory and contention; many f or lucre and a livelihood; and few for employing the Divine gift of reason to the use and benefit of humanity. Thus some appear to seek in knowledge a c ouch for a searching spirit; others, a walk for a wandering mind; others , a tower of state; others, a fort or commanding ground; and others, a shop for p rofit or sale, instead of a storehouse for the glory of the Creator and the end owment of human life. Yet that which must dignify and exalt knowledge is the more intimate and strict conjunction of contemplation and action; a conjunct ion like that of Saturn, the planet of rest and contemplation; and Jupiter, the planet of civil society and action. And yet here, by use and action, we do not mean the applying of knowledge for lucre, for that diverts the advanceme nt of knowledge, as the golden ball thrown before Atalanta, which, while sh e stoops to take up, the race is hindered. —FRANCIS BACON (1561–1626)"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 4 Dear Fratres and Sorores, From a philosophical point of view, there exist two methods for approaching the study of divine laws. The first consists of ima gining what the Supreme Cause of the universe may be and, using this idea a s a basis, studying the way in which it is expressed on the terrestrial plane. The second involves examining ourselves, and using that examination as a starting point, in generalizing about the universal laws and principles which govern both our body and soul. As you will note when studying the monographs, Rosi crucian philosophy is a synthesis of these two methods, because it ass ociates the study of humans with that of the Divine. Sometimes Rosicrucian phil osophy shows how to apply a particular cosmic law to our life, while at other times it makes evident the cosmic counterpart of a principle that governs our being. This process is truly a mystical application of a great Hermetic la w: “As below, so above; as above, so below.” Moreover, such a way of looking a t human existence takes human duality into account. In the Postulant Section we will provide you with a general notion of what can be said concerning consciousness as it manifest s in humans. In doing so, we will consider two concepts which mystics and phi losophers contemplate, namely, “time” and “space.” Scientists have likewis e interested themselves in the study of these two concepts; however, their approach is generally too materialistic. They tend to regard time and space a s material realities which humans can master only by having recourse to techno logy. Such a point of view is inaccurate, because it does not take into a ccount the unlimited powers of human consciousness. As we will show you in the course of our teachings, it is within the innermost part of ourselves that t he means of transcending physical limits imposed upon us by the spatial-temp oral dimension of our existence are found. If humans spend so much energy in attempting to con quer time and space it is because our way of conceiving those two princ iples is erroneous. To a large extent, it is because we are unaware that our potential intelligence could be put to more useful ends for our own benefit and for the benefit of all humanity. Accordingly, we will demon strate to you that these two concepts are, above all, prod ucts of the objective consciousness of human beings, and th at they"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 4 in no way constitute the material obstacles to whic h many of us believe we are enslaved. We do not wish to imply that we must behave as if t hese two principles exerted no influence on our lives. What we want you to understand is that it is possible to transcend these conditions and to fr ee yourself from numerous material constraints which exist only by virtue of the importance we grant them. If we succeed in this, you will have at your disposal a solid philosophical base that will give your life a direction more in k eeping with what it could be. Let us now examine in greater detail those poorly u nderstood concepts of time and space. TIME: We have noted that, since the dawn of civilization, human beings have always tried to understand what time is. According to anthropologists, the first point of reference used for that purpose was the al ternation of day and night. Early humans began by associating the passing of ho urs with such natural manifestations as light and darkness. This first ap proach to time was positive, for it enabled humans to understand that a phenomen on was involved which continued with regularity and against which we are powerless. Moreover, it caused to be born in human consciousness a primitiv e idea of chronology—in other words, the concept of the succession of hours and events. No one can say at what point human beings grasped t he meaning that is now given to the words yesterday , today , and tomorrow; however, when we gained access to these three major dimensions of ti me, our conscious life was radically transformed, because life was now divided into the past, present, and future. According an ever greater importance to the division of time, human beings created various precise instruments for meas uring time so as to have at their disposal a frame of reference enabling them t o plan their daily activities more efficiently. Time became a basic element of ou r existence, to the same degree as the food we need to survive. When we observe the hectic pace of modern living, w e have to admit that the race against time which humans have undertaken for centuries has not ceased to accelerate. Such a state of affairs is un fortunate, for it is proof of our inability to master a principle which should serve us rather than enslave us. If all human beings were to give t o this principle the proper place it deserves, we would un derstand"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 4 that as long as we adapt ourselves to the material idea we have formed of time, we will stray from the natural laws which must guid e our existence. Why? Because time is not a material condition; it is a p roduct of human consciousness. Therefore, it is impossible to master time except b y calling upon our highest psychic and spiritual faculties. Experience proves that human beings constantly seek to conquer time by mundane, and limited, means . By proceeding in this way, we do nothing more than reinforce the power of our illusions. We have just stated that time is not a material con dition; it is a product of human consciousness. Such a remark deserves fuller explanation, because it poses in itself the philosophical problem associate d with this subject. Let us then use a few examples to illustrate this point. When we must do something that is unappealing to us , we have the impression that the hours do not move rapidly. We s ay that “time passes slowly.” On the other hand, when we are engaged in some activity we find exciting, we “do not feel the passage of time” and regret that we have to call a halt to what we are doing. Yet, in both cases, th e hours are always of the same mathematical duration. In other words, each ho ur will always equal sixty minutes. This is proof that it is our consciousness that gives a relative value to time. Thus, when we are bored or unmotivated, our i nner state is such that we feel that we are slaves to the passing hours. When our emotional and mental activity is concentrated on a subject that interest s us, we lose all notion of duration and feel freed from the grasp of time. The arbitrary nature of time is even more obvious w hen we sleep, because we no longer have any point of reference for measur ing it. This explains why, after having slept all night, we may have the feeli ng of having slumbered only a few hours. Likewise, many persons, having co me out of a deep coma which lasted several months, have had the impressio n that their state of unconsciousness lasted only a few days. Thus, a per iod of time, depending on whether it is lived in a state of wakefulness, duri ng sleep, or in a deep coma, is not interpreted in the same way by our consciousnes s. This phenomenon is even more striking when we dream . In this situation you are quite aware that we can experience events i n our dreams that would correspond to several hours or ev en several days on the material plane. Yet, it has bee n proven"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 4 scientifically that our dream periods do not exceed one or two minutes. This example also demonstrates that the notion of time i s arbitrary as it does not always correspond to the usual meaning we assign to it. It follows, therefore, that time, as we usually con ceive it, is a state of objective consciousness. From the moment we transcend this st ate and pass the limits of conscious objectivity, we lose all notion of dur ation. That is what happens when we sleep or when, for any other reason, we are no longer conscious of the earthly plane. In this sense, deep meditatio n can also make us lose all notion of time. This is explained by the fact that our mental activity is situated on the subconscious level, which, by definition, is part of the unconscious. In future degrees we will show you how to rise volunta rily to that level and thus experience the non-temporal. Such an experience wil l prove to you that human beings can momentarily transcend the limits of time and have access to both the past and future of human history. On the cosmic plane everything occurs simultaneously and constitutes an eternal present. It is important to understand at this point that we ascribe such a material value to time because we are in the habit of associ ating it with the rhythm that we give to our conscious life—that is, to acti vities which occupy our state of wakefulness and which, to a certain extent , constitute the apparent movement of our existence. From that point of view, it has become a point of reference which allows us to measure arbitrarily the periods when we are conscious of ourselves and our surroundings. Bu t beyond that point is a world just as real, a world which has its source in Cosmic Eternity and that each of us possesses within our innermost self. Our mission is to explore this world, because within it resides the basis of our e xistence and the key to the mysteries we seek to understand. In the next monograph we will continue our study by analyzing in more detail the concept of space, because this concept i s directly connected with the concept of time. Meanwhile, we advise you to re ad several more times the explanations given today and to record your com ments in your study notebook.

Defer not till the evening what the morning may accomplish. —Unto Thee I Grant 26 The major faculty enabling us to be conscious of the passing of time is none other than memory. Thanks to this faculty, it is possible for us to retrace our past life. We might think that the closer an event is to the present, the more easily it returns to memory. Current experience proves that this is not so, because the recall of memories is linked to the interest we took in events relating to them. That is why we may recall facts dating back to our earliest childhood and yet be unable to recall some recent event. From a philosophical point of view, this shows that what is important for our consciousness is not the passage of time, but the experiences that made it possible for us to know and remember. During the coming days, we propose that you verify for yourself the cogency of these remarks by trying to trace the course of your own life and by noting the significant events you remember. You will certainly note that many memories concern the earliest years of your existence and that you will recall them with as much precision and clarity as though they had only occurred a few days ago.

In concur rence with this monograph, which deals with space as well as time, we propose that you meditate on what Swedenborg wrote on this subject in his work entitl ed Arcana Coelestia . As you will note, his viewpoint is in accord with the Rosicrucian conception of the duality of space-time—namely, that it involves a concept specific to our earthly existence and to our objective perception o f the material environment. There are two things which while humans live in the world appear to be essential, because they are proper to nature, namel y, space and time. Hence to live in space and time is to live in the world o r in nature. Yet in the other life these two things are of no consequence. In the worl d of spirits indeed they do appear to be of some consequence, for the reason th at spirits fresh from the body still retain the idea of natural things; yet i t is not long before they perceive that there is no space and time there, only state; and that in the other life states correspond to spaces and times in nature; to spaces states as to Being (esse), and to times states as to Coming forth (existere). From this any one can see what kind of an idea we may have while in the world or in nature, respecting the things of the other life and many arcana of fai th; namely, that we are not willing to believe them until we apprehend them by means of the things in the world, nay, by sensuous things; for we must suppose that if we were to put off the idea of space and time, and still more space an d time themselves, we would become absolutely nothing; and thus we would have n othing left from which we could feel and think, except something confused and incomprehensible; when yet the case is exactly the reverse.

We will retur n to these two subjects in future degrees; however, it is necessary for us to bring out their basic principles in this Postulant Section. SPACE: Space, as defined in most dictionaries, is the rel atively limited expanse separating and surrounding objects. This ex panse, according to current definitions, is the source of the three dimensions which humans can perceive and which, as you know, are length, width, and heig ht—the latter sometimes being likened to thickness. Such a definition is in complete on the mystical level, because it takes into account only visible s pace. Yet there exist invisible planes which, for certain faculties of our consciou sness, are as perceptible and real as our physical universe. Moreover, even on th e scientific level, such a manner of defining space does not correspond to an accurate description of the material world and of everything constituting it. It is easy to show that knowing only the length, wi dth, and height of an object does not allow us to know its composition. F or example, if we ask you to imagine a ruler approximately 20 cm (8 inches) l ong, 3 cm (1-3/8 inches) wide, and 2 mm (1/16 inch) thick, you will have a c lear mental image of it. However, these specifications will not allow you to know whether the ruler is made of wood, plastic, or steel. That is why Ros icrucians have asserted for centuries that the different forms of matter being integrated in space occupy not three but four dimensions—the fourth being defi ned by their vibratory frequency. This point will be discussed in detail i n the next section. In connection with the preceding remarks, we will n ow emphasize a principle to which we have not given enough attenti on, which is that our sense of sight plays an essential role in the perception of space. Thus, if we close our eyes when we find ourselves in an unfamiliar place, we lose the notion of our surroundings to a large extent. This is the case be cause our understanding of space is gained mostly through those distances we p erceive between objects and ourselves. This means that if we were incapable of evaluating the void separating us from objects—whet her by means of sight, or by touch or hearing—we would hav e no conception of space. It is precisely for this reaso n that we"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"30 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 5 need not only visible points of reference, we also need tactile and audible ones to measure the distance between ourselves and what we perceive. As you know, we are constantly deceived by our perc eption of our surroundings. Our interpretation of space is itself subject to illusion. For example, when we look into the distance, we have th e impression that things are smaller and closer to one another than they are in reality. We call this phenomenon perspective . Such an effect demonstrates quite well that the objects we see are not necessarily what they appear to be. Thus, a tree located about 2 km (1-1/4 miles) away will seem small, wher eas it may actually be ten or fifteen times your height. This illusion is due to the fact that we do not see things as they are in reality, but only as our mental faculties perceive and interpret them. It follows that space, like tim e, is a state of objective consciousness. Therefore, it is arbitrary and does not constitute a reality that we can rely upon. Since consciousness is immaterial, it follows that space is likewise immaterial in the absolute sense. Human beings make a mistake by trying to conquer it with material devices or instruments. Thus, when exploring interstellar space, we have invented increasingly p owerful telescopes. When penetrating cellular space, we have perfected elect ron microscopes. When mastering terrestrial space, we have conceived vari ous increasingly rapid modes of transportation. However, the most powerful telescopes can never cover the whole universe. Likewise, the most sophis ticated microscope can never fully perceive the immaterial essence impregn ating each cell; at best it allows us to observe only a few of its effects. As for the various modes of transport humans have designed, they have their own limits. Let us also note that they are used both to conquer space and to mas ter time. It is precisely for this reason that astronomical distances are measure d in light-years and average speed in kilometers per hour (or miles per hour); i n other words, in space-time units. SPACE-TIME: Over the centuries human beings have been involved in a veritable race against time. It is obvious that suc h a race is also a challenge to the mastery of space, because one of the greatest preoc cupations is to travel the maximum distance in a minimum amou nt of time. Thus, when we need to go to a specific place, we cannot help thinking of the duration of our trip because i t is often"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"31 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 5 important that we arrive as quickly as possible so as to carry out our plans as soon as possible. Because of this urgency, we have gotten into the habit of no longer living in the present moment, but we are alw ays anticipating the future. Our obsession in designing ever faster cars, trains , airplanes, and rockets is clear proof of this. It is certain that we will suc ceed some day in traveling at record speeds and that we will succeed in exerting considerable control over the space-time duality. However, from a mystical po int of view, we will not master it by resorting to science and technology, b ecause only consciousness can transcend the limits that time and space impose upon the physical bodies of human beings. Just as it is possible for our consciousness to tra vel in time and to have access to the past and even to the future of human history, it can likewise travel in space and project itself hundreds or thousands o f miles from the place where we are located physically. When we have taught you how to proceed toward this goal, it will be just as easy for you to perce ive what is happening at this very moment in Cairo, Jerusalem, or New Delhi, as i t is to recall scenes that you experienced in your childhood. Such a fact may seem incredible to you, and yet it is included never- theless among the mystical arts that Initiates have used for centuries to accomplish their work in serving humanity and to co mmunicate with the invisible world. Naturally, it requires the develop ment of certain faculties which transcend the possibilities of our objective self. Such an ability depends upon the transcendent powers of our psychic consciousness, because this form of consciousness is unlimited in its perc eptions and can extend itself into infinity. You will learn why and how in the higher degrees of your Rosicrucian studies. We hope that the study of this monograph and of the preceding one has made it possible for you to understand that time an d space do not constitute the basic elements upon which you must establish yo ur existence. We cannot ignore the relative importance accorded them in dai ly life, for it would be unreasonable for us to behave as though they wer e only illusions of our mental apparatus. However, we can consider them as simply arbitrary points of reference, made necessary by th e fact that we are incarnated in a physical body and we current ly live on the material plane.

When you have the opportunity, take a short fifteen -minute trip, following these instructions. First, travel along a road or p ath in a straight line. Then travel for the same length of time, only choose an agreeab le and varied route that is, if possible, in an inspiring natural setting. Again , note your impressions in both cases.
