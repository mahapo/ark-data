Such a subject has always fascinated phi losophers and mystics. Psychologists and psychiatrists are now quite inter ested in the analysis of mental processes; however, their investigations are often limited in that they do not sufficiently take into account the spiritual or igin of those processes. It is true that the study of human consciousness is infinitely complex, because, as J.C. Friedrich von Schiller writes in the following quot ation, it is very difficult to go back “to the source whence issue our ideas of ne cessity and of universality.” Nonetheless, we hope that the Rosicrucian teachings will enable you to better grasp this fascinating subject. Neither abstraction nor experience can bring us bac k to the source whence issue our ideas of necessity and of universality; t his source is concealed in its origin in time from the observer, and its super -sensuous origin from the researches of the metaphysician. But, to sum up in a few words, consciousness is there, and, together with its immutable unity, t he law of all that is for humans is established, as well as of all that is to be by us, for our understanding and our activity. The ideas of truth and of right prese nt themselves inevitable, incorruptible, immeasurable, even in the age of sen suousness; and without our being able to say why or how, we see eternity in ti me, the necessary following the contingent. It is thus that, without any share on the part of the subject, the sensation and self-consciousness arise, and the ori gin of both is beyond our volition, as it is out of the sphere of our knowled ge. —J.C. FRIEDRICH VON SCHILLER (1759-1805)"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"3 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 6 Dear Fratres and Sorores, We have devoted the preceding monographs to the stu dy of time and space because it is important for you to understand well that we deal with two concepts which have no counterpart in the spiritual world. In other words, they concern only our earthly life and the perception wh ich our physical senses give us of our material environment. This is why we have said that time and space correspond to an objective state of consciousness o r, if you prefer, to a product of our objective consciousness. Of what, then, does this for m of consciousness consist? This is the subject we shall examine today . OBJECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS: By definition, our objective consciousness is the totality of processes which enable us to per ceive and interpret the physical world. In this respect, the objective cons ciousness depends upon our five physical senses and upon the five objective fa culties that are associated with them—i.e., sight, hearing, touch, taste, and s mell. It also depends on our various mental processes—in other words, our memory , imagination, thinking, and, generally speaking, on mental potentials which psychologists designate by the term subjective functions . That is why Rosicrucians feel that the objective faculties and subjective functions form in their en tirety a single phase of human consciousness—in this instance, its objective phase . The purely objective aspect of our objective consciousness concerns the percept ion of impressions coming to us from outside; whereas its subjective aspect i s more particularly associated with the interpretation of these impressions and th e resulting mental activity. If these few remarks seem difficult to grasp at pre sent, do not be worried; they will be the subject of a much more detailed study i n a future degree. Within the framework of this Postulant Section, we want to draw your attention to the limited and illusory aspect of our objective consciousness. In effect, our five senses deceive us constantly and o ften lead us into error in our judgments. Moreover, they are unable to perceive ev erything that forms the vibratory ocean in which we are constantly immersed . For example, there exist numerous light waves which our vision cannot percei ve and interpret. To take the most obvious example, the infrareds and the ult raviolets make no impression on our objective consciousness. Yet it is impossibl e to deny their existence. Likewise, our hearing cannot perce ive sound waves exceeding a certain vibratory frequency. Depe nding on the situation, it may involve infra-sounds—that is,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 6 sounds whose vibratory frequency is extremely low—a s well as ultra-sounds, which belong by contrast to very high octaves of th e Universal Keyboard of cosmic vibrations. What applies to sight and hearing is also valid for taste and smell, because there exist foods which produce no taste, and fragr ances which manifest themselves by no precise odor. As for touch, it can also be misled by the texture and consistency of certain substances. Animals, on the other hand, see objects or colors which make no impression on our eyes, or at least which are not subject to any interpretation in our objective cons ciousness. Some of them— dogs and cats for example—hear sounds of which huma ns are totally unaware. This is likewise true of certain odors which we are completely unable to smell. What enables animals to perceive colors, sounds, an d odors that make no impression on us is not their objective faculties; rather it is their psychic faculties—which function completely naturally for them. Human beings also have these psychic faculties at our disposal, yet, unlike animals, we must develop them, or rather prod them out of the state of inactivity in which they have been left for too long. We will sho w you, in due course, how to achieve this. From the preceding, we can deduce that the objectiv e consciousness of human beings is limited in its field of experimenta tion and allows us to perceive only the lowest material forms on the vibratory pla ne. Moreover, as Heraclitus stated, matter is in a state of perpetual becoming. In other words, it is subject to constant modifications and is never, in a permanent way, what it appears to be. This means that the fundamental law of the material world is change. For example, certain carbon compounds are gradually transformed deep in the earth and become diamonds after several mill ennia. Furthermore, it is because of these different changes that carbon can be used with great precision to determine the age of the most ancient objects or bones. Contrasted with carbon, we have uranium, which, due to very specifi c reactions with some of its subatomic particles, is classified among rad ioactive elements. In that capacity, uranium constitutes a metal whose transfo rmations are extremely rapid. These two examples are simply meant to show you that matter changes constantly. I n fact, all material substances are in a state of either ev olution or involution, these two apparently opposite states be ing the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 6 two major phases of the cycle that matter follows i n its various processes of transmutation. Thus, even if we are not objectively aware of it, t here is not a single element of matter in the entire universe that is now what i t was only a few seconds ago. Likewise, each cell of our physical body is differe nt from what it was a few months ago and, within a very short time, it will b e different from what it is right now. Change, motion, and instability are thus the c haracteristics of the material world. Therefore, what we perceive through our obje ctive consciousness cannot be permanent or stable. In other words, our sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell convey to us sensations which, by virtue of their origin, are only reflections of the change, motion, and instability of our external environment. Consequently, our mental interpretation of the mate rial world cannot be trustworthy. That is why mystics have always emphas ized the fact that human beings must call upon the transcendent faculties if they want to know the mysteries hidden within them and around them. Unfor tunately, most people place all their faith in their physical senses, and only trust what they see, hear, touch, smell, and taste—saying in essence that noth ing exists for them beyond what they can perceive by means of their objective consciousness. It is for this reason that many people deny the existence of the s oul and, naturally, of God. By acting in this way, they destroy their psychic f aculties and close the doors to all impressions that transcend their sensory facult ies. THE SUBCONSCIOUS: Nonetheless, no one can deny that there exists within us a form of consciousness that is independe nt of our objective perception. For example, when we sleep, the various organs of our body continue to fulfill their role. Our heart keeps bea ting, our lungs keep breathing, our blood circulates at a normal rate, etc. This al l occurs because a phase of our conscious activity is still functioning, even when our objective and subjective faculties are inoperative. This phase of consciousn ess, which acts within us without our being aware of it, is none other than t he subconscious, for it is this phase which directs all involuntary functions of ou r body. In other words, it is under the influence of the subconscious that all in ternal activities take place in our body—from our general metabolism down to the work done by each one of our cells. It is a fact th at we are not in command of those internal activities, becaus e, even when using our will, we cannot keep our heart from beating,"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 6 our lungs from breathing, our blood from circulatin g, etc. This is because our subconscious does not depend in any way on our obje ctive consciousness to accomplish its work in the service of the physical body. Rather, it is under the control of Cosmic Consciousness, which is present i n our entire being. In accordance with the preceding explanations, huma n beings possess a dual consciousness: the objective consciousness, wi th its subjective aspect, and the subconscious. The objective consciousness conce rns the perception of the external world by means of our five sensory faculti es on the one hand, and the mental interpretation of this perception on the other hand. It is therefore associated directly with our state of wakefulness a nd with voluntary actions we may exert over our physical surroundings. Due to it s very nature and role, the objective consciousness is governed by our brain an d is primarily concerned with our physical body. It is therefore limited and mortal. The subconscious, on the other hand, directs all our involuntary func tions and works under the direct control of Cosmic Consciousness. It is throu gh this intermediary that we may receive psychic impressions which our objective faculties cannot perceive. By its very nature it is unlimited and immortal, be cause it is closely associated with the consciousness of the soul. In the next monograph we will complete our present study of conscious- ness—or at least what we want to state concerning t his subject in this section. We will also give you a few simple but important ex periments so that you may develop a faculty indispensable for a mystic—namely , intuition. Meanwhile, we recommend that you direct your attention to your perceptions involving sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste, so that you will realize to what extent they involve a limited aspect of your conscious life. As you engage in this exami- nation, think of the infinite possibilities of your subconscious. In this way, you will understand that you are indeed a dual bein g uniting a finite dimen- sion—that of the body—with an infinite dimension—th at of the soul. Such an understanding will constitute an important step in the mastery of cosmic laws.

Defer not till the evening what the morning may accomplish. —Unto Thee I Grant 7 In this monograph we have explained that human bein gs possess a dual consciousness: the objective consciousness and the subconscious. This duality can be demonstrated by the following two very simpl e experiments. The first consists of sitting comfortably and closi ng your eyes. Before you begin, make sure that the room in which you are sea ted is as silent as possible. Also make sure that it is not too brightly lit and that the temperature is normal so that you will not be disturbed by light or heat. In short, see to it that your physical senses are unaffected by the perception of some condition outside yourself. Then concentrate on your inner life—on yo ur breathing, the beating of your heart, and in general on all the internal f unctions to which you usually pay no attention. In this way you will become aware that your life is indeed divided into two worlds: the external and the inter nal. For the second experiment, mingle with a crowd as s oon as you have the opportunity. While amidst this large number of peop le, you can verify for yourself that, despite all the hubbub surrounding y ou and all the things you can see, hear, touch, and smell, you remain fully a ware of being an individual distinct from all others. This proves that, whateve r surroundings we are in at a given moment, we never lose awareness of our inne r personality. Such a realization shows that our conscious activity is du al. Later, we will show you that this duality applies to all levels of Creation ."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 Summary of This Monograph After carefully reading this monograph, read the fo llowing summary. It contains the major principles on which you are to reflect and me ditate in coming days. If any of the points are difficult to understand, refer to the ex planations given in this monograph. Moreover, we advise you to read this summary again immediately before your next sanctum period. The objective consciousness is the totality of pro cesses which enable us to perceive and interpret the physical world. In this regard, it depends upon our five physical senses and the five objective fac ulties that are associated with them, as well as upon our subjective functions —that is, our mental processes. Our five objective faculties—sight, hearing, touch , taste, and smell—do not perceive everything that forms the vibratory oc ean in which we are constantly immersed. This means that many vibration s are not subject to any interpretation on the part of our objective con sciousness. All material substances are in a state of either e volution or involution; these two seemingly opposed states being the two ma jor phases of the cycle followed by matter in its various processes o f transmutation. There is not a single element of matter in the ent ire universe that is now what it was only a few seconds ago. This is because the material world is characterized by change, movement, and instability. Most people only trust what they see, hear, touch, smell, and taste. By acting this way, they destroy their psychic faculti es and close the doors to all impressions which transcend their sensory facul ties. There exists within us a form of consciousness tha t is independent of our objective perception. It is the subconscious. Our subconscious directs all involuntary functions of our body and acts continuously under the control of Cosmic Consciousn ess, which is present throughout our being."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"NOTES 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Mandamus No. 7 CONCURRENCE 10 Intuition is a truly remarkable faculty, if only be cause of its many applications. It is one of the major functions of o ur Inner Self—or if you prefer, of Cosmic Consciousness—which permeates our entire being. Due to intuition, it is possible to gain knowledge that we cannot acq uire through conventional means. That is why Rosicrucians attach so much impo rtance to the development of intuition. We have been conditioned, by our trai ning at home and in school, to heed what others have said or written rather tha n our own intuition. It is absolutely necessary for us to correct this error, because such a way of thinking gives to our objective consciousness a supremacy, w hich deprives us of true wisdom. In concurrence with this point of view, we cite the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson, a great poet and mystic of the 19th century. To believe your own thought, to believe that what i s true for you in your private heart is true for all men—that is genius. S peak your latent conviction, and it shall be the universal sense; for the inmost in due time becomes the outmost, and our first thought is rendered back to us by the trumpets of the Last Judgment. Familiar as the voice of the mind is to each, the highest merit we ascribe to Moses, Plato, and Milton is that they set at naught books and traditions; and spoke not what men, but what they t hought. A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because it is his. In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come b ack to us with a certain alienated majesty. Great works of art have no more affecting lesson for us than this. They teach us to abide by our spontaneous imp ression with good-humored inflexibility then most when the whole cry of voice s is on the other side. Else, tomorrow a stranger will say with masterly good sen se precisely what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forc ed to take with shame our own opinion from another. —RALPH WALDO EMERSON (1803-1882)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 7 Dear Fratres and Sorores, In the previous monograph we have seen that humans are endowed with an objective consciousness that includes our five obje ctive senses and the whole of our subjective functions, and with a subconsciou s that operates under the control of Cosmic Consciousness, which is present t hroughout our being. From a psychological and mystical point of view, th is is completely accurate; however, you should not conclude from this that we are animated by four totally distinct forms of consciousness. In other w ords, we do not possess an objective consciousness, a subjective consciousness , a subconscious, and a Cosmic Consciousness operating in a completely inde pendent way. In fact, there exists only one consciousness in humans—Cosmi c Consciousness—and it is only in its manifestations that it is multipl e in character. By way of analogy, there exists in the absolute onl y one light, which, in the present case, is the light of the sun. Only when th is light is refracted, as in the rainbow for example, does it appear to us in the fo rm of different colors. This is likewise true with human consciousness. Its phas es are only effects produced by Cosmic Consciousness when it is channeled throug h our various psychic centers and through our various mental processes. Y ou will find a diagram illustrating this point in the Practical Applicatio n of this monograph. COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS: The preceding observation leads us now to consider a very important mystical principle. Since the universal flow of Cosmic Consciousness enters into every human being, and si nce that Consciousness by definition is that of the Cosmic, it follows that w e are never separated from the Cosmic. Moreover, the Cosmic represents the tot ality of natural, universal, and spiritual laws by which Divine Intelligence exp resses itself throughout Creation. Consequently, we are permanently united t o that Intelligence and we possess it in the innermost part of ourselves. This also implies that all people are united with one another on the inner level, bec ause all are animated by Cosmic Consciousness and are constantly connected w ith the Divinity. Let us use an analogy to help you understand this p rinciple better. For this purpose, imagine the flow of Cosmic Consciousness a s an electrical current and Divine Intelligence as the generator of this cu rrent. Now visualize tens, hundreds, thousands of electric light bulbs connected on this same circuit. In this analo gy it is"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 7 obvious that the current feeding each one of these bulbs is the same and that it comes from a single source, even though the light e mitted by the bulbs differs due to their wattage or the color of their glass. I f you now consider that these bulbs represent human beings, you will understand t hat the same flow—that of Cosmic Consciousness—enters each of them and tha t each one manifests, according to his or her spiritual evolution, the po wer and intensity of that flow to some degree. Let us now consider another important point. On sev eral occasions we have stated that humans possess within themselves consci ousness of the Cosmic, which is called either Cosmic Consciousness or Universal Consciousness in our teachings. This consciousness is, for obvious r easons, in the image of its source—in other words, perfect. Consequently, it co ntains all the wisdom of the universe and includes knowledge of the past, pr esent, and future, of all humanity, and of our own existence. You may find it difficult to conceive that the future can be inscribed in Cosmic Consciousness . However, we will explain to you later that this truth does not contradict th e idea that all of us have free will at our disposal and that we remain the creator s of our own future. Rather, for now, we wish to show you that each of us, becau se of the presence within of Cosmic Consciousness, possesses the key to all m ysteries of the universe and of our own life. INTUITION: In the preceding monograph we have emphasized the fact that we cannot attain knowledge of these Mysteries by me ans of our objective faculties, because they only apply to the perceptio n and interpretation of the material world—in other words, to the visible and t angible world. If we want to acquire knowledge of the Mysteries, we must ther efore call upon those faculties which, because of their nature, transcend the limited powers of our mind. Among these faculties one of the most use ful for every mystic is intuition, because it is one of the major functions of Cosmic Consciousness in humans. To make it effective, we only need to quiet the objective reasoning and listen to our Inner Self. In this way it is possibl e to receive a reply to specific questions we ask ourselves, provided that these que stions are legitimate and acceptable from a cosmic point of view. We indicate that these are specific questions because this faculty h as its own limitations, and thus the solution to certain probl ems can only be obtained through meditation. We will see ho w this is accomplished in the next monograph."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 7 Intuitive impressions are neither limited nor affec ted by our five physical senses, although they are subject to interpretation when translated by our mental processes. On the other hand, time and space have n o influence over them, and no material condition can prevent them from manifes ting in us. Moreover, contrary to what is commonly thought, it is entirel y possible to develop our intuition and to benefit from its assistance in our lives. As we previously indicated, we need only grant greater importance to our inner consciousness and develop the habit of establishing a dialogue with it. We propose, therefore, that you try the following experiments whenever you have an opportunity during the upcoming months or even in the years to come. As you will see, these exercises are very effective in awakening our intuitive perception; they constitute in themselves a technique that you will find very useful. EXPERIMENTS: Whenever you wish to know the time, refrain from consulting a watch or clock. Instead, close your ey es and concentrate for a few seconds on the question: “What time is it?” Then r emain passive for a few moments and place yourself in a state of inner rece ptivity. If you succeed, the exact time will suddenly come into your consciousne ss, or you will have the impression that it is a certain number of minutes b efore or after a given hour. Note carefully the first intuitive impression which comes to you and then verify its accuracy by consulting your watch and other wat ches, for you will find on occasion that your watch may be running fast or slo w. It is possible that you may be tempted to reject a precise hour which comes to you intuitively by considering that this hour ca nnot be the correct one, since, according to your reasoning, it is not logical in r elation to the time when you last looked at your watch. In this case, do not cas t doubt on your intuition; instead trust it and take it into account. In other words, do not allow yourself to be influenced by this kind of reasoning, because yo u will note that impressions coming just after an intuitive response always resu lt from our objective consciousness and not from our inner consciousness. You should not limit your experiment to time. If yo u hear the telephone ring at home or work, instead of answering immediat ely, wait a few seconds and ask your inner self: “Who is calling me?” or “W hat is the subject of this call?” After asking the questio n, wait a moment for the answer, and once again strive to be receptive to your intuition. As you do so, remember that the first impression received is the one you must accept, eve n if"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 7 it seems strange to you. This will prevent you from getting into the habit of trusting a second or third impression which may occ ur to you. If your replies are inaccurate at first, do not be discouraged; con tinue your attempts until you notice that the impressions received become increas ingly accurate. The same process may be applied with the mail sent to you. If you receive a letter with no outward sign of the sender’s ident ity or of the letter’s contents, hold the envelope in your hand for a moment, close your eyes, and ask yourself for a few seconds: “Who wrote this letter?” or “Wha t is the subject of this letter?” Place yourself in a state of receptivity a nd wait for the results of your intuition. Then open your mail and verify whether y our intuitive perception was correct or not. When carrying out these experiments, it is very imp ortant that you avoid any reasoning and that you listen to the first answ er which arises in your consciousness. Your intuition must be developed in such a way that, as soon as it expresses itself, you no longer allow any obj ective reasoning to replace or even to modify the intuitive impression given to you. If you succeed, there will come a time when this faculty will function wi th such rapidity that at the very moment you ask the question, its reply will co me to you immediately. At first, you will find that a certain number of er rors do occur. This is because your intuition lacks development. It is also probab le that you will obtain such vague or fleeting impressions that you will not hee d them and will retain in their place a reply from your reasoning. However, y ou will gradually find that proper concentration and receptivity will allow you r intuitive perception to express itself with increasing accuracy. With these fundamental experiments we will end toda y’s study. Give them your full attention, because, as we will show you in the next monograph, they constitute the first approach to wh at our Tradition calls Cosmic Attunement.

As you will note , what is said regarding the different phases that should be obser ved during meditation is in full agreement with the technique that Rosicruci ans use for meditating. We recommend that you give your complete attention to the following quotation. Inspiration is the very heart, the central force of all meditation. Since inspiration is a spontaneous faculty (also interpre ted as “rapture”), it cannot be created on command, but only induced by arousing our interest or our admiration. Thus, before we can get inspired, we mu st prepare the ground, create the mood, the receptivity of the mind, and f or this there are two requirements: relaxation, quietness, peace, and har mony on the one hand and, on the other, something that gives direction and co ncentration to the mind, i.e. either a mental subject or a visible object of cont emplation that is sufficiently attractive to hold the attention of the meditator. The beauty of nature or of a poem, a moving prayer as a devotion al chant, the remembrance or the image of a charismatic perso nality or an Enlightened One in whose footsteps one wishes to follow, all th ese are conducive to meditation. Other good preparations are music, ince nse, flowers, and light, or the ritual of offering them in a temple or at a shr ine (as was usual in every Tibetan home, as well as in most Indian homes of Bu ddhists and Hindus alike). In short, the elements of beauty and devotion are t he most powerful incentives of meditation. Both these elements are united in Ti betan Thankas, which may explain the strange fascination they exert on the m odern mind and especially those interested in spiritual values and meditative practices. For devotional temperaments prayer itself becomes an entrance to m editation; in fact, prayer in a deeper sense, as a “direction of the heart,” i s itself a form of meditation. Whatever we love becomes an easy subject of contemp lation, because it requires no effort, but follows the natural inclina tion of mind and heart.

The following bookl et, entitled Neophyte Guide—Rosicrucian Initiation , contains very important information for the continuation of your Rosicrucian studies. Furthermo re, it provides basic explanations regarding the traditional stage throug h which you will be passing very soon and which will make you a Neophyte of our mystical Order. Do not neglect its study. Absorb its contents well. In the preceding monograph we offered some simple e xperiments to awaken your intuition and to release it from its la tent state. We sincerely hope that you have given the experiments sufficient atte ntion, because they form the basis of development for your intuitive perception and of a practice which our teachings have designated as Cosmic Harmonization . This traditional expres- sion refers to an inner state resulting from a perf ect harmonization between human consciousness and Cosmic Consciousness. In th is respect, the awak- ening of intuition is not the only experiment Rosic rucians can perform as part of Cosmic Harmonization. Contacts with the Celestia l Sanctum and the work of the Silent Council are fully integrated within t his framework, because these contacts and this work require that we harmonize wi th the loftiest planes of Cosmic Consciousness. This is likewise true of medi tation which, as we will now see, constitutes an art of considerable importa nce in the realm of mysti- cism. This art is based on the fundamental principl es of intuition; however, the revelations it allows us to obtain have a much more important significance. MEDITATION: First of all, it is important to understand that m editation has absolutely nothing to do with daydreaming. In other words, in its mystical application, meditation does not correspond to a su bjective state where we give free rein to our fantasy. In this sense, its aim is not to escape from the material world or to take flight from mundane problems; it i s rather to rise voluntarily into the spiritual world so as to gain access to it s light. It thus constitutes a form of Cosmic Harmonization whose goal is either t o secure the answer to a particular question or the solution to a precise problem, or to make oneself receptive to the inspirations that Cosmic Conscious ness is willing to give us. To meditate, it is not necessary to go to a church, a synagogue, a mosque, or any other edifice that peop le have"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 8 dedicated to religious life. It is possible to medi tate anywhere, whether in a room of a house or outdoors, provided that you have the required tranquility. In that respect, the most sacred temple is none other than the human being, because within our own inner depths is found the key to all the mysteries. However and wherever we are, we can commune inwardly and place ourselves in harmony with the God we are capable of conceiving and of lo ving, independent of any religious belief. Before coming to the technique you should follow fo r meditating effectively, we would like to emphasize that all me ditation should take place on the level of the Celestial Sanctum. In other wor ds, Rosicrucians should go to this symbolic place whenever we wish to harmo nize ourselves with the Cosmic. The method we taught you concerning this in the booklet Liber 777— The Celestial Sanctum is particularly effective for producing this desire d Inner State. Any mystical experience carried out on this plane becomes integrated in a work, which, as you will recall, is opened and cl osed by two invocations that are very significant within the Rosicrucian Traditi on. These two invocations convey an intent which reflects our desire to work in the service of Divine Intelligence and to place this work under the aegis of the Rosy Cross. They also symbolize the allegorical framework in which we pla ce our period of cosmic harmonization. That is why you will always use thes e invocations from now on to begin and end your meditations. However, you can meditate without feeling compelled to rise beforehand to the level of the Ce lestial Sanctum even though your communion with the Cosmic will be more meaning ful if you ascend to that Exalted Place. In the previous monograph we explained that conscio usness, in the form manifesting in human beings, operates according to phases which differ and yet are dependent on one another. Considering that the aim of meditation is to harmonize oneself with Cosmic Consciousness, it is quite evident that we must transcend the objective level on which we are situa ted in our waking state. In other words, it is impossible to meditate if our se nsory faculties are fully active or if our mental system is engaged in reasoning abo ut multiple facts. Thus, the first thing to do to carry out a successful med itation is to lose consciousness of our earthly surroundings o n the one hand, and, on the other hand, to place ourselve s in as calm a subjective state as possible, on the very ed ge of our subconscious. These two major conditions are requir ed for"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 8 the establishment of an inner dialogue with the Cos mic Consciousness which infuses the universe as well as our entire being. To help you understand the method to be used for ef fective meditation, we will now bring to your attention the basic techn ique of this art, as was transmitted to us by the Masters of our Tradition. As you will note, the technique is quite simple, as it is not necessary to perform complicated procedures so as to enter into contact with Cosmic Consciousness. Ev erything is simple in the absolute; it is human beings who, because of our mo mentary ignorance, make things far more complex than they are. Here is the technique we urge you to follow as faithfully as possible. EXPERIMENT: When you wish to enter into meditation, the first t hing to do is to retire to a quiet and peaceful place. If y ou meditate at home, take care to select a room where you have the necessary tranq uility, because it is very disagreeable, on both the physical and psychic leve l, to be disturbed during meditation. Also make sure that the room temperatur e is moderate, so that you feel comfortable. Similarly, the lighting must be s ubdued so that your sight will not be subjected to any outside influence. In short, make certain that the place you have selected for meditation stimulates a s little as possible your five physical senses and the objective faculties corresp onding to them. Once these conditions are met, sit with your back a s straight as possible, the palms of your hands upon your knees, and your f eet flat on the ground, slightly apart. If you meditate outdoors, the posit ion you assume should be as comfortable as possible, for the body must not b e subject to tension or discomfort. Once again, you must keep your back as straight as possible. As soon as you have assumed the desired position, c lose your eyes and take a series of deep neutral breaths for approximately one minute. Neutral breathing consists of inhaling and exhaling deeply through th e nose without any pause between inhalations and exhalations. We will explai n to you later why we use this type of breathing when preparing ourselves for meditation. We can tell you that this method is especially effective in inducin g a state of consciousness most favorable for this kind of experiment. We call thes e breaths neutral , as there are also deep positive and deep negative types of breat hing, which will be taught to you later in your studies. After about one minute of deep neutral breathing, r esume your normal breathing and rise to the level of cons ciousness"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 8 symbolized by the Celestial Sanctum, after having m ade certain to recite the opening invocation. When you feel that you have rea ched that plane, concen- trate on the purpose of your meditation. If it conc erns a question you wish to have answered, repeat this question mentally sev eral times as clearly and concisely as possible. If the problem is one of dee p concern and whose solu- tion you cannot conceive, summarize it mentally whi le trying, once again, to be as clear and concise as possible. Finally, if you wish to meditate merely to benefit from Peace Profound and from the general inspiration which any cosmic harmo nization can bring, you will not need to concentrate on the goal of your me ditation. Simply remain perfectly calm and receptive so that Cosmic Conscio usness may impress within you the revelations it intends for you. After concentrating for a few minutes upon the ques tion or problem which is the subject of your meditation, place yourself i n a state of absolute passivity. In other words, do not think about this question or problem any longer; let yourself drift into a feeling of perfect fusion wit h Cosmic Consciousness. This state of passivity is necessary when we meditate up on a specific goal, because it enables our question or problem to be transferre d to Cosmic Consciousness through the intermediary of our subconscious. Witho ut this transfer, the object of our meditation remains in the subjective aspect of our objective consciousness and, consequently, cannot receive a r esponse from the Cosmic. Once you feel the desire to end your meditation per iod, slowly return to objective consciousness, open your eyes, recite the closing invocation of the Celestial Sanctum, and resume your regular activiti es. As this experiment shows, the purpose of meditation is to use the subconscious to bring about a mental transfer. In t his regard, you will note that the first phase of this transfer occurs from o ur objective consciousness toward Cosmic Consciousness, and the second phase o ccurs from Cosmic Consciousness toward our objective consciousness. G enerally, the answer or solution sought is given to us during the passive p hase of meditation—that is to say, when we are in a receptive state. However, it often happens that we feel the inner urge to close our me ditation even before we receive an answer or solution. In th at case, an answer or solution is most often given to us in the form of a strong intuition when we have resumed our acti vities."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 8 In some unusual cases, it comes to us by way of our dreams. What is certain is that any meditation practiced according to the trad itional method that we have just indicated is effective and never leaves us wit hout a solution or answer. THE AKASHIC RECORDS: We will now consider a very important point. When we meditate simply to communicate with the spi ritual world and to receive certain inspirations from it—and not for th e purpose of obtaining the answer to a question or the solution to a probl em—our meditation often contains various impressions, some of which may be connected to past events that were significant in the history of humanity or the universe. We are pointing this out because experience proves that this is not as rare as we might think at first glance. Many Initiates have had visions of th e past in the course of very inspiring meditations. This can be explained very s imply. Cosmic Consciousness, in the image of human conscio usness, possesses an important attribute: memory. This memory is univ ersal and consequently contains all that the universe and humanity have ex perienced since the beginning of time. In numerous traditions—particula rly the Eastern traditions—this Universal Memory, which is also cal led Cosmic Memory , is designated by the Sanskrit word Akasha . Rosicrucian Tradition asserts that this memory constitutes the archives of the universe and , for that reason, uses the term Akashic Records . From a Rosicrucian point of view, the Akashic Recor ds are the indelible and eternal annals of the Cosmic. They contain the entire knowledge of humanity’s past and present. By attuning with Unive rsal Memory, we can gain access to these symbolic records and consult the pa ges concerning the most remote events marking the history of humanity and t he evolution of life itself. This explains how great Initiates could learn, in t he course of their meditations, how the submersion of Atlantis and the exile of the survivors of that lost continent occurred; how the Primordial Tradition wa s transmitted through space and time; how the ancient Egyptians built the ir temples and pyramids; and many other mysteries which defy human reason. S ome of our teachings are composed of these mystical revelations, which t he Rosicrucian Masters of our Order received when they were meditating on the great truths of existence. In coming days, we will encourage you to meditate b y following the instructions we have just given you. Choose"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Postulant Section Mandamus Number 8 a question or a problem of a material, personal, so cial, or purely philosophical nature and submit it to your meditation. In other w ords, entrust it to the Cosmic Consciousness which, for all the reasons we have ex plained to you, necessarily knows the answer or solution. You must understand t hat anyone who masters the art of meditation gains access to all the knowl edge which has accumulated in the Akashic Records since the beginning of time, and this person senses possibilities the future has in store for humanity. That is why you must not neglect this practice which, when it is well unders tood and well applied, enables human beings to transcend momentarily the l imitations of time. Before we part, let us remind you once again that o ur teachings, as transmitted to you in the monographs you have recei ved, are absolutely confidential.

It contains the major principles on which you are to reflect and me ditate in coming days. If any of the points are difficult to understand, refer to the ex planations given in this monograph. Moreover, we advise you to read this summary again immediately before your next sanctum period. Cosmic Harmonization refers to the inner state res ulting from a perfect harmonization between human consciousness a nd Cosmic Consciousness. The awakening of intuition, contacts with the Celestial Sanctum, the work of the Silent Council, meditation, and, generally speaking, all mystical experiences undertaken within the framework of our Order are integrated into Cosmic Harmonization. Meditation does not correspond to a subjective sta te in which we give free rein to our fantasy. It constitutes a Cosmic Harmon ization whose goal is either to secure the answer to a particular ques tion or the solution to a precise problem, or to make oneself receptive to the inspirations that Cosmic Consciousness is willing to give us. All your meditations should be carried out on the level of the Celestial Sanctum, because the method which allows you to ris e toward this symbolic Exalted Place is particularly effective in producing the desired inner state. The purpose of meditation is to use the subconscio us to bring about a transfer between the objective consciousness and Co smic Consciousness. Without this transfer, meditation cannot be effecti ve. Cosmic Consciousness possesses a Memory which Rosi crucian Tradition refers to as the Akashic Records . These allegorical records, which we can consult by means of meditation, contain all the kno wledge of humanity’s past and present."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Postulant Self-Examination The following questions are presented only to allow you to determine your comprehension of the important points contained in the monographs of the Postulant Section.

Nevertheless, the faculty of thinking is as important in the initial stages o f meditation as any of the other factors involved in the process of meditation . This is clearly indicated in the first two factors of the most ancient defini tion of Buddhist meditation: vitarka, initial thought, and vicara, sustained tho ught; in other words, thinking and reflecting, the two aspects of discursive thoug ht. This gives direction, coherence, and concentration to our consciousness, whose stream of ever- changing thoughts, feelings, impressions, and image s we cannot stop, but only channel, restrict, and direct, by giving it a stron g incentive, a central point of interest or attraction . . . . * * * Thus, thinking and reflecting are only the beginnin g and lead to an intuitive state of consciousness in which the processes of th inking and reasoning come to an end and some kind of deeper vision or direct experience takes over. The first step in this direction is the experience of t he infinity of space, in which consciousness loses its limitations and leads to th e experience of the infinity of consciousness. This experience of boundless exte nsion and freedom leads to the realization of sunyata, which in the early P ali texts is described as the sphere of no-thing-ness (nancayatana). Beyond this no words can describe the actual experi ence of the meditator who, therefore, is described as having arrived at t he state of “neither- perception-nor-non-perception,” the realm of the ul timate limit of perception, because the distinction between the experiencer and the experienced object has disappeared; subject and object have become one , perfect unification (samadhi) has been achieved. —ANAGARIKA BRAHMACARI GOVINDA (1898-1986)"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Consecrated to truth and dedicated to every Rosicrucian Grand Lodge of the English Language Jurisdiction, AMORC, Inc.
