In concurrence with this monograph, dedicated to the study of telepathy as it is used by Rosicrucians, w e suggest that you read this example, because it illustrates perfectly what our Order has taught for centuries about mental communication. The “elders” to whom th e author refers were members of a Muslim secret society. English reports on the war waged in India in connec tion with the revolt of the Sepoys relate a very strange fact. Indian bazaa rs always had the news of battles and of their outcome two hours before the t elegram had brought them. That is traceable to the psychic communication proc ess used by all Orientals, a process enabling them to cancel time and space. In support of this, the following is the account of an adventure which happened to M. Ferdinand de Lesseps: “The speed with which news is transmitted in Arab c ountries is marvelous. Here is a striking example which we witnessed. In M arch 1883, M. Ferdinand de Lesseps, at the time of his exploration of the s alt lakes of southern Tunisia for the Inland Sea, landed in the morning at Sfax. I led him to the mosque and introduced the Muslim dignitaries to him. We said t he prayer together. Then M. de Lesseps announced to them that he was the bea rer of a letter from Abd- el-Kader recommending Colonel Roudaire’s plan. He r ead it. In the evening, he re-embarked, and the next day, at the first hour , landed at Gabès. Now, from Sfax to Gabès, it takes seven days of march by land . . . . Yet, when on the very evening of his arrival at Gabès, M. de Les seps visited the village of Menzel where waiting for him was the djemmaa, the c hief of the elders, who congratulated him on the letter from the emir. The good news, he said, had reached him from Sfax during the day.” —DR. GÉRARD ENCAUSSE (1865-1916)"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"3 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Neophyte Section Atrium 1 Number 12 Dear Fratres and Sorores, The creative power of visualization is not limited to obtaining the realization of a desire or the materialization of a wish that is particularly close to our heart. As you will discover for yourse lf when progressing in the Rosicrucian studies, the creative power of visualiz ation serves as the basis for a large number of mystical practices and constitutes the key to those “miracles” attributed to Masters of the past. Thus, you should accord great importance to the contents of the preceding monographs and let yo urself be permeated by them as much as possible. In this regard, do not li mit yourself to reading them only once for, as we have reminded you on several o ccasions, simply having an intellectual knowledge of a spiritual principle is not sufficient for you to be in a position to apply it successfully in your l ife. It must become a part of yourself and guide each of your thoughts, words, and actions. Constantly bear in mind that mysticism is not an intellectual pastime; it is an inner state that must be reflected in your daily behavior and a ttract towards you the most positive situations. Telepathy, the process of communicating at a distan ce by means of thought, is among those mystical practices requiring the use of visualization. There are two basic methods used to establish such communicat ion. The first involves a perfect mental harmonization between two individu als—a transmitter and a receiver. Telepathy is based on a transmission of t hought carried out between the objective consciousness of each of these subjec ts. For such transmission to take place between them, it is necessary for the se cond person to know that the first wishes to communicate, because this method ca n only succeed if the two people concerned willingly put themselves on the “s ame wavelength.” It is obvious that this form of telepathy, although very effective, is limited, because it implies a previous understandin g between the person who transmits and the one who receives. Yet it is not a lways possible to bring this understanding about. That is why Rosicrucians have used over the centuries a second method which, unlike the first, does not n ecessitate a previous agreement between the transmitter and receiver. Thi s method is based on a practice which consists of using the Cosmic Conscio usness to project a precise mental message to the subconsciou s of the person for whom we intend it."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Neophyte Section Atrium 1 Number 12 We explained to you in the Postulant Section that e ach human being does not truly have an individuality distinct from other s, because all people are animated by an emanation from the Universal Soul an d possess within them the same flow of consciousness—that of Cosmic Consc iousness. We all bathe in the same vibratory ocean. We are all linked by o ur spiritual nature and, whether we are aware of it or not, are affected by the emotions and thoughts of others. It is precisely this relationship which allows us to communicate with one another no matter how far apart we may be. This means that we all have the power to use Cosmic Consciousness to trans mit a mental message to others. Naturally, such transmission requires the m astery of a certain technique, and it is that technique we wish to present to you today. As you will note, it constitutes a specific application of the method us ed to obtain the realization of a desire by means of visualization. PROJECTING A MENTAL MESSAGE: 1) When you wish to transmit a mental message to a specific person, first define the nature of the message clearly. It should be as simple and concise as possible. It is imperative that the message be c omposed of a minimum of words and that these words be very evocative. Final ly, it involves giving the message the form of a mental telegram, which summar izes only the essential ideas you wish to transmit. 2) After clearly defining your message, visualize t he person to whom you wish to send it. Take into account the instructions that we gave previously to make your visualization effective. See that person as though you were really in his or her presence. Mentally observe this perso n’s general build, and then the face with all of its characteristics. Visualize your subject’s voice, laugh, perfume (if normally worn), etc. Imagine this perso n with as much realism as if you were physically in his or her presence. 3) Once the visualization is quite clear and you tr uly have the impression of being in this person’s presence, repeat your messag e several times, mentally or in a low voice, as if you were really nearby; sp eaking directly to him or her. While doing this, imagine that the individual sees and hears perfectly what you are mentally saying. See your subject smile or make a friendly gesture, showing that the recipient understood your message fully. 4) When you have repeated your mental message three or four times, while visualizing the person to whom you wis h to transmit"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Neophyte Section Atrium 1 Number 12 it, inhale deeply through your nose, hold your brea th for a few moments, then exhale slowly through your nose and say mentally or in a low voice: “This message is projected into the Cosmic to the attenti on of (give the full name of the person concerned). If it pleases the Cosmic, it is done!” 5) After having observed the previous instructions, forget your message and the person for whom it was intended, and place your trust in the Cosmic. The best way to succeed is to resume your normal activi ties. As was the case for the visualization, whose purpose was to project a desir e of what we wanted to be realized, the phase of forgetting is imperative. Th at is the essential condition for the message to be projected into the Cosmic Con sciousness so that it may, through its intermediary, reach the subconscious of the person concerned. RECEIVING A MENTAL MESSAGE: You may have asked yourself how others receive a mental message we have transmitted to them. Most often, it appears to them in the form of an intuition that ur ges them to contact us. If they are particularly receptive, they may even “hear” it with the same realism as if we had said it to them verbally and they may have t he distinct impression that we have spoken to them. In certain cases, the messa ge is fully received in one of their dreams and, if they are the sort of indivi duals who easily remember what they have dreamed, they will wake up thinking of you and of the message you have transmitted. In this regard, one of the best times to make menta l contact is when the other person is relaxed or asleep, because his or h er subconscious is then very active and faces no opposition from the objective c onsciousness. However, you may carry out this form of mystical telepathy at an y time of the day, when you feel most receptive on the inner level. There is al ways an interval of time— even just a few seconds—when any individual is rece ptive to the vibrations of our thoughts. Another question we may ask ourselves is this: How can the persons contacted know whether we were the source of the me ssage they received? The answer to this question is relatively simple. T he method used by Rosicrucians for communicating mentally with others is based on the premise that it is possible, no matter what the distance, to use Cosmic Consciousness as a medium to imprint certain ideas into the subconscious of an individual that we know well enough to visualize. The subconscious, unlike the objective c onsciousness, is"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Neophyte Section Atrium 1 Number 12 able to determine the source of all impressions it receives. Our subconscious is not limited by either time or space, and it perceiv es instantly the identity of any person who contacts us. The problem is not determining the person who seeks to communicate with us, or even the contents of the mental message this person is sending to us. Rather, the problem is transmitting such dual infor mation to our own objective consciousness. Hence the necessity to develop our i ntuition and, generally, our aptitude to establish a constant communion between our objective self and our spiritual self. As we become more intuitive and adept in communicating with our subconscious, the more capable we are in p icking up thoughts that are intended for us with a positive purpose. AN EXAMPLE OF MENTAL PROJECTION: Let us illustrate what we have just explained regarding the subject of tel epathy through mental projection. Suppose that you want a certain person to get in touch with you as quickly as possible, because you have an urgent pie ce of information to ask or transmit. This is how you proceed. Withdraw to a place that is as tranquil as possible and relax for a few minutes. Sit comfortably, with your back as straigh t as possible and your feet placed flat on the ground and slightly apart from e ach other. While you are in this position, take three or four deep neutral brea ths. Visualize the person concerned with as much realism as possible. As soon as you see him or her mentally, with as much clarit y, precision, and life as if you were truly in that person’s presence, say menta lly or in a low voice the mental message you wish to transmit: “Contact me as soon as possible!” While engaged in this visualization, repeat the message s lowly three or four times. When you feel that your concentration is at its pea k of intensity and that your visualization cannot be made any clearer, inhale de eply through your nose, hold the air in your lungs a few moments, and then exhal e slowly, still through your nose. After exhaling, say mentally or in a low voic e: “This message is projected into the Cosmic to the attention of (full name of the person concerned) . If it pleases the Cosmic, it is done!” Afterwards totally forget your message and the pers on for whom it was intended. Return to your activites with the inner conviction that Cosmic Law will be put into effect. You may repeat the whole process, projecting your message into the Cosmic, on"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Neophyte Section Atrium 1 Number 12 additional occasions. Simply pause for at least a h alf hour between sessions. In principle, two or three attempts should be sufficie nt to reach the subconscious of the person concerned, especially if he or she is receptive at that moment. This is a simple application of the way in which Ro sicrucians practice telepathy. We are convinced that you will understan d its importance, for you have surely been in the position where you wanted t o contact a person whom you could not reach by usual means of communication . Apart from this specific example, there are a great many circumstances where mental projection may prove to be very useful. During the days, weeks, an d months to come you will discover for yourself that many situations may requ ire its use. As was the case for the visualization of a desire, do not expect to be completely successful in your first attempts. Such a faculty requires a certain training. First, you must attain a good level of vi sualization, and second, you must have complete familiarity with the method to b e followed. Also keep in mind that the person to whom you sent your message may not be in a receptive state at that moment, or this individual will have perceived your message and yet did not take it into account or did not follow his or her intuition. Whatever the results obtained, do not be discouraged. During the next several days, we suggest that you t ransmit simple mental messages to persons you know quite well and whom yo u will have an opportunity to meet later. To give an example: Sele ct one person and, following the method we have just indicated, mentally ask him or her to telephone you for news or to share some of his or her own news. With another person, follow the same process in order to transmit to him or her you r wish to receive a friendly letter. Finally, suggest to a third person that he or she pay you a visit. Even if you sometimes have the impression that you have failed in the projection of your mental messages, you will probab ly be surprised during some future conversation to hear these individuals exclaim to you: “It’s funny, but I thought a lot about you on that day!” You wil l then have confirmation of your success.

A mental message is generally perceived in the form of intuition, a strong impression, or a dream. In this regard, one of the best times to make mental contact is when the other person is rel axed or asleep, for the subconscious is then very active and does not face any interference on the part of the objective consciousness.

It is not limited by time or space and instantly perceives the identi ty of any person trying to contact us."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"First Atrium No. 13 CONCURRENCE 10 Theophrastes Paracelsus, an eminent Rosicrucian of the 16th century, wrote a great deal on black magic and superstition. Since this monograph is directly linked to the study of these subjects, we propose t hat you read an excerpt from a work that is devoted to them. As you will note, h e attributed the origin of beliefs, which have kept humans the prisoners of th e most primitive ideas, to credulousness and foolishness. He devoted his entir e life to fighting against ignorance because, according to him, it is ignoranc e which is responsible for all the forms that evil can take on Earth. Centurie s have passed since the death of this great mystic, yet the goal of Rosicrucian t eachings remains the same: to spread Knowledge among humans, thus liberating u s from prejudice and primitive conceptions which prevent us from being h appy and from evolving toward a better comprehension of our divine origin. By means of estimation and imaginations many supers titions are fulfilled, which are not impressions, or incantations, or esti mations, simply superstitions capable of being understood by a similar example. I suppose myself imbued with the superstition that when I hear crows chatte r on my roof I consider it the sign of someone’s death (there are many similar examples which need not be quoted). This superstition may make me ill mysel f, or kill my sick friend, the cause whereof I set down in my treatise on Supersti tions. My method of observation is this: I regard such cha ttering as natural, and that it does not operate according to the foolish i deas of humans. By this means, my superstition is destroyed, for it is rendered do ubtful when I attribute it to my folly. Nothing destroys superstitions more thorough ly than considering them to be follies. Thus all harm is taken out of them. It is the consensus that leads to action, and this consensus is at once removed if I think of my own simplicity and the folly of such empty credulity. And this doe s not happen only in the case of crows; it happens with many other things, which it is not necessary, nor would be useful, to rehearse in a treatise on long life. Enough has been said on the subject of observations. —THEOPHRASTES PARACELSUS (1493-1541)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Neophyte Section Atrium 1 Number 13 Dear Fratres and Sorores, The subject of the previous monograph compels us to now consider a problem of great importance. Indeed, the method we have taught you for trans- mitting a mental message to another person may sugg est that any individual, by following an identical or very similar technique , may project negative thoughts toward us. Thus, the question we may then ask ourselves is this: Can we come under the influence of evil practices whose aim is to harm us? Should we believe in the existence of black magic? BLACK MAGIC: Before answering these questions, we must first as k ourselves if it is true that some people seek to do evil by means of the creative power of thought. Unfortunately, we are forced to a cknowledge that such is the case. There do exist some individuals who are k nown as “black magicians” who engage in practices intended to harm the victim s they have chosen or who have been indicated to them. Their ways of operatin g differ. Some of them use incantations or curses—magical words—which, accordi ng to them, possess the power to unleash demons and evil spirits agains t someone. Others make mysterious gestures and assert that these gestures set into motion destructive fluids capable of sowing unhappiness and grief. Sti ll others use photographs, effigies, statuettes, or various other objects and, through their mediation, claim that they can kill their victims, drive them mad, m ake them ill, burn their homes, destroy their herds, etc. Indeed, each of th ese servants of evil has his or her own technique, and, whether through words or ge stures, or even both at the same time, it is based most of all upon the power o f the mind. The question is, can this power be used effectively to destructive e nds? Rosicrucian Tradition asserts that it is impossible to use mind power to harm other persons at a distance, thus denying the influence that is sometimes attributed to black magic. Of course, as we have pr eviously mentioned, there are some individuals who do engage in evil practice s against certain subjects. However, it is not these practices, which, of thems elves, may cause evil; it is the fear they engender within the consciousness of superstitious individuals. Moreover, you will note that only those people who believe in their efficacy can become their victims. This may be explained by the fact that when certain people are convinced that they are und er a spell, they put themselves into a negative mental and emotional state that will, in effect, harm them in the end. In this case they are not under the"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Neophyte Section Atrium 1 Number 13 evil influence of the one casting the spells; rathe r they are under the influence of their own thoughts. Indeed, being convinced that someone wants to harm them, they poison their own minds and, without trul y being aware of it, adopt a bad form of behavior which eventually makes them ill or attracts painful situations to them. Therefore, we repeat, it is very important to under stand that the only power black magic possesses is what we give to it, because these practices have absolutely no power in themselves. Their effec tiveness lies only with the persons who lend them any credence, because the y subject themselves to negative autosuggestion. As we shall see in the Second Temple Degree, autosuggestion represents a great mental force whic h, if used wrongly, exposes us to many dangers that all originate from within o ur own consciousness. The greatest destructive power of the mind lies in the negative influence that our own mental attitude can exert upon us if w e give it the chance. Thus, without considering the example of black magic, it has been scientifically proven that when we constantly harbor negative thou ghts, we create within ourselves psychological and physiological condition s that contribute to the onset of illness—both mental and physical. When we begin the study of the Sixth Temple Degree, a degree devoted to the study of health and mystical healing, we will explain to you why this is so and show you that what scientists are now accepting is what Rosicrucians have claimed for centuries. Be that as it may, to protect yourself from those w ho claim to cause harm through the use of the mind, quite simply pay no at tention to them and maintain a positive mental attitude. Any person who refuses to believe in the efficacy of black magicians will not, under any circumstance, b e the victim of their evil practices. We can even add that it is the black mag ician who will suffer the harm they wish to inflict. Most individuals who try to harm others through malevolent practices end up by falling gravely ill, or even dying, because sooner or later they must suffer the consequences o f all the negative thoughts they have entertained. SUPERSTITION: We cannot bring up the problem of black magic witho ut considering the problem of superstition since, to a very large degree, it is that which gives to those practices t heir semblance of effectiveness. It is impossible to estimate the num ber of superstitious beliefs that have developed over the centuries; how ever, one thing"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Neophyte Section Atrium 1 Number 13 is certain: All, as Paracelsus stated, have their o rigin in human ignorance and none correspond to the workings of natural or unive rsal law. Let us take a few examples to illustrate this. In m any countries it is commonly thought that any person who breaks a mirro r will experience seven years of bad luck. This preconceived notion is so e ngraved in the consciousness of certain individuals that they are terrorized by the idea that it may happen to them personally or to any member of their family. Y et, logical analysis shows that there is no cause-and-effect connection betwee n breaking a mirror and experiencing misfortune. The best proof is that man y persons who happen to break a mirror, or even several mirrors, will conti nue to lead a perfectly happy existence. Conversely, you know very well that many ill-fated people have never broken a mirror. Along these same lines, it is ridiculous to think t hat the act of walking under a ladder will bring bad luck since, once agai n, there is no cause-and- effect relationship. The only reason that should pr ompt us not to walk under a ladder is prudence. Indeed, the presence of a ladde r generally indicates that a person is working overhead and that if we walk belo w, we risk being injured if a tool should fall. From a Rosicrucian point of view, this kind of superstition has its origin in erroneous thinking or an incorrec t association of ideas. Among superstitious beliefs, there are many that in volve animals. Thus, it is frequently said that encountering a black cat or a crow is a bad omen; that anyone hearing an owl hoot will have bad luck befor e long; or that it is a very bad omen to see a bat fly after the sun goes down. Such beliefs are absurd, and more serious still, they have given rise to acts of savagery. During past centuries black cats had their throats slashed and crows were poisoned. As for owls and bats, they were nailed to the doors of homes or bar ns. In certain regions such horrors are still committed, which proves to what e xtent superstitious beliefs are anchored in people’s mentality. It is obvious t hat no animal brings bad luck and that such sacrifices are the height of hum an meanness and stupidity. To claim the contrary would be like saying that Div ine Intelligence created animals which have in themselves the power to do ev il or to transmit evil. All animals, without exception, have their usefulne ss, and even if they appear frightening to us, each one has its part to play as part of the chain of evolution. In this regard, humans h ave no rights over them, except to respect and love them as they are. Moreover, all"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Neophyte Section Atrium 1 Number 13 those who mistreat animals or cause them to endure useless suffering—in the name of superstition or even science—create negativ e karma for themselves. Indeed, while it is false to believe that some anim als bring bad luck, it is true that anyone who causes some animal to suffer w ill someday experience misfortunes intended to make that person understand the cruelty of his or her own acts. As is the case with all superstition, those associa ted with animals are based on preconceived ideas and must be vigorously opposed. To return to the examples that we previously cited, it is good t o remember that the cat was venerated by the ancient Egyptians. The goddess Bas tet, who was represented with the features of this animal, was considered to be the benefactress and protectress of humanity. In ancient Greece both the crow and owl were under the protection of Athena, goddess of wisdom. As for t he bat, it is the symbol of happiness and of longevity in many Eastern tradi tions. In the past these animals were regarded with much respect and were so metimes the object of a religious cult. If these creatures were later lin ked to negative beliefs, it was due to the ignorance of human beings and to their i ncapacity to understand and respect all forms of life. While the color blac k has often been associated with evil, it is ridiculous to imagine that any obj ect or animal displaying that color is maleficent. Likewise, just because night, obscurity, and darkness traditionally represent the negative aspect of life , it should not be deduced that nocturnal animals are demoniacal and bring bad luck . What is involved here is, we repeat, a set of associations, or of ideas, without any philosophical or mystical foundation. Since an animal cannot bring bad luck, it is quite obvious that no animal exists which can bring good luck. The same is likew ise true of any object. Thus, fetishes, amulets, charms, talismans, medals, etc., have no power in themselves. It is incorrect to think that they c an bring luck, exorcise evil spells, serve as protection, or accomplish any othe r action favoring the person who wears them or places them in a specific spot in his or her house. Once again, such beliefs are based on superstitions that have been transmitted from generation to generation; they have absolutely no v alidity. If happiness depended solely on possessing a certai n object or having a certain animal by one’s side, it would imply that any individual having that object or animal could const antly violate"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Neophyte Section Atrium 1 Number 13 human and divine laws without the risk of experienc ing negative consequences. It is evident that this is in total contradiction t o the basic principles of mysticism, of spirituality and, in general, of life itself. It is also absurd to claim that if a person is experiencing misfortune, it is only becau se he or she possesses no good luck charm. When we begin the study of karma i n detail, you will fully understand that human beings individually and colle ctively reap what they sow and that their joys and miseries are due to the way in which they apply free will. Happiness has nothing to do with the wearing of a so-called potent object or the practice of a superstitious belief. All Masters of the past, whoever they may have been , opposed all forms of superstition, for they knew that such thinking gene rated fanaticism, intolerance, and disrespect for life. As a member of AMORC, cont inue their struggle and set the example of a balanced, thoughtful being ani mated by positive ideas having their source in the understanding and applic ation of cosmic laws. In this regard, your role is very important, for super stitious practices and beliefs are responsible for many misfortunes befalling huma nity. Therefore, whenever the occasion arises, you have the duty to show that these practices and beliefs have no foundation, and that they considerably dama ge the evolution of any so-called civilized society.

Yet fear, when it is reasonably founded, is an emot ion which plays a useful role in everyone’s life. Indeed, if human beings were in capable of experiencing this emotion, we would often place our lives in danger b y engaging in acts exceeding the limits of our physical or mental potential. In this sense, fear is truly the ally of a certain form of wisdom and constitutes the fou ndation of the instinct of self- preservation. What we regret is that fear has been used for servi le purposes for such a long time. For centuries fear was the basis of an education based on corporal punishment. However, when fear is used as the exclu sive means of forcing a child to recognize authority, whether that of the child’s parents or teachers, it arouses within the child feelings of submission and frustration. T he child often grows into an adult who may be dominated by false beliefs and superstition. The power of many religions has been to maintain it self and to continue to maintain itself by the use of dogmas based on the f ear of sin and the fear of eternal damnation. Such religions keep their worshipers ign orant of mystical laws and take advantage of their moral submission to cultiva te in them a permanent feeling of guilt. This involves a grave error, because peop le can evolve only by applying their free will and by learning to think for themse lves. From this point of view, rather than demanding blind submission to some comm andment, religious codes should explain how certain actions are harmful to t he individual or society. The spontaneous desire to do good should guide the fait hful—and not the fear of doing evil. These remarks are not an unconditional critic ism of religion as the vehicle of fundamental ethical and spiritual values; rather, t hey are the condemnation of all practices that use these values to dominate human b eings by maintaining fear and through the teaching of dogmatic, if not superstiti ous, beliefs.

Evildoers are the ones who will suffer the harm they wish to infl ict. All superstitions have their origin in erroneous re asoning or in an incorrect association of ideas that do not correspond to univ ersal or natural law. All those who mistreat animals or cause them to end ure useless suffering— either in the name of superstition or science—creat e negative karma for themselves. Anyone who causes an animal to suff er will someday experience misfortunes intended to make that person understand the cruelty of his or her acts. While it is false to believe that some animals brin g bad luck, it is quite obvious that none can bring good luck. The sa me is true for any object. Fetishes, amulets, charms, talismans, medal s, etc., have no power in themselves. Individually and collectively, people reap what the y sow, and their joys and miseries are due to the way in which they apply fre e will. Happiness has nothing to do with the wearing of a so-called poten t object or the practice of some superstitious belief."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"First Atrium No. 14 CONCURRENCE 18 The triangle has always been used to symbolize cert ain mystical laws and principles. In one of the Temple Degrees we will st udy its symbolism in detail and see that it varies according to the traditions and religions involved. Within the framework of this Atrium, we will limit ourselv es to examining the major law that it represents for Rosicrucians. Since this monograph is devoted to that study, we propose that you read an excerpt of a text found in our Order’s archives. You will note the Law of the Triangle hol ds a significant place in our teachings. All that has been, is, and will be is governed by t he Ternary, because it is the Ternary which unites the elements that natur e has opposed, so that, mutually complementing one another, they mix their potencies and give rise to what was not. At the beginning of time, the Unity e xisted alone in the Ineffable, yet already in its Thought, God had conceived multi plicity. Through its Verbum, it projected into infinity the Primordial Substance , and the One found in Two the mirror It was seeking. Then the Primordial Subs tance received the breath of Divine Essence, and it was then that out of the Fiat Lux surged the Three, and with it all the forms of life. And the human is one of the multiple reflections of the Ternary, because our Soul is only a segment of Divine Essence and our body a fragment of the Primordial Substance. And it is because we are Soul and body, One and Two, that we are a living and con scious being, manifesting in matter the third point of a Spiritual Triangle. And as we are also at the crossroads of Macrocosm and Microcosm, we are also in the center of a circle, the Universal Circle, which sets the limits of two triangles, the first looking toward Heaven and the second toward Earth. —ROSICRUCIAN ARCHIVES"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Neophyte Section Atrium 1 Number 14 Dear Fratres and Sorores, The method we have taught you for projecting a ment al message toward a specific person leads us to a very important myst ical law of the Rosicrucian Tradition: the Law of the Triangle. This method req uires the interplay of three fundamental points: the sender, Cosmic Consciousnes s, the receiver. If you refer to the diagram in the Practical Application o f monograph No. 12, the existence of these three points will seem obvious t o you. A simple analysis of this diagram clearly shows that it is impossible to transmit or receive a mental message if the corresponding triangle is not formed . Moreover, it is for this reason that no one can use the power of thought to exert a negative influence over you, because Cosmic Consciousness does not rel ay that kind of influence. On the contrary, it contributes to the transmission and reception of any positive mental impression. THE LAW OF THE TRIANGLE: Mental projection is only one application of the Law of the Triangle, as this law is universa l and applies to all that exists, whether on the material plane or the spiritual plan e. It is based on the premise that no perfect manifestation can be produced if tw o conditions of an opposite nature do not come together. Thus, the One , in the science of Numbers, represents only a beginning, a start, an initial co ndition needing its opposite to take on a complete expression or form. Without t he Two , the One remains in a latent state and can produce no true material or spiritual manifestation. That is why mystics have stated for centuries that all of Creation obeys the Law of Duality. When One and Two are placed in the presence of each other, they mutually attract, and from their union Three is born, a third condition, which, in itself, is the point of manifestation of the triangle thus formed. That third condition then possesses the qualities of the first two, while constituting a distinct entity. Let us take two simple examples to illustrate the L aw of the Triangle. In nature, life, with the exception of a few plant or animal species, cannot perpetuate itself without the union of two compleme ntary cells, male and female. As long as that union is not achieved, proc reation is not possible. If we consider the human species, we see that the birth o f a child results from the fusion of a spermatozoon and an ovum. That fusion is an example of the Law of the Triangle, because One , uniting with Two , produces Three , which is none other than the child itself. This"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Neophyte Section Atrium 1 Number 14 child, while a distinct entity from its father and mother, is genetically speaking a combination of the two. The same principle applies to the material world. A n electrical current possesses a positive phase and a negative phase, an d the union of these two phases produces electricity, such as we generally u se it. Once again, we see that the Law of the Triangle is the combination of two opposing conditions which produces a third, for without the encounter o f the negative and positive poles, no phenomenon of electricity can manifest in a tangible manner. Here is an important point: When One is put in the presence of Two and no internal or external agent opposes it, their uni on inevitably gives rise to Three . It is this finding that is the source of the sayi ng “Everything comes in threes.” Many sayings, despite their simple and fam iliar appearance, illustrate some of the greatest laws of nature and of the univ erse. When, for instance, the opposite poles of two magnets are brought together, an attraction is inevitable. The application of the Law of the Triangle to the p henomenon of magnetism results. If a ball is thrown against a wall, it wil l of necessity bounce back since the act of throwing a ball gives rises to an active force which, when in contact with the passive condition represented by the wall, produces a manifestation: the rebound. We could use a number of examples to show you that all manifestations result from the encounter of two conditions of an o pposite nature. When this encounter occurs in the world of living matter, the two forces in conjunction are described as male gender and female gender . When it is manifested in the realm of electricity or magnetism, we speak of positive polarity and negative polarity . When it is applied to physical or chemical phenom ena, we use the terms active principle and passive principle . Yet, no matter what terminology is used, the fundamental law involved is that of th e triangle. When the terms negative and positive are used in conjunction with the Law of the Triangle, it is important to understand that negative does not indicate a bad or harmful condition, in contrast to a good o r useful condition. In reality, the two words are relative and concern two polarities that are of equal importance in the application of this law on both t he material plane and the spiritual plane. If we consider once again the case of procreation, a man on his own cannot perpetuate lif e or give birth to children. Likewise, the positive phase of electr icity is insufficient"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Neophyte Section Atrium 1 Number 14 to produce an electrical current. As we indicated p reviously, the negative phase is indispensable. In general, every phenomenon or e very manifestation results from a duality having two poles, two aspects, or tw o elements whose function makes them complementary or indispensable to one an other. APPLYING THE LAW OF THE TRIANGLE: Does the Law of the Triangle have a practical value in our everyday aff airs? The answer, of course, is yes. Before starting on any new project, we can mentally set out our plans in the form of a triangle and very carefully define the two conditions we must combine in order to obtain the desired result. Such an analysis generally makes it possible to discern what we should do or not do, to say or not say so as to produce the third point, that of the manifestation we desire. Likewise, when we are confronted by a disagreeable test or situation, rather than enduring it and bemoaning our fate, we must determine what two conditions brought it about. Having done that, our task remains to cancel one of them so that this misfortune or situation may di sappear on its own. In some cases it is enough to act on the human level to pro duce this cancellation. In other cases, it must be created in the Cosmic by using th e power of visualization. Quite often it is best to join our own efforts to t he spiritual aid we may receive. The subject of health affords a good example to ill ustrate what we have just explained. Indeed, any illness, whether we realize it or not, manifests according to the Law of the Triangle, resulting from the conj unction of two conditions or two points. Illness is the third point of a particu lar triangle. The first point is none other than the sick person, for he or she is the on e enduring the suffering caused by his or her condition. He or she therefore consti tutes the passive principle of the triangle thus formed. The second point is defin ed by the cause of the illness which, in this particular case, represents the acti ve principle. As long as that cause remains unchecked, the illness will persist. It is therefore necessary to discover the cause and then cancel it. After having established the diagnosis, a little rest and appropriate treatment generally a llow healing to take place. To this “material” action should be added the spiritua l aid we may receive from the Cosmic. For this to occur, the instructions giv en in the booklet Liber 888— Council of Solace should be followed. After the cause of suffering is neutralized, the corresponding triangle ceases t o exist, for the second point has been canceled. Illness then disapp ears and the patient recovers his or her health."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22 Rosicrucian Order AMORC Neophyte Section Atrium 1 Number 14 To conclude our study of the Law of the Triangle, w e must specify that for centuries Rosicrucians have made a distinction betw een its material application and its spiritual application, even if the principl es involved are the same. When applied to the material world, we symbolize this la w by a triangle whose point is directed upwards. In the absolute, such a triang le represents for Rosicrucians a perfect earthly manifestation. When applied to th e spiritual world, we use a triangle whose point is directed downwards. In co ntrast to the previous one, it is the mystical representation of a cosmica lly perfect manifestation. It sometimes happens that the two triangles are repres ented together, with the two interlaced, as in the Star of David or in Solomon’s seal. In this case, the symbol thus formed corresponds to the number 6 and evokes the union of the material and spiritual worlds, with all the manifestations p roper to them. In the Practical Application of this monograph you will find a repre sentation of the symbolism of the triangle as perpetuated by us in the Rosicru cian teachings.

The phenomenon of electricity constitutes a good example of this particular application of the Law of the Trian gle. As for the second triangle, it represents the typical plan that any s piritual manifestation follows. That is why its point is directed downward .

By virtue of that law , no one can use the power of thought to exert a negative influence upon us, because Cosmic Consciousness does not relay this kind of influence . The Law of the Triangle is universal and applies to all that exists, whether on the material plane or the spiritual plane. It is based on the premise that a perfect and complete manifestation can occur only if two conditions of an opposing nature come together. When One and Two are placed in each other’s presence, they attract one another and from their union is born Three , a third condition which, in itself, is the point of manifestation of the triang le thus formed. The popular saying “Everything comes in threes” ill ustrates the Law of the Triangle—that is, when two opposing conditions are brought together, their union results if no internal or external agen t opposes it. Before starting on any new project, we should menta lly set out our plans in the form of a triangle and very carefully determ ine the two conditions we must combine to obtain the desired result. For centuries, Rosicrucians have made a distinction between the material application and the spiritual application of the La w of the Triangle, even if the principles involved are the same. In Rosicrucian Tradition, a triangle whose point is directed upward represents a perfect earthly manifestation. A trian gle pointing downward symbolizes a perfect spiritual manifestation.
